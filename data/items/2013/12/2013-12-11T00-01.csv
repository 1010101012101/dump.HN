6885172,comment,6884369,6884369,5,0,hngiszmo,,,"Ok, my name is Leo and I&#x27;m an Android developer. In 2000 I actually investigated the potential of dynamic ride sharing and came to the conclusion it is not feasible due to software being in the hands of the network and device providers. Later, when Android and iOS came along I had other stuff to do but noticed how many tried to enter in this market and my conclusion is still that you would have to seed it in a way that you get at least 10,000 users in one big city to start with.<p>10,000 global users will just not cut it by many orders of magnitude. Charging $1 for an app to try it out will not help to get to critical mass.<p>Please, other Leo, make the first year for free for your own and nature&#x27;s good. I&#x27;m dreaming of ad hock ride shares becoming a reality since sooooo long and guess it would only work if it was pre-installed and activated by default on many many phones but then it could really have a huge impact on the global CO2 output.<p>Further thoughts on the app:\nMake it social:<p><pre><code>  * Users should be able to pick who they want to ride with, including age, sex, car brand etc. Stricter filters are less rides.\n  * Users should be able to pick who they don&#x27;t want to ride with, little or bad feedback for example\n  * Users should be able to contact their ride partners without sharing any Facebook names, phone numbers etc.\n  * Optionally Users should be checked in on their rides for security. For extra paranoia, the app could send a special message to a contact person if the user doesn&#x27;t check out from a ride. Ride sharing is little popular out of security concerns and full track of one&#x27;s movement with check-in on a ride should reduce risks involved dramatically.\n  * Let the driver define a price per km (for friends, friends of friends, others)\n  * ask if you want more ideas. This is endless but I guess my post will not be noticed by the other Leo anyway ;)</code></pre>",1386723489

Eg, Dave&#x27;s Zert Manufacturing vs Trendy Bay Co<p>* &#x27;Instructor&#x27; can simply be a high-end gradient of many different roles. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily say &#x27;non-coder&#x27;.  A senior architect can be understood to be an instructor of sorts. How this is all documented on a resume is fairly flexible.<p>* Academic teaching time would definitely typecast you negatively as a programmer, but not so much with System Administration experience.  I&#x27;d avoid it unless you are headed into Academia.  I don&#x27;t have any very specific examples of this other than the perception I had of various co-workers who had come from university jobs.  They had detectable institutionalization.<p>My general advice would be to have a clear picture of where you want to end up and do your best to have each link in the chain moving you in the same direction.  It&#x27;s easy to justify getting sidetracked by relationships, geography, and economic considerations.<p>I&#x27;ll end with a useless caveat about subjective answers.

The return of progressive enhancement, I suppose - but even better because of pushState, indexeddb, etc.<p>That&#x27;s if there&#x27;s truly some benefit. Server-side rendering has its place, but probably isn&#x27;t important for apps on the very &quot;app&quot; side of the content-app spectrum. What makes me want very easy to use server-side rendering, even for apps, is the fact that so many of those apps have embedded content - say an email in Gmail - that it&#x27;d be great to reuse the same templating if it&#x27;s later deemed important to have a link to a static version of the content &quot;outside&quot; of the app.",1386723455

And here we get real hypothetical ... you think the company has legs and that your stock might be worth something.  But your strike price is $.05 per share and fair market value on Common Shares now is $1.50 per share.  If you exercise your three years of options at this point hoping for the likely $10 per share IPO, you&#x27;re stuck paying immediate regular income tax rates on your $1.45 per share immediate paper gain.

The question is if the <i>physical</i> design of suburbia is influenced by the desire to keep undesirables out, above and beyond any sort of legislative or extralegal measures already being undertaken at the time.<p>There aren&#x27;t any easy answers here. I think it&#x27;s quite self-evident, but obviously there is room for disagreement. One of the defining feature of modern suburbs is the &quot;gate&quot; - the limitation of access points to nearby arterial streets. It&#x27;s fairly obvious (and even a perk for buyers) that this effectively separates the road network within from the outside and discourages through-traffic. The main claimed benefit here is safety - but from what?<p>One oft-claimed safety improvement is traffic. This isn&#x27;t really true as pedestrian fatalities are still comparable to urban areas. But I am willing to accept that people <i>believe</i> they are getting improved traffic safety in these places.<p>The other oft-claimed safety improvement is crime. The idea is that if you make through-traffic a giant pain in the ass, then anyone who is there who doesn&#x27;t live there is likely up to no good, and it makes troublemakers and potential criminals easier to spot. This is not illogical - and it agrees with Oscar Newman&#x27;s Defensible Space theory.<p>The question is to what extent that is classist. This is where things get murky. We know a few things from the early days of suburbia:<p>- Cities were experiencing high crime and violence, and suffering from a particularly compressed housing market due to the sudden return of millions of servicemen. This is the primary force that purged people out of urban centers and into newly developed suburbs.<p>- Only the middle and upper-middle classes could afford cars. Suburbia (in that format) was fundamentally incompatible with public transit. Occasionally this was an <i>enforced</i> incompatibility - see: Robert Moses and the low overpasses on Long Island.<p>- Suburban developments were explicitly advertised as an escape from the gritty, dangerous cities of yore. Many were explicitly segregationist. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s <i>at all</i> a stretch to say that separation from the poor (and black, if you want to go there) was a substantial motivator for early suburbs. Like today, personal safety is one of the main selling points of suburbs, the contention is to what extent that was code for &quot;because no poor people here&quot;.<p>- The design of suburban street layouts to minimize usefulness as through-roads is deliberate and an oft-touted selling point. The contention is to what extent this was an aesthetic preference vs. an exclusionary tactic. This is a hard one, since even during those times people were less-than-explicit about motivations against the poor.<p>The use of street design as a class/crime barrier has been very transparent and blatant in the past - even the recent past. For example: <a href=\"http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1996-05-03/news/1996124052_1_guilford-barrier-barricade\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1996-05-03/news/1996124052_...</a><p>Most other cases are not quite as blatant and clearcut. There is grayness between simply wanting safe neighborhoods and wanting all poor people out.",1386722525

We rode buses / walked / biked to work, rode buses for weekend trips (Vancouver is great in that regard. You can even go to a lot of hiking/skiing spots by bus). And for the occasional out-of-city trip we used a Zipcar. I think that overall, the time you would spend taking care of your own car (repair/fuel/clean/etc), balances out with the time you spend walking/waiting for buses, etc. With the added advantage of physical activity when being forced to walk or bike instead of drive. It is hard to resist the temptation of using a car when you own one. Another advantage of the bus is that you get to do stuff while commuting. I used that time to read books. And I think I&#x27;ve read more books in those 3 years than what I had the 10 years before.",1386722518

I was actually at my desk programming at 4:31AM when it hit.  It was, by far, the most violent quake I have ever experienced.  The vertical component was brutal.  It actually shot me up off my chair when it compressed the height adjusting air cylinder and propelled me upwards.  I have this vivid memory of being up in the air along with all the books in the bookcases surrounding my desk.  The lights went out.  We all came down.  The shaking begun.<p>Anyhow, after it stopped I was covered in a pile of books.  I made sure everyone was OK, found my car keys and got out of the house.  I threw some tools int the back of the car and immediately drove near CSUN where my girlfriend lived and picked her up.  Her place was trashed.  We helped a few of her neighbors.  We gave a few of them rides to nearby friends and family.  We also visited some of our friends in the neighborhood to make sure they were OK.  Being the guy with a garage full of tools, I probably helped a dozen, if not two dozen, people with various issues from gas main shutoffs to broken water pipes and a whole range of other things that happen during a bad quake.  In the days that followed we helped get water and supplies to those in need and generally made ourselves useful to the extent possible.  Of course, we had our own issues to deal with, which required frequent trips to the hardware store to haul construction materials.<p>After that incident I never go to sleep without my gas tank at least half full and never leave my car keys on a table (because I had to dig them out of a pile of stuff when all of it went to the floor).  My car was the single most valuable tool during that incident.<p>Many years later.  Now married, living elsewhere, with a young child and a couple of dogs in tow our neighborhood was surrounded by fire.  The hills around us just went up in flames.  We were told evacuation was imminent.  My wife, kid and dogs went into our two SUV&#x27;s while I went in and out of the house prioritizing what to bring into the cars.  We actually had to drive a block away from our home before we were told the situation had reversed and we could go back.<p>I realize these are extreme examples, but to say that public transportation is all you need is kind of unreasonable.  It&#x27;s almost like saying that the police force is all you need in order to keep you and your family safe.  As a tourist I&#x27;ve always enjoyed public transport in Europe.  Love it.  If I lived there I would most certainly own a car or two.  Public transport isn&#x27;t going to be there when you need it most.<p>With the advent of electric cars a whole new set of possibilities starts to open up.  Electrics with long range capabilities have something no liquid fuel vehicle can offer:  easily convertible energy that --with the right equipment-- is compatible with the needs of any home.  In the event of an emergency your electric SUV&#x27;s could very well power your home and basic necessities such as lights, cooking and keeping food safe.",1386722305

If you are doing that, then older versions of the compiler will fail to parse the code, which would hopefully motivate the developer to upgrade their system-wide Go installation[0]. That way, they still only have one version of the compiler installed, and it will work for all programs they need to compile.<p>The <i>only</i> people who need to have multiple different versions of the gc compiler installed on their system are people who know what they&#x27;re doing and handle this themselves manually (ie, the core contributors to Go).<p>One of the explicit design goals of Go is to simplify the build process. A side-effect of this is that the build process and best practices are different for Go than for most other languages.<p>I appreciate the effort that you&#x27;ve put into trying to make this easy to deploy, but using Makefiles and local versions of the compiler in this way is generally bad practice for experienced Go programmers, and encourages bad habits for inexperienced Go programmers.<p>[0] Ubuntu&#x27;s repositories are hilariously behind the times on this.

Every group does this.<p>Frankly I find this pretty weak. If you want offensive pieces of known science relating to race, why not go with Darwin&#x27;s &quot;island species&quot;, which basically says that there are 2 ways evolution can go:<p>1) there are barriers (artificial or not) between races. At this point races slowly evolve into species (at which point they fully diverge). Racism is theorized to be one such barrier.<p>You might think the above is a bad situation ... until you think about the only alternative.<p>2) There are no barriers between races. At this point races are a temporary phenomenon : all but one race will die out. Now you might think that if you put 2 races of animal together the surviving group will be a mixed form, however that appears not to be the case. The result of mixing 2 races, is that one only a single race survives.<p>The reason is simple. Take &quot;most blacks&quot; genetic makeup in the united states. There was a period where people preferentially had kids with white people. This has resulted in that the large majority of african americans have a number of generations which were mixed-black + white person in their ancestry, increasing the ratio of white:african genes. The problem is what happens in a couple where a mixed + white marriage is in both parents&#x27; ancestry. When 2 second-generation mixed black marry, the odds are very good that the child will have more indo-european genes and less african ones than either of their parents. This is already plainly visible on the street in the US, if you&#x27;ve been to Africa. Most african americans lack several typical black characteristics (large lips, large color change between front and back of the hand, and the individual hairs on the skin are much thicker, but there are less of them) and in more internal characteristics (for instance there is barely any difference between african americans and whites in lactose intolerance anymore, whereas in Africa it&#x27;s easy to find regions with 80%+ of people lactose intolerant). It is no longer unheard of for 2 african-american parents to have a child that is white (in phenotype), and it&#x27;s about to become the norm.<p>Now while it&#x27;s true that the advantage of one set of genes was generated somewhat artificially for this group, the theory says that there will always be some reason that one group&#x27;s offspring will outnumber the other group (same argument as for natural selection, really), and this will always happen. Whether it be because of social preferences or some other property doesn&#x27;t really matter.",1386721752

Even if you don&#x27;t care much about equity, if you care about it at all you should be able to get that information.<p>1. Calculating a true percentage associated with a grant can be difficult. You can identify the number of shares of stock outstanding across all classes, the number of currently authorized shares, and the size of the option pool. But you don&#x27;t know how much of the option pool will actually be used, how many options will vest, etc.<p>2. Unless you&#x27;re an executive hire or unicorn, most companies will not give you all of the data necessary to meaningfully evaluate the equity grant. You can ask for it, as so many suggest, but asking for something that a) you almost certainly won&#x27;t receive and b) that you&#x27;re not trying to focus on (for the reasons I originally gave) is not very strategic.<p>3. At an early-stage, venture-backed startup (my comments are not intended to address late-stage, liquidity-all-but-certain scenarios), the equity structure of the company is likely to change considerably and perhaps unpredictably, rendering your initial evaluation all but useless.<p>4.

Maybe he only wants a job that&#x27;s a direct extension of his research? Or maybe he has a very strong personality that spooks his potential employers? Or maybe he just never learned how to code? In the absence of some compelling and uncommon reason, I can&#x27;t really imagine how a PhD in Computer Science (from a good school!) could fail to get a job right now.",1386721041

Ph.Ds are extremely unlikely to have any meaningful connections in this regard. This makes vetting them difficult as there is no one to vouch for them.<p>Location of papers is a decent metric, but more and more it&#x27;s an indicator of whether the Ph.D comes from an &#x27;in lab&#x27; in an &#x27;in field&#x27;.

(I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m not reading this into what you&#x27;re writing, if this is not your position I apologise, but anyway this is for the purpose of discussing said position in general.)  I disagree with this in general.  The act of feeding oneself is necessary for survival, whereas killing animals is not.<p>First of all, the animal couldn&#x27;t care less if someone treats its corpse with respect--it&#x27;s already dead, so I don&#x27;t see how the animal benefits from this.  Second, I&#x27;d say that the negative effects on the killer&#x27;s mind from the act of killing far outweigh any positive effects from mindfulness in handling food produced from the kill.<p>Killing desensitizes, you become accustomed to taking life from another sentient being.  The meat industry is likewise taking care to use every edible part of the animal, they&#x27;re not producing any waste as far as that goes.  Further, I don&#x27;t think eating everything in the plate is making any measurable difference in terms of total meat consumed (if that&#x27;s the implicit idea behind this).  It&#x27;s like the “think about the starving children in Africa” routine, which never made sense: people in Africa aren&#x27;t starving because kids in the West aren&#x27;t eating their whole dinners, and what good does cleaning the plate (i.e. making the food gone) do to remedy the situation. :)<p>> It&#x27;s a highly rewarding and enlightening process which I highly, highly recommend to anyone that eats meat.<p>The bottom line of what I&#x27;m trying to say is I just can&#x27;t see anything enlightening, let alone rewarding, in a process which necessitates killing other sentient beings.  Of course, there is absolutely no doubt that hunting is infinitely more ethical than what is being done by the meat industry.  It&#x27;s really incomparable, so if you have to eat meat do take care it&#x27;s from a reasonable source like hunting or “organic” (I hate that word) farming.  However, that likely doesn&#x27;t scale at all at the current levels of population.  In my mind the best thing to do would be to just stop killing animals for food.<p>Some time ago I came across this interesting Youtube video[0] but never got around to post it here, and this discussion reminded me of that[1].  Basically, this guy (a Theravada monk) summarizes almost perfectly what I&#x27;m trying to say.  Because of the horrible things industrial meat production does, I can&#x27;t quite agree with him that it&#x27;s OK to buy meat in the supermarket (as long as you&#x27;re not specifically desiring meat), but otherwise I think he is spot on.<p>[0] <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zisXgVnv-cI\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zisXgVnv-cI</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6884572\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6884572</a>",1386720248

Automating it is easy, and it has long ago lost its prestige.<p>Re MBA guys - maybe we have a different understanding of MVP here. I don&#x27;t mean PowerPoint-ware - I mean version 0.1 of a product solving real problems. MBAs that are working on something more complex than yet another social network will immediately look for an engineer.<p>I&#x27;m not missing the average/maximum-complexity point at all, but I have a different view on it than you do. The average complexity won&#x27;t stay constant, it&#x27;ll keep increasing, and the average programmer will have to adapt. Will that mean a reduction in demand? I doubt it - we&#x27;ve yet to see the full extent of how software can be used. On the flip side, I constantly see clients looking for someone to fix or alter their &quot;automated&quot; installations - the average programmer will surely be in enough demand from these cases alone.",1378169953

The fact that blogs are inconsistent is just the symptom, warning sign even, one that reflects more on the state of AngularJS documentation and APIs than those who blog about it.<p>The <i>problem</i> to me seems to be both with the official documentation (or lack thereof) as well as inconsistencies in the design of Angular&#x27;s APIs themselves which I find tend to lead people towards many different interpretations and implementations in practice.<p>The truth is part of this is simply the maturity of the project which is perhaps unavoidable but some part of it is that the Angular core team just does not seem to be taking documentation or at least clearly defining best practices as a very high priority. However I would argue it should be. At least equal to core development itself. If you don&#x27;t first clearly define how you expect people to use your APIs then how can you really expect to design them in a way that is easy to understand and use?<p>The state of the Angular docs are unacceptable at the present time, and I just don&#x27;t think crowdsourced solutions like those presented here are a sufficient solution. I can&#x27;t think of (help me out here) any other examples where a high-quality open source project gets it&#x27;s documentation completely from crowd sourced, after-the-fact, community edits. Good documentation has to be set as a standard. Sure lean on the community but please don&#x27;t just expect to &quot;build it and the community will write the docs&quot; is going to work out.",1378169738

It is a lot more mature (from the perspective of running a software business) to have this level of control over your destiny. It is also another step away from the engineering driven focus toward the business goals focus. One of the more difficult things to do is have the conversation why something is correct for the business, even if it is an inferior engineering solution. I hope they manage that transition well.<p>The other part of this story seems to be that if you move to this as your &quot;api&quot; then you can move the underlying OS tech to something else as well. (away from Linux to something perhaps smaller for a budget phone.) Should be easier than it was for Microsoft to move everyone to the WinAPI and off DOS.",1378169695

Most programmers struggle to pick up Lisp, Haskell and ML for the first time, but those are unambiguously programming. TeX is usually a bit tricky too.<p>> Meanwhile, a web developer who only knows HTML and CSS is entirely unprepared to do any serious work in any real programming language, and would be starting from scratch if he decided to pick up C.<p>Much as it pains me to do this, I cite Node.js as a counter example. People can and do write systems software using their understanding of Javascript as a basis. They may not do it well, but I know for a fact I could write certain types of servers acceptably well with it (I would prefer other tools, though).<p>Note that just because Ryah and co do not know how to write systems software, the basic principle is <i>not</i> invalidated. With some serious hacking to the node.js vm, it could be a viable competitor to Erlang.<p>This argument is incredibly weak, and basically self-refuting. But we have to repeat it every now and then.<p>> but it does mean that the process of telling a computer what to do and the process of telling a computer &quot;here&#x27;s some text, and here&#x27;s some guidelines about how you should display it&quot; don&#x27;t inform each other.<p>You keep re-asserting this but haven&#x27;t given any quantitive metrics for how it is different.

My family has hosted many international guests through exchange programs, including adult guests who had never left their home country (but were taught English at school).

When exchanges move from blank looks to questions about particular words used, you can start having clunky conversations.<p>The exchange programs did give our family tips on how to converse with the guests. The only tip I can remember is to try and use different words. Often the longer and fancier word (e.g. gigantic, massive) is easier to understand for the guest than the short and simple word (e.g. big).",1378169070

So if you do have a working version on a PAAS, they might potentially break it. With your own environment you can test your software with new versions before upgrading.<p>Ideally a PAAS should provide an automated framework to run any tests you have to see whether to run you in an upgraded environment, otherwise run you on a legacy environment until  you are ready to switch.

So here&#x27;s an example. Apparently the reason that most medical devices run on Windows NT (as opposed to, say, Linux) is that Windows NT is already certified for that use, so it becomes easier to certify your custom MRI scanner because you can just include the pre-certified Windows NT part and only have to get the new code your company wrote certified. Similarly, seL4 is the only OS I can think of that has been formally verified (i.e. proven correct mathematically); I&#x27;m quite certain none of {Windows, Darwin, Linux} has been formally proven to be correct.<p>When I attended a recent talk at my local university, I found out that the shutdown routines for a local nuclear power plant were running on 40-year-old mainframes because those mainframes were certified to survive earthquakes and things. Work was in progress to find new hardware and rewrite those routines, although the Engineer I spoke to was under the impression that none of the hardware made in the last decade was certified to operating under the same level of confidence.",1378167898

They&#x27;re called compilers.<p>Compilers automate a simple but tedious translation process. They do not &quot;write programs&quot;, they merely translate (hopefully in a deterministic way) one stream of text (PL code) into another stream of text (machine code). They apply no creativity to the problem, and indeed was once done by hand with what were essentially secretary pools (Grace Hopper got her start there, thankfully she moved up pretty quickly). Compilers eliminated this work, but the persons handing the high-level programs to the &quot;human compilers&quot; (the former usually men, the latter usually women, the 50s were pretty sexist) still had a job that was relatively the same (just now they had to deal with punchcards).<p>> Programming is still challenging. That won&#x27;t end in the next 50 years.<p>Programming ends as a profession of course once we hit singularity, which is anywhere from 20 to 100 years away depending on who you ask. We already do not code many systems by hand, but instead meta-code algorithms to generate these systems from corpus training inputs (aka machine learning). No one would try and build a speech recognition system by hand anymore. We will see machine learning increasingly encroaching on what used to be pure programming tasks.",1378166976

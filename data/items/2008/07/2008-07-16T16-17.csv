247713,comment,247669,247669,0,0,hugh,,,"Makes sense to me. Internet companies are getting by on ever-decreasing amounts of funding, while huge firms like KP have an ever-increasing amount of money they need to invest. Internet companies and KP aren't interested in talking about the same sorts of money any more. It makes sense that their attention should be shifted to big expensive projects like biotech and fuel cells. Whether that will pay off for them remains to be seen, but from a technology point of view I hope that it will.",1216227132

Basically, I believe that Apple's products are more awesome than the market thinks, because the market is non-technical on average and so doesn't fully comprehend just how cool Apple's products are, and treats it more like just any other technology company.<p>I'm not a financial analyst, though, so this is not backed by any data, if that's what you're asking :-)",1216227113

More like making generalisations dangerous (Although I am sure you will be able to pick apart my post to find plenty of generalisations, too).<p>> The average American diet is, to use your inflammatory language, ""outright suicidal for an average middle-American"". It's high fat, high sugar, low fiber, and low in nutrients (unless ""fortified"" with artificial concentrations of vitamins and minerals), and it is nothing like previous American generations diet.<p>I did not at any point advocate that Americans eat the average American diet. Nor did I mean any offense to America, merely to the diet. I don't eat such a diet, nor do I eat the average Russian diet since leaving that region. The point I am making is that accepting any extreme view on dietary requirements is a strange thing to do considering how little we understand about the workings of our metabolism, regardless of how many cultures have enjoyed such a diet for countless millennia. [edit: I realise you did not advocate such a position, either. But plenty of people misinterpret statements like the one I quoted to do just that.]<p>I am sure tofu is great, and has lots of science behind it. So does consuming red meat. Or milk. They also have lots of science pointing to the contrary. But most of those scientific arguments apply to extreme cases. In the right environment, eating an occasional steak will not give you a heart attack or colon cancer, just as eating a few soy beans will not make you impotent. But excluding foods on the basis of current scientific understanding strikes me as more damaging, if it turns out that those foods carried nutrients we previously did not understand. Of course, dietary requirements based on religious or moral principles are something else entirely.<p>Seems like we agree on the general principles, the devil is in the implementation details, and one's risk profile.",1217203113

According to the official figures, GDP has been just a little above flat (~0.5%) for well over a year now.<p>But, everyone knows that inflation is really far greater than the official ~2.5%/year though.

258502,comment,258424,258424,0,0,markbao,,,"Not all businesses need to be long-term. For example, one of the possible goals of a startup is to build technology that offers a lot of value, and then find an exit that makes sense. One of those exits is to be purchased by a company that can utilize your developed technology, or that can further create value and/or revenue for that acquiring company.<p>Where do we see this? MySQL by Sun. Flektor by Fox. WebEx by Cisco. Virtual Ubiquity/Buzzword by Adobe. Zimbra by Yahoo!.<p>Therefore, building a long-term business is not as important as building a lot of value for the market.",1217202245

Microsoft's Mac Business Unit (MBU) puts out decent software and works pretty well.

258487,comment,258201,258418,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Depends, I guess, on what it's in.<p>Traditional tempeh is fermented, and so is generally quite friendly.  Tofu, as I mentioned, is basically soy milk curd.<p>But most instances, in US groceries, where something contains ""soy protein"" it's going to be in the form of soy flour, or soy milk (which is generally soy flour, water, sugar), which, unless fermented for soy sauce and tempeh or made into tofu, has phytoestrogens to one degree or another.<p>I've never actually found good data on this topic, and it's an area of interest since I'm vegetarian.  I enjoy some of the soy-based meat alternatives (Boca Burgers, Morning Star Farms products, etc.), but many contain soy (as well as wheat gluten) in forms that are poorly defined, so I suspect they are subject to this problem.  I generally avoid them for that reason.  I'd be curious to know what processes <i>do</i> break down those compounds, if any others besides fermentation and turning into tofu do.

They spend a lot of money on R&D...they could acquire this company in a heartbeat as they did Z-Corp and  Huntsman in the past.  Innovative companies like this help the overall Rapid Prototyping market move forward....DDD and SSYS are the big fish with  distribution, service, infrastructure and the the capital ready to make sensible acquisitions.   It would be a different story if this was a mature market with slowing growth and new uses were not being found for the technology everyday.   It is conceivable that the way this technology is moving forward, we will be printing Clothing, Houses, Body Parts, etc.  So there is a lot of room in this market....this is just the very beginning (OR I should say, the ""end of the beginning"" as the tech has been around for 20 years and now finally hitting the mainstream).",1348671542

However you're correct, in that context it could be a useful metric when the goals are very focused, the targets are well defined, and the growth is directly correlated. He could be entirely right in this context, you're right.<p>It is my opinion that this sort of thinking builds unsustainable companies. There either needs to be an incredible shift in the way growth is looked at and achieved at some point in the company's life (which to me, seems unlikely or at least a difficult change of course)or the company can start out with sustainable growth in mind. There is no reason that a company designed for overall quality rather than speed cannot <i>also</i> be a fast growing company; but I think they'll look at their strategy much differently. And that way of thinking will last them through hiring, market expansion, and beyond.<p>Maybe they are compatible strategies and I'm just over-thinking it.

So you can think of it as a winner-takes-all in the high end and another in the low. Of course competition should and will happen (I have hopes on FirefoxOS), but in these markets the new player usually storms in with domino network effects and pulls dominance to his side.

It's actually a simple manifestation of a standard form of human irrationality, the availability heuristic [1]. The people making these decisions sit there and fear what may be done to their property, and while they are sitting there imagining all the things that may be done, that ends up swamping all the other possibilities in their head. They imagine they're just going to catch two sorts of images: People normally using the laptop, and people stealing or hurting it. (And I am sure that if you asked them to guess how many images of abuse they'd catch that they would overestimate by at least two orders of magnitude.) The availability heuristic has crowded out all the other sorts of images they will capture in what is very nearly a random sampling of the full range of home life.<p>So the people end up as surprised as can be that they end up with what is legally child porn on their hands. I really don't think that these companies are setting out to collect that on purpose. They're just taking doing something skeevy, but seemingly safe, under the guidance of a normal human irrationality we all have, and end up bitten by it. <i>Even if</i> they do in fact have somewhat malicious purposes and want to catch some sort of other image they shouldn't want, they will still end up over-imagining how much of that they will catch, and not realize how much other stuff they will catch.<p>Your examples are not comparable, in that they all include clear intent.<p>And if you are really inclined to argue ""But they should have known!""... well... are you so sure you're completely conversant in all possible legal issues arising in fields completely outside of your experience?

For pete's sake, you should <i>not</i> be measuring your growth numerically and targeting it weekly. This is <i>not</i> what Paul meant, and I don't think it's what he would recommend.<p>Growth happens on a larger and more complex scale than a weekly sum. Furthermore, if you're expecting your actions for any given week to correlate directly with growth that happens that week, you're doing it wrong.<p>Do you need to work hard? Of course. Should you procrastinate? Of course not. Is the key to this <i>tracking your weekly growth.</i> No! You risk misdirecting your efforts, becoming far too short-sighted, and falling into the dangerous trap of running your company only on those quantifiable and measurable numbers. You risk missing the complexity which results in growth, and instead narrowing your focus to the point where it actually <i>stagnates</i> growth or produces the wrong kind of growth.<p>See W. Edwards Deming's management treatise that helped bring Japan out of a recession<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming#Key_principles"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming#Key_principle...</a> - one of his recommendations was to ""Eliminate management by objective. Eliminate management by numbers and numerical goals. Instead substitute with leadership."" And a pitfall he pointed out""Running a company on visible figures alone."" More can be found in his books, which mostly are targeted toward manufacturing but I find apply incredibly well to software business.<p>Please, don't limit yourself to this sort of narrow-minded analysis of your business, or at least be very aware of the consequences and consider it only as an interesting result, never use it as a target or benchmark, and especially don't use it to try to motivate or pressure your employees. Your results will slowly shift toward optimizing your measured goal alone, and your company will become as narrow and pointless as the number.<p>Can this metric be used? Of course. You can look back on your efforts over the long (or short) term, and if you see a decent 6% growth rate, great. If you don't, then you may need to change something. But you have to understand it intimately; that it's not a goal, not a target, but a simple metric to be used post-facto to make useful and realistic changes to your strategy. I'm not warning you against using all numeric analysis, but I am warning against using it as a true goal or target. Just keep it in perspective, and I fear a web site that makes the metric as clear and visible as this site does brings it far too close to the front of your daily attention than it should be.<p>Growth comes from many complex sources, toward many time frames and overarching goals; and the target is not a weekly number, but instead, a growing and sustainable company.

It's also increasingly irrelevant given how much game playing has shifted to consoles and mobile. (Arguably, this--along with the iPod/iPhone/iPad halo effect--has helped fuel the Mac's gain in share. Breadth of desktop apps doen't matter as much as it used to.)",1348668158

My device has <i>a lot</i> of scratches and scuffs, it has been magically lifting itself out of my pocket on a few occasions including riding a bike at full speed. Needless to say, when it hit the ground it not only totally disassembled itself, it also received a few more scratches here and there. My MacBook Pro is different by the way, no scratches after lots and lots of usage.<p>The verdict: I couldn't care less. It's a phone and after putting the battery back in and the cover on, it <i>never</i> ceased to work, it didn't even change my user experience in any way (broken glass, buttons etc.)<p>I would not buy a phone that <i>requires</i> me to put in in an ugly case, but I would also not care much about a few scratches here and there as long as the phone doesn't <i>break</i>.<p>So if you buy a phone partially for it's supposedly amazing design and <i>then</i> hide it inside those ugly rubber casings or whine about small scratches, well, than you lost me along the way.",1348668113

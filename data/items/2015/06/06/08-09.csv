I have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about.<p>It is not really confusing that you can&#x27;t have both MoveFilesEx and MoveFileSex in the same scope (and that you can refer to a variable or procedure by a either name). Nim just feels like taking this a little farther - making &#x27;_&#x27; the lower case version of no character. Not at all a big jump from Pascal, and pascal is not confusing.<p>In fact, experiments teaching Python to non-programmers indicated that the two biggest confusing issues were case <i>sensitivity</i> and integer division[0].<p>> The Nim &quot;solution&quot; is one of the things that kept me from even wanting to spend two hours checking it out.<p>That sentiment is very often expressed by people coming from C/C++/Java about Python&#x27;s indentation (What? Whitespace is significant to semantics? That&#x27;s awful!). And you know what?

This means that the only way to implicitly introduce a `&mut` is via a method call like `foo.bar()` that takes `&mut self`, but also consider that it would be impossible to call the method here unless `foo` were explicitly declared as mutable to begin with.

So a Vec<u8>&#x27;s buffer looks like this:<p><pre><code>    [u8|u8|u8|u8]\n</code></pre>\nand a Vec for a struct { u8, u32, u8 } looks like this (ignoring padding):<p><pre><code>    [u8,u32,u8|u8,u32,u8|u8,u32,u8|u8,u32,u8]\n</code></pre>\nIf you want to store both A and B inline in a Vec you&#x27;ve got trouble: that they both implement Foo doesn&#x27;t mean they have the same size at all (and they often don&#x27;t), and Rust&#x27;s type system doesn&#x27;t allow it anyway (`A: Foo` says that A implements Foo, but the function or collection still gets an A via reification and monomorphisation).<p>The alternative is to do what languages Java or Go do under the covers: add a fixed-size pointer as indirection between the collection and the actual items (the pointer is actually fat, you get a pointer to the instance itself and a pointer to the vtable for the trait implementation, I think Go does the same but java doesn&#x27;t as each instance has its classpointer), so you get e.g.<p><pre><code>    [&A|&A|&B|&A]\n</code></pre>\nall pointers are the same size and things work out. More generally than trait objects, you need to do this to store any unsized type (<a href=""http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/unsized-types.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/unsized-types.html</a>) in something which only accepts sized types.",1433579078

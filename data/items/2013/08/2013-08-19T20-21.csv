6239768,comment,6236478,6236478,8,0,Tzunamitom,,,"First let me start by saying I am someone who has worked almost exclusively doing a &quot;bullshit job&quot;, in fact if there were a scale of bullshit jobs, I think that Management Consulting would probably be placed at the apex of bullshit.<p>I have felt the pain described, and was with the author right up until the point where they started talking about the tube workers, which struck a nerve. Tube drivers can bring the system to its knees because they are highly unionised and can (and do) choose to strike en masse whenever they&#x27;re not happy with working conditions, salary, proposed changes etc.
What is one of their strongest oppositions? Automated tube driving systems. Systems that would make the tube network cheaper to run, increase capacity, improve speed and safety, and yes, make tube drivers redundant.<p>So here we are, and the TGWU (transport union) et al are basically ruining my day-to-day commute to keep tube drivers in their cushy positions, maintaining an inefficient situation that makes the tube drivers &quot;indispensable&quot;. I&#x27;m gonna call bullshit on that.<p>Now let&#x27;s say that some miracle happens and somehow the TGWU racket is broken and progress is allowed to happen. TfL (Transport for London) decide to replace all of their train drivers (why the hell are humans driving trains in the 21st century anyway???) with computerised systems. Who&#x27;s gonna do that? Who&#x27;s gonna plan, design, build, test, implement and maintain such a massively complex system? The tube drivers? Don&#x27;t think so. I&#x27;ll give you good odds that you&#x27;re going to be calling in the Management Consultants to do this. All of a sudden my bullshit job isn&#x27;t seeming like quite such bullshit when it is saving the taxpayer millions of pounds each year and reducing your morning commute by 20 minutes.<p>So here we come to the crux of the problem of this article. The yardstick by which you&#x27;ve chosen to determine if a job is &quot;worthwhile&quot; is whether anyone would notice if those workers disappeared. Given this definition, it is unsurprising that those jobs that have a very direct reward will seem the most worthwhile (i.e. nurse treats patient, patient feels better, patient happy, sees value in nurse). This feels right because it fits in nicely with the short-term worlds that most of us humans live in.<p>Unfortunately, the problem is not necessarily (or just) the bullshit jobs, but our bullshit caveman short-term brains that haven&#x27;t yet caught up to the 21st century highly-optimised economy in which we live. As Dan Pink notes in Drive, to be motivated, we humans need 3 things - autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Our bullshit jobs are (for the most part) giving us autonomy and mastery more than any grunt jobs since the Industrial Revolution began, but what is lacking is purpose. We feel our jobs are bullshit precisely because they seem to lack purpose. They seem to lack purpose because we are so many levels removed from the output and effect of the things that we do.<p>I&#x27;ll give you an example. I worked on a project that improved information security standards at all of the petrol (gas) stations for an oil giant worldwide. This project changed how things worked at 45,000 petrol (gas) stations worldwide, and statistically speaking, likely saved quite a few customers from card or identity fraud while refuelling their cars. Except I have no idea if it did or not - I&#x27;ll never meet these guys or hear their stories, hell I barely left the office, and most of the things I did were in Excel or PowerPoint.<p>So there&#x27;s the problem. Did I make a difference? Yeah probably. Do I emotionally feel like I made a difference? Nope. Not a bit. I was far too detached from the outcome to feel that. Looks great on my CV (resume) though for when I apply for my next bullshit job.<p>So to me, the answer isn&#x27;t rushing out to quit our bullshit jobs and becoming tube drivers, or building houses in developing countries, although we&#x27;d probably be happier doing so. The answer is re-attaching the purpose element to the highly-productive &quot;bullshit&quot; jobs that we do, and reprogramming our caveman brains to realise that Excel really is mightier than the sword, and that we can be of far more use to the world by adapting our highly-optimised productivity systems to be more meaningful, rather than dismantling them and returning to an enjoyable but unproductive primary-secondary economy.",1376945741

6239731,comment,6238615,6238615,85,0,devindotcom,,,"Something I noticed while in India myself, which may help explain (not excuse) <i>some</i> of the behavior (please note I am not discounting the author&#x27;s perspective at all):<p>I&#x27;m a little over 6 feet, blond hair and green eyes, and when I and my family were visiting India (Mumbai and a few other areas around Maharashtra), we got stared at really, really hard. Like everyone around us literally stopping on the street and doing nothing but stare.<p>It was unnerving, naturally, and I asked my brother and his (now) wife about it, since they had been living there for about a year. They told me, and I later observed for myself, that this type of looking and curiosity is part of how Indians generally are. It&#x27;s very honest, very unapologetic, and once you get over the taboo of the stare, very disarming. It&#x27;s not just visiting Westerners either - they stare at each other, watch each other honestly, will walk across the street to get a better look, and crowd around something interesting. I saw it constantly and eventually understood it as a lack of interpersonal barriers that arise in a highly individualistic society. Everything is shared because in a city of 15-20 million people, there&#x27;s hardly any space apart. People in major metro areas understand some aspect of this but it&#x27;s hard to really grasp unless you&#x27;re there.<p>The problem, of course, arises when this lack of barriers combines with misogyny of the boldest type. Getting used to the constant stares is one thing for me, a man (and taller than most of my observers by a head), but for a woman it must be extra difficult to accept - and that&#x27;s just the <i>stares</i>. The lack of respect for her space may be part of the collectivism that arises with incredible density, but the lack of respect for her body and humanity is not. It is rank and deep-seated sexism, and insitutionalized assault. There&#x27;s a culture supporting this (which is not to say that Indians as a people do) and it needs to be dragged into the light of day and shot.",1376945495

Negative permittivity is no big deal, metals act like an electron plasma gas around certain frequencies and get all weird, something like the color transmitted thru thin films of gold and how weird gold, silver, copper act in the THz range and all that.  The &quot;magic&quot; is creatively negating both .. At The Same Time.  Then the negative refraction  / metamaterial effects take hold.<p>Kind of like you can compress ammonia (a bit) and nothing terribly interesting happens, and you can cool ammonia gas (a bit) and nothing terribly interesting happens, but do both at the same time and you&#x27;ve invented liquid ammonia and refrigeration and all kinds of nifty stuff.<p>On the other hand energy/mass seems rather fundamental.  There are no multiple &quot;easily&quot; negatable components you can play with mixing together.  There&#x27;s no &quot;add a to b to get the mass&quot; going on.  So you can&#x27;t get sneaky with combinations and initial conditions to magically make negative mass/energy.  It&#x27;s really a different kind of problem.<p>The whole topic is pretty interesting to me because the first metamaterial stuff was constructed out of printed circuit boards with weird etchings right around the ham radio microwave 6cm and 9cm bands, which is right up my alley (doing weird ham radio things involving PCBs and such around those frequencies)  Unfortunately I have been unable to figure out any practical engineering demo (like, an antenna or a waveguide or some such) that would be ham radio applicable in a real world demonstration.  I guess I could make a really weird lens and place it in front of a 6cm horn waveguide antenna, but I can make a much simpler microwave lens antenna using about 1940s tech.  Lens antennas using plates of styrofoam and aluminum foil work pretty well at 10 GHz ham radio band for example, but I digress.<p>Metamaterials are kind of a solution in search of a problem right now, like lasers in 1960s or home computers in the 80s or whatever.  Most likely, much like the examples, it would be pretty hard to predict today just how important they might be in the future.

First, it&#x27;s imperative to acknowledge humans as primarily social creatures, always living in relation to a social context, not self-sustaining individuals. Some of our adaptations affect our functioning as members of a social body, rather than our health as individuals. Succeeding, finding a place, securing resources by trading, creating a context for ourselves within a family and/or community - all these things trigger reward mechanisms in the brain. Doing well? Biologically you&#x27;ll be stimulated to do even more in a positive feedback loop. Not doing well? Failing to find your place? Then you&#x27;ll be anti-stimulated towards, essentially, death. you weren&#x27;t working out, no need to prolong the dysfunction.<p>Of course, this &#x27;adaptation&#x27; causes tremendous prolonged suffering as it plays out, in practice.",1376943913

6239497,comment,6238395,6239025,14,0,benched,,,"This view, this dichotomy, is popular, insidious, infuriating to me as a sufferer, and very overgeneralized as far as I can tell. I guarantee you I have suffered very &#x27;real&#x27; depression, even been diagnosed several times if you&#x27;re into that, and it just so happens that I have always been able to articulate the causes. There may be people who are not able to articulate causes at a given time, for whatever reason - but even that does not mean causes aren&#x27;t there.<p>The way I see it is this. Life as a biological organism <i>is</i> a two-way interaction between your biological systems, and the putative &#x27;outside world&#x27;. And most of what you experience as your life occurs within your brain. There is lots of feedback between your brain and the outside world, notably between your brain and the brains of others. And there is lots of feedback within your own brain, with itself. This is all true for every person, whether or not you happen to have had a run-in with the first-world, western mental health system, and received a &#x27;diagnosis&#x27; based on someone&#x27;s observation of a small part of your process that is deemed dysfunctional.<p>What we call depression is extremely common, but we don&#x27;t like it and we wish we didn&#x27;t have to experience it, so we call it an illness. But it is a very common reaction to certain types of adversity: abuse, failures, disappointments, dissolution of important relationships. Such patterns are well-known even to clinicians. The view of depression as just a &#x27;disease&#x27; that afflicts the brain for no reason... I can&#x27;t imagine where this originated. I&#x27;ve experienced deep depression, numerous times, and I&#x27;ve known people who did as well. I could tell you all the reasons. Maybe they make happy people uncomfortable. I know that when I&#x27;ve been happy, it has been tempting to believe that I earned it, chose it, made it for myself - something self-empowering.<p>The reasons for depression usually boil down to prolonged alienation and frustration. Being in a place in life that is maladaptive, and not being able to find a way out in a short amount of time. Not being able to find a job, not being able to make friends or find love, or being in a relationship that is very unhappy and not being able to get out. Being in some life situation that can&#x27;t be willed out of, like having a felony record, or an incurable disease. Not having completed enough education. Having low self-esteem or perceiving oneself to be a failure, for subjective but still real reasons like being ugly, overweight, or socially awkward.<p>I feel like one of the causes of the persistent misunderstanding of this condition is that most people seem to want to believe happy people are in control of their happiness (whether that means being in control of their external conditions, or control of their attitude), and also want to excuse depressed people from having to be in control of their depression. This is partly sensible, and perhaps rightly motivated, because happiness is characterized by feeling in sufficient control of ones state of being, and depression is a state of prolonged lack of control. But this does not in any way suggest that the depression was random. Look behind that defeated, disconnected state of mind, turn back the clock, and you will find events that led the person into that horrible state.",1376943407

At the end of the day, probably nobody (or a small handful of people) on HN are actually qualified to offer a proper diagnosis.  So the rest of us can speculate all we want, but for someone who <i>is</i> depressed, to be perceived as making light of their situation, or dismissing it, might actually lead them to an even worse place.<p>Of course, I have no idea if Brad Feld reads HN or not, so maybe it&#x27;s a moot point in this specific case.

4755860,comment,4748624,4753796,1,0,gd1,,,"I think we are getting closer to understanding here.  You're kind of quibbling over the definition of value in your other post - someone can provide a ""valuable"" service even if it isn't currently being used (by your 'real transactors').  I might sleep better at night knowing that if I want to liquefy my investment in Apple tomorrow, I can do so without having to worry that nobody will be there to take the other side of the trade, that I'll have to pay an enormous spread or be left holding a position I want to be out of.  An international corporation can be more confident of planning their cashflows knowing that the FX market will always be liquid, and will be quoting at most 2 ticks wide in the majors 24 hours a day every day.  This is the oil of an economy, the freedom to allocate capital when you want, where you want and pay the smallest possible friction costs to do so.<p>Many things in our economy can be described as a zero-sum game.  Society only needs so much of any given good, and at the retailer level you aren't involved in increasing demand.  
Two corner stores might get into a price/advertising war, but let's argue that there is still only a fixed amount of product they can sell to a small community.  So advertiser's get fat on fees (in our case, exchanges do).  So what is the point you ask?  Evolution, competition, it can only be good for the consumer.  You still haven't disputed that by the way, the consumer wins don't they?  How could they possibly have lost?  It takes a tin foil hat to think that it isn't better and cheaper to invest now.<p>"" they are not selected by the quality of the service, just ability to rip each other off"" - people have a bit of a naive view that there are some sort of magical harlem globetrotter moves you can pull on an order book.  The mechanics are dead simple I'm afraid.  It isn't chess, not even checkers.  You can't even see the other participants, everything is anonymous on the exchanges I've dealt with.  Spoofing is illegal, and that is about as clever as it gets.  Very little you can do to make your algo better will put it at odds with providing a better quality service.<p>To prove that, remember the two types of algo. If I write a liquidity provider that <i>doesn't</i> offer a tighter spread than the competition, I will miss out on trade flow and make little or nothing.  If I write a liquidity taker that has an opinion that is <i>wrong</i> about the correct value of a security, someone else who is <i>right</i> will smash me.  So effectively we are selecting for more liquidity, tighter spreads, and more accurate prices reflecting available information.",1352332736

4755851,comment,4755470,4755594,52,0,SkyMarshal,,,"I both agree and disagree.<p>On the one hand I think it's worth specifically ""buying for life"" [1], eg buying high quality, durable things once and reusing them indefinitely.  Reject our throw-away culture and planned obsolescence, be more effecient and less wasteful with natural resources, recognizing that unless you plan to be a full-on monk you will most likely need to buy some things in life.<p>On the other hand, statements like this strike me as narrow, lacking perspective.  After hiking for months across Southeast Asia, I do hope you have more take away than:<p><i>>These might seem like stupid things to worry about, but when you have trust in everything you own, you dont have to worry about anything. Its liberating and an amazing feeling. My life was markedly better because of it.</i><p>No, what is amazing and liberating is transcending having to trust in things at all because you have such relentless resourcefulness, determination, and physical and mental health that it doesn't matter whether you have every <i>thing</i> you need, you can make do without it.  You can, as the US Marines put it, improvise, adapt, and overcome [2].  You're not dependent in any way on what you own, and as a result, are not owned by it [3].<p>So I think there's a bit of yin/yang here.  Of the stuff you must buy, buy high quality for the long haul, but don't become so attached and emotionally invested that it ends up owning you.<p>[1]:    <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/</a><p>[2]:    <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCYv40Ur1g"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCYv40Ur1g</a><p>[3]:    <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPPvkhGZT7Y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPPvkhGZT7Y</a>",1352332639
4755850,comment,4755470,4755761,4,0,Firehed,,,"> Perfection is meaningless when it comes to material goods. They're always a means to an end.<p>I think he's well aware of that. While some of the examples were kind of strange and materialistic, there's a lot of truth in the concept that some goods are made better than others. When I use cheap goods, I tend to have a poor experience with it and uncertainty about its ability to do its job[1]. Higher-quality stuff (""the best""), for the most part, doesn't have this problem. I can trust that the stuff I'm using will let me get on with my life without getting in my way. It's like reaching into the toolbox and finding the exact tool you need for the job at hand - rather than fighting with something that's kinda-sorta what you need, you can just do what needs to get done. That time I was fixing the shower head and had the pipe tape I needed on-hand and where I expected it to be: it prevented a five-minute job from turning into a two-hour ordeal. I like that.<p>You raise a great point though - a lot of this stuff is not necessary at all. But various situations often beyond our control will always be changing our standards of living.  I think the real take-away is that if you're going to have stuff to improve your life, make sure you're getting stuff good enough that it's actually an improvement.<p>[1] All the electronic crap in bathrooms, like paper towel dispensers and automatic flush toilets. When it works, great - but when it doesn't, you're fighting with inanimate objects that try to re-solve problems we solved centuries ago. #firstworldproblem I know, but I could do without the ""am I going to have to wave my hand in front of the paper towel dispenser for thirty seconds again?"" every time I wash my hands.",1352332604

4755847,comment,4752208,4753049,1,0,DougBTX,,,"> It's hard to quantify just how close he was.<p>It is hard to do with the final, ""chance of winning"" numbers, but it is much easier with his share of the vote predictions, and you can check those predictions for all states that way, even the ones where the winner was certain.<p>Say Nate predicts that candidate A will get 80% of the votes in a particular state, with a margin of error of 2%. Then, after the results are out, if that candidate got 81% of the votes, then it was a good prediction, if they got 90% of the votes, it was a bad prediction.<p>To quantify that, you want to compare the actual error with the predicted error. There are better ways than this, but I'll make one up on the spot: score = 1 / (actual error percentage points * predicted error percentage points). In the first case, the score would be 1 / (1 * 2) = 0.5. In the second, 1 / (10 * 2) = 0.05. The bigger the score, the better the prediction. (This isn't a great model, since it rates a prediction with a large margin of error which happened to be bang on higher than a roughly right prediction with a narrow predicted error, but this is the general idea.)",1352332582

4755845,comment,4755470,4755745,9,0,kstenerud,,,"I didn't get any sense of being defined by it. It's simply knowing that a particular item you own will fulfill most criteria you find important in an item of that type.<p>For example, I own a Solo wood burning stove and an Esbit brass alcohol burner. I spent a few days researching them before my purchase, and I take them with me whenever I go on a multi-day hike. I did the same for everything in my pack. So now, if I ever lose my pack (a distinct possibility), I can build up a replacement and order whatever I need in less than an hour because the hard part (research) has already been done. On top of that, I have the peace of mind in knowing that my tools are unlikely to fail me in my time of need.<p>Of course, I sometimes make bad purchases even after researching, at which point I decide whether to replace it with something else, or accept its deficiencies.<p>It's not about price or status. Some stuff was expensive. Some stuff was very cheap. Some stuff I bought at the Salvation Army store. Some stuff I built myself because the storebought stuff didn't suit my purposes well enough. The cheapest item I own is a deodorant salt crystal that I bought for 89 cents and will last me for years so long as I don't drop and shatter it.<p>It's about choosing where your comfort level is with various ""things"". Sometimes the ""best"" is actually disposable or will break after a few uses.<p>I don't buy things very often, but on the rare occasions that I do, I research carefully first. That's not a definition of me; it's just something I do so that I can know where I stand with respect to the tools and items I use. Everything has a purpose that I can cite instantly, and if I can't, I get rid of it.",1352332516

4755840,comment,4752254,4755355,1,0,smsm42,,,"Compared to enormous costs of the War On Drugs, the cost change would be clearly negative. It is much cheaper to ensure pot is not sold to minors, not distributed in schools, etc. - just as is done with alcohol/tobacco now - that to have dedicated police force, court system and prison system prosecuting marijuana users.<p>Societal costs of DUI would not change much - people that are careless enough to DUI would DUI anyway, and legal pot does not add much to it - whoever needs pot, knows where to get it even illegally, and obviously if he doesn't care about the law while DUI, he wouldn't also care about the law before, while consuming. So while a minor rise in DUI is possible since people that smoked in home because they were afraid to be arrested may now smoke outside and then drive, I think it won't be very significant. Most people know how to be responsible.<p>Rehab costs would rise since more people which have dependency problem would turn to rehab now that they aren't branded criminals anymore, but I think it is a good thing, and the cost will be completely covered by the reduction of costs in policing, courts and prisons. Especially that marijuana is a relatively lightly-addictive drug, so rehab would not be as costly as for heavier substances.",1352332453

4755838,comment,4755421,4755705,3,0,CrankyPants,,,"I've moved to paying for content. In fact, at one point I shut off all content I wasn't directly paying for. A few things happened:<p>The S/N got astonishingly better.<p>The time spent on it was much lower.<p>What I got out of it was more nuanced, and impacted me more deeply.<p>Now, a few other things happened: I missed some things, some of which was good (well-reasoned debates on HN, for example), some of which was the equivalent of junk food (tech news updates), but still not without some utility and applicability.<p>I also decided some of my subscription content really wasn't worth it, because it started to feel an awful lot closer to the ad supported stuff I'd just detox'd off of, than the higher quality stuff I was paying for.<p>I also missed some really, really good 'blogs from people who are respected industry figures, and run the 'blog more to make sure they stay respected industry figures, than to directly profit from them. Those are back in the (much reduced) fray.<p>Which is all to say: I think if we paid directly for the content we consumed on TV, it could work out OK. And, once the industry realizes its model is unsustainable, everything will cost less to produce, and, hopefully, buy. (Think of sending $5-7 to an artist for their album, as opposed to paying $10-15 to pay a lot of guys whose ability to add value is ever declining.) I'd just as soon watch 2-3 really superb TV shows per week and pay $100-300/year than spend that (or more) for the same stuff, plus a whole lot of noise and bloat. I think we'd come out of the other end better for it, and with more to show.<p>At the risk of being hastily axiomatic, I could say that everyone's beholden to someone. Or, at least, content creators who want to be paid for their work, are. I'd rather they be primarily beholden to the customer, than to the advertiser, or the political climate and/or government, etc. Any other arrangement, to me, seems too compromised, if for no other reason than because a direct wallet-vote seems to be the most powerful.",1352332424

One of the Webscript examples shows how to use Amazon's S3 service from Webscript. In building that script, we made use of our Amazon credentials, and we inadvertently published those credentials in the example code. These credentials have already been changed, but there was a window in which the credentials were visible and active.<p>In the future, we will never use Planet Rational's AWS credentials in any examples, and we are adopting a more rigorous checklist-based process to make sure we don't leak any secrets in code examples.<p>We are very sorry for this.

Overthinking this is the enemy.<p><i>figuring out if each thing is worth selling, donating, or throwing away</i><p>You're already overthinking it.  The objective here is to simplify your life, not to maximize your income from the shedding operation or find the most appropriate way to donate something.  If that has a monetary cost in selling something too cheaply or donating something saleable, that's the cost of hoarding things you don't need.<p>First, look around you.  If, for each thing you see, you can't immediately say why you have it, it goes on 'get rid of' list.  This means you'll get rid of something you'll need later on, most likely.  That's okay.  Rebuying something will imprint in your mind why you need that thing.<p>Sell anything obviously saleable and big ticket.  Couch, computer, bike.... anything that can go quickly on Craigslist for a chunk of cash to the first person who says ""I'll take it"".  Price it to move, not to get rich.  Remember the objective.<p>Donate the rest.  Places like the Salvation Army will take a lot of different stuff, and you can just dump it on them.  Googling your local recycling or donation centres will give you some more answers.  Remember the objective.<p>Throw out the rest.  Again, you'll likely find yourself throwing out a lot, and feeling bad about it.  That's good, because the next time you're in a store trying to talk yourself into buying something, you'll think of that huge, wasteful purge, and wonder if this thing you're thinking of buying will be part of the next one.  If it's not immediately obvious why you'll keep it around, don't buy it.<p>Go through a couple cycles like this, and you'll have a lot less stuff around, you'll know why you have the stuff you do, and you'll feel a lot less encumbered by possessions.  Also, remember that this doesn't have to happen all at once.  Every Saturday, find a bunch of things to donate or sell, and do it.  Every Friday night, throw out several things you don't want.  Eventually it becomes a continual, easy pruning process, which is ideal.",1352329755

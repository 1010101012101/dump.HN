I never disagreed on this point. Ideas are important too, but ideas only act as a multiplicator of value, so good execution by itself doesn't provide enough value and ideas without execution are meaningless.<p><pre><code>     What difference does it make? Jobs didn't
     make his name as an engineer
</code></pre>
That's not what matters here, and yes it makes a difference.<p>To be able to come up with ideas, to be able to have a vision, to be able to have taste, to be able to drive a product, you do have to have an educated mind in that domain, you do need to know what is possible, you do need to be able to do the job yourself if you need to, even if you're not that good as an engineer.<p>How can you come up with ideas otherwise? And the proof is simple really. Every great idea that revolutionized our world, from electricity, to personal computers, to the Internet, to search engines, to the smartphone you're carrying, everything has come from minds of individuals that know their basics.<p>Ideas and vision don't come out of thin air. It is often said that a university's purpose shouldn't be to prepare you for real life jobs, but rather to expand your horizons on what's possible and I believe so too.<p>This is why I consider people with MBAs, but with no technical education, to be basically worthless in startups (and I'm not talking about degrees here, self-taught is good enough). So you have an idea, great for you, however you have to prove that either you know what you're talking about, or have a proven track record of successful implementations of your ideas that worked. This attitude is just meritocracy in action.<p>Also, I see a lot of resentment here, with people getting offended by this attitude of programmers towards business-types. But we aren't the ones that started it, it was the business types that wanted to turn us into stupid and replaceable assembly lines. Ask the developers in the games industry how they get treated.

Is that all the value a programmer is? I think not. Higher education teaches you about how computers work. I've taken classes on the fundamentals of computers, from the lowest level (transistors) to writing programs in machine language, assembly & C. I understand how using a set of logically complete instructions, I can build ANY computer system. From there I understand how C, and C++ works and I've gotten massive dose of Java, OOP, Polymorphism, inheritance, abstraction, recursion, memory management, heaps, stack, memory allocation, algorithms, analysis of algorithms, and not to mention 2.5 years of continual programming experience both through academic work and internships. Next semester I'll be learning about Mobile application development, more on C++, Operating Systems, threading and multicore application development. Just a small snapshot of what it takes to become a great programmer.<p>These ""code schools"" are great for one thing. Wasting money. These classes cannot replace the rigor of my education; especially when working 25 hours a week and going to school full-time, taking classes that require minimum 15 hours each of homework outside of class.

In the original exchange the points were brought up.<p>To me, the points were brought up one email too late.  The moment the first response was <i>Josh, let me talk to Tim. After you lost our data and caused our entire company to scramble for 3 days, I am hesitant</i>,<p>I saw this as.  ""Let me think of how I can not pay you.""<p>Even though the next email was perfectly cogent, it wasn't the first.  (The next email read <i>Spoke with Somrat about this.  You're right that the trouble that you caused has nothing to do with a referral bonus. However, we only pay bonuses to employees.  The bonuses are discretionary and not contractual.  You and Miso never signed a contract that mentions bonuses. As a policy, referral bonuses are meant to help build a stronger team based on existing relationships.  Employees bringing on employees that they've worked with in the past builds a stronger team.  This bonus is not simply about hiring.  For example, we don't pay people outside of Miso when they refer us candidates that we hire. Because you are no longer employed by Miso, you are not eligible for this bonus.</i>).<p>After the first email bringing up something irrelevant that I passed summary judgment on Miso: if you don't pay, everything else is irrelevant, no matter what you think of it's just excuses, since your first excuse was to just say, ""Fuck you, I don't need to string you along anymore.  Here's the first thing I could think of.  You dropped a one week old database on a product we didn't have backups on.""  Of COURSE that has nothing to do with a referral, except if you're saying, ""you know I pull the strings around here and it's my decision to make.  I'm not all that happy with you.""<p>Sorry, Miso, you lost in that sentence.  The question is only whether you owe the employee a referral bonus you promised.  You don't get to do what you promised if you had a good experience with the the guy or not otherwise.<p>There's this great founder I always have in mind when I read stuff like this.  Boy did that guy have a philosophy! I've always thought of drawing a caricature of him sitting down at a restaurant with his wife and looking at the menu, and his wife saying that they really can't afford these prices.  So he says, ""It's okay honey order whatever you want.  There is no <i>way</i> I'm paying for any of this shit.""",1336717734

For all intents and purposes, Javascript's so-called prototypes are shitty single-inheritance classes without the sugar.<p>> dynamic function scope (not sure if there's a proper name for this)<p>Not sure what you mean by ""dynamic function scope"", since you don't seem to like `this` (which is indeed complete garbage, but is sorta dynamically scoped) I'm guessing you mean lexical closures?

That's no bloody excuse.<p>[0] in Self, prototypes are just the thing you clone to get a basic object, they're just a template. They're not a unit of code reuse or inheritance: that's the job of mixins[1]<p>[1] which, again, are very different from what you get in JavaScript or Ruby (though Ruby is closer): in Self, a mixin is an object you link to your own via a ""parent slot"", a special type of slot used for message resolution. When a message is sent to an object, the runtime first checks all of the object's non-parent slots and if there's no match it follows the parent slots recursively to try and find a slot matching the message.",1336717228

3957942,comment,3957314,3957828,-4,0,dkokelley,,,"I doubt that. What you perceive as passion, I perceived as whiny. Whiny as in how a 4 year old REALLY wants a toy when his parents won't buy it for him. Is a child throwing a tantrum <i>passionate</i> about that toy? Is that a good thing?<p>Will this potential employee throw a fit when we don't use the libraries he wants? Probably not (like I would assume of most professionals), but this new found infamy would make me as a recruiting company think twice.<p>I think the situation could and should have been resolved in private. I know there are more clarifying emails, but we don't get to see them. If I were considering hiring this guy, I would be much more comfortable if I could see all of the emails with each side clearly stating their case, and then the developer's calm and rational ultimatum to go to the public. Even then, I would (as a potential employer) be even more comforted if the post itself had a calm and rational voice. (I believe the voice is mixed at best.)<p>I base my claim that this could have been resolved in private on the fact that Miso resolved everything so quickly. <i>If the case and ultimatum were clearly communicated</i>, Miso would have been prepared for the negative PR by releasing their version of events. Instead, the company payed up not even 12 hours after the story is published. This leads me to believe that communication was poor between the parties.",1336716411

If you're making money it's natural to hire more workers to increase your profits, even if that means you're making less money per worker. As your workforce gets bigger there's not enough to do on your core product, so you start to branch out... and before you know it you're where Cisco is today. ""economies of scale"" - aka cost synergies - only really become a reason for enlarging companies if you're talking about mergers between mature companies, long past the point where they were really economically productive.<p>Growth seems to be the measure of success, both for investors and entrepreneurs, so I don't see this stopping any time soon. But imagine a world where, once companies got to the 20-50 person stage, they started paying dividends rather than expanding. There are probably other limiting factors, but if everyone was working in such a company and they were as successful as they are now, productivity would skyrocket.",1336716372

3957938,comment,3957258,3957774,2,0,huhtenberg,,,"Really interesting in a geeky kind of way (to which I can relate completely), but practically speaking though - home automation has been around for a long time, and it didn't really go farther than thermostats, motion sensors + lights and security systems (that still need a hook up to the monitoring services to be useful). I remember tinkering with X.10 almost 10 years ago. Nothing much has changed, it's still engineers designing for engineers. Admittedly I haven't closely looked at the scene for a couple of years, but I researched the subject back then and remember seeing no home automation system that was designed with a notion of usability in mind. Lots of options - sure, plenty of buttons - you bet, perhaps a hierarchical menu with the depth of Cameron's dive - oh, that's a deluxe version :) It seemed that whoever designed those systems didn't actually use any of them.<p>(Not to hijack the thread)<p>There shouldn't be a remote, an existing iPhone should suffice. It should know which room I am in, and it should have relevant options based on that. Default to the electrical/heat/blinds and show all outlets and sockets. Allow to switch to other rooms, ideally in form of a floor plan. Make the remote work when I am <i>not</i> at home.<p>Sell this as a kit of sockets, pass-through junctions, wall switches <i>and</i> a small form-factor controller box. Put it all on WiFi, and give me an iPhone app to control the box. Make it easy to pair the box with devices (show a list of available devices and let me claim them). Allow hooking up the box to the Internet service for out-of-house access (charge me for that too, that's a fair deal).<p>Finally, put an effort into <i>designing</i> the UI and all visible physical parts. Not to be Nest-slick, but designed nonetheless. [1] is an example of what is <i>not</i> designed, but engineered. Feel the difference. Go to Europe to get inspired, if needs be.<p>Basically build a system only if you actually have a personal need for it, and not because you have a handful of assorted sensors. And ""they will come"" :)<p>--<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.lutron.com/Products/StandAloneControls/Dimmers-Switches/MaestroDimmerSwitch/Pages/Overview.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lutron.com/Products/StandAloneControls/Dimmers-Sw...</a>",1336716310

Having a technical co-founder that believes in the project and works well with you adds that extra magic to the equation. As is always the case it's about team, team, team and it is difficult to find an outsourcer that will do anything more than exactly what is asked of them (if you are lucky). Sure it can be done, but having someone to question you, and predict problems before they arise is paramount.<p>Also as others have mentioned, it is tough to be agile with a continent and language barrier between you and the tech side of your company.",1336716165

If you want to use my app and are using an old version of IE just download chrome, it's free, otherwise don't use the app.  I have used only Linux for about the last five years but i do test in IE using VirtualBox and the free VHD's provided by Microsoft(thanks guys).<p>I don't mind using the VM approach but the thing that annoys me is the massive size of the VHD files.  My Ubuntu install is only about 3GB but each windows VM is around 16GB - 16GB!!!  Considering I need a separate VM for every version of IE I want to test and I am using 128GB SSD's in my laptop and Desktop most of my disk space is taken up with having VM's to test IE.<p>That being said I think it's worth supporting newer versions of IE but I always display a message to users recommending they get a better browser, I think the more people we can get away from using IE the better because while IE10 might be ok now i just don't trust MS ability to update it in the future and i worry that in 10 years we'll all be bitching about IE10 the way we bitch about IE6 now because millions of users will still be running out of date browsers because of the poor update path for IE.",1336716071

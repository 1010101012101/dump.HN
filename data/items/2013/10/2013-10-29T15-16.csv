It wants to be a real currency.<p>And as long as its price is fluctuating like this, you&#x27;ve got to be kind of crazy to be using it as anything but a novel currency.<p>Buyers have every reason to be hesitant to buy things using Bitcoins because of the possibility that the pizza&#x27;s worth of BTC they could spend today might be worth enough to buy a house in another couple years.  If you had a lottery ticket that you had good reason to believe might be a winner, would you trade it for a pizza?  I sure wouldn&#x27;t.<p>On the other side of things, sellers have rational reasons to not accept BTC out of fear that the company&#x27;s bank account might rapidly diminish in value.<p>The (non-speculative) Bitcoin community is this fascinating caricature of currency situation in old Soviet bloc countries.

6635048,comment,6623830,6623830,2,0,daughart,,,"There is no reproducibility crisis in science.<p>1. Reproducing work is a waste of resources. Use the money and researcher hours to develop tools that are more reliable, cheaper, and easier to use. A major reason why no one reproduces experiments is that the initial work was very difficult. Let&#x27;s invest in technologies that make science easier. Reproduction (of experiments) should be done in high school biology classes.<p>2. Technical reproduction is rarely done, but conceptual reproduction is common. Findings in the literature become incorporated into disparate subsequent hypotheses tested by many other labs. If something doesn&#x27;t add up, this will often increase the impact of the paper and eventually be addressed through experiments to resolve different models of the phenomenon.<p>3. There is no widespread fraud in science. Your academic career rests on your integrity. When I publish a paper, I do my damn best to make sure it is accurate. My reputation relies on it. When scientists continue to publish results that are false or fraudulent, they become discredited within the community. All graduate students in the life sciences are required to take a class on the ethics of science.<p>4. Publishing is a bitch and a source of real rot within the community. Fortunately, many researchers and academics recognize this problem and are addressing it. Look at the new journal eLife, or open access journals, or the increasing interest in arXiv.org (moving to a publishing model closer to that found in math and physics, which appear to be healthier research communities than life sciences). As experiments become more technically advanced, the expectation for methods sections have increased, not decreased.<p>5. People want to commercialize scientific findings that are relatively new - it&#x27;s obvious that is risky! Why put the burden back on (under-funded) scientists? Drug companies are the ones that would benefit financially. Or wait until the phenomenon is better understood. Notice they&#x27;re talking about drugs for complex diseases like cancer, metabolic disorder, etc., not Mendelian diseases. It&#x27;s as if people complained that they couldn&#x27;t get their lasers to work using a 1917 understanding of the physics of light. But Einstein demonstrated the fundamentals!

6634897,comment,6633738,6634109,1,0,drbawb,,,"As far as maintaing cars on a budget goes, I feel I could offer some pointers.
Going by the &quot;$5000&quot; figure I guess I spent about &quot;$2/day per car.&quot; (My yearly maintenance costs are about $1,000 on years when I&#x27;m buying fresh rubber or doing large jobs. Significantly less than that on years that only require servicing consumables like brakes and fluids.)<p>0) Find a reliable car. This seems like a no brainer, but honestly some cars are just _built like tanks._
   This is the toughest part as you&#x27;ll end up spending more money since these cars naturally hold their resale value a bit better.<p><pre><code>   Find something like an older Toyota with an S engine [Camry], or perhaps a Volvo, etc.
   My rule of thumb? If you don&#x27;t get search results for &quot;[Car in question] + 300,000 miles&quot; -- you&#x27;re about to buy the wrong car!

   My Mustang has 300,000mi+ on the clock, my old minivan had 240,000, and it&#x27;s not hard to imagine my Camry making it to 300,000mi
   if I continue to maintain it.
</code></pre>
1) Find an honest mechanic that&#x27;s _willing to install customer supplied parts._
   Sadly: all shops will charge [what I consider] an outrageous markup on parts. This is usually to &quot;subsidize&quot; whatever warranty
   they offer on their work.<p><pre><code>   So be aware that you&#x27;re effectively making a bet that the part you&#x27;re buying isn&#x27;t a dud. Otherwise you&#x27;re going to find out
   why they charge such a ridiculous markup. (Hint: the shop won&#x27;t make you wait 2 weeks while their parts supplier processes the RMA. -- 
   They swap in a brand new part in 24 hours, and hope that the RMA goes through.)
</code></pre>
2) Perform certain maintenance yourself. Here&#x27;s how I see it.<p><pre><code>   * You should be able to: rotate your tires, change your own oil, change air & cabin air filters, check the levels of all other fluids.
   
   * It&#x27;s nice if you can: top off & change other fluids, replace belts, change spark plugs & wires, replace a distributor cap or similar component. (Only applies to older vehicles with a cap or external ignition control module driving the ignition coils. On modern vehicles you&#x27;ll have coil-on-plug fired directly from the ECU.)
   
   * You&#x27;re doing _really well_ if you can: change your own brakes [pads, rotors, drums, and shoes], swap out components on the accessory belt (anything pulley driven, like your pumps, alternator, etc.), replace _any_ suspension or steering components.

</code></pre>
Unless something goes _wrong_, nothing above really requires any specialty tooling. Air tooling is nice, but honestly I&#x27;ve gotten by for years with nothing but an electric impact wrench [for removing & installing wheels]... everything else can be done with a good set of wrenches, a breaker bar, and a dash of blood and tears.<p>(As a precaution: the last category involves some _very dangerous jobs._ -- Improper installation of brakes will at best render your vehicle immobile, at worst it will endanger the safety of yourself and others on the road.<p>As for suspension: those springs support a significant amount of weight. They are _incredibly dangerous_ if not handled properly.)<p>---<p>To elaborate a bit on point #1 we will use a fairly recent example.<p>I had a timing belt installed: I purchased the components [the belt, idler pulleys, water pump, various gaskets] myself for $90.
These components have a 5-year/50,000 mi warranty on the parts themselves.<p>(The shop offered a 2 year / 12,000 mi. warranty for comparison.)<p>The labor comes to $375 because I have a mechanic that will install customer supplied parts. Total I spent: $465 for a job that costs $600-$800 in my area.<p>If you want to know where the extra money comes from: let&#x27;s look at the parts I _didn&#x27;t supply._<p>I needed a thermostat & gasket, a power steering belt, an a serpentine belt. The thermostat and gasket were $25, the belts were $40 a piece, for a total of $105. I could&#x27;ve bought my own thermostat and gasket for $12, and I could&#x27;ve gotten _the same exact belts_ for $9/piece. (A savings of $75 dollars.)<p>At this kind of markup: my timing belt kit would&#x27;ve cost $200+ instead of $90, which falls right in line with the $600-$800 estimate from other shops.<p>If you&#x27;re used to paying for parts through a garage: you&#x27;re probably paying twice as much as you need to for parts.
Finding parts is a cinch: you can either ask your local part store [and then source the parts there, or online] -- or you can use a parts catalog like RockAuto which has their inventory broken down by make, model, year, and engine.
When it comes to car parts: it&#x27;s worth shopping around to save money on shipping; auto parts can get quite heavy, and it makes a huge difference if you can get them shipped from a single warehouse.",1383061117

Language is not a perfect communication tool - you&#x27;ll talk yourself dizzy trying to catch every edge case and possible interpretation.<p>> Every one in this threat seems to be well enough versed on English that a specific language barrier isn&#x27;t an issue, but there are probably people for whom English is a third or forth language: the chance of them seeing as obvious everything that we pick out as obvious is going to be lower than for those with more practise at the language.<p>Great! So we&#x27;re doing them a great service by giving them practice in reading context.<p>> It is not about conviction, it is about accurately displaying the source and potential veracity of the information being presented.<p>Why? This isn&#x27;t an academic discussion. If it looks like you&#x27;re presenting something as a fact and I think you&#x27;re full of shit, I&#x27;ll ask for a clarification. Much like the poster did with the &quot;[citation needed]&quot;. The OP&#x27;s message remains easy to read, and the sub-poster got the clarification they were looking for.<p>> I couch my opinions so it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m stating a commonly known fact instead of something I&#x27;ve supposed. Of course where I&#x27;m pretty damn sure what I&#x27;m stating is verifiable fact I&#x27;ll not bother adding the extra words, but if you always assume you are correct and write in a style that suggests such, then you may be one of those people!
Adding a few extra words to tell the reader this extra information about the (potential) quality of the information you are about to impart is useful IMO. Be as fine grained as you like too: somewhere between &quot;I think that&quot; and &quot;I know&quot; is &quot;It is my understanding that...&quot; and so on.<p>You&#x27;re sacrificing conciseness for a very weak attempt at clarity. It&#x27;s incredibly tedious to read someone&#x27;s opinion piece that says &quot;It&#x27;s my opinion that vaccines are dangerous. I think that X. I believe that Y. I am of the opinion that Z.&quot; It makes your message incredibly boring and unpersuasive.<p>Further, trying to turn this into an academic discussion brings into question all the issues academic discussions engender. How reliable is your source? Have you done the appropriate background reading? If you link a study that says &quot;vaccines are bad&quot; but there are 300 other studies that say &quot;vaccines are good&quot;, are you really being objective?<p>And then of course we can get into some really stupid semantic debates, since we&#x27;re arguing about semantics anyway - what&#x27;s the cutoff?

It will be difficult for any polity to transfer from one corruption regime to another.<p>My theory is that in USA big corruption drives out little corruption. We have the systems in place for massive transfers from the public to the bureaucracy, to government vendors and their lobbyists, to the &quot;elect&quot;. (Which transfers are &quot;leaky&quot;: lots of money is extracted at each step, but there&#x27;s still plenty left over.) Those systems are jealous, and they punish nonconformity. Individuals may only be &quot;entrepreneurial&quot; in approved ways; e.g. cops may not take bribes on the side of the road, but they&#x27;re encouraged to feather their nests through forfeiture and hardball union tactics. Lawmakers can&#x27;t just stuff fat stacks of bribery cash into their refrigerators, but they&#x27;re totally free to sign up for sweetheart &quot;investment&quot; deals. Then again, there is basically nothing that officials at the Treasury Department aren&#x27;t allowed to do. Maybe that&#x27;s the exception that &quot;proves&quot; the rule?<p>The system is &quot;superior&quot; to China&#x27;s, for example, because there the extensive low-level corruption focuses attention on corruption on every level.

The paper is relevant to your interests.<p>&quot;Do empires affect attitudes towards the state long after their demise? We hypothesize that the Habsburg Empire with its localized and well-respected administration increased citizens trust in local public services. In several Eastern European countries, communities on both sides of the long-gone Habsburg border have been sharing common formal institutions for a  century now. Identifying from individuals living within a restricted band around the former border, we find that historical Habsburg affiliation increases current trust and reduces corruption in courts and police. Falsification tests of spuriously moved borders, geographic and pre-existing differences, and interpersonal trust corroborate a genuine Habsburg effect. &quot;<p>--<p>Previous discussion: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2618993"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2618993</a>",1383060205

There&#x27;s also several private colleges in Nashville so that may contribute to higher rental demand as well.<p>Now, I didn&#x27;t do a full ROI on it since I&#x27;m not coming from an investment only perspective and there are certainly other factors but I am including taxes and insurance.<p>You are most certainly correct that buying a house for cash would make sense,  but if that seems like a truly viable option for a younger family then you have lost touch with reality in a big way.<p>Rent&#x27;s like that don&#x27;t seem highly unusual either, there&#x27;s a large swath of people who cannot qualify at the moment but have plenty of monthly cash flow so they are driving rents up. If investors see this and buy in desirable areas, well, that reduces supply as well...<p>Let&#x27;s say you can buy a house and pay $1,500/month (all inclusive). As an investor, you&#x27;ve got to factor in maintenance (say $200 a month to account for large ones and if you have the tenants do the lawn care) and, most likely, a 6-8% property management fee (unless you&#x27;re a big time investor or you treat it like it&#x27;s your job). So, now you need close to $1,800-850 just to break even, let alone make a profit.<p>Rent is already 17-20% higher than buying and the investor still needs a profit, depending on the area and demand that can be pretty steep but should be at least 12-15%, so there you go.<p>EDIT: I should also note that TN is known for it&#x27;s low COL, I can&#x27;t imagine this situation gets too much better in more populated areas.",1383059964

Income disparity: Gov. officials are mostly lower middle class even from Indian standards. So they are probably making a few thousands Rupees which is not quite there with the cost of living there specially in cities. Some people however are so rich that they can easily pay the bribe which gets the job done in no time. Again, there are efforts to bridge this gap but not easy for a country of the size of India. In the US, income disparity b/w rich and poor is not that bad (even though it seems like the gap is increasing b/w the so called super rich and rest)<p>2. Enforcement of law: In India, there is pretty much a law for everything like any other developed country but the enforcement is almost none. So people taking bribes are less scared and more confident that no one is going to do anything. Yes people are trying to fix that but it&#x27;s a long haul.<p>3. Resource availability: Most basic resources like cooking gas etc. are a big pain to get. Lot of smaller cities/towns and villages still rely on getting cooking gas cylinders from the vendors etc as one example. There is no integrated pipeline. Thee is a fight for pretty much everything even when you have the money. It is changing as well but not there yet.<p>4. Mentality: Indians are brought up seeing bribery as part of a life. Most of them don&#x27;t even realize how bad it is until they get exposed to more developed countries like the US etc. So there is this saying &quot;chalta hai&quot; which literally translates to &quot;it&#x27;s ok to do this&quot;.",1383059839

6634707,comment,6632949,6634540,2,0,powatom,,,"> We&#x27;re talking about programming errors. Are you suggesting the solution to human error is to just not make errors??<p>Not at all, I&#x27;m simply suggesting that people take care to acknowledge and operate within the rules of the language. If you&#x27;re making changes to a function signature in JS without assessing the impact for code elsewhere, then you&#x27;re doing a bad job - and that&#x27;s all there is to it. JS allows you to do something which when ignored or fucked up, results in problems. This is not a JSism - this is just the way things work. Every language has &#x27;features&#x27; like this. If you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, then stop doing it. &quot;A bad workman blames his tools&quot; and all that jazz.<p>> Note, of course, that wrong arguments will frequently not arise from a function call you just wrote -- but from changes in the code.<p>So JS has a (potentially) higher maintenance cost. This doesn&#x27;t mean that JS is badly designed - it&#x27;s just a trade-off. Some people don&#x27;t care, others do. Clearly to some people, it&#x27;s an unacceptable cost - but all that means is that those people have a lower tolerance for that kind of thing than others.<p>> Say you merge in a trivial merge of some code, which changed a function&#x27;s signature/parameters. The merge succeeds trivially. Now every single function call is a bug that is not only uncaught by a compiler. It won&#x27;t even necessarily be caught at runtime. Instead, it may escalate to catastrophic, undefined/unexpected behavior.<p>This is just a case for good documentation and release notes. Don&#x27;t merge in changes that you don&#x27;t understand.",1383059702

Government officials offering lucrative contracts/appointments to their friends or to people who bribed them.<p>I am no sociologist, but I can offer hypotheses for the first 2.<p>1. I think relative inequality might have a lot to do with this one. Although inequality is higher in the US than it is in India, people in the lower income bracket are able to afford a relatively decent standard of living. Also most government officials make middle class income. The marginal benefit of a bribe is very low and the marginal risk is very high. In India, some of the lower level civil servants/policemen make below-middle class wages (or maybe middle class by Indian standards.. I don&#x27;t know). The marginal benefit of even a small bribe is very high. The marginal risk (due to factors I can&#x27;t quantify... ie chance of getting caught, consequences, etc) is very low.<p>2. In the United States, a much higher portion of the population pays federal, state, and local taxes. In India only 2% of the population pays taxes. This is not quantified but I have a hypothesis: Countries where most people pay taxes have citizens who expect greater accountability from their elected/appointed officials because it is THEIR money. In India the average voter has no remote reason to demand his/her elected official to be accountable because its not HIS/HER money being wasted.<p>3. This might be the same reason as above. I don&#x27;t really have a hypothesis for this one.<p>Once again, these are just hypotheses that I have.

When an update was ready, their procedure was: downloading all of the files via FTP, downloading a SQL dump, pressing the &quot;update&quot; buttons, looking at the home screen to make sure it loads, updating the excel sheet with the date and install version and moving on to the next site.  They averaged 4 sites per hour. I&#x27;ll let you do the math on how long that took to get through all of their sites.",1383058866

That&#x27;s a 50 mile drive all by itself. I recall when living in SF that the SF tech scene and SV tech scene were eerily separate because of the city/suburb divide. It&#x27;s far from unified.<p>Compare with the tech scene in NYC which is almost entirely based in Manhattan - a 5-mile stretch of it no less (from Bowling Green up to 59th St), that you can traverse by train or cab in a matter of 20-25 minutes.<p>If pure concentration of people/companies is the X-factor, NYC should&#x27;ve trounced California by now :P",1383058820

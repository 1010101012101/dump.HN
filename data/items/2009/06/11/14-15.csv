You'd think the fans would be favoring such an award for Rick, given they were his fans. They were jealous some new groupies would get to him first, likely. But to be such strong fans for Rick 20 years later: indicates added lunancy. Sheesh, you got Rick Rolled and a half: why would you want Astley to receive such an award? I mean back in the day Rick's music was commercially successful, today it's scene style-wise as a caricature to be mocked. Bizarre to the max.",1244732280

652791,comment,651059,651485,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"There's lots of evidence that the best leader usually is the founder. For example, Henry Ford made his company possibly the biggest and best auto-company in the world (especially at the time) because he had a vision and the vision was to make vehicles cheap enough that anyone could have one. He paid workers the equivalent of $105 dollars an hour and sold vehicle the equivalent of $7,000 by the time the Model T was retired.<p>He was then forced to switch to the annual model that other companies were doing, which is currently credited with severely damaging the car industry due to the severe lack of brand cohesion. At the time, everybody knew the Model T was a very sturdy vehicle, but today you've got to rely on a models previous generations. Now car companies are considering Henry Ford's original model, instead of releasing a new model every year, you release a new model say every decade so that it gets progressively cheaper and more reliable. People with less money will buy a reliable model later in the cycle when it's cheaper, where as people with large disposable incomes will quickly switch to the new expensive version, which is evidenced by the iPod phenomena.<p>I have mechanics in my family, in fact my father owned his own shop at one point, and when you hear people discuss vehicles they invariably end up saying things like ""The 92-95 were good cars, but the 96-97 were disasters"". Apple wouldn't have turned the iPod into such a needless necessity by having bad models; the iPod Nano 1G was at serious threat of this with the whole easy screen breaking because they reduced the surface coating too much, however after a bit of a rough start the Nano is now of the same standard as the classic, you don't have to worry about the screen breaking (even though I think they still have to ship with a case because of the EU's 5 year lifetime law for electronic products).<p>The whole founders leaving the company appears to be a Web 2.0 invention. Creators now can get enough buzz about an idea for someone to pick it up and run with it. However, back even twenty years ago if you failed so did your company. IIRC Henry Ford had two failed automotive companies before he started the current company, I believe he also had a third which he used to get majority control of the current company from the shareholders; I believe his second company was a partnership with the Dodge Brothers. The Dodge Brothers Company was sold almost 5 years after their death, by their widows, and it was the biggest monetary transaction in the world, at the time. If Henry Ford had had the buzz around the mass production of the automobile, I doubt his first company would have gone out of business, however I doubt he would have had the knowledge and experience to run the business himself, famously without a single accountant during his lifetime and IIRC the longest period for a large company in the US to not be audited for taxes.",1244731460

Fiat bought them thinking that they can re-tool the assembly lines to make cars and parts for smaller, fuel-efficient cars which will be more popular (see Europe,France,... - people drive those crappy, little 2-cylinder cars everywhere and big trucks and minivans are not even heard of for the typical customer).  Chrysler/Dodge made great changes for their trucks - I own one and it's more reliable than my wife's Honda Minivan, but the company's focus was on large cars, which are not in favor anymore by the general public.  They made a good product and I'm sure that the CEO of GM probably owns and drives GM cars (as well as some luxury cars) on a very regular basis.

Amazon's SLA guarantees 99.95% availability for a region (meaning that if you have 2 instances running in different availability zones, Amazon guarantees that at least one of the instances will be up 99.95% of the time). However, with a 3 hour downtime being their only downtime (so far as I'm aware) in the past year, they're hitting 99.95% uptime <i>within</i> an availability zone.<p>It should be noted that the 365 Main datacenter that hosts (hosted?) Craigslist, Six Apart, Technorati, and a number of high profile web companies had a total failure a while back (<a href=""http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/07/365-main-datace.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/07/365-main-datace.ht...</a>).  Similarly, Rackspace (whose business is not having to worry about your servers) had 3 outages in 2 days (<a href=""http://gawker.com/tech/followup/rackspace-outage-was-third-in-two-days-321909.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gawker.com/tech/followup/rackspace-outage-was-third-i...</a>).<p>So, Amazon's 3 hour outage that affected a minority of their customers doesn't seem that outrageous.  You're totally right.  The author was probably writing a bit of link-bait to get read.  No one reads ""Amazon EC2 has minor outage that compares favorably against their competitors and affected a minority of their customers.""  That's just business-as-usual talk.  However, if you question the entire viability of cloud computing because of a 3 hour outage, well, that deserves reading.",1244729550

I work as a programmer (and have done so for more than a few years) and am only going to school to ""get my degree"". Nothing is more frustrating to me than when people who have spent their whole careers in academia correct me on dumb things. I once got marked down because my curly braces were on the same line as the function definition in Java. They said it wasn't ""the way it was done in the industry"". I learn 10 times more from my job than I ever have at school - their students would be far better off if their projects were more realistic, and if their teachers had real experience.",1244729483

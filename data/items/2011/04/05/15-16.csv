Jobs arranged a supply of about $40 worth of parts and Wozniak took about four hours to wire a box which was then sold for about $150. To cut down on time it took to build boxes the pair decided to stop wiring the boxes by hand and to have a printed circuit board made. Instead of spending four hours wiring a box, Wozniak could now finish a box within an hour. He also added another feature that turned one button into an automatic dialer. A small speaker and battery were attached to the printed circuit board, a keypad glued to the lid, and when all was finished, <i>a card bearing a message in purple felt pen was taped to the bottom. It read ""He's got the whole world in his hand"" and it was linked to an informal guarantee. Wozniak promised that if a faulty box was returned and still contained the card he would repair it free of charge.</i>""",1302019159

I keep going back and looking at Engine Yard Hoping there will be something there for me but I just can't justify moving from Heroku for the ruby stuff. They have so many knobs to turn and a nice low entry point for very small apps that can be cranked up easily. It's this low barrier to entry that Engine Yard is missing and free for three weeks is not a substitute for this.<p>AppCloud seems to be (and I hate to use this word) ""just"" a thin wrapper around EC2. At least I get that impression looking at the price points - the smallest 32bit instance is just shy of 1k/year. Am I going to get more performance out of three Dynos at Heroku for about the same cost? Maybe maybe not. But where am I going to put my staging test/servers? On a 20/month VPS? On an instance @AppCloud that I spin up and down? No, I'll tell you where, I'm going to stick it on a Dyno or two at Heroku and not worry about it. And then when I need to scale or the product is ready for production where is it going to be hosted. That's right - the same place it's been validated and tested on.<p>By the way, Engine Yard is not the only place that has this barrier to entry problem. Most of the cloud providers do. Joyent.com, Media Temple, Rackspace cloud all have Barriers whether it's poor documentation, higher than normal base costs and bandwidth fees or just inconvenience like having to wait on a call from someone in Texas in order to be allowed to create instances.<p>If the other players want to compete with Heroku on the service and ease of use side or Amazon on flexibility and scale then they are going to have to do much, much, much better.",1302017507

It brings to my mind the line from the musical Man of La Mancha where the question is posited ""Why are you poets so fascinated with mad men?"" To which the answer resounds ""We have much in common"" the continuation describing a core commonality is that both poets and mad men ""select from life""<p>An alternate iteration that I think better links the 'bootstrappers' from the 'beggers' is that they both execute selectively in life.<p>To illustrate I like what pg says about the reason for desiring to condense life's labors into a bitterly and ultra concentrated decade or less.<p>The answer, of course, is not inherently (nor do I think even likely in the case of many) the desire for money but rather the desire to execute on the remainder of life without having to sacrifice any more of it than necesary to money and it's trappings.<p>So if life is the value what I think those hyperly set on the concept of 'just do it' might consider is that virtually all are presently JUST DOING IT.<p>What I mean to say is that life (at least in my case) offers up chances that, whether or not you've landed the fiscal or professional  fruits of a bootstrapped dream, you would be a fool to let pass.<p>Yet often such opportunities have strings that provide added obstacles to that bootstrapping dream come true in the realm of dollars or professional achievement - yet the very reason one seeks the prize is simply to augment or better facilitate those that are the actual life sought.<p>So while I'm all for finishing things. For launching, shipping and generally executing. I think it important to remember that the very reason many 'panhandle' their ideas is because they have already started bootstrapping other aspects of their lives yet cling to the opportunism and the exploitation of happy breaks as much as any real entrepreneur/founder deserving of the title 'relentlessly resourceful' must.<p>Just consider that in a way the ' panhandling' of the idea IS them doing something.<p>Not all Bootstrappers are successful in every aspect.

2411206,comment,2409042,2409042,2,0,rosenjon,,,"I agree with this perspective. For example, I was interested in watching the movie E-Dreams the other day. I would have been more than willing to rent it on Amazon On-Demand, or iTunes, if it was available. However, it wasn't. And then I realized that it was on YouTube. So I just watched it there.<p>I don't mind paying $5 to rent a movie that I want to see. The fact is I don't have enough time in my life to watch all the stuff I want to watch, so when it comes down to it, I simply want the most convenient method of watching something. I'd prefer it not be shot with an unsteady handycam in a movie theater in Brazil with subtitles; I will pay to make sure the version I watch is of decent quality.<p>The fact is that the media industry is so busy trying to put out what it sees as fires (and these piracy fires are endless, by the way), instead of giving the consumer what they want. If they even had the smallest inkling of a brain, they would have already put their entire catalog online for direct purchase. No retarded DRM, or anything like that. Simply let people download the songs, at high quality, and then go after the most egregious forms of piracy. This would lead to higher margins (sales costs effectively go to 0), and they would be able to chill out a bit as well. Instead, they seem to think that living in their bunker somewhere is the way out of the situation, and are passing on probably the greatest revenue opportunity of all time.",1302016078

2411179,comment,2402730,2403132,1,0,hackerblues,,,"""I think that part of the problem is that there's inflation in upvotes because people have an unlimited supply.""<p>It's not obvious to me that this is true. Here is a counterexample:<p>In the extreme case, if the user base consisted of a set of 'wise old users' who only up voted the 'good' content and a set of 'mindless new users' who literally up voted every post, then the votes from the latter group just add to the baseline vote count without having any power at changing the orderings of submissions. In this situation the submission ranking is determined solely by the 'wise old users' even if they are greatly outnumbered.<p>~~~~<p>The problem you describe is that the new people are interested in different things to the old and can use their number advantage to push things in that direction.<p>It seems to me that there are a few possible solutions.<p>1. a) Restrict the topics of discussion on the website by restricting the people who can add to the conversation. Eg, disallowing new accounts to be created or starting a new website and only selectively inviting people.<p>1. b) Restricting the topics of discussion on the website by empowering a certain subgroup of people who share a particular interest. This could be done by moderators deleting submissions or via your suggestion of having 'super votes'.<p>2. a) Allow free submission of topics but provide manual mechanisms for organising the information better so people can choose the subset that they are interested in. Eg, the subreddit approach or having comments marked as insightful/funny/etc.<p>2. b) Allow free submission of topics but provide personalised rankings tailored to each user. Eg, user rlpb tends to like posts which RiderOfGiraffes likes and also posts which include the word ""thinking"" so give those a bonus in the rlpb ranking.<p>In my opinion the ideal solution is 2.b. I dislike the 'elitist' philosophy of 1.a and b, they seem unworkable as long term solutions and pragmatically if I can find the information useful to me on pages 1 and 2 I don't care if pages 3-100 are junk.<p>Option 2.a seems to work ok on Reddit. However, it does rely on people playing by the rules and probably also a willingness to subdivide subdivisions quite liberally.<p>I'm sure there are problems with 2.b as well: people need to be actively providing information about their interests to get the classification benefit, and the computational load is likely higher.<p>tldr: The premise of any vote based ranking site is that there is one set of universally accepted 'good content.' The success of this mechanism depends crucially on the homogeneity of the population it is applied to. If this assumption is broken it can be re-established by exiling part of the population or segregating the population into more homogeneous subgroups (explicitly or invisibly.)",1302015600

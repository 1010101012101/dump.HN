Since SHRDLU's world is so limited, Winograd was able to explicitly program every facet of its language understanding. Unsurprisingly, this approach is totally not scalable and this reveals a little about why we don't have fully human-like language programs.",1368122388

Imagine working on an airplane engine and having the manual right in front of you or using it to photograph and catalog new species during a deep-sea diving expedition.<p>Imagine being someone who has to fix his sink, so he has to bust out a manual and figure out the sink at the same time... oh wait, turns out this nugget doesn't only apply to professional contexts.<p>Consumer-applications  not just playing casual games and updating social media about what you had for dinner.<p>I can see Glass being excellent for some things, while maybe not being ideal for most of the things that you do. Imagine that you are in a foreign country and don't speak the language and you want to talk to someone; do you bust out your smart phone and let the other person spell out the words, then have them played back to you or you read it yourself? Or do you simply talk to that person and see the subtitles pop up as you go? The latter one is clearly superior, IMO.<p>This is like a review of cellphones from the 80's, ""Stuff like this will never be used by anyone else than really busy professionals. It doesn't even fit in your pocket!""<p>EDIT: A lot of the time I really only need my smart phone for special purposes.

The Tesla approach seems great if your only use case is up to 100 mile drives from home to somewhere else and back again the same day to a home where you can easily plug the car in (essentially the typical car commuter). That's got to be a reasonable market now, but I remember seeing a recent article about a strong trend (in younger generations) towards living close to work and not driving or at least driving much less. I definitely fall into that category, and while I do have a car, I only use it on weekends to take trips out of town -- generally to places out in the woods where there will never be charging stations and often far enough that I wouldn't trust a 200 mile range. Unless battery technology gets way better, I just don't see electric-only working for that kind of use case. The Volt makes a lot more sense to me since you always have a backup plan.<p>Regarding charging stations for urban dwellers, my building (like many new projects in the Seattle area, as I understand it) has a few parking spots that are with charging stations. I don't see them in use now, but if electric cars actually do take off, people are going to be fighting over those few spots.",1368121442

The famous detective states that if you eliminate everything that is impossible, whatever remains is true, even if it sounds improbable.<p>All the people who use this law do so because their work is about some kind of model, which can be wholly known. However, if you have a misfortune of working in the real world - like nearly everyone - then you can't apply this law. This means that you won't ever get a proof in a mathematical sense. You won't ever be completely certain - you can be convinced beyond reasonable doubt, but that's all.<p>So when we talk about how biologists are just grant hunters because someone couldn't reproduce their experiments we need to take this into account.

And you <i>can't</i> have some third party do that part for you without trusting them, and the whole idea is not to have to trust any third parties. What public servers are you going to use here? Does each email user have to run their own server? Unless you have a single central server, how do you know which server corresponds to which user?<p>Automating web of trust could be interesting though. Imagine you get an email from a new user that you've never received any email from before. There is some new P2P network where if you have someone's public key, you ask <i>that user</i> whether they know the new user's public key, and they send back a signed response (either ""this is the key I have"" or ""I don't have a key"", signed either way with the known user's public key). Then if all your friends who have the new user's key agree on what it is, it's probably right. If nobody has it, you get encouraged to verify it manually (i.e. in person). And if they don't all agree you get the nasty warnings about something fishy going on.<p>>imagine a virus that automatically generates and adds a PGP key to mail clients before sending to everyone in the address book, just to make it more likely to pass spam filters<p>That seems like a low-effectiveness method of sending spam, given that the public key is uniquely identifying and tied to a sender address, so once the spam filter realizes everyone is marking all those messages as spam it can just blacklist everything sent using that key. Also, how is it different from existing PGP other than that more people would be using it? If you've infected a machine with a virus you can do whatever you want to it. You could just write the spam directly to the user's inbox, or send it out from their own address and sign it with their actual key. Compromised machine = you're screwed.<p>>the accompanying glut of horrible passwords used (or duplication from easily gleaned passwords)<p>This isn't even necessary for a virus.

Satoshi expressed very similar sentiments. Nobody is against alternative implementations.
> What some people, especially Satoshi, have said is that theres an unusual amount of risk involved with reimplementing the full system and using that reimplementation to mine. Bitcoin is very complex and if you arent skilled and very thorough you are likely to diverge from its behavior in small, hard to detect ways. This can fork the chain and split the economy. Its one of the few things that could instantly kill Bitcoin beyond legal harassment of its users.<p>- Mike Hearn 2011<p>>  part of the solution is to encourage alternative implementations that make different trust/convenience tradeoffs than the reference implementation. There has been a lot of behind-the-scenes work on cross-implementation testing (the testnet3 blockchain contains hundreds of transaction validation test cases, for example), and new features are being added to the protocol to support alternative implementations<p>-Gavin Andresen, late 2012<p>If you're not mining, I personally would say it can only be good if you just follow the protocol spec and try to implement Bitcoin from there. If you fall off the main chain and it's not obviously your fault, then either the protocol spec was unclear and can get improved or the original client has a bug, in which case there are ways to carefully phase the bug out of existence with a patch.",1368120565

You should watch some Elon Musk documentaries, to see how many times he was close to bankruptcy, not just of the business, but personal, too - all while running a rocket company, too.

The existing market can recognize these facts well in advance, but when the time comes to switch technologies finds upstart incumbents using the new technology with a cost structure the established companies cannot match.<p>Electric cars qualify because they do not at the same price have the same range, acceleration, or refuel time as gasoline cars.  But all three aspects are improving exponentially over time.  On current trends, electric cars will be comparable to or better than gasoline cars on all three metrics within 20 years.<p>What Elon has done is realized that the cost difference between building a top end car and a bottom end car is not that great, and at the price of a top end car he can deliver equivalent to better acceleration and range, with recharge time that is acceptable to many.  This is very unusual - normally the upstarts in a disruptive market start at the bottom of the market and move up.  (Indeed that was the pattern that Christensen predicted for electric cars.)  But the mechanics work the same way.  By the time Tesla can deliver a mass market car at a mass market price, the incumbents won't have the technology or business structure to deliver a competitive car at a competitive price.<p>For all of the reasons why existing companies will not be able to modify their technology and business structure to what is needed to compete with Tesla, I highly recommend Clayton's followup book, <i>The Innovator's Solution</i>.",1368120319

For this approach to work, you need to be able to split meaningful projects into still somewhat meaningful, fun enough but small subprojects.<p>Another thing is that for many projects you're starting it understanding that you won't finish it - in one piece of time. You're going to start, progress, reflect on it, do some more - then put it on the shelf for a while. And this is ok. This allows you to actually boldly start projects which you know you won't finish - again, in one chunk. For example, I also took several courses on Coursera etc. and dropped then after a couple of weeks. But they are still high in my priorities - as soon as I can/want/return to the same subject of interest, I come back to the courses, reading the material, watching videos and even doing homework. This at least allows me, when taking that course second time (if I need to - usually I don't, the primary reason is knowledge, not the certificate) to feel right at home.<p>I'd say, don't throw away that list of ideas you developed while working on something - but check it, choose perhaps something out of it for the new list, may be you're still interested in some projects mentioned there.<p>And... you still have to be persistent at times. Don't worry - it's a source of great feeling when you actually finish something non-trivial - and only you know how hard it was, and you really learned things from that - and you know you're better because of that.",1368120042

One thought I had is an ""allocate 20 points"" system. You don't actually have to prove anything because resumes suck at that, but if you put ""Machine Learning: 7"" that shows that you view yourself as being ""35%"" Machine Learning and are fairly comfortable discussing it on an interview.<p>This leads to the concept of a scarce graph, which is weighted but also imposes granularity (e.g. 20-point limit with 1-point minimum units) to prevent sprawl, and forces people to prioritize. Running graph algorithms against scarce graphs, with data pertaining to peoples' desires for connection (new jobs, new candidates) could be interesting.<p>So there's that. You get as much <i>legitimate</i> information out of a 20-point allocation of interests and experience as you would out of a resume or a job posting. What you don't get is the social status bullshit (dates and titles).<p>Ok, onto fixing the labor market in general, I think the best solution I can come up with is to build this: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/05/07/fixing-employment-with-consulting-call-options/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/05/07/fixing-employ...</a><p>That's Part I. Part II comes from the fact that, if Part I is build, people are going to want to get better, fast, at marketing themselves so their call options trade at a higher rate. That leads naturally into career coaching (a better model than traditional recruiting) but also into objective evaluation of, for example, source code quality. Now we can actually verify that, yes, John is a top-notch programmer and his $200/hr-struck call options actually aren't out of the money.<p>Part III would be to use all the professional development data thus gathered and start scoring employers based on how much value they add to peoples' careers. How fast does a typical person grow, as a programmer, after 2 years at Google? What does it do for that person's employment potential 10 years down the road?

What is ""pure boolean logic"" anyway? It doesn't exist even at the lowest levels. Logic is always applied to a statement of some kind, it doesn't exist as a pure abstraction. It's interesting you bring up Godel. Russell and Whitehead attempted to map logic to math in the Principia, and were refuted by Godel's incompleteness. I don't want to make too much of incompleteness (as many do), but let's not make too little of it either. At some point logic can only do so much for you, and you have to resort to analogy. I think this happens much earlier in CPU architecture than you're allowing for.<p>What you have at a low level on the CPU are a set of instructions arbitrarily (to some degree) defined to efficiently model analogical actions like ""push"" and ""move"" and ""shift"" and the fundamental operations that map to assembly. And here we've already moved out of the realm of pure logic -> math envisioned by Russell and we've created logic -> language, by way of analogy. This is, I would argue, a rhetorical move rather than a logical one.

The Mercedes SLS Electric Drive came out a few months ago, I believe, and it's a work of engineering and art.<p>But Ford isn't Mercedes, and they can't afford to switch up their assembly processes because then it would drive up the prices of the cars they sell, which defeats the point of Ford -- affordable, reliable transportation. Remove the affordable, because the cost of manufacture goes up immensely, and the reliability goes down. Electric automobiles are still experimental technology, albeit very mature experimental technology. Imagine them as Debian testing installs that are very stable, but still aren't as stable as Debian stable installs (the gasoline-powered vehicles).<p>It will take time, but it will also take game-changers like Tesla for electric cars to go mainstream.",1368118870

That's rather subjective, and as others have pointed out, all social networks do the same.<p>What's most relevant here is that it's downright illegal in most Western countries LinkedIn e.a. operate in. Both collecting this information and sharing it without explicit (as in: not just default checked boxes) informed (as in: information about why, what and shared with whom) consent is not just unethical, it's a violation of most known privacy laws.<p>The widespread practice of blatantly unethical business practices in our industry by both high profile companies and small start-ups alike is something we as professionals should take more seriously.<p>If we don't, it doesn't only harm the image of our industry, but we'll be faced with ever more regulatory hurdles. The infamous EU cookie law is just the beginning if we don't act to clean up our own industry.<p>Every second web company seems to have a business model that directly or indirectly generates revenue through stalking people on a massive scale.

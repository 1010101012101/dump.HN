Power generation requires a power plant, while heat pumps can work extremely efficiently on a building-by-building basis.  Heat pumps are great, but can&#x27;t power a city.  For that you need geothermal, which generally means &#x27;hydrothermal&#x27; because they all use steam to turn turbines (or to heat other fluids that turn turbines).<p>Basically, you&#x27;re right about the limiting factor being that it&#x27;s expensive to drill deep holes.  The heat distribution in the earth&#x27;s crust is highly variable, so geothermal is more favorable where the crust is hot, because you don&#x27;t have to drill as deeply (and install and operate equipment at great pressures).  In a favorable area, such as near active volcanoes or large hot springs, geothermal may be a viable choice if the area is available for drilling (i.e. not in a national park) and close to a metro area or other high-capacity electrical grid.<p>When all of these factors work out, geothermal is great.  The Geysers north of San Francisco has a capacity of about 725 MW[0], and basically powers SF.  It loses ~1% production annually, though, because the hot water powering the plant becomes extracted, and cold water pumped in cools the rocks slightly.  Note that the rocks will re-heat themselves, but it takes time.<p>However, it doesn&#x27;t always work out.  Much of the hot crust in the US is in Nevada and Idaho, where there are very few people, and not a lot of groundwater. Colder crust has the hot water too, but it&#x27;s at great depths (e.g. 3-4 km) which would cost maybe 50-100 million USD to drill to.  (A recent temperature test well--not production--well near me cost $3MM to drill ~1000 feet, and it gets exponentially more expensive with depth.  The well, located by a small hot spring not far from Seattle, had a temperature inversion and turned colder with depth, so the money went down the drain).<p>I do some consulting work for a company[1] that is experimenting with a technique called &#x27;Enhanced Geothermal&#x27; or EGS that tries to exploit hot, dry rock by pumping cold water in through an injection well and pumping now-hot water back out at a nearby production well.  This opens up a lot more exploitable ground[2] but is still very expensive and not yet proven for production.  A test is in progress at Newberry volcano in Oregon[3].<p>However, I have high hopes for geothermal longer-term.  I think that the drilling costs may get a bit lower, especially as a lot of the technology is developed by oil and gas companies (and associated drilling companies that are now or soon to be out of work, with current low oil prices).  Additionally, once EGS is more proven and therefore less risky, investors will be willing to put money in.  I don&#x27;t know if it will ever as profitable as fossil fuels, but once the geological and technological uncertainties are lowered, then it should start to become a great, fairly safe investment (i.e. the demand for electricity is unlikely to drop down much).<p>[0]: <a href=""http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2011/ph240/halasz1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2011/ph240/halasz1/</a>\n[1]: <a href=""http://altarockenergy.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://altarockenergy.com</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://www.nrel.gov/gis/images/geothermal_resource2009-final.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nrel.gov/gis/images/geothermal_resource2009-final...</a>\n[3]: <a href=""http://blog.newberrygeothermal.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.newberrygeothermal.com/</a>",1453417192

Relatively small groups of immigrants are able to integrate into this culture seamlessly.<p>Black people in England aren&#x27;t culturally &quot;Black&quot;, they are either culturally English, or culturally Trinidadan, Jamaican, Ugandan, and so on. Or some combination/superposition of the above.<p>There is no particularly strong shared experience between a Trinidadan-English person and a Zimbabwean-English person other than living in England.<p>Blacks in the US, on the other hand, have a common and separate culture. 20th century immigrants are a tiny proportion of the (biologically) Black population of the US. The overwhelming majority of US black people are descended from slaves.<p>This population has been separated from the white population to varying degrees from the time of slavery to the present day. Now there is more mixing so the cultures are converging, but that can&#x27;t happen overnight.<p>You may as well ask why Scotland and England have separate cultures, or England and China. It&#x27;s not a matter of skin color; it&#x27;s a matter of a group of people that have primarily had contact with each other, and less contact with other groups, for hundreds of years. I am not sure how else to explain it.<p>Edit: re-reading your comment. I didn&#x27;t realize you were asking about communication difficulties specifically. This can probably be largely explained by the fact that African-Americans speak their own dialect of English that is in some ways quite dramatically different from the (White) standard.

In order to get an EV cert, you must pass those requirements, specifically:<p>- government information sources<p>- qualified independent information sources<p>- all domain names must be inspected by a human<p>- phone calls to your office<p>Additionally Google mandates Certificate Transparency for EV, so all EV certs have CT as a result.<p>EV is also required for .onion services, because what would be the point of anonymity unless you actually knew who you were talking to.<p>In the 90s it took a long a long time for certs to be issued: you&#x27;d fax ID to VeriSign, they&#x27;d verify your identity and sign your certificate.<p>DV was introduced by  Geotrust as a way of saving money for CAs: DV just means you can register a domain: even if the domain seems like it belongs to a particular legal entity, DV makes no assurances that it does. People can and do get DV certs that seem like they&#x27;re for major companies all the time.

EV isn&#x27;t perfect: you could attempt to be verified as another company. However it is the only type of certificate that assures an actual identity to browsers.<p>Disclaimer: I work for a startup that&#x27;s created significantly faster, more painless EV validation.

You find people that work/worked in Twitter, that tell you that anything that Typesafe, the company that does most of the development of the language, is not worth using: They have their own stack for everything. Then, you have the Scalaz tribe: They also dislike the standard library, along with the Twitter libraries. And now we have TypeLevel, which splinters from the scalaz group. You don&#x27;t have one camp: you at least have three or four, and having talked to prominent members of each of those subcultures, good luck ever getting them to try to unify anything: There is much intra tribe hate in public, and it gets even nastier when they are in private.<p>Having worked with people from each tribe at one point or another, I think that the situation is pretty hopeless, and the community knows it. The best way for Scala programmers to bond is to hate on a tribe that neither of them belongs to!<p>Just look at the two keynotes in Scala exchange 2015: One by Jessica Kerr, the other by Miles Sabin. Two people that come from very different backgrounds, writing very different code (business scala vs shapeless).

It means less common than the scenario being compared with. If lone commuting is 51% of driving, and multi-passenger is 49% of driving, it would not be inaccurate to say that multi-passenger driving is relatively rare when compared to lone commuting. I am not saying that multi-passenger trips rarely happen.<p>To reiterate, I am saying that more miles are driven single passenger (excluding hired drivers) than multi-passenger, and that is the only claim that I am making on the subject.<p>I trust we have that cleared up now. It means that once it makes sense to have driverless car fleets chauffeuring people around in cities, it will likely make economic sense to make a lot of those vehicles single passenger, because they can be made much more cheaply and run more efficiently. This is not really possible with the current consumer car industry, because consumers want the capability to drive more than one person (whether they have kids or not), even if most of the driving they do is alone. Likewise taxis are always moving at minimum two people when it&#x27;s making money.<p>And I don&#x27;t see any reason there wouldn&#x27;t still be plentiful multi-passenger cars. I&#x27;m not trying to banish multi-passenger car trips from society. I&#x27;m not against them! They are just currently &quot;relatively rare&quot; in practice. I could see electric cars potentially increasing adult carpooling, or reducing it. For instance, maybe a car service has a fleet of minvans, and offers discount rates, but fills itself to capacity on the way to your general destination. Or maybe carpooling among adults with different starting and ending points ultimately essentially goes away, like if tiny single passenger driverless vehicles in constant use end up being more efficient than carpooling once all the numbers are in. Even in that case there would still be multi-passenger cars, because there are always going to be people who want to go on dates, or out with friends, adults that need to accompany kids and any number of other reasons that people choose to travel together. Driverless cars don&#x27;t get rid of the need for multi-passenger cars. They get rid of the incentives that cause people to waste full size cars on one person trips. They unlock the potential for cars to further specialize to improve efficiency.<p>A consumer car needs to be multi-passenger. A driverless fleet car doesn&#x27;t. It makes sense then that the fleets that service a given area would tend to try to balance the number of single passenger and multi-passenger vehicles in their fleet to match the demand for these two types of trips. That&#x27;s really all I&#x27;m getting at with this line of thought. I&#x27;m not making a strong statement about the single vs multi-passenger composition of trips.",1453416060

What is your evidence that IQ tests are poor proxies in the case of testing African-Americans?<p>A great deal of data seems to show that IQ still is very predictive, even when accounting for socio-economic status. That is exactly what they were originally designed for.

Instead for at least hundreds of thousands of years to the present and the foreseeable future, essentially the main cause of climate change is just the level of solar activity.  As that varies so does the rate of sun spots, the strength of the solar wind, the rate at which the solar wind blocks cosmic rays, cosmic rays hit water molecules in the atmosphere, water droplets are formed, clouds are formed.  More clouds have a cooling effect.  So, a more active sun blocks more cosmic rays, causes fewer clouds, and warms the earth.  A less active sun, ..., more clouds, and a cooler earth.<p>CO2 levels don&#x27;t fit the temperature data at all well, e.g., in the Vostok data Gore&#x27;s movie used, the CO2 levels went up about 800 years after the temperature went up.  E.g., the cooling from The Little Ice Age was not from less CO2 but from a very inactive sun.  The increase in temperature coming out of The Little Ice Age was from a more active sun.  The global cooling from about 1950 to 1980 was from an inactive sun while CO2 levels increased.<p>Net, CO2 is irrelevant.  The cause is the activity level of the sun.  Burn all the fossil fuels you want.<p>Solar?  Maybe can find a use for it:  E.g., maybe in desert areas, smelt aluminum, desalinate water and use it in greenhouses, convert water and coal to gasoline.  A key to such desert applications is don&#x27;t need to store the electric energy from the solar panels -- instead, just smelt aluminum, the clean water, or gasoline when the sun shines and store that.<p>Solar for the US electric grid?

E.g., you and Bill Gates might be very happy to watch the BBC<p><i>The Great Global Warming Swindle</i><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52Mx0_8YEtg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52Mx0_8YEtg</a><p>Thumbnail version:  Human sources of CO2 have nothing to do with climate.  Instead for at least hundreds of thousands of years to the present and the foreseeable future, essentially the main cause of climate change is just the level of solar activity.  As that varies so does the rate of sun spots, the strength of the solar wind, the rate at which the solar wind blocks cosmic rays, cosmic rays hit water molecules in the atmosphere, water droplets are formed, clouds are formed.  More clouds have a cooling effect.  So, a more active sun blocks more cosmic rays, causes fewer clouds, and warms the earth.  A less active sun, ..., more clouds, and a cooler earth.<p>CO2 levels don&#x27;t fit the temperature data at all well, e.g., in the Vostok data Gore&#x27;s movie used, the CO2 levels went up about 800 years after the temperature went up.  E.g., the cooling from The Little Ice Age was not from less CO2 but from a very inactive sun.  The increase in temperature coming out of The Little Ice Age was from a more active sun.  The global cooling from about 1950 to 1980 was from an inactive sun while CO2 levels increased.<p>Net, CO2 is irrelevant.  The cause is the activity level of the sun.  Burn all the fossil fuels you want.<p>Solar?  Maybe can find a use for it:  E.g., maybe in desert areas, smelt aluminum, desalinate water and use it in greenhouses, convert water and coal to gasoline.  A key to such desert applications is don&#x27;t need to store the electric energy from the solar panels -- instead, just make the clean water or gasoline when the sun shines and store that.<p>Solar for the US electric grid?  Nope:  Need storage, and it alone is more expensive than the alternatives so that for the grid solar is not wanted even for free.",1453415689

Atm the money is with corporations.  They don&#x27;t actually want it.  They would rather have customers buying their products than money sitting in a box.  The role of government in resolving this impasse is to somehow make that parked money move again.  Either take it via taxes (very difficult as the US does not generally tax assets) or get the corporations to spent it willingly.<p>I&#x27;d vote for a rule that would mandate dividend payouts by corporations that hoard money.  Define a fixed amount that is acceptable, say 25% of net worth, and any liquid assets above that number must be paid as dividends.  That will move a pile of money from corporations to wealthy stockholders, which in turn pay taxes and hopefully will spend some on products.  Yes, it is a &quot;trickle-down&quot; approach, but I think that is the only approach the US electorate can stomach these days.  Or, to avoid paying said dividends, corporations would invest in/hire people who would then pay taxes and otherwise keep the money flowing through the economy.",1453415671

10948965,comment,10940455,10948102,0,0,jmorrow977,,,"I&#x27;m coming around to the opinion that taxes on income are a bad idea.  Income flows to people as they&#x27;re trying to accumulate wealth, trying to climb from lower to middle to upper class.  Higher taxes on income, especially highly progressive taxes, make it harder for people to move between social classes.<p>The focus on income tax creates a situation where the person who makes $200k/yr but has a net worth of $0 gets taxed far more than the person whose investments bring them $100k/yr and they have a net worth of $2,500,000.<p>Oh, and their lifestyle might be about the same despite the disparity in income, because one of them needs to work for a living so they&#x27;ll need to live somewhere close to jobs, pay more for transportation, etc.<p>Higher income tax is great, if you&#x27;re already wealthy.  If I was wealthy, I&#x27;d be very happy people if stay focused on that.  But I think taxing accumulated wealth is a much better way of leveling the playing field over time and also making sure capital stays in productive use.  France already has something like a 0.5-1% &quot;solidarity tax&quot; on wealth, and it&#x27;s a progressive tax.<p>According to Piketty, the return on capital has historically been around 5% per year, and returns are better at scale.  For multi-billion dollar funds, the rates are around 9-10%.  The &quot;Financial Independence/ Retire Early&quot; people who plan for pessimistic scenarios say to expect 4% return.  Let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s reliable to expect 2-3%.<p>At $10M a person can expect about $200-300k in income.  If we have a wealth tax of 1% their investment income after taxes reduces to $100-200k.  If they want to maintain their previous standard of living, they need to make about $100k per year.<p>At $100M let&#x27;s say economies of scale start to happen and even in a pessimistic scenario you can expect a 4% return.  If we have a 2% wealth tax at this point, the person can still expect an investment-only income of $2M per year.<p>You can see where this is going.  At $1B with a 5% pessimistic return, 3% wealth tax, $20M investment income.  At $10B with a 6% pessimistic return, 4% wealth tax, $200M investment income.<p>The nice side effect of this is that the mere scale of capital doesn&#x27;t provide competitive advantage.  The wealth tax should be designed to even out the advantage of scale so that larger accumulations of capital need to be put to best use.<p>Putting some numbers on the napkin... The US has an aggregate net worth of $85 trillion dollars.  The federal budget is $4 trillion.  Assuming a power law distribution of net worth, let&#x27;s guesstimate an average 2% tax on that $85 trillion, which comes out to $1.7 trillion.  We could roughly cut income taxes in half or eliminate them except at very high levels ($1M+) if we used a wealth tax instead.<p>The important thing to note here is that the wealth tax still leaves about 2% investment income, it doesn&#x27;t reduce the total over time.  I think it&#x27;s great that people can accumulate wealth and then live on it, or pass it on to the next generation.  But it would be great if we can keep the income at around 1-2% so that the nearly guaranteed increase in accumulated wealth is the same or less than the growth rate of the economy, meaning that people who build businesses today have the ability to reach the same heights as those who built businesses yesterday, without extraordinary luck or blunders by those with wealth.",1453414963

I seriously doubt that giving an extra dollar to an employee generates more than a dollar in actual revenue looking solely at the purchases made by that employee. Maybe there are other social knock-on effects, but I don&#x27;t see them spending more than $x on your own products when you give them $x.<p>One plausible exception would be for items so expensive that they&#x27;re often financed with debt: A car manufacturing company might plausibly generate more than a dollar in revenue in the short-term if its employees borrowed money to finance it.<p>Another plausible exception would be if you gave someone a temporary raise, and they immediately started spending more and going further into debt(think buying a bigger house, bigger car, funding a bonus vacation on a credit card, etc.). Then when you cut their wages 6 months later, it&#x27;s possible that for some items you would&#x27;ve convinced your own employees to spend more money than you gave them on your own products.<p>A third exception might be for companies that completely control the employees&#x27; spending. For example, a prison or a camp full of debt slaves might be paid $3/hour, but they could only spend it on overpriced company goods. Raising it to $4/hour still wouldn&#x27;t exactly generate direct revenue over the long term, but it wouldn&#x27;t cost the company much at all since they&#x27;d capture 100% of the spending. Anything short of that 100% is savings, and people might be more willing to spend down their savings if they thought money was easier to get. So you could - in the short term - make money by raising wages. Doubly-so if you extend them credit(on top of whatever debt they&#x27;re working off).<p>I can&#x27;t think of a way that the &quot;giving people more money gives them more money to give back to you&quot; argument actually works that doesn&#x27;t involve saddling them with debt. And these are merely plausible - I don&#x27;t know that they&#x27;re what would actually happen.<p>Actually, what does them being employees have to do with the argument? If that argument were valid, why wouldn&#x27;t my local grocery store hand out free $20 bills to anyone who comes in, since this would spur them to buy stuff? Or if you were truly convinced that this would make the companies more money, you could easily be a millionaire by buying up a local McDonalds(with a government-backed loan), raising everyone&#x27;s wages, and then when your income goes up by x% reselling the business for an x% increase on the $300,000 or so you bought the McDonald&#x27;s for(and repeating this a couple times).",1453414954

One of the strengths of the JVM is the ecosystem of JVM languages that has evolved. You can stick with the JVM and get many of the benefits mentioned while still being polyglot. In particular you can throw in a dynamic language (Groovy, JRuby, Jython) alongside the Java core and get the benefits of a dynamic language for parts of the code where that is suitable, without losing many of the other benefits. Groovy, in particular, is 100% bidirectionally compatible with Java and has close enough syntax that a developer team well versed in Java will pick it up quickly. Perhaps Kotlin qualifies in this regard as well. To me the optimal setup is a strong Java core defining the APIs and core services, while the less core code can benefit from using more expressive dynamic languages. For example, the drudgery of writing unit tests is hugely alleviated by doing in something like Groovy rather than straight Java.",1453414845

There&#x27;s a reason why copper/steel/oil are plunging.<p>There aren&#x27;t many, if any, examples of &quot;demand drives growth&quot; working in a long term situation. In the short run economies simply need to work out their gluts, and slack. Famously coined &quot;creative destruction,&quot; the unhealthy aspect (especially after Keynes) is that growth become a policy goal rather than sustainability in that growth. To this Keynes said &quot;in the long run we&#x27;re all dead,&quot; putting short term growth into focus of government policy makers rather than long term growth which often requires negative GDP growth and recessions.<p>Anyhow, you&#x27;re also mischaracterizing the Chicago School and Milton Friedman. There is no claim that you can &quot;never run out of demand.&quot; And the &quot;freshwater school&quot; is about discretionary policy of government policy, not whatever you just tried to say. This is one reason why Friedman was fond of the &quot;Friedman rule&quot; or the &quot;K% Rule,&quot; because it took discretionary powers away from the Federal Reserve. The idea is that with rational expectation of monetary growth the market can set its expectations to not be prone to monetary policy failures. The same is true of government failures. The idea of &quot;market failure&quot; is a criticism, but the Chicago School doesn&#x27;t deny market failure exists, only that the government should have a limited discretionary role involved in picking up any demand slack.<p>If the government bought wheat, for instance, to keep its price high and keep farmers employed; then burns it, this creates asset misallocations, though it is technically creating demand (this still happens to this day.) A policy measure is put into place to address a problem, but instead of the market correcting to shift to different types of production it continues its course and creates slack in other areas (such as too little corn, or soy.)",1453414535

- One onion, one head of Garlic: $1.50
- 1lb of Pasta: $2.50
- Parmesian, Some Butter, Parsley: $2.00 (plus you most likely already have this)<p>That creates 4 servings of a fabulous restaurant quality pasta (This is the actual recipe: <a href=""http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2008/09/cooking-with-ryan-pasta-carbonara/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2008/09/cooking-with-ryan...</a>)<p>I made it last night, girlfriend and I have left overs for today.

More interesting, something like:<p><pre><code>    > ! 0 ==   ""0""
    false

    true

Since ""!"" acts as if false === 0.",1222173305

Most brands I've tried have been pretty equivalent, though some will probably be more comfortable for your head than others. Those, coupled with good earplugs* , usually tunes out most human speech around me.<p>* Earplug reviews here: <a href=""http://www.slate.com/id/2118800/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/id/2118800/</a> My favorites are the Moldex Rockets, not listed: <a href=""http://www.labsafety.com/search/Moldex/12675/?type=brand"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.labsafety.com/search/Moldex/12675/?type=brand</a> . Again, fit is at least as important as noise reduction; you want to be able to put them in and forget about them. Earplugs are quite cheap, so you may want to get a grab bag with two pairs each of ten or more kinds.<p>Alternatively, wearing headphones with pink noise (like white noise, but with less hiss: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_noise"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_noise</a>) works well, particularly if you can wear earmuff-style headphones over earplugs.<p>Here is a pink noise loop I made by stitching together the sample loop on wikipedia: <a href=""http://shenani.gen.nz/~scott/pink_noise.mp3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shenani.gen.nz/~scott/pink_noise.mp3</a> (It's released under the same CC license as the sample on wikipedia, as a derived work.) <i>Also, mirror it if you like it, as I am moving this week and in a day or two it will disappear.</i><p>Of course, not having a cubicle or open-air office is the better solution.

A client that demands 100% uptime isn't being unreasonable; they're looking for a contract remedy (most likely a termination right) if/when the site goes down.<p>1. ""Uptime"" is defined in many, many ways.  In the OP's article, it's the definition of uptime that seems unreasonable.  Normally, the demarc points for the network segments and equipment being measured for uptime are entirely within the provider's control.  In the OP article's update, the client clarified that 100% uptime only applies when hosting is cut over to the provider's site  something they are (theoretically) capable of controlling.<p>2.  Remedies for failing the uptime requirement are different for nearly every agreement.  Often SLA credits are the exclusive remedy.  Sometimes the customer has a termination right (either express, or through the termination for cause provision).  The remedy is probably more important than the uptime percentage.<p>You'd be surprised how many big name web apps offer 100% uptime as a matter of contract, knowing that it's a near-impossible operational goal.  It's a matter of taking on the risk of your customer leaving you or claiming SLA credits, or whatever remedies you agree upon.",1317386677

This is to an extent analogous to the rational market hypothesis, and that I doubt to be true.<p>Next Ryan may propose a new system that will be written from scratch to satisfy his no-overly-complex goal.  Only to find that the new software runs on the top of existing hardware which is immensely complex.  Oh, then he thinks about developing hardware again too.  Only to find that hardware development is immensely complex (EDA tools for example).  Oh, then he thinks about developing them again too.  He now concludes that the accumulated complexity hasn't yet become too high after all.<p>After taking all of that into account and if that is not complex by itself, find something intermediate level (say a programming language) that has less complexity at that level (going deeper would increase complexity) and build something on the top of it.

So you need to keep the ship floating by using thrust which makes the control quite interesting IMHO.<p>But yeah I don't know if it could sell, I have designed a pretty big universe for it though.",1317384306

Should I go on?  It's all shit.  Not just what he deals with.",1317384301

OK, so maybe it's windows's drivers fault ;)<p>To sum up, flash disks can only access data by big chunk of say 32KB. So if you have 32 files of 1KB each, the (dumb and not optimized) flash disk driver will overwrite 32 times the 32kb block where the 32 files will be stored. In this example, 1024KB (32 x 32KB) of data is written instead of just 32KB. So it slows you down 32 times in this case.<p>As you can see, the bigger the block and the smaller the files, the slower the transfer.",1317384280

""100%"" is obviously not going to be achievable, but ""external users should be ok if our office network fails"" is not necessarily a bad requirement. There are lots of things that may make this client happy: a VPN to an ""internal"" server in an external data center, synchronous replication, etc.",1317384239

The inability to abstract well has made any medium-to-large software project a Rube Goldberg contraption.  You may not mind it -- but you should.  Because it's silly.  Because it's stupid.  And recognizing that fact is the first step towards our recovery.",1317384046

This is baloney. It's like saying if Obama visits Facebook or Google headquarters these companies now are CIA outlets, or saying if the Fed hires Symantec to secure their networks Symantec is now linked to US government.<p>Of course Central bank of Russia would hire leading Russian security company to secure their network, who else they would hire? What's surprising in that? Of course leading politician may visit a company that is internationally known for its success, especially Medvedev who insisted on emphasizing the ""modern hi-tech president"" image. Cooperation between security researchers and cybercrime divisions of security services is also nothing new - what else security researchers would do with their findings? They can't prosecute computer criminals themselves...
And of course they would get licensed by Russian security services - how else one could get government contracts, which in every country are not negligible source of income for many companies?<p>Making it sound as if pretty standard business practices and realities - which apply both to such undeniably corrupt country as Russia and to the US and to many other developed countries - as a sign of some ominous secrets is a journalistic malpractice.

Luckily there were three people with excellent git knowledge who could answer all questions so this helped a lot.<p>However, I find myself relying on stackoverflow/google for some not-so-common small use cases where a glance at the manual just doesn't help (find all changes in local branch not in upstream branch x?). Also, the git commands and their options are sometimes not very logical as the article mentions (i.e. git show vs. git blame, the first needs the syntax ""branch:file"", the second ""branch file"", why?

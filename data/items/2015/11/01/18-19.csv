Agarkov wanted to deceive the bank and took advantage of some bank&#x27;s clerk not validating the user input.<p>So imagine someone doing this to you. Smuggling some really mean clause into the fine print which you probably won&#x27;t read. How that would sound?<p>Oh, you read all the fine print? Really? I don&#x27;t. Last time I&#x27;ve bought a travel insurance for around 10 Euro a year, it came with a 65-page PDF in language which you need to be a specialist to understand. It would have been incredibly easy for them to write in there that I have to sacrifice my first-born to them, or whatever.<p>According to Russian media, Agarkov scanned and altered the original document with an intention to deceive. There&#x27;s a Russian word &quot;подлог&quot;, roughly translated as &quot;forgery&quot;, &quot;alteration&quot;, &quot;fabrication&quot; into English. So what Agarkov did is exactly &quot;подлог&quot;, this is an absolute match if you read the definition in Wikipedia.<p>There is a number of articles in Russian criminal codex concerning this action. The closes to this case is probably nr. 187 about falsification of credit cards or payment documents. Not an exact fit, but close.",1446404303

Even a publicly funded service is still as vulnerable. Services you run yourself still cost money and have their unique set of problems. The cost benefit to using APIs is that you&#x27;re outsourcing that complexity to someone else in exchange for money so you can concentrate on your core business. It&#x27;s why AWS is so popular. Yes, they could shut down, but the risk is worth it. Doing it all in house is the other risk... maybe your programmers can&#x27;t develop the solution needed and your company tanks because you wasted a bunch of time and money building your own address verification service for fear the external API might shut down.<p>The USPS (which is quasi-private, I&#x27;ll admit) offers address verification, but their service hasn&#x27;t been reliable, which is why we have competitors now. Your fallacy is that because something isn&#x27;t flawless that the whole system is a failure. And throwing around the word &#x27;profit&#x27; as some pejorative, dirty word is an emotional manipulation. How else would people hire or expand if not for profit? The service I&#x27;m using (Smartystreets) now offers international address verification; I&#x27;m not sure how they would have paid for that if it weren&#x27;t for profit. That extra money you bring home from your job after taxes and other expenses... that&#x27;s profit. Your employer is living on borrowed time from the services you provide. What happens when you quit, change your rate, or become bored with your job? I guess it&#x27;s worth the risk to them.",1446404274

Large sweeping changes may require familiarization with a large body of code and the impacts of any single change to the overall system behavior.

We&#x27;re happy that you&#x27;ve found Slack to be a great platform for your community but from both an administrative and performance perspective this is proving to be unsustainable.<p>Although we do simple chat and file-sharing very well, Slack simply isn’t designed for communities of thousands of users to chat. Slack&#x27;s ideally designed for teams of coworkers who collaborate closely and frequently to get work done. That said, looking into ways to better support communities like yours in the future is something that has been suggested many times! The idea is under consideration, and if changes are implemented to make this easier in the future, we&#x27;ll be sure to get the word out.<p>I’m not sure how you’re sending out your invites, because if you’re using the web interface it should tell you that your maximum user limit was reached. If you’re using the undocumented API, we’re returning a user_limit_reached error that you&#x27;ll run into soon.<p>If you do want to continue to use Slack to manage this community, I&#x27;d recommend you spin up multiple smaller teams and cap each one around no more than 1,000 users. Once one team fills up, stop inviting people to that team and start a new one for the next group of people who want to join your community. That&#x27;s the best way to ensure that your teams remain manageable and that the service stays nice and snappy for you.<p>Thanks so much for your understanding.

10487582,comment,10484493,10487485,0,0,HiLo,,,"That&#x27;s a pretty interesting solution to a pretty interesting problem. This happens all the time in the physical commodities markets - you insert or remove a document required to make payment on a letter of credit, shorten the time windows for payment, try to get the counterparty to pay for external costs (insurance, port agents, bunkers, fines, and an entire department just for this type of thing as it concerns demurrage), and so on.<p>So the problem is obviously there, and believe it or not, even among the least tech-savvy everybody is aware of this problem, how it&#x27;s done, and current methods to minimize it. It&#x27;s very important. For example, look at Vitol, the biggest energy trading house in the world (followed by Glencore and Trafigura, both split from the same company). This doesn&#x27;t include metals or ags. Vitol has $300 billion or so in revenue per year. Strictly looking at their trading business, and considering minimum wholesale volumes around 25,000 barrel lots (barge sizes in the Gulf Coast), so wholesale crude and products trades in blocks worth between $1.5 and $2 million at today&#x27;s prices. While this is an extremely simplified, ballpark analysis, assuming their trading business has a 2% net margin, they&#x27;re selling $300 billion that they bought for $294 billion. Roughly, that&#x27;s about 300,000 transactions for separate, physical movements of petroleum and products. Saving even a few days on payment terms across the board would mean they have to borrow money for a few less days, which would add up to millions of dollars in cash savings that begin to accrue immediately and continue to daily over time.<p>So, again, the problem is there, and various groups have attempted to build software (which actually did work, technically). The big problem is that implementation of these tools has been tried in areas such as Letters of Credit (negotiation between counterparties and banks for each one if doing transactional trade finance) and the rest of trade finance. The problem isn&#x27;t the tools, it&#x27;s that the companies kind of like to play this game, because if you see yourself as on the more sophisticated end of the market then this benefits you, and this system is tried and true, whereas the new system could be prone to errors or other unknown unknowns, where they don&#x27;t know how to protect themselves.<p>edit: By the way, much of the above (especially as it concerns the individual specifications of each order, either physical variables in the commodities markets or financial variables in the bond and derivatives markets) is exactly the reason implementation of more streamlined alternatives for clearing and settlement have been so slow. It&#x27;s not that the technology for actually doing it isn&#x27;t there, it&#x27;s that the bottlenecks leading up to that are still there. So if you have a good way for traders to automatically decide which fees and costs apply when and to who, please do tell, but then you&#x27;ve effectively automated the traders, as much of what they do is negotiating those terms.",1446404060

When the axis-aligned bounding boxes for two objects intersect, you create an object pair and start GJK for the pair. It walks along the edges and faces of the polyhedra to find the shortest distance.  This is O(log N) on the number of vertices.  On the next frame, you rerun GJK starting from the previous result, and if the objects haven&#x27;t moved much, look at 0 or 1 new edges, vertices, or faces.  So the incremental approach is nearly constant time after the startup.<p>Doing a dot-product for every face pair is O(N^2).  Bad for large N. If you do this right, convex hulls with a few hundred faces are no problem.<p>When constructing convex hulls for this, you can use a tool like QHull. Tell it that you want at least some minimal angle such as 1 degree at each edge.  This will eliminate many near-coplanar faces.  Also, it&#x27;s better to use polygonal faces than triangular faces.  With triangles, a rectangular face has two coplanar faces, and GJK will toggle between them, making resting object jiggle.  (Basic annoyance of polyhedra and roundoff: if you tesselate, you get coplanar faces; if you use polygon faces, they&#x27;re not perfectly flat.)",1446403304

Recipients disliked email from dialup IPs because ISPs seemed unwilling or unable to police their customers and respond to individual abuse reports, and so little legitimate email originated there anyway that it was easier to just cut them off.<p>I don&#x27;t think the bigger end-user providers have been very involved in developing those kinds of policies.

No water cooled barrel, no requirement for a heavy tripod, in the light machine gun use case it was fired from a bipod, and could be put into use quickly.<p>Those extra, quick change barrels were a <i>feature</i>, not a bug, such a German infantry unit was organized around the GPMG, one guy would carry it, others would carry spare barrels and ammo, their job was in part to keep the machine gun running and protected from the enemy.<p>Issues like the high rate of fire were a tactical choice the Germans made, shared by no others to my memory (I believe the theory is that you would seldom have a good target for long, so you had to make the best of it while it existed).

Most of LA&#x27;s businesses avoid LA&#x27;s startup scene.  Like SF, the startup scene here is a self-congratulatory frat party fueled by VC money, where funding announcements are celebrated with raucous applause but profit announcements are greeted by a silent room.<p><i>There is literally no alternative to seek another company in the same space in LA because most likely the company doesn&#x27;t exist. You don&#x27;t really have the freedom to still be in a certain tech category while avoiding certain companies in that space....About the only tech space you have options in is if you want to be part of a tech boutique shop that does custom websites for the big movie companies. I know people in that field and they seem happy with what they&#x27;re doing so if that is your thing, LA could work out.</i><p>Your problem is that you used a single random list website as your data point. LA&#x27;s a big place with many tech or tech-related businesses, and there are few if any websites that even attempt to gather all of that data.<p>LA has hundreds of companies revolutionizing media technology--nearly every VFX company in the area is working on some sort of innovative technology or software, companies like Machinima and Red Bull changed the way we produce media, and companies like Hulu have changed the way we consume media. LA is the home to hundreds of triple-AAA and indie video game developers, from the <i>Braid</i> guy and Riot Games to EA and Square Enix. We&#x27;ve got dozens of companies in the tech advertising space that you&#x27;ve never heard of even though they&#x27;re wildly profitable because they&#x27;re purely B2B. We&#x27;ve got hundreds of companies in the fashion/apparel space innovating at every step in the fashion process, from design to end-customer sales.  LA is still <i>the</i> place to be for aerospace technology.  While SF startups dream about one day dipping their toes into logistics, LA-based companies have already revolutionized the technologies and process underlying the biggest logistics operations in the Northern Hemisphere several times over.<p>And yes, we even have startups like Snapchat, a social app that no one in a media town would even remotely consider a media company.<p><i>Oh yeah and they also pay kinda shitty considering LA (especially Venice, Santa Monica, Playa Vista where Rubicon is) is not cheap. And although I&#x27;m sure some companies do offer free snacks/perks, I&#x27;ve heard a lot where they aren&#x27;t expected to provide that because it&#x27;s LA, not SF.</i><p>Venice, Manhattan Beach, and beach-adjacent Santa Monica is LA&#x27;s Silicon Beach area.  Like most beach cities in desirable areas they are expensive, though it is possible to live inland and pay reasonable rates for housing.  Most businesses are spread out across LA, and with the exception of the video game cluster in Playa Del Rel (a beach city south of Santa Monica) most of the clusters are not in the beach-adjacent areas.",1446401545

It&#x27;s heavy on hype and subjective opinion, light on facts and outright misleading in a few places, for example:<p>- 1-1.5kb of memory per process is for a process that does nothing. It&#x27;s less overhead than any other platform I know of, but I am not sure how that translates to: <i>&quot;Want to keep track of a large portfolio of stocks? Easy. Want to keep track of the whole market? No sweat.&quot;</i><p>- 9 9s uptime is a function of architecture, not language.

Elixir is not going to give you anything for free.<p><i>&quot;Massive parallelism also results in massive redundancy.&quot;</i> - how exactly? My massively parallel application could be running on one machine. The author must have meant distribution which Erlang/OTP is indeed very good at.<p><i>&quot;Want to coordinate across markets or geographies?&quot;</i><p>You would certainly not want to distribute an Erlang cluster across two different data centers, much less geographies.<p><i>&quot;Add more hardware, and Elixir&#x27;s performance will increase almost linearly along with it.&quot;</i><p>No it won&#x27;t - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law</a><p><i>&quot;Moreover, whereas Erlang was built to run on telecom networks, Elixir is built to run websites, phone apps and web services.

Almost all of what you&#x27;ve said applies equally well if you replace &quot;insider trading&quot; with &quot;professional trading&quot;.<p>If you send a 1000 share buy order to the market, knowing that you&#x27;re going to send 99 more of them throughout the day, you&#x27;re making money (or at least losing less money) because of information that you have and your counterparties don&#x27;t. And that kind of trading definitely has a negative effect on liquidity (almost the whole difficulty in market making is preferentially trading against people who <i>aren&#x27;t</i> doing this). But this splitting of orders is universally viewed as &quot;ok&quot;, and is how most large-volume trading is done these days.<p>The difference between this and insider trading is in <i>who owns the information</i>. Most people view the large-volume trader as doing something okay, because they own the information about their own future trading behavior. Insider trading is illegal not because it&#x27;s unfair to trade on asymmetric information, but because you&#x27;re trading on information that was <i>stolen from the company</i>. (This is why Mark Cuban didn&#x27;t go to prison: a company gave him some insider information, but forgot to ask him not to trade on it; no stealing involved).<p>From this perspective, it makes sense to prosecute the original tipper, and anyone in the chain who knew (or should have known) that the information was stolen (by analogy to the crime of passing stolen goods), but not the guys at the end who were clueless about the scheme. (Although it might make sense to make them disgorge their trading profits.)",1446401198

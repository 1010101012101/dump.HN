7137783,comment,7135206,7135790,12,0,throwaway46163,,,"My girlfriend volunteers full-time for the local food pantry. It was formerly an independent nonprofit, but a few years ago it was taken over by United Way.<p>Since then, any and all cash donations, given on site at the pantry itself, are funnelled to United Way. The pantry never sees a single cent of the money and United Way does not provide any food (UW employs two people and sends a truck periodically that delivers food from an unaffiliated food bank). No one who works there has any idea where the money goes or what happens to it. The employees there are not allowed to explain this to donors. The donors, of course, have no idea either.<p>The pantry is only allowed to keep tangible foodstuffs that are donated directly to them, which they can then give to people who need it. The pantry often runs out of certain types of food. When they do, there&#x27;s nothing they can do but hope someone will donate more of that specific item, meanwhile watching as the cash donations that could be used to buy it get sent away.<p>I realize this sounds implausible and I can&#x27;t cite any sources for it[1]. Just be careful about the assumptions you make regarding where the money goes. Food is food and people can eat it. Money can get funnelled or turned into other things, and unless you&#x27;re there to watch it happen, you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on.<p>[1]: Howevever, if you haven&#x27;t already, read the Wikipedia page on United Way sometime and see if you can figure out what it is that they actually do, other than collect money, build bureaucracy and get involved in major scandals.",1390924732

And they constitute the majority of the protesters. Many of them are indifferent to nationalism or negatively predisposed to it. Many of them don’t support integration into the EU. People go into the streets to protest against police violence. And a significant part of them is unenthusiastic or even skeptical about the clashes in the Grushevskogo street. Often one can hear that right radicals are a “Trojan horse” of Yanukovych and special services, designed to discredit the protest. Certainly there would be many more Kievites participating in the protests if there was a way to take those idiots useful to the government out of the streets.<p>also: <a href=""http://observers.france24.com/content/20140127-protests-growing-russia-eastern-ukraine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://observers.france24.com/content/20140127-protests-grow...</a>",1390924686

7137776,comment,7136735,7137481,19,0,austenallred,,,"I don&#x27;t know if I can answer your question, but I lived in eastern Ukraine for two years (yes, I speak fluent Russian), and my frustration with the media and journalism there has sent me on a three year (so far) journey to make everyday people the driving force of journalism instead of governments and corporations.<p>And please take note, it&#x27;s impossible to speak for a group of people or boil down what&#x27;s happening to anything concrete when it&#x27;s very disparate and unique to each individual. But I&#x27;ll point out a few trends I&#x27;ve seen.<p>For some background, eastern Ukraine is very pro-Russian, and was (and is) very pro-Yanukovytch. The majority of the people I talked to pined for the days of the Soviet Union, when bread was cheap, everyone had what they needed, etc. They viewed the fall of the soviet union as a psychological infiltration from the west, and, apart from a short rendezvous to defeat Hitler, the west is still the enemy and full of corrupt capitalist blood suckers (which, to be fair, can be not-too-far from the truth at times). It&#x27;s hard for most westerners to imagine that many of the major cities in Ukraine have a 30 ft + statue of Lenin or that many of the major streets are named &quot;Lenin&quot; street, but it&#x27;s not uncommon for me to see poems or images praising Stalin from my Russian Facebook (or Vkontakte) friends. The Soviet Union was the good ol&#x27; days, not grouped together with pre-WWII Germany as it often is in the States. Stalin is decidedly not Hitler. I include this information not to say that anti-protest comments come from Soviets/Communists, but the influence of the Soviet Union and how information was relayed still lingers, even today.<p>When most of the people there, especially the older generations, talked about the media, they would often reference a transmission from Moscow (передача из Москвы) as the only source of reliable information. Think of it as &quot;published in the New York Times.&quot; And bear in mind that the New York Times has been just as involved in Propaganda as was Pravda in its heyday.<p>The battle, in the mind of Russians, is one of information, and of each side trying to deceive the other. Americans look at pro-Communist posters as &quot;propaganda&quot; but at the western side&#x27;s as simply &quot;promotional posters.&quot; Russians see it as an ideological battle being fought with information.<p>For many Russians this is the same battle being fought. It&#x27;s not revolutionaries vs. evil dictator, it&#x27;s east vs. west. It&#x27;s Russia vs. the Europe/United States. And when a battle of information leads to such sharp contrasts, you defend your side, in a similar way to how Republicans defended George Bush when he did stupid things and Democrats defend Barack Obama when he does stupid things. It&#x27;s not about the particular circumstance, it&#x27;s about ideology. You&#x27;ll notice a common thread of &quot;Well, sometimes Russia sucks, but America sucks sometimes too.&quot; Which, again, is completely fair. And again, this is not something that <i>only</i> happens in Russia.<p>But this leads to trying to sway the facts in favor of one side, and that often leads to gross misinterpretation of what is actually going on. Russia Today and Pravda are state-sponsored PR organizations dressed up as journalistic institutions. When the protests began, according to RT it was &quot;a handful of people&quot; gathered, angry at &quot;a failed trade law,&quot; and not the bubbling over of frustration as a completely corrupt President threw his enemies in jail and deepened relations with Putin.<p>Take, for example, the naked protestor who was mocked by police, photographed, slapped, kicked, and put in a van (graphic video:) <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSt4kAItj4Q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSt4kAItj4Q</a>. Many of my Russian friends would tell you he was trying to set himself on fire, the police saved him, took pictures &quot;in memoriam,&quot; gave him a few friendly slaps, and let him go. They would leave comments like &quot;Let him burn next time!&quot; or &quot;Be careful, police, you&#x27;re only giving the terrorists more psychological ammunition!&quot;<p>So, to answer your question, in the mind of a Russian it&#x27;s because we&#x27;re still fighting a war of information, and the west likes to deceive and destroy Russia psychologically. They defend their ideology the same way we defend ours, and sometimes information and facts are left out to dry.",1390924658

Not surprising Russians are not keen Ukraine to get separated from Russia either. But why is that unfortunate?<p>Correct. I happen to be a Russian-speaking Ukrainian and I am much more in favor of Ukraine being more open to the west and breaking away from Russia, but I know that&#x27;s not the only opinion. The fact that not everybody agrees is in my opinion unfortunate because Russia has no interest in investing in Ukraine&#x27;s future.<p>> Also I hope you are not suggesting that opinions should be somehow filtered based on whether a poster has a Russian name.<p>Not in the slightest. I am suggesting that people who don&#x27;t know much about the situation do their own research rather than trusting comments on the several stories that ended up on HN in the past few days.

True, Google most famously uses Python, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s actually good for most of the tasks distributed computing implies. It&#x27;s a big discussion, but I&#x27;ll leave it at - use Python for the parts that are simple logic if you must, but the actual distributed parts, you are better off using something with better suited tools such as Clojure, Lisp, Erlang, etc. I&#x27;ve found Python simply creates problems not worth solving and necessitates lots of ugly tradeoffs like tons of task queue usage for no good reason.<p>If you must stay with Python besides the testing comments, I would say:<p>1. For the love of God, please use keyword arguments. Why? If some enterprising developer decides it&#x27;s time to refactor a function, god bless them if they think IDE tools will work perfectly. Ordered args are your enemy in a large code base, don&#x27;t use them if you don&#x27;t have to. Obviously, sometimes you must for dynamic reasons.<p>2. Don&#x27;t be afraid to use classes. Seems like a lot of newer Python developers go wild in projects with module level functions. These can be useful and great, especially for functional constructs, but classes can help cut down on a lot of repetitive code.<p>3. Proper naming. Seems stupid, but in Python people still name things badly. Use expressive names, and that goes for modules too.<p>4. Build for generators and list comprehensions. If you build code that is simple, atomic, and reusable, then they will blend really well into both generators and list comprehensions. This cuts down on the code you need by a lot. A corollary is don&#x27;t implement all your logic inside a comprehension because it&#x27;s 1 line. If you do something more than once, obviously make it into a proper atomic unit of code instead of repeating yourself. A second corollary is you will find in Python that if you focus on these two things, you solve a large number of simple problems, including doing things elegantly with lots of dynamic behavior if that&#x27;s what you need from the language.<p>5. Use virtualenv. People will hate working with you if it&#x27;s hard to replicate your environment or it screws with your machine. Inevitably in large code bases, you will end up with different versions of dependencies in different branches and such.<p>6. Don&#x27;t abuse __init__.py . This can cause some really weird behaviors if you have a lot of code importing the same packages again and again. I&#x27;ve seen bizarre race-like conditions occur because of this. Honestly, I think there&#x27;s not much of a reason to ever use it except maybe to stick in some meta information about the package if you need/want to query it later.<p>7. Central settings management. Applies to any language, but have a way to handle all the settings from the ridiculous packages you use.<p>8. Namespace/group your settings values and don&#x27;t rely on the module to do this for you. i.e. don&#x27;t create stuff like WIDTH = 50. Instead, group it with other settings and use a variable to namespace it properly.<p>9. Don&#x27;t import * from every package. I think the google code guidelines at one point disagreed with this, but really it is obnoxious in a large code base.<p>10. If you find yourself using 10 parameters or something, you probably needed an object. Just because you can do kwargs.get and kwargs.pop doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t create proper objects. Callers in large code bases need to understand what they are passing in without reading all your source constantly.<p>I have many more tips, but I think this is enough of a starting point.",1390923343

Make the candidates work for that high number. Let them prove it. If you the employer thinks it is worth giving that number, then they will give it. If you think that there is a risk that a mediocre candidate might demand that high number, then it is the fault of employer for not being able to negotiate correctly.<p>&quot;It seems the trend is starting to move towards publicizing the members of teams where that could be a recruiting tool. &quot;<p>I agree with you here. Team description are definitely getting tricky in the world of social stuff. Where do we draw the line ? Publicly exposing your team members (specially at startups) can mean poaching attempts by others.<p>&quot;When it&#x27;s a replacement due to termination or turnover, don&#x27;t expect that to be advertised.&quot;<p>Sure but that still doesn&#x27;t change the fact why you are hiring. You don&#x27;t want to say &quot;we fired someone&quot; sure but why can&#x27;t you at least say &quot;one of our team members left and  we need someone to take over his role&quot;. There is a reason for this. Good candidates want to know if they are going to be join a role which was already there OR is a new role being created for a new requirement ? These things matter to a great candidate but obviously not to a medicore one.<p>&quot;If they are industry average, they typically aren&#x27;t worth mentioning.&quot;<p>Thats just a lazy way of saying &quot;we are too lazy to tell you the benefits because well everyone gets it&quot;.

My site is this <a href=""http://codeflow.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codeflow.org/</a> I haven&#x27;t been terribly happy with Apache, it&#x27;s, fast-ish, but configuring it is pain. Also dispatching dynamic requests via (whatever mod-wsgi or something) isn&#x27;t quite as fast. I&#x27;ve run cherokee for the last couple of years, but have my own grievances with that (doesn&#x27;t support gzip+content-length, impossible to hand edit configuration, kinda slow, that kind of thing again).<p>I&#x27;ve had run-ins with nginx, and it&#x27;s pretty cool, except configuring it is a giant pain. Also, it still isn&#x27;t dispatching dynamic requests as fast as could be (goes trough a socket to another process or whatever).<p>Then there&#x27;s stuff that no webserver out there does really satisfactory, which is low-latency websockets. Reason is that they proxy the websockets trough to another process, and even though it&#x27;s on the local machine, this just drives latency up by whole dozens of milliseconds...<p>Ok, so what&#x27;s my obsession with speed all about? My capital is strictly limited, so I&#x27;ve got to run whatever I want to run on my own VPS. Unfortunately I started running <a href=""http://webglstats.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webglstats.com/</a> the tracker of which is embedded in some 500 other sites. They shuffle traffic me at a rate of between 5-10 stat impressions per second, and each of those triggers 3 requests (two gets, one post). I concurrently run around 50-150 open connections at all times.<p>So naturally I&#x27;d want the tracker to run as fast as I can, and I&#x27;d like my other web properties not to slow down because I run a high-traffic service on that server. And I found that pretty much everything out there just isn&#x27;t very good at that.<p>So having had finally enough after years, I wrote my own. It&#x27;s about 1500 lines of python, it&#x27;s asynchronous, can do http-pipelining, has a dynamic dispatch router that can do things like vhosts, has an inotify integration so it avoids stat&#x27;ing static files all the time, it lets me plug python modules directly into the webserver (so no more subprocesses/sockets/fastcgi/whatever for dynamic requests). It does around 4000 requests/s, it easily does at least 512 concurrent open connections, it peaks at a troughput on localhost of +300mb/s and it does that while maintaining a maximum latency (on localhost) of 2ms, or outside (across about 6 hops) of around 15ms.<p>I&#x27;m happy with that, and now that the I spent the last two weeks writing that server (it&#x27;s not the first I wrote, but I finally took the leap), I&#x27;m 100% sure that whatever problem I encounter in my hosting adventures, I can make my server solve them.",1390923166

I2C&#x27;s &quot;idle&quot; level is high thanks to pull ups, the devices only drive the bus through an open drain.<p>Sometimes a device&#x27;s state machine will go fubar (either because of a hardware bug or programing error) and will lock the bus down, basically making it impossible for anybody else to use it.<p>If this happens the next step is to disconnect/reset all other devices on the bus to make sure which one is screwing up (that&#x27;s the difficulty with I2C, since the two lines can be driven by any master or slave you can never really know who&#x27;s doing what when things go wrong).<p>An other thing to look for is the level of the line. Since there are many devices and pull ups on the wire it&#x27;s not common to have messed up levels (0 is really 0.2 or 1 is really 0.8, if the pull up is too strong or too weak respectively). Depending on temperature and other factors that can lead certain interfaces to sample bad values.<p>And then well... you have to capture the transaction that causes the lock up and try to understand what goes wrong...<p>As a quick fix it might just be possible to force a reset of the bogus chip when a lockup is detected, that would prevent having to restart everything. There&#x27;s usually a GPIO for that (if they wired it...).<p>I hope you have a good oscilloscope!<p>Quite frankly I can empathize with the dev not wanting to look into this bug, by the looks of it that&#x27;s the kind of minor bug that&#x27;ll take several days to track down and fix.",1390923150

The files require no complex codes to put into crazy websites, no additional software to install, no additional devices to buy. Being free is just icing on the cake.<p>Case in point: I bought Pacific Rim on blue ray when it was released a few months ago. Waited for it to arrive in the mail. Defeated its stupid plastic wrap. Popped some popcorn, turned the lights off, put the disc in my PS3 (the only blue ray player I own) and... nothing.

Never had this problem before, and sadly my PS3 is not connected to the internet. This disc was useless to me.

I&#x27;ve been hand-writing websites for over 15 years (back when all I had was Notepad on a Windoze box). I think I&#x27;d approach this sort of learning adventure more along these lines:<p>1. HTML/CSS (This is the end-result a browser needs, and you can write it all by hand yourself; by not using any grid/layout frameworks you&#x27;ll learn all the fun things that CSS can do for you and you can focus on making clean semantic markup without any other dynamic distractions.)<p>2. Do some simple backend stuff that now dynamically generates the above HTML/CSS based on some simple logic (I&#x27;m thinking PHP to start because it&#x27;s on almost every server already so you don&#x27;t need to worry about installing anything... just get used to the idea of generating the above static HTML with some programming logic.)<p>3. Add a database (probably going to want to go with MySQL for the same reason as PHP; learn how to store data in the cloud and retrieve it to show in your dynamic pages)<p>4. Maybe learn some server config (probably Apache) but don&#x27;t get too carried away because you can do a lot before you need to be installing Apache modules and tweaking environment variables... I&#x27;d just start by playing with redirects and error pages)<p>5. Now that you can build a full-stack website, I&#x27;d probably beef up my graphic design skills to make that shit sparkle (Usability, information hierarchy, and clear communication are the names of the game here. Design skills can make up for many technical difficulties if you think about the business problem you&#x27;re trying to solve, not just how fancy you can make your sorting algorithm)<p>6. With the fundamentals under your belt, <i>now</i> I&#x27;d start looking into frameworks and libraries and helper tools that can make all of the above easier and faster. Now you&#x27;ll understand what those tools are really doing for you and where they&#x27;re appropriate to pull out. Get your CSS grid, your LESS compiler, your deployment tool, your database inspector, your autocompleting IDE (if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re into) and make the computer do the grunt work, but now with the understanding of how it&#x27;s helping you so that you can bend it to your will.<p>7. Move on to more advanced stuff like front-end MVC, non-blocking backend, websockets, streaming, ssl, localstorage, scaling optimizations, etc. But now that you can do the foundation yourself, you can add-on any of these advanced techniques as needed (no one in particular is absolutely necessary as they are specialized to particular tasks).<p>To me, <i>this</i> is the sort of DIY path that should be taken, step by step, to really understand how to construct a web property.

It&#x27;s still going.  We&#x27;ve been profitable almost every year, but not wildly so.  If I were to give the name, most here would say it is not a successful company.  I&#x27;m by no means rich.  We have never missed a payroll in that 30 years.  Not once.  Yes, I&#x27;ve fired people.  I&#x27;ve done layoffs.  I&#x27;ve never done one thing that I can&#x27;t live with at night when I go to sleep.  None of my decisions keep me awake.<p>However, I was presented with many, many forks in the road.  One road (the one I took) was a &quot;good&quot; one.  The other would have allowed me to profit, sometimes much more than the other decision.  I&#x27;ve watched very successful people over the years and I came to realize that they often take that more profitable road.<p>Because of the types of decisions we make, outsiders call us a &quot;family&quot; business.  That is CEO-speak for we can&#x27;t make the hard decisions needed to increase profits, often at the expense of the people that work for us.  I&#x27;ve had long discussions with serially successful people, and their primary advice, stop being a family business, don&#x27;t be friends with your employees and start squeezing everyone for productivity and profit.  It&#x27;s what potential investors and buyers want to see, they say.<p>So, my sample is relatively small, but I&#x27;ve talked with lots of potential investors, VCs and just plain successful people, and I&#x27;ve definitely seen a real pattern.",1390921603

7137397,comment,7136673,7137132,3,0,fecak,,,"A couple explanations from a recruiter (why recruiters do these things):\n- Company name: Agency recruiters don&#x27;t post company names typically because they are afraid other recruiting companies might steal their clients. If a competitor agency sees COMPANY is hiring, they might call and try to compete for their business. This is a huge fear in the contingency recruiting world, but in the retained world it isn&#x27;t as big an issue. (I post client names, but my business isn&#x27;t contingency)<p>- Salary range: The problem with posting a salary range is that candidates only hear the high number. Most will say that isn&#x27;t true, but I&#x27;ve been recruiting for 15 years and whenever I gave a salary range to candidates of say 100-120, they would automatically expect that they would get the 120. Any offer below 120 was considered lowball. I&#x27;m sure there will be some who say they wouldn&#x27;t feel that way, but it happened almost every time.<p>- Team description: Interesting that you mention personal info. It seems the trend is starting to move towards publicizing the members of teams where that could be a recruiting tool. If you have great engineers that are willing to have a somewhat public face for your company, many companies seem willing to use that to their advantage in today&#x27;s environment. The risk of exposing team members to poaching by other firms used to be a larger concern, but now most people can be found via LinkedIn, GitHub, blogs, etc.<p>- Why you are looking to hire: When it&#x27;s growth and new projects, I&#x27;ll usually list it. When it&#x27;s a replacement due to termination or turnover, don&#x27;t expect that to be advertised.<p>- Benefits: Again, if the information is positive we tend to list it. If they are industry average, they typically aren&#x27;t worth mentioning.<p>It&#x27;s possible to write job descriptions that will get great responses while including none of the things you list here (except perhaps location).",1390921345

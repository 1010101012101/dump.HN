6599494,comment,6597336,6598629,2,0,stiff,,,"I will give you a really prosaic example: I was writing a JavaScript carousel, where from a collection of N elements, K were displayed at a time, and you could jump J elements to the left, or J elements to the right, additionally the whole thing was looped so you could endlessly scroll to the left or to the right.<p>I initially just wrote it like most JavaScript is written, here define an onclick, here remove some HTML elements, here add some HTML elements etc. I tracked some state here, some state there, but the data wasn&#x27;t very structured, that&#x27;s better phrasing I guess. Soon I ended up having bugs in the logic that I had problems fixing. What helped me immensely was defining an abstract SlidingWindow type, which stored the complete array of the elements, the width of the window, the width of one &quot;slide&quot; and carefully defined the elementary operations like slideLeft, and what they do to the data. This is what I mean by the ability to recognize underlying data structures and make those explicit.<p>Going from the first form of the code to the second was the essence of the structured programming movement. When OO came to be it felt out of fashion, but the OO people tend to only teach modelling on problems with really quite obvious decompositions, and as a result one doesn&#x27;t learn this ability of noticing a data structure that could be formalized in a mess of straight-line code.",1382543758

Antibiotic resistance must literally cost bacteria some efficiency in some of their other functions.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that there must be a cost; furthermore, I think it&#x27;s unlikely that if there is a cost, it is high enough to be significant. Bugs evolve, but they do not necessarily evolve optimally all of the time. It is possible that an evolutionary step towards resistance might also improve the fitness of the germ overall (for example, by further optimizing the efficiency of a metabolic pathway). That evolutionary step might have been inevitable, but required additional selective pressure or the presence of a more active mutagen to actually occur.<p>Your claim is sort of assuming that each bug is already optimal for its environment, and any change must therefore be deleterious in some regard, but I hold that neither fact is necessarily true.",1382543715

There&#x27;s more to it, of course, but I can see where that one part was probably the large heap of their troubles.<p>I was not thinking rationally about this whole issue when it first came up and thus didn&#x27;t measure my previous experience  when I was thinking about the issue, but I actually have worked with healthcare systems integration before.  Even with all government inefficiency/management aside (we were a private company), interfacing with healthcare providers is an extremely complicated and painful business.<p>For instance, there is a HIPAA standard interface protocol for things like Eligibility and Benefits and Claim Submission, and most (though still not all!) health care plans have some sort of system through which you can interface for that information - though often it&#x27;s hidden behind miles of red tape and fundamentally different implementations for various custom fields, and different interpretations of the meaning of many fields.  That alone is painful, and that part is supposed to be &quot;standardized&quot;.<p>I can&#x27;t even imagine the state of healthcare provider&#x27;s policy estimation systems, particularly when it comes to interfacing with them.  It&#x27;s speculation on my part, but I imagine that each healthcare provider would likely have to have their estimation systems tied into.  I wonder how many even had it exposed in such a way at the start of this project that you <i>could</i> tie into it, and how many of them had a wide variety of custom inputs to take into account in their estimating.  Though you are right that perhaps the new law allowed/forced them to simplify this estimation process, in which case each of these providers likely had to modify the ruleset of their ancient systems before the integrators could actually work with it.  Yeah, I could see even a simplified ruleset for policy pricing and eligibility as being a major factor in slowing down this process.<p>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t have wanted to be a software developer on this project, thinking more about how bureaucratic and inefficient both the government and healthcare providers are.  I still feel like, even then, 500 million is a dubious number - and I&#x27;d like to see where that money went. (how many people were employed on the project and for what cost, what were they being charged for hardware and datacenter(s), etc...)

And, they will.<p>But, this will come with a genetic cost to the bacteria.<p>The reason that antibiotics work is because they are attacking some function that has deliberately evolved, through natural selection, to be like that. Antibiotic resistance must literally cost bacteria some efficiency in some of their other functions.<p>This cost was originally such that the bacteria would die. Fantastic. But note: we wouldn&#x27;t actually benefit from all bacteria dying at the mention of the word antibiotic, and some bacterial resistance is good for us.<p>Under normal circumstances, bacteria that don&#x27;t need to carry around antibiotic resistance with them will most likely have a lower genetic cost and thrive better. This may be why we have seen MRSA predominantly in hospitals and rarely in the &#x27;wild&#x27;. (If MRSA was necessary or not costly, all SA would be MR all the time).<p>This gives me some hope - that antibiotic resistance is balanced, genetically forcing bacteria to be less effective in other ways and less competitive in other circumstances.<p>We humans are not out yet.",1382543414

Coincidentally, I just wrote about this, but I&#x27;ll copy and paste here because it seems relevant.<p>A friend of mine recently asked me how Apple expected to continue making any money while giving away software that Microsoft charges $200 for. Understanding how Apple can give away their software and still make money comes in understanding Apple&#x27;s business. Apple pundits frequently circle back to the point that Apple is a “hardware” company. As it turns out, they are wrong. Apple is a “devices” company. What is unique about Apple is their view that a device is made up of hardware & software, and that these two are inseparable. Apple believes this is the best view if you want to deliver a superior experience to the users of your products.<p>If you look at Apple as a hardware company — which I believe is a mistake — they make better margins than any of their competitors. Following that flawed line of thinking, what they&#x27;re doing now is using that extra profit to subsidize the software side. This viewpoint only holds if you view the hardware and software sides of the business as separate entities though.<p>Apple has combined the two. You&#x27;re not buying hardware or software, you&#x27;re buying a device. What good is a microwave without the software that connects the buttons to the timer, microwave generator, etc? Thats how Apple views their devices. By making Mavericks and iWork free, theyre expanding their notion of the &quot;post PC world&quot;. They&#x27;re not just talking about iOS devices, theyre talking about their entire line up.<p>If youre wondering why Apples “PC” sales continue to grow while everyone else is sinking, I think youve found your answer.<p><a href=""http://www.bradlanders.com/2013/10/23/apples-greater-vision-of-the-post-pc-world/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bradlanders.com/2013/10/23/apples-greater-vision-...</a>",1382543348

Except that because they were using an incremental deployment it was not actually removed from one of the servers. It was not really a case of untested software being run, but rather one of the servers running an older version of the software due to a deployment failure. The newer version repurposed the Power Peg flag, but since that one server was still running an older version of the code it behaved differently. It carried out the old behavior, which was not suitable for the current environment.<p>This is the biggest argument in my opinion against incremental deployment: it is hard to know <i>exactly</i> what is on any given box.

The last few OS upgrades were cheap. iWork is cheaper than MS Office (because it is often an optional extra with office being mandatory) and (ironically) being in the iOS market means that they have an €8.99 version of iWork anchoring he price. Overall software sales are not big money makers for Apple.<p>OTOH, you they can simplify a bunch of things by making OSX upgrades cheaper. Users no longer need to worry about OS updates (eg time their purchase). They can sell macs as &quot;ready to go with all the software you need&quot; for creative or office workers. A new mac will be easier to get used to. Developers can target a single OS version, this includes Apple. Apple can release features relying on new OS features.<p>It&#x27;s just simpler. Apple have an aesthetic preference for simpler. For the cost of whatever revenue these software sales were bringing in they get to improve and simplify the mac ownership experience.

6599398,comment,6593332,6598362,2,0,betterunix,,,"&quot;Consider the current system of government fiat and credit: the US dollar requires vast armies and navies, the vast and expanding Federal Reserve apparatus with its system of member/franchised banks, employees of the IRS, the US Treasury, the Secret Service (I&#x27;m redundant, I know). Millions of people are dedicated to propping up the &quot;full faith and credit&quot;.&quot;<p>Let&#x27;s set aside the issue of whether or not the military is needed for the dollar to remain valuable and speak strictly about security here.  You have mentioned no less than three security goals:<p>1. Preventing counterfeiting<p>2. Enforcing tax payments<p>3. Preventing theft<p>Now, let&#x27;s see what happens with Bitcoin:<p>1. Counterfeiting is replaced with double spending, and you need at least as much energy to be devoted to fighting this as would be needed for an attack.<p>2. Bitcoin does nothing to reduce the energy needed to enforce tax payments, it just shifts the goalposts slightly.<p>3. Wallet theft is a real problem, and Bitcoin itself does nothing to combat it; you still need to devote energy to securing your wallet, no different than depositing money in a bank.<p>In other words, two of the three security goals that you mentioned are not addressed in any meaningful way by Bitcoin, and the one that is addressed still winds up requiring far more energy than is needed for fiat currency.  Even if paper money turns out to be too inefficient, Chaum&#x27;s research in the 80s and 90s showed the world how to create digital cash that simultaneously allows for anonymous payments, prevents double spending, and requires substantially less work to secure than it does to attack (exponentially so, in fact).  The difference, of course, is that Chaum&#x27;s designs all called for a central bank in the system, which you already need with fiat currency.<p>&quot;I&#x27;d be surprised if the energy required to keep billions of ASICs humming is more than the energy required to keep millions of people humming.&quot;<p>The problem is that the number of ASICs that need to be powered on will increase as the attempts to attack Bitcoin increase, until eventually half the energy output of the planet is being devoted to ASICs.  That is not the situation with fiat currency, as noted above.<p>&quot;Further, the fractional reserve system is far from rock solid. It appears to be solid, until a tipping point of confidence is reached, at which point it falls like a house of cards. It&#x27;s the definition of a con game.&quot;<p>Except that the &quot;confidence&quot; is not in the banking system, but in the legal system that supports it.  Fiat currency&#x27;s value stems from tax laws, debt laws, torts, and so forth, and when people talk about &quot;confidence in the government&quot; what they really mean is &quot;confidence in the government&#x27;s ability to enforce the law.&quot;  If you truly lack such confidence, try this:  stop paying your taxes.  As long as people believe that failure to pay their taxes will result in losing their property and freedom, people will continue to demand payment with fiat currency -- the only currency they can use to pay their taxes.  Likewise with people who have to repay loans (you would be insane to issue a loan in a currency that courts do not deal in), people who have been ordered by courts to make certain payments (again, this will be in whatever currency the courts deal in), people who must pay parking tickets, etc., etc., etc.<p>The vast majority of businesses that &quot;accept Bitcoin&quot; are actually accepting fiat currency payments, via a service that exchanges Bitcoin for fiat currency, and only because that allows them to accept electronic payments with lower transaction fees compared to the alternatives.  That is how pervasive the &quot;house of cards&quot; is.",1382543010

Provide good examples and guides to get the practice started. Some avoid a practice because they don&#x27;t know the best way about executing a practice.

Antibiotic resistance is an inevitability regardless of our usage rates - there&#x27;s too much selective pressure for it not to. To co-opt the Red Queen hypothesis slightly, we have to constantly be developing new antibiotics just to keep pace.<p>I suspect this problem will self-correct eventually, with the unfortunate side-effect that the cost of effective antibiotics will skyrocket for awhile.<p>That being said, we&#x27;re obviously not doing ourselves any favors by dispensing them like candy, especially to the agricultural industry. It definitely encourages cycles - Effective antibiotics are rare and therefore profitable so tons of $$ goes into R&D -> Lots of new antibiotics are created -> price goes down because there&#x27;s so many options/patents expire -> Overuse -> Resistance develops quickly and we&#x27;re left with few effective options.",1382542897

In the limit, half the energy output of the entire planet would have to be devoted to Bitcoin for it to remain secure, though I doubt that any economy could sustain such a situation.<p>By comparison maintaining security for paper money requires substantially less energy than attacking paper money, even if you include the energy devoted to fighting theft (the analog of the energy devoted to securing individual Bitcoin wallets).  The energy spent on counterfeiting detection is far lower than the energy needed to counterfeit modern paper money, and Chaum showed the world how to create digital cash that is even more secure against counterfeiting, with security against double spending, and that allows for anonymous transactions, while still requiring far less energy to be spent on security than would be needed to attack the system.<p>So no, there is no hyperbole here.  Bitcoin is a very inefficient system.  It might work in practice, but that does not make it efficient, nor does it even make it an improvement over what we have now.  The only think Bitcoin has going for it is that there is no obvious central authority (I say no <i>obvious</i> central authority because in practice, the Bitcoin developers have as much power over the currency as a central bank -- they can e.g. cause a block chain fork at any time, as they accidentally did a few months ago).",1382541732

My background is more on the sysadmin side, and I think that&#x27;s why I lean heavily toward Passenger in all my Ruby/Rack deployments, despite the availability of hip new app servers available for Ruby apps.<p>The thing that Passenger does exceedingly well is deliver a toolchain that sysadmins will love. FooBarWidget&#x27;s list is very good. Even if you&#x27;re single-tenant, Passenger&#x27;s process management and supervision has worked wonderfully for me. Toolchain, toolchain, toolchain! Passenger comes with utilities like passenger-status and passenger-memory-stats. You can, at a glance, see things like how much memory (true, RSS) an app process is using, or what your queues look like.<p>Another distinction is completeness of the solution. With a lot of other app server solutions, hashing out the finer details are up to you. I don&#x27;t have any experience with Node.js, but with the other Ruby app servers I&#x27;ve tried, you&#x27;re responsible for things like finding/writing your own init script and process supervision.<p>Can I write an init script?

Except that Django&#x27;s components are well integrated with each other and fully tested, and your custom built system won&#x27;t be.",1382540561

For smal sets of data, arrays can easily be faster at search and insertion than hash tables, particularly if the hash function or collision resolution scheme is inefficient.<p>X having a higher growth rate than Y does not mean that Y is unconditionally faster.  It means that there exists some problem size <i>n</i> such that Y is faster than X for all problems larger than <i>n</i>.

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair that he places blame on the the engineers for failing to convince NASA management to stop the launch. It is possible that better designed slides would have helped NASA management grasp the problem. But I think the fault is more so on them.<p>The premise of &quot;failing to convince management&quot; relies on the notion that &quot;management can do no wrong&quot;. For example, if you tell your boss that we&#x27;re about to drive the bus off a cliff, and he doesn&#x27;t listen, it&#x27;s your fault.<p>This is the way things work in many organizations, it&#x27;s an old-school approach to management, but to me it is purely dysfunctional. When someone tells me I&#x27;m about to drive off a cliff, I say, &quot;Wow, thanks! What did I fail to see that got us into this mess in the first place?&quot;<p>Aside from Tufte&#x27;s notion of blame, I think his essay is very instructive.",1454471782

Think secondary market-makers, institutional investors, healthcare insurers. Not quite rocket control systems or firmware for dialysis machines but five-nines is a given.<p>Bugs happen everywhere. That&#x27;s an axiom. You can decrease the risk of it with formally verifying the system (see: SPARK for Ada), but they&#x27;ll occur. The difference is the what <i>in response to</i> those bugs. ASP.NET on Oracle 11g  might cost a few hundred thousand a year in support contracts alone, but when the bugs occur there is an insurance policy (literally-- at that level, there&#x27;s an SLA and everything), professional liability insurance, and legal recourse. Those ecosystems have had 1: time to mature so those previous bugs that customers have identified and reported have been resolved, and 2: the option to pay (a lot of money, I&#x27;ll admit) to have any new bugs resolved almost immediately. I was working with a large healthcare provider and some how a bug made it through 3 rounds of QA into production. Within <i>6 hours</i> 3 engineers who worked on that specific component had flown across the country, landed, got in my car and was driven to our office, <i>while another team was simultaneously Remote Desktop&#x27;ing</i> to see if they could resolve it in the process. Microsoft still offers LTS for a 13 year old operating system.<p>I&#x27;m not ragging on node.js - its endemic of any new technology with a lot of fervor. In fact, it very much reminds me of the CL community in the late 1990s where everyone was writing a ton of solutions, submitting their packages which worked very well for their own purposes, but broke the second you tried to do something it wasn&#x27;t meant to. It would break and you&#x27;d be on a mailing list back-and-forth&#x27;ing for two or three weeks.<p>A large amount of code is in use which hasn&#x27;t had to stand the test of time (which flushes out a) the poorly designed solutions and b) the bugs in &quot;good&quot; solutions). To make matters worse, and no one knows which is going to be around in 5 years (i.e. what <i>is</i> &quot;good&quot;?) so it&#x27;s all a gamble where no one quite what to put their money on (should I pick Knockout? Angular? oh wait now it&#x27;s all about isomorphic code..should I use Redux or Flux?).",1454471596

But as I&#x27;ve gotten older that kind of intense experience just doesn&#x27;t have the same appeal.  One thing my friends and I have discovered is the pleasantness of micro-dosing.  Put 1 tab of acid in 4 tablespoons of water, mix it a bit, let it sit for 10 minutes, and then each person takes a tablespoon.  In about 45 minutes it comes on but it&#x27;s not strong at all.  No hall of mirrors effect, no out-of-control feeling, just 4 hours of laughing and a heightened sense of being in tune with your surroundings.  Highly recommended.",1454470229

It is performed by reading the binary number from left to right, doubling if the next bit is zero, and doubling and adding one if the next bit is one.[4] In the example above, 11110011, the thought process would be: &quot;one, three, seven, fifteen, thirty, sixty, one hundred twenty-one, two hundred forty-three,&quot; the same result as that obtained above.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_dabble#Historical"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_dabble#Historical</a>",1454470178

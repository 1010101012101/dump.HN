Different research models pose different incentives.<p>To oversimplify and generalize a lot here, I'll describe my understanding of one model, The fundamental to applied research chain,<p>Fundamental research is discovery, to evolve vague notions into concrete ideas and data. It is a broad, generally undirected investigation into some phenomena.<p>Applied research, on the other hand, takes the concrete ideas and data (knowledge) gained from fundamental research and turn them into tangible products (physical such as medicine and virtual, such as search engines).<p>With fundamental research, we get ideas, but not products.<p>With applied research, we get products from ideas.<p>Without fundamental research, there can be no applied research.<p>Without applied research, we get no products.<p>Yes, that is a broad generalization and disregards the true overlap of different research techniques, but I think breaking things out like this can help discover better models and financial motivations for research.<p>To me, it seems that the public sector is more naturally suited toward fundamental research and the private sector is more naturally suited to applied research.",1252169804

806738,comment,806563,806589,0,0,timr,,,"Exactly.  It's sad that the #1 rated comment right now is some ridiculous <i>non sequitur</i> about sex, when there are some pretty glaring holes in Cuban's logic.<p>First off, the value proposition:  Cuban is clearly intensely interested in getting this done, because it might be valuable to his company <i>someday</i>.  Paraphrased, his argument is that it's not guaranteed to be valuable today, so he shouldn't have to pay anyone to do it.  He wants the value, but he doesn't want to pay for it.  That's exploitation, no matter how much he tries to sugar-coat it.<p>Second, the notion of ""experience"" being valuable:  if it's true that the work being offered is <i>worthless</i> to Mark Cuban's company, then the intern isn't working for the Dallas Mavericks.  She's at best doing something <i>tangentially related</i> to the Mavericks, and hoping that Mark Cuban or his organization will give her a good recommendation someday for doing it.  The value proposition to the intern is, at best, debatable, and worse, the intern is in a position where she must excel in an unpaid position to gain any value at all.  The best you can say about it is that it's ethically slimy.<p>Third, internships have inherent value to the employer -- they're <i>extended interviews for paying jobs</i>.  That's why so many tech companies pay summer salaries and perks to college kids;  they want to recruit good employees, <i>cheaply</i>.  Cuban completely disregards this notion.<p>Fourth, Cuban grants that the internship has some probability of value to the Mavericks.  Thus, the internship has some expected value to the organization.  Cuban's argument that the internship has no value is just wrong.  Companies routinely hire interns with no concrete expectations about their productivity, because the expectation of value is higher than the cost of a few interns.  I'm highly skeptical of any counterargument that this wouldn't also be the case for the Dallas Mavericks.<p>In short, there are any number of logical holes in Cuban's argument, but the HN conversation is featuring a conversation about sex and individual liberty instead of discussing the topic at hand.",1252169279

What does it matter if the firm is for profit or not for profit/charity/government agency in the first place?

806689,comment,806563,806596,0,0,akeefer,,,"I'll take a crack at justifying it.<p>First of all, if you have a minimum wage law (which we do), it has to be enforced.  Allowing people to work as ""unpaid interns"" is a half-assed way that corporations take to work around that law.  You can argue about the efficacy of minimum wage laws, but it seems like real empirical studies (instead of just theoretical arguments) have been pretty inconclusive.  And overall, the point is that you can't just let people create a massive loophole in that law by just deciding not to pay people at all.<p>Secondly, from a simple ethical standpoint, unpaid internships privilege people who are already well enough off to be able to give their labor away for free (i.e. generally middle-class or wealthier kids whose parents can support them).  You don't get a lot of poor kids applying for unpaid internships at age 20 or 22 because, guess what, they need those 40+ hours a week to actually earn an income.  So the tradition of unpaid internships in certain traditionally white-collar industries tends to be a subtle form of class discrimination.<p>And recasting it as a ""volunteer"" thing is also a total cop-out:  you volunteer for a non-profit charity, not a for-profit corporation.",1252167403

Price floors (e.g. minimum wage) result in surpluses, price ceilings (e.g. rent control) result in shortages.<p>From an employer's perspective it's easy to see that the more you pay the more interest you'll get from those who can perform work better.  The idea that employers would naturally exploit their workers is a bit silly given the ability for those workers to look elsewhere.  And they do - which is why real wages have risen substantially over time (capturing some of the value in productivity improvements) to the point that in many cases entry level/effective minimum wages greatly exceed legislated minimum wage.  The idea however that government should impose a choice means higher costs on society - in this case borne by the lowest wage earners as they are the ones who are least employable for whatever reason (by definition), means that fewer get hired.<p>And thus you get examples like this: <a href=""http://www.seattlepi.com/opinion/153901_unemploy26.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seattlepi.com/opinion/153901_unemploy26.html</a>",1252167000

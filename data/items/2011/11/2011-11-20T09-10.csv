They also gathered data on every political decision in Latvia from 2009 and can show exactly how each member of parliament votes, coupled with a high number of very interesting statistics.<p>What is even more fascinating is that the first country of choice  Latvia is already well on the way to making such services legally binding. Should the law pass, any online petition with 10,000 or more votes will have to be discussed in the parliament.<p>The team consists of Dmitri Dimitrijev, Armands Leimanis, Eriks Remess, Patrick Schneider-Sikorsky, Konstantinos Anagnostopoulos, Kirils Solovjovs, Vitalijs Gaicuks and Andrejs Jurcenoks. With their plan to introduce wiki-like collaboration and to maybe even start a political party, this project is the one to watch in the coming year.<p>Contact: Dmitri Dimitrijev

You have your own ideas of what's right and wrong, and so do all other employees. Employees have a lot to say about what's going to happen.<p>2. Corporate management is often criticized for short-sightness and destroying shareholder value for their own benefit. This, and ""the shareholder profit is holy"" cannot be true at the same time. :)<p>3. Some corporations give shareholders little or no voice in governance (e.g. Google). The courts historically (per Plamiter's book) give the management benefit of the doubt in any ambiguous situation, and only slap the management down when it's clear they act against shareholder interests. Management has <i>huge</i> leeway. Further, corporate charter can be written such that profit motive is not the primary goal.<p>To the extent that a corporation behaves exclusively like a profit-seeking device, it does so on the consensus of the stakeholders, not due to its inherent nature.<p>If I may offer an analogy, American expansionism in the Middle East, is not an inherent property of a republican democracy, but only of this particular one, given to how interests of stakeholders (including foreign stakeholders) have balanced out.",1321781333

Now I just tell them to call geek squad so that when they get a bill that costs them more than a new computer they think twice about taking us professional power users for granted. I don't think that their time is more valuable than mine in any way but they certainly seem to think so when they bring these antiquated machines to me and think that I am going to spend 4 hours fixing an OS infected with butt-sex viruses I call the 'AIDS of puterz' instead of the 30 minutes it should take me if they were to have a modern machine.  Just the sight of one of these A-holez on my caller ID or now in my contact list coming up on the screen of my micro-powered hand held computer from hell (T-Mobile G2x running Cyanogen 7.1.0.1 MOD coupled with the Trinity kernel that let's me overclock the sucker just for phun and on the phly to 1560 Mhz PER CORE!!!) Oh yeah!....Just the sight of them coming up on that little powerhouse of a tri-corder that just also happens to make phone calls makes me want to wretch!<p>NOW ONTO FLASH.....as you can see we are all 'skilled' and have deep roots in microprocessing love and many of you might even have more history than I but not very many of you trust me... I used to run BBS's back in the early 80's with my PORTABLE Commodore 64-SX computer with an IEEE 8 bit bus HBA jacked into my cartidge port so that I could hook up my SPIFFY SET OF 2 1001's SUPER HIGH DENSITY 1MB 5.25"" floppy disk drives... so if you used to log onto COCONET and remember COMPUSERVE and the infamous ARMOR PLATED CARTRIDGE PORTS (one left and one right) of an Atari 800 that you played your first game of 'ULTIMA' wasting hours and days and weeks and months doing Lord British's laundry then you might be worthy of understanding the big picture here... we'll see though...<p>APPLE PURCHASED ADOBE FOR ONE REASON ABOUT 6 or 7 years ago...THEY WANTED TO DISALLOW, PUT THE KABOSH(sp?), PURPOSELY NOT GIVE SUPPORT TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE GOING TO BUY THEIR CRAPPY iDevices and future iPhones they had in their plans of releasing with all of the other crappy iCrapple gear like iPudz and whatever other rotten crAlpples that have yet to fall from the crApple tree of nightmare lipstick on a pig devices that we TRUE and LONG TERM (thus the big into on my credz) SUPER USERz have NEVER BEEN INTERESTED IN FOR ONE REASON AND ONE REASON ONLY!!!  WE HAVE NEVER HAD THE DESIRE OR NEED TO PLAY WITH OVERPRICED YUPPIE TOYZ THAT WERE PROPRIETARY AND CREATED OUT OF PURE GREED AND DECEPTIVE MARKETING IDEAS TO TRY TO FINALLY TURN A PROFIT FOR A COMPANY THAT NEVER MADE A DIME ON THEIR BOTTOM LINE IN OVER 30 YEARS OF EXISTANCE UNTIL THEY STARTED SELLING A STOLEN PATENT BASED DEVICE CALLED AN iPud! Then they gave this iPud thingy the ability to make phone calls and started calling it a SmartPhone...You new people (last ten years) that think you know what the phuk is up....just shut the phuk up on this one because you have no phuking clue and you never will... Ya see new people... crApple Inc. has never invented a god damn thing ever...they have either borrowed (stolen), aquired, or just plain copied everything they have ever done and put a dress on it and then tripled the retail price of anything like it and the crApple subculture continued to bite like a school of freshly hatched guppies (but they were actually old school hipped turned yuppie so now I like to refer to them as YIPPIEz!) the whole time being snobs because they think that unless they didn't overpay and basically get ripped the phuk off that they weren't buying the BEST of the BEST gear.  Well sorry to burst all you crApple wanna be's bubblez but any old school and still way ahead of the curve today geeks out there because of just plain common sense and not because we're wanting to tweak everything all the time would tell you today that they have never owned a crApple product, never had the desire to own or spend a dime on a crApple product and will never purchase a crApple product until the day they die or they can finally afford to buy that $HIT lying company and burn the phuker to the ground and build a memorial in its place in memory of the MAC LISA....(Don't know what that is???? then stop reading this ya jackazz!)<p>So you've gotten this far in my lovely little tale of two worlds...one being the alien lifeform that has recently gained momentum but really has no sustainability because even you recent morons that are calling themselves techie'z are starting to realize that crApple SUX! always did, always will, and you got taken! So you made it this far?  Well there is not that far to go for you to read why I am writing all of this first... so here it is!!!  crApple Inc. purchased ADOBE so that they could purposely NOT GIVE TO THEIR IGNORANT DEVICE OWNERz the ability to watch the majority of VIDz out there on the internet but especially from YOUTUBE!!! Guess why or already know why? BECAUSE DUMMY, simple deal...it's owned by GOOGLE and GOOGLE is going to take over the entire planet...and this phuking geek is okay with it.  Okay with it because Micro$oft is almost as bad as crApple in their bull$hit deceptive everything and GOOGLE and I have been in bed with each other for over 8 years of smartphone love. I have been using their PHREEEEEE everything even before my same day it was released to the public aquisition of the G1. THE VERY FIRST GOOGLE PHONE...keep it safe if you still have one people because some day it's going to be worth a fortune when it's inducted into the Smithsonian Institute of Science as the VERY 1ST GOOGLE HARDWARE DEVICE EVER!!! GOOGLE preys on the companies and advertisers that prey on you...Micro$oft Inc. and crApple Inc. PERY ON YOU! The device or product owner themself! I have never directly (read that again...DIRECTLY) given GOOGLE one thin dime of money and yet I use all of their products and services for PHREEEEEEE 20 times a day...however...when I first set up my PHREEEEEE GOOGLE VOICE account appx three years ago when it was still INVITATION ONLY! I also set up my GOOGLE CHECKOUT and when they verified my debit card account that day they gave me the dime...YEP...and I STILL HAVE ALL .10 CENTS BITCHEz! When I look at my GOOGLE VOICE VOICEMAIL TO TEXT TRANSCRIPTS using their widget (Don't worry about what a widget is crApple people because you don't have them) I always see my account balance at the bottom and it still says "".10"" and its even colored in GREEEEEEEEEEN!  awwwww....a nice touch.... so crApple Inc. valuable...?? NOPE, nothing about them adds anything valuable to your life...just more debt, deceptive advertising and marketing, half truths, only one part of the REAL story, and most important YOU the crApple device owner is now imprisoned into your little crApple trendy fad driven world and will be left with your little crApple dikz out when this bull$hit is over!",1321780715

3257677,comment,3256748,3257644,6,0,rayiner,,,"> I disagree. If someone doesn't pursue their own interests then by logical necessity they are pursueing interests imposed on them.<p>If you read the text surrounding the quoted language, it uses ""own interest"" in a narrow sense, not encompassing altruism. If you subscribe to the notion that there is a dichotomy between ""own interest"" (encompassing altruism) and ""the state's interest"" then yes your claim is logically valid, but also besides the point. The ethic underlying modern American business ethics conceives that profit maximization maximizes overall social welfare (i.e. it uses the narrower definition of ""own interest"" that Smith uses, not your broader definition).<p>>  Of course, by disagreeing with that you would prove my point that ""social responsibility"" is anything but a completely subjective term that varies (greatly) by each individual, and only has power in the context of the State.<p>Guess what? We live in a state. And we live in a state where most people believe in welfare maximization: the greatest good for the greatest number. And many of those people, in the business context, believe that profit maximization leads to welfare maximization. To the extent that this assumption is incorrect, their behavior is inconsistent with their desired outcomes.<p>> But what does social obligation mean? If you didn't obligate yourself, then social obligation really means obligation by force, obligation to the State and whatever the State deems an obligation.<p>You obligate yourself by participating in civilized society. You obligate yourself by exchanging, for the protections of civilized society, the duties of living in a civilized society. You try to separate ""the State"" from ""the people"" but in reality ""we the people"" created ""the State"" to defend our property interests. ""We the people"" through ""the State"" keep big strong men from taking what you conceive of as ""your property"" and that obligates you to us.<p>That obligation doesn't necessarily have to involve coercion. To the extent that you don't consider how your business decisions impact society at large, it might simply make you a ""bad person."" The problem is that we have an ethical system that relieves you of the duty to make that consideration. You can ruthlessly try to maximize shareholder value and still be a ""good person."" That ethic is predicated on the idea that profit maximization ultimately serves to maximize social welfare. What I'm arguing is that this assumption has been empirically invalidated (or at least drastically limited) and as such we should move towards an ethic that labels people who are socially inconsiderate as ""bad people.""",1321779882

Indeed, it really is the other way around, and it will never be otherwise, but it doesn't change the fact that some of your paying customers will be dissatisfied by your service to the point that they will take action to bypass your own faulty distribution channel, and they will even pay to be able to do that.<p>Heck, let's drop the masks, the majority of your paying customers even bought their very first computer just to be able to do that over the past decade.<p>I'm not advocating piracy, I'm explaining why it exists in the first place. When the pirated product is available immediately instead of months/years later, and with better features than the legit one, it's foolish to expect even paying fans not to pirate things nor look into piracy as a distribution channel. This is a challenge that content distributors need to deal with, one way or another.<p>Saying that people shouldn't pirate digital goods because it's illegal is all nice and well, but is this even enforceable? It's my own humble belief that it's not, not with the current state of the art, and that yelling at piracy is like yelling at windmills.

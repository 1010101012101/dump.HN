The consultancy side produces a lot of documents (specs, quotes, reports, etc.) Sometimes we write these collaboratively with the customer. Then we use Word. When we write them on our own we use Latex. We use XeLatex for pretty fonts and the very flexible memoir class. We have a standard template all our docs use. Latex is so much more productive than Word, due to abstraction, easy VCS integration, and living in our text editors.",1326351484

3455342,comment,3452912,3455156,4,0,johngunderman,,,"> I guess the problem is that you added a bunch of strangers to Google+. That's not what Google+ is for.<p>Google+ is a social network. As such, I have a hard time imagining that it can be successful by forcing users to use it in a specific way. If the people using the service want to leverage the service in a certain way, there doesn't seem to be anything ""wrong"" with that. In fact, I'd argue that Google should take such usage as feedback into improving the service to better incorporate the new usage patterns.<p>EDIT: This perhaps should go as it's own comment, but I'm going to throw it here for the time being:<p>People like to use social networks as a public publishing platform as well as a way to share with friends. This is to some extent supported by Google, as they have encouraged people to use G+ as a blogging platform. The behavior we see with the HN circle is (I'd argue) just people attempting to hack functionality onto public side of G+, which IMHO is a part of G+ that is sorely lacking.",1326351401

I know the current trend this month is to hate on GoDaddy because of it being Reddits cause of the week regarding SOPA, but in reality a large company such as this can't prevent this type of infringement due to it's customers acting in bad faith in an automated fashion. To enforce this programatically I think would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, hence why SOPA is a terrible bill. :)",1326349790

The best Javascript compression implementation I could find by Googleing around was lzw, which due to the way it steps through the data and builds the dictionary is inherently inefficient, never mind that it compresses to an array which can only be stored as far as I know as text delineated by commas which tends to increase size. So I wrote one that analyzes and prioritizes the dictionary before applying compression, and doesn't need a dictionary to be predefined like lzw does, which is necessary for one of my use cases.<p>I wasn't going for ""I'm a compression expert"", I was just going for ""Look at my latest weekend project"" and ""here's a code sample.""<p>The decision to name it after me was a hard one, but I figured namespacing my projects would prevent me from using up all the good ones.<p>I should also emphasize that I have no idea if this particular algorithm already exists somewhere, I've only looked at a few compression schemes. Didn't mean to invent, just wanted to solve my particular JSON problem with client-side compression and get data smaller than I could achieve with existing libraries.",1326349752

SOPA should be immediately halted with extreme prejudice and the real issues should be thoroughly reconsidered in an open forum with policy makers, entrepreneurs, experts, and citizens working together to create a legitimate policy that is levelheaded and forward thinking.

I&#x27;ve been despairing over something lately.<p>I&#x27;ve poured the last four years into a CS PhD and am about to graduate. I don&#x27;t intend to take an academic position. I applied to a few companies, but none called back.<p>I have a background many geeks share: coding from an early age, spending their teenage years in IRC soaking up everything, playing, hacking. When I finished high school, I went into CS, where I met my future advisor. He suggested I apply as a PhD so he could fund me. I wasn&#x27;t aware then that PhD meant &quot;professor in training&quot;, nor that the university I&#x27;d go to has a reputation for producing bad grads. It seemed like a good opportunity, so I took it.<p>My advisor put me to work solo on developing a large system that would be the foundation for a (possibly commercial) web service. I saw this project through from the ground up. I got to experiment with different technologies. I made a habit of writing clean code/documentation. All in all, a lot of valuable experience.<p>People fresh out of academia are typically some of the worst software developers imaginable, doubly so for those with no job experience. I don&#x27;t feel like I meet the stereotype, but looking at my resume you can&#x27;t tell. My advisor discouraged internships, and nothing I&#x27;ve done outside of academia is worth putting in a resume.<p>I feel like I&#x27;m trapped. I&#x27;m overqualified, yet have no work experience. The only thing I <i>am</i> qualified for is an academic job I don&#x27;t want. Now I&#x27;m about to be without income.<p>The companies I&#x27;ve applied to are all big, though I think I&#x27;d fit well in an early-stage startup where I could take on a generalist role. But I feel like such a position takes connections I don&#x27;t have. Could I approach the founders at such a company directly?

9055345,comment,9052925,9054924,0,0,dillondf,,,"No, nobody is magicking up any fairy dust here.  The author (which is me) is looking at things realistically.  My maintenance costs just from a time perspective are already radically lower.<p>In anycase, so as long as the SSD is powered and thus able to rewrite blocks as bits start to go bad (creating some wear in the process but not a whole lot compared to normal operation), the actual data will be retained for significantly longer than 10 years.<p>Unpowered data retention (where there is nothing there checking for and rewriting blocks whos bits start to go bad) depends on cell wear.  I didn&#x27;t pull up the chip specs but my recollection is that it is 10 years for new cells and 1-2 years for a relatively worn cell.  Depends on temperature of course.  That means I can pull a SSD and shelve it without too much worry for a relatively long time, something that cannot be said for any hard drive.<p>CD&#x27;s corrode from the inside out, primarily due to air trapped in the holes I believe.  Even though it is laser burned there is no real care taken in constructing the plastic sides or metal film to keep up air so when it gets vaporized the oxygen sticks around and starts corroding the metal.  Or the plastic gets fuzzy from UV exposure or age.  Totally different ballgame.<p>Hard drives have even worse problems if left unpowered.  I used to pull backup drives and shelve them, but their life spans are radically lowered if left unpowered on a shelf for 6 months and then replugged into a machine at a later time.  I&#x27;m sure some HDD expert can say why.  So I stopped doing that.  Now the backup drives stay powered on 24x7.<p>Hard drives seem to have a limited life span whether you use them or not.  I have tons of old HDDs sitting around, some well over 20 years old in fact.  If I plug an old HDD in I can sometimes read the data off before the whole thing turns into a brick.  I mostly use them to test disk driver error handling.<p>SSDs left sitting around can always be reformatted (i.e. just using TRIM to clean out the whole thing then start writing to it fresh).  Their wear limit is based on rewrite cycles rather than how long they&#x27;ve been sitting around.  HDDs are physically destroyed, you don&#x27;t get a fresh start by reformatting an old HDD.<p>-Matt",1424061898

Unfortunately, and it&#x27;s a rather big minus, Rethink doesn&#x27;t have a planner, and every index has to be specified explicitly. This puts a burden on the application, which needs to be completely index-aware.<p>Where it really does break down is on aggregations. On a 800k dataset of semi-complex documents, the query &quot;select x, count(*) from y group by x&quot; (x here is a string with a cardinality of 89) took 4 seconds with Postgres, 84 seconds with Rethink on a test box.<p>In this scenario, Postgres was actually running in a slow Virtualbox VM, whereas Rethink was running natively; on our production servers, the same query takes about 500ms. In this scenario, Rethink used about 6GB out of the 8GB of memory allocated to it, whereas Postgres just streams the data through the FS cache -- so I think Rethink is just using a really bad query strategy.<p>Rethink&#x27;s benefit, of course, is horizontal scaling, and it&#x27;s supposed to be able to parallelize reads. But it has to work for the types of queries you give it. I strongly advise looking at your application&#x27;s query needs, importing some test data, and seing how they perform.

Think of it as &quot;RSS at the speed of Twitter&quot;.<p>Basically, I want URLs to be handles and self-hosted blogs to be posts. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out the federation aspect, but aggregators could scan domains for lists of users by checking &quot;johndoe.name/microblog.json&quot;, or there could be a centralized server with a list of aggregators.<p>If microblog.json exists, it contains a list of users&#x27; URLs, and each of those is a list of posts. Each post has a short, less-than-140-character summary, and it may have a longer version. The aggregator can decide how to display short vs. long, but I&#x27;m imagining having the summary be clickable, and then the full text will roll into view.<p>The aggregation server otherwise functions a lot like Twitter.

This is the concept of a computer simulation always invoked by the popular media whenever this subject comes up.<p>The second one, which is what scientists usually mean, is an actual simulation that merely runs the basic processes of physics from which all the other things in the universe emerge - and these include accidentally, among other things and quite marginally, intelligent life forms such as humans. It&#x27;s merely an uncaring physics simulation indistinguishable from a &quot;natural&quot; universe.<p>In the end both of these are scientifically barren concepts. The Matrix is an implausible just-so story with quasi-religious undertones, and it&#x27;s a concept that exhibits quite a few glaring holes the closer you look at its practical implications - holes which seem like they are in disagreement with daily observation and hence should lend themselves to falsification. The cold physics simulation on the other hand, while it doesn&#x27;t share the intellectual weaknesses of the Matrix, gets us rapidly to a point where we might ask what difference it makes at all whether the fabric of reality is running on an artificial or &quot;natural&quot; substrate if there is no hope of ever finding out.",1424061482

They have fewer new markets to reach and less segments to expand into. Probably the only big financial upside they have is in cutting legacy print costs.<p>Of course, this same growth-based analysis also applies to Facebook/Twitter vs Google. They&#x27;re both much younger businesses than Google and presumably have lots of growth available in both users and advertising effectiveness. Google, on the other hand, has been selling ads since before Facebook even existed. Thus, it&#x27;s easy to make a case for Google having reached it&#x27;s peak while Facebook has room left to grow.<p>Also, any analysis which conflates newsroom uniques with service users is basically useless. The average content &quot;unique user&quot; reads a few articles a month (if you&#x27;re lucky), but the average user of a service like Facebook logs in multiple times a week. This is one of the key reasons that VCs prefer technology companies to media: users have much more of a regular relationship with their users.

You said, &#x27;it is overwhelmingly likely that whatever the “most elementary” controllable aspect of reality is, be it strings or something else, it will be able to encode at most a single bit per thing.&#x27; What if more variables were considered when deriving meaning from an electron? For example, Up means 1, Down means 0, and the position of that 1/0 relative to other 1s and 0s provides further info, or the time between transitions between 0 and 1 provides further info. Could a single electron then store information about more than 1 elementary particle?",1424060469

The rules are all known, but they are not evaluated until needed.  If we have one single person, how hard would it be to simulate every single input to that one person?

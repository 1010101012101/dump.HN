The logic behind that seems to be ... that scaling in memory usage is important but not CPU usage?  I'm not really a Java apologist, but it just seems another one of those languages that people bash because it's cool to bash.",1223225871

We have been doing a lot of research with high altitude balloons and we used these to create a mesh network between the balloons so that we could sync the data and get a more 3-dimensional view of the various measurements that we were taking. It worked perfectly on the ground, but a few of the devices had communication problems at high altitude. This was almost certainly a fault of higher levels of radiation and increased distance between the equipment than any flaw in the devices themselves. Overall, they are a very handy product.",1223225700

324168,comment,324074,324151,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I always (well, recently) thought it was because of discrete marginal utility functions.<p>For most people, the material difference between making $600/month or $570/month isn't much.  You're still poor.  You might get to splurge on one more restaurant meal a month, but that won't make you feel any richer.<p>The difference between having $0 in the bank and $60M in the bank is enormous, however.  You've gone from poor to rich, and can do whatever you want with your life.<p>So for most people, the tradeoff is between certain poverty or a very small chance of escaping poverty.  Squares with the article, too: by making people ""feel poor"", they were highlighting the contrast between their present life and the life they would have if they won the lottery.",1223225355

When American tech workers think of ""immigrant"" it is very probable they interpret that as ""some guy who is better than me, works longer hours, requires less pay, and has no capacity for laziness or stupidity thanks to his brainy robot genes, who is going to steal my job"". Americans, on average, are honestly probably lazier, less educated, and demand higher pay than their foreign-born counterparts, but I am pulling that out of my ass so feel free to cry foul on me.",1223225128

324163,comment,323863,324157,0,0,jgalvez,,,"Which leads me to point that out that Java is far from suitable for a start-up. I'm beginning to think that Python plus C/C++ might be the golden bullet for startups. Ruby's C integration is easier than Python, but there's something to be said about the overall language model and performance. I tend to have a main RoR app for the website and a few Python daemons in the background for the really heavy stuff, and now it's finally the time to think about offloading some of that load even further closer to the machine, in C/C++.<p>I'd really love to come up with a standardized way of deploying small, context-specific RESTful API servers in either C or C++. I'm starting to think that a possible C++/Python bridge via Thrift is likely the best option. But then again, if I just managed to keep it all in a C++ application without needing to run the Python interpreter, it could totally rock (for an application that is supposed to serve 100k+ users on cheap hardware).<p>It's cool to see cloud computing going mainstream and now applications written in any language can be reasonably fast with the help of EC2, a load  balancer and memcached. But I still think there's great value to coming up with truly lightweight solutions that really use nearly all computing power a single node can possibly offer.",1223224425

324153,comment,323752,324100,0,0,nihilocrat,,,"Ok, I'm calling foul here. I had a friend who was trying to buy some new RAM for his older system. He is not super-nerdy so he took the RAM stick to Best Buy to see if they sold a similar module, or could at least tell him what sort of RAM it is. The Geek Squad guy took a look at the module, noticed that it was old, and immediately gave him a pitch about buying a new computer. The the PC platform has arguably a better set of tools and third party components out there to make more use out of old equipment, but Best Buy is still a company that sells computers, and thus make the most money by convincing people to throw out their old systems.<p>It ended up being an RDRAM module and thus could only realistically be found online, but people who are trying to upgrade an old system don't appreciate being given a sales pitch, especially if, god forbid, they are poor.",1223223393

There is a chance that they might never deliver (you're the only one in a position to estimate this).<p>Think of it in terms of an equity investment.  If they invest $X on a $Y premoney valuation, they own X/(X+Y) of the company.  After the investment, the company then pays partners based on contributions (e.g. it pays you a salary and pays them sales commissions based on success - or any other means you choose.).",1223222836

Before that, this is some temporary instability, this is an important time, don't you trust me, it's coming, we're waiting on the lawyers, that language is boilerplate, this is how the business works, you don't understand the nuances, etc.<p>Stop listening to what they say, look at what they do. Either they do or do not produce a stock options contract and make good on their other promises -- and I'm sure there have been a few that have been delayed ""for now"", right? And I bet that either this company has the founder, one or two of his very old buddies, you, and maybe another worker or two - or there's the founder, his buds, and a 1-3 dozen people with 95% turnover every few months.<p>Your founder sounds like a sociopath, someone who lacks a conscience and will say anything they think they can get away with manipulate people into doing what they want. Read the book The Sociopath Next Door, it's a decent intro (skip the bunk ""origins of conscience"" chapter) - until you realize they literally can't be like a normal person, you'll keep thinking they'll make good on their promises and the golden future they've described will arrive.<p>I worked at a startup owned by a sociopath for most of a year. There were some huge promises and I was excited to be part of it. Except that sometimes the founder was a huge jerk sometimes, except the business didn't feel quite right, except agreements never worked out like I understood they would. I finally realized something was badly wrong when, instead of the long-promised stock options, they offered employees the opportunity to invest their own money in the company. That was fishy enough, and when I went to do it and found out the CEO would hold stock 'in care of' employees. Just a legal formality, the lawyers said it had to be this way for anyone investing under $X. When a few folks asked about investing more than $X, they were privately told a different reason they personally had to accept this assignment scheme to buy in. The company was all  friendly and nice (unless you wanted promises fulfilled, then you'd get pulled into the stairwell or out into the parking lot and yelled at until you were back in line) but nothing ever quite seemed to happen as promised for reasons that were plausible on their face.<p>So take stock: what's happened as promised? I see in other comments you haven't been paid, that puts you in a great negotiating position as you own the copyright to everything you've built. But this isn't some bump in the road you'll fix and get on with: as soon as they have copyright you won't be a team player, you'll be canned, your options will be revoked by subclause 2.4.c(iii), they'll hire some . Have your lawyer draft an agreement that you give them copyright when a check for $X clears, and find a good startup or start your own business. They've been screwing you for a year to great effect, why would they change strategy?",1223222713

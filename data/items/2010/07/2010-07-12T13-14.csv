Also, my wife would be 100% happy with me being (effectively) clean shaven all the time.  Stubble is much less welcome.<p>Unfortunately I've started to get grey patches, and laser removal is less effective on grey hair.

It doesn't have to do a great deal to be useful - perhaps it would just show the RSS feed from your school events society. Maybe it would just make a ping sound when you touched the screen, or be a really simple game just for the fun of it.<p>If we are talking about 15 minutes of setup and build time then the apps really don't have to do much, and they only have to be useful to one person to get made. But it makes owning the phone much more interesting to people who are a bit geeky but don't code, which is important for Google.<p>(Compare to the iPhone - where the easiest option is to set up a web server and build a single-purpose web site.

1507734,comment,1507661,1507661,0,0,edanm,,,"A few random thoughts, as I write them. Disclaimer: after looking it over, I'm not really interested in using the product (right now, at least), I'm talking about the process up to that realization.<p>* The design of the front page itself is nice and pretty in general. Having said that, there are a few problems.<p>* The initial pitch is clear (make pretty graphs), the first two questions I had were ""so what does this software look like"" and ""what would I use this for"".<p>* To answer the second question, I clicked on the big ""Blogger"" button. For some reason, the text <i>above</i> it was updated, totally not what I was expecting (and I was close to missing it completely). I'd change that.<p>* The text ""Click on the red button to sign up for a free beta account."" is kind of superfluous. I'd remove it, the button is pretty self-explanatory).<p>* At this point I would normally just close the tab, since the three points you made for bloggers didn't seem too interesting. But I kept looking, and:<p>* Apparently, you can click on ""Learn More"". <i>This</i> page has most of the stuff I was looking for on the front page, like a video showing the software, and larger explanations on what it's good for.<p>* I would either make the Learn More button stand out much more, or (even better) put its content on the home page. Also, I'd put a ""home"" button next to the ""Learn More"" button and have it highlighted, to make it clearer that it's a ""tabbing interface"" and not just background noise.<p>* If you're putting the video on the front page, I would tweak it a little to make it more focused on showcasing the actual software (skip the whole login process, just get to where data becomes graphs).<p>Anyways, those are my quick first thoughts. Definitely looks interesting, but I'm guessing your hardest challenge will be to convince people they should use your software instead of Excel, all the more reason to put a video showcasing why your software is better smack-dab on the front page.<p>Best of luck to you on your startup!",1278942171

You shouldn't really need an additional page to explain your service though.<p>Whats your nearest competitor? Guess its like, Excel? What are the pain points there and how do you solve them awesomely?<p>The blogger/student/designer links are too subtle, it isn't clear what they update. (eg: scroll down 20% and click them - nothing happens)<p>There is probably too much text. Try stripping out all the detail for each benefit (eg: Works with popular data formats) and have a simple bullet list of every feature. maybe tapping them shows more information regarding them to the right.<p>Chances are different people care about different features, it might be clever to reorganize bullet points based on what role they tap, eg: designers might care about themes, academics about latex, marketeer about pdfs.<p>From a design point of view I think the site looks nice, the logo at the top is maybe too high and pushes your content down 75px too much, the buttons are quite ugly. The twitter button stands out a bit too much and the free sign up button doesn't really pop - I like green for primary CTA.<p>The 6 examples of visualisations aren't clear and feel like I should click them and a light box will pop up showing an example.<p>the sign up page needs some polish. make the fonts consistent, change the heading from ""Pretty Graph Basic Account Beta"" to ""Pretty Graph Registration"" or some such. Scrap the line about the pricing, capture the data then tell them. When i clicked ""sign up"" it redirected me to a 403 for /users.<p>The ""Creating account"" text is too obscure, it should probably be a spinner, a nice rule of thumb is that if you need a spinner - do it faster.<p>i just accidentally reloaded, so i'll give more feedback in 15 minutes when the page has returned ;)<p>disclaimer: i am math retarded and charts confuse me. i do however know a thing or two about product messaging/marketing (IMHO)",1278942140

1507700,comment,1507107,1507107,0,0,JangoSteve,,,"I fail to see his point as to why the site would need to maintain a low PageRank. The only time he even addresses that point is with the following:<p><i>By purposefully maintaining a low ranking site, which has good on-page SEO (titles and headings), you can create a regular stream of small posts relevant to your subject matter, without having to create extensive, high-effort articles that your site/brand is known for.</i><p>But how does the PageRank of the site <i>change</i> your intentions for the type of posts you write? I would have just played it off as trying to make the post more popular by giving it a counter-intuitive theme, but then at the end of the post, he writes:<p><i>...please don’t link to it! It needs to maintain a low ranking to serve its original purpose.</i><p>So unless I'm misunderstanding, it sounds like he's saying, create a site full of trivial posts, but make sure that it maintains a low PageRank, so that it doesn't become popular and hurt your brand.<p>Why would it hurt your brand? Because you're not actually contributing anything useful. But if you're not contributing anything useful, then no one will link to it.*<p>The corollary is that if a lot of people link to it, you must actually be providing something useful.

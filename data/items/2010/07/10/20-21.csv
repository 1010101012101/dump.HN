Look at the requirements, and if MS is the 'best', use them.  But... the 'best' definition needs to be clear at all levels, and understood by everyone involved.<p>My argument for migrating towards more Linux/opensourceness would be one of 'keep the money local'.  Especially in the early stages of a migration, there may in fact be a short term increase in spending, to find local talent to train and  reprogram systems.  After the initial transition, the need for fewer license renewals can be substantial.<p>Assuming there wasn't 100% reduction in licensing costs.  Let's say there was a 60% reduction in licensing costs, but in reality that became only 70% because of increased training, customization and programming costs.  You've saved 30% but also kept more money flowing in the UK economy.<p>At some point, stuff need to be paid for.  You can choose to hire local consultants and companies who use MS tools, meaning you're paying for local talent and paying license fees over to an US-based company.  Or you can pay local talent to use free technology.<p>Bottom line: You have to pay talent/labor, but you may have more money in the budget to pay more local people to get more done after migrating to free technologies.",1278794570

In a game with no house, this may be true, but in a a game raking, it depends a lot on what sort of players sit down against you.<p>So if you want to put 'table selection' under skill, yes, I'll grant your point, but without judicious picking and choosing in that, poker can very much be a losing game just like most other casino games.<p>Look at the O8 games in Tunica for instance. Dead dead and deader because no one except people on oxygen tanks ever plays them.<p>It takes a <i>lot</i> of confluence of factors to beat the house drain on games (I'm talking in person games, not online games; online games are ""merely"" illegal, but otherwise you'll likely be fine in the longterm).",1278793003

If you have a particular design or interactive needs and there's already a library or component that works in the particuar front-end tech you're looking at (a silverlight charting lib, for example), then it'd probably make sense to use silverlight.  However, that's mostly from a pragmatic cost-only view, nothing to do with the technology qualities itself.<p>From what I recall, Silverlight does make it somewhat easier (compare to Flash) to interact with javascript on a page where the SL app is hosted.  However, javascript interacts with javascript even better.<p>The bigger question to ask, imo, is are there things you can't do in JS that you need to?  If so, use SL/Flex/whatever.  Realize that you're likely limiting the audience somewhat, especially if you're going the Silverlight route.  However, doing cutting edge JS is also going to limit the audience somewhat too, as not everyone is running (or can run) the latest browser versions.<p>FWIW, 3birds, if you're reading this, come on our to our PHP/MySQL meet up next week - we're in Carrboro, and you're in Chapel Hill :)",1278792723

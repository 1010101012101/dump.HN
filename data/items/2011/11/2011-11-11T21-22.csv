I believe that same guide mentions that it may not be the best choice for heavy number crunching.<p>This are two areas where Go has a big advantage over Erlang while providing an equivalent (although slightly different and more CSP-ish) concurrency model.<p>> I also want to mention that in my experience, Erlang applications are pure hell to deploy for people who don't have years of OTP deployment under their belts. So much of having a manageable Erlang app depends on the developers being well versed in a lot of subtle, and very easy to get wrong conventions.<p>Another big contrasts with Go, where you just build a static binary, copy it to any target systems, and run it.",1321048313

They are a promise of future compensation, just like salary, and just like salary you don't receive it if you don't work there anymore. If it was actually a decision of accepting the risk of the stock being valueless, then the compensation would be <i>stock</i> instead of options.<p>> Yes, there is a detail in the agreement that the employer can fire you whenever he wants and retain unvested options<p>No, that is the clause as written, not some sort of sneaky backdoor that they snuck in, it is the very definition of these stock options. The clause doesn't say ""if you are fired for gross negligence or incompetence..."" it says ""If you are not employed here on date X, then you get nothing"".<p>> There is a BIG difference between saying ""Johhny, it's just not working out, please take the options you've earned and move along. You're not needed anymore.""<p>You have earned <i>nothing</i> until they vest! That is the entire point of the structure of these options. If they were actually anything like what you are describing, they would just be monthly stock grants. If you work somewhere for 6 months you don't get half of the grant that you get after 1 year, you get nothing. It is explicitly not proportional in the contract.<p>> ""Johnny, we like you, but we didn't think you'd make this much money, so we kinda wish we hadn't given you as many options. Please give them back or we will forced to fire you as permitted by clause 3.2D in the agreement.""<p>How is this different from ""Johnny, we like you, but we don't think you are worth the $200k salary that we foolishly offered you before. We aren't going to continue paying you such a high salary, so you can either accept the lower salary that we think you deserve or we will fire you""?

And yet that isn't how any RSUs work, because that isn't what they are.<p>Stocks and RSUs or options are not the same thing at all, and to act like they are the same is just crazy.<p>Edit: To be clear, it's perfectly possible that Zynga did something immoral here. They probably did, but that immoral thing was <i></i>claiming that stock options are the same as stock<i></i>,  not using stock options exactly how they are intended to be used. I feel like you are just opening yourself up to being lied to exactly the same if you continue thinking that stock options or RSUs are anywhere near as good as actual stock.<p>You are only opening up future people by arguing the line of argument that you are, because other people will read it and think the reason why this happened is because Zynga was immoral, not because this is a normal risk that is by design part of stock options.

Jeff dismissed the latter in favor of tackling the former, and I think he did rather well. I could see designers instead of paying $500 for Photoshop pay $15/mo to use an online editing service that stores and backs up their photos for them (or syncs with Dropbox). I could see programmers paying a monthly fee to use an online IDE that builds and runs their software against an array of OSes and supports GitHub/Bitbucket. Users are already throwing their music to ""the cloud"" with services like Grooveshark and Pandora.

We've developed an application we use internally for essentially doing distributed, fault-tolerant timers.<p>I, however, would caution against some of the platitudes you use about it being the future of concurrency. I also think it is kind of silly to imply that a coder isn't ""worth their salt"" if they aren't learning Erlang. It isn't a panacea. If you read some modern Erlang guides like Learn You Some Erlang, for example, you'll note that a responsible advocate of Erlang will caution against drinking too much kool-aid. Erlang, for example, is admitted as being a poor choice for lots of string manipulation because of the way strings are implemented in the language. I believe that same guide mentions that it may not be the best choice for heavy number crunching.<p>Developers worth their salt will not just hear the word concurrency and start writing everything in Erlang. It is much better to consider the problem and ensure that the problem domain matches Erlang's particular strengths.<p>I also want to mention that in my experience, Erlang applications are pure hell to deploy for people who don't have years of OTP deployment under their belts. So much of having a manageable Erlang app depends on the developers being well versed in a lot of subtle, and very easy to get wrong conventions. We actually ended up needing to start a support contract with Erlang Solutions themselves to help us demystify getting a sane deployment process going for our app. This was an expensive endeavor. Yes, it was primarily because we were new to the language, but it also had a lot to do with a lack of community documentation/discussion about deployment procedures. I won't even get into the joy of trying to decipher Erlang's famously cryptic crash reports/stack traces.<p>tl;dr: Erlang isn't concurrency pixie dust. A developer isn't a failure if they aren't currently learning it, nor are they a success if they just decide to use Erlang for every class of problem. It is an interesting language to work with and solves certain problems very well, others not so well.",1321045698

We wonder if at the core of every corporation is an empty vessel, an icy void, a dispassionate pursuit of the bigger bottom line.<p>As I mentioned in the post, I think the best brands (and businesses) have a mission that is higher than profit.

So yeah, that partially mitigates the problem.<p>It can still be done, however. But it'll take more than a few minutes, because I have only read about and played with PoCs of the relevant attacks, never implemented one like that myself.<p>One approach is <i>""clickjacking""</i>. It involves putting your page in an IFRAME that is 100% alpha transparent, in a containing page. This is positioned over an image that says ""CLICK TO PLAY"" (or something) in such a way that the (invisible) button on your page aligns with the image. When you click the image, you're actually clicking the button on your site. Javascript in the containing page monitors when this happens and when it does, it can read the CSRF token from the URL that the IFRAME now points to. Once it knows the token, the XSS attack is straightforward.<p>Now this only works because your form submits the CSRF token via a GET request, so I can read it from the URL. If your form would only accept a POST request, I'm not entirely sure of how I'd do it. I need to think about that for a little while longer, it's an interesting challenge, though. There are some (IMO) far-fetched clickjacking-like attacks that require some social engineering (of the containing page) to get the user to perform certain actions that could do it. One way is to wrap a viewsource: URL to your page in an IFRAME (only works in Firefox, afaik) and position and dress it up so that only the CSRF token is visible and it looks like a CAPTCHA. The user would enter the CAPTCHA/CSRF and then XSS is possible. But that's not very elegant, and I'm not entirely sure if Firefox still allows doing this. Also it's not guaranteed to succeed if the user can't be bothered to enter a CAPTCHA to see the cute kitten video.<p>So in that case I'm not sure. One surefire way to prevent these and related clickjacking-style attacks is to put some framebusting JS code in your site. Twitter does this to prevent clickjacking to autosubmit a those pre-filled tweet form. Check their sourcecode, the way they do it is pretty thorough (even taking into account race conditions that might cause the submit click to go through just before the frame is busted).<p>I'm going to have to think about this for a while (how to do it if it were a POST form, that is. I'm fairly sure I could get the GET variant to work easily--I hope you could follow that example). The way you put a CSRF token in that form definitely makes it non-trivial, though.<p>(BTW for anyone else to attempt a shot at this: the CSRF token is not actually the same value every time, but random generated and fixed with the session cookie, so clear your cookies before you try your brilliant exploit)",1321045331

While they are no more powerful than what you can find or make in Java, they are extremely convenient to use.  Note that Norvig solves both problems exclusively using these structures.<p>Norvig's sudoku solver <i>is</i> using depth-first search and backtracking, implemented in the function ""search"".  I'm not sure where you are getting the idea that it is simultaneously using many more boards than the search depth.<p>Google could well be using every clever trick you can think of to implement their spelling corrector, but I think you're overestimating the value of tracking user variations over multiple searches.  It's highly unlikely that someone searched for ""Pauel Garahum"" in the past, then corrected it to ""Paul Graham"".  Likewise, you can search for ""brootnenny spars"" and it comes up with a good suggestion.  More likely, they are using the search frequency as an indicator of correctness (P(c) in Norvig's article) and coming up with a better error model (P(w|c)), probably using phonetics as you proposed earlier.  And once you have this, you don't really need to go through the effort of correlating search variations.<p>It is, however, well-known that Google tracks the links that people click on and uses this information to improve search rankings.  They may well be tracking whether or not the user clicks on results and using this fact to improve their estimate of the correctness of the search.<p>...And I'm not sure if you know this, but the reason Norvig specifically mentions <i>Google's</i> spelling correction is because he is Google's Director of Research.  He didn't ""not realize"" that Google could be using search results to improve spelling correction; he intentionally left stuff out because the article is only supposed to be an introduction to spelling correction.",1223647178

Even a FogBugz or BaseCamp type of application on SQLite could be problematic if you are doing lots of writes.<p>The driver you use to connect to the database is also very important. If I'm not mistaken the PHP driver was pretty terrible a while back. It may be better now. It didn't handle the locks well which sometimes resulted in deadlocked queries with only a handful of users.<p>Personally, I wouldn't run any multiuser application doing a significant number of writes on SQLite except during early development. I think where it really shines is when you need a lightweight embedded SQL database without the hassle of having to install something extra. Think Amarok or something similar.<p>I ran Trac on SQLite for a while. Setup was a breeze and performance was reasonable with 3 or 4 users, but a switch to PostgreSQL was a night and day improvement.<p>If you're set on using an embedded database you might want to check out Firebird or H2. I haven't used Firebird myself, but I have had excellent results with H2. You have the flexibility to use it a few different ways - embedded vs. server mode and in-memory vs. disk storage - and it is very compatible with MySQL syntax so it's useful as a drop-in replacement.",1223647130

328811,comment,328279,328599,0,0,tstegart,,,"I don't think that's a bad way of going about it, just that it might not always be applicable. Some people go into business because they like business and see an opportunity, even though they may never use the product themselves. So they can't design it for themselves, because they wouldn't use it, and wouldn't know how it is used, or the best way to use it (such as a medical device company or something along those lines). So someone who has a great idea but is not a likely customer will have a lot to gain by going out and asking what real customers want and expect and what they would pay.",1223646867

So, why are they presenting the doom deck now?<p>The VCs I have met were talking about a serious downturn over 16 months ago and I've known for at least 4 years that the real estate bubble was going to cause a lot of problems. I think lots of people saw this coming. So, why did we have to get to this point before getting such sober advice? Seems odd to me.",1223646635

Once my partner and I decided on a design we liked, we checked out the designer's profile and saw all the contests he won in the past, all his submissions, etc.  They were all quality - the real deal and not just another guy with a pirated copy of Photoshop.  We then contacted him with some minor requests and he made the changes within hours of our email.  This process continued for the duration of the contest and it was nothing but a good and easy experience.  End result - we got a great logo we love.<p>Feedback is key to this process!  And definitely check out the designer's profile and his other submissions.  It's a good way to see their style and if it matches your tastes.  Also a good way to see if they just submit a generic logo and just modify the text for each contest they enter.",1223646290

521842,comment,521530,521530,0,0,tptacek,,,"I've never liked this paper.<p>First, I quibble that the metrics are off: the ""code ratio"" ignores intrinsic factors that alter the numbers, such as the overhead in a ""scripting"" language for driving the interpreter and managing its resources.<p>Second, and more importantly, it posits that the role of a scripting language is to automate and glue together systems code. History hasn't borne that argument out. You can assert that every Python or Ruby extension is an example of systems code offered by the interpreter for glueing, but architecturally I can make the same claim about every kernel interface, device driver, and chipset feature. The fact is that in 2009 high-level languages are the principal programming environment; lots of apps get built without even considering a ""systems programming"" environment.<p>Finally, what makes Osterhout's argument even more incoherent is the fact that there's no real line of division between systems programming languages and scripting languages. Feature for feature, Common Lisp and Python are both ""scripting"" languages in Osterhout's definition. But Common Lisp is a fine systems programming language (people build operating systems in it). He really just seems to be building walls around the immaturity of specific interpreters --- Tcl, in particular, which has always had one of the most primitive execution environments.<p>There's no such thing as a ""scripting language"". They're all just programming languages.",1237391892

Back in college I remember reading a book about effects of various computer aids on our cognitive development [the users in question were mostly teenagers/students]. Programmers were mentioned too. Relying on compilers to catch syntax errors or auto-completing IDEs to suggest method names we're basically refusing to pay attention/memorize things, which ultimately leads to a much poorer skill quality. Ever since then I've been training myself to expect my code to compile at 1st try, i.e. I would do a quick reviews before hitting the ""build"" hotkey.<p>From my experience: I think most Microsoft developers will feel completely lost if left with a command line compiler and  notepad.exe Even if you take coding out of the equation, many don't have a good understanding of what makes an executable, i.e. they wont' be able to build a project without an IDE.",1237391306

Before the iPhone, AT&T was adding customers at a rate comparable to Verizon.  AT&T's churn rate (the rate that customers leave) is the second best in the industry (marginally higher than Verizon).  What are you going off of?  Vocal detractors?  Heck, even going back to the 4Q 2006 (before the iPhone was even introduced), AT&T was having greater net additions than Verizon.<p>That doesn't mean they're ""better"".  Just that they are perceived as the company that customers want to sign up with and stay with more than any other company (combining the two metrics there).<p><i>Arguably [widgets were] a good thing</i><p>I totally agree that widgets are better for certain apps than applications.  However, the iPhone can do both.  And it's true that there is a buildup time.  However, that makes the Pre's case worse.  If the argument is that it took Apple 6 months to really get apps, then the Pre is even further behind given that their delay will probably be even longer since they're a smaller platform to develop for.<p><i>Pricing a plan at cheaper than the entry level iPhone plan would definitely leave more people wondering if getting the iPhone is worth it</i><p>This is what Sprint needs - at least initially.  They won't draw people from what is seen as a superior device on a superior network by charging the same.  If they sell the Pre at $200 and service at comparable pricing, they won't sell many of them.  However, to undersell the iPhone would be hard for management to stomach.  The Pre is unlikely to cost less to manufacture - in fact, scale would probably make the iPhone a good deal cheaper.  If the Pre can get up to the status of the iPhone, then they could sell it at parity, but it has a long way to go that includes proving its reliability, getting applications, etc.<p>I like Apple, but I'm starting to dislike them more as they become more powerful.  I wouldn't trade my MacBook Pro for a PC and the iPhone is just so nice, but I'm getting tired of how they try to tie everything together to rake in more money.  I'll be really glad if the Pre evens the playing field a bit and provides Apple with competition they never saw in the MP3 player arena.",1237389806

First, when devs were faced with the prospect that for the next <i>year</i> Apple would not be providing a real way to write native applications for the iPhone, plenty of webapps popped up. Arguably this was a good thing, because some of the apps were better done as webapps rather than as native apps. Unfortunately a distinction many published app store developers seem to love ignoring now..but there's no shortage of iPhone-specific mobile sites out there. Also don't forget that there were effectively zero third party applications <i>and</i> webapps for the iPhone before January 2007. :P<p>Then there is the idea that before AT&T and the iPhone, AT&T wasn't liked, they're still not liked (especially when their network can't handle the influx of network traffic at iPhone-heavy events and locations), and the biggest reason why the carriers were freaked out was because of the popularity of the iPhone on ONLY one carrier. Perhaps Sprint could figure out a way to benefit from having a phone that could theoretically compete with the iPhone.

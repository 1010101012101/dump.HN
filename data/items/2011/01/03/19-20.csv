Every solution will boil down to a loop, necessarily, so my point is it's useless to make distinctions like , ""this solution is a bit cheating, but this one isn't"". As long as it respects the requirements, eg no loop or conditional <i>statements</i>, it is no cheating.<p>> Nothing personal, but your argument is always used in these situations<p>I realize my original comment was oversimplifying things, but i fail to see which situations you are talking about. My argument, or what i originally wanted it to be, is that the  line you draw between map and the constructor trick is <i>extremely</i> subjective. In such case, the only way to distinguish valid or invalid solutions is to refer to the original requirements.<p>> Please learn where to draw the line.<p>And please keep your condescending attitude to yourself. I perfectly know where to draw the line, and i still consider the limit tptacek made to be ridiculous. If you have any real argument to oppose me instead of sheer oversimplification and exaggeration, please proceed, but from what i see you just needed to vent, and in a rather unpleasant manner.",1294084793

2064442,comment,2063203,2064365,2,0,telemachos,,,"> Python is well-integrated in Ubuntu and Debian<p>I've heard this before, but I almost wonder if it's the exception that proves the rule. That is, the rule is: your OS is not likely to provide up-to-date development library packages (or interpreters for that matter) for your scripting language of choice. As a developer, you will need to get and build stuff by hand, you will need to manage a complex set of changing load paths, you will need lots of coffee and help. You will come to rely on and love tools <i>outside</i> of the normal distribution tool-chain.<p>I don't do Python, but this rule has proven to be true for me for Perl and Ruby, on systems including OSX, OpenBSD and Debian. I <i>always</i> end up having to get cpanm to install Perl modules, Perlbrew to install newer (or variant) Perl interpreters and ditto for Ruby, rvm and company. (I dabble in Haskell and Lua, and it's true there too so far as I can tell. But my experiences with those languages are too limited to really say.)<p>I think that Python is a special case, and I honestly don't know why. Maybe they've figured out something that Perl and Ruby haven't. Maybe it's because Gnome is built using Python very heavily, and Debian ships with a default Gnome desktop and so they care more about Python. Maybe the Python team at Debian is just better staffed. I don't know, but Python is the exception here.",1294084547

I've got my server, it's all set up, I type 'cap deploy' and it takes care of everything, including my dependancies. I don't need to 'figure out what works,' because my application is developed locally, I already have all of the versions worked out, because it's what I was building the software with. This situation is a happy one. Everything's good. Yes, I'm technically using two package managers, but I don't really care: it's all been abstracted away, and everything _actually works_.<p>If I try to do things through apt, all of the gems simply aren't there. Or older versions of things, which break because my code was written with newer ones. It's simply a non-starter.<p>However, from a sysadmin standpoint, where you're keeping Ruby on a system for a certain reason, the use case is totally different.<p>The real problem happens when people who use Ubuntu because they're new to Linux want to start with Rails, and it has to be explained that almost nothing they read will actually work properly.

2064420,comment,2064182,2064182,0,0,partition,,,"I pretty much agree with this.<p>In fact, when execution can be cast as implementing a computer program, one can be very formal about comparing ideas and execution; they are related the same way theorems and proofs are.<p>If we use the Curry-Howard isomorphism; the idea is often a type (""Let's make a program that turns X into Y!"") (a theorem) and the execution is often a program (a term realizing that type) (the proof).<p>So it seems that the value of an idea with no execution (which is not a theorem until it has been proved!) would be abstractly the same value as an unproved proposition. Except now, the proof not only says that the proposition is true, but also realizes whatever that proposition denotes, because it's a computer program. In that sense, execution of an idea is worth a lot more than the idea, because it also provides evidence that the idea is not nonsense.<p>But who to give more credit to? The idea guy or the implementor? Consider that when we change even a little bit of our execution, we are changing the idea , because it will prove something different. In this sense, both the idea and execution are very much in the hands of the 'implementor,' and the 'idea guy' only provides initial inspiration, which by its commonality is pretty much worthless.<p>Well, or maybe not; there is value in picking the right initial inspiration and perspective. Is that something only really experienced 'veterans', 'masters', 'talented people', and 'gurus' can have, or can it be explicitly trained and taught, so that this nebulous notion of 'having the right perspective' can be as simple and clear-cut as using a cookbook? I think the latter.<p>What about when execution consists of other, non-programming factors like talking with the right people, or marketing or whatnot? It's certainly harder to formalize, but I wonder what value there is in treating the non-obviously-programming parts of what is viewed as 'execution' as just another kind of programming, but not done with the usual compilers/interpreters.",1294084226

Here's the description from Wikipedia:<p><pre><code>    The Berners Street Hoax was perpetrated by Theodore Hook in the City\n    of Westminster, London, in 1809. Hook had made a bet with his friend,\n    Samuel Beazley, that he could transform any house in London into the\n    most talked-about address in a week, which he achieved by sending out\n    thousands of letters in the name of Mrs Tottenham, who lived at 54\n    Berners Street, requesting deliveries, visitors, and assistance.\n\n    On 27 November, at five o’clock in the morning, a sweep arrived to\n    sweep the chimneys of Mrs Tottenham's house. The maid who answered\n    the door informed him that no sweep had been requested, and that\n    his services were not required. A few moments later another sweep\n    presented himself, then another, and another, 12 in all. After the\n    last of the sweeps had been sent away, a fleet of carts carrying\n    large deliveries of coal began to arrive, followed by a series of\n    cakemakers delivering large wedding cakes, then doctors, lawyers,\n    vicars and priests summoned to minister to someone in the house\n    they had been told was dying.

By restricting one person's access to something it ensures access for someone else. IP is fundamentally different: it imposes a restriction where there is none, essentially, needed. Everyone can make copies of something without anyone else losing access to it.<p>Why impose a restriction on a useful abundance? Is there some deep virtue in denying ourselves some benefit?<p>> The fact that it's physically easy to steal intellectual property does not make it right.<p>But this is really the crux. It is exactly this difference that makes all the difference. If I could steal your normal, material, property, but leave it all in your possession, what is there to complain about? In fact, you could copy my property, then we would both have <i>two</i> lots of stuff -- this is not bad, this is good!<p>And people are saying there is a 'natural right' here -- a 'natural right' to stop us from benefiting, costlessly, from each other? It is crazy.<p>You could say that, pragmatically, the best way to fund production is by copyright-like restrictions. That is a reasonable proposition at least. But it is no longer anything to do with 'natural rights': it is not based on any fundamental necessity or desire, it is purely contingent and economic, proven by practicality and evidence.",1294082245

Printing USD is a tax on all current holders of USD - that is, it dilutes the value of all existing USD while raising money for the US government. Since there are large foreign holders of USD, but the US government can (theoretically) spend all of its USD on US citizens, printing money does in fact make us richer. This method of raising money is called seignorage, and it is how the US can tax the rest of the world to pay for whatever we want. We used it extensively during the Vietnam war to, in effect, make the French (large holders of USD at the time) pay for our war effort. They were not happy.<p>This says nothing of the long term effects of seniorage, just that printing money does, currently, make us richer.",1294081608

You usually have to share the compartment with up to 5 other travellers, but a handful of people in a small room tend to be much quieter (and more friendly) than dozens in an open plan carriage. Sadly, compartments are increasingly rare nowadays, even in first class.

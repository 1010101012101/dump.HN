However it does explain why every time I've wanted to try out someone's Android device they had to enable data for me.<p>No wonder.

No one would do that, but they do pirate content because it's unbelievably easy and there are no consequences.

4858922,comment,4858715,4858801,7,0,yason,,,"This, exactly this.<p>Moreover, I think that piracy mostly happens because either it's the only way or because it's way too cheap.<p>The first case is similar to how I was as a kid: I pirated all my games and software and copied all my music, and then bought the best games and the best albums <i>that I could afford</i>. I owned the games and cds that I considered the best, and worth owning. I paid for them <i>so that I could own them</i>: not because I would've wanted to make sure the authors could make a living. No amount of piracy laws and copyright enforcement would've added anything to the funds I had at my disposal. I already spent whatever I had.<p>The second case is why some people hoard files. They download full discographies and filmographies of nearly everything there is because copying is so cheap it's practically gratis, copying can be fun, and just to make sure that if the world comes to an end they'll still have years of entertainment in their hands. They probably watch and listen one percent of what they're downloaded, and they probably actually buy one percent of that one percent.<p>There's a third case of ""piracy"" which is just casual copying, to sample the products. People first download music and torrent movies and sample what they've got. If they find a good director or a good band, they buy a collection or a set of albums. I don't really consider these people a problem since they're consumers at heart and they use downloading mostly to find stuff to buy. If they couldn't download, they wouldn't find much music or games or movies, and they would subsequently buy less.",1354394900

Many freelancers are juggling several projects, but still looking for few more to keep busy during the week. Some are looking for a future gig so that they have something to move on to next.<p>Two, the ""developer shortage"" you speak of tends to refer to full-time on-site developers. The people that fit these roles are not always the same as the people who are freelancers, often for lifestyle reasons. For example, not everyone wants to move to Palo Alto and work 60 hour weeks. Instead some choose the freelancing path because they have discovered that they can live more fulfilling lives by entirely avoiding the bureaucratic fascism of modern employment.<p>And finally, it's possible that the aforementioned ""shortage"" is the cause of a surplus in the other direction. It's easy to have ideas, and hard to implement them, so there are a lot of empty-shell startups springing up.

Developers and other content creators have got a better grip on regional pricing, most markets see software being released particularly since online distribution, and the software market has seen more budget alternatives to big name brands become available.<p>This response may appear rather dishevelled, but that is because I'm not sure what the point is that the article is attempting to touch on.

It's still a tremendously more complex language than BASIC.<p>I help teach an after-school programming class for middle schoolers. Last year, we tried using Python. While some students got the hang of it, many seemed confused and demotivated.<p>This year, I wrote a simple TinyBASIC REPL from scratch[1], aiming to produce the simplest subset of the language that made it possible to do interesting things and illustrate concepts like looping, branching, variables, etc. It was a big hit with the kids, and the whole class has been extremely engaged. As a next step, I've built a Logo[2] implementation so that we can move into writing modular, reusable procedures and play with graphics.<p>Learning to program is almost entirely orthogonal to learning a language, and I think that starting with very small ""toy"" languages is a good way to approach teaching core concepts without getting lost in the quirks and complex features of popular ""real"" languages. BASIC is small, Python will never be.<p><pre><code>  [1]https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Mako/tree/master/demos/Masica\n  [2]https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Mako/tree/master/demos/Loko</code></pre>",1354393330

Should we be okay with piracy as long as the pirate is using it for self-betterment? Do games count for that? What about pirating Game of Thrones episodes? (Or, to take a wild leap: Is it cool for a kid to steal a car if he learns how to be a mechanic from it?)<p>Today, I do feel there are some motions towards providing better access to software and hardware in poorer parts of the world. Which is great. And, to be frank, the quality of both cheap hardware and open source software is <i>insane</i> relative to twenty years ago. So, again, I'm not sure what Vlad's bigger point is.<p>If the point is to justify piracy, I think he only does it in the very narrowest of ways: Considering the state of technology in the 1990s, piracy enabled people in poorer parts of the world (and kids in wealthier parts of the world) access to the growing information technology industry. I'm not sure that argument exactly holds in the same way today.<p>Finally, Microsoft can survive a fair amount of piracy. But not every software company can. What happens when this ""it's cool because I'm using it to educate myself"" stance kills software companies? Or game companies? Or media companies? Is that better for everyone?<p>---<p>EDIT: I'm not equating the act of stealing a car with the act of pirating Windows. I am merely wondering about the general nature of morally justifying a crime based on it being done for self-improvement.

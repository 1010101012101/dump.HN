Once you&#x27;re hooked, and you begin gaining experience, you will naturally understand the limitations of the platform. By being inquisitive, you will realise that the software used in the real world isn&#x27;t all built in Scratch. But, to breed that inquisitiveness in children at a young age requires making it accessible.<p>You, for example, probably very quickly realised that if you wanted to make games with a GUI, QBASIC was not the tool for you, but by the sounds of it, that didn&#x27;t dissuade you.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m of the opinion that your very first language doesn&#x27;t matter very much. As a programmer, you will (should) be learning plenty more, so the first one is more about learning how to learn than anything else.",1433231972

It was kind of ridiculous in that the layoffs were on a Monday and my Green Card interview as on the following Friday. The amount of stress I went through was intense. Despite now knowing that I would probably have gotten atleast 2 weeks of a paid holiday which would have ensured that the green card would have gone through.<p>And I can see some unethical managers exploiting that situation.

My current company has quite a few Indians (born and bred) who work normal 9-5 hours while being on an H1B.<p>Ironically enough I work more insane hours these days. Not cause I particularly am in fear of my job. Because I have finally found that niche that I am good at. And I am in a hurry to achieve some life goals.<p>I am of Indian origin, born and grew up in Africa. I have gone to India and witnessed first hand all the bullshit rigmarole that goes around in enforcing a cult-like structure. I also refused to accept that as my choice in life and left. I do understand how that choice might be harder for someone whose ties are much stronger.<p>I guess where I am conflicted is this implied message in your comment that it is totally about the societal structure and the corporate enslavement.

They differ greatly in terms of grammar, pronunciation and vocabulary. Note that vernacular isn&#x27;t mere slang: it&#x27;s one&#x27;s native language.<p>Also, the vernaculars form a sort of dialect continuum: a Iraqi might have little problem understanding a Syrian from a nearby area, and Syrians might have little trouble understanding Palestinians, and so on, but Iraqi and Moroccan  Arabic have little mutual intelligibility.<p>Neither phenomenon is unique to Arabic. Some Americans speak, say, African American Vernacular English but can also use &quot;standard&quot; American English; of course the difference isn&#x27;t that big in this case. Brazilian Portuguese is another case of diglossia: the written language has multiple verb tenses and conjugations that aren&#x27;t used in spoken language, for example.<p>Dialect continuums also happen in other places, e.g. the Getman speaking countries.<p>But Arabic is an especially extreme and interesting case (subjectively speaking).",1433230105

To have skin in the game, you should share both in the upside and downside. Taleb quotes the 3,800 year old Hammurabi’s code: “If a builder builds a house and the house collapses and causes the death of the owner – the builder shall be put to death”. It is interesting to view this from a software development perspective. I have never worked on software where people’s lives were in danger if the software failed, but I would not be willing to submit to Hammurabi’s code if I did. But I think a little less extreme form of skin in the game is actually very good. Being on call for example. If the software you wrote fails, you may get called in the middle of the night to help fix it. I have been on call at most of the places I have worked in the past, and I think it has a lot of benefits. It gives you an incentive to be very thorough, both in development and testing. It also forces you to make the software debuggable – otherwise you yourself will suffer. Another way of introducing skin in the game is dog-fooding – using the software you are developing in your daily work. I have never worked on software that we have been able to dog-food, but I think that is another great practice.<p><a href=""http://henrikwarne.com/2014/06/08/antifragility-and-software-development/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://henrikwarne.com/2014/06/08/antifragility-and-software...</a>",1433230019

I&#x27;ve significantly cut down expenses. Resulting in me being fairly well off.<p>Being fairly passive about may work, or may not work. I know plenty of brilliant people who love their work but get paid terribly for it.<p>My strategy is actually fairly reproducible, instead of relying on luck.<p>I&#x27;ve also found that all else being equal(same industry etc) salary is the number 1 indicator of respect on the job.",1433228512

These often work well for services that either have massive economies of scale (Amazon), or strong network effects (Facebook).<p>But another business model is to grow slowly, focusing on profitability along the way, and this works well for businesses in a niche (Pingdom), with low network effects (Basecamp) or high marginal cost per user (Digital Ocean). If a business with high marginal costs per user and low network effects goes after explosive growth by subsidising users, they run the risk of running out of cash before the point they have enough profit to cover the subsidy.<p>There are lots of exceptions - Spotify and Dropbox come to mind. But there are lots more forgotten startups that incorrectly thought &quot;If we get eyeballs and engagement, the revenue will follow&quot;.",1433228505

Live in best parts of those towns and hang out with people who are educated and pro western and quite exposed to other cultures.</i><p>That. Same with media cherry-picking some favorable tweeters from a country (usually upper middle class younger people aligning with its biases) and promoting them as &quot;the voice of their people&quot; or some bogus &quot;new generation&quot; that&#x27;s about to bring change.<p>It&#x27;s even worse in places with strategic interest, where e.g the government puts obstacles to foreign corporations to grab resources on the cheap or prevents foreign diplomatic influence in the region, in which case there are lots of media, &quot;NGO&quot;s and such sponsored by foreign powers (a modern-day &quot;radio free europe&quot; affair), and the foreign media gets their &quot;facts&quot; and opinions from them and pretend they reflect the country at question, its interests and what the majority of the population believes. A lot of times some opposition party is sponsored too, and played big, even if it&#x27;s supported only by a small minority.",1433228477

2148520,comment,2147642,2148240,0,0,hyperbovine,,,"This. My 3 year-old MacBook is starting to show its age, so I took a look at what's out there. I was intrigued by the HP Envy 14--at long last, it seems somebody besides Apple figured out how to build a nice laptop. And you seem get a lot more for your money.<p>Of course, going back to Windows after 3+ years on OSX is no option, so I looked into Ubuntu. I use Ubuntu on a machine at work and have been very impressed--we've certainly come a long ways since the dark days of Slackware `96! I am enough of a ""power user"" that I could weather the switch just fine; really the only thing I would miss is iTunes since I have two iPods.<p>Anyways, I started Googling around on the topic of ""hp envy 14 +ubuntu"". And that's when I was instantly transported back fifteen years to the days, weeks, months I spent tinkering with past laptops in order to get everything working on them under Linux. I had all but forgotten about 30-page hardware HOWTOs on getting Linux to work with your specific laptop; the 20% battery penalty you pay because pm never quite works; the inability of some things, usually network and sound cards, to wake from sleep; the lack of hibernate; buggy graphics drivers; etc. etc. etc.<p>I am aware that the situation has improved considerably since then, but problems still remain. I just don't have the time like I did in my teens and early 20s. Or rather, my time is worth considerably more now--I'm happy to pay the Apple tax if it means I don't have to deal with this shit.<p>That said, if some major HW manufacturer ever came out with a completely supported laptop with Ubuntu preloaded, working power management, graphics drivers that do what they are supposed to, etc., I would totally bite. (I am aware the some, e.g. Dell, have done so, but when I see warnings like <a href=""http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3518/p/19242907/19373496.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3518/p/...</a> it's evident that they half-assed it.

2148448,comment,2147791,2147791,0,0,filiwickers,,,"After tearing my achilles two years ago I became determined to fix my body's structural imbalances. I cannot say enough about how powerful the Stronglifts program is (and other similar programs). As a part of my training (along with a lot of pilates and yoga) I have done the StrongLifts program. I had done some weight training previously, was comfortable with each one of the lifts, and could find my way around the weight room. I think StrongLifts was the perfect lifting program for my situation, and will be to anyone else in a similar place. Im going to comment a bit more about the actual program, what you need to know about it, and why I recommend it.<p>Stronglifts uses two alternating workouts A, B. The program focuses on eight different lifts (see site for full details). Workout A is Squats, Bench, Inverted Rows, Push Ups; Workout B is Squats, Overhead Press, Deadlifts, PullUps/ChinUps. The goal of the program is to build as much pure strength as possible. And it works. Doing compound lifts like this allows you to use as much muscle as possible while lifting the maximum amount of weight. The downside is that these lifts are not the easiest to learn. The key is to START LIGHT. Keep the weight light- lighter than you think- until you are consistently lifting with good form.<p>If you are going to the gym with the goal of living a healthier life then you are wasting your time if you are not squatting. Please - learn how to squat, learn how to do it correctly, and get your butt as close to the ground as your flexibility allows. A full-depth squat is healthier for knees, develops additional muscles (mostly your butt), and is very impressive when you are putting up 2xx  pounds on your squat and your butt is almost touching the ground.<p>Learning correct form for any lift is essential. Please learn the right form when the weights are light. Once the weight gets higher your chances of injury from incorrect form skyrocket. Learning a lift incorrectly also makes it harder to learn correctly. So do it right the first time.<p>Now for my actual Stronglifts review. I love it. I am addicted to it. I never in my life imagined I would be lifting as much as I am. I would not have gotten here without sticking to Stronglifts. I like Stronglifts because you know exactly how much you have to lift each day. There is an equation for everything. If you have a shitty day and cant lift something you just go back the next time and try again. There is no way to cheat but at the same time you are always progressing. If your squat is struggling your bench might be feeling great. I always had progress to motivate me to go back.<p>That is the real key to any workout program, consistency. It does not matter what program you do- Stronglifts, starting strength, 3x5, 10x54, lean body now, grandma chair exercises, etc- just pick something and stick to it. Go to the gym when you feel great or when you feel like shit. I love doing squats. Doing squats 5x5 three times a week sucks no matter how you look at it. What keeps me going back is the sense of accomplishment you feel after lifting weights you never though possible. That and the huge/strong muscles part...<p>1) The health benefits of weight lifting using compound movements are not to be taken lightly- you may be shocked at what your body becomes after a year of committed work in the gym.<p>2) You are wasting your time going to the gym to lift weights if you are: not sticking to a program & documenting your workout (yes- gym notebook required), not doing full depth squats, not doing compound lifts.",1296146349

This was March 2009. I didn't have any real savings, and my parents couldn't bail me out. I qualified for the maximum which was about $316 per week after taxes.<p>So of course immediately I was looking for a job, and had an offer in hand by the end of April, but it was for a lower paying job, it was clearly a stop-gap job. I think many people my age, don't want stop-gaps, but when you don't have a support system you need to do what needs to be done. Of course I kept moving forward and looking to move up, made a move from DC to NY for better money, and continue advancing. But had I not taken the ""stop-gap"" I would've crashed and burned.<p>And so, the other folks I know who didn't take similar paths had one thing in common: they could count on their families or some financial support system.

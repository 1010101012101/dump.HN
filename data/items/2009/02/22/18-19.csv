For all the teasing that cuil received, the did try something pretty interesting with the ui, for instance.<p>I also know that competing on search is very difficult and expensive, given the computational demands, which is why new, good quality competitors is hard for us to come by.",1235329095

You're fixated on doing everything in the same directory, when in fact it's far easier <i>not</i> to do it that way, and the only argument you're making for doing it that way, is that it's more ""flexible"".  But flexibility is not a virtue, unless you <i>need</i> the flexibility!<p><i>""obviously you'd never actually do all this in SVN if you were sensible""</i><p>Exactly.  You'd never do it.  You don't <i>need</i> to do it.  You can <i>get the job done</i> without doing it.  And that's what matters.<p>Git fanboys are hilarious sometimes...every argument is made from the position that none of the rest of us really understand git, and that if only we did, we'd fall in love with git in all of it's fiddly glory.  What they miss is that many of us <i>hate</i> complexity, and we avoid complexity that doesn't justify itself with true functional advantages.<p>I like simple tools that get the job done.  Git makes my life harder;  I have to think about <i>more</i> things to do the same, basic tasks that were made trivially easy in subversion.  That's the point.",1235327909

490729,comment,490572,490577,0,0,patio11,,,"I have heard this piece of advice several dozen times on another board and I wonder if anyone has tried it in the last 3 years or so.  It seems destined for failure to me:<p>1)  A new AdWords account starts with no history.  To get preferable placement you'll have to be significantly outbidding the people who already have history.  (i.e. I pay Google four cents a click for front page placement for, I don't know, [how to make a bingo card].  If you started a new AdWords account today Google would charge you a quarter.<p>2)  There are automated quality checks which score sites these days and can raise your minimum bid to stupidly high levels, which is essentially Google's way of declining your business.  If you put up a page for a product which doesn't exist, you are highly likely to have these checks fire on you, since they're specifically designed to bounce squeeze pages.<p>3)  Getting a click on an AdWords ad doesn't prove the customer had interest, it proves that you wrote the ad well.  Conversely, not getting the click doesn't prove there was no interest, it merely proves the ad was not interesting.  Do you have someone in your organization skilled at the art of writing 3 line advertising copy?  If not, what are you burning money for?",1235326536

He says you can delay profi^H^H^H^H^H revenue almost indefinitely by looking out on the horizon.<p>So given these two facts, when exactly do the founders/managers/employees (all of which are young kids by his own admission) start getting paid real money, like the amount required to buy a house in the Santa Clara valley?<p>Is payoff 100% contingent on a liquidity event and/or perpetual venture capitalization, thereby diluting founders' capital stock further and further?  Are his venture founders supposed to continue living in apartments indefinitely while he looks on from his mansion in Atherton and architects the final vision to be realized a decade or more from assignment of preferred stock?<p>His whole management vision starts to look more and more like serfdom the longer you think about it.  The immediate analog that springs to mind is the A&R practices of the music industry in which they sign young, naive bands to contracts that essentially bind them into a period of servitude under the guise of a promise of fame and fortune (to be realized in spades at a later date TBD, just trust us guys, you're gonna be rich and famous!!!) while paying for their operating costs with a future claim on earnings.<p>This comparison only gets stronger than it already is when you realize that most financially successful musicians make their money from touring and merchandising - realizing their own revenue in small, and sometimes incremental ways until they get a successful fan/customer base.<p>I mean the whole analogy seems rather obvious to me, and I believe we as (young entrepreneurs of) an industry should learn the lessons of the music/entertainment industry - am I totally wrong here?<p>I see no difference between Marc Andreesen and David Geffen.

But I think it's better for kids to separate the school from the sports.  Put the kid into a independent sports league.  And it's better, I think, to be playing in an environment where the competition for positions isn't as intense - i.e. a smaller school or sports club.<p>In a related matter I see that Sidwell Friends does play football.

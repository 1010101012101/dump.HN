I always did well in school, understanding the key issues in a design problem (aerospace engineering) long before my classmates, and I always attributed it to my sleep habits (8-10 hrs daily).<p>On the other hand, some of my finest moments of clarity have come after all-night cramming sessions. It's as if you fatigue all the usual pathways and are open up to entirely new ways of seeing things.",1222566187

317334,comment,317160,317160,0,0,vlad,,,"Bodybuilders and weightlifters know that muscle grows in one's sleep.  I think the key to working on anything into the night is following up with lots of sleep.  That way, one gets the benefit of both sleep and sleep deprivation.<p>Every once in a while in the past, when I was working on my own project, I've done it to the point where I would sleep from 2am to 1pm, and the next time living in the dark for a day due to going to bed around sunrise (5am) and waking up at sundown (6pm), and so on. Eventually, I would have a normal schedule again. :)  This was when my only focus was on writing code for my software and working out, period.  Since my software became better every week, and I grew stronger, bigger, and faster as well, my goals were pretty much met and I was happy.<p>I like my current life as a student, due to the social aspect of learning from, and working with, others.  But I am nowhere near as productive at developing my own software on a daily basis nor working out as I was when those were my only two goals.  However, I understand that it has only been a few weeks, and I will be able to figure out how to introduce software and personal development into my schedule as I get more used to the demands of my classes.  And even though I won't be able to dedicate as much time as I could before, I have the experience and confidence to get in shape and create software more efficiently, as well as the benefit of a being around lots of potential users.",1222566131

Its nice to see a company taking official support in regards to the things that affect their employees in non-work situations.<p>And for those saying companies don't take sides or make announcements, lets name a couple. Chick-fil-a is closed on Sundays. Why, because the founder is a hard-right Christian who thinks everyone should go to church or they go to hell. I worked there when I was a teenager, firsthand experience.<p>How about Dominos? The founder built a town outside of Naples in Florida strictly for Christians.

317329,comment,317213,317213,0,0,jimrandomh,,,"This assumes that compiler optimizations proceed exponentially, but it's actually asymptotic. There is a hypothetical ideal form, where no further optimization is possible. Each optimization brings the program closer to that form, and as you get close, you start running into diminishing returns.<p>Besides, most of the interesting problems are questions of how many programs you can optimize, not much you can optimize one given program. Automatic parallelization and vectorization is worth an order of magnitude speed improvement, but compilers can only apply it in a small percentage of the cases where it would be applicable.",1222565441

If Google  believe that in the future people will look back on this issue in the same way, then this could also be a savvy business position. Also, in the eyes of Sergey, this is probably just another way for Google to not be evil.",1222565095

If someone has something to add, they will.  This is already possible.  Everyone can comment on any comment.<p>You are asking to formalize something that already exists, and to do so in a stupidly paternalistic manner.  Personally, I don't come to HN to provide feedback on every dumbass post that I think is dumb.  (Though I very, very, rarely downvote.  I'm far more likely to call something stupid in a comment and explain why...but I don't think anyone should be forced to explain why they think something is stupid.  A downvote is a much more concise and efficient way to say it.  I just happen to be a blowhard that enjoys the sound of my own voice, and so I comment a lot more than I vote.)<p>And, I agree with the above: Meta-discussion about karma and voting is just annoying.  Stop doing it.  It's irritating, and this kind of suggestion comes up every couple of weeks or so and gets shouted down because most of us disagree pretty strongly with it...just as this one has been.",1222564760

317312,comment,317213,317213,0,0,gizmo,,,"I realized this myself when I wrote my first JIT compiler. The x86 code generated from bytecode was frightingingly naive. With basic code inlining and redundant instruction elimination my scripting language ran at 95% the speed of the equivalent c program with -O3 optimizations. And the assembly code generated by gcc was at least 3 times shorter.<p>Processors do a damn good job at optimizing code, and cache locality is more important than you'd think. The CPU blazes through redundant mov instructions like there's no tomorrow.<p>The good news is that building a fully functioning native code compiler is doable by a single person.",1222564540

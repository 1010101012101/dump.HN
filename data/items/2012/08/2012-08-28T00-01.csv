There's only 2/3 resolutions to support anyway (plus two orientations for each). Android is of course more varied.<p>For desktop apps, you're getting increasingly specialized software (the rest going to Web apps) and your best bet is still to stick to the native libraries (Cocoa, WPF, etc).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://weblogs.java.net/blog/enicholas/archive/2006/03/style_swing_com.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weblogs.java.net/blog/enicholas/archive/2006/03/style...</a>",1346115590

Now, before you fellow hosers scream ""Sacrilege"", hear me out.<p>Beyond all of the licensing issues and stupid protectionism rules and laws we have here in Canada, services wishing to be in this country are doing so in probably the most similar country to the US than anywhere in the world. The dollar is almost at par, our language is the same (for most of us), culturally we're incredibly similar, we like the same kinds of entertainment and laugh at most of the same kinds of jokes. We  share the worlds longest unprotected border, with billions and billions of goods travelling across in an entirely over-tariffed manner. We have very few barriers to entry into each other's country, causing a hell of a lot of cross-border whatever-you-wanted-to-do. Heck, we even have border cities named the same (Niagara Falls anyone?).<p>If fact, as a Canadian, if I were to simply just land in any US city and tell everyone I'm a US citizen they'd probably have no reason to disagree with me (at least until I ended a sentence in ""Eh"" or talked goofy).<p>In Canada, we're called a branch-plant economy (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_plant_economy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_plant_economy</a>) and I'd hazard to say that many American operating companies could simply provide service with very little technical barriers.<p>I'm just amazed at how we're so accessible to each other in many ways and yet so many services are off limits and stuff like iPads are released here a month later.

It demonstrated that creating great projects/systems/code requires more than money, mindshare, and enthusiasm.  While those are all useful, also important is skill and experience.<p>Think of it this way, if five, not particularly experienced programmers, could dive in and just create a fully functional distributed-replacement for Facebook, then wouldn't that make a mockery of the skills/experience of developers that spent a lifetime acquiring them?<p>If anything, this enhances the kickstarter ecosystem, putting an emphasis on how important it is to evaluate the experience/skill of the principals behind a project.<p>For the counter-example, look at Dalton Caldwell's App.net.  Here is a guy with a heck-ton of experience, and, from what I've heard, a talented developer.<p>He had a mostly functional API/Alpha of the twitter-clone portion of app.net (and, long term, I think the twitter component may not be the most important element) before they had even reached their funding target.  And, the UI/App continues to land new features, week after week.  In less than a month, alpha.app.net is already more feature complete and functional compared to where it needs to be to replace Twitter, than Diaspora was after two years.<p>Talent and Experience are critical.   A great developer can accomplish in a few weeks, what less talented developers can't accomplish in a couple years.<p>That's my takeaway from Diaspora, and it's kind of a positive message.",1346114951

Our performance metric was well-reasoned; as you mention, we cared about the happiness of our customer, and baked all sorts of useful information into our evaluation metrics.<p>The problem is there is not always a cheap way to encode a complex evaluation metric into a loss function for many machine learning algorithms. In fact most of the really popular algorithms are popular because they work well mathematically - for example, generalized linear models are convex on a simple quadratic loss function, and neural networks have gradients when their loss functions are differentiable.<p>Also, I found optimizing for simple but sensible loss functions often gave pretty good performance. From a practical perspective, most of the gains of understanding the performance metrics we cared about came in the data preparation, evaluation and calibration stages of modeling, not model selection or training.",1346114816

It was heavily influenced by very few (I believe he mentions 1 or 2) <i>specific</i> scientists and became orthodoxy almost through force of will not necessarily because the data (which they didn't have) actually supported the hypothesis.<p>2:  There are now numerous studies and quite a bit of data that seem to at least point to alternative hypothesis <i>that should be explored</i>. I don't recall yet having seen the author claim even the carbohydrate hypothesis he talks about is correct, just that it should be getting more study/attention than it is in main-stream nutritional science, and that it is better supported by the study data we do have than the currently accepted hypothesis which the studies we undertaken to test.<p>3:  The idea that sedentary lifestyles coupled with abundantly available food just doesnt track with the actual data as obesity seems to track much more closely with availability highly refined carbohydrates and massively increased sugar consumption. That said <i>both</i> could well play into it, it isnt necessarily an either-or but much like the famous global warming vs. number of pirates graph it also doesnt show causation, just correlation, and perhaps meaningless/misleading correlation at that.<p>4:  Explaining obesity by overeating is as useful as explaining alcoholism by overdrinking (okay, I just threw that in because it is a funny quote :))<p>His primary push that I have taken away thus far is we should be exploring this hypothesis, which isnt actually terribly new nor is it terribly radical. He claims people generally arent for unclear reasons (though I haven't picked up any sort of conspiracy vibes yet, which I was expecting). I have looked around for someone to refute his book but all I found was a weak refutation in Reason[1] which he responded to, and in my opinion, destroyed the critique quite handily [2]. I would be very interested in any responses that actually take to task the quoted studies / science from his book instead of attacking him by-proxy by calling Atkins a kook.<p>[1] <a href=""http://reason.com/archives/2003/03/01/big-fat-fake/print"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reason.com/archives/2003/03/01/big-fat-fake/print</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://reason.com/archives/2003/03/01/an-exercise-in-vitriol-rather/print"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reason.com/archives/2003/03/01/an-exercise-in-vitriol...</a>",1346113247

He is caring after the larger picture, where I am only one of a group of players that he oversees. It's just like an orchestra, you don't expect the maestro to play all the instruments, but you _do_ expect him to know how to drive all the musicians. Having a manager that isn't smart (or whose education level + smarts doesn't meet the threshold of ""can do more than just the mechanical aspects of the job"" is a problem, however.) And as I've never been a developer in Portugal, because, education-wise, I don't qualify to work anywhere in Portugal, I cannot speak specifically how the landscape looks for software developers which during my 10 year stint was one area where a degree was an absolute must. However, as someone above said, there seems to be a lot of business leaders and while this is critically essential, it's unfortunately only a part of the much larger landscape and this is where it needs addressing.",1346112633
4441484,comment,4436867,4440229,5,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Friction is a very complex subject so I won't address it, but other things like the absence of materials that are perfectly flat, perfectly rigid, infinitely strong, etc. are easily explained by the fact that matter is made out of atoms.<p>For example, there's a recurring thought experiment about the limit of the speed of light that goes something like this: say you have a rigid rod that is one light-year long and you push on one end, won't the other end instantly move, thus proving that you can exceed the speed of light? The problem with that is that it's based on an approximate and intuitive understanding rather than a proper understanding of the physics involved. For a short rod if you push on one end the other end seemingly moves instantaneously, giving the illusion of rigidity, but in actuality what is happening is that you are transmitting forces through the rod at the speed of sound in the material, and if you make movements that are slow compared to the time and space involved then everything will appear instantaneous (since the speed of sound in steel is about six thousand meters per second). However, once you scale things up the intuitive approximation is no longer valid. What happens when you push a long rod from one end is that a displacement wave moves along the rod at the speed of sound until it reaches the opposite end, taking far, far longer to move than a signal travelling at the speed of light. Also, no material can be perfectly flat because at the scale of atoms there are... atoms, which are not flat.<p>That's generally the biggest reason why we can't have perfect anything, because stuff is made of atoms and atoms are messy. Often times people who let dreams of perfect materials lead them astray fail to take into account the underlying mechanism for the property they are considering (e.g. rigidity is due to forces being transmitted from atom to atom within a material). A good rule of thumb for whether or not an assumption of perfection is going to ruin a thought experiment is whether or not you're ignoring the underlying mechanism for that process. Another is whether or not you're assuming some arbitrarily small amount that you are omitting from the model because it introduces a ""tax"" that is annoying to account for but that can be easily bounded or instead you are assuming absolute 100% perfection that your whole model is completely reliant upon and even the slightest deviation from perfection would ruin the model.<p>Interestingly enough, there are a few examples of physically perfect things in the real Universe. For example, superconductors experience 0 electrical resistance to current, and superfluid helium does not experience friction internally, and electrons appear to be perfect point-like charges.",1346112560

4441472,comment,4438828,4439503,10,0,cwp,,,"I actually first learned about Semmelweis as an ethical case study. IIRC, Semmelweis did a formal experiment with a control group: only some of the doctors in the First Clinic washed their hands with chlorinated lime; the others deliberately went directly from handling cadavers to delivering babies. The question was whether killing a few innocent women and children in the course of the experiment was justified by all those that would be saved if he proved that washing with lime reduced the death rate.<p>Maybe a better illustration would be Peter Pronovost's efforts to get hospitals to use checklists. His studies show that using a checklist for routine procedures like inserting a catheter dramatically reduces infection rates, saving lives and money. It's such a huge win that you'd think checklists would take the medical world by storm, but that hasn't happened. Convincing doctors to use a checklist requires overcoming their self-image of competence; it's too easy for a doctor to think, ""I know I have to wash my hands before inserting a catheter, I don't need some nurse with a checklist to remind me.""<p>Of course, Pronovost's story is less dramatic than Semmelweis. Pronovost has been more carefully about drawing conclusions from his observations, done a better job of presenting his ideas, and been more successfulhospitals <i>are</i> adopting his methods, if slowly and sometimes grudgingly. He's not likely to die alone in an asylum. To my mind, though, that makes a better illustration of Aaron's thesis.",1346112317

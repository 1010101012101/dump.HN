What's dangerous is if your current success is a fluke, and the process you set up is a recipe to become insular, or a stepping-stone job for SFBA people, or (worst of all) one of those companies you can't work for if you're a mom --- and I know you personally don't want to be any of these things!<p>You are awesome and I'd love to work with you someday.

5365786,comment,5365148,5365148,15,0,freework,,,"I'm going to tell a story that describes why I don't like ""Sunday tests"".<p>Before I became a professional developer, I was a professional pilot who programmed as a hobby. Right after graduating college in 2006, I got a job right out of school working for a flight school. The school specialized in training Chinese people to fly.<p>Anyways, this was back before the economy exploded. There was a shortage of instructors at my school. I was assigned 4 students that I would be teaching mostly one-on-one. Three of the four students were really cool and very likable. The fourth I didn't like at all. Lets just say we didn't get along well. The guy was very difficult, and hard to communicate with. The other three were a joy to work with.<p>If I had the luxury of dumping that fourth student onto another instructor, I would have. But this was back in 2007, and the economy hadn't tanked yet, so there was an instructor shortage, and I had to grit my teeth and deal with this guy.<p>Fast forward to a month later. The tables have turned completely the other direction. The fourth guy who I hated at first was my favorite student. The three students I had liked at the beginning now were the ones giving me the most greif. The extroverted easy to work with likable guys were pleasant to deal with, but they weren't very smart, and I had a lot of trouble teaching them stuff. The fourth guy was hard to deal with, but he was extremely smart and I barely had to teach him anything, he learned everything on his own.<p>Once the economy got bad, the student/instructor ratio fell. The flight school hired a bunch more instructors and got less students. Every instructor got 2 students instead of 4. I made it a habit to go around to all the new instructors and ask them if they have a student they they don't really like working with. 4 times out of 5 the instructor would tell me ""yeah I have this one guy..."" My last 6 months at that job I had 8 students that basically taught themselves. That was easy money.<p>I've found the best way to deal with unlikable people is to just let them go off and do their own thing. The act like that (unconsciously) because they resent you getting in their way.",1363131741

Next the version of C\ninstalled on E was different from that on D.  And\nthe installation on D would not run when E was\nbooted.  Bummer.<p>Next, the C compiler, linker, etc. want a lot of\nenvironment variables.  Fine with me; generally I\nlike the old PC/DOS idea of environment variables.<p>However, apparently Microsoft was never very clear\non just what software, when, could change the\nenvironment variables where.  At least I wasn't\nclear.<p>So, booting from my partition E, the C/C++ tools\nwant environment variables set as in<p><pre><code>     E:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat\n</code></pre>\nOkay.  Nice little BAT file.<p>If run the BAT file from a console window, it\nchanges the environment variables as needed by\nC/C++.  But, in console windows I run a little\n'shell script' I wrote in ObjectRexx.  I has a few\nnice features for directory tree walking, etc.  But\nwhen run the BAT file from the command line of a\nconsole window that is running my little shell\nscript, after the BAT file is done and returns, the\nenvironment variables have been restored to what\nthey were before running the BAT file.  If use a\nstatement, say,<p><pre><code>     set >t1\n</code></pre>\nat the end of the BAT file, then file t1 shows that\nthe environment variable values have been changed\nwhile the BAT file was still running.<p>So, sure, there is a 'stack' of invocations of\nprocesses, applications, or whatever in the console\nwindow and its address space, and, somehow, since my\nshell script was in the stack, when the BAT file\nquit the stack and its collection of environment\nvariables was popped back to what they had been.<p>But eventually I relented, gave up on this little\nproject taking just a few minutes, slowed down,\nthought a little, read some old notes, discovered\nthat I should change the environment variables\nwithin my ObjectRexx script, using an ObjectRexx\nfunction for that purpose, as needed by C/C++ CLG,\nfound the needed changes, implemented them, and,\npresto, got a C/C++ CLG script that works while my\nshell script is running and while I am booted from\nmy drive E.<p>On to the C question:<p>For 'types', the test program has<p><pre><code>     int i, j, k;\n</code></pre>\nFor<p><pre><code>     i = j+++++k;\n</code></pre>\nmy guess was that this would parse only one way,<p><pre><code>     i = (j++) + (++k)\n</code></pre>\nand be legal.  And as I recall, but likely no longer\nhave good notes, some years ago on OS/2, PC/DOS, or\nan IBM mainframe,<p><pre><code>     i = j+++++k;\n</code></pre>\nwas legal.<p>Not now!  With the C/C++ tools with<p><pre><code>     Visual Studio 2008 x86 32 bit\n</code></pre>\nstatement<p><pre><code>     i = j+++++k;\n</code></pre>\ngives C/C++ compiler error message<p><pre><code>     error C2105:  '++' needs l-value\n</code></pre>\nSo, that's an L-value or 'left value' or something\nthat the 'operator' ++ can increment.<p>So, it wasn't clear how the compiler was parsing.\nSo, I tried<p><pre><code>     i = j++ ++ +k;\n</code></pre>\nand it also resulted in<p><pre><code>     error C2105:  '++' needs l-value\n</code></pre>\nSo, likely the ++ that is causing the problem is the\nsecond one.<p>So, I tried<p><pre><code>    i = (j++)++ + k;\n</code></pre>\nand still got<p><pre><code>     error C2105:  '++' needs l-value\n</code></pre>\nThen I tried<p><pre><code>    i = j++ + ++k;\n</code></pre>\nand it worked as would hope:  k was incremented by 1\nand added to j, the sum was assigned to i, and then\nj was incremented by 1.<p>Then I tried<p><pre><code>    i = j+++k;\n</code></pre>\nSurprise!  It's legal!  j and k are added and the\nsum is assigned to i, and then j is incremented by\n1.<p>So, I long concluded that to understand some of the\ntricky, sparse syntax of the language, not clearly\nexplained in K&R, have to write and run test cases\nas here.  Bummer.  But, as below, here I'm\nsignificantly wrong.<p>Possible to make sense out of this?<p>Maybe:  If start reading<p>Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie, 'The C\nProgramming Language, Second Edition', ISBN\n0-13-110362-8, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New\nJersey, 1988.<p>in ""Appendix A:  Reference Manual"" on page 191, then\nhear about 'tokens' and 'white space' to separate\ntokens.<p>Okay, no doubt + and ++ are such 'tokens'.<p>Continuing, right away on page 192 have<p>""If the input stream has been separated into tokens\nup to a given input character, the next token is the\nlongest string of characters that could constitute a\ntoken.""<p>I would have said ""up to and including a given input\ncharacter"", but K&R are 'sparse'!<p>So, with this parsing rule, in<p><pre><code>     j+++k\n</code></pre>\nthe tokens are<p><pre><code>     j\n     ++\n     +\n     k\n</code></pre>\nwhich is essentially<p><pre><code>     (j++) + k\n</code></pre>\nwhich is legal, but in<p><pre><code>     j+++++k\n</code></pre>\nthe tokens are<p><pre><code>     j\n     ++\n     ++\n     +\n     k\n</code></pre>\nwhich would be essentially<p><pre><code>     (j++)++ + k\n</code></pre>\nwhere the second ++ does not have an 'L-value' to act\non.<p>So, my remark that<p><pre><code>     j+++++k\n</code></pre>\ncan parse only one legal way is irrelevant because\nthat is not how the C parsing works.<p>Basically I was assuming a 'token getting' parsing\nrule like I've implement a few times in my own work:\nThere are tokens and delimiters, and a 'token' is\nthe longest string of characters bounded by\ndelimiters but not containing a delimiter.  The\ndelimiters are white space, (), etc.<p>K&R seems to have a point:  My parsing rule would\nhave trouble with just<p><pre><code>     j>=k\n</code></pre>\nand, instead would require writing<p><pre><code>     j >= k\n</code></pre>\nwhich I do anyway.<p>Generally, though, the C syntax is sparse and\ntricky, so tricky it stands to be error prone.<p>Back to writing Visual Basic .NET.",1363131109

It's sad that tests like FizzBuzz are so useful, but it's a fact. If I hire a Java developer for a Java position, I can figure out there Java skills. If I look at a PHP developer, it's more of a crapshoot. They may have a lot of PHP experience, but can they convert that to Java or have they just been doing cargo-cult stuff?

5365675,comment,5365096,5365492,7,0,pjscott,,,"Nice rant, and I mostly agree with it, but there are a few slow things about the ways that some languages are usually implemented that don't really have much to do with over-engineering. Let's take this line of Python code, for example, and look at how the CPython interpreter runs it:<p><pre><code>    return x + 42\n</code></pre>\nThis turns into the following bytecode instructions:<p><pre><code>    LOAD_FAST       0 (x)\n    LOAD_CONST      1 (42)\n    BINARY_ADD\n    RETURN_VALUE\n</code></pre>\nFirst we get the x variable from the local namespace. This is an array of PyObject pointers; the LOAD_FAST oepration simply does an array lookup and puts the result on the stack, incrementing the reference count. Pretty fast. Next is LOAD_CONST, which is even faster; it takes an already-allocated PyObject and puts a pointer to it on the stack, incrementing the reference count. BINARY_ADD removes two numbers from the stack, dereferences the pointers to get the integer values, allocates a new PyObject with the resulting integer inside, bumps up its reference count, decrements the reference count of the two operands, and pushes the result on the stack. Finally, RETURN_VALUE jumps back to the caller of the function.<p>In Go, the corresponding code would be compiled to two, maybe three machine code instructions. There are good reasons why Python does it this way, but it does suffer some inherent slowdown.",1363130337

There's still the possibility of clients without record splitting, there's timing issues in AES itself, there's lots of possibilities for bad server padding implementations.<p>I have TLS 1.2 and AES-GCM working in NSS on my desktop, but we don't currently have the NSS reviewer time to get it landed. We also have to deal with the issue that an active attacker can trigger a version downgrade somehow. (I don't love AES-GCM either, but it's the nearest port in this storm.)<p>In the mean time, I'll probably tweak RC4 in NSS to send one byte records at the beginning of the connection and thus burn off the first 256 bytes of keystream by encrypting MACs. That still leaves a handful of bytes vulnerable, but half of them will be ""GET "".<p>But I doubt that's fully sufficient so AES-GCM is the medium term goal.",1363129458

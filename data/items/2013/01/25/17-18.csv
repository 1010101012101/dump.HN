You still are going to end up with only a single VMA (""virtual memory area"", one of the more insidious costs of memory maps) in your memory map, and only pages you use will get paged in; if you wanted to memory map a 1GB large file, the only pain would be the loss of address space, and you have 2-3GB of that available.<p>Additionally, you aren't even correct that you have to memory map the entire file: as you have a file descriptor for the file and know the offset you want into the file, you can memory map just the part of the file you need. Both the C-level mmap API and the Java-level FileChannel.map API allow you to provide a specific offset and length for the region you want to map from the file.",1359136483

This does not strike me as mean. I'm thinking now though... are you maybe just an emotionally sensitive person? The response is maybe bluntly put, but it is probably sincere and hastily said.

And you know what -- as weird as it may sound, I <i>wish</i> I had received this kind of criticism when I was younger. Too often I was showered with positive comments that I became afraid of non-positive criticism to the point that I stopped taking risks that would endanger my reputation or feelings. It took me some time to learn to just take all criticism and make the best of it: detach the person-element, and just take from it what is truly useful to me, but I'm glad I did.<p>Edit: I'm thinking 'are you maybe just an emotionally sensitive person' may have come off as offensive?

5116653,comment,5115144,5116337,4,0,OldSchool,,,"Some good answers already but I'll add this despite some overlap:<p>Likely a lot more approaches than I can think of are available to an entity with hundreds of millions of dollars with which to place a bet.  I don't know the specific marketplace and id's when you start to get into products like credit-default swaps, but in general the derivative market allows two parties with opposing views of the future to bet against each other.<p>Suffice to say that you would create a position with a ""short"" effect for yourself on the soon-to-be-declining securities: through buying puts (pay now, get cash at expiration if the security's price drops), selling calls (get cash now, bear risk of the security price going up until expiration), shorting a security (""borrow"" it now and plan to buy it back at a lower price later if you win, or a higher price if you lose) or sell a put + buy a call (same risk as shorting only no need to borrow the security and lower cost than simply buying a put, and more upside than selling a call).<p>The difference between institutions and mortals like us is that they are allowed to carry relatively massive positions compared to their capital, presumably because they are supposed to know what they're doing.  So a player with $100M could probably take a $2B short position because of the leverage he's allowed, say 20:1 (probably conservative - I've heard of firms reaching 100:1).  The effect is that a 5% move in the right direction doubles that $100M, and a 5% move in the wrong direction wipes out the player.<p>At least in theory said player's PhD quants in the ""risk management"" department minimize the daily volatility of the net effect of all of the bets placed by different specialists within the organization by placing still more bets.  We've all seen stories of traders taking positions though that somehow didn't get flagged or adequately hedged by risk management.<p>Aside from the rare rogue trader, this obviously doesn't always work and companies ""blow up"" by accruing a loss larger than their capital.  (unless say they're selected to be ""bailed out"" with extra capital)  A ""blow up"" can cascade because of counter-party risk, meaning that firms on the other side of these trades won't get paid.  That's why we had AIG get massively bailed out.<p>Due to SEC regulations however, we mortals are limited to about 2:1 leverage (or 4:1 intraday) for securities.  Options and futures can effect a higher ratio though.  If a retail investor gets squeezed, he must immediately deposit more cash or the brokerage will liquidate it for him involuntarily.  If he still owes, it becomes a debt like any other.",1359136173

5116633,comment,5115465,5116261,6,0,dkarl,,,"You're really stretching the meaning of, ""They want our software to tell them what to do. Period.""  In the real world, as you mention, it makes sense to tell people what to do, because humans usually make better and cheaper robots than robots do, but in computing you only need humans for two things:  physically interacting with hardware, and human judgment.  In my admittedly limited experience in this domain, what people wanted was alerts that indicated that human investigation and judgment were needed.  The systems I worked on only ever told humans to do one thing:  ""Look!  Look at this!""  If the system knew more, it <i>did</i> it.  (A nice feature of one system I worked with was that it automated the routine aspects of investigation, so when an alert was generated, relevant information for the type of alert such as traceroute output and previous alerts related to a host was gathered and attached.)<p>Bottom line:  you never intentionally waste a human's time on things that don't require human judgment, and when human judgment comes into play, people want context.  Good software helps people establish context for the decisions they make.  The bike barometer, for example, doesn't actually tell you whether to bike or not.  It just lets you know how a couple of factors balance against each other.  The person reading the barometer will factor in other context such as how they feel that morning, whether they want some exercise that morning or would rather read a book on the tube, whether the bike is in good working condition, and so on.<p>Granted, the systems I worked with were mostly used by full-time operations personnel.  If you're talking about a system for non-specialists who may need prompting and guidance along the lines of, ""It looks like you're trying to handle more load than usual.  Would you like to spin up a few more servers?"" then I guess I can see people wanting the software to give them explicit orders.",1359135968

Here's the scenario I envisioned after reading your original comment:<p>Say you have 10 people who have committed a crime and under the current system 9 get convicted and go to jail for 10 years and and 1 gets off on a technicality. So, there's collectively 90 years of prison time being served.<p>Now imagine we introduce plea bargaining and offer 5 years to all those accused and all 10 take it. The conviction rate goes up, but the total amount of jail time being served is drastically down.<p>Now I don't know what kind of ""discounts"" plea deals usually offer, or what it increase the conviction rate to, but I doubt it's an ""obvious"" win if you're counting by the number of years convicted offenders are removed from society.<p>Reading your silly answer, I think you're arguing something even less ""obvious"", which is that willingness to commit a crime is a direct function of age. And if that's the case, and if we're measuring benefit by a decrease in one's willingness to commit a crime, well then your system makes sense because any jail time is essentially better than none because the majority of the decrease in willingness to commit a crime happens at the front end of the sentence anyways.

We're in 2013 and the thing draws less ""pixels"" and yet is slower than any 2D scroller from the 80s running on a C64.<p>Sure, it was done in 48 hours and kudos for that... But back in the nineties we'd enter 48 hours or 24 hours ""demo"" competition and come up with stuff incredibly better looking than that.<p>The author of ChromaShift made a talk about the ""Component Entity System"" he's using.<p>And that's where the ""suspension of disbelief"" simply doesn't work for me: everytime he shows the game, it's freakin' ugly and slow as molasses.<p>Then comes the disappointment: if you want to run at a reasonable framerate you, of course, need to perform quite some logic in about 16 milliseconds (the author correctly mentions it in its talk).<p>And... Drumrolls: simply ""iterating"" over a seq made of a hundred elements in Clojure apparently takes more time than that.  Not to mention that if you create objects at every frame then at one point the GC shall have to kick in and your real-time performance will suddenly drop (the author says that in the talk I watched about CES/Chromashift).<p>But why oh why use a language that is very arguable not meant to write video games in (Clojure) to... write a game in it as an example of what can be done!?  (or as an example of how powerful an IDE supposedly is!?)<p>The ""problem"" is that they're talking about that ""CES"" as it was the one way to create games.  But how many games written in Clojure have been shipped?  Heck, how many games written in Clojure are even <i>playable</i>?<p>There are, today, lots of people writing games (either professionals or amateurs) and selling them (or giving them away for free).<p>And not a single one of these game is using that ""Component Entity System"".  And hardly any of them is using Clojure (there may be one or two exceptions but that's about it).<p>And every single of these real games (even the simplest smartphone game) is looking better and is more responsive than the poor examples we see in Clojure talks.<p>So how are we, Clojure believers (I'm a big Clojure fan and investing lots of time and energy learning it), supposed to take any of this seriously?<p>Once again, I don't want to be mean: these guys are typically good programmers but, to be honest, they don't know <i>anything</i> about game programming and that is a bit saddening.<p>EDIT: I won't even start talking about the ""quality"" of the ""text editor"" part of Light Table.  I <i>like</i> the concept of LT but I do wan't a client/server mode where I can plug in vim or Emacs (or Sublime Text 2 or whatever) as my text editor.

Obviously, despite attempts from my family over the years to help her, she is beyond our help.  Money is poured into drugs, she refuses to work, and her mental illness contributes to the problem.  One thing that she, and many, many homeless people I have encoutnered in my visits to shelters, are good at is finding cities that offer handouts and finding a way to get to these cities.  My mother is a member of an entire counter/sub/culture which bounces from city to city, moving when the city's time limit on free handouts runs out.  When conservatives criticize welfare dependency, this is what they point to.  I don't agree with them, but this is a real problem.<p>San Fran draws homeless drug addicts like a moth to a flame.  As a city, the thought is that these programs are a compassionate thing to do.  Enabling drug addiction is not compassionate to the homeless, and it certainly isn't compassionate or caring to the citizens of the city who have to fund this ridiculous garbage.  When you provide a soft landing to drug addicts, you are enabling them.<p>Its not just the Tenderloin.

He was much smaller than me, so it wasn't dangerous, but it certainly would have been bad for a smaller person or a woman.<p>My niece is in fashion school in the city, and has been groped and grabbed by homeless on multiple occasions.  It is out of control, and it gives liberalism a bad name.<p>Are conservative cities assholes to homeless?  Yes.  Do they treat them like human beings?  No.  Do citizens of said cities get harassed? No.<p>Many cities have a middle ground, such as having zero tolerance for homeless intimidating/touching citizens.  If you touch, you are no longer welcome.<p>There are many who would call me heartless.  But when a mentally ill/drug addicted person becomes a predator, and attacks a loved one, they quickly change their tune, especially when they find out that the predator was attracted to their neighborhood by handouts purchased with their own tax dollars.",1359135224

It is the accused who plea bargain.<p>[/IANAL]<p>But I will take a bite at <i>your</i> idealism and for the sake of conversation presume you are speaking of morality and forgo debating whether there is a persistent nexus between one's legal and moral responsibilities - the heart of the Swartz tragedy.<p>When our guilty man bargains in his interest, it is an individual choice. When the government presses for plea bargains in order to reduce the number cases which go to trial, it is a matter of policy - a policy based upon facts unrelated to the guilt or innocence of the guilty man. The policy treats the morally innocent and morally guilty identically. This should give us pause.<p>Our very notions of moral justice require its agents to treat the morally innocent and the morally guilty differently. An agent who treats the morally innocent and morally guilty identically cannot be dispensing moral justice. As such an agent, the government is neither moral nor immoral. It is amoral. The facts of the case cease to matter. Convictions justify the means of coercion.<p>I am willing to accept that some may see this as an ""obvious benefit"" - e.g. Thomas Hobbes accepted the amoral government as the least worse among the alternatives and with such a sovereign, the morally guilty man bargaining for a lesser sentence is always just:<p><pre><code>  ""A Mans Covenant Not To Defend Himselfe, Is Voyd.""\n</code></pre>\nOf course, given Hobbes view of morality, we may be better just sticking with the legal sphere:<p><i>For Morall Philosophy is nothing else but the Science of what is Good, and Evill, in the conversation, and Society of mankind.

Now suppose he's on trial for murder (a crime he is guilty of) and there's a 99% chance he spends life in prison and a 1% chance he spends no time in prison due to a mistrial.  The overall probability he will kill again is ~ 0.7%<p>Suppose instead that we put him in jail for 10 years with 100% probability (ie, a deal that a logical actor would take facing life in prison with 99% probability) and each year he spends in jail his desire to kill decreases by a factor of 2.

You then immediately sell the asset.  Then, on the date certain, you buy that asset back and give it back to the lender.  This is called ""shorting"" and is very easy to do with fungible assets like publicly traded stocks, bonds, or even collateralized debt obligations.  It's so easy and common that <i>you</i> could open up a brokerage account and the broker will actually lend you money to do this.<p>The problem is timing.  Many, many people saw this collapse coming, and most of them got hosed by betting on it.  In the above example, say that you borrowed and sold 10,000 shares of Genworth Financial stock on January 1, 2007 because you knew they were sitting on a pile of bad mortgages and the stock price would tank when the music stopped.  If you agreed to give that stock back on July 1, 2007, you would have lost money, because the stock went <i>up</i>.

Most interesting data exists in only a subset of a large feature set, where most items are irrelevant to the similarity metric.  Take movies for example, if you tried to find similar movies using all features, key grip names and minor actors would unrealistically mess up your similarity score.  This relates to the ""curse of dimensionality"".<p>Many data mining approaches first use a feature selection or feature extraction approach.  That is, an approach which finds the relevant feature subsets, or discovers the underlying features of the data set.<p>Inverse Image search and the solution to the Netflix prize both used feature extraction approaches.",1326722160

I don't think people intentionally want to start an argument many times but since you are always replying directly to someone it can easily be perceived as offensive or defensive even if you are just adding another neutral fact into the conversation.<p>Actually ""conversation"" sounds wrong, because there is no conversation or even common red-line of discussion, just replies to individual comments changing order several times per day based on some rating instead of time. Try returning to a threaded conversation a day after you first read it, you will have to reread almost everything again to get back into the loop again.<p>Flat comment system can also deteriorate quickly when you reach enough users and everything is just lost into a stream of junk like on youtube.

I also found Hong Kong to be way more founder-friendly when it comes to getting angel money or VC.<p>Regarding the police state: 1st time I spent a day in Singapore, in 2005, on a 14h stopover from a long haul flight to Australia, I wanted to take a nap on a lawn in a public park. Two police offers told me I can't and they'll have to fine me but they'd make an exception since I'm a tourist.
I was wearing a tailor-made suit btw., not some daggy traveler attire.<p>That was when I knew Singapore was not for me.<p>Don't get me wrong, I have friends living there and they like it a lot.

The message I got from his body language, nuance, and phrasing was something like ""Obviously people who are elected from heavy technology areas are feeling a lot of heat. There's still a lot of support, though. Let's see if we can tweak this in such a way as to pass some kind of compromise.""<p>Maybe that's just Reid trying to keep the RIAA cash cow alive, not sure. But I was fairly certain that what I was hearing was a tactical retreat, not a strategic surrender. Not by any means. My money says next time they'll have some language in there that could be interpreted a bunch of different ways (to prevent informed debate), and they'll wait until the last minute and sneak it into some other bill that is a ""must-pass.""",1326719060

I am noticing that Hacker News topics are about 5-10% my interests so I thought I would make my own site and post what I find interesting.<p>Plus I find arc interesting and like the interface quite a bit, and could see, with some extensions, maybe building some sort of distributed/connected series of news.arc based sites (think a modern, distributed usenet).  That's just a bit of an idea that I had, but something I might start working towards as I learn me some arc.",1326718897

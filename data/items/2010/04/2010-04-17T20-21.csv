1273703,comment,1273241,1273241,0,0,RevRal,,,"As much as I love video games, I agree with him. I don't think games can technically be art. Though, they are meaningful.<p>You have to draw the distinction somewhere. Art isn't a plastic definition, and it is at least generally understood to describe things that translate into our minds, and expand into something more.<p>The thing that makes a game a game are game mechanics. I don't call game mechanics art in the same way I don't call reality art. Now, I do believe the music in a game can be artful and the story too... but not the thing that makes a game a game. A game is like an enclosure for a lot of wonderful experiences, but I don't see why people are so personally caught up trying to see the enclosure for more than it is. A simulation.<p>That being said, I do believe that video games are a valid medium to spend your time with. A game functions best when the environment plays a large role, something like an archaeological dig. Exploration games like Myst or Shadow of the Colossus use the medium to it's best potential. There is an awe that those games animate through something like osmosis. You absorb the things in games in a way you simply cannot in any other medium. This has value.",1271537966

The musician cannot include visuals, and cannot use sounds that are outside the range of human hearing. The painter cannot use motion.<p>I would argue that limitations are part of what creates truly great art. Specifically, transcending the limitations to create something altogether other, evoking an unexpected reaction. For example, a painting that evokes the <i>feeling</i> of motion is far more impressive than a short clip of an object in motion. We want things that are more than the sum of their parts.",1271537871

Working with XML isn't that hard, true, but even just using jQuery to replace my normal XPath looping-and-plucking was really nice.

1273683,comment,1273568,1273568,0,0,kylec,,,"I, too, hate the decisions Apple has made regarding the iPhone platform. I've already made up my mind that I won't buy an(other) iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad until there's a way for developers to distribute their apps directly to me without the need to be approved by Apple. Granted, this likely means that I won't ever buy one of those devices, but I want to leave at least the possibility of them changing their software and/or policies.<p>Still, when I needed a new laptop, I purchased a recently-refreshed MacBook Pro. Though boycotting the company completely might have been more effective, I still think that my decision to get the MacBook over the iPad (or over nothing at all) sends a message that customers still appreciate the openness of the Mac platform.<p>And it is open - the author of the article talks about installing Linux on his MacBook. If the Mac line were not open, this wouldn't even be possible - just look at how little progress has been made on getting Linux/Android on the iPhone hardware. And on Mac OS X there's also a complete lack of an app review process - I can install any app no matter if it's interpreted or compiled, written in Objective-C or not, and whether or not Apple personally approves of it.<p>It's important to let Apple know what they're doing right in addition to admonishing them for what they're doing wrong.",1271537405

They've been around since the earliest years of civilization. We have played them all that time, but never drew a comparison between them and art like what a painter or musician would produce.<p>Yet, suddenly it became a debate when we got to video games because we could start inserting all the other art mediums as desired, while still retaining the interactive, unpredictable nature of previous games. And so we go out on this mindless quest to find the most moving games we have ever played and show them to the critics.<p>I think that what this suggests is that we have to either expand our definition of art to include all the interactive forms(including toys, board games, and sports) or define two kinds of art - the interactive, and the authorial - and view them as complements to each other.",1271536422

My reaction?<p>“Wow, this guy has some relevant experience, but I don’t really care. He sounds like a huge douche. I don’t want to talk to him, let alone spend most of my life with him.”<p>If you want a tech startup job, you need to remember that experience and skill set won't (and shouldn't) get you hired. Here's why:<p>1) Startups need to add people who care about what they are doing so much that they will do whatever it takes to make their vision a reality. Big companies need to fill specific holes.<p>What this means for your startup application — In your cover letter, focus on clearly explaining what the startup does and why you care about it. Nobody cares about you or your unique experience; you can talk more about that in person. Showing passion for the startup’s vision will get you an interview, guaranteed.<p>2) People who work at startups not only spend more time together than big company employees do, but they also do so under extreme circumstances. One day you will be on TechCrunch and the next day you will be in the trough of sorrow. You need to be able to support each other throughout the roller-coaster ride.<p>What this means for your startup application — Browse the company website to find out whom you’d likely be working for. 9 times out of 10, that person’s email is (first name) @ (startup name) .com. Send your application to them and copy the jobs email on it too. And when you write, treat it like an important email to one of your friends. Use words like “cool” and “stoked” and tell them that you think that you want to be part of the long ride with them. Then, take initiative to get together with them in person outside of the office.<p>3) Startups are busy as hell and, unlike big corporate HR departments, deal with hiring only when they absolutely have to.<p>What this means for your startup application — If your words aren’t there for a specific reason outlined above, don’t send them. Also, if you don’t get a response a week after you send in your info, it’s probably just because the founders are working on other stuff. So, ping them again; it will show that you are persistent and, to be honest, most people just give up after the first try. Don’t stop until you get a clear no.<p>In the end, this is not about your skills, it’s about giving the startup a reason to believe that there is a passionate, cool, and scrappy person behind the pieces of paper you send to them.<p>It ain’t rocket science but, based on all of the applications we receive at Wildfire and [Startup Digest] every day, most people don’t get it.<p>Now, your application will jump to the top.",1271534786

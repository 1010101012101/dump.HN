Sign in using the same account on another device, and your Vesper data will appear on that device.<p>> That’s it.<p>I don&#x27;t get why it&#x27;s mentioned as something special - isn&#x27;t it how it usually works?

Isn&#x27;t it more likely that publishers pay authors well because authors deliver the goods, and would not otherwise?<p>If Amazon was the publisher, why wouldn&#x27;t Amazon also pay a bestselling author well in order to entice that author to produce more/better books, which Amazon can make more money off of?",1401256699

It&#x27;s just as arbitrary, but you just don&#x27;t see it that way because somehow geometry on a line and geometry in the plane are more difficult to distinguish than square roots of positive and negative numbers.<p>Why can&#x27;t people relate to the question of negative square roots? Students ask this question all the time, along with why we can&#x27;t divide by zero and what happens when you do 0^0. Rather than address their questions, you&#x27;re telling then, &quot;Now you have to think about multiplication as a geometric scaling (why? just do it, it&#x27;s &#x27;natural&#x27;), and now we get to add rotations because... it&#x27;s interesting, believe me!&quot; There is more hocus pocus in that than you&#x27;re willing to admit.<p>The problem here is: can we have square roots of negative numbers, and the natural definition arising from an attempt to answer it in the positive is i.  It&#x27;s <i>way</i> more obvious to just declare something to be the square root of a negative number than to try to rack your brain for clever geometric transformations. We do this in mathematics all the time: if we don&#x27;t know what the roots of a polynomial are, we just denote them by a letter and see what we can deduce about them. If you don&#x27;t know whether something exists, you suppose it does and either arrive at a contradiction or don&#x27;t.<p>Plenty of math is invented without motivation. I see it happen all the time. In fact, people will often give a problem or definition motivation after the fact to try to sell it better! I also see this happen regularly, and it all starts with &quot;let&#x27;s invent.&quot; Your gripe seems to be that you <i>do</i> always want the teacher to have the answer, and that every interesting pattern must follow from a non-arbitrary motivation.

Only around 15% of the country is uninsured and only a small percentage of that number would be &quot;dying&quot; at any given time. Most people in that number are young and relatively healthy. There aren&#x27;t huge masses of people dying in the streets from treatable diseases and if that&#x27;s what you believe, you ought to go outside more often.<p>Regardless, as I&#x27;ve repeatedly said, I&#x27;m not arguing for the status quo. The status quo is bad. We do not have a free market currently. If we decoupled health insurance from employers, provided subsidies to the poor, elderly, and our veterans, and removed ridiculous restrictions that prohibit purchase of insurance across state lines we would be well along the way to having a system with universal coverage without the drawbacks of central planning.<p>This isn&#x27;t &quot;ignorant Fox News bullshit&quot;. Central planning has been repeatedly tried and proven to be less successful than the market mechanism we trust with every other sector of our economy. We simply can&#x27;t anticipate supply and demand as efficiently as humans as the market (as a force of interacting people) can. I&#x27;m not trying to spew some reactionary propaganda - for Christ&#x27;s sake, I&#x27;m advocating the government give people subsidies to help them get insurance in this proposed truly free market. Free market doesn&#x27;t mean no government or even no government regulation.<p>The claim that I&#x27;m brainwashed carries significantly less weight when you&#x27;ve ignored my comments up and down this thread.",1401255112

To your arguments:<p>- storing necessities - this is probably the strongest argument that will have to be worked around<p>- cleanliness - is this currently a problem with taxis and rental cars?  I haven&#x27;t had this issue.<p>- style - I think this is true in certain places (I&#x27;m thinking of places like LA where there is a strong car culture) and I think is something that will change as owning a car becomes an unneeded expense.  Think of it like owning a plane.  Sure, it could say something about who you are, but there are cheaper ways to do that.<p>- status - same argument as style<p>- practicality - especially at a larger scale, wait times could be greatly reduced by having more taxis/rentals on the road at any given time, including in the suburbs.  There still would be a lack of convenience, but I think the idea of having an expensive piece of equipment sit idle all day in your driveway for the off chance you need to use it suddenly will seem wasteful.  In fact it&#x27;s wasteful now, it&#x27;s just there isn&#x27;t a good, cheap, and convenient enough alternative to use instead.  A driverless taxi/rental could be that alternative.",1401254690

For example, you have some compound, say DNA, and want to know its molecular shape. I think one of the methods that Rosalind Franklin and company used was to take crystallized DNA, shoot x-rays at it, and study the resulting diffraction pattern(s) to determine that DNA had to be a helical structure with atoms bonding at such and such angles. And if that&#x27;s not clear enough I hope it doesn&#x27;t escape you to note that it immediately suggests a mechanism for DNA replication hah.<p>That&#x27;s hastily written and just tying random facts from undergrad so feel free to correct/add/disprove at will I am sure there are some commenters who know way more in much more detail.

Amazon sold e-books at what some called &quot;predatory pricing&quot;, using their large profits in other parts of their business, to allow them to sell below cost on their DRM-encumbered reading device.  I would guess that close to 90% of e-book reader who purchase books, do so on a Kindle capable device (iPad, iPhone, or E-Ink reader).<p>These people (and I am one of them) - <i>only</i> purchase e-books from Amazon.  Because it&#x27;s DRM encumbered, we need to make sure we purchase content from a supplier who is going to be around 10-20 years from now.<p>Only Amazon (and <i>possibly</i> Apple) has any strong probability of being in that category right now.<p>This gives Amazon an outsized ability to negotiate with vendors - Amazon is close to being a Monopoly for both the ebook purchasers, and Monopsony for the ebook sellers.<p>There was a small chance to correct this back when Apple attempted to negotiate agency and MFN rights for their book selling business, but they did it in heavy handed and clumsy way that appeared to the DOJ to be collusion.  Some have argued that what Apple did with the book publishers was not that different than what Apple did with the Music publishers - the key difference, of course, is that there was no &quot;Amazon&quot; to complain about their market position being disrupted by a new business model.<p>I&#x27;ll still continue to purchase books from Amazon, as distasteful as I find their current negotiating strategy, but I would be (very) happy to see the book publishers decided that DRM encumbered books will ultimately be their downfall because of the negotiating leverage it gives the DRM platform owner.<p>See: <a href=""http://stratechery.com/2014/publishers-deal-devil/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stratechery.com/2014/publishers-deal-devil/</a> for a nice literary analysis of the situation.",1401253326

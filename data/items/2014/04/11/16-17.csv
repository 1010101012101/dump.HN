Most of them will probably work just fine in an office environment at room temperature. But put them in a factory where the temperature near the doors in winter can be below freezing and up near the roof in the middle of summer it&#x27;s well over 100F, then your cheap eBay-purchased sequencing timer starts having hiccups, dumping hot asphalt on the floor.",1397235572

7574059,comment,7573317,7573317,8,0,anonbanker,,,"I like to refer to this as lawyers &quot;pretending to fail&quot;; See, they are being told by their superiors to press a position officially, but to cripple it technically so that it never survives appeal. This allows eventual remedy for the accused, in the form of appeal, while allowing the State actors to promote their high conviction rates for cyber criminals during/post-trial. The state&#x27;s main interest in the publicity of the case is to send a message to the public that cyber crime is taken very seriously, with the aim of deterring future activities of a similar nature by copycats. Weev&#x27;s case being vacated should garner far less attention than the arrest and trial. Everyone but the accused himself benefits from the case, regardless of outcome.<p>As the case is vacated, Weev could still be jailed, dependant on whether or not his legal representation files a motion in the lower court to release him; another classic case of &quot;pretending to fail&quot;.",1397235524

I feel certain that garbage collection and the avoidance of pointers has made programming safer, but I suspect &#x27;duck&#x27; typing has had the opposite effect.<p>In the past, the DOD has been a driver of code safety, though it has backed down from its possibly ill-advised &#x27;nothing but Ada&#x27; position.

The goal of managing this is often to balance availability of taxis with the ability of the taxi drivers/companies to make a profit without gouging the customer. Uber just formalizes the type of price gouging that these regulations are designed to prevent. It&#x27;s consumer-hostile to take a market where fixed prices are the expectation and then say &quot;Oh, well everyone else needs a taxi right now too... so you have to pay more.&quot; I&#x27;m not saying anything about its economic viability, but it makes the user experience of Uber suck ass.<p>More problematic is the attitude many taxi drivers take towards money. Uber assumes that every driver is trying to maximize profit; which is not always the case. In my experience (and I take taxis on a daily basis in many cities) the prevalent attitude is &quot;well I needed to make $800 this week to pay my bills. I&#x27;ve made $800, so I&#x27;m going to stop working and go hang out with my family instead.&quot; Taxis drivers are generally independent contractors, so they can do this. If this happens in a place with a regulated number of drivers, helping them maximize profit quickly reduces the overall availability of taxis, again driving up prices.<p>Frankly, I hate using Uber. Whenever I need it, the price is jacked up to ridiculousness thanks to surge pricing. That makes it unreliable to me because I&#x27;m not paying $50 for a 3 mile cab ride. It&#x27;s gotten to the point where I usually don&#x27;t check Uber anymore.

Waiting tables is the stereotypical student support job (partly because of lectures during the day and people preferring to attend restaurants in the evening), but my understanding is that Amazon warehouses run more or less 24-7.<p>Another way to look at this that doesn&#x27;t require any cognitive dissonance is that Amazon lets hourly employees accumulate up to 2-3 months of severance pay (I&#x27;m not sure how much time that represents because I don&#x27;t know their hourly rates, but I&#x27;m guessing it averages out to something like $12/hour).<p>I think it&#x27;s a great program. Besides offering a friendly incentive for unmotivated workers to leave; it improves the confidence of those working there and provides useful transitional assistance to those moving on for career reasons; lower-paid workers often suffer economic disruption even when moving to a better job because they may miss a pay cycle or have to take on new expenses (new work equipment, different clothes, a car or moving to another town), so a cash cushion for such things is a big plus.

Anecdotally, I&#x27;ve found that their claims about surge pricing mostly hold true: their service, while being priced higher at times of peak demand, seems to generally stay available in a way that cabs or other services don&#x27;t, and at least sometimes, that has been worth it to me, and I&#x27;ve been willing to pay 2x the price to have a ride in ten minutes.  That said, if it weren&#x27;t, there&#x27;s always Lyft or Sidecar (or, for the moment, traditional cabs), which would inevitably offer different tradeoffs of price and dispatch time, and I&#x27;m free to use any of them instead.

If some supporting technical\nmaterial is not easy reading for them,\nthen they believe that they are justified\nin just regarding it as nonsense.<p>But, looking at the partners of A16Z, it&#x27;s\ntough to find one with enough technical\nqualifications and/or accomplishments to\n(A) get a tenure track position in\nthe engineering school of a\nleading research university,\n(B) be an editor of a leading\ntechnical journal of original research,\n(C) publish a peer-reviewed paper\nof original research in a technical field\nin a good or better journal of original\nresearch,\nor (D) get an NSF grant for original research.<p>Net, A16Z apparently is not competent to review\nor even to direct a competent review of\ntechnical material in information \ntechnology.<p>What the A16Z financial performance really\nis is likely not easy to discover.<p>You seem to suggest that the project for\nwhich the OP is some recruiting is for\nan internal information system to\ndo causal modeling and \nmake valuable predictions \nfor venture investing.  It would\nappear that they want to do\ncross tabulation and curve fitting;\nsorry, there is nearly no chance\nthose techniques will work.  Why?\nIn simple terms, they are looking\nfor new, exceptional cases, and\nlooking at &#x27;averages&#x27; from the past,\neven of successes in the past, is\njust intellectual self-abuse.<p>If they are making money, then, fine.\nBut from all I can see, in information\ntechnology their competence is way below\na level that would be useful for \nactual technical work or doing\na technical review of such work.<p>I&#x27;ve been around technical work in\nUS national security, US business\nand start ups, including one of the\nmost successful venture funded companies\never, and high end academic research,\nhold a Ph.D. in engineering from one of\nthe world&#x27;s best research universities,\nhave published peer-reviewed original\nresearch in computer science, applied\nmathematics, and artificial intelligence,\nand in comparison the technical qualifications\nof \nA16Z look like a bad joke.<p>Yes, most good quantitative analysis\nneeds some computing and programming.\nSo, in their recruiting A16Z seems to\nbelieve that the computing, which is\nnecessary, is also sufficient.

7573805,comment,7566069,7567632,1,0,king_jester,,,"> Marriage means subventions by the government.<p>Marriage is not a subvention. You are not granted a cash bonus for being married. You access differences in tax consideration, yes, but that is not the same as getting direct payment. Moreover, there are a variety of legal rights that are available to married couples vs. non-married couple and non straight couples deserve access to those rights just the same as anyone else.<p>> So I suppose you could argue that the subventions are really for promoting families with the ultimate goal of having children. Even though gay families can adopt, you could argue that promoting gay marriage does not bring more children into the world.<p>> Not saying that is my opinion, or that marriage is currently perfectly designed for that goal (after all, childless couples can marry too and get some benefits). But I can understand if people feel &quot;if I am paying for other people&#x27;s marriage, I want to pay for more children being brought into the world in my country&quot; - or something like that. Then I think it would be acceptable to oppose (gay) marriage on that ground.<p>Marriage isn&#x27;t granted or denied to straight people based on their ability to have or not have children, this argument does not hold water. Also, marriage is not strictly about reproducing anyway. Biology-based arguments of this kind is highly discriminatory in general and shouldn&#x27;t be allowed as the basis for law.<p>> It&#x27;s not a question of denying people the right to be together, but a question of what the community should pay for.<p>This is not a question of what the community should pay for, the community would pay less if more overall couples and families were stable, this is a question of discrimination of the most basic kind.<p>> From my European perspective it seems much less ethical to deny people health care (talk about basic human rights), yet I am sure many who support gay marriage are opposed to public health care for a variety of reasons (they don&#x27;t want to live in a socialist country or whatever).<p>That there is a bigger problem compared to gay marriage doesn&#x27;t negate the fact that some people are still being denied the ability to marry and access the rights that come with that status.",1397233295

It makes all the sense in the world to be finding ways we can widely and safely deploy nuclear power worldwide to replace coal and gas power plants. Generating clean electricity is a requisite for wide spread electric or hydrogen cars to stop burning gasoline.<p>If you believe that coal and gas burning is bad for the environment, then we need nuclear power urgently and widely, energy needs are only going to go up and the only alternative to nuclear is burning more fossil fuels. I find it absolutely absurd that people worry more about nuclear waste than atmosphere pollution currently happening. I think we could store a few hundred years of nuclear waste on Antarctica til technology figures out what to do with it, even if that&#x27;s just shooting it into the sun.

There are far better ways to save a few bytes.<p>(By secondary costs I mean things like the myriad bugs caused by null-terminated strings, the severe performance penalties involved in copying and manipulating them, the unfortunate implications they have for file formats and network protocols, etc.)",1397232075

2401621,comment,2399830,2400906,4,0,bigiain,,,"""Suppose the internet has been shut down. I can still hand my neighbor a USB stick. I can still snail-mail my buddy an external drive.""<p>As I see things, there's an important difference there.<p>Just like home taping didn't kill the record industry, and videotapes didn't kill the tv/movie industry, sharing usb sticks or hard drives with your circle of friends isn't going to kill any creative industry either.<p>As is common with computers, the sheer difference in scale of digitally sharing over the internet _does_ make a difference.<p>With physically sharing storage media, there's a small but not zero marginal cost each time you share something. A few bucks worth of usb stick or a few tens of dollars worth of hard drive, which you no longer have use of while your friends has it or it's in transit. That's going to practically limit the sphere of your sharing - think about your own social graph, how many of your ""facebook friends"" would you actually send a drive full of tunes or movies to? I know the subset of my friendlist that I'd go to the trouble to send a few bucks worth of usb stick is a reasonably small portion of the people that Facebook calls ""my friends"".<p>That's a _very_ different thing to what happens when you dump your entire media collection into the /torrent directory on your always-on campus network connected machine. The internet enables zero marginal cost sharing, which inevitably leads to orders of magnitude wider sharing. I suspect the Dunbar number of ~150 real social connections is the very top end of what most people would consider to be a sensible sized physical-media-sharing-network, and realistically most people would probably stop short at 10 or 15 individuals you'd expend the effort to share with if sharing required you to actually send real-but-small-cost atoms to do it.<p>(curiously, or perhaps obviously, these suspicions about sharing network sizes closely map my personal experience ~30 years ago with sharing compact cassettes and vinyl LPs in highschool in the early/mid '80s. There were 6 or 8 people who I'd lend/borrow LPs between, and perhaps a dozen more that I'd lend or copy tapes for.)",1301799238
2401620,comment,2398782,2400257,4,0,cturner,,,"I was thinking about last night. I see logic in it. (1) Target the people who you have best hope of affecting the behaviour of. (2) Avoiding compounding damage to people who are already messed up.<p>Prostitution attracts girls who are already degraded. It's common for the girls to have been sexually abused as a child, physically abused as a young wife, or to have drug issues. Participation in the trade suggests that the person is not a full-functioning citizen.<p>A motivation for outlawing prostitution is paternalistic: it's a dynamic that causes this a concentrated group of people with existing problems to spiral further.<p>Using the legal system to target people in that situation for their own good is counterproductive. They have low faith in government and institutions already, and jailing them probably isn't going to help that. You just end up pushing them into and out of new institutions, but they keep practicing because the business is there and they don't take control of their lives to rise out of it.<p>Whereas the business that fuels prostitution is vulnerable to the dynamic of the police and legal system. Users are usually people who are full participants in society and are vulnerable to shame and the threat of jail time. They generally have a good understanding of rights/responsibility even if they have periods where they hold themselves to be above it.<p>I sometimes read that prostitution is ""misogynistic"". It's not. For the most part the users don't think about the circumstances of the girls at all. Some people don't naturally behave with concern for other people's circumstance, and the stick attempts to compensate for that.",1301799173

My friends and I were discussing it the other day, and I made the analogy of comparing the connectome in your brain to hardware and the thoughts in your mind to software. Is that a fair analogy?<p>David Rock wrote a book called 'Your Brain at Work' where he says that insights come from detecting weak associations (he gave a Google Tech Talk on this too -- <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeJSXfXep4M"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeJSXfXep4M</a>).<p>If the brain software/hardware analogy is right, is there a similar relationship between weak associations of thoughts and neurons that are ""distantly"" connected? In other words, are associations weak because they are indirect paths from one node – one neural connection -- to another, and would a more direct path optimize you mental ability?""<p>This is what Sebastian said:<p>""The hardware-software analogy is wrong<p>1) the brain is not a general purpose programmable computer. different areas are specialized to different functions<p>2) the connectome changes over time, unlike hardware<p>you're right that direct vs indirect paths do matter, unlike in communication networks. but the weakness of an association might have to do with the strength of synapses, not just the length of the path. i'm addressing these questions in my book which will appear in feb 2012 if all goes well.""<p>So maybe a better analogy for the brain would be a network of specialized computers, like a private cloud connected to the Internet because the cloud can change with demand, and the size of connection and number of hops both affect performance.<p>For example, pushing data closer to the client is one of the primary reasons CDNs (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network</a>) were invented -- to optimize content delivery so content is fewer hops away from the client.<p>And in graph theory a common problem is trying to find the shortest path from one node to another (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem</a>).",1301798883

But I think you still have to admit that the pressure exists, and keeps some women who otherwise would succeed out of the business and out of Open Source.<p>Myself, and most of the girls I know, were raised to be ""ladies.""  That means that skills like cooking, drawing, and playing classical instruments had a higher value placed on them than computer hacking or coding skills.  Just as you say, many of use don't learn to use a computer until we reach college and have to start writing essays (for our acceptable ""girly"" majors: I chose to major in French because I didn't even feel like computer science was an option for me at the time I entered college.) \nIt's girls like this who need the support of a female community before they can feel comfortable enough to dive into programming.  No matter how talented, not all girls are going to be able to write their first code at age six because parents often actively discourage their daughters from spending time in front of the computer - just look at the comments your neighbors made!  My own parents frequently booted me off the computer so that I would go practice violin, etc.  My brothers on the other hand, were allowed to use the computer and often received tech-related items as presents.  For whatever reason, computers are still perceived as a boy's plaything rather than a girl's plaything.<p>While I don't think shaming men is going to solve this problem, I do think there needs to be a supportive community that welcomes women into the tech world, which is exactly the point of Gina Trappani's article.",1301798690

Attackers can still brute force a key, but it's a pretty unlikely scenario. If you've got SSH, then you won't need FTP or any other admin ports open. Even more secure would be to VPN directly into the data center and access your servers over the internal network only - though that's probably overkill for most purposes.<p>I wouldn't put too much trust into obfuscation techniques such as using non-standard portnames and URLs.<p>Backups are of course deadly important. There are a million things that can kill or corrupt your servers. Most of the time, you don't really need to use an online service for that. Another machine somewhere in the world capable of cron, SSH and rsync will almost always do the trick.<p>It is also a good idea to establish mechanisms that enable the servers to alert you of strange things going on. For example, you can set up the system to message you every time a remote login takes place. If it's you, you can discard the notification. If it's not you, you know instantly that you've got a problem.",1301796983

We still have intellectuals today like Friedman who fly as much cover for murderous totalitarian regimes as they can; it hasn't even <i>stopped</i>. Intellectuals are yet to give up Marxism, despite what it actually does. It flatters them so, a toxic meme that can only strike the smart.<p>It wasn't every last person everywhere who might have called themselves an intellectual, but it sure <i>wasn't</i> ""the common man"" reading Marx and deciding to break out the pitchforks. ""I am a barely literate peasant and I demand the immediate centralization of all power into the government so it can be run by the intellectual elite, create a single central bank, eliminate my religion, abolish my private property, remove my means of communication into centralized control of the state, and write glorious Five Year Plans so I can stop farming potatos!"" They provided a driving force for change, but the change itself was controlled by intellectuals.<p>""Intellectuals"" may not be solely responsible, but they weren't even remotely innocent, and it is entirely irrational to pretend that intellectual ideas not accompanied by humility and an intense effort made to discover whether those ideas are actually true before making grand pronouncements that move countries have not had massive negative impacts in our world today.<p>""one of our major political parties and it's major financial backers hate the policy implications of some important scientific conclusions""<p>I assure you Democrats are equally prone to it. If you think the Democrats have been some great boon to true science it's only because you're a Democrat yourself. As neither Republican nor Democrat, neither <i>political</i> party (emphasis ""political"") has particularly impressed me with their devotion to scientific truth. Though I will concede the Democrats have done a great deal better job pretending in the past decade, at least inasmuch as it was politically convenient.<p>And remember perception really matters here. You may refuse to chalk up these actions to ""intellectualism"" no matter what contortions you have to go through to account only good to its cause and discard the evil, but those of a ""simpler, less intellectual"" bent won't go through those contortions, and that's not necessarily irrational. It's no great wonder ""I'm an intellectual and I'm here to give you the answer!"" isn't something that makes an American drop everything to listen.<p>(And they have done great good, too. One Norman Borlaug can offset an awful lot. But it's not a path to an accurate picture of the intellectual history of the 20th century to take credit for Norman but dance away from, for example, Eugenics, to name just one problematic entirely-intellectual idea, and what it wrought.)",1301796414

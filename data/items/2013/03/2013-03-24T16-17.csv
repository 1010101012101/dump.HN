5432620,comment,5429824,5430257,1,0,betterunix,,,"""What would happen if teachers were not unionized and had to compete for their jobs?""<p>That only makes sense if the schools are all private.  Keep in mind that public schools are not for-profit institutions, they are constantly at the mercy of the government.  Without unions, what you get is a system that pits individual teachers against the government itself, which means each individual teacher is now at the mercy of the mob.  Unions have their flaws, but it would be far worse if teachers had to constantly worry that the latest political climate will cost them their jobs or their salaries.<p>""My gut feeling is that the rich have nothing whatsoever to do with the problem""<p>Your gut feeling is wrong.  Wealthy people spend a lot of time ensuring that their children receive a quality education; few volunteer to improve the education of the poor in any meaningful way (like ensuring that the poor learn enough to attain any real power).  Wealthy people oppose stronger progressive tax systems, but have little to say about public lotteries and other regressive taxes.<p>The entire system of credentialism -- the use of a degree to judge a person's merit -- is an invention of the wealthy, and it is by far the most destructive force in education today.  The idea that one must be educated in order to be employed has been pushed by the employers themselves, and those employers are generally owned and controlled by rich people.",1364144365

The band-aid itself has an elastic reservoir in the center that fills up just like a condom's. That way you'd have pretty much all your sensitive parts still directly exposed. The main challenge would be a user-friendly way of cementing that sucker to the head of the penis though. Bior pore strips are ridiculously clingy to skin (don't ask how I know), but take a while to apply. Maybe something in that vein?  Would probably need something that chemically reacts/bonds to skin (a band-aid's level of stickiness just wouldn't be enough), but is soluble in some other gentle chemical.",1364144319

Most poeple, besides uk, germany and scandinavia, in Europe work less and complain much more than in america (also because they have more weight,rights & insurances).

Lithium Ion batteries can already max out the power offered by the 10W charger that comes with the iPad and charging off computer USB is often slow (USB is current limit).

A Tesla supercharger charges 40/85kWh in LiIon battery capacity in 30 minutes (from empty, it gets harder to push charge in as they get full). They use off the shelf batteries.<p>But the dirty little secret is of course that it's not necessary. You need one day of battery life, then people get home and charge it by their nightstand.

5432588,comment,5432506,5432506,1,0,kls,,,"<i>American employers relied increasingly on independent contractors, temporary workers, contract employees and freelancers to cut costs.</i><p>I think the article approaches the story from a particular vantage point. But for me personally, as freelancer and a substantial earner, I tend to not identify with the idea that we are part and parcel abused. It may be what I came from (poor farm family) that gives me a different perspective. But I have found corporate America to be fairly generous, you just have to ask. Which brings me to the above quote, while I do belive employers utilize independent contractors in some instances to cut cost, what I have found in many of the situations I have been in, is that it is a tool used to identify cost up front and to mitigate risk, usually companies are willing to pay a small uptick in cost to reduce a huge downsize risk and employees and employes health both represent substantial risks to a company.<p>I think where we as individuals go wrong is in charging rates similar to those of employees and then taking on the risk the companies does not want to shoulder on top of it. When the reality is, we should be asking to be compensated for that risk (just as insurance companies are) and we should be willing to walk away from a company that unreasonably expects up to take on their downside bet with no upside of our own.<p>What I don't believe that high earning potential people need is collective bargaining. That being said, what the article discusses sounds like they are more of a health care co-op than a employment union bargaining with employers and I am all for that. Health care co-ops help us offload that risk onto a proper entity, employers where never really the correct entity to deal with that risk in the first place.",1364143964

5432558,comment,5431842,5432482,2,0,RyanZAG,,,"Great points. I think that helps me fill in a few gaps in what Samsung might be thinking here.<p>Google has threatened that Samsung lose support if they fork Android. They might or might not actually do it - Samsung is a major Android player. The threat is still enough that Samsung have chosen not to try forking Android.<p>However, Samsung still wants more control. The solution is to use Tizen with Android compatibility to try and wrest that control from Google, but while still acting within the boundaries Google have given them. If Tizen doesn't take off then Samsung can just fall back on Google Android. If Tizen does take off, then they now have enough weight to push Google around as they wish.<p>Google isn't worried about Tizen as they believe that Samsung will not be able to out code them, and that Android apps running on Tizen will not be as good as Android apps running on Android. While I'm sure that Google would prefer if Samsung wasn't trying out Tizen, they believe they have a strong enough bet that Tizen will fail and Samsung will come crawling back anyway.<p>So the whole situation now makes a lot of sense from both Google and Samsung's side. From this we can probably take away that Tizen will get the best hardware first to give it more chance of taking off. Also, Google is likely to try and add new services in future Android versions that will make it more difficult to run Android apps on other platforms. Interesting and falsifiable, in a year's time we can see if these predictions are true!<p>Anybody think I've got way on/off track here?",1364143465

I guess that makes me a hero in this thread.<p>The professor uses mediation to hone focus, then hyperfocusing on a task. It sounds a lot like a fancy description of the Pomodoro technique, except that the argument is that meditation can extend the amount of time we can give to a task. The other central argument is that we can't actually multitask, and it does more damage to try. The point of not being able to read a whole book seems like bunk to me, though, since I read for recreation, and it takes the amount of time it takes. I can't sit and read a whole book, just like I can't sit and watch a whole season of a television show.<p>I don't buy in to Pomodoro since I think it hurts to force a time limit in either direction, but I do believe that hyperfocus helps get tasks done. I notice this most of all when coding. I will fall in to a deep zone and just go. Eventually, something will bring me out of it (either hitting a wall, or finishing a block of functionality, etc), and that's it for a while. I will toggle out to Facebook or something and recover. Eventually, I'll go back. This cycle has been successful enough for me, just not forced to 25 minute blocks.<p>The one big point I did agree with is that, in a way, I have become a slave to my phone.

Samsung's software prowess is nowhere near to companies making and capable of making world class/sophisticated OS(or mobile OS). There is a lot of things that goes against Samsung which is in the company's DNA (culturally embedded it) and those are the things that hinder innovation and cutting edge research(esp. from s/w research perspective). (Probably the same things actually help them do great in the numbers game and on factory floor)<p>And even if it does. Samsung is the one vendor that actually sells Android phones - those millions of phones and I am sure Google gets a cut from it, not to mention ads and other ways of monetization. So, it is unlikely Google is denying them early code access. Other OEMs have failed on one more front - providing upgrades and this is where Samsung beats them all (except Nexus line; last 2 Nexus were from Samsung BTW). HTC makes good phones(better than Samsung IMHO, at least some models) but their users are doomed on upgrades. LG is not even worth mentioning. We have their phones in test lab and almost they all suck. We've yet to see where Moto goes and what it does. I guess Google will try to pull an Apple with Moto(though it's just a guess, I've no solid backing for this argument). Sony just keeps trying to make their devices all the pretties and they end up screwing the overall design and their s/w support is even worse than LG.<p>Tizen is not fragmenting Android. I also had doubts about it and talked to the guys working in that team and they explained it doesn't.

under a throw-away account. I can share some feeling with the author, but
there's <i>no way</i> I agree that you can be <i>happier</i> with chronic pain.<p>I've been also suffering from chronic pain since I was ~20. I remember it
started with mild focusing problem: I would feel unable to concentrate, and
every ~60 seconds or so I would have a sensation of disorientation that would
break my train of thought. Sounds innocent. I also thought that too, until it
started to get worse and I had to start looking for medical advice.<p>I carried on, even though you can imagine that even though there was actually
no pain, it's incredibly debilitating. At some point it got so bad, I remember
I had occasions where I would feel ""lost"" in the middle of a room, I would try
to remember what I was doing but as I was doing that I would re-start from 0,
and ask myself: what was..? Fortunately it wouldn't last for very long (maybe a
couple of minutes),and I actually never lost the ""memory"", I would just be
unable to think.<p>I still believe this was the onset of everything that followed. This feeling
got less and less frequent over the months. After 3 years I didn't have any of
those ""lost in a room"" moments. But as this feeling disappeared, I started to
have tingling pain in the fingers, that later extended to the whole arms. I
later (after <i>years</i>, medical examinations, etc) discovered that what was
actually happening was muscle stiffness in the forearms, then neck, and then
the whole body, which created varying levels of suboptimal blood circulation,
and subsequently increased stiffness resulting in a negative feedback loop.<p>At various times, I had rippling muscles, like this:
<a href=""http://youtu.be/vKgFtIbCzcg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/vKgFtIbCzcg</a><p>Some other times I could strike any muscle with a finger with minimal force,
without pain at all, and it would form an isolated contraction, so small I
could actually <i>draw</i> shapes on the biceps, which is something I would have
always fun doing to show doctors.<p>But the biggest problem became very soon to be pain. Everywhere. Due to
stiffness, fatigue, or whatever. I was doing piano lessons since a couple of
years, but I couldn't take it anymore. After a session I would feel stiffer, I
couldn't articulate the fingers smoothly as I could at the beginning of the
lesson itself. It was something that I loved, and the more I tried the more I
would feel powerless. Very, very slowly I stopped doing any piano entirely,
because I would only feel enraged, bad, and depressed.<p>I had to slow down work. A lot. Typing became a serious issue. I switched
countless keyboards. I would before ""think while typing"" and correct/fix the
code along the way. I now ""think before doing anything"".<p>One of the things that I always liked was hiking. I hiked a lot, 3-12 hours,
any elevation gain, any distance, no problem. I could hike slowly and think, or
I could just as well hike to stop thinking, which is also incredibly effective.
It's the perfect stress/pain valve, until last year I started having the same
issue in the legs too. Again, very slowly. Sometimes I would just feel tired,
and recover quickly. But over time the recovery took longer and longer, until
now it seems that I cannot properly recover even from mild activity.<p>The biggest ""a-ha"" moment for me was two years ago, when I stopped doing piano.
The author of the post says it's ""happiness"" and enjoying the small things. I
don't think so. For me it was the moment I gave up. I tried <i>fucking hard</i>
doing everything I could to fix the issue. I spent literally everything I had
on medical doctors, visits, etc. I tried alternative medicine. I explored every
detail I could, and failed. At this point you just let go, and accept the
problem as it is. I'm basically forced to care for the issue, otherwise I
wouldn't work at all, but does this make me happy?<p>I'm sorry, but no. I'd give you <i>anything</i> so I don't have to suffer
continuously, so that I could do piano again, or hike without having to worry
about pain later, or even sit at the computer without feeling pain.<p>The way I work now is very different. When I want to work on a problem, or do
any activity, I have to focus hard, ""zone out"" completely if you will, to the
point that anything beyond the problem at hand has any space. It's hard to do.
But you can become good at it, like everything else. And it's not a method for
stress relief, because the moment you ""let go"" the pain is brought back too.<p>Maybe I'm missing the enlightenment the poster had. But chronic pain is
incredibly debilitating. I have moments were I really feel handicapped, even
though I can literally do everything. Chronic pain is bad guys, there is no ""good"" that I can think of :(.",1364141320

5432419,comment,5431894,5431894,4,0,mythz,,,"Reposting my comment here so it can serve as a discussion point if wanted...<p>Kind of weird that most of the problems identified that are being identified are actually language features that end up making code smaller and more concise, which are languages features that can be optionally used or not. I get the feeling that most of the <i>disadvantages</i> listed here are just things that are done differently and you are used to having to do in node.js because of limitations in the language, that you've later found and attached some benefits to, rather than ideal language features with merits that stand on their own.<p>Seems weird that a declarative module/import system can be viewed as a bad thing, node.js require is done the way it is because that's the most concise way it can be done in node.js without an in-built module system.<p>Creating more boilerplate by exposing a function is easier to read? I'm just not able to follow the logic here.
You can easily identify what dependencies a package has and what it exposes by looking at the header of each library which maintains it in a concise, readable and declarative form - again another area where I can't see how having exports litered throughout the code-base which devs need to scan the whole code-base to find can be considered an advantage.<p>Being able to split out your source files by using library/part is a blessing, which is similar to using partials in C#. i.e. we're not artificially forced to create new classes and abstractions/delegations because the source code is getting too big, as we can group different parts of a library into cohesive and logical parts, that has no effect to the external surface area of the API.<p>I find Batteries included for core functionality is a great win, instead of using/finding adhoc libraries to do the same thing, you can instead use the built-in libraries that are always well thought out and written in idiomatic dart that provides a consistent development experience across the entire platform. The libraries also smoothes out browser quirks behind a consistent API. Not having built-in collections, or not having all async APIs return Futures makes composability harder since different libraries will import and implement their own, and using adhoc libraries that don't follow the same conventions, unnecessarily increases institutional knowledge that is a productivity drain and a source of bugs.<p>Tree-shaking encourages the developer to be lazy and is why it shouldn't be used?<p>This defies logic, wasting time and being forced to find and use minimal libraries not because of technical fit but because of how much your application uses and how much it adds to the overall download size - has only downsides. This developer time-sink exercise is just an artificial complexity that doesn't add any benefits to the end-user. Knowing that your production code will be tree-shaken and optimally packaged for deployment means you can maintain the most optimal development environment you wish as your code will be in its most optimal form when its deployed, so you're free to reference the most suitable library, use as much or as little of it as you need without concern about resulting code-size, which ends up having a smaller output than having hand-picked micro libraries since only the parts of the library that you end up using gets deployed and not the entire library.<p>One of the benefits I got when using the Closure Library (i.e. what Gmail, Google Maps were built-on) was the vast array of well-tested and robust libraries that I could use without any concern of its deployment footprint, being able to freely use any library you wish is what Tree-shaking allows.",1364140976

Drug resistant TB is highest in ""the former USSR, the Baltic states, Argentina, India, and China, and was associated with poor or failing national tuberculosis control programmes"". Some 10-40% of the people who take antibiotics don't finish a course of treatment because they are feeling better and think they don't need the hassle any more.<p>The WHO and various countries including the US say there is an association with antibiotics in animal feeds and an increase in antibiotic resistance in human diseases. This has nothing to do with ""doctors pushing antibodies.""<p>Drug resistant staph was first found in the UK. Do doctors in the UK face the same pressure to justify their so-called offensive office visit fees?",1298386719

2250021,comment,2249604,2249841,0,0,ugh,,,"The point is probably that the withdrawal of Soviet support is what connects all the revolutions in 1989 and 1990. Soviet tanks no longer came rolling in and crushed the revolts like before, in 1953 (East Germany), 1956 (Hungary) and 1968 (Czechoslovakia). There is, like in 1848, no such a central fact that connects all Arab revolutions.<p>I think that’s a pretty superficial search for similarities. We don’t yet know how the revolutions will work out and there are not that many examples in the history of revolutions spreading from one country to the next like wildfire. (I can actually only think of 1848 and 1989/1990. Does anyone know more?) To what extent comparisons to 1848 and 1989/1990 make sense at all is certainly questionable.",1298386699

If an HTML5 app meets consumers' needs, then there's no need for a native app.<p>But the crux of this entire debate is whether users will demand iOS versions of applications.

It was also the source of court cases which set precedent for walled gardens.   If I remember correctly, Atari ROMs had an image in them that the firmware checked for before allowing the ROM to run.   But the image was copyrighted, so you couldn't sell Atari ROMs without giving a cut to Atari.  The only exception was Tengen, who had a historical license due to being a spin-off of Atari.",1298386648
2250015,comment,2249133,2249133,0,0,gus_massa,,,"There are some extrange detals in the original paper.<p>For example the experimental points in the graphics do not have error bars. The x axis is 1/temperature, so the error should be small. But in the y axis I spect that the measures have a more visible error. Some of the graphics (""Protein A"", ""L9"") have a very good theoretical fitting, so it is possible that the experimental data have very small errors. But in others graphics (""Engrailed Homeo Domain"", ""Trpcage(WT)"") the points are scattered around the theoretical fitting, so perhaps the measures have a appreciable error or the theoretical fitting has problems.<p>And in the lasts graphics the fitting is not very good. In particular in ""Villin Headpiece Subdomain"" the fitting id horrble. I see that the experimental point lie in something like an ""U"" but the fit is like a shallow ""^"".<p>Another problem is that they have too many free parameters: ""R"" and ""S"" are free. And ""Tc"" is free too (it is an experimental value, not deduced from the model). But near the maximal point of the curve, everything is almost a parabola, so with 3 free parameters it is possible to fit almost everything. For example, for the first graphic (""Protein A"") a possible fit using thee parameters is<p><pre><code>  ln(K_1)= -7.4161 * (1000/T - 3.1469)^2 + 12.418
</code></pre>
They have a more difficult functional dependency, but with tree free parameters it is not clear that they have the correct model.",1298386634

Sometimes you get a good GPS signal (e.g. outside, clear view of the sky etc.), sometimes you don't, and you position could be off by 10m. Some GPS store the accuracy of each track point (e.g. VDOP and HDOP), some don't. If your GPS doesn't store the accuracy, then someone could claim your GPS is off by 20m, and hence you were speding (or the data is unreliable).",1298386598

My point is that even with licensed OS users should be free to do whatever they want on the device.

2249890,comment,2247560,2249571,0,0,Tyrannosaurs,,,"Singapore - arguably the most efficient healthcare system in the world.  Tim Harford talks about it in his excellent book ""The Undercover Economist"" (worth commenting that he's not rampantly free market - he spends time putting the boot into the US system too as well as praising the UK's NHS).<p>Basically everyone has to maintain a fund (the government pay into it for the poorest) for healthcare.  This is what they spend when they have healthcare needs.<p>Because the people are making the purchasing decisions themselves (as opposed to the insurance company doing it) they have a far stronger incentive to demand value and to be informed, and you get genuine competition between providers (as if you don't like them this time you'll go elsewhere next time with no insurance company mandating who you can see).<p>The government then picks up the few areas that aren't well catered for by this system.<p>I think it costs about 40% of what the US system costs (possibly even less) and Singapore has a typical life expectancy of 80.",1298383763

People either let them lapse where possible, declare bankruptcy to get Constables off their backs, or spend years paying $50-$100/mo.<p>Things like this happen even to insured people. Due to a communications snafu between the doctor and the insurance company, my mom, who has ""good"" insurance from BigCo, is paying for her annual mammogram $50/mo now, and will be doing this for the better part of two years.<p>My parents paid on an ER visit I made in my late teens until I was 21 or 22 because of another such insurance oversight.<p>These happen all the time because that's how insurers make money. The insurance model is based explicitly on <i>not</i> paying out. For something that's universally utilized like health insurance, that generally means you have to deny a lot of claims to keep acceptable margins.<p>Homeowner's insurance works fine because most people aren't burglarized often and most peoples' homes don't burn down, so people make modest monthly payments and one claim in a lifetime more than pays for itself. Likewise, car insurance is not used too often by its patrons.<p>Health insurance, however, is used (at least) several times a year by almost every individual. As such, insurance is a terrible model for health care, since the entire concept behind insurance is that more people are paying for the coverage than are using it. The continued feasibility of medical insurance depends on people not getting medicine.",1298383617

2249881,comment,2247560,2247969,0,0,goatforce5,,,"The Medicare system in Australia works in a sort of similar way to how you describe Japan. The government publishes a list of fees for every possible procedure and treatment. The medical service provider can ""bulk bill"" where they collect the money directly from the government, and the patient never hands over any money. Alternatively, the provider can charge whatever they want (because they're a noted doctor, or their office is in an expensive location, etc.), and the patient can then claim the set amount back from Medicare.<p>Bulk billing is so much more convenient for everyone that you'll see signs advertising it on the outside of doctors surgeries, thus the cost of care is kept down. On the other hand, the doctors are free to charge what they want. Sounds like a fair way to do it.",1298383324

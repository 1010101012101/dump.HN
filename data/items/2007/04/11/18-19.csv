11997,comment,11915,11915,0,0,mattculbreth,,,"Completely depends on what you're doing--what kind of app you're building.  A very good middle step is a VPS, which looks like your own server (full root, shell access) but is actually a virtual server on another box.  With the latest virtualization in Linux this is a really good way to get cheap computing power.<p>You can even get hosting companies to provide fully managed servers, which means you just give them the app and they make sure it's always running and healthy.",1176316950

It is close to beta, and I wrote it in Swing, Java. However, people say it is not user friendly. I have also lost a lot of time (in part, because I am cautious and also had bad advice. I should have released it long ago).<p>I am willing to give you a one hour online demo/presentation. However I would need some kind of assurance from you that the ideas will not be copied nor given or divulged to potential competitors.<p>Please email me and tell me more about yourself and if you think there might be a good match.<p>thanks,<p>Anil Philip<p>anil@juwo.com<p><a href=""http://juwo-works.blogspot.com/"">http://juwo-works.blogspot.com/</a><p><a href=""http://juwo.com"">http://juwo.com</a> <p>I am in Kansas City.

Sure, some of them promote interesting discussions, but I think that if they somehow didn't give karma (obviously a hard problem), submissions like this wouldn't pop up as much.",1176315545

11980,comment,363,363,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Add Classifications:<p>With the speed that articles drop from the system, and the probable increase in discussions that may have already happened, it sure would be nice if articles could be classified (i.e.: Funding, Infrastructure, Programming, Startups, etc etc), so that users could hit on the class their interested in to see what was discussed in the past. The startup bar could get an added heading like ""categories"" that would then let the user select. You could allow user based classification at the article and comment level to feed the categories. Maybe you could let the leaders add new categories (preferably a hierarchical structure)",1176315110

One particular meeting I had to ask a speaker to leave the premises (hosted in my employers building) for displaying bared breasts during his talk. Unsurprisingly, people walked out.

3163418,comment,3162352,3162352,4,0,ajtaylor,,,"At $work in Australia, we went through this a couple months ago. After an initial quote that was beyond ridiculous, we worked out a much better deal with the local Google reseller. In addition, to help keep map views down we stopped unconditionally loading the map. Instead we have a placeholder image which when clicked loads the maps API dynamically. Google's fine with this behaviour as long as we don't use  their map image.<p>We looked at other map providers, and in particular Bing and TileStream/OSM. But Bing's cost was 1) nearly what Google wanted and 2) confusing to try and get an actual price because there are about 10 different ways to get a Bing maps license. OSM ended up being ruled out because 1) we weren't confident in the data quality in India and Malaysia and 2) I couldn't find an easy way to geocode.<p>I wish I had known about the Mapstraction project freyfogle mentioned. I would have seriously considered using it since we were already moving from v2 to v3 of the Google Maps API. Future proofing our maps implementation would have been nice.",1319727593

This board is the Arduino of the FPGA world.  There are tutorials from many schools, lots of good documentation, it's a proven design...you can't go wrong with the Basys board.  It does sacrifice performance for simplicity, though - Notably, there's no RAM except for what's on the FPGA.  Go up to the Nexys for that, but if you're just interested in learning Verilog/VHDL, the Basys is a fine place to start.<p>To learn how <i>these things</i> work, get a job at a company which uses FPGAs. You'll probably never see one of these parts as a hobbyist.<p>If you're interested in stuff that's actually like this, and want to start right away, then look for a board packaged as a PCIe card.  This will be significantly more expensive; think $500 on the extreme low end.  NetFPGA is (<a href=""http://netfpga.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://netfpga.org/</a>) is a good starting point if you're trying to start at a higher level. (Note that the old board is 33MHz PCI and the processor is obsolete; you want the 4x10GBE Virtex 5 part if you're looking for modern tools)",1319727418

I approached it slightly differently than this article; I implemented a RPN stack machine evaluator, and a recursive routine which permuted first over operators, then operands; the core routine looked like this:<p><pre><code>    static int FindSolutions(int[] numbers, int numberIndex, int stackDepth)\n    {\n        int result = 0;\n        if (stackDepth == 1)\n            if (Evaluate(g_program.Program) == g_target)\n                ++result;\n        // Try the operators (all are binary here)\n        if (stackDepth > 1)\n        {\n            for (OpCode opCode = OpCode.Add; opCode <= OpCode.Div; ++opCode)\n            {\n                g_program.Push(opCode);\n                result += FindSolutions(numbers, numberIndex, stackDepth - 1);\n                g_program.Pop();\n            }\n        }\n        \n        if (numberIndex < numbers.Length)\n        {\n            // Try each number\n            for (int i = numberIndex; i < numbers.Length; ++i)\n            {\n                Swap(numbers, numberIndex, i);\n                g_program.Push(numbers[numberIndex]);\n                result += FindSolutions(numbers, numberIndex + 1, stackDepth + 1);\n                g_program.Pop();\n                Swap(numbers, numberIndex, i);\n            }\n            // Try without the number\n            result += FindSolutions(numbers, numberIndex + 1, stackDepth);\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIf you know that g_program is writing the RPN program as a stack itself (so it can easily push and pop the last instruction), I think it's reasonably easy to follow.",1319726240

I have seen lots of trolls and falemwars on the internet but I could not quit programming for thousands of trolls. This is the only thing I am good at, this is what I fell in love at 12, this is what I do to earn money to support my family...

Which is cool, for instance you might want to get web dev jobs but not PHP related, so you could just setup an search like ""web dev -php"".<p>In a nutshell: I would love to know your guys opinion, advices, what we could do to improve it, and things we are doing wrong or not all.<p>Thanks<p>BTW: We are giving away free job posts, if you want to try it out free of charge try 'GWFREE' on discount code.",1319724193

Totally agreed on the features part which matters most for the updates second to security.<p>The only open issue with Android is security updates. Manufacturers often release minor patch level updates (HTC did recently for their logger fiasco for e.g., My Atrix went 2 minor updates before getting Gingerbread etc.) but that still leaves the phones vulnerable to browser based attacks at least.<p>With Google making Browser and many other system apps uninstallable/replaceable in ICS may be they can update it like every other app - through market.<p>With Android 5.0 Google should focus on near complete modularization - all user space apps / libs can be updated by Google independently of the phone just like GMail. This may not be 100% possible but they should do as much as they can practically.",1319724114

Maybe add some Windows phone.<p>The problem as I see it is that since Android is Open Source, the manufacturers don't abstract their innovations into a HAL. For example, Motorola's FM radio and HDMI support is peppered all over inside the core eclair framework. So, someone has to mix it all together again with each new release. Usually in the FOSS space, we like to believe that the effort of maintaining private forks encourages companies to contribute their efforts back to the open source project. That doesn't work here, because manufacturers like Motorola also have the viable option to simply abandon their forks. Which is even less effort.<p>Apple has a huge economy of scale--only four or five devices (most very similar) with relatively humongous market share per device. The personnel/device ratio obviously supports a much better customer experience than any Android device can offer (with the exception of perhaps the Android developer phones).<p>I can only assume Microsoft knows what they are doing and enforces abstractions and barriers that limit the scope of manufacture monkeying.",1319724110

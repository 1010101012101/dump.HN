Apple appears to be in a gradual transition process from MacOS computers to iOS ""Don't worry, just watch the pretty pictures, and we'll tell you which PAY button to press"" devices. Windows, not wanting to be left behind selling computers instead of devices (Yuck! Computers! That's SO 20th century), is making the same transition to Metro.<p>It appears that both of the major computer platform makers have come to the same conclusion: they don't want to make computers that their customers can program for their own purposes; they want to make ever-more-tightly-sealed point-of-sale devices for buying digital products and services from the device maker and its partners.<p>In other words, if you think the sealed iPhone, tethered to giant companies with strict rules about what you may and may not do with it or put on it and its design esthetic of ""enjoy the beauty, stop resisting, do exactly as we say, and why not buy something with it, you'll feel better"" is your idea of a great ""pocket computer"" for hackers, then you should be happy about where our computers are going. Otherwise....<p>I think we hackers are going to be driven to Linux on the desktop over time, which I would have no objection to if only there were an ""Apple for Linux"" company making the hardware and matching drivers of Apple-level quality. I can live without MacOS, but the hardware is a big deal.",1339444416

4096562,comment,4095814,4095894,18,0,fjorder,,,"I've spent a reasonable amount of time using Windows, Linux, and OSX.  All of them suck.  All of them are also awesome, at different things.<p>If you want an living room PC for entertainment, Windows is king.  Neither Linux or OSX support Bluray properly and Windows still has a huge edge in gaming.  Windows also supports the most hardware.  That's become unimportant to most people, but if you work in a research lab with various oddball computer controlled devices around, you are often forced to work with Windows simply because that's the only OS supported by drivers for a lot of things.<p>OSX is the perfect OS for your mother.  There's the one ""Apple way"" of doing things, so if she needs help it's easy to give her some.  OSX gets decent battery life (on mac hardware) and still has a few Unix friendly features that haven't been locked away by Apple yet.  If you're looking for a ghetto linux workstation, OSX will do in a pinch.  I actually spent the better part of last year working under OSX on a Mac Book air.  I've used Mac's off and on for decades and this is just the most recent stint (The MBA hardware lured me in this time).  It worked, but the OS still puts up too much fight you when you try to customize it.  OSX has also gotten rather buggy.  I'm relieved to have retired it.  As I said, while it would be great for my mother I personally detest OSX.  Also, Mac hardware is moving away from the DIY crowd.  e.g. The MBA's actually use proprietary screws to keep you out of your own laptop's innards.  If you've ever saved a laptop from a coffee spill by disconnecting the battery and opening it up and doing a little cleaning, just bear in mind you won't be able to do that with most future macs.<p>Linux is bug central.  Don't get me wrong, it's come a long way from the days when Slackware was king.  You can install Ubuntu and almost everything will just work.  The devil is in the details though, and if you have a low tolerance for flakiness you'll have to tweak away.  However, no other OS is as powerful and flexible.  If you want it to do X, it can do X in dozens of different ways.  If the journey is as important as the destination for you, Linux is your OS.<p>Windows is all things to all people, but entertainment first and foremost.  OSX is for your mother or people who would rather not use a real computer.  Linux is for those who embrace the quest.  Decide (and be honest with yourself) what kind of user you are and your OS preference will become clear, although what you are forced to use may be different.  I currently use both Windows and Linux extensively, and occasionally help my Mom with OSX.",1339444411

If people are talking about your company (and plenty has been said about this) and it's something that they've heard before many times I think the publicity is not bad and if anything could get some retail investors interested.

The sudden 'house wealth' bubble was directly attributed to extremely bad fiscal policy pretty much throughout the ranks. And while a number of us in Silicon Valley have already learned the lesson 'your not really rich if your wealth is all in a bubble asset' the rest of the country got to learn this too.

My father's policy (coming from HR) was that if someone asked him for a reference, all he would give was 'Yes that person worked here, yes that was his title'. That's it. Nobody will give a negative reference because if the other company decides not to hire, the employee might sue you for submarining their chances at getting employed elsewhere.<p>So if you are relying on what the current supervisor thinks of the candidate to screen, you are in for trouble anyway.

On my iPad I write, I organise my day, I handle notes and document recipes for things I cook. I deliberately try to keep it a personal rather than business device but I still use it for work email, calendaring and a few bits and pieces (mostly notes). I read incessantly on the iPad and it's my primary source of daily news.<p>> Once Windows 8 tablets are released and become commonplace, the iPad will stand no chance.<p>You're betting on an unestablished fractured software experience against the main market leader? I can understand Windows 8 standing a chance against Blackberry, against WebOS and maybe against pre-ICS Android but it will take a long time for Windows 8 to catch up with Android <i>if</i> it blows Android out of the water. Once it's managed to get that far there has to be something seriously wrong with iOS for it to overtake. Also if you're planning on betting on Office to see you through, hate to be the one to burst your bubble but Office has been available for the iPad for months, and the iPad's had office-compatible document readers/writers that are good enough for simple documents for years.<p>> The iTV simply will not sell<p>You are right, but this is because the iTV does not exist for sale. Apple haven't announced it. There is no iTV product.<p>> Have you been living under a rock?<p>There really is no need for this type of thing on HN.<p>> Windows 8 is coming out this October. Several consumer previews have already been released, and hardware has been demoed. Windows 8 tablets are much more of a real entity than you seem to think.<p>Can I buy a Windows 8 table now? No. Can I evaluate a consumer preview version of Windows 8 on an iPad? Yes. So in a way you're right, but given that the only real entities are the wrong devices running a prototype it's not fair to compare. However, having used the consumer preview in Parallels I have to say I'm not looking forward to metro on the desktop, but on the tablet it might work well.",1339444080

4096522,comment,4094724,4094724,13,0,tokenadult,,,"From the submitted article: ""The first step in opening up a position for hiring is to define the position you are looking for. Most companies call this a job specification (or spec).""<p>But then the article, which after all is titled, ""Best Hiring Practices,"" doesn't go into detail about how to use that information to build a good hiring procedure to screen in the best applicants for each job. There are many discussions here on HN about company hiring procedures. From participants in earlier discussions I have learned about many useful references on the subject, which I have gathered here in a FAQ file. The review article by Frank L. Schmidt and John E. Hunter, ""The Validity and Utility of Selection Models in Personnel Psychology: Practical and Theoretical Implications of 85 Years of Research Findings,"" Psychological Bulletin, Vol. 124, No. 2, 262-274<p><a href=""http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%20Validity%20and%20Utility%20Psychological%20Bulletin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%...</a><p>sums up, current to 1998, a meta-analysis of much of the HUGE peer-reviewed professional literature on the industrial and organizational psychology devoted to business hiring procedures. There are many kinds of hiring criteria, such as in-person interviews, telephone interviews, resume reviews for job experience, checks for academic credentials, and so on. There is much published study research on how job applicants perform after they are hired in a wide variety of occupations.<p>The overall summary of the industrial psychology research in reliable secondary sources is that two kinds of job screening procedures work reasonably well (but only about at the 0.5 level, standing alone). One is a general mental ability (GMA) test (an IQ-like test, such as the Wonderlic personnel screening test). Another is a work-sample test, where the applicant does an actual task or group of tasks like what the applicant will do on the job if hired. Each of these kinds of tests has about the same validity in screening applicants for jobs, with the general cognitive ability test better predicting success for applicants who will be trained into a new job. Neither is perfect (both miss some good performers on the job, and select some bad performers on the job), but both are better than any other single-factor hiring procedure that has been tested in rigorous research, across a wide variety of occupations. So if you are hiring for your company, it's a good idea to think about how to build a work-sample test into all of your hiring processes.<p>For legal reasons in the United States (the same legal reason does not apply in other countries), it is difficult to give job applicants general mental ability tests as a straight-up IQ test (as was commonplace in my parents' generation) as a routine part of hiring procedures. The Griggs v. Duke Power, 401 U.S. 424 (1971) case in the United States Supreme Court<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196978&q=Griggs+Duke+Power&hl=en&as_sdt=2,24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196...</a><p>held that general intelligence tests used in hiring that could have a ""disparate impact"" on applicants of some protected classes must ""bear a demonstrable relationship to successful performance of the jobs for which it was used."" In other words, a company that wants to use a test like the Wonderlic, or like the SAT, or like the current WAIS or Stanford-Binet IQ tests, in a hiring procedure had best conduct a specific validation study of the test related to performance on the job in question. Some companies do the validation study, and use IQ-like tests in hiring. Other companies use IQ-like tests in hiring and hope that no one sues (which is not what I would advise any company). Note that a brain-teaser-type test used in a hiring procedure could be challenged as illegal if it can be shown to have disparate impact on some job applicants. A company defending a brain-teaser test for hiring would have to defend it by showing it is supported by a validation study demonstrating that the test is related to successful performance on the job. Such validation studies can be quite expensive. (Companies outside the United States are regulated by different laws. One other big difference between the United States and other countries is the relative ease with which workers may be fired in the United States, allowing companies to correct hiring mistakes by terminating the employment of the workers they hired mistakenly. The more legal protections a worker has from being fired, the more careful companies have to be about hiring in the first place.)<p>The social background to the legal environment in the United States is explained in many books about hiring procedures<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6TEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA271&dq=Validity+and+Utility+of+Selection+Models+in+Personnel+Psychology&ots=iCXkgXrlOV&sig=ctblj9SW2Dth7TceaFSNIdVMoEw#v=onepage&q=Validity%20and%20Utility%20of%20Selection%20Models%20in%20Personnel%20Psychology&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6...</a><p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6TEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA95&dq=Validity+and+Utility+of+Selection+Models+in+Personnel+Psychology&ots=iCXkgXrnMW&sig=LKLi-deKtnP20VYZo9x0jfvqzLI#v=onepage&q=Validity%20and%20Utility%20of%20Selection%20Models%20in%20Personnel%20Psychology&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6...</a><p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=frfUB3GWlMYC&oi=fnd&pg=PA9&dq=Validity+and+Utility+of+Selection+Models+in+Personnel+Psychology+%22predictive+validity%22+Duke+Power&ots=5O9Hx_E1vY&sig=g-zERWztBWq3h4guEuv9VVkTh8I#v=onepage&q=Validity%20and%20Utility%20of%20Selection%20Models%20in%20Personnel%20Psychology%20%22predictive%20validity%22%20Duke%20Power&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=frfUB3GWl...</a><p>Previous discussion on HN pointed out that the Schmidt & Hunter (1998) article showed that multi-factor procedures work better than single-factor procedures, a summary of that article we can find in the current professional literature, in ""Reasons for being selective when choosing personnel selection procedures"" (2010) by Cornelius J. Knig, Ute-Christine Klehe, Matthias Berchtold, and Martin Kleinmann:<p>""Choosing personnel selection procedures could be so simple: Grab your copy of Schmidt and Hunter (1998) and read their Table 1 (again). This should remind you to use a general mental ability (GMA) test in combination with an integrity test, a structured interview, a work sample test, and/or a conscientiousness measure.""<p><a href=""http://geb.uni-giessen.de/geb/volltexte/2012/8532/pdf/preprint_j.1468_2389.2010.00485.x.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geb.uni-giessen.de/geb/volltexte/2012/8532/pdf/prepri...</a><p>But the 2010 article notes, looking at actual practice of companies around the world, ""However, this idea does not seem to capture what is actually happening in organizations, as practitioners worldwide often use procedures with low predictive validity and regularly ignore procedures that are more valid (e.g., Di Milia, 2004; Lievens & De Paepe, 2004; Ryan, McFarland, Baron, & Page, 1999; Scholarios & Lockyer, 1999; Schuler, Hell, Trapmann, Schaar, & Boramir, 2007; Taylor, Keelty, & McDonnell, 2002). For example, the highly valid work sample tests are hardly used in the US, and the potentially rather useless procedure of graphology (Dean, 1992; Neter & Ben-Shakhar, 1989) is applied somewhere between occasionally and often in France (Ryan et al., 1999). In Germany, the use of GMA tests is reported to be low and to be decreasing (i.e., only 30% of the companies surveyed by Schuler et al., 2007, now use them).""",1339444043

All of the features announced in ios 6 (and ios 5) are catching up with features available to android 2.3 users. Pointing out that ICS only runs on 7% of devices while ios 5 runs on 80% is fun marketing games. But technically, that's like comparing apples to robots.<p>Google has updated their apps slowly over time, as they're being developed, for devices with old OS version. While apple waits for these big announcements for the big marketing show. So android users will always be getting the fresh new features before ios users. Some of those android users with newer features will be running android 2.3. Why are we even bringing up the OS version when comparing features available to older OS versions?<p>(For example, you don't need to upgrade to android 4.0 to upgrade the Google Play Store app to the latest version.

Turning on Airplane mode at night was a bad substitute for this much-needed feature<p>- Siri enhancements are nice, but would have loved to see API integration.  I understand why they aren't doing this (yet), though.  iOS would need, at the very least, some kind of Andriod-like ""intents"" system to make it work.  Even better would be a standardized way to ""teach"" Siri about things (think RDF).  This seems like one of those things they won't release until they really make sure it's done correctly, as otherwise the disparity between how Siri works natively and what it understands via API integration would be laughable.<p>- Also with respect to Siri, I'd like to see Apple improve the voice synthesis.  Don't get me wrong, it's pretty good, but it also isn't state of the art.  The voice could be made smoother and better able to communicate Siri's ""mood"" (if and when Siri is synthesized to have one).  Even without a ""mood"", her voice could stand to be less monotone.  I would also like to be able to purchase different voices.<p>- Guided Access (specifically the ""one app mode"") is going to be huge for enterprise as well as education.  I've been on more than a few iPhone ""enterprise feasibility"" projects where the fatal bullet was lack of the company's ability to lock out the home screen<p>- Facebook integration is nice (and predictable).  I really look forward to the contacts and calendar integration more than anything<p>- I thought they might announce third party apps for Apple TV, but I bet they're going to wait until the new TV product announcement for that<p>And if anyone at Apple is reading, here's my obligatory wish-list:<p>- Siri API integration and expandability (duh)<p>- A ""guest code"" if you have a password lock.  I shouldn't be worried about prying eyes if someone borrows my phone.  I should just tell them to enter ""1234"" on the lock screen and it should open up to some kind of ""guest account"" with none of my personal data, push notifications, browser history, emails, etc.<p>- Better support for external displays in the iTunes and Maps apps.  If I am driving, I'd like my car's display to show me the artist and song information at minimum.  I won't switch to Map's turn by turn unless it integrates with my external display.  If it does, I'd like it to overlay new artist and song information briefly when I change tracks",1339443910

(2) On the axis where RMS appears to stand, I do not believe his position to be the most extreme one possible. (3) Just the way most people fail to understand that politics is multidimensional, without broad knowledge, they will often mistake one political axis for another. I believe people misunderstand RMS and project their own ideals about freedom and ascetic saints/prophets onto him. I do not believe RMS to be a champion of freedom that many people who had heard of him do. There exists an equally idealistic view, from where his positions are not wrong because they are fanatical, they are wrong period.<p>Take what RMS wrote about the early days of Symbolics. When you read him, you begin to realize that he believed the community of hackers that developed at MIT to be a goal unto itself, not as a means to achieve something specific. This is in spite of the fact that every individual who started hacking at MIT (this ironically includes RMS) surely saw himself as pursuing a specific goal. It is hard to reason with a man who believes that groups of people exist in and of themselves, independently of individuals and their goals. The only possible consequence that can stem from such a position is to define freedom as a property of groups, not of individuals, which is completely alien to the notion of freedom as most people (at least in the U.S.) understand it. The exact same position, when held by people in other countries, has lead to tyrannies being established, both of right- and left-wing kind.<p>The issue that ESR is raising is a very practical one -- RMS has become the de facto spokesperson for the free software movement, which hurts free software more than it helps it.",1339443618

Apple products are successful precisely because they appeal to people in the real world.  Your comment about the iPad being a toy is a timeless refrain that has been leveled against every single Apple product since the original Macintosh.  That time, they lost to Microsoft because A) the Mac was way too expensive, B) the ecosystem was too small, and only by the standardization of the PC was a viable ecosystem able to emerge and C) Adoption was driven by businesses who purchase by checklists rather than by personal appeal.  These same downsides no longer exist, and the iPad launch is one of the most successful new products in the history of the world.<p>Probably most on HN are hoping for MS to hit a home run with Windows 8 if for no other reason than to foster competition and innovation.  But the other thing you have to realize is that Microsoft's ""no compromises"" approach is insanely difficult to pull off.

The speed at which Google can release Android and the speed at which manufactorer's can implement/upgrade Android are two very, very different things. And unlike Android, Apple does not have this release/implement gap.<p>Because less than 8% of Android users use 4.0 and Google is already about to unveil 5.0, we have to compare differently.<p>Google may have released these features into the wild faster than Apple, but when iOS6 launches this summer and then passes the Android 4.0 install base in what, 2 weeks, there will then be more Apple users using these features than Android users.<p>I think that will be the future going forward: Apple will take longer to release a feature, but will reach critical mass for the feature much, much faster than Google.<p>And like Windows and it's hardware partners, I think that there is jack-diddly-squat that Google can do about it. They can whine but they have no say, as their in-house devices sell like crap compared to Samsung's flagships or Apple's phones.<p>I think hardware will move similarly: Android manufacturer, eager for ANY advantage, will implement brand new technology on their product lines. They can also pull this off because they don't push iPhone-like quantities (minus the rare Samsung flagship launch).

It's a little more serious than the usual election year nonsense.<p>My concern is that I do not believe the country received any benefit at all from the release, and the harm could go for quite some while.

Yes, we are planning on releasing two version later. Version 1 would have jQuery stripped except for the parts that we need which would be a lot smaller (I think we mainly use the measurement and positioning routines). Version 2 would be for if you already have jQuery in which case it would use your version of jQuery. We would, of course, have to run unit testing to make sure it worked on past versions of jQuery.<p>2. Actually, all of the features are already implemented this way, even fairly basic features like bold/italic and the Shutter focus. We will be creating an online Editor builder that will let you choose what you want and it will build you an optimized version that includes only those features. You won't have to do any of the work to create it. We will probably enable you to save multiple configurations under your account as well. It will also create sprites for you so that you get only one image and it will only contain the images that you need.<p>We already have an API that abstracts the differences between each browser but we want to make sure it is stable before releasing it.<p>TheSunny",1339441545

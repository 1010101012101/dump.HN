9182286,comment,9178523,9178523,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"This article directly contradicts my understanding of some key points. For example, does the production of corn ethanol really increase food prices? I was under the impression that the US overproduces so much corn that the farmers were specifically getting tax credits to produce less of it.<p>Also, is growing and harvesting this corn (taking out the final burning of ethanol out of it for a moment) a net positive or negative in terms of carbon emissions? Is the fact that the corn is growing and absorbing carbon dioxide enough to offset the planting, fertilization, and harvesting? What about all that + conversion to ethanol + disposal of the conversion byproducts?<p>The real question is this: what is greater?<p>(a) CO2 emissions from planting, harvesting, transporting, converting, disposing of corn + CO2 emissions from burning the ethanol + CO2 and other emissions from having to recycle/downcycle/dispose of engines that die earlier because ethanol is bad for them.<p>or (b) CO2 emissions from drilling/fracking for oil, transport, refining, disposal of byproducts + CO2 emissions from burning gasoline.<p>If I accounted for all the factors, the questions of whether a > b or b > a should determine the policy.<p>There is of course a (c) CO2 emissions from mining and transporting coal/oil/natural gas to the power plant * loss factor for transporting the electricity + losses in charging systems + CO2 and other emissions from mining and processing lithium and manufacturing, transport, and recycling of lithium ion batteries.",1426042445

We avoid this completely by doing production migrations and re-indexes on every new field we add. Its expensive, and we have to write/test/run scripts in production. At times I wish I could just write a Rails migration on an RDS instance and call it a day. N-1 compatibility isn&#x27;t hard to accomplish with good code reviews.<p>2) Search. Want to search and join like in the old days? Good luck. Using a NoSQL DB as the primary authoritative store of record is great, but you&#x27;ll need a secondary indexes for any searches you want to do. If you need to look up an object on a new field (or even one that already exists in all of your data) if you haven&#x27;t built an index for it you will have to.<p>3) Serving Clients. Because of the schemaless-blobby nature of writing clients, things get real messy the minute you have multiple services or applications reading or writing to a DB. To get around this, you have to put a service in front of it and serve the data from some RPC technology, which is an extra step and requires more development and maintenance.<p>4) Administration. There aren&#x27;t a long history yet of robust toolsets and &quot;science&quot; behind different schemaless NoSQL databases. Meaning which one you choose has a huge impact on your ability to fine tune it, debug consistency or other expectation issues, and do things like proper failover, backups, restores, etc. Knowledge between similar NoSQL DBs doesn&#x27;t transfer as well so your mileage will vary more so than on SQL databases (MySQL vs PostgresSQL, for instance).<p>NoSQL has its place and purpose, but it is rarely as the &quot;one database that rules them all&quot; that many businesses end up with.

9182114,comment,9168035,9168035,0,0,MichaelMoser123,,,"> Where are Xerox Park and Bell Labs today?<p>Bell labs was financed because AT&T had a monopoly status on landlines; whatever the costs, AT&T could just raise fees for a cent and cover all expenses. AT&T lost its monopoly so it could no longer pay for Bell labs.<p>so this monopoly status was good for Bell Labs, but it also covered up the many gross inefficiencies of a monopoly body and it did limit competition - and growth.<p>> I believe the green economy merits much more funding than it is currently receiving by government<p>I suspect that this is a value based judgment.<p>Who is to know if the next growth period will rather be based on nano technology, or maybe will be based of artificial intelligence? I guess that civil servants are in a bad position to make such judgments, because they bear little personal responsibility for their decisions.<p>If one looks at the internet boom, then one can discern many stages here:<p>- first was the fundamental research that explored the subject of packet switching networks; this was funded by the US military\n- next was the gradual development of networking technology, which took some ten-fifteen years.\n  Here there were many actors, part of them from research and part from industry\n- next came the first boom-bust cycle of the nineteens; whatever one thinks of it, it helped to build the required networking infrastructure for wider adoption and it helped to create many technologies that were important for the next stage.\n- next came the present growth based on targeted advertising / private sector surveillance based on social networks.<p>No one actor could have directed this process; public sector did facilitate basic research, it created the prerequisites for growth, but actual growth was still several steps away from that; at any of these stages it could have been stopped by some misguided policy decision.<p>Prof. Mazzucato seems to underestimate the risks that entrepreneurs had to take during this process;\nResearch financed by the public sector is a prerequisite for growth, but state dirigims would not have led to it either;<p>Dirigism in France created the minitel network, but that is not quite the internet of today.",1426039687
9182113,comment,9179660,9181387,0,0,kazinator,,,"60% of maximum volume is a poor metric due to a complete ignorance of decibels, power and how the two are related together.<p>If 60% means 0.6 times some maximum number of decibels, then this is not scale invariant.  For instance 60 dB versus a maximum of 100 dB (&quot;60%&quot;) is not the same power ratio as 30 dB versus 50 dB (also &quot;60%&quot;). In the dB scale, we subtract to show ratios; we don&#x27;t indicate ratios between decibels. For instance, 10% of the maximum volume (in terms of power) means 10 dB below.<p>If 60% just means 60% of the volume position between 0 and MAX, that is also hokey because it depends on the actual taper curve. Analog volume pots use various ad-hoc &quot;audio taper&quot; curves. Digital volumes tend to be better: the steps based on dB increments. The increments are not always the same across the volume control range.<p>The maximum volume varies between amplifiers and headphones. What does that even mean? Maximum level at what percentage THD? Many sound systems can go a notch louder, if you accept greater distortion, and some people listen to rock that way.<p>A sensible starting guideline might be, say, &quot;at least 20 dB below the maximum output intensity which &#x27;typical&#x27; headphones can reproduce without distortion&quot;.  That is still hokey in a number of ways, an important one of which is that the user usually has no interface for dialing in a 20 dB drop; such markings are only found on the controls of some pro audio gear.",1426039669

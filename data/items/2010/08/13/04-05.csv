Talking to random people online eventually devolves into porn. You can't help it. Chatroulette got around that stigma by eliminating all approach anxiety to a conversation (Parker's words)--sort of like the exact opposite effect of perusing profiles of people on a dating site and messaging someone very attractive (who probably gets inundated with requests).<p>I think the notion of turning chatroulette into a performance platform is very interesting. Some of the Ben Folds chatroulette performances were pretty fascinating and managed to get at the one-to-many-ness necessary to drive large amounts of traffic on a consumer site (you don't need that to make an interesting product--but Skype seems to have nailed 1 to 1 video pretty well).

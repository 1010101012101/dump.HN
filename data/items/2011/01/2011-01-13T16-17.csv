There are two parts to it: a Firefox toolbar where you can save or ignore sites (along with their contact information); and a web front-end to the data.<p>The site supports multiple users, so if you outsource website marketing you can set your guys loose and they won't be able to duplicate the sites they've found. Currently, any users you add can only use the toolbar - they have no access to the admin area.<p>When I have some more time, I want to add the ability to change the status of sites, as well as let you add different types of user accounts, and add in some useful statistics as well.<p>I'd love to know what you think about the functionality of the site, whether it's obvious what it does, and if you give it a try how everything works for you :)<p>Thanks,

I just like the fact that I can put up videos I shot with my camera on my website without transcoding and my friends would view them just fine from their browsers and phones. I don't know which side is more open - and therefore more right - in this controversy, but in addition to openness, I support industrial collaboration. And more importantly, video codecs are used beyond just web. How about looking further and see the frustration that the non-web video people would have because of this action.",1294937956

Greek city states could have a (slave-owning) democracy, because they were small enough that politically relevant information could travel to most of the citizens fast enough for them to act on a relevant opinion. But as states became empires, the communications became stretched across wide distances, and a more autocratic system had to come into play - ordinary citizens could not get relevant information fast enough to make political choices.<p>But as we got modern postal services, the telegraph and so on, economic events on one side of a continent became pertinent to people on the other, and they would hear of them in short order. The technology made people feel invested in a nation's politics, so they could, and felt they had a right to, participate.<p>So I would have said that in today's information society, in the age of TV and Wikileaks, a 5-man dictatorship can't effectively function. Too many people feel too invested in national and world events to permit it without a Soviet-style iron control of channels of information.

I think it is hard to be sure exactly why something is popular, even when it's happening, so I suspect there isn't much evidence either way. There's two parts to the issue:<p><pre><code>    (1) did PageRank give ""better"" results, for what users wanted?
    (2) was this an active factor in their preference for google?
</code></pre>
I've heard the argument that the speed of results is a very significant factor (as the article claims), and that was definitely a factor for me. Also, I recall research from google showing the dramatic effect on user satisfaction from even slight differences in latency (above a perceived-as-instantaneous threshold).<p>Another factor at the time was that google didn't have paid ranking, so search results were better in this sense - related to this is a psychological trust issue, which would make people feel more comfortable with google, even if the improvement in search results was insignificant. You didn't have suspect the results.<p>Possibly the crucial factor (at that time) was that everyone else had crowded homepages; whereas google was simple and sparse and just did search.<p>Both the last two have been eroded, as the competition copied google. One would think they could also catch up on latency - it's certainly easier for any search engine that processes fewer queries. Google retains the advantage of familiarity, which surprisingly is one of the strongest competitive advantages for <i>consumer</i> goods, where the technology doesn't change much (eg. gum and cola).<p>So... provided google keeps up with the competition technically, it will trounce them commercially.",1294935711

This is a mostly idiotic article.<p>First of all, for an Infrastructure Architect the guy has his storage knowledge all backwards: “<i>With YouTube, we’re talking about exabytes upon exabytes of storage. Maybe even petabytes.</i>”<p>1 Exabyte = 1,024 Petabytes = 1,048,576 Terabytes<p>I’m sure that it was an innocent mixup, but good grief does it come across as someone who’s trying to appear important and knowledgeable simply by tossing in some obscure computer terms.<p>Second, as others have pointed out as well, the whole logic of his argument doesn’t make sense. Youtube, with all its massiveness, is probably <i>never</i> going to be able to drop H.264 simply because it would no longer be able to stream its videos to any of the Android [1], iOS, webOS and Blackberry devices out there today. That’s hundreds of millions of devices that would suddenly not be able to play Youtube videos anymore if Youtube goes WebM <i>only</i>.<p>( [1] side note: Only Android devices running 2.3 and higher are capable of WebM, but 1: that's with a battery-draining software renderer and 2: as we know, Android fragmentation is a pretty serious thing and millions of people are still running pre-2.3 OSes and there's no way that all of them will be upgraded at some point.)<p>Quoth the fool Jason Perlow: <i>My guess is that in addition to Android licensees, Apple and other device manufacturers which use embedded browsers such as RIM are not going to deny their customers and end-users embedded YouTube video support if Google chooses to encode to to a VP8/Theora standard, and I would expect the same of Microsoft and Internet Explorer and its embedded variations as well. Mozilla and Firefox we already know is completely on-board.</i><p>Yes, I'm sure Apple, RIM, Microsoft and HP/Palm can somehow <i>magically</i> upgrade all the devices they have already sold to millions of customers and add WebM support to them. It’s not like if you're the owner of an iPhone 3G you can't install the very latest version of iOS on your device. Oh, wait. You can't.<p>Simply put, the chance of Youtube dropping H.264 entirely and only maintaining their videos in WebM container format using VP8 is about 0.01%. It's higher if you look WAY far into the future, when <i>absolutely no one</i> uses ANY of the 300+ million mobile computing devices we're using today anymore. But that's a whole lot of years into the future, and also depends entirely on Microsoft and Apple adding WebM support to their devices when they don't yet have much incentive to do so. Or at least, it won't be because of Youtube.<p>There should be no doubt that Google wants there to be only one format for video on the Web, 20–30 years from now, and that they prefer it to be WebM instead of H.264 if only so that they (and you, using their infrastructure) can sell video whenever and wherever they (and you) want without having to pay MPEG LA for it. Storage and technical specifics of the video format are secondary concerns which are actually great arguments <i>against</i> this logic, for the situation in the ""short"" term that is the coming 5 to 10 years.<p>So all in all, sure, Youtube is an obvious motivator for this kind of move, but the article has the entire thing backwards in explaining it.",1294935486

2100209,comment,2099816,2099816,0,0,jasonlotito,,,"A story of my last use of Standard Deviation.<p>My day to day job deals with credit card processing.  A lot of my job deals with ensuring that transactions occur securely and reliably.  It's a tedious job, it's not exciting, and involves a lot of testing, but I love the sense of knowing that actual money is flowing through a system I built.<p>Anyways, one of the things I wanted to do was build an automate alert system that would notify me of problems with processing transactions.  Looked at it from high up, the system is fairly stable, and while it would be easy to notice if transactions suddenly stopped on the entire system, this rarely, if ever, actually happens (and hasn't happened except for planned < 1 minute outages).<p>However, consider the system runs through it many small individual sites, looking at all transactions is fairly useless.  Instead, I wanted a warning to notify me when any specific account was suffering.  Each account is different, and accounts for a variable number of transactions each day.  Some accounts do more, some less.  Their are other variables: some accounts do well at different types of the day because of where they are promoted in the world.  Weekends generally see an uptick, but this again is variable.<p>So, I developed a system (using standard deviation) that essentially looked at an accounts history for the past X time period for a certain period of time throughout the day.  Some accounts are inspected by looking at the numbers in the past hour (accounts with steady transactions), others are looked at over the last few hours, others are looked at over the day.<p>Obviously, we don't alert ourselves to certain cases that fall outside standard deviation, and we've adjusted the numbers to look at other areas, but the result of using standard deviation in this way suddenly opened up a new way at looking at our numbers and evaluating the current status of our system, as well as the accounts using it.  Even if a problem doesn't exist on our end, we can alert the people that handle these accounts that a problem might exist, allowing them to take necessary action.<p>Understanding standard deviation, understanding how it can be used (along with other associated tools of math) makes for some really interesting things that you can do to improve your system as a whole.",1294934853

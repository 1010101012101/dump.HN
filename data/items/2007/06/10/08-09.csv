Perhaps they hate Microsoft and want to provide a way for people to migrate away from the MS Platform, once they see the light.<p>I have wondered the same thing about studio musicians. I was thinking that if you are such a skilled musician, why wouldn't you write your own music. But I was told that some people just don't have that creative streak, whereas others lack the skill to perform on their instruments. Could be the same with Mono - they are probably excellent programmers and enjoy programming, but don't have own ideas about what to program.<p>In my opinion, that is bullshit, though - it is not so hard to get good ideas.

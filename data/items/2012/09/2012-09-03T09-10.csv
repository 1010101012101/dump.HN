""It has been my experience that XXX""<p>The parent has made a different formulation, specifically:
""Every person belonging to group Y has had experience XXX""<p>This difference is significant, because the argument is basically stating that it is not only the experience of the person making the argument, but that the person making the argument is expecting that the readers of the argument are going to be able to confirm the experience <i>for themselves</i>.  This is a much stronger argument than mere anecdote.<p>And for those that are already starting to lean on their keyboards to type ""the plural of anecdote is not data"", that platitude is a recognition that data is supposed to repose on a generalisable sample of reality, and if you are just going on anecdote, even multiple anecdotes, you are leaving yourself wide open to claims of cherry-picking.

4469792,comment,4469010,4469390,1,0,dalke,,,"You asked why it sounded desperate. I gave you an answer. Now you're saying that you're ""REALLY desperate."" Then why did you ask the question when you already knew the answer? Ahh, but at the end you said it was ""really just an exercise to make the reader think"", so I take it it was not meant to be convincing.<p>I already addressed your point about ""very good educated guesses."" That is, the people in the 1950s said that they made ""very good educated guesses"" about the reactors then being designed, which in turn were based on ""already successful experiments."" It's the same sort of people making the predictions now - how do we know that their predictions are any more well grounded? Freeman Dyson, in ""Disturbing the Universe"", gave a reason which resonates with me. In short, you need multiple iterations to get a the technology working well, and the reactors which came online in the 1950s-1970s were too early in the evolution cycle. The exception was military reactors, which went through lots of iterations, but of course which aren't appropriate for utility power generation.<p>Which is exactly how the Moon missions worked - build plenty of rockets, watch them explode, figure out what went wrong, and do a new iteration. How many iterations of thorium power plants will we need to develop in order to make safe, efficient, economical thorium power plants? One, ten, one hundred? What practical experience justifies that estimate? So permit me to feel skeptical when I read echoes of the rose-colored promises from the Atomic Age which mention nothing about the practical matters learned the hard way.<p>You may say that all you want is ""some form of energy that does not create green house gases"" but the article barely mentions other non-greenhouse-gas systems, and mostly dismissively in the ambiguously written line ""The newest reactors produce far less waste, run far more safely and are far more reliable than solar or wind."" (It's ambiguous because it reads like 'the newest reactors run far more safely than solar or wind', when it's trying to say that they are safer than older reactors.) It also mentions nothing about improved energy conservation.<p>I never said anything about preaching to the President to lie. You (since you say you are the author) are the one who calls people liars, specifically the ""self-serving opponents of anything nuclear science.""<p>Your comments about the political system are only somewhat applicable. The US is not the only political system in the world. India has strong economic incentives to go towards thorium, and have a technological base at least equal to the 1960s US, yet they don't predict working thorium reactors for at least another few decades. BTW, your argument seems to be that everything's getting corrupted, and you just want things to go corrupt in the way you want it to be. I am morally opposed to that justification.<p>You mistake the lesson I took from TMI, Chernobyl, and Fukushima, which is that people don't like reactors because dense power sources which can't trivially be shut off are suspect. Coal is 'safe' because its direct failure modes is to catch on fire, and that's easily handled. Solar is 'safe' because its direct failure mode is to stop generating electricity. Wind is 'safe' because its failure mode is to fall down. Hydro based on large reservoirs is less safe, because the history of dam breaks shows that they have some pretty nasty failure modes. All of these 'safe' systems have have hundreds of design iterations and improvements, and real-world failures. Note that by 'safe' I am not including environmental impact. The term ""safe"" has several different meaning, and I'm limiting it to just this one.<p>This article was supposed to make me think? It made me think that the author understands neither people nor politics nor history.",1346665247

Started building a product and built a lot of links for traffic. The authority and product I built then were the fundament for everything else. Not annoying my users, and building a strong site were always very important, as opposed to doing short-term black hat stuff while forgetting about content. I continually do keyword research; always keep my eyes open.<p>5) Not just Adsense, some other ad networks as well. All display ads though.<p>6) Depends. There are many keywords, some rank #1, some page #1, some don't rank at all. Depends on the quality of the content as well, I continually work on that.<p>7) For this project, yes. I've done PPC on other projects, but it doesn't seem to be profitable so far for this one.<p>8) Depends on what you call black hat. I've never spammed anything. Have bought a link here and there in the past, but I do have a huge amount of natural links as well. I guess that for industry standards, I'm pretty clean.",1346663043

For any technology there will be a price vs. expected sales volume curve and thus a sweet spot that maximizes revenue. It's possible that people have looked at enough numbers and figured out that the interaction between the demand curves for memristors and for flash is such that they can more easily maximize revenue by delaying memristors.<p>For example, pricing memristor based drives exceedingly high will still likely put them well within the price range of ultra high-end flash based enterprise level drives (such as card based multi-terabyte SLC based drives), and so will still result in a canibalization of flash sales.",1346662886

That's an out of the air figure which makes no sense at all.<p>I used to be an EE and a reduction in manufacturing cost like that is never going to happen unless you're selling LED keyrings or something.<p>Probably a more realistic one is 80% of the cost and the profit margin has probably been destroyed by the uptake of computers in schools.<p>Also don't forget that even though they are simple devices, their SoC (z80) is binary compatible going back to 1996 (that's 16 years). It takes a lot of money to keep that compatibility and good supplier relations producing old silicon yet adding features.<p>Other manufacturers such as Casio don't open up their platform as much as TI and therefore can swap CPUs etc. If you look at Casio, each device is fundamentally different and incompatible. Some of them are SH3, some microcontroller, some dedicated silicon. Buy a Casio 9750 now and it won't run a program you wrote on a 7400 a few years ago.<p>TI decided to fix all this with the NSpire which uses Mentor Nucleus as the OS and gives people binary compatibility through other means i.e a higher bedrock abstraction.<p>The 83 is spot on for schools which is why they insist on it. It's just the right device for the job and is a sensible convention.<p>The NSpire emulates a  TI83 to give you an idea how important this is to TI ( <a href=""http://education.ti.com/images/product-family/nspire-touchpad-84-Keypad-Insertion.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://education.ti.com/images/product-family/nspire-touchpa...</a> )",1346662828

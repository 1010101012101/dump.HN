This might not be the case for you, but I do want to point out an alternate perspective that is infrequently given coverage in such threads.<p>2) Also nope! Sorry if I seem a bit amused now. Controlling implies &quot;You have to do such-and-such and be dominated by me, and I don&#x27;t have to do such-and-such and be dominated by you.&quot; My philosophy is that what I expect from my partner, I follow all the way through myself. There is no power issue, because both contribute equally to the relationship.<p>I will again point out the seeming contradiction between &quot;I don&#x27;t need to be faithful; my partner[s] do,&quot; or if you don&#x27;t like that, &quot;Men don&#x27;t need to be faithful; women do.&quot; Perhaps that&#x27;s not what you intend, but it sure sounds that way.<p>In terms of &quot;controlling,&quot; if you expect fidelity from your partners but not yourself, and if you say that expecting fidelity sounds controlling, that <i>would</i> logically imply you are controlling.<p>Incidentally, I hope you recognize nothing I&#x27;ve said should be taken as ad hominem attacks.

Bitcoin is, and has always been, a medium of exchange first and foremost.</i><p>Which is consistent with the primary function and origin of money: because there is a division of labor it means a common medium of exchange must exist. The secondary functions of money - store of value and unit of account - are precisely that...secondary. You can&#x27;t have the secondaries without the primary (see: gold). I sort of wish the OP wouldn&#x27;t have made the characteristic of money as being a medium of exchange out to be a &quot;oh well money is also this&quot;. The problem is that the press got a hold of Bitcoin for it&#x27;s secondary reasons and drove the eyeballs to that without defining the problem to begin with: our medium of exchange, globally, is broken.<p>IMHO, Bitcoin adoption curve is taking exactly the course it should be: the exchanges that are at most threatened by poor inefficiencies (&quot;third world&quot;) are seeing the most benefit. The first world doesn&#x27;t have a problem moving money because there are solutions...they just cost money. Third world doesn&#x27;t have solutions.

8065357,comment,8063870,8065143,2,0,peterhunt,,,"You get all of this for free with React.<p>DOM node reuse is perhaps the central theme of React so it&#x27;s odd that you bring this up as a criticism (see <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OeXsL5mr4g"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OeXsL5mr4g</a>)<p>Calculating the virtual DOM does come with some processing and GC overhead, yes. But any system that tracks changes for you (data binding) comes with overhead and React makes the right set of tradeoffs for real apps (since it is a function of how large your render output is, not your underlying data model). React has about a 70% edge in CPU time on Angular in the &quot;long list&quot; class of benchmarks (which drops to a mere 40% with the Object.observe() performance unicorn). And steady state memory usage is almost always better with a virtual DOM approach since again it only tracks what you actually render which is usually smaller than your data model (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3KksH8gfcQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3KksH8gfcQ</a>).<p>DOM coordination boils down to non-interleaving of reads and writes to the DOM. React manages the writes for you which happen in one go. Components have a well-defined lifecycle which is also batched and are only allowed to read from the DOM during specific points in the lifecycle, which are coordinated system-wide. So out of the box if you follow the guidelines you will thrash the DOM much less (see <a href=""http://blog.atom.io/2014/07/02/moving-atom-to-react.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.atom.io/2014/07/02/moving-atom-to-react.html</a>)",1405969031

These still create value for society in ways that our current economy measures poorly.<p>- In a basic income environment, there is no reason for a minimum wage to exist.

Exponential growth is serious stuff. Triple exponential growth is just <i>stupid fast</i>.<p>If you can&#x27;t wait 20 years, then you have to move forward with arguments for not-valid-but-sometimes-true cases. And in this case, the agent with the most compute power can generate contradictions for opposing props more quickly and can also generate true instances matching his policy preferences more quickly. Thus, bounded argumentation often inherently favors the more resource-rich adversary.<p>And the same thing works in more informal settings as well.<p>One way to cope with this is to disregard arguments from known bad actors. We can discuss rather that&#x27;s the correct course of action, but the need is a provable fact of the most useful formal systems and an observable fact of informal argumentation (I&#x27;m still not sure which you want to discuss, since your assumptions make me think you view all arguments as formal systems, but most arguments -- including this one -- clearly aren&#x27;t in any meaningful sense of the word formalized).",1405968458

Too much is made out of the fee reduction of BTC (I think because it&#x27;s easy for regular folks to understand) - but that&#x27;s only a major factor for why you&#x27;re able to develop on top of it. Bitcoin is SO much more than fees, and really the fees themselves aren&#x27;t &quot;set in stone&quot; - others will charge on top of BTC anyway, so we have no idea what the fees will be eventually. Coinbase charges 1% for interchange, which seems reasonable, and that&#x27;s just the start.<p>The card &quot;network&quot; itself wouldn&#x27;t have to have the fees it has, it&#x27;s Visa and Mastercard, the banks, and especially Amex that DECIDE to make the fees higher. Another example is ACH, which is essentially free to transact, and in some countries has wide adoption.<p>Fees should NOT be a major driver in BTC adoption for consumers or businesses. If you want low fees, let&#x27;s work on ACH (and we are). But Bitcoin has a TON of other benefits, and those are phenomenally well documented here.",1405968124

Creating the technology that makes this relatively transparent is quite doable, but you still need an active bitcoin market in both financial markets. If the general pattern of value transfer is unidirectional (e.g. remittances) then there needs to be a viable flow of bitcoin out of the destination country (i.e. your Kenyan bitcoin purchaser needs to regularly make purchases from foreign markets in bitcoin); that&#x27;s tricky to establish.<p>On top of this issue, big banks charge only cents to send large amounts of cash internationally (according to somebody I talked to a couple months ago, Citi charges 10c per international ACH transaction assuming you have $250k on deposit) so the volume in the bitcoin market has to be built from small transactions -- there&#x27;s no real upside to doing large transactions over bitcoin vs international ACH.",1405967737

I&#x27;ve felt that programs should aim at providing equal access, not equal representation. Had you spoken to me a few years ago, i would have strongly agreed that this program was a bad idea, and more likely to stigmatize than to emancipate. I would have especially heckled it for arbitrarily benefiting one class of people at the exclusion of all others.<p>However.<p>My country adopted new electoral legislation a while ago, forcing politicial parties to put the same number of women as men on the voting ballots. I thought it was a silly idea and would lead to a decrease in the quality of candidates, and in the end it wouldn&#x27;t help women get elected. Then something peculiar happened. Because all those women were on the ballots they became much more visible in the media, and because they were more visible they got elected. Because they got elected, they shook up the political establishment, and that in turn infused politics with fresh ideas, cementing the women&#x27;s right to be there. After a while, it became so self-evident that a lot of women were on the ballot that the door was opened to other underrepresented communities, and the notion that only portly middle-aged white men could get elected flew out the window. It&#x27;s gotten to the point that if you got rid of the law mandating it, there would still be a diverse cast on the voting ballots.<p>So, to conclude by making an actual point, while you can point at this fog creek initiative and see its flaws, and i agree it is a flawed program, you should give it a fair chance and measure it by its achievements.

DOM reuse is e.g. getting an already-rendered table row, binding a new value to it, and modifying only the DOM properties in the complex DOM structure that actually did change. E.g. you modify only an Element.text deep in the first column, and a few other values in the other columns. Or maybe you need to do more, but all you do is delta. You don&#x27;t just annotate a DOM structure with a key at row level, as it is closer to a hash of the DOM, not speaking of the data-dependent event handlers.<p>Calculating the DOM (virtual or not) is expensive, compared to not calculating at all. Creating a virtual DOM structure and not using it afterward creates GC pressure, compared to not creating at all. We are talking about optimizations in the millisecond range. A large table with complex components inside will reveal the impacts of these small things.<p>DOM coordination is not just making the DOM writes in one go. Complex components like to interact with each other, depending on their position and size on their page, and the changes in the underlying structure. They read calculated style values, and act upon those values, sometimes causing reflows. And if such things happen at scale, forced reflows may cripple the performance, and coordinating such changes may be more crucial than the framework you are choosing.<p>I am sure that people who are familiar with React may have their way get these stuff. I have looked at it, and I haven&#x27;t seen it to happen automatically, while with Angular.dart, I get it without effort.",1405967083

But its moon programme was inadequately funded (and not funded at all until 1963 or so), not terribly focussed (there were designs based on Proton/Zond for flybys, tested unmanned shortly before Apollo 10, based on the N1, a giant kerosene rocket, on the UR-700, an ultimately undeveloped giant Proton, and so on), and subject to political interference, both from the government, and between the design bureaus.<p>It also wasn&#x27;t pursued as the ultimate goal in the same way the US one was; at the time the USSR was also working on the Almaz (later Salyut) space stations, an automated sample return system, a greater focus on interplanetary probes (albeit without much success except for the Venus stuff) and other bits and pieces.<p>If they&#x27;d been willing to take the risk, they could probably have had the first manned flyby; there were a number of Zond missions, using a modified Soyuz, unmanned, in the couple of years before Apollo 10. It would have been _extremely_ risky, though; most of the Zond missions were at least partial failures.",1405966894

The problem is that the standard is often not minimal enough, or is minimal in the wrong ways, or is too minimal to be of practical use.

I would say that currently the answer is yes. PHP hosting is ubiquitous and you would face an uphill battle if you also had to wait for shared host providers to provide another environment.<p>It&#x27;s kinda chicken/egg thing.  If customers start requesting Erlang being installed on shared hosting then providers will start offering it.  The thing is, most Wordpress customers don&#x27;t give two shits about what language their CMS is written in. I&#x27;d argue that many of them don&#x27;t even know what language it is written in.",1405966374

In fact, it could even sell off its shares in times of need to finance other municipal needs.<p>If it&#x27;s converted into a cooperative, it would become 100% member-owned, and any profits would not go to outside shareholders, as with a publicly traded company, but would instead go back to its member-owners in the form of lower costs.<p>The more I think about it, the more I think this is the way to go for other cities of a similar size.  Clearly, Comcast/Verizon weren&#x27;t very interested in laying down their own fiber there if the city beat them to it.  And once a utility company (in this case, publicly owned) has an effective monopoly in a certain area, it&#x27;s going to be hard for others to introduce competing infrastructure.  BUT, I would think that the ability to then sell the publicly owned utility would have significant value to the municipalities.",1405966294

Does anyone know if the AGC was ever used to make a mission-critical decision in the absence of the ground-based radar system?<p>Edit: I think it was actually the PGNCS that was made back-up [1].

Sex, in a manner of speaking, is the acceptance of a person by another that they are viewed as successful enough to contribute in passing on DNA.  You could say it is the pinnacle of biological success.  This is where most arguments stop with the conclusion that: Sex = Good so More Sex = Better. By doing so they are failing to see the whole picture.<p>The above conclusion works for many animals; humans are psychologically far more complex than animals.  \nHumanity has to balance many other concerns including: \n- The well being of other people (primarily their mate)\n- their desires to progress a career\n- social standing among peers\n- emotional distress caused by &#x27;loneliness&#x27;\n- the rearing of children and fulfillment of personal instinct to see them succeed\n- etc<p>All of these are areas that benefit from a monogamous relationship because the physiological and psychological needs for co-validation can be met which then frees up mental energy to focus on other things that bring more lasting value to life than the intense yet fleeting moments of an orgasm.",1405965714

I guess given that you were probably receiving feedback on that, I will take it as something to be acknowledged.<p>I can see the reference semantics point, in this context the difference from the lambdas seems to make more sense.<p>// Just to explore another avenue, again mostly out of curiosity :-), how realistic (from the impl. POV) would be to have value-semantic range-based `for` with _mandated_ copy elision whenever possible?<p>True about `std::for_each`, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve referred to as the &quot;allowance&quot; for the mutable iterators, wasn&#x27;t aware about the grouping being merely a historical artifact, though. I&#x27;ve always felt a bit dirty using it for mutation[1], it seems that maybe unnecessarily so :-)<p>// [1] -- perhaps due to the algorithm being specified in terms of the InputIterator concept; hm, that being said, I suppose that while it only guarantees that we can read (dereferenced) `it`, it doesn&#x27;t say that `it` _itself_ has to be immutable (right?), so it could be that I should think of a better metaphor to internalize.

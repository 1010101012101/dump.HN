If your are coming to US, I would recommend you try to find a remote working job at startups,and then go back. The visa situation being what it is, as others have suggested, doesn&#x27;t really leave you with that many options. Also it is arguable whether being physically present in SF would help that much to offset the cost of coming and staying there for whatever time required.",1442843952

I believe your aggressiveness is due to the competitiveness, not the &quot;violent&quot; content of the game.<p>The video games I play are generally shooters (e.g. Halo series) or sports games (e.g. FIFA). I&#x27;m not a violent or aggressive person and video games have almost never made me upset. However, I tend to play mostly offline, either by myself or couch co-op with friends.<p>This past year, I started playing FIFA (soccer) online, against others. It&#x27;s a rush because it&#x27;s competitive, but for a while (during the learning curve) I was embarrassed and shocked by how much it affected my mood. After a bad session of FIFA, I was angry, short-tempered, aggressive and it easily bled into my actual life. I recognized this negative behavior and was able to stamp it out (which shouldn&#x27;t be an accomplishment for a 30-something adult).<p>My point being, the trigger for me was not the content of the game (shooting vs. sports), but playing in an ultra-competitive environment against others, where winning comes at all costs (even unsportsmanlike tactics).<p>I imagine that if I went out to play a competitive soccer match (which I do play) and lost a tight game to an obnoxious opponent, I would also come home with higher than normal anger and aggressiveness - that is what competition can do to you, chemically.",1442843946

For a given word, you can construct an automaton that matches that word within a certain edit distance in O(n) where n is the length of the word. Since the result is a DFSA, you can also see if a string matches in O(n). (See the work of Schulz & Mihov.)<p>Moreover, rather than going over each word in a dictionary to find out whether that word is within a certain distance, you can compute the intersection language of the Levenshtein automaton and the dictionary automaton (which is generally faster, intersection is O(mn) in the number of states of the two automata).<p>For an implementation of this and more, see:<p><a href=""https://github.com/danieldk/dictomaton"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/danieldk/dictomaton</a>",1442843439

Binary star systems are a popular speculative example of &quot;starivore&quot; civilizations that consume entire stars that have been moved into the alien civilization&#x27;s own star system, and perhaps some combination of multiple stars in a single system are not &quot;naturally&quot; occurring in the absence of alien influence. To an unsuspecting observer, some forms of distant astronomical-scale engineering could be mistakenly interpreted as natural astrophysics that the observers then incorporate into their standard models when refactoring to account for all of the observed data... Usually the simple explanations are correct, but when your models require really insane updates to handle the observed data, perhaps there are other explanations? At the same time though, what recourse would we have if 99% of the visible universe was already astro-engineered?",1442843435

It is really well designed, not state-of-art like the one in iOS however it is still leaps ahead from any other encryption implementation currently in the industry. Perfomance wise, it&#x27;s great too. I have a Moto X with Android 5.1, running encryption from day one, and didn&#x27;t even notice any slowdown (and it uses soft encryption, no support for hardaware).<p>Android users seems to care more about benchmarks them security. The fact that Google removed the encryption by default was after all the bitching that people made after some releases showed that Nexus 6 was faster without encryption. However, there is no proof that this had any significant impact on performance, and I think Google put this restriction after a careful study that encryption by default, even on pure software implementation, did not impact usability on devices. OEMs do like benchmarks and likes to be lazy (&quot;no encryption by default means I don&#x27;t need to create a module implementing encryption that my hardware already supports! less money to spend, more profit!&quot;) because this makes people buy more phones, so they probably pressured Google to remove default encryption because encryption &quot;makes performance looks worse&quot; (on paper, not in real life).<p>If I was part of the midia, I would do a blind test running Nexus 6 with both encryption enabled and disabled. This would show if the performance impact was significant. But the majority of midia prefers the easier way using benchmarks, so we had all these Android users crying rivers that they lost performance. Serious, wtf.",1442843262

The optimal solution for using the electromagnetic spectrum for signaling, even with our current level of technology, is to use it in such a way that it looks like noise due to compression and due to not using any more power than necessary, in any direction other than the necessary one. <i>Of course</i> aliens do not sit there using four or five (if not six) orders of magnitude more power than necessary by broadcasting in all directions instead of using a directional beam, and <i>of course</i> they do not sit there and transmit in an uncompressed format that is an obvious signal, so <i>of course</i> we don&#x27;t see their transmissions.

A lot of physical consumer goods are in this category.<p>In between, you have markets with a high cost infrastructure but where the main goal is to be a public good. These market need constant input because their interest is not entirely aligned with the consumer. ISPs can be a good example of this, if you don&#x27;t put laws to correct the default behaviour, it will never work well.

   behavior is one of the most studied and best established.
   Of the 31 studies reviewed, 14 investigated the relation
   between violent video game use and aggressive behaviors.
   Aggressive behavior measures included experimental proxy
   paradigms, such as the administration of hot sauce or
   a noise blast to a confederate, self-report questionnaires,
   peer nomination and teacher rating of aggressiveness.
</code></pre>
If this is indeed the case, then there is cause for concern with these techniques, especially depending on the age group. [1] We further see self-reports mentioned as evidence for later factors, so as a whole I&#x27;m not sure what to think of this.<p>Moreover, the actually interesting question (does this aggressive behavior lead to real-world violence) is openly admitted to be unanswered. I&#x27;d wager that to a large extent basic measurements of &quot;aggression&quot; will be positive simply due to the player being engrossed by the game in question. The methods listed above in general are hardly that rigorous.<p>Furthermore:<p><pre><code>   The research has also not adequately included samples
   representative of the current population demographics,
   nor has it sufficiently examined the potential differences
   in effects when participant samples have been diverse;
   no conclusions about differences in effects related to
   ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or culture can be
   drawn from the currently available research.

I was told that the feature was necessary to make a $60 million sale.<p>I looked at the spec and, of course, the change they were requesting was disallowed.  Even worse, there was an actual law specifically forbidding running equipment with that ability in the country where the request was being made.  I refused to implement it.<p>The B level manager came to my lowly cubicle (I was still pretty young back then, so didn&#x27;t actually hobnob with people in that stratosphere often).  I was told that it would cause a lot of people a lot of trouble if I didn&#x27;t do the work.  And besides, <i>we</i> weren&#x27;t running the equipment, so <i>we</i> weren&#x27;t breaking the law.  I refused again.<p>They never asked me again and I never knew if they found someone else to patch the code without my knowledge. I&#x27;m pretty sure they did.  But how do you whistle-blow that?  They just cut cut everyone who doesn&#x27;t play ball out of the loop.<p>I can well imagine something like that happening here.  It&#x27;s pretty easy to find someone with kids, or someone who needs their job for keeping their work visa, or someone who just doesn&#x27;t care.  You can patch it in the load build in most large companies and nobody would ever know the difference.",1442841911

I'm sure that someone is saying this already in the comments, but don't have time to read all.<p>Find the person in the hospital that is having pain (figurative), whoever deals with the ER scheduling. Start by giving offering the hospital 15-25 %",1194291595
76353,comment,75761,76181,0,0,jimbokun,,,"I suspect that the researchers cited in the article might point out people who demonstrated aptitude like Yano's and yet did not achieve as much as someone who had less aptitude but worked harder.  There is some baseline of innate aptitude required for excellence, but among people surpassing that baseline hard work is what distinguishes them; that is the hypothesis proffered in the article.<p>As for Mozart, the point was that even he had to put in over 10 years of work before producing his best work.  But, because he started at 3 he got there at a really early age.",1194291544
76352,comment,75941,75941,0,0,JustPassing,,,"Erdos2 makes some good, interesting, points but I wonder how often that section on a grant form asking if the research results will be transferred to a corporation is used?  How easy would it be to get this through peer review?  I suspect that under current funding conditions, very difficult unless the company was supplying serious cash and unique expertise.  If I was sat on a review panel and saw a proposal saying that ""This work will be great but we will not publish it and everything will belong to company X"", my response would be ""Why isn't X paying for everything then?"".  Actually my response would be quicker and firmer, but you get the drift.

I nearly told Vinod this one day before his partner told me that it was designed by Vinod's daughter. <p>Truth is KV has invested in many new web companies including big guys like Slide and RingCentral.  Maybe they just don't want a ton of inbound slide decks from web 2.0 companies making sticky note apps.",1194289653
76345,comment,76209,76209,0,0,yubrew,,,"This is really interesting stuff.  But I wonder, how much did this guy do?  The 'machine' they talk about emits radiofrequency waves of a certin wavelength and strength, something that can be bought from a catalogue.  Did he make the nanoparticles?  Probably not, you can buy these nanoparticles from stores found via a simple online search.  Did he find the radio frequency himself, or did he look up other studies that have been doing this since 2002, and just copy their procedures?  Maybe I'm wrong, but I do not see anything novel from this article.  <p>There is a lot of promise from respected academic institutions for using gold nanorods and nanoparticles for cancer therapeutics.  On the other hand, few treatments ever get through clinical trials and are approved for use in mass populations.  <p>For those interested, other universities that have been doing similar things include UCSF, Georgia Tech, and Purdue University.",1194289425

4581593,comment,4579784,4579784,1,0,fjorder,,,"For a classical analogy, compare an asynchronous analogue circuit designed to evaluate a specific equation to a clocked digital circuit that evaluates that same equation.  The analogue circuit will orders of magnitude simpler, but it will be extremely difficult to incorporate it into a much larger circuit because fluctuations in heat, etc. will change when output is produced as well as potentially changing the result.  Clocked digital gates allow for more deterministic output to arrive at a known time, thus allowing far greater complexity.<p>Currently, quantum computing is just barely at the simple analogue circuit level (e.g. D-Wave).  Fault tolerance is crucial for scaling up quantum computing devices towards more complex algorithms and, eventually, being able to execute stored programs.  Fault tolerant protocols typically operate by redundantly encoding a single qubit's worth of data in several physical qubits.  How many physical qubits are required depends greatly on the reliability of the physical qubits used.  Thus, the complexity of a quantum computer is massively dependent on finding reliable physical qubits, like majorana fermions could prove to be!",1348765126

Instead, it is doing the same amount of training as you would do if you were doing one of the three sports exclusively. But in the same amount of training, you are training to perform three sports rather than one.<p>This necessarily means that a triathlete is not performing to his/her ability in any single sport. For example, a good time for the marathon portion of an Ironman is 2:40-2:50, but a competitive marathon time is 2:05 or faster. Just to add additional perspective, a good marathon time for an amateur runner is 2:30, faster than what a topnotch triathlete would be expected to pull off.",1348765084

4581583,comment,4580314,4581478,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"At a NASA talk on space debris (part of the Space Technology Grand Challenge program at NASA [1]) the presenter mentioned that so called 'structured orbit' systems (like Iridium and GPS) were particularly vulnerable because their service depended on where they were in orbit and they had finite maneuvering capability. So GPS destruction is a combination of satellites which run out of gas swerving and jinking to avoid junk, and losing individual satellites due to forced (de-orbit) or worse actual destruction.<p>It was by that reasoning that this presenter was describing the space junk disaster as a sort of slow motion thing but the first indicator that you and I would notice would be that GPS service goes away. Its also exponential in that actual collisions threaten on 1 or 2 additional satellites but dozens in orbits above and below.<p>Then he finished with current NASA timelines (about 25 years before a system might be tested) and funding (0).<p>Granted he may have just been trying to rustle up funding for his pet project but I found his reasoning pretty compelling.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/503466main_space_tech_grand_challenges_12_02_10.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/503466main_space_tech_grand_challeng...</a>",1348765014

BrowserID works somewhat differently. Your ID is an email address, so your provider is that email's domain. Because few domains support it directly yet, Mozilla operates an optional, centralized authority that can issue credentials to other users. But you don't have to use that if you add support on your own domain.<p>After that, the UI is also provided by Mozilla's cross-browser JS shim, but it's just a polyfill for `navigator.id.<i>`. If your browser has native support for those methods (Firefox will, soon), then Mozilla's UI is completely uninvolved.<p>Basically, we're starting with a single, optional point of centralization: login.persona.org. As native support comes online from various domains and browsers, our central fallback will automatically drop out of the picture.<p>> </i>Am I correct in presuming Persona is an implementation of BrowserID?*<p>Yep! BrowserID is the protocol, Persona is Mozilla's cross-browser UI and optional centralized services.

4581545,comment,4579623,4579982,5,0,Ygg2,,,"No, it doesn't. What this episode tells us is that humans often have frequent false positives, when it comes to pattern matching. This is common in most animal, and is the part how we perceive the world. Our limbic, fast-acting system works like this, when it spots a pattern that matches some kind of known ""threat"" reacts to it quickly. This kind of pattern matching is flawed as evolution has optimized for numerous false positives over false negatives (e.g. the one time you mistake a bear for a tree is deadlier than when you confuse a rock with a poisonous snake). This kind of input is bad in cases where false negative are as bad as false positives.<p>This somewhat flawed system, supplies our rational system with said bad input. In other words, garbage in, garbage out. This would have happened regardless of game, as long as one opponent is human and under some pressure, he would make a faulty guess and make the same mistake. This happens in a variety of games, from Chess to Starcraft to Street Fighter. As long as game has some pattern matching, it will be affected. So I'm pretty sure it applies to Go as well.<p>When you move up the ladder in a game, you start understanding how opponent mind functions and you make certain optimizations. You don't want to mentally exert yourself in all matches so you pick up a routine, that doesn't task the brain much and use it to weed out the lesser opponents. From time to time someone will use a totally different pattern which is when you mentally turn yourself on and start analyzing their moves, to figure out their next move. The presumptions your mind makes can often be exploited by a totally new/random enemy which screws up your evaluation model. This explains why people new to game have that ""begginer's luck"" effect. They can't value moves right, so they use a completely foreign way to play. For example in Street Fighter you expect your opponent to attack you with his far range fireball, which are that character's best weapon, so your prepare to block, but instead the newbie mashes button and starts throwing you around like a ragdoll. Of course good players will spot the newbie and change their play accordingly, however it might take some time for that.<p><a href=""http://www.sirlin.net/ptw-book/the-invincible-and-the-beast.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sirlin.net/ptw-book/the-invincible-and-the-beast....</a><p><a href=""http://www.sirlin.net/articles/yomi-layer-3-knowing-the-mind-of-the-opponent.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sirlin.net/articles/yomi-layer-3-knowing-the-mind...</a>",1348764594

I would even go as far to say that people who are not doing it are leaving some latent ability at the table. This is also true of sleep and nutrition, not just exercise.<p>I do want to remark briefly on what is admittedly a minor point that you made, namely that triathlons are highly recommended ""... even if just doing sprint/olympic/half distance."" It is a common misconception that the longer the distance, the more difficult or meritorious it is to complete. However, this is not true: It is not the case that one races an Ironman at the same intensity that s/he would for, say, a sprint-distance triathlon; rather, in order to last the entire duration of the longer distance, s/he is racing less intensely. (A person who performs a sprint-distance triathlon at the intensity s/he can hold for an entire Ironman is not racing the distance.)<p>Let's go to running for a concrete example. A topnotch overall pace in the marathon is 4:50/mile. But a miler will run a single mile in 3:50, a whole minute faster than marathon pace. (Note that these are typical competitive times rather than world-record times.)<p>With all this said, I would be remiss not to say that I agree with the overall sentiment that one should take baby steps rather than brashly pursuing unreasonable goals.<p>In response to your final question, I haven't done triathlons since college. At the moment, I am working on getting into shape to finally break 5:00 for the mile run. Next up is breaking 1:00 in the 100-meter swim. I'm still figuring out what a reasonable goal is for cycling... maybe 5 miles in 10 min.?<p>After I have all the pieces, I'll put them together and start doing triathlons again :-).",1348764411

After weeks of discussions and meetings and specifications, it's difficult to remember all the details, nuances, and dependencies that simply need to get addressed before project completion. It's simply not professional to ""forget"" to address a legitimate, solvable issue raised offhand in a meeting 4 months ago. It's fine if the issue isn't solved, but at least it remains in the hopper and it is known.<p>Simple example:<p><pre><code>  Product  
  - Features I'm excited to work on   
  -- the new customer lookup workflow  
  -- the Google mapping API

  - Features Customer has requested   
  -- bulk download and emailing of electrical schematics documents  
  -- text ripping of PDF invoice documents
</code></pre>
Here's the kind of discussion that would ensue as a result of the above 6 nodes: 
- How come only invoices need to have their text ripped? It's no more or less trouble to rip text from 1000 documents vs 1000000 documents. 
Wouldn't it be a nice feature to impress the customer with fulltext fuzzy search of all their marketing and technical documents as well? I remember that conversation - one of the engineering people asked me whether this was possible a few months back. 
Hmm, this sounds like a document management system. I'm trying to reinvent the wheel. This must have already been solved.<p>----<p>As a result of asking ""why X for foo here, and not X for bar there"", it's easy to be comprehensive and thorough. That is the secret sauce of FreeMind. If you organize the tasks and ideas sensibly, you can apply simple questions to analyze them and generate valuable ideas and ensure nothing is missing.<p>The second bit of secret sauce is: I have a deadline for end of week to demonstrate text ripping features of the accounting documents. But but but - the back of my mind is screaming - but that Google mapping API is really interesting and I bet I could get it done in less than ten minutes. How cool would be to map all their customer invoices on a map of the earth? 
And it would be really nice to research an open source document management system. 
And, and, it would be kind of neat to see if that system had a ""bulk upload/download"" feature - I mean, that sounds sensible enough?<p>All those questions/concerns/thoughts are unfocused, de-prioritized <i>noise</i>. I'm not getting anything accomplished and I'm in danger of getting even less accomplished if I follow any of those thoughts.<p>To combat this in FreeMind, I simply create another toplevel node called ""Today's focus"", drag the priorities into it from the other nodes, and then <i>fold all the other nodes</i> so that I don't become distracted.<p>... this, as evidenced by this sprawling post, still requires discipline to work. :)",1348763886

Which meant ""put the 58th bit of the plaintext into the first position, put the 50th bit into the second position, etc, and THEN run through the encryption algorithm.""<p>At the time, it was totally unclear why you had rearrange the bits in this very exact way. After all, you were about to encrypt it (and obliterate any plaintext patterns) anyway. And would it be as strong if you started with the 57th bit, instead of the 58th? The whole thing seemed so arbitrary.<p>Now it's true that this is robust to differential cryptanalysis, but it's <i>also</i> true that these bit permutations significantly slow down software implentations of DES. <i>But it's trivial to implement the initial permutation in hardware.</i><p>In the 1970s, the hardware required to crack DES costed $20,000,000 US dollars [1] (about $120 million in today's dollar [2]). The general tinfoil-theory at the time was that 1) only the NSA had the resources to build such a machine and 2) by forcing DES to use this initial permutation, the NSA was giving themselves a significant ""head-start"" over everybody else using software to crack DES.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.krapp.org/hydra/courses/analysis/3-DataEn.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.krapp.org/hydra/courses/analysis/3-DataEn.pdf</a> (PDF)

That would be prescriptive.</i><p>To me, that's not the line between prescriptive and descriptive linguists.  I think both say what's right and wrong, but there's different connotations to their answers.  Prescriptive linguists see the language as more static and more rooted in the past.  Descriptive linguists see the language as more dynamic and based in the present.  I think a prescriptive linguist would basically say that ""aks"" is wrong ""because it's wrong"", and that a big chunk of the population using it wouldn't make it right.  A descriptive linguist would say it's wrong because if you use it you'll sound stupid to most of the population.  There's nothing intrinsically wrong with the word, though, and if enough people start using it, it will become ""right"".<p>Obviously, this division is very fuzzy and is really a question of degree.<p>> <i>I'm told that's a regional variation.

I might go ask a descriptive linguist about the term ""aks"", and they might explain that it's common in certain neighborhoods around major cities but that educated urban types don't use it, that in the south rural residents don't use it but some suburban residents around the hub cities do, etc.  And that's all great and educational, but then I'm going to ask ""Is it American English?"" I'm either going to get a hand-wavy ""it depends"" answer that involves repeating the descriptions above and telling me nothing useful, or a straight answer that is effectively prescriptive.<p>The questions are not just ""does anyone say X?"", but also ""should I say X?"".

4581419,comment,4580350,4580350,6,0,andrewcooke,,,"this is explained a lot better at <a href=""http://www.mpg.de/6362003/water-ice-crystal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mpg.de/6362003/water-ice-crystal</a> :<p><i>In ice crystals, the water molecules arrange themselves in a six-sided, or hexagonal, to use the scientific term, spatial lattice. Each water molecule forms chemical bonds, so-called hydrogen bonds, to four adjacent molecules. This honeycomb crystal lattice of water ice requires more space than liquid water, which is unusual. As long as the water clusters have not reached the minimum size for a crystal, the Gttingen experiment presents them with a dilemma. The experiments take place at around minus 180 to minus 150 degrees Celsius - the molecules are therefore much too cold for a liquid. For a crystal, however, they are still too few in number. The tiny clusters escape this quandary by forming a type of liquid that has clotted in the cold: they form a rather disordered, amorphous spatial lattice.</i><p><i>If the cluster now grows, the water molecules at its core can change at some stage from the disordered chemical game into the crystalline structure by each of them taking four neighbours by the chemical hand. 275 water molecules thus create the initial beginnings of a real ice crystal with hexagonal structure in the interior of the cluster. To begin with, this structure is still slightly deformed; however, as the cluster grows in size, this interior grows to become a nicely ordered ice crystal, while the outer layers remain amorphous. When there are 475 molecules, the very core is already perfect, says Buck.</i><p>also, <a href=""http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2012/sep/21/how-many-water-molecules-does-it-take-to-make-ice"" rel=""nofollow"">http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2012/sep/21/how-man...</a>",1348763204

company - <a href=""http://www.primeengineering.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.primeengineering.net</a> - for nearly as long as I can remember
(well, he worked for a company that was bought out by Siemens prior to that).
I've been inundated with the knowledge of what it takes to produce doohickeys at
scale, whatever those doohickeys may be, since I was like 5.  It's fascinating,
and I wish more people were cognizant of all that goes into our modern society's
niceties.<p>When he installs new equipment, there's a sub-day shutdown usually, to install
massive lines of equipment into a warehouse.  He's always busy on, say,
Christmas, because a warehouse can typically just barely manage to afford to
shut down for 16 hours on that day (or other holidays) since the warehouse
employees want to be at home with their families.  If there are problems with
the installation (and there always are, because tolerances on everything are so
tight) then they have to be resolved <i>right there</i> in a crazy short timeframe.<p>I wrote some PLC software for him back right out of high school, to manage a
heat element for a shrink wrapping portion of a particular line.  We got a
certain input from the other components in the line (so the spec said) to
specify how long we needed to run before cutting, in milliseconds.  Their specs
lied, and they weren't sending us anything remotely like a serial data stream
specifying the time before cutting, so while everyone was installing the
hardware I had to derive from the data stream we <i>could</i> see what the timing
needed to be and 'test' it (more 'run some plastic and cut it and measure it'
tests than unit tests, yes?).  It was super stressful, but it was also insanely
fun.  Once the install was done (16 hours on the dot, loaded the code as the
timer ran out) the machinery started and has run uninterrupted for on the order
of 12 years now.  Most people aren't aware that this is the sort of thing that
goes into modern manufacturing :)",1348762564

4581303,comment,4579883,4580387,2,0,talmand,,,"I feel the only reason that Netscape was considered a threat by Microsoft was because Microsoft made them into a threat to be dominated and crushed. It's true that Netscape was working on things that could have potentially lowered the value of the OS market but that wasn't just Microsoft's sole source of revenue. Unless Netscape released products that totally replaced Microsoft's line of software then people, especially businesses, were going to continue purchasing Windows.<p>You are quite correct it was a hugely impressive pivot for Microsoft, even though they claimed there was no such pivot since the web was part of the plan. Funny that Win95 didn't initially ship with a browser nor did it install TCP/IP by default but they tried to convince people that it was a ""web OS"" from the beginning. Then they did their typical thing for the time; create a browser that they eventually released for free, then make it required for Windows, start duplicating other Netscape products to undercut them, and then claim it was their intention from the beginning the whole time. Netscape's demise was just a natural outcome of their superior planning and execution. The Dept of Justice eventually disagreed with them but Netscape was already dead in the water by then.<p>Now, considering that the result of all this was the era of IE6 that we are just now starting to get out of over 10 years later, I would say that the Internet would have been better off without their pivot. Granted the tools you mentioned are nice but there's no reason to think that Netscape, or someone else, wouldn't have done similar things and possibly better since they most likely wouldn't have tied them to a specific OS. These days hardly anyone makes web tools tied to one OS, mostly Microsoft does that.<p>As for Microsoft, where would they be today if they hadn't crushed Netscape? I would say that, because of the competition, they would have made better products and be stronger overall. Once they crushed Netscape they stagnated a great deal that eventually caused them to fall behind, as you point out. Their complacency allowed others to step in to become serious competitors that finally resulted in the web tools you mentioned.<p>I would even say that because of them crushing Netscape with tactics, used elsewhere as well, that resulted in huge problems with governments around the world caused them to be reluctant to be aggressive; which resulted in them missing the mobile window. They are just now seriously trying to get into that game.<p>Of course, most of this is based on hindsight, which is easy to comment on.",1348761952

If 99% of people use some construction, then even the most prescriptive of linguists will probably consider it correct.  But what about 40%?  20%?  Even for a descriptive linguist, the question of ""do people say X"" is fuzzy.  Some people say ""X"" for almost any ""X"".  Some people say ""aks"" instead of ""ask"", but the vast majority of people would agree that's wrong.",1348761815

If you want the best, you have to pay the best.<p>-Identify the strengths and weakness of everyone in your team. Then work with them accordingly.<p>- Always encourage a culture of open and honest communication from both sides. Do regular team meeetings and also periodical one on ones with individual members. Encourage them to talk about anything.<p>- Trust in your team. You hired the best, now let them do their job. Don't micro manage.<p>- Give positive feedback whenever you can openly. Saying ""You did a great job"" adds a lot of value and don't underestimate these words. Equally, provide constructive criticism if necessary and always do it in private.<p>- Be flexible with the team's work styles and hours. If someone takes a 2 hour lunch break but stays late and gets shit done, thats fine. As long as important deadlines and deliverables don't slip, do not be a time police.<p>- Last but not the least, understand that a good manager/boss is one of the most critical factors in deciding whether to stay or leave a team/company. People seldom quit a company, they quit their boss.",1348761771

So, not as much for me as a Python person, until the ecosystem evolves. Too bad, because it doesn't seem like there was much of a win from giving up forward compatibility.

Every reason which you have for your competitors not wanting to touch this niche is a reason for advertisers not wanting to pay to advertise to your users.  Can you identify some local Nigerian companies which are making money, on the Internet, legitimately, from Nigerians?<p>If not then your model is to be one step ahead of the banstick on Google.

PHPList is used to manage the Mailing list on phpBB.com (the website).

462035,comment,461076,461076,0,0,fhars,,,"The main difference between this scheme and propotional division becomes apparent if the heirs discover another 100 hidden in a cupboard after the initial distribution has been decided on. Should they start a new round or should they distribute it as if they had known about it from the start? With a porportional distribution scheme, the outcome is the same, with the talmudic scheme, the outcomes might differ and you have to decide which one is more consistent or just.\nSo both schemes give a consistent allocation of assets in simple cases, but proportional distribution is far easier to generalize to consistent allocations in complex situations.",1233559464

I'd suggest reading a broad variety of sources, including some (mostly, actually) mainstream ones.  With economics, there is an unfortunate tendency for ""free on the internet"" to mean ""extremist"", which is quite different from all the free programming docs we are used to hoovering up.

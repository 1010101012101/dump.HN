I like how he writes because he makes a point and then tells a story (usually his) to support that point (public speaking keystone).<p>I've been fortunate to go to several conferences on my company dime. The best was the Colorado Software Summit in 2000 where they were talking about Ruby as the next big thing. However, none of these paid conferences match up to the BarCamp-type events and even informal meetups at bars to drink and discuss projects. I think there is a certain artificial short-term hype that is instilled in you when you fly to a conference and get hyped up on the energy and excitement and marketing parties - it is not sustainable once you return. I find that I enjoy local meetups more now - more long-term, less virtual, and you might even become friends.<p>Daniel Tenner's previous piece ""Dealing with Impossible Crises"" is worth reading if you missed it the first time<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=552581"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=552581</a>",1240404935

I've been working on a tool for this in my spare time over the last several months, and I hope to release it sometime this summer. Pinning down what's ""similar enough"" is subtle, and if you go too far, it complains that boilerplate-y code in e.g. Java is unnecessarily redundant. (While this is certainly <i>true</i>, it's not useful.)<p>I look forward to the upcoming structured programming revolution. Some day, people will <i>use subroutines</i>!",1240404567

You make it sound as if someone is attempting to force someone else to agree with his theories and conclusions, or to prevent someone from agreeing with opposing (or any other) set of conclusions and theories.<p>I see no evidence of that, and come think of it, I do not see evidence of that figure ""being bandied about as though it were an actual scientific fact"", if you can provide evidence to the contrary, please, by all means do so, or better yet, disprove Norvig's theories and conclusions yourself, no one is stopping you.",1240404425

By that I mean, a population of 100 active players (active means using the website at least once per week) would result in some 50 dollars per year.

573784,comment,572730,573669,0,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>There isn't even enough resolution on my screen to tell the difference between a good font and a great one.</i><p>A decade ago, when 1024x768 on a 17"" monitor was doing OK and high quality icons were 32x32 in 256 colours, they might have said the same thing. Today, screens with twice that pixel count aren't unusual, and everyone from operating systems to web sites is using much more detailed icons.<p>By the same token, low resolution screens are one of the places where the difference between a good font and a great font really stands out. It's not the same difference you'd see on paper out of a 2400dpi printer. In fact, the qualities that make a font good for screen use are quite different to those that make a font good for print use. But to maximise the visual appeal and, more importantly, the legibility and readability of text on screen in a world where on-screen reading is increasingly taking over from other media, we need people who understand how to achieve the best results with what precious screen real estate we have.<p>Alas, as with most things in graphic design and typography, good work is rarely noticed because it's good work, while bad work is rarely noticed because people don't know the difference (but still read slower, make more mistakes, and get tired sooner).",1240401624

7852821,comment,7851625,7851625,16,0,munificent,,,"I&#x27;m going to use this as a little example of why compiling to JS is hard. I work on the Dart team, and people often ask what the big deal about JS compilation is. Opal&#x27;s compiler is a good example of why it can be hard.<p>I want to stress, though, that I&#x27;m not singling Opal out here. I think Opal is a really cool project, and I hope it works well for lots of people. It&#x27;s just a good example language since it&#x27;s on HN right now.<p>Let&#x27;s compile this Ruby code to JS with Opal:<p><pre><code>    a = 0\n    10000000.times do\n      a = a + 1\n    end\n    puts a\n</code></pre>\nOpal gives us:<p><pre><code>    /* Generated by Opal 0.6.2 */\n    (function($opal) {\n      var $a, $b, TMP_1, self = $opal.top, $scope = $opal, nil = $opal.nil, $breaker = $opal.breaker, $slice = $opal.slice, a = nil;\n\n      $opal.add_stubs([&#x27;$times&#x27;, &#x27;$+&#x27;, &#x27;$puts&#x27;]);\n      a = 0;\n      ($a = ($b = (10000000)).$times, $a._p = (TMP_1 = function(){var self = TMP_1._s || this;\n\n      return a = a[&#x27;$+&#x27;](1)}, TMP_1._s = self, TMP_1), $a).call($b);\n      return self.$puts(a);\n    })(Opal);\n</code></pre>\nWe&#x27;ll compare it to some vanilla JS:<p><pre><code>    var a = 0;\n    for (var i = 0; i < 10000000; i++) {\n        a = a + 1;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t care at all that the generated code is a little funny looking. That&#x27;s fine. Opal&#x27;s code is actually pretty readable to me. What is a problem for some (many?) users is the <i>performance</i>.<p>You&#x27;ll note that Opal did <i>not</i> compile &quot;a + 1&quot; to &quot;a + 1&quot;. Instead it generated &quot;a[&#x27;$+&#x27;](1)&quot;. That&#x27;s because Ruby&#x27;s arithmetic semantics are different from JavaScript&#x27;s. To implement those semantics correctly, it needs to use a method call instead of using the built-in arithmetic.<p>We can profile the two using this fiddle: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/3UtNf/1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/3UtNf/1/</a><p>On my laptop, the Opal code is 264 <i>times</i> slower than the raw JS code. In other words, it runs at 0.3% of the speed of the JS code. Now imagine sacrificing that much perf on a mobile device. That&#x27;s enough to make the language unsuitable for many real-world use cases.<p>This isn&#x27;t intractable, though. You just need to compile math down to real JS arithmetic operators <i>when JS&#x27;s semantics line up with your language&#x27;s</i> (which typically means, when you&#x27;re suring you&#x27;ve got numbers and not some other type with a user-defined operator).<p>Determining where you can do that is the hard part. It requires type analysis. Doing that well in a language that doesn&#x27;t have a sound static type system requires whole-program analysis. It&#x27;s extremely complex, monolithic, and leads to very strange output code.<p>This is why, for example, Dart&#x27;s dart2js compiler is so complex and heavyweight. It <i>does</i> do this kind of analysis. It compiles this Dart program:<p><pre><code>    main() {\n      var a = 0;\n      for (var i = 0; i < 10000000; i++) {\n        a = a + 1;\n      }\n      print(a);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nto this JS:<p><pre><code>    function() {\n      var a, i, line;\n      for (a = 0, i = 0; i < 10000000; ++i)\n        ++a;\n      line = &quot;&quot; + a;\n      H.printString(line);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThat has the same performance as the JS code. The reason it does this is because it knows &quot;a&quot; is a number. If we change the Dart code to:<p><pre><code>    class Foo {\n      operator +(other) => this;\n    }\n\n    main() {\n      var a = new Foo();\n      for (var i = 0; i < 10000000; i++) {\n        a = a + 1;\n      }\n      print(a);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThen generated JS changes completely:<p><pre><code>    function() {\n        var i, line;\n        for (i = 0; i < 10000000; ++i)\n          ;\n        line = H.S(new Q.Foo());\n        H.printString(line);\n      }\n</code></pre>\nInterestingly, here you can see the compiler understood that the &quot;+&quot; operator on Foo always returns the same object and was able to inline the call to it and then hoist it out of the loop completely.<p>This is the kind of stuff you need to do if you want to have a language that compiles to JS and (unlike, say CoffeeScript and TypeScript) has semantics that aren&#x27;t very very similar to JS.",1401987354

Taught us a lot about how not to write software (<i>The Mythical Man Month</i>), but were hardly unique in that, or the second system syndrome.<p>In a pattern I observed at the time, companies that really screwed up their disk drives, as in too many failures in the field, lost so much brand equity they were forced to sell the remnants to another company.

I have been doing freelance consulting for years and I know I&#x27;m going to steal a number of his ideas.<p>Second, here are some additional thoughts, based on my experience doing similarly-sized gigs for similar clients.<p>1) To start with, just to encourage you, this is a very doable project that can be very lucrative to you (>$10k), helpful to the client, and can open the door to a lot of fun side gigs. This is the best part of consulting.<p>2) When looking at your first side job, the temptation will be to come up with a price based on your day job&#x27;s equivalent hourly rate. <i>Do not do this.</i> This is easily $100+/hr work. For a real estate firm, your app may be generating millions in revenue/cost savings over a few years, and although it&#x27;s a simple little project to you, building a webapp is deep magick to a business user. Try to pitch and charge based on <i>value</i>.<p>You should know your costs/equivalent hourly rate, but only as a bare minimum so you are never working at a loss.<p>3) Based on the fact that this project is mostly rebuilding an existing Excel spreadsheet (Pro Tip: you can get a lot of business from simply &quot;rebuilding Excel worksheets!&quot;), it seems like you could spec it out enough where you could offer a fixed price. You can use tptacek&#x27;s approach of quoting X days at $YYYY per day, or a total fixed price.<p>You always have the option of going hourly though. Some clients will prefer this, but it can limit your total compensation. You can charge $X0,000 - $X00,000 for a given app (remember: deep magick) but you can&#x27;t charge $X000 per hour. Do quote high though. My favorite advice is &quot;pick the most ridiculous semi-realistic number you can think of, then double it.&quot; You can always offer a discount for Friends & Family, New Customer, Summer Sale, whatever.<p>4) Be vague about delivery times if you cannot take 1-2 weeks off work to complete the project. But plan to have regular deliverables/signs of life to keep them on board. Think about mockups/wireframes you can deliver.<p>5) Ask for at least some of the payment up-front. This will ensure they are serious, and motivate you to deliver once you receive money. :)<p>Home these ramblings are helpful. Welcome to the world of Real Consulting!",1401985861

If I spend two days at a hackathon working on smp, do I have to charge the hotel to a different account? Can I pretend the libressl work I did for free this week is exchangeable for paid work during a hackathon? It very quickly becomes a mess.<p>I think you get a pretty decent return on investment even if your dollars support openbsd features you don&#x27;t use. All of us working on libressl are working in it because we work on openbsd, and we work on openbsd because others have made it a viable platform for us. Basically you may not care about openbsd desktops, but I do, and I&#x27;m only working on libressl because of that. Paying me market rates for this work would get a lot less done.<p>Particular example: libressl exists in part because of previous work done on exploit mitigation. Without that, there&#x27;d be no libressl.<p>Or, to put it another way, if you were to donate to me, I&#x27;d probably turn around and forward that money to openbsd foundation anyway.<p>All that said, you can mention that your donation is for libressl. That doesn&#x27;t guarantee anything, but I&#x27;m sure there are unofficial tallies.",1401984255

The responsibility customers have to pick up their kids on time is directly tied to how much it&#x27;s going to cost them &quot;feeling bad about being late&quot; can be thought of as a cost in this example.  All this example shows is &quot;not feeling bad&quot; is worth more than $5 and all they need to do to &quot;solve&quot; this new source of revenue is to raise the late fee until fewer people are late to pick up their kids than when there was no price at all.  But what they really ought to do is raise the price until they reach an optimal profit per late child.<p>It&#x27;s plain to see that altruism isn&#x27;t enough to keep enough tor nodes going. I&#x27;ve never even considered running one until now because of the real costs and risk it incurs upon me. Now I&#x27;m actually considering it because it might be worth it. This is a good thing and there are more people willing do to something for money than people willing to do something out of the kindness of their heart to people they will never meet or interact with in any way.",1401984130

E.g., family is supposed to go to a birthday party, but at the last minute the abusive dad blows up at something the mom says and refuses to let anybody go until she apologizes. The kids pressure mom to give a false apology so they can go. If she doesn&#x27;t, she&#x27;s the one who ruined the outing, not dad. If she does, she confirms that she&#x27;s the problem, and later the kids are upset when she doesn&#x27;t stick up for them. Meanwhile, the dad&#x27;s tantrum is entirely out of scope of discussion, as is the repeated pattern of behavior.<p>The governmental theory that they could try to hoover up every detail of every digital interaction and never get found out was always insane. It wasn&#x27;t a question of <i>if</i> that would come out, it was when. I find it hard to believe nobody internally asked that, but either way they are the ones to blame for the consequences, not Snowden.<p>[1] Lundy Bancroft&#x27;s &quot;Why Does He Do That?&quot;, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Why-Does-He-That-Controlling/dp/0425191656"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Why-Does-He-That-Controlling/dp/042519...</a>.

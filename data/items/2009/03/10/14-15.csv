Possession is hard to prosecute, and admitting to once using some weed on the Internet is even harder.  (""Yeah, I just said I smoked weed so that people would think I was cool.""  Case dismissed.)<p>I suppose they could get a search warrant for your place, but this is so exceedingly unlikely that it is not worth worrying about.  Pot is technically illegal, but only the most flagrant displays of use are worth the government's time to prosecute.  (And, it's decriminalized in many places now.

If we average it out over all the loans made by everybody, I don't think this is necessarily inflationary.<p>Even if the miner doesn't find copper, he's still obligated to pay back his loans. Maybe the bank seizes his property or he pays it off slowly from some regular job where he generates some other value. Either way it will work out in the end, although perhaps the effect is slightly inflationary until he pays off his loan.<p>And you have to take into consideration all the other loans made. If there is some other miner whose enterprise works out, then, if risk estimation techniques are good, it balances the one that failed.<p>When the techniques that everyone is using to estimate risk are totally wrong, you get the USA in 2009.<p>Again: not an economist.",1236696956

That doesn't mean everybody should succeed equally. This idea that we should <i>all be the same person</i> is twisted and wrong and actively harmful.<p>This applies to phones, too. You have a choice of phone. You know what phone I use? It's this model by Samsung that doesn't allow <i>any</i> applications because I think applications on a standard phone are bunk. I don't complain. I like that my phone makes calls and sends text.<p>It's worth saying again, because people like you <i>really</i> like ignoring it to complain: <i>Apple changed the mobile industry forever.</i> The sheer <i>existence</i> of the iPhone changed the game plan of everybody else on the planet. Now the iPhone's been out for 2 years, and <i>nobody</i> has a user experience that comes <i>close</i>! I've used other multitouch phones. They're all pathetic. When the iPhone came out, it was the announcement of a vast reform in the way phones worked.<p>Apple didn't have applications. Nobody cared. Suddenly, Apple releases this App Store, which has become a hundred-million-app success in a year, and people are complaining because this magical thing they didn't have before is imperfect. It's like Louis C.K.'s routine. Everything is <i>amazing</i>, and yet nobody is happy, because we all feel entitled. (I'm not saying complaining is bad if it's constructive, but your response unlike the OP's was just lazy and fat and ugly and I hate that attitude.)<p>You don't like Apple? Go buy other phones. Buy one like mine, with small keys and a bad screen, because that's all you're getting from other groups until Apple made their phone. Revel in the lack of user experience. Note the lack of decent apps on <i>those</i> phones, too.<p>You want equal treatment, you'd better stop dealing with the human race. I was forced into working in groups for classes in school, under this notion that we all can contribute equal parts. I got worse grades in classes because people would mess things up. At some point I started doing all the work myself, because I couldn't stand this equal distribution. It made me into a manager rather than an employee. I prefer the auteur route, where unless you have somebody as smart as you working on something, you do it yourself and don't complain.<p>You don't like that? Say goodbye to art. Know who was dictatorial and unfair? Stanley Kubrick, who referred to actors as tools to be disposed of and who disliked all but a handful of actors (the rest of whom called him abusive). James Joyce, who produced two novels so complex that people refused to work fairly with them for years, who insisted on not compromsing his work. (Or Ayn Rand if you'd prefer something more ""pop"" - she refused the notion that anybody could edit her writing.) Pretty much everything awesome comes from somebody who's unfair and doesn't treat people equally and gets done the stuff that's supposed to get done.<p>Now buckle up and stop complaining unless you've got a better solution.*<p>*Switching to a worse phone system doesn't count as a solution.",1236695766

I don't think it necessarily impairs cognitive performance as much as it makes it seem less important.  If we were passing around a joint and before I had to hit it again, I had to multiply two 3-digit numbers together and translate a a paragraph into spanish, I could.  But smoking makes you less likely to approach a problem like that.  It allows you to take in perspectives other than your own.<p>While smoking, I have uncovered repressed memories of childhood, resolved interpersonal conflicts, and redesigned interfaces.<p>Calling a high person ""stupid"" is like calling someone stupid because they speak a different language, or calling a child stupid because they ask a question about something that seems trivial.<p>I've always felt that weed helps one reconcile disparate concepts.  When you take off all your different hats and just look at the problem with a more basic human perspective, without the little compartments into which we organize all our issues.  Of course, some people can achieve this level of perspective without drugs, more power to them.  Similarly, some people react differently to marijuana - bummer for them. I smoke regularly, but not when I need to code - it's not that I can't code, it's just horrendously unappealing when high.<p>The bottom line is just knowing what helps you accomplish what and when to take part.

I believe this is caused by artificially high dopamine production from the smoking, conversely resulting in lower general dopamine levels when sober.<p>Also, I am one of those persons for whom pot impairs social interaction. I felt increasingly alienated and only felt 'normal' after two-three days of sobriety.

To hear some people tell the tale you would think it is a black hole of wasted time sucking out any ability or desire to improve the product.<p>If you treat it like an engineering problem, it really doesn't have to bury you.  Improve the product, get less support requests.  Improve your answers, get less support requests.  Proactively answer questions on the site and in the app, get less support requests.  Provide self-help tools, get less support requests.  Do a bang-up job on those emails you do get, get less support requests.<p>I used to work as a CSR and picked up the habit of charting stuff (it is much harder to improve things you can't measure).  Since January 1st I've passed out something like 16k trials and had about 225 sales, and that has resulted in about 40 emails to me (including pre-sales inquiries).<p>That's about one-fifth the mails-per-sale ratio I had when I started out.  Measure it, make improvements, do more of what works.  (Plus, the less mail you get the more you can afford to blow folks away on the ones you have to answer personally.)",1236693768

Once one realizes what's most important, one can focus on those goals and not worry about making excuses for the other things.<p>There's no ""shame"" in not starting a business, not majoring in a certain subject, etc, except what society tries to tell us and society is trying to tell us that 100 different things are important.  It's up to us to find what our destination is and head there, in spite of what other people say.",1236693611

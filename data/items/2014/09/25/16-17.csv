Like how, oh, I don&#x27;t know, another company these days is being shoved in our Face(book)s as a model of success for no other reason than its strategic value to the intell community.  Or how Steve Wynn was marketed as a genius developer but it turned out he was just a front for the mob who needed stay in and compete with corporations but couldn&#x27;t raise funds on wall street due to criminal records.  Or how Bill Gates was a &quot;genius&quot; because he insisted on licensing Winblows instead of selling it even though history  went on to show that he actually tried to sell it to IBM numerous times but IBM&#x27;s then CEO, who was a friend of his family and lived a few blocks away in the same neighborhood actually came with the idea to the table and insisted that IBM license the software instead of buying it, which basically set Microsoft with a huge source of un-earned cash just as it was starting up and helped create the mythos of the &quot;genius&quot; entrepreneur.<p>The only thing this is proof of is inexperience, gullibility  and lack of insight into the real workings of the world.<p>You want to see a good example of an entrepreneur? Look at Jack Ma.  No social background, no spoon in mouth, just a lot of optimism hard work and a sense that success can be mutual and open-looped.  Started in China, a country notorious for government/business/family-relation corruption but chose not to seek help from the obvious places and instead earned business the hard way - going door to door and manufacturers and asking them to sign up, one boring conversation at a time.<p>You couldn&#x27;t make a hollywood movie out of that because its so boring.  But it&#x27;s reality.  Any startup story that can have a hollywood movie around it is usually just a public business sockpuppet around a group of allied interests with money to throw around at the next &quot;genius&quot; they want to prop up to create a magical story/script for the next IPO.",1411664018

Your comment is roughly equivalent to saying &quot;You can tell who is a successful species on the savannah by those who talk shit about Mufasa.&quot; The truth is that apex predators like lions are very cool, but, by biomass and evolutionary longevity <i>not</i> nearly the most successful animals in any ecosystem.<p>And, uniquely to humans, there is a meta-game, wherein what we say about the world influences the world. This effect is so strong that we can indeed <i>redefine</i> what success means with our words. Success in nature is, unambiguously, survival. Live long enough to reproduce, die happy. But we humans can and often do alter this definition. And we do it in economics as well. The traditional definition of capitalist success is (to paraphrase) &quot;die a billionaire&quot;.

Money is, in the end, just a kind of primordial &quot;like&quot;. Larry has amassed billions of &quot;likes&quot;. But how much more value could he have created had he not worried so much about localizing the rewards?<p>I&#x27;m glad you want to be an apex predator, but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll get very far by insisting that the world only needs (or would only benefit from having) apex predators.",1411662894

And, like you said, performing an exhaustive exploration of all values is out of the question.<p>So I&#x27;d try property testing instead. Relevant properties in this case are associativity, commutativity, etc.<p>As an example, I&#x27;d try writing properties such as:<p><pre><code>  for all X, Y: add(X, Y) = add(Y, X)\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m not arguing that everything can be tested like this, or that the properties are always easy to formulate; but when they are, I think this is the superior approach.<p>The tools that I&#x27;m aware of that can do this (such as QuickCheck or ScalaCheck) come from statically typed languages, though I don&#x27;t see why they couldn&#x27;t be used with dynamically typed languages.<p>The point is that this starts to look a lot closer to static typing and &quot;testing generalities&quot;, philosophically, than what proponents of dynamic typing + unit testing propose.

Since environment variables are so &quot;leaky&quot; -- they are often spread between processes without any sort of checks -- there are essentially innumerable ways for an exploit to reach a vulnerable version of bash, both remotely and offline.",1411662455

I should note first that most interesting datastores you&#x27;ll run in the cloud will end up needing instance stores for performance reasons anyway--you want sequential read perf, you know?--and so this is really just extending it to other nodes that, if you&#x27;re writing twelve-factor apps, should pop back up without a hitch anyway. (If you&#x27;re not writing twelve-factor apps...why not?)<p>Straight failover, with 1:1 mirroring on all nodes? You&#x27;re massively degraded, unless you&#x27;ve significantly overprovisioned in the happy case, <i>but you have all your stuff</i>. Amazon will (once it unscrews itself from the thrash) start spinning up replacement machines in healthy AZs to replace the dead machines, and if you&#x27;ve done it right they can come up and rejoin the cluster, getting synced back up. (Building that part, auto-scaling groups and replacing dead instances, is probably the hardest part of this whole thing, even with a provisioner like Chef or Puppet.) If you&#x27;re using a quorum for leader election or you&#x27;re replicating shard data, being in three AZs actually only protects you from a single AZ interruption. Amazon has lost (or partially lost, I wasn&#x27;t doing AWS at the time so I&#x27;m a little fuzzy) two AZs simultaneously before, and so if you&#x27;re that sensitive to the failure case you want five AZs (quorum/sharding of 3, so you can lose two). I generally go with three, because in my estimation the likelihood of two AZs going down is low enough that I&#x27;m willing to roll the dice, but reasonable people can totally differ there.<p>If Amazon goes <i>down</i>, yes, you&#x27;re hosed, and you need to restore from your last S3 backup. But while that is possible, I consider that to be the least likely case (though you should have DR procedures for bringing it back, and you should test them). You have to figure out your acceptable level of risk; for mine, &quot;total failure&quot; is a low enough likelihood, and the rest of the Internet likely to be so completely boned that I should have time to come back online.<p>Thing is, EBS is not a panacea for any of this; I am pretty sure that a fast rolling bounce would leave most people not named Netflix dead on the ground and not really any better off for recovery than somebody who has to restore a backup.",1411662325

8367972,comment,8366745,8366745,16,0,PeterWhittaker,,,"Folks, for what it&#x27;s worth, here is a management briefing I wrote this morning. Please feel free to re-use, but please do give proper attribution. Please do comment and correct as appropriate.<p><i>Summary:</i> Briefing for management on activities to minimize impacts of the &quot;shellshock&quot; computer vulnerability.<p><i>Status:</i> Testing underway. Initial appraisals are that public-facing systems are likely not subject to shellshock. NOTE: The situation is fluid, due to the nature of the vulnerability. Personnel are also reaching out to hosting providers to assess the status of intervening systems.<p><i>What is it?</i> A vulnerability in a command interpreter found on the vast majority of Linux and UNIX systems, including web servers, development machines, routers, firewalls, etc. The vulnerability could allow an anonymous attacker to execute arbitrary commands remotely, and to obtain the results of these commands via their browser. The security community has nicknamed the vulnerability &quot;shellshock&quot; since it affects computer command interpreters known as shells.<p><i>How does it work?</i> Command interpreters, or &quot;shells&quot;, are the computer components that allow users to type and execute computer commands. Anytime a user works in a terminal window, they are using a command interpreter - think of the DOS command prompt. Some GUI applications, especially administrative applications, are in fact just graphical interfaces to command interpreters. The most common command interpreter on Linux and UNIX is known as the &quot;bash shell&quot;. Within the last several days, security researchers discovered that a serious vulnerability has been present in the vast majority of instances of bash for the last twenty years. This vulnerability allows an attacker with access to a bash shell to execute arbitrary commands. Because many web servers use system command interpreters to fulfill user requests, attackers need not have physical access to a system: The ability to issue web requests, using their browser or commonly-available command line tools, may be enough.<p><i>How bad could it be?</i> Very, very bad. The vulnerability may exist on the vast majority of Linux and UNIX systems shipped over the last 20 years, including web servers, development machines, routers, firewalls, other network appliances, printers, Mac OSX computers, Android phones, and possibly iPhones (note: It has yet to be established that smartphones are affected, but given that Android and iOS are variants of Linus and UNIX, respectively, it would be premature to exclude them). Furthermore, many such systems have web-based administrative interfaces: While many of these machines do not provide a &quot;web server&quot; in the sense of a server providing content of interest to the casual or &quot;normal&quot; user, many do provide web-based interfaces for diagnotics and administration. Any such system that provides dynamic content using system utilities may be vulnerable.<p><i>What is the primary risk?</i> There are two, data loss and system modification. By allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, the shellshock vulnerability may allow the attacker to both obtain data from a system and to make changes to system configuration. There is also a third risk, that of using affected systems to launch attacks against other systems, so-called &quot;reflector&quot; attacks: The arbitrary command specified by the attacker could be to direct a network utility against a third machine.<p><i>How easy is it to detect the vulnerability?</i> Surprising easily: A single command executed using ubiquitous system tools will reveal whether any particular web device or web server is vulnerable.<p><i>What are we doing?</i> Technical personnel are using these commands to test all web servers and other devices we manage and are working with hosting providers to ensure that all devices upon which we depend have been tested. When devices are determined to be vulnerable, a determination is made whether they should be left alone (e.g., if they are not public facing and patches are either not yet available or would be disruptive at this time, or if there are other mitigations or safeguards in place), patched (e.g., if patches are available and are low impact), or turned off (e.g., if patches are not available, risk is high, and the service is not mandate critical).<p>Updates to this briefing will provided as the situation develops.",1411662172

My understand is that some of these high dimensional theories of quantum gravity postulate colliding &#x27;membranes&#x27; and things but they are still very much in development and this calculation does nothing to further those theories along.<p>Another way I was thinking about it is that the initial singularity and creation of the universe is probably more a result of large scale, topological dynamics where this paper is concerned with more local, geometric dynamics.

In this post, you do -- sort of.<p>> Bob, nearer to the massive body, will see the same process take 1 - ε seconds to complete ...<p>If Bob and the process being observed are in the same frame of reference, Bob will see the process require a &quot;normal&quot; amount of time, i.e. a time consistent with classical physics. Alice will see Bob&#x27;s process require more time on her clock, from her perspective. Bob, in the gravity well, will see Alice&#x27;s time appear to be passing more quickly compared to his own.<p>> In effect, Bob has passed through one second of (Alice) time in only 1 - ε seconds of (local, to Bob) time.<p>This way of describing it is confusing. Here you are saying that Bob&#x27;s experience of time is equal to Alice&#x27;s time minus ε, when it&#x27;s the reverse -- Bob sees Alice&#x27;s time passing at 1 - ε, while his own time passes at a &quot;normal&quot; rate. It&#x27;s a matter of how one describes it, because I suspect you understand how this works, the only problem is the prose.<p>> That&#x27;s what I mean when I say &quot;pass through time / move along the time axis more quickly&quot;.<p>Again, it&#x27;s a matter of how one chooses to describe it, and it only proves the advantage of mathematics as a language. If we were discussing SR instead of GR, I would want to say, about the time experienced by (A)lice and (B)ob if (B)ob is moving at velocity v:<p>A = B / √(1-v^2/c^2)<p>B = A √(1-v^2/c^2)<p>In other words, Bob&#x27;s time is slowed relative to Alice&#x27;s time, <i>as observed from Alice&#x27;s frame of reference</i>.

Right.  And, right, mostly the\nprojects (A)-(O) do not illustrate low effort.  Okay.\nBut we can&#x27;t use those projects to conclude that\nthere are no projects, start ups, that follow what I\nsaid about ideas and that have have low execution\neffort.<p>So, for effort in execution, can we also have\nprojects that have low execution effort and, thus,\nare suitable for start ups?  Well, except maybe for\nthe project (L) RSA I listed, the projects in (A)-(O) do\nnot illustrate low effort.<p>But I do believe that, as we select projects, we can\nalso have some that follow what I described and also\nhave low execution effort.

Sure:  What I am saying\nis. so far in practice, mostly new for information\ntechnology start ups -- instead of what I described\npeople have followed what Altman described in his\nlecture.  I&#x27;m saying that there is a better way,\nheavily in the <i>planning</i>.<p>That what I am saying seems new for information\ntechnology start up can seem good news unless find\nthe thinking wrong.<p>Nutshell View:  I&#x27;m claiming that we can do good\nplanning and with a good plan execution can be\nroutine and the intended success low risk.  A key to\na reliable path from plan to success is some math\nfor the core of the product.  Another key is a\nproblem where the first good or a much better\nsolution is a &quot;must have&quot;.  My project examples\n(A)-(O) illustrated that such planning, the role of\nmath, routine execution with low risk, and &quot;must\nhave&quot; solutions are possible.

I would guess there are some of the string/brane theory models out there that postulate what caused the big bang but currently it is my understanding that whatever information was around about the cause of that singularity is not accessible to us.

(My office is $1 per s.f. per month!)  A huge building boom is finishing up in the SOMA area of the City with hundreds (maybe 1000+) new apartments entering the market. This is good news for downward pressure on rental prices.<p>2. <i>Convenience</i>: Within walking distance of both my office and my apartment are countless restaurants, markets, office supplies, banks, etc etc.  You can simply walk to what you need saving <i>so</i> much time over driving around on errands in rush hour traffic in the South Bay.  There are countless take-out food restaurants open until late at night to keep you coding with a reasonable diet, with many delivering to your door. (Chinese takeout costs about $7 for a main item - roughly $10 for a meal)<p>3. <i>Coolness</i>:  There are a lot of web companies in the city because it is such a great place to live.  Attracting hackers to work for you may be easier here.
Even the Large Corporate Web companies are setting up major operations in the City:<p><a href=""http://sanfrancisco.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2007/01/15/story22.html"">http://sanfrancisco.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2007/01/15/story22.html</a>

  a. Sailing in the Bay
  b. Biking - across the Golden Gate and you are into nature in no time.
  c. Beach - Many beaches in the area
  d. Skiing - As close as 2.5 - 3 hours away for some great slopes.
  d. Symphony/Opera/Theater/Movies galore, etc etc etc
  e. Night Life - Live music, etc etc etc.
  f. Wine Country - Only an hour drive to Napa County/Sonoma County - countless vineyards - great wine.<p>5. <i>Variety</i>:  San Francisco has many different neighborhoods that have entirely different cultures.  A few blocks in different directions will let you experience the unexpected.  (Usually good, ocassionally bad)<p>6. Ok, you're right, I'm biased.  I love living in the City.<p>7. Downside: The VC's and many angels are in the South Bay, but thats only a 30-40 min. drive away - or Caltrain ride.",1176404397

Another example is Powerset which has raised millions, has been touted as a google killer and hosted cool Valley parties--and is yet to launch. <p>My BS meter just shoots up when I know more about a start-up's PR success than its product.

12303,comment,12290,12297,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"I own a car, but use it only for driving to meetings (where a bike jersey is not the appropriate attire), shopping, or leaving town.  The transit system here is very good, and the bike lane system is getting better all the time (the bike lobby has growing political clout in the city).  Also, parking is a <i></i>&^<i>^ as the city uses tickets as a big revenue stream, so if you are illegal for only a few minutes, you'll get a ticket.  You will also save time by not having to park.<p>The downside is that the Muni rail system is not entirely reliable. Normally it takes me 30 minutes from door to door via Muni (N line - when it's raining which isn't that often), but it can take up to 50 if there is a problem which is about 20% of the time.  (Biking takes me 20 minutes or less).  Of course if you work out of your apartment, commuting is a non issue.",1176403549

The building is lame, too... unless you like living in an apartment that is like a college dorm or old folks home. <p>Regarding SF vs Palo Alto. SF is way more fun. But keep in mind historical patterns. How many successful startups have been started in SF? How many have been started up in the valley? <p>Valley based startups are more successful, simply because there is nothing else to do down there.",1176402270

All other things being equal, why should someone take a lower salary?  <p>And there are other factors.  If your compensation becomes a benchmark for the rest of the team, now your company is in real trouble.  You can't expect to hire key team members at less than the norm.  It just won't happen.  VCs know that.<p>Also, a VC's main job is to put out as much of their committed capital as possible into good deals. Allocating a large part of a preferred equity tranche to fund the maintenance and creation of a solid team is the right thing to  do.<p>And comparing with large companies is not apples to apples. That's a different world; here's an extreme example of that world:

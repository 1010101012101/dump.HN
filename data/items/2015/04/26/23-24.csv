Decisions to include this information into personalization of search or access to law enforcement is not a technical decision and it is something that will be considered in the future after the feature has been broadly adopted. Similarly, any EULA or privacy terms are subject to change.<p>If you did not serve up this information to request even though you had access to it, your company WOULD be breaking the law - this has already been settled in court. It is my conclusion that, as law abiding citizens and company, you would serve such requests. I also tangentially believe that if you felt the information would be useful to create a better product (and/or make more money) you would do this, as you are also compelled by law to maximize profit for shareholders and are incentivized do so to by financial compensation. I see no reason why your company would break the law to restrict the scope of this feature.<p>Furthermore, I can not tell where it says on the privacy policy that you do not or will not use this information for personalization of search or in response to compulsion of law. I saw a mention in the privacy policy of the compression proxy, but nothing relevant to Google not using the information or being able to provide it to a third party upon compulsion. Could you point me to that?",1430092783

Arguably, it is hard to justify the cost of $200k price tag + $200k opportunity cost for a top-tier university, and come out with a $40-60k/year job. But college isn&#x27;t just about crafting yourself to a job market. You get to truly explore who you are with a diverse group of people (race, genders, sexualities, culture, political leanings, economic backgrounds, drug habits) near your age, all while having access to all the knowledge of the world (be it religion, history, art, economics, etc).<p>Is the SJW culture of thought police hurting what makes college awesome? Yes. Is there a huge bloat of administrators that drives up the cost of college education? Yes. Are certain humanities departments misleading students into thinking that they can get a job with their degree? Yes. Do less-social students get less out of college? Yes.<p>But is college completely worthless? Of course not.",1430092781

One is how the projects are organized - they try t split the work up in a way where each team doesn&#x27;t know what the other teams are working on. But of course everyone knows what&#x27;s going on, yet you still have to deal with multi-week feedback loops where you submit your work, begin working in the next step, then find out 4 weeks later that the cognitive psychologist rejected your u.i....<p>(This style of working arose because the French used their u.s. Grad students in the 70s to assess all u.s. Military comps I projects)<p>The second reason I stop working with them each time is the general creepiness of the people involved.

Parties with Saudi princes and Cuban cigars they fly to the u.s. On their private jets, partying all night with Persian beauties, lots of drinking with mil Intel guys).<p>And my final reason is the constant pressure to work on offensive projects. I&#x27;ve only worked on defensive projects (reducing friendly fire, intelligence, etc) and won&#x27;t work on weapon systems.<p>I know I rambled here.

This can be an extreme hassle if you need to renew an SSL cert in a hurry, like it expired without you knowing, now you need to jump through tons of hoops (paper work, faxing, phone calls, etc). Your end users will not notice this, security is the same, so I would suggest going with a cheaper domain validation option.

Thanks to Obamacare your medical history doesn&#x27;t matter anymore. I purchase my own insurance and only three things matter:<p><pre><code>   your age\n\n   your gender\n\n   the type of coverage (bronze, silver, gold, etc)\n</code></pre>\nIt doesn&#x27;t even matter whether you&#x27;re single or married or have kids. My family policy cost is exactly the sum of:<p><pre><code>   my policy cost based on age and gender\n\n   my wife&#x27;s policy cost based on age and gender\n\n   each of my children&#x27;s policy costs (I don&#x27;t\n   remember if age or gender matter, I don&#x27;t think\n   they do)\n</code></pre>\nI generally don&#x27;t like the idea of Obamacare, but in this case it did a lot of good. Before Obamacare, insurance companies went out of their way to simply not offer private coverage <i>at all</i> to people with any medical issues, even minor ones. They can&#x27;t do that anymore.",1430090406

Of course no mainstream programming language supports dependent types, but it&#x27;s worth pointing out that in principle a type can encode any property checked by a unit test. Actually, dependent types are strictly more powerful, since you can prove undecidable properties which can&#x27;t be checked by unit tests (e.g., that a function does the right thing for all possible inputs).",1430090303

Thanks to what seems to have been bad/late professional advice, they missed one of the deadlines for taking things further and consequently that formal process terminated.<p>Around that time, they started taking professional advice from a different source and exploring their options, continuing to work for the employer in the meantime.<p>They subsequently concluded that the job was beyond hope and resigned, IIRC a couple of months later, and lawyers started exchanging letters to try and avoid formal action. As I understand it, just about <i>the first thing</i> the former employer&#x27;s lawyers did was point out that the former employee had remained in the job for a considerable time after the end of the formal grievance process without (as far as the employer was concerned) taking any further action. They argued this was sufficient evidence that no problems serious enough to be considered constructive dismissal remained at that time, and as it turned out, that was effectively game over.<p>(This matter never went to formal action. Reportedly the advice given to the former employee at that point was that their former employer had a decent chance of winning on that basis, and even if they lost it would cause a lot of time and stress to pursue the matter to its full conclusion with limited benefit likely to result.)<p>YMMV, if you need legal advice talk to a lawyer, etc. Just make sure you get better professional advice than this unfortunate person did, and get second opinions early if anyone advising you seems to be slow to respond or otherwise giving you less than their full support.",1430090003

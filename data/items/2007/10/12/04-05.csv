I am 100% positive all three names were there when i submitted the first time because we went over it a few times before hand. (I spent a few years as a video game tester so i noticed it was missing immediately) So maybe there is a problem with the app if these fields have consistent missing info.<p>I fixed the fields and resubmitted so hopefully the problem was corrected for me but just a heads up for YC. It might be worth looking into.",1192163242

But whether someone reads the text in the UI is not in general a measure of cluefulness. In fact smart people may be even less willing to read anything because they assume they don't need to.\n",1192163150

The notion that a word like fuck can make your brain curl up and cry like a toddler is so pathetically disturbing that it makes my skin crawl.

I already made it out a few times before but was recaptured. Armed with my greater yearning and experience I'm determined to make it out for good. Even if it does take another 20 attempts, I will willingly bloody myself on the corporate barbed wire fence that confines me. One day I will escape and spend my time roaming in the open green grass of fulfilling hard work, intellectual curiosity, and irreverent exploration. Oh yes, I will be free.",1192161993

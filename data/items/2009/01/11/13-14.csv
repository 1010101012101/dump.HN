A few weeks ago, I joined up with another start-up as a contractor for web-related work, and my work's been adequate, but nowhere near what I could do if I had full bandwidth.  I find myself dragging my feet because, perhaps I'm just working too much.<p>When is a project one too many?  Should I be more focused ona few specific things, or are there things you do to make sure you put 100% in all of your projects?<p>- Ben",1231681880

429127,comment,426594,427483,0,0,michael_nielsen,,,"That's a good point. I do think that when advice is very detailed and specific, it's more likely to be accurate.  When people are fooling themselves, or trying to fool their audience, with this kind of thing, they usually speak in generalities.  It's too much mental hard work to make up something very specific, like ""You should use vim or something like it"", followed by detailed reasons why that's a good idea; that, to me, has the ring of something Doctorow has thought about a good deal.  I'm _not_, of course, speaking of 'specifics' like the ""20 minute"" number he talks about; it's a detail, sure, but one that is very easy to make up.",1231681266

You can take a weekend trip to Cambodia or Vietnam and get a renewed visa when you come back. Or travel around SE Asia in general. You can do that indefinitely and it's quite cheap, even in relatively urban areas. Definitely cheaper than NYC(!)",1231681003

Doomsday has occurred and you are a survivor. While you are waiting for the spouse and kids to get home maybe you should do something practical. Like go down to the supermarket and lay in a bit of an extra stock.<p>You may notice that the little corner store has closed. If he has believed the rumor, he wants to save his stock. And besides, your money may not be worth anything tomorrow. You thought you had seen rapid inflation before but this is like from zero to a million in sixty seconds.<p>At the supermarket, if you are early enough, you will find pandemonium. If not, you will find practically nothing. Maybe a large bag of dog food (take it) and some cans of floor wax (forget it). The rest of the stuff was all in those carts that you met come flying up the walk as you came running down.<p>There won't be any girls at the cash registers, (they have done their shopping and gone). Besides, the cash registers aren't working anyhow, with no power. It may have taken the hired manager a little longer to figure out that he should grab what he can and head home to his family, but he has probably gone now.

1302725,comment,1301852,1302308,0,0,enjo,,,"I totally agree. As a matter of fact I live in a neighborhood that <i></i>IS<i></i> a suburb. It's one of the original 'streetcar suburbs' in Denver.<p>The big differences:<p>* houses align to the city grid (well a city grid, Denver actually has two.. it's complicated;) ). This is really important as the grid is far more friendly for pedestrian access.
* mixed use: There are integrated retail spots throughout the neighborhood. I don't have to leave the confines of my neighborhood to take care of almost anything
* Ready access to transit. I have a bus stop 2 bloycks away
* Proximity : I'm about 2 miles out of Downtown.<p>I still have a house (albeit much smaller than out in the burbs). I have two dogs. I have a yard. So in many ways I have the same trappings as those houses farther out, just less space.<p>Really when we talk abut 'suburbs' we're talking about 'exurbs' or extra urban areas.<p>That said, it can be very difficult to get this right. Here in Denver our old Airport gave way to a 'new urban' development called Stapleton. To me it's an absolute tragedy. The planners took 'walkable' to mean, quite literally, 'able to easily walked'. They forgot that you have to actually have things to walk TO. They built a neighborhood that sort of mashes up the two concepts. The houses are on the grid (for the most part), but the retail centers are highly zoned off. So they failed to actually integrate the retail into the neighborhood itself. They sit on the edges of the development. It has nice wide sidewalks and a really big park, but most people live at a pretty good distance.<p>So the results are mixed. You do get a lot of leisure walking going on. On a day like today (almost 80 degrees and sunny) you'll see a lot of folks out and about pushing strollers and the like. However, most people find themselves packing up the car when they want to eat or go to the grocery store.<p>Contrast that with my neighborhood where half the streets don't have sidewalks that go all the way through. Yet it's highly trafficked all day and well into the evening simply because we have lots of places worth walking to.<p>note: As you can tell, this is one of most favorite topics to absolutely geek out about:)",1272488375

They're now a major player in the mobile devices market, overnight.<p>Palm has current relationships with the three biggest American cell carriers, plus channels in Canada, France, Germany, UK, and Mexico.  Palm also has an extensive patent portfolio, many of which Apple is infringing upon.<p>However, the real prize is WebOS.  I just got back from Palm's Developer Day, and their technology stack for their next OS version is pretty damn neat.  It's a high performance event-driven javascript architecture on the back end, with WebKit on the front, all programmed through a Rails-ish MVC model.  As a web developer, it looks shockingly easy to program for.<p>Of course, if you want to program the phone in raw C/C++ and SDL, you can do that too.  It's incredibly flexible.<p>What Palm has been lacking is cash and time.  The WebOS development stack won't be fully built out until Fall, and they haven't had the resources to push new phone models out as quickly as they need.  This deal gives Palm much needed juice, and gives HP all the things they need to go head-to-head with Apple.<p>If HP is smart, they'll start tossing WebOS on tablets as soon as they can.  I'd buy an HP slate with WebOS in a heartbeat.",1272488179

The problem with sexual contact between an adult and a child is that one can never be sure that the child wasn't coerced in some way. However, that does not make the inverse true, that every instance of sexual contact between an adult and a child is subject to (implicit) abuse of power.<p>It seems to me that Moeller was making a subtle point that I have also made in discussions about the subject: that it is perfectly possible to imagine a situation where sexual contact between an child and an adult takes place with mutual consent and without coercion. One can imagine a 12 year old seducing a 30 year old neighbor, without either of them being harmed by the experience.

Everything I’m doing is on the web, so it would be great to hire firms who ‘get it’ in this arena: drafting terms of service specifically for websites, accounting for revenue earned from subscription-based web services and the sales tax implications of selling retail goods online, issuing equity in exchange for outside investment capital down the road, etc.<p>I don’t want to pay through my nose for firms with a lot of overhead (art on the walls, $1,500 flower arrangements in the reception area) and that are going to have inexperienced associates doing all the work, but I definitely want firms that will be the right fit even if they’re not the cheapest. I set up my previous business in Hawaii myself, but since my business in NYC is for the long-term I want to make sure it’s done right to set the stage for future things to come. Perhaps most important to me is a firm that actually listens to what I’m trying to do and is really excited about helping me build my business, and is interested in bringing their experience to bear as a problem solver; rather than just nodding their heads, whipping out some mediocre boilerplate documents without really thinking about my goals, and sending me on my way. In my previous business I didn’t provide that kind of half-assed service to my clients, and I’d like a lawyer and accountant who have the same kind of pride in the service they provide.<p>We hear so much about NYC as the next startup scene, so it would really be great to get actual names and first-hand recommendations from people who are here. Of course, we’ve all heard of Wilson Sonsini and the like, but I’d really like to investigate my options. Are there any resources like wikis for NYC entrepreneurs that consolidate all this kind of information in one place? Kind of like a NYC start up guide for startups. If not and people have lots of good suggestions here I’ll see about setting something like that up.<p>Thanks for reading!",1272486019

Side note: it works better with OS 10.5, because there it doesn't try to sync everything and it really does work. It works as bad as I said only on 10.6 (all minor versions tested - I kept hoping the darn Nickname sync issue would go away at some point release).<p>I do admit that the Spanning Sync trial I used once may have done something to my Google Contacts at one point when I checked that it shouldn't sync Suggested Contacts, but I don't see why Google would let such a thing made via the API stick forever.

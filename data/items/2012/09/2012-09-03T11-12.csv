There is no intrinsic quality that a language has if that quality can not be measured in some way.<p>A ""better quality"" language that does not account for it in more useful programs being written in it, is like a ""good man"" that never did any good deeds. Even if in some mystical, esoteric way, it was true, it would be of no consequence. Only what has actual consequence in the outside world matters in engineering (and programming).<p>(I didn't wrote ""in more better programs being written in it"" because that would be a vicious circle).",1346673583

4470059,comment,4468731,4469909,3,0,jhuni,,,"> Using ""let"" for this in Clojure results in nested and realatively less readable code.<p>Why would you have to have nested code? Why can't you just do this:<p><pre><code>  (let [a foo, b bar, c (combine foo bar)])
</code></pre>
> Are macros such a nice feature that they justify S-expressions?<p>I'd say S-expressions are the nicest looking syntax, which justifies them regardless of their considerable practical advantages. The only reason you might think that need to be ""justified"" is that you are still to used to C syntax. Try using S-expressions for a few years first to get used to them.<p>> When working on non-trivial projects, I find static typing and OOP really useful.<p>Again, I think you are just used to mainstream static OOP languages like Java and C++. If you try Clojure for long enough you can get used to its way of programming, which is arguably nicer then the mainstream static OOP way.",1346673377

4470048,comment,4467653,4468613,1,0,batista,,,"><i>Carbon -> Cocoa was a massive change. So was PPC -> x86.</i><p>1) Both were necessary. Carbon was a stop-gap port of the old Mac way and incompatible with the OS X design, and the x86 transition had to be made because the PPC mobile roadmap was late (and bad). It was not a ""let's break API compatibility because we came with a cool new idea"" or ""because the old maintainer got bored and the new one has different ideas"", which often happens in Gnome/Linux land.<p>2) Not to mention that the Carbon->Cocoa took like 7+ years to be made full (Carbon apps actually still run on modern OS X), and Apple went to the effort to provide a full bundled compatibility layer for PPC for many years (Rosetta), plus ""fat binaries"" to make the switch easier. I.e nothing like the ""let's break stuff to make them better and let them deal with it"" attitude in the Gnome world.<p>3) Also: Apple remade the old stuff ITSELF each time, with paid developers working on the OS X, bundled userland and Apple pro apps to port them, whereas Gnome changes made lots of developers walk away from the free, OS, Gnome apps.<p>4) Plus: Apple had a lot of market share (compared to Linux) to force companies like Adobe, Microsoft et al, to port their stuff along eventually. Gnome did not have that benefit.<p>So, not at all the same, and no, it's far more than ""Apple conditioning developers to expect change"".",1346673115

4470042,comment,4468037,4469929,2,0,hatcravat,,,"You obviously haven't traveled internationally very much or you are being deliberately obtuse (or both).<p>I'll explain anyway: Many countries have some sort of passport control both when you enter and when you leave the country.  The reasons for this are varied, but a common one is to make sure you didn't overstay your visa.  As a result, you need to have a valid visa attached to your passport to pass through passportcontrol to exit the country.  It is almost never sufficient to have been issued a visa to pass through passport control.  You almost always need the one physical piece of paper that is the physical manifestation of the visa.<p>If your employer has your passport, they also have the visa which was stapled to it. Your embassy can easily get you a replacement passport, but a replacement visa is up to the host country.<p>Your two options to leave are: 
1) Ask your former employer for your passport and visa.
2) Go through some (or a lot, to judge from the other comments) bureaucracy to get a new visa.",1346672936

With real-time search, a latency of 30 seconds is acceptable, since you aren't going to know when the tweet was posted in the first place. With GChat, it has to be immediate, because it's frequently used in the context of someone verbally saying ""I'll ping you this link"" and it's kinda embarrassing if the link doesn't arrive for 30 seconds.</i><p>Yes, so that's one use case for one architecture (low latency message queue), and the other is another.

The approaches for scaling eBay are completely different than for scaling Reddit or YouTube, because eBay can't afford eventual consistency.</i><p>My list wasn't supposed to be exhaustive -- I spoke of 4-5 common styles and only mention 2.

I can tell you that they do not all use something like the notions behind Google AppEngine.</i><p>I don't think we mean the same things. For one, nobody makes search engines, or a google competitor. So what it takes to do Google Search is a moot point, when discussing common architectural patterns behind big sites.<p>I meant high level stuff on on hand like demoralised data, map reduce, workers, share nothing, sharding and such, and common infrastructure on the other hand, like the relational db, memcached, big-table like datastore, abstract filesystem (S3, BlobStore, GridFS, etc), ElasticSearch, Hadoop, Node, Redis, message queues, etc.<p>Google Search or Facebook might have needs way beyond those, but the above are shared by 99% of big sites out there.<p>A common system to build on top of them that is higher level than Heroku (and more expansive and accommodating than GAE) should exist, and it would cater more than 80% of big website needs.

Smarkets is disrupting the global betting industry by offering a modern betting exchange platform with significantly lower transaction fees than the competition. We have traded over 150 million of bets since launching in February 2010.<p>The part of our stack which runs behind the website is one of the few that uses Erlang as a primary language, and is supported by other well-known Erlang projects such as RabbitMQ and CouchDB.<p>The non-Erlang pieces of our stack are mostly written in Python, and relies heavily on asynchronous programming techniques and REST. We use the following technologies: VirtualBox, Vagrant, Flask, gunicorn, PostgreSQL, Ganglia, Icinga, Graphite, Cacti, Jenkins, Trac, Git and many other open source packages.<p>We are well-funded and growing quickly so are looking for Python and Erlang engineers to join our team.
If you are looking for a flexible, agile team to work with; want to work somewhere free of big corporate politics; would like a cool project to work on; wed love to hear from you!

You&#x27;ll probably get better results from him/her than the CEO, since their job is specifically to address these issues and in a decent organization will be given the autonomy to do so (no guarantees here!).<p>It&#x27;s not clear to be that LSU is responsible for anything more than shitty security.  It&#x27;s possible that they told the newspaper lies, but it&#x27;s also possible that they told them the truth and that the newspaper misreported.  I think reporting them for a HIPAA retaliation may have been premature, unless you know more about this situation than you wrote on your site (as opposed to reporting a HIPAA violation, which this clearly is).<p>But best of luck going after the newspapers.  I&#x27;m getting sick of these &quot;journalists&quot; making up lies about the central figures in their stories without bothering to even check with them first to get their side of the story.<p>EDIT: Aaand, apparently, neither publication has an ombudsman, which tells you a lot already.

Rather, I&#x27;m guessing the message that got out of the IT department was &quot;we got hacked by a professor&quot;, which then likely mutated via the rumor mill into the details about a class demonstration.<p>If anything, I think this shows the hospital gave the professor a lot more benefit of the doubt than I would have expected.<p>The professor did himself no favors with his email:<p><pre><code>    I am Sam Bowne, an instructor at City College\n    San Francisco, and I found two security problems\n    on your server with a Google search.\n\n    Your FTP server has been compromised, and some\n    files named &quot;w0000000t&quot; were added to it.\n</code></pre>\nIf I&#x27;m the IT administrator who receives this message, then after reading the first two sentences, I&#x27;ve already jumped to the conclusion that <i>this professor</i> is the individual who compromised my server! &quot;Hi, I found security issues with your server, and now it&#x27;s compromised!&quot;<p>Sure, once you&#x27;ve read the intro by the professor, the meaning is clear, but think of yourself as a sysadmin getting this email, without the context of &quot;I just found this, I had nothing to do with it&quot; in your brain, and how are you going to react?

8249076,comment,8246760,8249027,1,0,ThomPete,,,"I agree that Denmark don&#x27;t scale. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that the current system we have in the US is good or that the insurance based version is by any metrics the best possible solution for the US. You could also think in states instead.<p>If you look at it from a purely financial point of view the problem of the US system is that when given the choice, younger people don&#x27;t insure themselves because they are healthy and so don&#x27;t participate in financing those who are sick by costing the system less.<p>As they grow older and get sicker they end up paying insane prices unless they are paid by employees and even there the quality of the insurance varies and you still have some really absurd pre-existing conditions rules etc. If you don&#x27;t have an employer to back you up you are basically screwed.<p>Obama Care is an attempt at solving this issue. It&#x27;s not single payer but it&#x27;s closer and hopefully it will help improving the healthcare system for millions of those without either healthcare or proper healthcare.<p>Now in my mind there is a middle ground where you pay most of your healthcare yourself (the checkups, the sinus infection etc) but you don&#x27;t end up in endless debt because you become sick, your kid gets born to early and have to stay at a neonathal facility, for a longer period of time and don&#x27;t have the right insurance.<p>And having been through the system I must say that if people think it&#x27;s less beucratic than say they Danish system (which is much more social in its approach) then they would be mistaken. The sheer number of interests involved in any single episode creates complexity way beyond what seems reasonable.<p>So agree it&#x27;s not possible to take a small nation and apply what they do, but it is possible to look at the current system and realize that the healthcare system in the US is def not a feature but rather a system with plenty of room for improvement.",1409485771

8249071,comment,8246760,8249051,2,0,jval,,,"Politics is all about the money. Obviously administration is worse at scale too, but it comes down to political will in having the money to do it.<p>The way you keep a political union together without having it break apart is by limiting the amount of things the members of the union have to share. If you start taxing rich states and funnelling the money over to poor states, you give people a reason to want to break out of the union. Ultimately people only stay if they&#x27;re getting a good deal.<p>Taxpayers in New York will definitely be happy if their money goes into the military, as having a New York rather than a US military wouldn&#x27;t work. But to have all their money go into universal healthcare in Idaho would just piss them off, because people in Idaho can pay for that themselves. That&#x27;s why healthcare is largely a state matter in the US - you&#x27;ll find some states have great healthcare, others don&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m not saying the US can&#x27;t do it better (they clearly can), I&#x27;m just saying comparisons with other countries are useless because they don&#x27;t take into account the unique political realities of the United States.",1409485618

Even still, this only reduces your serving costs while you still would be paying the commission, which to me seems like the higher of the two costs.<p>To answer your question about handling the serving of ads yourself, there are several options out there. Probably one of the best known for a managed solution is OpenX (<a href=""http://openx.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openx.com</a>). On the other hand there is Revive Adserver (<a href=""http://revive-adserver.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://revive-adserver.com</a>) which is self-hosted and is actually the open source version of OpenX.<p>One caveat of running your own server though will be that you are responsible for your own inventory on the site. You can always fill any remaining inventory with Google Adsense or similar though. Long-story short, I would say unless you have substantial traffic to your site and are making significant money through ads on your site it is most likely not worth the hassle. If, on the other hand, your site has high enough traffic and your current ads are well targeted and have a high action rate for the advertiser you may be able to start selling your own ad space or find a better ad provider with better terms.",1409485070

8249057,comment,8245942,8247533,1,0,klibertp,,,"I tried to extend Komodo IDE back when I used it heavily. I had no knowledge of Firefox internals then.<p>The biggest problem I had with this was the lack of documentation and a sane development environment. Working in an embedded environment makes debugging (and exploratory programming) much harder: you can&#x27;t just `print` your way through APIs and things. You can&#x27;t use `pdb`, much less graphical debuggers. This makes developing such extensions painful: you need to learn a whole lot of APIs at once and memorize them before writing even one line of code.<p>Emacs is better on both accounts. The &quot;self-documenting&quot; part means that there are rich docstrings for every single function you&#x27;d want to invoke and that you have many supporting tools for discovering APIs (like apropos). There&#x27;s a <i>Messages</i> buffer which functions as a stdout, where you can dump whatever you need to see at any point. You can also immediately see the source of any function, even if it&#x27;s implemented in C. And you have a graphical debugger for Elisp if you need it.<p>Emacs is a really nice development platform for Elisp and accidentally for other languages.

You can socialise and centralise healthcare in countries on such a small scale, but it becomes exponentially more difficult to do in a country like the US (pop: 313 M).<p>The United States is an enormous country comprised of 50 separate state governments, where the powers of the federal government are extremely limited (both by the constitution itself, and by the fact that it is practically impossible to do anything at that kind of scale).<p>As a result, it is extremely hard to pass any sort of massive reforms.

There&#x27;s already plenty of snakeoil out there claiming to erase ciphertext or keys anyway - with zero verifiability, and often the claims have been demonstrably false. I could name two right off the bat: Snapchat. Cryptolocker.<p>If you want ephemeral communications, GPG actually <i>won&#x27;t</i> do the trick, the public encryption asymmetric subkeys are pretty long-term; ephemeral communications have key lifespans measured in seconds, not months or years. The closest you can get to what you want right now is probably Axolotl as used by TextSecure/Signal, or perhaps OTR, or perhaps Pond: good designs try to not to need to trust third-parties to destroy things and try to instead make sure third-parties don&#x27;t see things that are too useful to Eve or Mallory in the future. (Even there, metadata is still a nightmarish concern which is hard to protect and very valuable to Eve, sometimes moreso than content.)<p>Even trusting the <i>first</i> or <i>second</i> party to clear things, you may have some problems. Did you <i>really</i> clear that memory? Are you <i>certain</i> the compiler didn&#x27;t &#x27;helpfully&#x27; optimise out your memset? (See also: explicit_bzero(), etc.) Did Bob secretly take a copy, or can you trust him not to? (You pretty much <i>have</i> to trust Bob to follow the protocol there; that is the impossible problem behind DRM! If Bob wants to cheat, he&#x27;s got physical access and all the time in the world: he always wins.) And if Bob is honest, if jackboots bust down Bob&#x27;s door, does Alice still have to worry about a cold-boot attack? (Probably, yes.) Or Mallory playing really dirty and rooting Alice or Bob&#x27;s machine, which is always, possibly short of the $5 wrench/rubber-hose attack, the easiest route. (See also: Firewire and Thunderbolt DMA attacks, exploitable USB stack bugs, etc.)<p>It&#x27;s <i>possible</i> to try to do trusted ICs with tamper-resistant low-retention EEPROM storage, such as you might find on a specialised smartcard/crypto token or TPM - Pond tries to use a TPM&#x27;s key storage if one&#x27;s available, I think? - but these devices are often black boxes with far too little external auditing from the good guys and it is something of a blind spot to prove it is above tampering. (There are a couple of open-source efforts to develop trusted cryptography/security cores, including <a href=""https://cryptech.is/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cryptech.is/</a> for example, but verification that <i>hardware</i> objects came from sources and weren&#x27;t trojaned even as low as at the gate doping level is Very Hard™!; much harder than deterministic assembly/compilation for software.) They may be trust<i>ed</i> by some, but they have a long way to go to be trust<i>worthy</i>.<p>Rolling along with a pretty website is lovely, but doesn&#x27;t help with <i>any</i> of these problems. Worse, it may give people a false sense of security. Please, no. The doghouse has enough dogs it in already.",1409482807

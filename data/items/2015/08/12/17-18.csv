If you&#x27;re starting out your career you&#x27;ve probably got about 40-50 years of saving followed by say 20 years of retirement, i.e. your training data is not much more than the period you&#x27;re trying to predict.<p>2. That history is primarily over the period of world history that can be summed up as &quot;cheap oil&quot;. Personally I wouldn&#x27;t use it to predict any other time period.<p>3. If you look at the returns over time, they&#x27;re pretty much generational. Some generations get fantastic returns from the stock market, while others at best are keeping up with inflation. If you started investing in say 2000 you probably know which category you&#x27;re in.",1439402357

The reality of the situation is that if anybody with criminal intent wants to attack the Bitcoin network you need exactly two IP addresses (one v4, one v6) to completely disable all new incoming connections on all nodes in the network. This patch doesn&#x27;t change that fact, nor that criminals often have botnets with unlimited access to new IP addresses every second of the day.<p>It doesn&#x27;t achieve the stated design goal, and introduces new vulnerabilities which aren&#x27;t stated in the commit.<p>> <i>All of his other proposals are just that, proposals and &quot;lets talk about this and the problem&quot;.

Operating on a fork of the software with soft consensus changes or simply operational changes that do not affect consensus are completely fine, that happens today under the assumption that you are somewhat at risk if you run software that is even slightly different to anybody elses. Some nodes in the network for example support different P2P commands, and that&#x27;s fine because the P2P network is not part of the consensus at all. The linked discussions are mostly harmless, it is extremely positive that all scenarios and eventualities are debated out in the open.<p>Prompting companies and individuals to attempt a hard fork of the network without consensus is another matter entirely.

But with the way incentives are currently structured, it&#x27;s better for any individual miner to produce an empty block that propagates faster.  Or in other words, to process transactions as slowly as possible.<p>There&#x27;s two ways you can fix the incentives.  One would be to kill the block reward.  You don&#x27;t process transactions, you don&#x27;t get any fees.  This would likely cause a massive increase in transaction fees if the network were to retain its current hashrate (and thus level of security).<p>The other way is to make a law, basically.  You&#x27;d need a hardfork that refuses to recognize any block that isn&#x27;t at least 75% full, but you keep the block reward and thus avoid blowing up transaction costs.  This has the problem that the network could &quot;stall out&quot; under the right conditions (no incoming transactions, gigabyte blocksize, etc).<p>Or instead of messing with incentives you can change the protocol itself - if everyone works on the same transaction set then all you really need is a fixed-size structure to propagate the winning hash, and there are no empty blocks unless there&#x27;s no incoming transactions.  Again, you&#x27;re talking a hardfork and this one would involve core changes to the Bitcoin protocol.",1439401687

Actually the S&P500 return since inception is about 10%, maybe he&#x27;s referencing it. But the real return of 1950 to 2010 or so has averaged about 7%. And that uses CPI numbers which may underestimate price increases, particularly in some areas.

HN users have found tens of bugs and helped stress test the platform. Our team took all bugs into account and worked with every HN member to resolve them.<p>New Linux Monitoring Agent<p>Since then, we have completely revamped our linux monitoring agent and coded it in Ruby on Rails, instead of Python. This was due to the fact that many users complained about the reliability of the monitoring agent and high number of false positive alerts. We worked hard to resolve this and we believe the new agent addresses that in the first place. You can now find CloudStats agent log and see what&#x27;s happening here: /var/log/cloudstats.log. New agent is able to securely update itself and once we add new features you will not need to upgrade agent at all.<p>RAM Buffers / Cached display<p>Many HN members asked us to not just display FREE and USED ram, but also wanted to see Buffers and Cache. It is true, that sometimes Linux RAM usage can be confusing for beginner server admins. So we have taken this into account and now you can see Free, Used, Buffered and Cached RAM separately on the server information page.<p>Once again, we would be grateful for any added feedback HN community may provide and we are providing totally free accounts for HN members of:<p>100 Server Monitors \n100 URL Monitors \n100 IP Ping Monitors<p>In return, we only ask you to share our website on your Twitter or Facebook.

Slow learners get extra time and teacher attention before trying to move on to more advanced topics.<p>Fast learners enjoy racing through subjects at their own top speed. It is extremely rewarding to be able to skip forward as soon as you are ready. This naturally develops self-managed education habits.<p>I got to learn this way for one year in elementary school and it was the best experience I have ever had in education.<p>To do this, teachers need organized lesson plans for each class that students can follow at their own pace, and act more as self-learning mentors and a learning resource, as apposed to controlling the pace with all-class lectures. The commonality between all classes is teachers are teaching kids how to learn by their own efforts, not just topics they will forget.",1439399765

This project on its kickstarter already displayed lots of art and wallpaper material, and they launched the game obviously with a soundtrack.<p>In short, shipping that is going to a local printer and asking to make a booklet or a wallpaper, in color. They give you a price and you inflate it by 10x. Wallpaper and booklet costs $3 to print, add a soundtrack and $3 in shipping (average, some will be 50c, some $5), and turn it into a +$25 reward. Get 1000 backers like that and you&#x27;re netting close to $20k for relatively little effort. Even some ridiculous overhead and you still net $10k for stuff you can pay a highschooler a few hundred bucks to create. That $20k can pay a 3man passionate noodle eating team that&#x27;s working on this parttime for months, and that&#x27;s with a thousand backers, this team had a few thousand, actually I took a look and it seems that rewards are about half their campaign. It&#x27;s really scrappy but it happens and it sometimes really works out.<p>Definitely not something that works for every project, in fact I see it fail more often than not. But it&#x27;s not a priori a bad idea, I just don&#x27;t think everyone thinks it through. Some devs create games and then have a mini comic booklet as a reward that increases the price by $5, or hell just include it for free because hey, kickstarter.

Google and Yahoo started as grad students’ projects.  Facebook was a project Zuckerberg built while he was a sophomore in college.  Twitter was a side project that started with a single engineer inside a company doing something totally different.  Airbnb was a side project to make some money to afford rent.  They all became companies later.<p>This is hardly a list of the best companies, and a few of them don&#x27;t support the argument:<p>1. The search/portal market was already significant when Google launched. Companies like Yahoo, Excite, Lycos were already public traded at the time, and were some of the hottest issues in the tech space. So it&#x27;s no wonder Andy Bechtolsheim cut Larry and Sergey a check for $100,000 before a corporate entity even existed.<p>2. When Facebook launched, Friendster already had millions of users and had received a $30 million acquisition offer from Google. MySpace, which was created by people who saw Friendster&#x27;s popularity, was founded by people trying to capitalize on the social networking hype that was already present in 2003.<p>3. Even Airbnb is hardly a post child for Sam&#x27;s argument. Homeaway, VRBO and Couchsurfing were all well established when Airbnb launched.<p>For most entrepreneurs, &quot;start out with an idea that doesn&#x27;t sound very good&quot; isn&#x27;t likely to turn out very good.",1439399712

10048973,comment,10047721,10048211,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Well I think people are getting the wrong impression here. They started this game in 2013 on their own money, got a subsidy to build a prototype that year, then in 2014 raised money from a loan in Belgium to finish the game. They communicated all of this in their Kickstarter. They then asked $50k I guess to finish up the game and expand the scope a little bit, and make some money on various rewards, but mainly I suppose as virtually all kickstarters nowadays: a presales platform.<p>In that regard they succeeded. The game is finished, it&#x27;s for sale, and the backers got their game.<p>But the sales were also disappointing, and so they declared bankruptcy.<p>The issue here is that they created stickers, dvd crap, soundtracks etc... Kickstarter backer rewards. And they can&#x27;t ship them as they&#x27;re bankrupt. The problem obviously is that they didn&#x27;t earmark funds ahead. I think that&#x27;s disrespectful towards the backers and it&#x27;s a genuine complaint, but I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s very significant in the scheme of things. Kickstarters know the risks. And the creators of the game put their heart and soul into it and ended up bankrupt, yet did deliver the game. I think that&#x27;s a fair compromise for the backers of the game, even if they don&#x27;t end up getting their rewards, like an artbook or wallpaper which can be pretty sweet but I doubt anyone will lose sleep over it, while the creators must&#x27;ve lost a lot of sleep going through a bankruptcy.<p>So this notion they raised $50k for 7 people to build a game in two months isn&#x27;t really the case at all. Beyond that, your point on merchandise rings true but it depends on context. A soundtrack, artbook and wallpaper usually isn&#x27;t a big deal. After all, the game has a soundtrack regardless, and they&#x27;d already produced tons of artwork in the process of modelling, you can see it on the kickstarter. The effort is printing and shipping it. But if someone is giving you a $20 premium to ship him a PDF you already have on your computer, would you say that&#x27;s bad business? Not really, any smart indie will pay some highschooler $250 to take care of it, a small price to increase your budget by $10k or something to that effect. The issue is that some kickstarters go way overboard, and the reward/effort ratio plummets to below their IRR or even below 1. So it really depends, in this case I think it wasn&#x27;t a bad decision as they promised rewards for things they already had laying around, they simply should&#x27;ve earmarked the funds.",1439398849

The American / Iraq war of 2003 had civilians on both sides.<p>I agree that all members of American and Japanese society share some level of responsibility for participating in total war, but I also think your &quot;no civilians&quot; statement goes too far. It is obvious that some members of a country have more direct effect on the war than others and that once you get far enough away (children are civilians, adults who do not work are civilians, workers who deliver mail are civilians, workers who make vehicle parts are probably civilians, workers who make tanks might be civilians, etc). To argue otherwise is to view war as some kind of &#x27;original sin,&#x27; where the level of your contribution is immaterial and any association is sufficient to make one a combatant. If that&#x27;s the case, then you and I and everyone alive today is certainly indicted in the many wars we are not working to stop. Even people working to stop one war are helping others to continue by not working to stop them. It&#x27;s absurd.<p>Civilians do start wars and, in the modern era, they are often held to account for the wars they start. War crimes tribunals indict military and civilian personnel alike. I also agree that young men bear an unequal and unjust burden in war - but the suggestion you make is silly. The solution is not to extend that unequal burden by allowing more people to be killed, but instead to give young men more options to avoid being killed and killing others.",1439398841

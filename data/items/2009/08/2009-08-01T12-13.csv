What's not important is correcting a term that was good enough for its intended purpose and derails an otherwise fruitful discussion into nitpicking about the meaning of words being used.<p>In this case I don't think it was really a big deal either way.  Discussion about the major 3rd in the video wasn't really harmed much, and a few mildly interesting posts about semantics resulted.",1249131564
736257,comment,736038,736133,0,0,tayssir,,,"I think this is too dismissive of other forms of revolution. I like Michael Albert's explanation of revolution, which is a fundamental change in at least one of a society's defining institutions.
<a href=""http://www.zmag.org/zspace/commentaries/2564"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zmag.org/zspace/commentaries/2564</a><p>From this perspective, the 1953 US overthrow of Iran's parliamentary democracy (to install a monarch) was a successful revolution. And even a revolution with the best of intentions (which obviously wasn't the case with the 1953 revolution) won't necessarily result in an improved society. To the contrary, society might even regress. If a revolution suddenly occurred right now in the US, since we US citizens haven't laid the groundwork of serious popular organizing and institutions, we might expect a form of fascism to probably result.",1249131487

736253,comment,736038,736038,0,0,quizbiz,,,"This past year, senior year of high school, my history teacher based his curriculum on teaching us how to stage a revolution. He asked us to plan a revolution of the school, consider what/who needs to be revolted against, and how. It was entertaining at first and it made learning the Russian Revolution, the revolution in Argentina, and others more relevant but my teacher seemed to be bent on the fact that we should actually revolt against our government as soon as possible. I consider(ed) it nonsense.<p>I'll try to stay away from a political debate and focus on the psychological argument. That Political revolution in the United States can be done within its current system, through election and democracy, and as bad as things are, there is no need for a cataclysmic shift. As I see it, democracy is evolutionary, it continuously evolves, checks and balances are self correcting just like natural selection. I'm all about learning practical stuff and I just don't see where this fits beyond in establishing a critical mindset.<p>Please broaden my mind.",1249130560

736247,comment,734380,734818,0,0,Goladus,,,"Without more context it's really impossible to say whether that was a major I or not.  It would be the only functional harmony in the entire pattern, so it seems unlikely it was a I.  A pentatonic melody by itself doesn't infer much in the way of harmonic progression.  The only reason we hear C# as tonic is because he starts there and emphasizes it with repetition and mini-cadences that are primarily rhythmic in nature.  There aren't any IV or V chords available with those pitches (or iii or vii for that matter, you can imply a ii but not very well).<p>I would actually argue that interval actually is the most accurate term in this case.  (Not that I didn't understand what was meant by the term ""chord"" though, and certainly wouldn't have been bothered by it)",1249130194

The years I spent without a TV were the most productive, and least lonely, of my life.  (Of course, those years were also before the advent of the web, so there was a lot less time online, as well, which may be a factor.)<p>As David Mamet put it, ""Everybody makes their own fun.

Think of the changes between the middle age and now... there's so much room to do much better... At a bigger scale, for me, the next point is introducing more participative democracy in companies, especially big companies (they are truly the most prominent fascist-like organisations there...)",1249128066

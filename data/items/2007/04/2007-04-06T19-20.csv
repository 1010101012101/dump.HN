Actually, I think all the visits in our logs can be traced back to a cofounder.  Which makes sense, as we haven't given out our URL to anyone but yCombinator.<p>I'd actually be a little disappointed if they had looked at our demo, because it's rather disappointing.  We've been doing a bunch of cleanup work so far this Good Friday, and will likely be replacing our mockup layout with an approximation of the real thing over the weekend.  So I'd be grateful for a few extra days...",1175889200

9691,comment,9661,9661,0,0,pg,,,"Oddly enough, I can't tell.  It seems to be a portrait expressed in terms of the broken reinventions of the Lisp wheel that currently occupy the median programmer's head.  Sort of like describing a car as a ""horseless carriage.""  But since I don't know those reinventions well, I can't say if this is an accurate portrait.<p>For example, someone recently told me that in Python you can't have conditionals within math expressions.  E.g. you can say the equiv of<p>(if foo (+ x 1) (+ x 2))<p>but not<p>(+ x (if foo 1 2))<p>To me this just seems gratuitously restrictive. But I 
suppose it would at least be an accurate, if rather long,
description of Lisp to teach people Python, and then say
e.g. ""Ok, now imagine if you could also just put any
expression anywhere.""  Plus a few other things, of course...",1175888934

9682,comment,9369,9416,0,0,bls,,,"You are a victim of YC's marketing. First of all, if you don't need their money, don't sell part of your company to them. And, if you do need their money, don't make it so obvious or you'll have no room to negotiate the equity you are selling them: people keep saying $15,000 for 6% but those are just averages--the equity range I have heard about was 1.5%-12%. I think you would be a 12%-er for sure.<p>If I had a good idea that I believed in, I would go to my friends and family and ask them to loan me $2,000 a month for eight months. If I succeeded, I would pay them back their money + interest + whatever I felt like giving them as a gift. If I failed, I would get a real job and pay them back in a few months time.",1175887788

9680,comment,9625,9668,0,0,e1ven,,,"I have nothing against adding features that make sense, and are refinements of the workflow.<p>Adding a comfortable pad to a pencil makes it easier to use, and is certainly worth a bit extra to people. Adding replaceable erasers adds more, and so on.<p>Those are potentially useful features, and they don't get in the way of people using the pencil. <p>This is the sort of refining that should always go on. How can we make things easier for our users. How can we streamline their workflow.<p>Part of the problem in adding feature comes when you start adding features which make the base case harder. When users start to look at the vast sums of things that CAN be done, and you lose the simplicity of the tool. <p>Another problem is that adding features allows people to hack things, in ways that are more complex than they should be, and cause user-frustration.<p>Let me give you an example-<p>There was a small company I knew that kept its data in a series of excel files. They were small, and it was a quick and easy to keep track of what they were doing.<p>As the company started to grow, they started needing more and more complex reports on the data, and were running into the limitations of what they could easily do.<p>They started working with heavy scripting in Excel, using VBA scripts to copy data from one sheet to another, and to replicate it to backup excel files.<p>Eventually they had a mess of files talking to one another,  doing CSV exports, then parsing them and creating new files, and the like. It worked.. Kinda.. But it was kludgey, and complex.<p>
The problem was that they kept adding new features to their excel documents, rather than accepting that excel was Great at what it did [1], but it wasn't the right solution for them any more.<p>Eventually, if I recall, they finally got it all moved over to a series of Access databases, which made things a lot nicer.<p>Could Microsoft add features to Excel to make it easier for them to keep pushing it? Sure.. <p>Should they? In this case, probably not. The features you adding need to make sense for the tool.<p><p><p>[1] For the sake of discussion, anyway ;)",1175887678

9671,comment,8863,8863,0,0,bls,,,"This is an interesting application. But, your demo video does not do it justice: (a) It is too long; (b) your folders that you use in the video have too many files in them; you say about 10x more words than necessary; and (d) your voice, combined with the bad microphone input, make the explanation sounds pad.<p>Your main competition is not USB drives: it is HotMail, GMail, and Yahoo! Mail. Once people are taught the ""email it to yourself"" trick, they love to use it--I think because it is not so intuitive for people, yet it is so simple, that they are proud that they are doing something so clever.

9670,comment,9577,9577,0,0,rebecca_d,,,"The evolution of the Internet is constantly being challenged by creationists-Its sort of brilliant marketing (Komisar) to act as though as of your investees has a great idea it warrants another web phase (3.0?). True, no product campaign these days is complete without a rebranding of the web itself. <p>As advertising has undergone a power shift, from the content providers to the users, advertising has somehow become a bad word. Now that end users decide what and how products will be pitched, advertising seems to stand not only for traditional, flashy, in-your-face ads, but for any product communication that has already occurred. In that sense,  advertising is perpetually over, and therefore always omnipresent.  <p>Simply put, as more and more people research products and services online, making purchasing decisions online, and actually buy online, it seems preposterous to claim that advertising, and companies that are in the business of advertising, are in anyway passe. It is inconsistent with the evolution of the web. <p>What I like about Komisar-backed Aggregate Knowledge is that it is creating the platform for some wonderful advertising streams. Right now, as I understand it, they are touting as part of their product targeting by the Psychology of Crowds, or the beginning of building psychological profiles of buyers. This is done on many shopping sites: If person 1 buys product A, then he will, based on group research, be interested in product B and product C and should be presented with B and C in a non-obtrusive fashion.  
What this should naturally evolve into is a better targeting-being able to differentiate between types of buyers; is she an impulse buyer that might be wooed by a flashy interface, or is she a research shopper, who needs a case study to buy? Merely providing relevant content, without the proper packaging for the individual (what I think to be the advertising formerly know as advertising) is deficient.   
Also, what is the ideal interface complexity of this shopper? For instance, in person people buy less in big stores because they are overwhelmed by the sheer number of options. They are more likely to buy products in a smaller store. People are more influenced by items placed at the front of the store as their shopping goals are more malleable as they enter. Not to say that these findings will translate directly to shopping behavior on the web, but we will soon have the ability to create the perfect shopping environment for an individual, and advertising will be big part of it.

In addition, unless Libland's government had irrationally incited Xia's actions (theoretically, an unlikely choice for a free society), other states would see this a flagrant attack on Libland and come to its aid.<p>The example is certainly viable for a case where one state (out of over 200 in the real world) has a monopoly on producing any essential good, or where Xia's military is more powerful than the combined strength of all potential opposing states.

429305,comment,399863,399863,0,0,IgorG,,,"I think this is an excellent, well-observed piece.  Credentials mattered more at a time when the measurement of effective results took longer to read so that university degrees and performance badges were indicators of the probability of future success.  However, the modern age is an accelerated age and turn over of results based on performance is almost immediate.  Companies have to be able to make much quicker, adaptive decisions than ever before; it's like everything is in a state of constant crisis management.  Obviously the younger and leaner the company, the less baggage its accumulated and the more nimble it can be, but not always.\nLarger enterprises that adapt with more localised, distributed structures are able to operate and respond as smaller units but still maintaining the strength of size.\nAnything that is more based on measured results is going to be better as long as the means of measurement are also measured.",1231694151
429304,comment,428554,428927,0,0,yef,,,"Let's get one thing out of the way, first: the simple fact that you can <i>compare</i> Ubuntu (cost: $0) with OSX ($120 + custom hardware) and Windows ($117) is <i>utterly amazing</i>.<p>You make a valid point that certain things break and take coaxing and searching message boards to work. That's definitely bad.<p>The point I would question is that of the UI. There are many aspects of OSX that are weird -- the mouse tracking, installing applications, setting a background color for your desktop, bringing up a terminal. Other issues exist for Windows. I can see how it's hard to detach yourself from something you're used to, though.<p>Those are going to be the two main issues in getting Ubuntu off the ground with average users. Having shit not break, and being close enough to users' existing habits to make the switch easy.<p>My hunch is that things are pretty close to where they'll end up. Linux will be an attractive alternative among techies, hobbyists, and average folks with spare/old machines. Microsoft and Apple will respond by cutting prices, and in the end, won't lose a substantial share of the market to Linux on the desktop, but suffer decreased margins. The user wins.",1231694122

This feeds into #2:<p>Second, until the libertarian party actually puts together a platform, they aren't a real party.  The reason's simple: first, nobody can tell what they're really voting for in terms of deltas to the legal codebase, and second, without going in with a plan, I don't think we'd even get the libertarians to agree with each other for doing anything.<p>To sum it up, I haven't seen a political party that's taken a real stance, but would rather sit on the sidelines and throw stones.  Call me when you have a platform, not rhetoric.  I don't want argument, I spent 11 years in a college town -- I've done it to death, I want actual proposals that I can personally evaluate.

For example, here's what Piet Hut, now a professor of physics at the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton, writes about his experiences with classical mechanics as an undergraduate  in his review of SICM available at\n<a href=""http://www.ids.ias.edu/~piet/publ/other/sicm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ids.ias.edu/~piet/publ/other/sicm.html</a> :<p>""Soon I went through the library in search of books on the variational principle in classical mechanics. I found several heavy tomes, borrowed them all, and started on the one that looked most attractive. Alas, it didn't take long for me to realize that there was quite a bit of hand-waving involved. There was no clear definition of the procedure used for computing path integrals, let alone for the operations of differentiating them in various ways, by using partial derivatives and/or using an ordinary derivative along a particular path. And when and why the end points of the various paths had to be considered fixed or open to variation also was unclear, contributing to the overall confusion.<p>Working through the canned exercises was not very difficult, and from an instrumental point of view, my book was quite clear, as long as the reader would stick to simple examples. But the ambiguity of the presentation frustrated me, and I started scanning through other, even more detailed books. Alas, nowhere did I find the clarity that I desired, and after a few months I simply gave up. Like generations of students before me, I reluctantly accepted the dictum that `you should not try to understand quantum mechanics, since that will lead you astray for doing physics', and going even further, I also gave up trying to really understand classical mechanics! Psychological defense mechanisms turned my bitter sense of disappointment into a dull sense of disenchantment.""",1231694006

If I didn't have the low-paying job, my runway would disappear in 5-6 months just like the OP. As it stands, I take about $250 out of my runway a month, which means it will last much longer.<p>I don't really know of ""less obvious ways"" - what I do seems to me fairly obvious.<p>1) Rent - I pay $620 a month for a room in Brooklyn that fits my needs in a large apartment where a lot of other people live that's 20 minutes away on the subway from Manhattan (where I would assume the OP works). That's fairly low by anyone's standards, and I intend to keep it that way. I  know that if I were to move further out (or, let's say, move out of NYC) I would be able to get a larger place for that kind of money - but the point is that I don't need a larger place, so the ""per-square-foot ratio"" doesn't bother me at all. I have my own room. Ambient noise coming from the living room or from someone else's room is sometimes an issue (I live with musicians). Earplugs or headphones solve that.<p>The utilities are split between everyone in the house, the addition is fairly negligible.<p>1a) This is a somewhat unhelpful generalization, but it has been my experience that someone who was working for a hedge fund in New York is usually not the type of guy that will easily get along with a bunch of pot-smoking musicians that live in a recently gentrified but still somewhat ghetto neighborhood in Brooklyn. However, the OP left and became an  entrepreneur, so his soul may still be intact.<p>2) Food - there was a post sometime ago on how do startups minimize on food expenses. I believe PG's quote was ""Rice and beans. There's about 1000 variations"".<p>3) Dating - don't go to expensive restaurants where you are going to lose $150 in one night. A coffee in a local coffee-shop and a walk in the park or on the riverfront - $10, and you are going to have a better time anyway.<p>4) Sell all your old computer equipment. That old IBM X31 sitting on your bottom shelf that you replaced with the MacBook Pro? You can get around $300 for it on craigslist or ebay.<p>5) This is an anti-saving tip, but will work in your favor in the end - don't compromise on health insurance.<p>6) Clothing - I have maybe 2 or 3 outfits that are ""date"" or ""interview"" worthy. The rest are crappy t-shirts that I have from college.<p>There's no silver bullet, to paraphrase Brooks.

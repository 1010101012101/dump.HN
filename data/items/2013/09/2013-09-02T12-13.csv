No resourcefulness, no connections, no education. Crappy genes, crappy family. And none of it was his fault. He was truly doing his very best with what he had.</i><p>The basic goal of trying to maximize individual liberty is certainly sound. But we have to remember that as a species we evolved as groups, not just as individuals. The evolutionary fitness of a group is in part a function of how well its members act as though they&#x27;re all in the same boat, as opposed to every man for himself.  (As just one example, a basketball team that works together will usually beat a squad of prima donna ball-hogs.  See Robert Wright&#x27;s book <i>Non-Zero</i> for more details in a popularized format.)<p>In addition, we humans are inherently flawed -- to one degree or another:<p>+ We cling to easy answers, even when they&#x27;re wrong.<p>+ We seek immediate gratification, ignoring the long-term downside.<p>+ We want to be free to do whatever we want <i>and</i> for &quot;someone else&quot; to clean up any resulting mess.  (Think of the teen-aged boy who just drops his clothes on the floor, knowing that later his mother will pick them up. Or the banker that writes &quot;liar loans&quot; knowing the government will bail them out. Or the business that pours its waste into the local sewer system by night.)<p>So we humans still need <i>some</i> regulation, with an eye toward the longer term.",1378126791

6314926,comment,6314628,6314628,3,0,thinkersilver,,,"The author mentions that he spent a lot of time using English without ever listening to it. A big problem is the way English( or languages) are taught or learnt that causes these problems.<p>One trick/method that I used while perfecting my German accent was shadowing that I found in a lanaguage forum somewhere. I took a book that I understood in the target language, in this case it was Agatha Christie&#x27;s Murder on the Links; bought the audio book ( Mord auf dem Links), then repeated after the reader at pace without looking at the text. It was tiring mentally sometimes, but it helped greatly in pronunciation and aural comprehension of the  target langauge.<p>I did the same for movies. I remember getting the Matrix in German. Technical writing is different I guess but I hope this helps someone, at the very least, in acquiring an idiomatic proficiency.",1378126780

It doesn&#x27;t really make much sense because it&#x27;s a weird bastardisation of Germanic, Latinate, and Celtic languages (with a few choice French words for good luck). The pacing when speaking it can be pretty wonky because the words don&#x27;t really flow together like they do in other languages.<p>I don&#x27;t really understand the whole uproar over people&#x27;s grasp of English. If someone&#x27;s less proficient, or slower to respond; I wait patiently or simplify my own English to make it easier to understand. I&#x27;m genuinely impressed by how much effort everyone else puts in to learning the language that I can&#x27;t hold someone&#x27;s skill in it against them.

If my colleague refused to pay her the equivalent of two unemployment benefits (after tax) she would resign. The next week she did.</i><p>Perhaps we should think of unemployment benefits and minimum wage laws as a subsidy for technological progress, in particular automation and artificial intelligence.<p>Low-wage workers are competition for automation, at least in the early stages when a new technology is just getting off the ground. Remove them, and there is likely to be more demand for technological solutions to do what they used to do.

None of the rebuttals presented by the author of the &quot;faq&quot; are that strong as far as I am concerned. You would say that is because I have irrational beliefs and I would say that it is because the author completely ignores (as far as I can tell) the corporatocracy that big government enables; uses empirical evidence of phenomena from a big government environment and instead of attributing these phenomena to that environment, uses them as evidence against libertarian philosophies; and in general uses arguments that aren&#x27;t particularly compelling.<p>Now the truth is probably somewhere in the middle but I think it is important for you to at least acknowledge that your dismissal of other ideas or beliefs as lies can probably be attributed to bias as much as the converse.

The work consisted of a speller (published in 1783), a grammar (published in 1784), and a reader (published in 1785). His goal was to provide a uniquely American approach to training children. His most important improvement, he claimed, was to rescue &quot;our native tongue&quot; from &quot;the clamour of pedantry&quot; that surrounded English grammar and pronunciation. He complained that the English language had been corrupted by the British aristocracy, which set its own standard for proper spelling and pronunciation. Webster rejected the notion that the study of Greek and Latin must precede the study of English grammar. The appropriate standard for the American language, argued Webster, was &quot;the same republican principles as American civil and ecclesiastical constitutions&quot;. This meant that the people-at-large must control the language; popular sovereignty in government must be accompanied by popular usage in language.
Slowly, edition by edition, Webster changed the spelling of words, making them &quot;Americanized&quot;. He chose s over c in words like defense, he changed the re to er in words like center, and he dropped one of the Ls in traveler. At first he kept the u in words like colour or favour but dropped it in later editions. He also changed &quot;tongue&quot; to &quot;tung&quot;an innovation that never caught on.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Webster"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Webster</a>",1378125144

It has little to do with not helping the poor, but rather not let the government do it by means of force, and do it on a more personal, voluntary, connected, human level. And avoiding the mistakes of crony governments so that there are less poor people in the first place.<p>Coming from France where I grew up, you would be very surprised by the level of resentment instilled in the fabrics of the French society by socialism. People being tired of giving most of their earnings in taxes have little willingness to help people around them on a personal level.<p>It reminds me of an article I read (can&#x27;t find it anymore) about how Silicon Valley was not the Libertarian land it was painted because Silicon Valley companies were much more generous in sharing their success with employees through stock options. Well, again it was a misguided attribution, being generous has nothing non-Libertarian in it. At the contrary, low involvement of government restrictions and taxation in US companies in general (not that it is the lowest in CA), does allow these kind of thing to come about privately.

For example RSA is based on the problem of factoring large numbers, a problem that&#x27;s generally considered to be hard as we know of no efficient algorithm for solving it. But we haven&#x27;t proved that factoring large numbers will remain a hard to solve problem in the future. The NSA could very well have custom hardware for efficiently factoring 1024-bit primes by now and the upcoming quantum computing is a real threat. If they haven&#x27;t done it by now, 1024-bit keys will become breakable in the future, however 2048-bit keys are another issue entirely and 4096-bit keys will probably stay unbreakable.<p>But, even if breakthroughs in solving the integer factorization problem will be made in the future, as long as P != NP then perfect encryption is possible. In fact, we already know of encryption schemes that are provably unbreakable even with unlimited hardware at disposal, the problem being that they are also hard to implement, so we ended up with making tradeoffs.<p>Second, it&#x27;s far easier to attack a particular implementation, to bypass the encryption algorithm entirely, e.g. attacks against the key generation system, side-channels, the protocol of the software system we are talking about, etc ... because software always has bugs, as in zero-day exploits that one could make use of.<p>For this reason - if indeed the military is using different encryption algorithms for different security levels, algorithms that aren&#x27;t used in the wild, then to me that&#x27;s a pretty bad idea, as far more often than not it&#x27;s the implementation that&#x27;s broken, not the algorithm.

With that being said, we are only being exposed to a portion of the story which she has decided to share in a certain way. There may be circumstances which she chose not to mention out of respect for her husband&#x27;s legacy or her pride. What if her husband was not only verbally abusive but physically abusive? What if his friends or family blame her for his alcoholism or death? We don&#x27;t know the full context driving her decision to publish this in NYT, so to immediately dismiss her move as inappropriate seems a bit callous.<p>Her story also might help other people watching loved ones deteriorate take action before it&#x27;s too late, or may help people grieve following the death of a loved one under similar circumstances.

9615648,comment,9613797,9615536,0,0,djur,,,"I recently started using a Pebble (the classic model). I don&#x27;t traditionally wear watches. The core functionality -- being notified of text messages and phone calls with enough information to make a decision on whether I want to respond immediately -- is pretty much all I care about, although I have actually found myself surprised by how much I like being able to glance at the time without pulling out my phone.<p>The Pebble doesn&#x27;t even support things like reading emails, browsing the web, etc. and I wouldn&#x27;t want to use such a feature. The battery life is good and it charges quickly -- mentally it&#x27;s more in line with my Kindle than my phone as far as how much I think about its charge. If it runs out of batteries it isn&#x27;t the end of the world anyway.<p>My goal in getting it was to spend less time fiddling with my phone and concentrating more on life around me, while still not missing situations where a friend or loved one needs to get in touch urgently. A secondary motivation was to miss fewer calls (I am somewhat hard of hearing & frequently keep my phone&#x27;s ringer off anyway for professional reasons, and I do not always feel my phone vibrate through my jeans). The Pebble has been very successful in that regard and I consider the $99 well spent.<p>My hope is that even though Pebble is pursuing a somewhat higher-end market with the Pebble Time that they (or some other manufacturer) continue to produce a line of cheap, durable, minimalist smartwatches. I hope to be able to replace this one if it gets seriously damaged or becomes completely obsolete (if Bluetooth goes the way of the dodo, I guess). I have no interest in higher-end smartwatches.",1432778057

But occasionally I&#x27;ll get a 1 week token from cryptostorm (<a href=""https://cryptostorm.is/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cryptostorm.is/</a>)<p>They have an interesting model: you buy a token that expires after a certain length of time (1 week, 1 month, 1 year, etc). The clock doesn&#x27;t start ticking until the first time you log in. Instead of registering a username/password, you&#x27;re sent the token via email and your login ends up being a sha512 hash of the token for the username. There is no password associated, just the hash of the token is all you need.<p>I like this because you&#x27;re able to buy &#x27;disposable&#x27; accounts basically. They take bitcoin and some alt coins too, which is nice. Dns protection and access to .onion and .bit domains. It all seems pretty solid.

The question is then much closer to reality: &quot;Am I behaving in a way that pleases the legislators?&quot;  That is a very difficult question to answer, and the solution was to codify the wants of the legislators into laws :)  Unsurprisingly the process of translating the desires from the minds of men (and a few women) onto paper does not completely eliminate logical defects that pretty much everybody hosts.  So you end up with contradictory laws, our solution was to add another layer of human reasoning onto that - the judicial system.

As such, it remains effectively silent on the retributive, vindictive, medicinal and expiatory dimensions of the death penalty, which have been expounded by the Church previously. In other words, a woefully <i>incomplete</i> argument is put forward which muddies the issue rather than make a compelling case for imprisonment as the better option.<p>In more recent years, Catholic commentators, bishops, and now even a pope have gone further and declared the death penalty to be <i>&quot;inadmissible, no matter how serious the crime committed ... an offense against the inviolability of life and the dignity of the human person&quot;</i>, or similar.

    on Notre-Dame street. Investigators were looking for evidence
    showing that Uber Canada is violating tax laws

    Around 10:40 am, one of the investigators noticed 
    that &quot;some handsets, computers and tablets

I run AdSense on my site, and it kept running the same ad for an atrocious web game that a 10 year old could have made as their first programming project. I eventually saw the exact same ad running on another site, so I clicked it there in order to avoid the absurd rule that clicking ads on your own site gets you banned from AdSense. (Why don&#x27;t they just silently discard those clicks, since they know they are from the publisher?) Clicking the ad took me to a page which did not have a game at all; it just falsely claimed you could play a game if you installed their malware browser extension, which it immediately prompted me to install [2]. The extension actually has nothing whatsoever to do with games. It doesn&#x27;t enable you to play a game at all, anywhere. All it does is replace ads across the entire web with ads from its own ad network for the remainder of the lifetime of that computer. The extension has millions of installs and probably causes Google to lose seven figures per year in AdSense revenue due to so many AdSense ads being replaced with ads from another network. I also think it&#x27;s funny that ads were being run on my site for the specific purpose of installing malware that would replace the ads and destroy the ad revenue for the very same site that helped it get installed in the first place. I reported this extension three times using the official report forms for the directly relevant teams at Google (even explaining in detail how it damages their own AdSense platform, so unlike a typical consumer complaint, this was actually affecting their profits and they should listen for once), and I was consistently ignored.<p>1. <a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hola-better-internet/gkojfkhlekighikafcpjkiklfbnlmeio?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hola-better-intern...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/8JJVjZ2.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/8JJVjZ2.png</a>",1432776815

Partitions are about parallelism and don&#x27;t always fit the data model or domain.  While you can reduce the partitions to 1, this is limits parallelism.  It&#x27;s not always easy to design a partitioning scheme that preserves the replication semantics you want. And these semantics vary from having something totally ordered, to having something that you can replay on a very fine-grained level (to replicate to the client for instance.) Most discussions of the advantages of logs really emphasize how amazing a totally ordered log is for replication, but that&#x27;s not actually what production deployments look like so you still need to think carefully about what happens when writes are being applied to your datastores without a clear order.",1432775964

Why is everyone running away from C so badly that they are even willing to put up with PHP? That&#x27;s how much C sucks. The evidence is in everyone making other languages as soon as they can to get away from C. Look at Lua. People cannot even put up with writing their whole applications in C, it&#x27;s such a pain, they need an escape valve called Lua so they can breath a little.<p>That things are built atop C is the story of Academia in the USA. They have predominantly taught ALGOL-like languages and favored the Von Neumann architecture to complete detriment of Lambda Calculus. So it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s all people know, and they don&#x27;t know any better. C is so much the wrong language to write programming languages in, that they wrote Yacc, Bison, etc because programming parsers and lexers are so impossibly difficult to write in such a limited language like C, that people gave up, and made tools to generate C code for them. Eww. And that&#x27;s the industry standard, some smelly C code that vomits more C code that no one can write because C doesn&#x27;t offer the appropriate abstractions to deal with the problem. That&#x27;s technical debt. Your language is so weak no one has the balls to write a parser on it? Well guess what, throw it in the garbage and start over. Do not pass on that technical debt to further generations. If a language is weak, stop all work on it, move on to a stronger language that can express more things.<p>Which is why from very early on two schools of thought diverged and... just read &quot;Worse is Better&quot;. :)<p>Point is, C people think worse is better, they don&#x27;t want to take the time to make sure their stuff is solid because they like to brag that they get so much done and so clearly C must be better. I can make 10 sand castles in under an hour but when the sea flows it takes them with it. But no tsunami can take a stone castle. Why don&#x27;t you want to strive to build stone castles?<p>As a final point, consider that your precious C programs and the C compiler can only run because of the CPU, which was not written in C nor in any Von Neumann language - oh no, they were written functionally, with only logic gates, in a dataflow-oriented way, because you know, they really needed this to work. That&#x27;s why CPUs don&#x27;t have bugs - they picked a better starting language than C, with a principled approach (logic) that is amenable to mathematical verification. Guess what - functional programming languages are also increasingly more amenable to mathematical verification. Once this is popularized, you&#x27;ll be delegated to maintaining the old sand castles from dinosaurs while we will be building stone castles over here. Join us. :)",1432774890

For that I would need to see actual, regular controlled experiments from PL researchers showing that a given language or construct yields measurable dividends over another, such as reductions in deficits, program size, or development time. Instead what you get from PL researchers is papers full of conjecture advocating some such language or construct, but seldom any scientific evidence to support any of it. Further, programming languages by themselves, in 2015, don&#x27;t matter that much. Unless a language has an industrial-strength implementation, a robust tool chain, and a vast collection of libraries, it won&#x27;t, or at least shouldn&#x27;t, gain widespread adoption.<p>I think we have far too many languages as it is. Of all the languages I&#x27;ve learned or at least been exposed to, only a handful were genuinely novel, such as Common Lisp/Scheme, Smalltalk, and Haskell, and rest were mere reskins of C. The compile-to-JavaScript languages are easily some of the worst offenders, and it leads me to wonder, how many new languages are the product of a good faith effort to solve a yet-unsolved or poorly-solved problem, and how many spring largely from the vanity of their inventor, who dreams of becoming the next great BDFL, being invited to give keynotes at conferences, and capriciously giving his thumb up or down to enhancement proposal like a Roman Emperor deciding on the fate of a fallen gladiator in the Colosseum?<p>I actually think we as an industry could benefit from a PL moratorium.

1979333,comment,1978709,1979082,0,0,bluedevil2k,,,"Agreed.  Most use case scenarios will involve a code library wrapper around the API.  There's some unique challenges in building the library as well though - in a small & quick start-up, it might be hard to find experienced programmers in the 7-10 languages you'd want to support.  When you get an experienced PHP developer to write the Java API, it will work, but will it ""work""?  In other words, will it follow the conventions that Java programmers are used to (classes, objects as parameters, static methods, etc.), or will it simply be ported PHP code to Java (hashtables as parameters to every method, fewer objects, etc.).<p>I've often said you can tell how good a code library is for an API based on how often the user needs to read the API documentation - ideally, they would never need to even read the API.  After all, why have a code library if the users still need to look up the exact spelling and capitalization scheme of string parameters, or look up the numerical codes in return values?",1291736303

Do you think WikiLeaks will have a chilling effect on diplomacy, and, you know, back-room talks.<p>KEVIN RUDD: I think it's having a focusing effect.<p>QUESTION: As far as, you know, making people more cautious, and making diplomacy [indistinct]?<p>KEVIN RUDD: I think foreign ministers around the world, from countries of all sorts of political traditions, are scratching their heads about this one at the moment - I'm just being frank with you - and particularly when, if we are dealing with diplomatic communications the content of which, if we are to be consistent with our profession, we then don't comment on.<p>At the same time this has created real difficulties in various other parts of the world. Let's just put all this in a bit of context. You've had recent reports concerning - heads of government have been accused of corruption, being associated with the Mafia, been urging the United States to go to war against particular countries. I mean this has been happening in recent times. And without commenting, again, on the content or accuracy of any of those reports, it does create a separate and new dynamic.<p>Now, what's the challenge for all of us? I was actually asked this question in Bahrain yesterday - what now happens? I think, rule number one for our friends in the United States is how do you tighten things up a bit? I think that's a fair old question.<p>REPORTER: Security [indistinct]<p>KEVIN RUDD: Well, it's just - you know, maybe two million or so people having access to this stuff is a bit of a problem.<p>REPORTER: It's not the Lady Gaga CD.<p>KEVIN RUDD: The - that could be a bit of a problem.<p>But secondly, I reckon, what I believe to be the professional challenge for all of us, is to get on with the business, because all the big challenges we're dealing with haven't gone away.<p>I had a question before about the Korean Peninsula, that is real, and live, and contemporary. And diplomacy, and the business of diplomacy, is underway, as we speak, on that. And if diplomacy gets it wrong on that then we all pay a very big price.<p>So these challenges don't just go into suspended animation while we work our way through this stuff. So my answer, in Bahrain, as it is here today, is all of us to get on with the business, and not to become fundamentally side-tracked by all of this.<p>But there are deep lessons, in terms of providing proper protection for such a large volume of diplomatic documents.",1291736152

There are very few places left unexplored by the human race on this planet.  However, on an individual level, if you have never been to the summit of Everest, then it is very much a personal exploration.  Maps and guides reduce the required effort from superhuman to formidable, but I see a clear exploratory factor.<p>At a personal level -- answering the question ""what have I explored"" rather than ""what has the human race explored"" -- the chasm between having crossed the Hillary Step and merely having read a description of it is vast.  You are exploring your own limits in a purely figurative sense, and this could be boiled down to ""thrill-seeking"", but you are also literally exploring the terrain and geography, figuring out how to hoist your own personal mass beyond each obstacle.  It is this very personal sense of exploration that I think drives most non-professional mountaineers.<p>Also, even at a macro / organizational level, completely new routes are tried (explored!), and the route through the Khumbu Icefall changes every year.",1291735327

This was a final straw that pushed me over the ""I don't really care for the syntax of this language much"" cliff.<p>Not a showstopper, but combined with a number of other small complaints, Python ""rubbed me the wrong way"" too.  Yeah, significant whitespace alone isn't a problem.  Lack of variable definition by itself isn't a big deal.  Explicit ""Self"" as a parameter is kind of annoying but makes sense.  The lame anonymous functions that don't have the full power of the language are ugly.  Taken together those are enough to turn me off to the language.<p>BUT, Python has a few killer features like great libraries, flexible built in data structures, and an <i>excellent</i> foreign function interface.  If I needed a scripting language for a native-code app it would be one of the top choices.<p>By the way, my experience with Python is a few years old, I don't know if anything's changed with the new version.<p>Edit to add: Other dynamic languages have various solutions to the variable declaration problem, usually involving a parser or compiler warning when you use an unbound variable.

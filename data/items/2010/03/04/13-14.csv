Sometimes the packaging of a program has bugs in it though, so the situation you describe sometimes happens, but I've only ever seen it happen when I'm installing random Ubuntu packages in my Debian install though.<p>So, yes, while you're right that shared libraries can sometimes cause the problems you describe, a good package manager will pretty much fix them. But what I love the most about Linux though is that if something bad like that happens (like the ABI of a shared library changing)... it's a minor inconvenience, but so what?<p><pre><code>    apt-get source $package\n    cd $package-$version\n    apt-get build-dep $package\n    dpkg-buildpackage\n    cd ..\n    dpkg -i *.deb\n</code></pre>\nAnd bam, you just rebuild the program against the new shared library with the different ABI, and everything works. Obviously this isn't ""user friendly"", but then again I never had to do this before I started mixing packages from different OSes together. And isn't it so easy to do! You can just do that for any program in on your whole computer! ""Hmmm, I wonder how this program works"", and one command later you have its source code! Another command later and you've built all of that code, into a nice Debian package too. It's so wonderful to have such a powerful package manager.",1267710616

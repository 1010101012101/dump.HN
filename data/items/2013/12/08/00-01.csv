ISPs do have to do things HN readers don&#x27;t like to make the government happy (like comply with secret warrants), but they are not legally required to buy CDNs to make some sort of user tracking easier.  The NSA can wiretap a CDN as easily as they can wiretap Verizon.<p>Perhaps Verizon thinks the business is underpriced for the value it offers, or they want to deliver a better user experience to their customers?<p>Nahh... it must be some conspiracy!!!11!",1386464399

6868488,comment,6867363,6867363,4,0,dashdot,,,"In Switzerland, we have the dual education system [1]. This means highschool students usually choose a profession while they&#x27;re still in school and go for an apprenticeship after graduation. An apprenticeship in  ICT-professions takes 4 years and when finished successfully they receive the &quot;Federal Certificate of Competence&quot;.<p>There is a program called &quot;Informa&quot; [2] which validates the knowledge of experienced craftsmen and gives them a chance to receive the same kind of degree like apprentice graduates. Which also makes them eligible to further education paths, like higher professional schools (to get a diploma if you like).<p>If you want to move to Switzerland, you don&#x27;t have to worry about the language.

6868469,comment,6868398,6868398,1,0,001sky,,,"Its not clear at all an MBA gives a competitive advantage to a startup founder in the current era.<p>It is true that many companies fail for reasons that may have been more obvious to an MBA than a lay-person, but failure-mitigation and success propogation are only co-incidentally linked. Failure mitigation is a boundary constraint, not a primary explanatory relationship or variable.<p>Common sense business advisory, industry networking, and start-up specific logistical information is now provided by a variety of experts and emergent institutions (eg, YC and other accelerators, with VCs and Board members, and en extremis a variety of biz-dev types available for consultancy and freelance work.)<p>There are definitly also counter-examples, and one that comes to mind is Gilt (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilt_Groupe"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilt_Groupe</a>), but I&#x27;m not sure this isn&#x27;t the type of exception that proves the rule. That is to say entrenpreneurs build starups, and they may may not have, need, or want an MBA.<p>The other consideration here is survivorship bias. Many people in the &quot;mba cohort&quot; may have de-risked their entry into the middle class/management ranks such that it just doesn&#x27;t make sense to take any path more risky. That is to say, the development of firm-specific (and tech specific) skills inherent in a startup may prevent the MBA from following up a failed opportunity and jumping back into an &quot;MBA&quot; career path on even ground, if the field is something like banking, consulting, marketing, ect...ie, the traditional MBA paths. Its not clear that such an experience adds significant market value in many areas.

6868467,comment,6867638,6867638,12,0,JulianMorrison,,,"&quot;Many worlds&quot; makes this &quot;instantaneous&quot; communication moot, which is why I&#x27;m surprised so many physicists are barking up the other tree. In &quot;many worlds&quot; what actually happens when a thing &quot;decoheres&quot; is that the experimenter gets <i>pulled into</i> its superposition. So now instead of a dead-alive cat and one scientist, you&#x27;ve got one dead cat, one alive cat, one sad scientist, one happy scientist. Or from another perspective, a dead-alive cat and a sad-happy scientist - the superposition still exists, but the number of things inside it has increased.<p>So, &quot;I flip a coin and whichever it comes up, heads or tails, the other entangled coin flipped at the same instant comes up the the opposite, with instantaneous communication&quot; is the wrong view. Rather, the coins are entangled (in the past), and observing them pulls the observers into the entanglement one atom at a time as the informational contagion spreads, so now you have world A, where scientists saw &quot;heads, tails&quot; and world B where the same scientists saw &quot;tails,heads&quot;. The scientists got slurped in, but they are simply observing an entanglement that <i>existed and still exists</i> and which was established in the past. Only now they are observing it from inside.<p>Quantum spooky action &quot;at a distance&quot; is local in &quot;many worlds&quot; and never needs to be faster than light.",1386463976

I have a hard time thinking of any trade that an average person would struggle to thrive in if they were willing to do the work. A few exist, but to use them as a reason to avoid trade work is disingenuous.<p>In fact, even working as a labourer at an oil well is easy enough that one of my friends who normally works as a graphic designer did it for a few months while traveling in Canada. The hardest part of his experience was that he didn&#x27;t see his girlfriend very much.<p>I spent the first 23 years of my life as a weak, desk-dwelling geek. I never thought I could work a trade. I never even thought a trade was worthwhile work. Now I&#x27;m an industrial electrician with a great job and a fulfilling life. The work is &#x27;hard&#x27;, sure. There&#x27;s a lot of manual labour and the sites we work at (abattoirs, waste water treatment plants, chemical mixing plants etc) are all unpleasant for one reason or another, but the day you get over yourself and get properly stuck into the job you realise that it&#x27;s actually worthwhile work and it isn&#x27;t even very hard. Even for somebody who spent the majority of their life training to work at a desk.<p>Comparing trade work to being an elite athlete is absurd, too. Statistically speaking, there&#x27;s no reason what so ever that would prevent you from doing well in a trade. Quite the opposite. Most trades just require somebody willing to do the work. They don&#x27;t require unusually high IQ (although high creativity can be great for problem solving), they don&#x27;t require unusually high fitness, they just require somebody to do the work. If you want to do well, do lots of work.<p>It&#x27;s pretty simple. Most people just aren&#x27;t willing to do it because they don&#x27;t think trade work is respectable.

It gets a bit hard on subsequent layers though.<p>decision trees are an order of magnitude easier to interpret though, they are very compact and consist of a number of binary decision in the input space. For a given classification you only need to look at log(d) decisions to work out how it got to its conclusion. Its not usually that hard to how it arrived at the tree from training.<p>The relationship between the Jacobian and the training is fairly convoluted, given back propagation and cross validation.<p>PS so back-prorogation uses weights differentiated against outputs. Jacobian is input differentiated against outputs. You can do smart things with Jacobian aware neural architectures.

6868438,comment,6866652,6868007,3,0,kefka,,,"This automation argument applies to everything in the US, and the world.<p>Previously in the history of the world, we had to do things with our own hands, or use manual tools that used our hands. (Shovels, spades, rakes,...)<p>Then we migrated to machines that we could sit in or stand in, that could greatly magnify our strength (vehicles, trains, gas powered stuffs).<p>Now, we entered a realm back in the &#x27;60s with powerful automation via computers. And it&#x27;s only gotten more powerful, smaller, and cheaper. But yet, computers have always been bad for many types of manual jobs because of fuzziness.<p>And now, our computers are dirt cheap and damn fast. And they can handle fuzziness and broad input. And they are replacing jobs rather quickly. But so what? Whom does this make money for? Well, people who can afford the means of production. And that answer takes us back to a treatise that was written back in the late 1800&#x27;s: The Communist Manifesto.<p>But wait a moment... Communism fails because people seek &quot;fair&quot; compensation. For example, a doctor _should_ get paid more than a burger flipper, right? It seems logical that the more work you put into attaining the position should be relevant to the pay of that position. But what happens when those screws are turned, and you now compete with auto-doc or auto-flipper? You end up with lowering wages. Most of the times, those wages get lowered directly to 0.<p>But we then hear the old saying: When the buggy whip manufacturers died out, it opened up automotive manufacturing. Well, yes. When a segment closes, another opens, but usually the segment is smaller. For example, when a factory is mostly laid off due to automation, the few that are kept are the ones that can program and debug software and hardware. And they then are also &#x27;encouraged&#x27; to work harder. Then this harder is the new average.<p>And these new employees are doing the work of 2-3 people, because it is what is expected of them to keep their job. And then automation takes over even these people, because automation can do the job of 10 people (or more!) with low error rates. But this is a look at an individual.<p>Now, what happens nationally? Well, we see higher numbers of unemployed and subsidized users (food stamps, WIC, housing, other means tested benefits). But why? Because automation does work, and well. But it leads to the ones whom can afford it more money, and workers without. But is Communism the answer? Maybe... Or perhaps a post-capitalism answer is needed; one that blends all of the needs of citizens and some of the wants, whilst not ignoring that those whom work harder/smarter should also be compensated for their hard work.<p>And of course, we&#x27;ve heard about the the Canadian program of Mincome, as well as Switzerland&#x27;s possible venture into this territory. Is this a solution? I believe so, even as a simple humanitarian solution of compassion for fellow man.",1386463427

The direction in which a stack grows depends on the architecture. Some programming languages don&#x27;t have one stack and one heap that grow into each other but instead several memory areas while still being single threaded (I think prolog or some logic oriented languages have such a more complicated concept).<p>Management of the stack is done by the program, not by the OS. How the program does it depends on the language and unless you use assembler it is hidden by the compiler. There is a calling convention, not one single way a call works. Some C compilers expose ways to define a different than the standard calling convention for a function. You might say that how a function call works is to much detail and not what you understand about how the stack works. Anyway, some languages have segmented stacks, meaning if a stack is used up a new stack is allocated and referred to by the old one (rust supported this at some point).<p>There are also languages that have different heaps per thread (rust for gc-ed objects). Per-thread heaps are a good idea because otherwise you would need to use some sort of synchronization for malloc and free, which defeats the purpose of threads. Usually this is done by reserving a memory area for a thread and only when this is exhausted and a new memory area needs to be allocated some sort of potentially blocking call (I think usually mmap?) for another area is called.",1386461140

The duration of the time slot was the hard limit they were working against and it ensured a tight focus on the content.  You received a lot of information in a short burst of time.<p>Amateur podcasts by contrast can go on for however long the interviewer would like.  The result seems to be an unstructured rambling chat rather than a to-the-point discussion, and you can’t skim it like a blog post or text article to pull out the valuable points – you have to listen to the whole danged thing.<p>Perhaps if podcasts were set to have a hard limit of ten minutes we’d see a spike in quality?

We're running in 18 directions right now from the gut and determined to get our startup off of the ground.  But when we first presented our stuff a couple weeks back we realized that some stuff that seems clear to us, because we're so close to the problem, wasn't coming through in the presentation.  If we'd had a group to pre-pitch that through, we might have gotten a ""Huh?"" at a more appropriate moment.<p>A lot of people also seem to be looking for co-founders (we're not, but this seems to be a common problem).  In a community they might be able to find that.<p>Another bit is that it seems pretty much all VCs / Angels prefer personal introductions.  Well, that assumes you've got them.  We're starting to pull them out of the woodwork, with a few good leads, but we may have a couple dozen pitches before we get a bite, which means we're going to need a lot of introductions.  I'm super-well connected to hacker culture in the OSS world, but that doesn't translate over to seed funding.<p>All of that is why I'd like to see a group come together.  It's not a fear of bulldozing our way through the startup world, or a desire to hold hands and reaffirm each other, just an acknowledgement that some people will have smart stuff to say, and hopefully we'll notice.  Some people will have dumb stuff to say, and hopefully we'll ignore it.",1207932116

161130,comment,161089,161107,0,0,jmzachary,,,"That might be true for small companies, but large companies (Intel, MS, Google, etc.) might realize cost savings by the difference in wages paid to immigrants versus U.S. workers.<p>I think the immigrant vs. American worker stems from a fear or intuition that there are, indeed, a finite number of jobs and, possibly, that the number is trending down, not up, for the developer/designer kinds of jobs. Let's be honest here, IT, admin, maintenance, and testing jobs are lower caste than architect, design, and coding. Jobs in the first category, on average, pay less than the the jobs in the second. I think the number of positions required in the second category are on the decline. As the computer software industry matures and evolves, we just don't require so many developers. If and when we start moving towards a realized utility computing future (Ref. The Big Switch by N. Carr), we won't need as many maintainers and admins, either. Of course, it doesn't help to watch many of these jobs go overseas, either. Combine that with H1-B visas, and American tech workers can be forgiven for a little bit of xenophobia. But, maybe it's possible that broader economic and industry trends are the real issue. That's my theory, and I could be wrong.",1207931867

Being a good entrepreneur IMHO rests a LOT on your ability to take risks, do things in a radically different way (often out of ignorance) and to just get stuff done without talking about it.<p>Networking and engaging with a community works well when you're trying to learn something initially (programming language, other technologies, and, yes, even entrepreneurial skills), but isn't much use when it comes to actually breaking through.. indeed, it can be a hinderance if you actually adjust your plans or thinking on what other people are saying, as that could limit your success.<p>Good luck if you are trying to boost morale or just provide a place for entrepreneurs to share stories.. but I'm not so confident that setting up networks for people to actually bounce ideas around is a good idea at all.

Podcasts may be less successful than their most breathless hype predicted... but what invention isn't?<p>Podcasts are a modest success. They're modest, in part, because the masters of podcasting turn out to be radio producers. This is <i>completely</i> unsurprising -- the radio folks have been evolving their audio production skills in a competitive environment for nearly a <i>century</i> -- and it's the very un-surprisingness of it that keeps the phenomenon under the radar. Who besides advertisers knows or cares what the audience of a radio program is? Radio hasn't been the stuff of tech news since the 1930s.<p>The other problem with podcasting is that the term is badly chosen and too narrowly defined. The word is associated with downloading (rather than streaming), audio (rather than video), RSS (rather than simple web links), the use of portable devices for playback (rather than PCs), and amateur production (rather than pros). Youtube and its clones represent the same core phenomenon as podcasting -- ubiquitous, cheap distribution of audio and video over the web -- except that they offer better UI and lower costs for users, producers, <i>and</i> advertisers. But somehow the word ""podcasting"" isn't used for Youtube.<p>It's not the podcasting phenomenon that's ""failing"": It's the <i>word</i> ""podcasting"", and the specific constellation of technologies that it implies.",1207929825

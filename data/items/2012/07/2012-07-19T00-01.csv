While the description in the Google font database makes it out to be an award winning face for literature optimized for reading, its exaggerated serifs and uneven rhythm give it a kind of medieval / enlightened manuscript feel that just seems anachronistic and weird. For a general service that integrates with Github and shouldn't really be 'saying' anything with its design, I would recommend a more classic, rhythmic serif face along the lines of Minion, Caslon, Palatino, Baskerville, Hoefler Text, or even Georgia, which reads quite well at 14-16px.<p>Granted I'm a designer, I personally wouldn't use this service based on the typeface choice alone. It just clashes too much with the neutrality of everything else on my system and on websites I use commonly.",1342659558

They're currently in the process of relaunching with focus being on media not as just another social network to compete with Facebook.

And they are right (although some of the specific links might be replacing one kind of nutrisionalism with another).<p>Here's the difference. Nutrition science <i>IS</i> science. It's results come from controlled, replicable experiments, checked via peer review and analyzed correctly for significance.<p>Nutritionism is the belief that food is just the sum of independent nutrients and other substances, and once we know what nutrients we need we and which substances are bad, we can rearrange and pick and choose to get an ideal diet, coupled with the belief that we know enough from nutrition science to actually understand enough of nutrients and other food substances to actually do this.<p>Nutritionism <i>IS</i> <i>NOT</i> science. It is to nutritional science what pop psychology is to neurobiology.<p>Here are some examples (based on real things, but I do not have specific references handy so I'm going to keep the details generic). Suppose nutrition science finds that substance X is vital to health, and that carrots are high in substance X, and that people who eat a couple servings of carrots a week get enough substance X.<p>Synthesizing substance X (or extracting it from carrots) and adding it to to some other food, and then telling people that they can use that other food as a source of substance X is nutritionalism, not nutrition science. Or making X pills for people and telling them these can supply the X they are not getting from their diet is nutritionist, not nutrition science.<p>This is because it is possible that in order for our digestive system to actually extract and absorb substance X, it needs something else (substance Y) which is found in carrots, but is not found in those supplements or in the food that the synthetic X is added to--and so people getting X in the supplement or additive form are not actually making it available to their bodies.<p>The X supplements do not move from nutritionalism until scientists actually do the experiments and show that we can incorporate X in that form, or gain sufficient understanding of the mechanism by which X is absorbed to be able to say it will work in supplement form.<p>Another example: for almost everything we are told we must eat more of (fish, carbohydrates) or less of (red meat, carbohydrates, fats, cholesterol), there exists some culture for which (1) their traditional diet goes massively against that advice, and (2) people who eat that diet are healthy.<p>That's because the advice we get in these areas is NOT based on nutrition science. It is based on nutritionalism. The science that says that, say, red meat is bad for you ACTUALLY says that in particular studies of particular populations, red meat was bad. For people that strongly match the characteristics of the populations in those studies (e.g., whose complete diet is similar to the complete diet of the participants, and who live similar lifestyles) the conclusion that they should avoid red meat is probably pretty accurate. Since there are other populations in which red meat consumption does not appear to lead to those bad health effects, however, the proper conclusion is that the dire effects of red meat cannot be generalized outside of populations like the study populations.<p>Your best bet if you want to avoid nutritionalism is to try to stick to proven traditional diets. If the people of some region or culture have been eating a certain way for hundreds of years, and are in good health, that's pretty damn good evidence that their diet as a whole works. If someone's theory says that they should be in poor health because their diet includes too much X, or doesn't have enough Y, then that someone's theory is incomplete or wrong. In science, when results and theory disagree, results win.",1342657727

Doing this turns these roads effectively into local-access-only routes for cars and there's very little traffic. My bike ""path"" to and from work is about 8 miles of 35'-wide, paved road.

Both were born without birth defects, though when they reached their teenage years, they said they got sick more often than some of their friends. Both are still alive. The Yamaguchis' young son, Kasutoshi, lived to be 58 and died of cancer.</i><p>Sure, the Japanese had expected the effects to be worse, but still, this doesn't sound like a glowing recommendation to me to have kids after having been exposed to mad amounts of radiation.<p>From the Atomic Bomb Museum:<p>A Nagasaki survey of 98 pregnant women exposed at a distance of 2.0 km from ground zero and 113 pregnant women exposed at 4.0 and 5.0 km from ground zero, showed a high percentage of neonatal and infantile deaths for those exposed within a 2.0 km range, as well as signs of acute radiation illness such as loss of hair, bleeding tendency, and inner mouth lesions. Mental retardation was noted in 25% of newborn survivors.<p>Besides high mortality rates, retarded growth and development was also indicated. Most notable in those exposed within 1.05.0 km of ground zero were retarded stature, underweight, and smaller head circumference, a condition called microcephaly, one of the most pathetic aftereffects of the atomic bombings, especially when accompanied by mental retardation.<p>Genetic surveys have not yielded positive evidence of genetic hazards due to atomic bomb radiation. Even so, possible A-bomb-induced effects such as spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, congenital malformations, and more, require continued study.<p><a href=""http://atomicbombmuseum.org/3_health.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://atomicbombmuseum.org/3_health.shtml</a><p>Or this one, 24 years after the Chernobyl disaster (no bombing, but high radiation nonetheless):<p><a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/03/24/us-defect-chernobyl-idUSTRE62N4L820100324"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/03/24/us-defect-chernoby...</a>",1342656373

Using open source code that's been subject to lots of eyes and lots of use, e.g. a framework like Django, reduces the surface area, to me, because of the shared best-interest of fixing security problems. The key is staying up-to-date.<p>Not that you shouldn't understand the potential vectors against your site, or shouldn't read how to use these tools correctly, but a widely tested and used tool or framework, just like a widely researched crytpo algorithm, is better than one with no other eyes on it.",1342656323

The bank end gets the GPS+IMEI or whatever, produces the one-time code and texts it to the user. The user then enters the one-time code and their password on the login screen - perhaps it's used locally to encrypt the password (to combat MITM) before sending over the https connection.<p>For those without smartphones then charge for a dongle or have a phone based system that you can telephone (enter your postcode and get back the one-time code).<p>?",1342656256

There are lots of books/papers/talks on why that is but they boil down to 'problem' people spend more time creating problems on the Internet because it makes them feel better about themselves. 'helpful and polite' people spend more time actually getting things done because that makes them feel better about themselves. So combination creates a disproportionate share of 'problem' people in forums and other online communities.<p>Create an invitation only version of Stack Overflow perhaps and require 100% full transparency on participants (real names, job, and affiliations).

Many people just don't share this assumption of yours.  In fact, if many people did, Hacker News and ycombinator would be a very empty and lonely place - just look at all the startups: 99% are ""some existing idea where we have made a small and novel tweak that makes it better"" - PG even openly encourages startups to pitch their ideas that way (we've made X for Y).  The top link right now is gist.io and the entire page explaining it is about how similar it is to a bunch of other services but they've made it slightly better for one special case.

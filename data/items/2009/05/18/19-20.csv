I think the example I gave in the presentation was that if you were implementing a user comments feature, you could reference the spec to find the other parts of the site/app that also need user comments and implement a single solution that will cover all cases.<p>One of the downsides to agile is that you don't always know what's coming further down the road, so you either have to build extremely generic solutions (usually a waste) or very specific solutions that get adapted over time (refactoring is also wasteful).<p>In situations where budget is tight - which is the position I was coming from - it is optimal to have solutions that are Just Generic Enough to cover needs.<p>Thanks for your comments :)",1242676696
615568,comment,615306,615306,0,0,chime,,,"Everything in moderation, including moderation.<p>Every now and then I run across a story like this where someone is overburdened with communication and technology and wants to give it all up for a fixed time to cleanse themselves from the toxicity of modern life. Then they come back renewed, with new energy to conquer it all, and tell everyone how great it is and that everyone should give solitary confinement or meditation a serious attempt. Then a few months later, they get back into their old overloaded lifestyle of stress and constant work.<p>No, you don't need to give it all up for a month or year to find yourself. This is reaching out to the other extreme because you hope to end up in the center eventually. How about just slowly moving to the center from where you are? Get rid of the email+text features from you cellphone. Billions of people live perfectly fine without it. Keep GPS/web on your phone but only use when needed. Feel free to check your email whenever you have a few minutes but don't reply to it immediately. Shape your routine so you get to do what's important and not just what's urgent.<p>When not doing something productive or relaxing on the computer, step away. Go kayaking, hiking, camping, or jogging. Go to the movies, mall, museum, theater, art show, or a theme park. Get a backyard project, build something in real life, get your hands dirty. And while you do all of this, make adequate use of the technology available to you without feeling crushed under it. The purpose of technology is to solve real-life problems. It is not to replace real-life with a 24/7 stream of stress. People are good in general. Don't ignore them for a month because they contact you too much using different mediums. Spend more time with them in person, even if they annoy you. And use your knowledge of technology to enrich your and their lives. What good is 15 years of computer knowledge if you renounce it instead of sharing it with others?<p>Connectivity is not bad. What is bad is not knowing what form of communication to give more value to. Figure out your communication medium hierarchy and live by it. Mine goes:<p><pre><code>    Face-2-Face > Video chat > Phone > Email > Message boards > Social Networks\n</code></pre>\nMy social goal is to take people from the lower end and move them towards higher end. So I may get a friend message me through Facebook, then we'll email, then phone, with the final goal to hang out next time one of us is in town. Without technology, none of this would be possible. I love technology, but only enough to enable me to improve my real-life social activities.",1242676681

Before the internet, I had to ignore most of these to get anything done, since I would have ended up spending a very large percentage of my time writing them down and researching them, and most of those thoughts just weren't worth it.<p>Now, though, I can put the book down for a moment and look up most of these instantly, and then go back to the book. Or not, because often the new questions that arise from the answers to these, and <i>their</i> answers, are more interesting than the fiction novel I was reading -- and this is part of my point: that the internet has both vastly increased the number of things I can find out about and my total consumption of information, and has greatly increased my average interest in what I'm doing, since I can stop and do something more interesting (in my own time) at any time.  Usually whatever novel or textbook I was reading in the 80s was so boring that I wouldn't bother with it at all now, but at the time it was just the most interesting thing I had, and all the immediate alternatives to ""read this book"" were even more boring.  I didn't have a great childhood, in retrospect, but at the time it seemed that my major problem was boredom.<p>I guess that's enough self-examination for one post.  :)",1242676251

615535,comment,615306,615470,0,0,Silentio,,,"Conceiving of the human as ""social animal"" rather than individualized monadic unit may be new, but the evidence for the human as socially constructed being is not. From our very first experience as infants we are engaged in social relationships with our primary care giver that lays the groundwork for who we will become. It can be said that it is impossible for any human to escape her community, for she <i>is</i>, in a sense, her community.  See Heinz Kohut for more on this: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_Kohut"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_Kohut</a><p>This presents and interesting answer to the following:<p>>> That's a contradiction, humans are social animal and the rise of telecommunications and the internet is just the current technological advancement in that direction.<p>Sometimes one might need to get away from the buzz of the other's communication to listen to the community we carry around in our heads.<p>As for Monasticism: While a completely individual monastic lifestyle has been practiced, it is rare in the history of Western monasticism. Also, as I said above, an individual withdrawing from human contact does not mean she is not in ""community.""  Medieval Christian monastic communities, for their part, were just that, ""communities."" Monks in these communities lived together and depended on one another for survival. And while they did feel the urge (maybe more properly understood as a 'call') to separate themselves from the community at large, they normally did not cloister their communities far away from urban population centers and were often an integral part of the Medieval economy.<p>Even the ""Desert Fathers,"" one of the earliest forms of Christian Monasticism, though often viewed as making a radical break from their society, distanced themselves from society in general but not from all humans specifically. Furthermore, these communities depended heavily on links back to the community they had originated from for food, water, and the prayer they thought necessary to exist in the harsh climate of the dessert.<p>I would go so far as to say that Monasticism, though it does necessitate an intentional distancing of oneself from society at large, is actually a form of a radically <i>social</i> community not experienced by most humans. I think the same can be said about colonialists and rural farmers. Individuals in both of these groups can be said to depend heavily on support from the other for their survival.<p>Finally, urban existence can be a very lonely for many people. Industrialization and urbanization both create a feeling of what Max Weber termed ""anomie."" <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomie"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomie</a> In the history of colonization especially, I would think one thing colonists sought to escape was not social interaction with other humans, but the felt sense of anomie created by living amongst too many humans at once in an oppressive environment.  Seen this way, colonists, monks, and farmers all escape from environments hostile to the human ""social animal"" and arrive in an environment more suitable for the social interaction we cannot help but crave.<p>Footnote: I should add that I know there are rich traditions of monasticism other than Christian monasticism but I'm not qualified to speak on them.",1242675175

They symbolically kill Darwin, the story's central power figure and the main avatar of the hegemonic singularity. Yet they do so in an attempt to erase the boundaries between themselves and that oppressive structure. Darwin, whose domination of humanity has rendered him godlike, grants them their wish and transforms them into the insipid tourist children they wish to become. In the end, their struggle for justice and self-determination has come to nothing, and they go, indistinguishable from the other siblings, for ice cream.<p>You should also consider its similarity to the 1975 short story 'Let's go to Golgotha'",1242673802

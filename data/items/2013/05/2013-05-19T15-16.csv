A site for open consultations where people can express pain points in their daily lives. Of course you'd have to make it conversational enough to where people without the ability to adequately identify and express their pain points can do so with ease. Often people don't realize a pain point until a solution is available.<p>People with the power to reduce/remove such pain points would stand a better chance at identifying real need and business opportunities.<p>You can do this with your friends, co-workers, family, or neighbors. You may find a few problems to fix and may even come up with a few solutions. And you might get lucky with a viable solution.<p>But, expand that premise to the country or the world. Now you're talking about learning about problems you didn't even know existed. Problems that you personally might be able to solve. And you have a community of ""solvers"" waiting to help. The ""co-founder"" website finder is built right in.",1368979177

5733208,comment,5733010,5733010,9,0,nbpoole,,,"<i>""This wouldn't happen if Yahoo had a Vulnerability Reward Program""</i><p>As much as I support these kinds of programs (<a href=""https://nealpoole.com/blog/responsible-disclosure-programs/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://nealpoole.com/blog/responsible-disclosure-programs/</a>), that's a false dichotomy. Some companies have responsible disclosure policies or vulnerability reward programs. Some companies don't.<p>Anecdotally, the companies that do have programs don't inherently respond more quickly or handle reports better (ie: <a href=""https://nealpoole.com/blog/2013/04/experiences-with-the-yandex-bug-bounty-program/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://nealpoole.com/blog/2013/04/experiences-with-the-yand...</a>, <a href=""https://nealpoole.com/blog/2013/03/csrf-persistent-xss-in-my-ebay-com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://nealpoole.com/blog/2013/03/csrf-persistent-xss-in-my...</a>). In contrast, companies that don't have programs may still be very responsive and willing to work with researchers; I reported issues to GitHub, Etsy, and Facebook before their respective programs were in place and they always responded quickly and effectively.<p>It comes down to the people who focus on security at the company and the way in which security is prioritized. If your company doesn't value and prioritize security, a responsible disclosure program won't make anyone's life easier.<p>In that sense, I do think that companies can and should do a better job of working with security researchers, regardless of whether they have a responsible disclosure program or vulnerability reward program in place. If a company takes security seriously, it should make it easy for researchers to report vulnerabilities. Researchers shouldn't feel that their reports are being sent into a black hole: if they do, they'll be less likely to spend their time reporting issues in the future.",1368978907

5733185,comment,5732839,5733121,15,0,mseebach,,,"Don't worry. My comment got more upvotes than it deserves.<p>First point, HN is not academia, it's (mostly) intelligent people discussing interesting subjects. In such discussions, it's perfectly fine to make contributions that you can't immediately source. It's, of course, also fine to contest those, and if someone says you're wrong, and has sources, well, you should be prepared to concede the point. But even in academia, I strongly doubt that you've ever received a request for sources from a perfect stranger that didn't explain exactly which point they were interested in.<p>Second point, form and style <i>is</i> important. Politeness is important. They are cornerstones of civil discourse. If we don't maintain a civil environment, intelligent people leave, and HN turns into the regular echo chamber that are par for the course on the Internet. Intelligent people interested in real discourse can and should explain their request when asking someone else to elaborate.<p>Third point - yes, I could guess at a range of possible motivations, but I don't actually know which one it is. The range goes from ""I think you're wrong and probably an idiot, but I'm not going to bother explaining why"" to ""wow, that's a fascinating thought, where I can learn more"". Those are vastly different responses - one obviously has no place in civil discourse. My gut feeling is that one word requests for sources are more often towards the former than the latter, but obviously I can't know. Even if my gut feeling is wrong, it still creates grating uncertainly: Is this person a troll who's out to undermine my credibility on the cheap, or is it a genuinely interested person who just want to learn more.",1368978613

Instead of advertising to the public, act as a spamfilter for the public.  Its about the same tech, but a different customer base.<p>I think $10 week might be pushing it, but I'd spend $10 a month for a social media spamfilter that just passes important stuff on to me.  May as well aggregate twitter and FB and G+ and all that into one ""relevant"" feed for me.<p>For example I want to know if someone important to me dies, gets married, publishes a new book, major life change or illness, that's pretty much it.  I don't want to hear about idiotic memes, cat pix, bible verses, political spam, sports, bragging about vacations, pop culture (perhaps with certain exceptions).<p>For about six months I tried to track/log what I got out of facebook vs what it cost.  Its fairly expensive, roughly between a prime time TV show addiction and a daily soap opera addiction.  I didn't get very much out of it, and nothing that improved my life long term, but it was extremely expensive, like 20-30 hours invested per ""important"" thing.  I'd pay for a decent filter.  G+ had a better rate of return and higher actual information flow rate, although it depends what you're looking for...<p>I think you could automate this pretty well.  How hard is it to rub posts up against every version of the bible and tag anything that matches 95+ %?  How hard is it to rub all the picture up against some stock cat photos and tag 95%+ match as ""cat photo"".  Ditto some other pointless stuff, like any post with sports teams, players, and some random digits is spam.  Anything that looks/smells like a news story from any source on news.google.com, tag it I already read it.  Here's a OPML of all the RSS feeds I read, you can assume I read everything in that feed, anyone reposting the news I already heard about, just squelch it so I don't have to see the same thing 10 times.  Filter all that garbage.  On the other hand ""I'm getting married next March"" well OK pass that one along to me, its probably actually important.<p>I lived a long time without social media, and ""missed posts"" already have elaborate social procedures around them, so false positive filtering is probably a (edited: smaller) problem than false negative filtering of spam.<p>If no one has started selling this as a product, I'm not sure why (maybe the platforms would be furious at the advertising blocking nature of it?).<p>What happens when two people on social media collide who both use an ""agent"" or ""assistant"" service like this is probably a big problem.

giving factories 'self responsiblity' allowing the german war economy to reach peak output in 1944.

Forgetting that this is a cartoon and that is an actual documentary (with quotes from screen writers) the common theme (it's a really good watch btw) is that those in charge simply ""don't get it"" and are somehow oppressive and total dicks to the screenwriters and have martini lunches everyday.<p>As if the people in charge, ""Hollywood"", don't have their ass on the line and were somehow chosen by lottery to decide who succeeds and who fails. And that they have absolutely no clue at all about what they are doing in their jobs.<p>Yet, people have managed to get beyond that in Hollywood and succeed in that business. Why is that? Perhaps because they are able to work harder and work within the system (no matter how they personally feel about it) or perhaps because their ideas really are better. (Or maybe they slept with the right person?) Who cares? That's the way the world works. You only need one VC (or angel) to get you funded (if that is what you want that is).

5733026,comment,5732472,5732764,15,0,whopa,,,"So I heard a bit differently about the FB Chat thing. Facebook likes to move its engineers around to different teams from time to time (if only temporarily) to spread institutional knowledge around and prevent bus factors from being too low. This also is a way to alleviate burnout. There simply weren't enough engineers at FB who knew Erlang to make this practical for chat, so they rewrote it in C++. The Erlang bits were reasonably written and working fine, but it didn't fit into this policy. Any non-mainstream languages wouldn't fit, this isn't something about Erlang in particular.<p>Erlang is a great fit for a number of problem domains, but if you silo it into a small part of your organization, you're going to run into issues such as these. You have to be willing to train people in it. It isn't that hard to pick up if it's someone's full time job to do so, as long as they're smart. And you want to hire smart people anyway, right?",1368975884

The adversarial type of discussion we see here would be far less effective without threads.<p>For hackers, this makes perfect sense since every ""fork"", if you will, needs to be followed to the conclusion of its job. Threads ensure ancillary points are confirmed, refuted, altered or somehow interacted with.<p>Likewise, having the reply form page show the parent's message content ensures quick reference to the points (quoting, another hacker favorite, becomes easier).<p>In a way, the layout and functionality of a CMS is communication feng-shui.",1368975868

You guys are great.<p>To your question, yes I am currently testing some ideas for a magic ranking system. One option is as you say a kind of random select amounts popular or trending links. Another is a smart weighted sort when filtering by multiple tags. One problem is that right now if you add jQuery to your filter, the javascript results are going to just dominate everything else.",1368975838

Since his layoffs I've had a bit of a more dour opinion of him, as it seemed opportunistic, and he does tend to jetset quite often.<p>That said, I hope he does well. I can't see the value in what he does, but then I'm not likely his target market (though I certainly tried Seesmic, and tried to like it). And I haven't a clue as to where the revenue stream was supposed to materialize (product placement? Brand communication channel?) But as an entrepreneur, I would hate to see him fail badly, as you put it - his family is here, he's put a lot of effort, etc.<p>Although I suppose you didn't explicitly state that you take pleasure in watching another who's risked quite a bit fail spectacularly, I thought I might just drop my two cents.",1228989287

On the other hand, the Chevrolet Volt concept seems really good to me. It would also provide incremdntal incentives for building charging infrastructure that would pave the way for purely electric vehicles - it can solve the chicken and egg problem there.",1228988501

I'm getting tired of slides with huge text and no design. Makes me almost miss bullet point monotony!",1228988447

394163,comment,392460,393841,0,0,Tichy,,,"No, I don't think it is like that. I don't think the models give the wrong results, rather, they would model the climate with and without human influence and compare the results. They can see a deviation from the temperatures that would have to be expected without human influences.<p>As for falsification, obviously they don't have a second earth to experiment with. What they do is try to gather as much historical data as possible (for example by drilling into the ice of the poles), and test their models on that.<p>Or so I suppose - I am not a climatologist. Are you?<p>Of course models can be wrong, we are always just talking likelihoods... But what makes you so sure that they are wrong?",1228988163

Each were the basis for the course I took on the topic, and recieved pretty good reviews on Amazon:<p>Karel Hrbacek and Thomas Jech, Introduction to Set Theory. ISBN-13: 978-0824779153.<p>Herbert Enderton, A Mathematical Introduction to Logic. ISBN-13: 978-0122384523.<p>Hope this helps. :-)",1228987630
394159,comment,393180,393524,0,0,metaguri,,,"Indeed. I think there are a lot of ""ex-bankers"" in the world, especially now. I am an ex-banker as well and was driven to the edge by my BlackBerry going off at 10:00 every Saturday night with more ""urgent"" work to do. How on earth could this be urgent? I eventually realized that to the bankers above me, it was urgent because they loved what they did. I sincerely think that many did. On the other hand, some had workaholism, which is a whole other [sad] issue. For me, it was unnecessary stress--I didn't feel that the tasks were so important that I needed to grab a cab to the office and update those powerpoint slides as fast as humanly possible.<p>I'm in agreement with several others on this page that finding your calling, although necessarily resulting in a sacrifice of many extracurriculars, is superior. But it's very difficult. In the meantime, living a balanced life with enjoyable time spent outside of work is critical. If you're killing yourself for something that means nothing to you, you're wasting significant chunks of your very limited stint on this planet.<p>Interestingly, I re-read the ""Smart, and Gets Things Done"" and ""Done, and Gets Things Smart"" articles today, and was thinking about how these map to some of these people that I work with. To my eyes, these sorts of people fit squarely in the category of those who have found their calling, and that calling is to crank out good software 24x7. They are so excited by cranking out good code that they are propelled to do it nonstop. Coding is an intellectual, creative process, and you can't just force it to happen with a high salary or stock options; it comes from an internal drive, a desire to get all that code that's trapped inside out into the world.<p>To me that is the mechanical result of finding your calling: you're so invested and interested in something that you can't find enough time in the day to work on it, to develop it, and to get it out to the world. When I think of people like this I see artists, writers, academics--people who work tirelessly to show their passions to the world, perhaps even trying to cast out the inner demons that torment them.<p>Interesting, semi-obvious, yet mandatory observation: I have not found this yet, considering that I'm posting on HN.",1228987523

Jumped on ringtones or whatnot. Social networking sites. & all the rest.<p>Sure the end of copyright is hurting them. But they seem better off the say music studios. At least they're not acting like the world owes them a new business model.",1228986924

I have always felt that considering application design from a game design perspective might yield interesting/valuable results. In this case, I think the advice to prototype many features and invest in the best is good advice. A sort of ""discard features early and often"".",1228986758

394148,comment,393904,394097,0,0,eworoshow,,,"I think your comment is right on the mark. The cycle you describe paints an unfortunately accurate picture of many of my high school and university years. I derived not just self esteem but much of my identity from having people perceive me as smart. I learned early on that people don't readily equate perky with intelligent so I dampened my enthusiasm for, well, effectively everything. Loneliness, too, played a role. Being ""the smart one"" shut me out of a lot of social situations which fed into my depression. But the exclusion also fueled my image of intelligence. I'm sure you can see how this situation has vicious cycle written all over it.<p>Thankfully I can write about this in the past tense. What changed? I moved to San Francisco for four months for an internship. I didn't know a single person in the city and used the opportunity to forge a new identity. Day after day, person after person, I would try a new Eric. I pretended, on various occasions, to be a cook, a banker, a mechanical engineer, a park ranger, any number of other professions. And, funny thing, I was happiest just being me. When I moved back to finish my degree I was happier than I had ever been. So it all came down to a change of scenery!",1228986090

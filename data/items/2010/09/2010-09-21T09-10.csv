1712026,comment,1711171,1712002,0,0,Maro,,,"Problem is your first Uni. degree is free for Hungarian citizens, so everybody wants to get in, after all it beats getting a job. And the gov't goes along with it, because it temporarily decreases unemployment. However, this decrease in quality of incoming students led to quality of education going down at most places, and completely bogus management/administration majors gaining popularity. As a result, now virtually everybody younger than 30 has a Uni. degree, but most degrees aren't worth the paper they're printed on, as the people holding have little real-world or even theoretical skills --- eventually they become secreteries or HR people. That's why many smart people, once they figure this out, pay and do a second degree at one of the few places that's not affected by this phenomenon, like me doing the Physics major. Fortunately Physics is scary to most people, so it's one of the last remaining oasis in our education system.",1285063080

1712024,comment,1711470,1711470,0,0,ju2tin,,,"Lost in the bashing of this professor who had the temerity not to want to pay higher taxes, is the fact that he had to invest lots of money to be able to earn his big salary.  He probably has at least 7 years of higher education.  His wife, as a medical doctor, probably has at least 8, if I understand correctly how med school and internships work.  They sank a huge amount of money -- maybe close to $500,000 -- into investing in their careers, while most people in the lower income brackets have spent little, if anything, in that way.  And the cost to the professor and his wife is even greater if you factor in the opportunity cost of not working high-paying jobs all those years they were in school.  Call it a cool million sunk into their education and training, easily.<p>So it's hardly greedy of the guy to want to be able to at least pay back his wife's student loans before Obama hits him up even harder to help finance a new era of government expansion.  There's a difference between revenue and profits, after all.<p>As for saying he shouldn't have bought a million-dollar house, that's hardly an unreasonable price for a couple with a combined annual income of roughly half that amount.  As a multiple of their income, it's comparable to a couple who makes $125,000 a year buying a house worth $250,000.  That doesn't sound so crazy, does it?",1285063031

In my experience doctors tend to check symptoms and form a matrix in their head of possible causes, applicable medication,  removing medications that conflict with each other and just give you the whole remaining set.  You'll be paying for all that medication, btw.  If it works, they can't know for sure what it was or what fixed it.  If it doesn't you enter round two, a subset of the previously excluded meds.  Get out your wallet again.<p>>Also, room/board isn't free for students. They generally take loans.<p>Is this new?

Why should people be required to adjust the height of their fences to protect themselves from Google's view? Just because there are no laws against this yet, doens't mean Google has a right.<p>Second, even if they have the right to make the photos, do they also have the right to automatically make them public? There's no human judgement involved, so who's responsible when Google camera catches you naked while sun-bathing in your own garden? Who can be sued for taking these images down and who's paying for the damage that is created while the photos were online?<p>Third, do the have the right to connect the photos with street addresss so the views are searchable? This decreases search costs and your home will be public not just to bypassers, but to anyone. Who said, they are allowded to do that?<p>And this is the point: They asked noone but just though they could act as if they are free do however they please.

Pulling gedit through and ssh session is at best problematic, most cases there won't be an X client on the other side. You (almost) always find some kind of vi/vim there though.<p>There are all those nice things you can do that are really use case specific, like live editing files through ftp, scripting various things that you regularly do, adapting the config file, etc..<p>But it's not a question of ""months"". Really, vim has a very steep learning curve and you have to use it on a regular basis so it gets entrenched in you. Think more about ""years"". But that's cool, there is always more to learn, tweak and optimize.",1285060329
1711955,comment,1711171,1711171,0,0,Maro,,,"I'm Hungarian. Due to my parents, I attended schools in 3 different countries:<p>- first half year : Hungary<p>- grades 1.5 - 4 : Germany<p>- grades 5 - 8 : Hungary<p>- grades 9 - 12 : USA, California<p>- Universities, PhD: Hungary<p>After the first half year in Hungary, when I arrived in Germany, I was waaay ahead of all the other kids in Math & Sciences and was near the top of the class for most of the 4 years without speaking the language properly.<p>Then I got back to Hungary, where I had major catching up to do, especially in terms of Math, Sciences, Music and of course Hungarian language. I eventually caught up in Math & Physics, but not in Biology or Music, which never interested me much. (I mention Music because Hungarian schools teach music at a high level from grade 1 to everyone according to the ""Liszt system"", and for someone like me, who is not musically minded it was impossible to catch up.)<p>Then I went to University High School in Irvine, Orange County, California, one of the best public high schools in the USA I believe. Even so, that was a fairly shocking experience for me. Initially I was way ahead, but the whole system was so different, neither I not my parents knew how it worked (eg. you have to pick your own classes), the advisors put me into idiotic ""English as a Second Language"" classes for the first few months, where you really can't actually learn English because all the other kids are Korean. And for some reason they only had ESL for low-level math classes, roughly at the level you'd learn in 6th grade everywhere else. So eventually I did okay at UHS, because we figured out to ignore what the advisors (who seemed completely useless to me) say. But I couldn't really cope with all the freedom, all the activities, or the fact that everybody had cars at age 16, and I didn't, so I got Bs regularly.<p>Then I got back to a Hungarian University for a CS major, and even though I took all the AP classes in the US and took some CS at the local community college and UCI, I was waaaaaaaaaay behind, esp. in Physics. The AP Calculus classes are not so bad, but the one year AP Physics class is a major joke. In Hungary they study Physics for 4 years straight. So at first I had really bad grades at University. Eventually I went on to do a 2nd degree (another 5 manyears) in Physics, mostly because it interested me and I was so annoyed by my lack of understanding.<p>Overall, it's clear that the US public HS, even one of the best, was a major waste of time. I didn't learn much, nor were the teachers any good. I eventually enrolled to become a physicist to properly repair the ""damage"" caused by a lack of proper Physics education at the HS. It quickly turned out I'm so interested in Physical theories that I'm currently doing a PhD.<p>I'm also fairly certain that I got a better University education here in Hungary (esp. Physics) than I would have gotten at a public University in the US, all things taken into account. However, it's clear that no University in any part of the world can compete with top US and UK schools (mostly private and some public like Berkeley).<p>Overall, I'm still very happy to have spent 4 years in the USA, as it was a major life experience, and I benefit from it every day. I would say it was worth it even though the HS sucked, because the US culture / language is like Rome was 2000 years ago. The United States is the center of the world, and if somebody doesn't understand the United States, they don't understand the world. To get a better feeling for the ""center of the world"" part, visit the NASA museum in Washington. Everything worth mentioning that has happened after 1940 is there.<p>Also, the preview of this film seems to discount the self-confidence issue. I can understand this, but the makers should visit a country where kids, and thus people, are not injected with such self-confidence and see how they're doing (like here in Hungary). US self-confidence is one of the major factors why the economy is so great and why you have so many startups. I'm doing a startup right now, and it's no question that it's because after having spent 4 years in California I have a ""can do"" attitude, completely off the charts compared to my peers here in Hungary. I remember when I was at Uni I overheard someone referring to me as the ""American guy"" and I asked him how he knew I spent time in the States: he replied he didn't, he just gave me that nickname based on my attitude.",1285060213

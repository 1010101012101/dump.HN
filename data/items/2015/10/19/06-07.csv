You should be able to install new packages for your local user without sudo and without affecting other packages. If the system tools weren&#x27;t so lacking, I doubt we&#x27;d have the proliferation of language-specific packaging systems.<p>If they were better designed, you could simply tell debian users to install rpm to handle their rust packages, like you now tell them to install cargo. That sounds ridiculous, but it shouldn&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m hoping Nix, Guix or something of that sort can one day fill that role. Integrate them nicely into distros and let them slowly take over the non-system packages. Let rpm and dpkg slowly wither away until finally, with a little &quot;pop&quot;, they disappear into nothingness.<p>Of course, all these language-specific package managers support Windows, so I hope Nix and/or Guix actually do so. As git has shown, it doesn&#x27;t even have to be amazing support. But, without something basic, people are going to keep inventing new package managers to make Windows work.<p>Will you kill off all other package managers? Obviously not, but I do think you could prevent quite a few people from re-inventing the wheel for their next language if there was already a good tool to build upon.",1445237981

But it also couldn’t extinguish demand for the system simply by declaring that it wasn’t going to sell or support it anymore, an announcement it made in 2005. In 2012, OS/2 is invisible to the naked eye, but it’s still out there, in more places than you’d think.<p>> In New York City’s subway system, for instance, the travelers who gain entrance by swiping their MetroCards over 5 million times each weekday do so with the assistance of IBM’s theoretically defunct software. “While OS/2 is not running any visible part of the system, it does serve an essential purpose, and there are hundreds of OS/2 computers in service,” says Neil Waldhauer, a consultant who helps New York City Transit and other clients keep their OS/2 applications running.<p>> “OS/2 is not a superior solution in the places where it is still in use,” he explains. “Rather, it is a vital part of a larger system. Many enterprises have big investments in OS/2 programs that have no equivalent on other operating system … For many users, it would be expensive or inconvenient to move years or decades of their data and programs to a new platform. Replacing OS/2 would mean replacing their entire system.”",1445237559

Memory performance is getting higher in the same way that processor performance is going up:<p><a href=""http://www.corsair.com/en-us/blog/2015/september/ddr3_vs_ddr4_generational"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.corsair.com/en-us/blog/2015/september/ddr3_vs_ddr...</a><p>Latency is to frequency as bandwidth is to parallelism.   Single core CPU frequencies are relatively stable, but parallelism offers the opportunity to get more done each cycle.  Latency for random access is holding quite steady, but caches are getting bigger and faster, and bandwidth is going up.<p>The key is figuring out how to write software that takes advantage of spatial locality and available bandwidth rather than getting choked by the latency.  This is hard in the same way that taking advantage of multiple cores is hard:  it requires a different approach, but is not a fundamental limitation.<p>Lots of memory access isn&#x27;t the problem.  Long latency isn&#x27;t the problem.  The problem is designing your program so that it generates lots of long latency memory accesses and then grinds to a halt in the presence of this latency.  I think the summary from this recent paper is spot on:<p><pre><code>  Our conclusion is contrary to our expectations and to   \n  previous findings and goes against conventional wisdom, \n  which states that accesses to RAM are slow, and should be \n  minimized.

Hence, it is hard to imagine that anything that would found in this notebook would be of particular theological relevance to almost anyone.<p>That said, if someone were to find a similar notebook for a &quot;mainstream&quot; book, it would still be of only minor consequence.<p>Even within strongly evangelical protestant churches, there is not a lot of specific <i>theological</i> reverence for the King James Bible. It was a remarkable achievement and did a lot to aid in the accessibility and spread of the bible in Western Europe and the colonies, but it is - in most churches - viewed as simply another translation. It was done by good people with the best of intentions, using the best manuscripts and technique available to them at the time, but that does not make it perfect, nor does it make it &quot;scripture&quot; in a way that another translation isn&#x27;t.<p>We know what source material they used, and we know what they produced as output. These notebooks help understand the process by which they did that, but that&#x27;s more of historical interest than anything else.<p>Plenty of people have undertaken the process of comparing the source material with the KJV output, so that the christian church is well aware of the relative strengths and weaknesses of that translation.<p>It is discovery of early source material that has the potential to cause ripples in modern christian theology - the discovery of the dead sea scrolls had a far bigger impact on modern bible translations than any KJV notebooks ever could.<p>There are a small number of Christian churches who believe that the KJV is &quot;the true bible&quot;. If we found that the draft versions of the bible were greatly different than the final version, that might cause some angst for them, but generally their views are based on a form of the idea that &quot;God protected his church by providing this bible translation&quot; so they would simply accept that God was at working directing the translators to reject the draft version and accept the final version.",1445236385

But it is my advice that one hopefully outgrow the easier version as quick as possible.<p>The KJV authors were genuine people as well. They were not bent on making a name for themselves which is what the basis for every modern translation is (other than money).<p>I disagree that new translations are somehow &quot;more accurate&quot;. From a handful of older manuscripts, that disagree not only with the originals used in the KJV but they also disagree amongst themselves, we get a hodgepodge of missing sentence fragments, and re-wordings that for what ever reason where backported into the Nestle greek from which most modern translations are derived.

It was the complete opposite; lead by secularists and skeptics alike who&#x27;s only goal seemed to be how many verses they could get away with removing. Verses were never added, only removed.<p>In the end, there was no reason for the Christian community to be involved in this.

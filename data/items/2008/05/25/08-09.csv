I can ask Google to get me all kinds of information, and it just appears. Even 15 years ago some fairly trivial Google searches would have required privileged access to sources of knowledge (libraries, universities, etc... stuff not always available everywhere in the world) and lots of free time.<p>There are very few limits (or if there are, we haven't reached them yet) on the reproducibility of information. The marginal cost of reproducing information for another ten or twenty billion human beings is fairly negligible. Will it ever be the case that we can overcome the limits on the reproducibility of material goods? Or are there fundamental constraints on material goods that don't exist for information? If we can overcome them, then one day we will all be ""billionaires"", in this sense.<p>EDIT: Amazon Web Services is a good example of this kind of transformation; it's made all of us ""millionaires"" when it comes to computing. A few years ago, ""get me a thousand servers"" would have required millions of dollars, a fair amount of time, and a lot of technical expertise. With EC2, it requires $100/hr.",1211705461

199442,comment,199279,199320,0,0,maxklein,,,"This is a classic case of the harm that not lying to your children can cause. The things my parents told me when I was young shaped a large part of my world view. If you were a racist, enough of that would seep through to influence your child. If you tried to explain bell curves and so on, and you believed that white people were more clever than black people, your child would grasp the subtext of what you are saying.<p>The best thing to do is to not pre-infect your child with your own personal notions on controversial topics till he is equipped to think independently about them.",1211705248
199441,comment,199279,199416,0,0,maxklein,,,"Yes, but the wisdom of thousands of years of human cultural evolution as well as our instincts tell us not to do this. If it worked in one case that is no reason to also do it.<p>My dad recently told a story about how he got scammed out of practically all his heavy machinery when I was 8 years old. He was completely broke, his machines were in another town, the scammer had run off and he had no means of earning money without transporting his machines back. But he had no money to do this. So for 6 months, he ran around trying to borrow money so he could transport the machines back and start earning money.<p>I remember when the machines were gone. But I did not associate it with anything, I thought they were out on a job. If my Dad had told me that he had been scammed, and the machines were stuck and he had no income, and that debts were piling up every single day, I would have understood the problem, and to god, that would have been the most terrible thing that I could have imagined.<p>I would have wondered how someone could scam my dad. I would have come up with ways of trying to get the machines home. I would have worried that we would become poor.<p>Knowing that information would have been a terrible thing for me to know as an 8 year old, exactly because I would have understood what it meant. If any one of you claims that telling an 8 year old that type of stuff is good for the child, then you are damn idiots who have no place raising a child.<p>For me as a child, lightning was already very scary, even though I understood how unlikely it was to happen. Compare an event like my father losing his money to something abstract and unlikely to lightning, and you understand by how much more it would have worried me.<p>Anyone who advocates telling children that type of information is completely unfit to raise children.",1211704753

199435,comment,199421,199421,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"I do not know what is technically possible, but I am absolutely sure that to say Google will remain the All Mighty of Search is similar to saying "" Hey, I am short sighted"". Search is painful and will ultimately die and give its place to something else. Think Ford's automobile vs ""faster horses"".\nIn the short term, Input will change from text to voice.\nIn the long term Search will give place to Suggestions and Decisions. Sort of like a game. Machines will have so much data about ourselves thru Facebook, Disqus (and the multiple other places where you exist) and become intelligent to the point where they will be able to predict our behavior and make suggestions. Example: Xobni will read that you want to go to Paris in June with your girlfriend and suggest deals on a daily basis. Google is already doing it with Gmail and it proves that Search is truly archaic and the innovators should focus on the power of suggestion.",1211704035

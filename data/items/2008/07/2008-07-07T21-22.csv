239237,comment,238325,238339,0,0,LPTS,,,"You should read a book called The Genesis of Artistic Creativity, by Michael Fitzgerald.  The thing that you are talking about that many great hackers and painters have in common is a high functioning subtype of aspergers syndrome.  The personality traits and drive to create you admire are manifestations of an ""Autistic Superego"" outlined by Fitzgerald in his book.<p>Thinking in images is a skill that relies on a mechanical-mathematical mind.  In painters, they use this skill to paint, in hackers, they use it to architect complicated systems which they hold in their heads while they code.  In both these cases, it's the same neurological mechanism underlying the ability you admire.<p>Your insight that painters and hackers is fundementally correct, and also deeper then 98% of what I have read about the hacker culture.  If you want to explore it deeper, from a psychological and sociological point of view, reading Fitzgerald's book is the place to start.",1215467924

239229,comment,238544,239167,0,0,akeefer,,,"Indeed, there's a real tension there between treating test as ""real"" code and letting them be separate.  You end up getting bitten both ways, and we've gotten hit by all of them.  Things can't all work the same, since if TestA and TestB share a common setup routine or helper and TestC comes along and needs to tweak that, you don't want it to hose TestA and TestB.  On the other hand, if you have 1 production implementation of some interface and 50 different test mocks, you're in huge trouble if you need to change that interface, and life will be better if the tests either use the real implementation or all share a single mock (though even then there's a danger in the mock diverging from the main interface).<p>There's a similar problem with tests using their own code paths to set things up instead of the normal system path.  For example, suppose you're testing a method that takes a User object.  In your production system, users might only be created in a certain way, they might have certain fields required, they might have sub-objects attached to them, the database might enforce nullability or fk constraints, there might be insert callbacks in the code or in the DB, etc.  If you try to just hack up a User in memory and pass it to the test method outside of the normal creation path, your test User object might differ in important ways from your actual User objects in production.  So changes in the production code, for example assuming a field isn't null or relying on a default value, might cause the tests to break erroneously even though the app is fine.  Then you have to find all the places you create Users in tests and fix them, or try to centralize things so you only have to fix them in one place.<p>Some of those problems can be partially avoided by proper decomposition and decoupling of the code, though oftentimes you have to have the foresight to do that before the tests get out of hand (and having the tests get out of hand is a good canary in the coal mine that your code is in trouble).<p>We actually went all the way to one extreme whereby we run our tests in the production environment as much as we can and avoid mocks and stubs; we're a Java servlet app (kinda the only way to do enterprise software these days, unfortunately), so we start up a Jetty server, an H2 database in memory, and go through the normal server-startup sequence before running most unit tests, which at least eliminates the test setup problem and a lot of the test/production divergence.  It comes at a huge cost in terms of local test execution times, unfortunately.",1215467556

We have been looking at nearly 1/6th of the population of the world controlled by an incredibly repressive regime and most of their citizens aren't even aware of how restricted they are.<p>I also look at this from the perspective of an engineer. How in the history of the world did we ever get to a point where it was cheaper to ship parts from the U.S. to China for assembly and then back to the U.S. than to do all of the manufacture here at home? The shear amount of energy that has been expended has been ridiculous.<p>All of the cheap cash inflow into China has fueled the massive growth of very inefficient coal plants throughout the country by the thousands. The people in China have energy needs, but because of the disregard and corruption of the government they have been polluting themselves in the headlong rush to catch up to the Western world.<p>The system of global trade that has emerged over the last 20-30 years is an extremely inefficient system that needs to undergo some serious refactoring.

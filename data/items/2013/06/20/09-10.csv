After creating your secret key(s), you move them to the card (or you can create the key inside the card, so it is never seen by your PC). The card has no capability of exporting them so they will never be leaked. You can only wipe the card clean and start over. To further protect your PIN-code for the card, you can use a card reader with integrated keypad, which should work against most key-loggers.<p>For GPG you most certainly can invalidate a key, in fact, this is a crucial part of the key-generation and management process. Along with the public/private key pair, you also generate a key revocation certificate. The revocation cert can then be uploaded to the key-server in the case that your key gets compromised. A well behaving GPG-client will check the validity of the public keys in your key chain, and if it encounters a revocation key against the public key you are trying to use, it will then disable it and warn you.<p>For more, see: <a href=""http://g10code.com/p-card.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://g10code.com/p-card.html</a> and <a href=""https://www.crypto-stick.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.crypto-stick.com/</a>",1371722385

There will be massive shortages of available bus space. With a paid system, people are forced to economize--do I really need to pay to take the bus in winter 5 blocks to buy groceries, or can I walk? But if it&#x27;s &quot;Free,&quot; then people will not economize. The people who need the bus the most, to go to work or hospital or whatever, will have to compete for limited space with people who don&#x27;t need to be taking the bus.<p>This is a popular theory with certain economists but has not been borne out by experiment. E.g. my country introduced pricing for prescription drugs (previously free) based on exactly that reasoning. Turns out overall usage barely changed (the very poorest stopped taking their prescriptions because they couldn&#x27;t afford them, but they&#x27;re a relatively small proportion of society) and administering the payment system cost far more than the money saved in reduced usage or collected in fees.",1371718899

And I can't see that Porsche was fixing the price of VW stock; they were apparently doing little or no selling so the price must have been set by other traders.",1225958145

That's the gist of my comment.</i><p>I've already answered that in a manner that I'm confident makes sense in America: Because he <i>is</i> black.  By the definition of the people for whom it matters, the color of his skin tells them all they need to know.  Whether he has ""white"" relatives (whatever ""white"" means, since a large percentage of white folks have non-white ancestry, of some sort), or not, is irrelevant to a racist.  It doesn't matter to folks who don't care about race; it matters no more whether he is black, half-black, one-quarter black, mocha-latte-frappucino brown, or plain old white of the purist driven snow.  To the people for whom it matters, though, ""half-black"" is like saying ""half-virgin"" or ""half-pregnant"".  To them, a black man has been elected president.  And this is what many black folks have grown up believing was impossible...because there <i>is</i> a real history of racism in this country.  As a nation, it has dramatically improved over the past four generations.<p>I still don't understand why you think it is some great truth that should be trumpeted from the rooftops that Obama is <i>merely</i> half black.  It's not a secret that he has mixed race parents, and never has been.  Nonetheless, his skin is brown.  If racism was going to hold a black man back, it would have held him back just as well as it would hold any other brown-skinned man or woman back.  And...it didn't hold him back.",1225958106

Worse yet, the film absolutely killed the best parts of the plot.<p>However I was yet another turned off by Timeline.  It was the next book of Crichton's that I read after JP2, and I was seriously disappointed...  I don't remember the details now, but there were several glaring flaws in the logic of the story, not to mention some of the stuff about language just seemed so far fetched to me.<p>Still, there can be no doubt that Crichton was a very talented man.  His contributions to our culture will be missed.",1225957591

Why have actual growth charts that might be depressing, when you can just make up your own and be happy?<p>They've put more effort into their modeling tool than some startups put into their successful products. If they were an agile little startup it might be really smart to turn the company into a Growth Forecasting service.

28282,comment,27864,27975,0,0,staunch,,,"Some people go so far as ""unschooling"". Lots of stuff on the web about it. Basically allowing children to learn whatever interests them whenever they want. I would absolutely do this with my children. Unless they weren't too bright, then I'd send them to public school and they'd enjoy it.

We really need them to just get the US laws on this stuff clarified and stable.<p>It reminds me of PayPal's fraud issues. Very similar kind of risk management issue. Google should buy Slide just to get Max Levchin working on YouTube.<p>Like credit card processing maybe every company could have a  ""charge back ratio"" type number that was regulated by a neutral third party. If more than 2% of your videos are infringing you get shutdown. I know there's a million reason that won't happen, but I think something like that might work. Infringement on a small scale is acceptable by all parties, it's the NFL outtakes with 1.5 million views that piss people off.

28280,comment,28176,28210,0,0,staunch,,,"Most programmers don't know how to develop software very well. You shouldn't be surprised ""biz guys"" are totally ignorant. Most non-programmers think you can have marketing and design people come up with ""specs"" and then hand it off to have it ""programmed"". That almost never works and yet it's by far the most common method. People who think this is a good practice should be no where near the helm of a technology company.<p>Some web companies are not technology companies though. I think the ""biz guy"" approach works for those -- occasionally. Digg was a cheap project on elance. The success for that site was more about a TechTV/Kevin Rose community. MySpace is similar.<p>Facebook a non-technology company becoming one.

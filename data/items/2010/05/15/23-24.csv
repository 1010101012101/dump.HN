The HTML itself is the wood, and perhaps the parser is the lathe. I think there is a false dichotomy between tools as purely functional and the product as the art. There can be real artistry in a well constructed tool. A well written, efficient parser can be beautiful to behold.<p>Maybe this comes down to the difference between something constructed purely for artistic purposes and something constructed in an artistic way to fulfill a broader purpose. Or maybe it's just a matter of personal taste, the way some people will spend hours arguing about whether a soup can is modern art or just pretentious trash. Personally, I'd say that if people are moved and/or inspired by it, than you can make the case that it is art.",1273967480

This is art.<p>An HTML parser requires fast and efficient code to successfully and quickly read the document. Furthermore, the programmer needs to take into account common variations in HTML code as well as handling nested tags and attributes. And taking it a step further, the HTML parser is used to output the trillions of websites that are currently out there in a visible form for a majority of the developed world.

The three big camps are probably: 1. people who think GNU software sucks technically; 2. people who don't like the GPL; and 3. people who really dislike the FSF and/or Richard Stallman.<p>The first reason probably applies most to big projects like gcc, where it's alleged that the FSF's development process has led to un-modular,  hard-to-maintain software. But there are some differences on smaller projects as well, where the BSDs have a tendency to prefer more use of libraries with command-line apps as front-ends to the libs, while the FSF prefers self-contained command-line utilities that interact in the traditional Unix piping style. E.g. GNU tar and GNU gzip are mostly self-contained utilities, while the BSD versions have all the real code in libarchive and zlib, with some command-line frontends.<p>Some of the more minor rewrites I assume are due to licensing or personality/political issues (I doubt technical reasons are what lay behind OpenBSD writing GNU bc/dc workalikes).",1273967024

Just like with Java, Python passes only values. The value can be a reference to an object sometimes - that's pretty much it. Just like with Java, the call-by-whatever is sometimes misunderstood. It never behaves like call-by-reference. You can never do:<p><pre><code>    def a(x):\n      x = 42\n</code></pre>\nand expect the value of `y` in your local scope to be changed after `a(y)`.<p>I'd rather agree with the way Java defines it - call by value.<p>Wikipedia: <i>However, the term ""call by sharing"" is not in common use; the terminology is inconsistent across different sources. For example, in the Java community, they say that Java is pass-by-value, whereas in the Ruby community, they say that Ruby is pass-by-reference, even though the two languages exhibit the same semantics.</i>",1273966930

1350890,comment,1350583,1350849,0,0,davidalln,,,"I think dismissing ""programming as art"" as irrelevant and hurtful to the community is dangerous. Here we have the tools to create a near-infinite amount of almost everything that can run on a computer. We use code to run complicated robots that can drive a course without human input, solve the most complicated mathematic problems of today, and create artificial intelligence with the ability to learn as it ages. Yet at the same time, we use code to make short chiptune songs and fun small games hacked away in an hour or two.<p>Wikipedia defines art as ""the product of deliberately arranging elements in a way to affect the senses or emotions"", and science as ""the systematic enterprise of gathering knowledge about the world and organizing and condensing that knowledge into testable laws and theories."" Why do these two things have to be mutually exclusive? Through creation and exploring, such as in _why's projects, we are further ""gathering knowledge"" about the limits computers can be used. And at the same time, we are creating art as these programs have had a clear impact on at least the Ruby community.<p>And, bringing up a more ""sciencey"" example, if the fact that my handheld calculator can solve complicated algebra and calculus equations in less than a second doesn't ""affect [your] senses or emotions"", then you need a reality check on just how impressive technology has come in such a short time.<p>I personally believe that programming is one of the rawest forms of creation imaginable, and therefore must be of some artistic worth.

Face it, there's good art and bad art, and it's subjective which is which.  Programs have objective measures we can apply, depending on what the code is used for - developer time, performance, correctness...  and a million others.  We can argue about which measures are the right ones to use, but at least these measures exist.  We can (with current technology) empirically evaluate a piece of code in many different ways.

My argument is that it's pretty simple to build a good computer scientist: take a guy with good IQ and put it into a good university. But there are zero guarantees that you'll end with a good <i>coder</i> also, as coding is a matter of taste, tradeoffs, design decisions, creativity, ability to think out of the box, and so forth.<p>The problem is that most of our industry is not ready to accept this news. There was <i>no</i> so important economic process like IT in the past where creativity and art had the same impact as it is happening with programming. Check the software and the sites you are enjoying every day: are they made by great scientists? The big majority are not.<p>But at the same time, the reverse is true. If you have good scientists you can create any complex program or system without problems.

But this is an engineering problem indeed, so it is a perfect fit for them.<p>But not everything is like that in our field.

I'm with the majority in HNers in this thread so far, still in awe of _why, however, let's not forget the tough lessons his disappearance taught us.<p>While I greatly appreciated everything _why did for the community and think he truly was an amazing person, it's clear in my mind that the way he left the community, without notice that he would take down his sites and code, was irresponsible. He had the right to do what he did, but that doesn't make it ok.<p>I'm not angry at _why, more sad. I assume, given his eccentricities, that there was no malicious intent behind it, which is why I find it merely tragic. However, his leaving was a powerful reminder of the responsibilities open source software authors have. If you make code free, you should make sure it stays available within reason, and if you use free software, you should take _why's disappearance as an object lesson.",1273964923

I (and others) often suggest that the former approach is actually harmful to software quality in many cases, particularly within teams.<p>Fundamentally I think my objection is to elevating a slightly odd-ball programmer to messianic status based on a mildly creepy fandom that manifests primarily as people vastly over-stating the contributions of this one guy in HN comments.",1273964753

It takes a lot of work to extract the decent information from all of these sources (probably about 10-15% of the information I receive is any good). The obvious solution to this problem seems to be applying a learning algorithm to create a personalized feed of news items. However I know there have been a few sites which have done this in the past with little success. Can anyone suggest any reasons why they have failed? Is it the implementations or that news personalization just doesn't work?",1273964449

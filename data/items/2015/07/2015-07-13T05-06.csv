The whole reason things like healthcare are offered as benefits rather than straight salary is because benefits are tax efficient.<p>>Ultimate flexibility is what efficient economies are about. Unions don&#x27;t like that future and understandably try and fight it. It&#x27;s a futile fight in the end.<p>Sure get rid of the unions, but let employers band together in trade associations. I am sure that these employer organisations would never collude to hold down wages.<p>Edit. It is good to see that everyone here has forgotten about all the big tech companies banding together to hold down tech wages.",1436767192

Then try using C++, or D or something.  Once upon a time, I didn&#x27;t do programming contests, but some people from IRC got me to try the Code Jam.  I thought I&#x27;d use Haskell, being very familiar with it, and the experience was a most illuminating disaster.

9876531,comment,9876009,9876333,0,0,lsc,,,"So, I&#x27;ve got comments from both ends, but I think your advice is super interesting, especially from the employer-side of things.<p>>A lot of people who get laid off want to know why them and not a peer. Was their peer a better performer at the same pay grade? Or was their peer doing the same job for less money? Is the company looking to eliminate senior roles? Junior roles? Or was the selection completely random?<p>Hm.  So, as an employee, I wouldn&#x27;t believe any of those answers, were the boss to give them to me.   As someone else said, &quot;Severance... everything else is just words&quot;  -  but it is important to remember that most people are not as cynical as I am.<p>As an employer, though, that advice is interesting... because really, it seems kind of shitty to say &quot;I&#x27;m sorry bob, but it turns out that Joe is just three times more effective than you are.  I think he&#x27;s just smarter.&quot;    which is what I&#x27;d say if I really was giving the unvarnished truth.  I mean, a lot of times, there isn&#x27;t really much Bob could do about it; he&#x27;s just not as smart as Joe is; it&#x27;s not really his fault.<p>but my instinct, when I don&#x27;t know what the right thing to say, is to just tell the truth, so your advice appeals to me.   but it just seems like this is one of those &#x27;does my butt look big&#x27; situations where keeping my damnfool mouth shut is the best option.<p>Is this what you would want to hear?  How would you feel if the boss told you someone else was three times as effective as you were and you disagreed with that assessment?<p>>That way the person let go knows whether and how to adjust their performance going forward at their next job so they&#x27;re more likely to survive that company&#x27;s inevitable layoffs.<p>As an employee, I say that you always want to be in the first round of layoffs.  The severance is usually best at that point, and even if the company did a good job and fired the people who were, say, half as productive, those people did <i>some</i> work, and that work still needs to get done.  Guess who gets to do it?  You!  the &quot;Lucky&quot; person who didn&#x27;t get laid off!<p>I&#x27;ve never gotten the axe in a layoff... I&#x27;ve been fired, but that&#x27;s a different thing.    More than once I&#x27;ve ended up quitting after the first or second round of layoffs because the company expected me to work twice as hard for the same money (and no possibility of a raise) with half the support I had before.",1436764011

It is also extremely selfish, because it has nothing to do with making their situation better it has to do with you trying to selfishly overcome your own guilt.

So lets go with $.99/Month on the mobile model.<p>Unless it&#x27;s one of the endless time suck games like current mobile games, eg dudes fighting castles, or some big online multiplayer on PC you&#x27;re not really getting a multi month subscription out of it.<p>The poster boy in this thread, any mario game, is maybe 2 months, 3 in spurts. That&#x27;s 3 @ .99, 6 @ 1.99, or 9 @ 2.99. None of which gets you even close to what they were making.<p>And none of those games will hit the same scale as the dudes n castles games will because those games are simple time wasters with little barrier to entry, eg no skill required. You have to limit max players BEST CASE for your great yester year at the same for any console game, eg maybe 10M players max. If they all played for 3 months at max price your best case is 100M, but more likely 10-30M best case. And likely lower. Eg console numbers is console numbers.<p>These games cost 10M + to develop these days even great 2d ones because they&#x27;re still modelled in 3d for parts of it.

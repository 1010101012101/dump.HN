If you dont believe me just look at all of the startups they have acquired recently. If I were Apple I would be very concerned.",1192261556

I'm not applying to YC because (a) I'm a sole founder, (b) I can't move to the bay area (unless someone wants to pay my medical bills, I need to stay in Canada where things are mostly free), and (c) I'm busy leading an opera orchestra on the November 3rd/4th weekend.",1192261500

Not that that's not ok, but, although I'm sure it is very nice to get into YC, does your business idea really depend on it?<p>I'm rather torn - don't really need YC for the core biz but for sure would love to experience those famed crazy three months.<p>All the best Edward, who knows maybe we'll meet on Nov 3rd.",1192261465

I'm an applicant for this YC funding cycle, and would love to get to know some of you guys+girls.<p>I'm curious as to what market your startup/idea is in? If you feel like sharing.<p>Mine is about on-demand software/SaaS.<p>I expect all of us will be sharing more soon. I am missing community feeling on this board, hence this post to generate some introductions.<p>Really look forward to meeting you, these are exciting times.",1192261100

- really good customer service (24/7) phone support
- an out of this world web admin ui (nothing compares)
- decent pricing<p>Unfortunately I can't recommend it because in the end it's about having a reliable and relatively fast website of which MT is not known for. Even with a grid server account maxed to 1GB and a separate database instance, it's still somewhat slow (and this is when their network is not being attacked...). Their technology looks really good theoritically but in real life it just doesn't work... ",1192260250

When you find one, you do an IP Lookup to see if it originated from Boston. Then you get disappointed when you realize it's some random crawler probing your site, or worse yet, you realize it was you visiting your own site.</i><p>I must be missing something.  How could you possibly not recognize your own IP address?",1192259147
67209,comment,67187,67187,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Joyent Accelerators ( <a href=""http://www.joyent.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joyent.com</a> ) are flexible, and they're the ""official"" Ruby on Rails host.  They also happen to offer the best control panel (Virtualmin, of course).  The only negative might be that Accelerators are Solaris systems--I don't have any complaints about that, but if you're accustomed to Linux, it might be a bit of a learning curve.<p>Slicehost ( <a href=""http://www.slicehost.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slicehost.com</a> ) has a good reputation.  Their Xen systems are not over-subscribed and they know their business.<p>Media Temple (<a href=""http://www.mediatemple.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mediatemple.com</a> ) had a good reputation until recently...but I'm sure it was a temporary setback.  They're technically savvy.  They're using a kind of quirky virtualization layer (Virtuozzo) which, when over-subscribed even a little bit (and sometimes even when not), exhibits serious memory issues.<p>Gridzones ( <a href=""http://www.gridzones.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gridzones.com</a> ) is another Solaris zones based host, and they have some reasonable plans.  It's a smaller shop, so probably gives more personal service.  Tell Phil that Joe from Virtualmin sent you (I dunno if it'll get you a discount, but he'll be happy to hear from you).  They start at $15, which is hard to beat (you probably want more space than that, though...).  They're also Virtualmin friendly, when appropriate (i.e. when you have enough space/memory for full service hosting).<p>If you're wanting to spend a little more, The Planet and Server Beach both offer dedicated boxes starting at around $69, I think.  I've used both for years with very few complaints.

That's a lot of conditions.  The bigger struggle is getting the prospect to even know you exist in the first place.<p>One way to compete on price is to find something you could replicate, take their price and quadruple it.  By charging 4 times as much, you can spend a lot more on marketing. Sure you'll lose some sales to people who price shop, but that's a small part of the market.  It's possible that with four times the marketing budget you could bring in more than four times the number of customers of your competition.  I don't know.<p>This might work best where your primary value add is repackaging a scalable service that is mostly offered by others.<p>Maybe you could copy patio11's appointment reminder service, only charge four times as much.  There are a lot of businesses in the USA that take appointments... with the higher margins, maybe you can afford to send every one of them a nice packet of information.<p>The approach I take, though, is to do something original.  Even if others have done it (and others are trying what we're trying, but nobodies really been successful) I expect we'll do ok because the opportunity is huge and there aren't that many others doing it.<p>But even still, I wouldn't be doing it if I didn't think that I had a really compelling competitive advantage.  If the others weren't totally screwing up the opportunity, I'd be a lot less interested.<p>I think github is NOT screwing up their opportunity, and so that might not be a business to try and compete with... but there are lots of ideas... just find something where you can do it better than anyone else, or where you <i>think</i> you have a compelling advantage.... that would be the idea to pursue.<p>Maybe charing four times as much would give you a compelling advantage in marketing, I don't know.  But that's the kind of price competition I'd go for.... otherwise, have your own spin and then use that difference to find the part of (a preferably very large) market to get for yourself.",1315154257

The simpler you make it the more that will but the simpler it is the less useful it becomes.<p>This has several important implications.<p>- It makes local hard to scale because your audience size is that much smaller that reviews are far less reliable both in frequency and volume; and<p>- Again I'll say something I've said here repeatedly: the value of so-called ""social search"" is limited to nonexistent because most people in your circle won't review anything.<p>Secondly, businesses like Yelp risk going down the comScore route. 10 years ago comScore was <i>the</i> source for visitor numbers, which drove advertising revenue. If you paid you got accurate numbers. If you didn't, comScore ""guessed"", and for some reason those numbers always seemed low, so much so that lots complained.<p>The problem is that comScore (and now Yelp) have an economic incentive to get people to advertise such that they are not impartial and site therefore cannot be trusted.<p>It's why I think companies like Google (disclaimer: I work for Google) should stay out the content business. We're great at connecting people to things they want. If we're one of those things they want then we have at least the potential for the appearance (if not the actuality) of impropriety, at the very least.<p>I just don't see local reviews and social search going, well, anywhere, certainly anytime soon.",1315154218

Admittedly, I'm an almost entirely unproductive person lately, so I can't claim that it's because RSS is getting in the way of other things. My chief suspicion is that as the number of subscriptions goes up, the propensity to fly through headlines rises as well, and so too does the efficiency of applying whatever criteria normally applies in choosing whether or not to read past a headline. What normally would be signal gets converted to noise because of the quantity needed to be consumed. Of course, one can always lower the number of subscriptions, but on the other hand, as one approaches lower bounds, the less sense RSS makes: one can simply and probably with more aesthetic pleasure, just make rounds to the website. Another point: there's more information and more of interest in a website than what gets printed as words in an article or in the images or whatever media that accompanies that article. And this is another suspicious element of RSS readers: they divorce content from the context in which it ""originally"" appears (scare quotes because of complexity). One can learn a good lot of important stuff about a content provider by looking at that provider's website, layout, design, ad priorities, etc. And not only about that provider, but about just what the hell the web looks like these days. If all I did was read via RSS, I'd probably have no clue. And more over, if all anybody ever did was read via RSS, websites themselves would be something else entirely and that something else probably wouldn't be much to look at.<p>So really that's two chief suspicions: one, it's hard to find an optimal number of subscriptions (or even if there is such a thing); and two, RSS annihilates the experience of everything it can't contain.<p>(I said I was torn, but I think I've started to convince myself that maybe I need to ditch Google Reader...)",1315153844

At the time, it seemed the majority of the HN population embraced and welcomed this attitude.<p>(And what emotion did manifest, was more welcome for its genuineness and respectfulness.  For example, people really did celebrate each other's launches -- often in a rather informed and informing fashion.)<p>Emotion is a principal item that concerns me about the original post that started this thread.  There's too much of it.<p>I don't have a solution to HN's current situation, either.  But getting amp-ed up about it won't, I think, help.<p>Some time ago (after forgetting, for a while), I switched on show dead.  The newest/ page probably, on average, had (well) under 25% dead items.  Since then, the number of dead items on newest/ has grown to often be well over 50% of the page (over 75%, not infrequently).<p>I agree with almost all of those post kills.  It's utter crap:  Irrelevant, promotional, having nothing to do with the real (""traditional"", whatever) HN community.<p>And I see that as indicative of HN's overall situation.  It's no longer a niche market.  The world has found it, and unless the door is closed (not that I have a means to suggest of making that a solution), they will come in and picnic and litter and trod the grass until there is nothing but a mostly bare field, where one can hardly find the remaining grass for all the people standing in the way.<p>HN started as a self-selecting group.

2959659,comment,2959503,2959503,2,0,lsc,,,"Well, obviously <i>I</i> think so.  Especially in the infrastructure industry, starting with very low prices and slowly working your way up the food chain is essentially how it's done.   It's easy in the computer-infrastructure market, too;  you simply don't lower your prices as fast as moore's law lowers your hardware costs.<p>I mean, you also need to think about your market and what they care about.   It is a given, I think, that if you are breaking into an established market, you will be forced to accept lower margin than the established competition.   But some markets?  lowering the price won't help you.  In those markets, don't lower your price, but spend a larger percentage of your revenues on sales or advertising.  In some markets, like say contracting to 'enterprise' customers, it makes sense to actually charge more and give most of that to a middleman;  I've never been able to get as much money directly renting myself out as I could going through a middleman, even after you take out the middleman's cut.    Large corporations are more concerned about following the procedures than saving 50%.   On the other hand, small companies?   they'll switch providers for a 10% discount sometimes.   Individuals paying with post-tax money can be even tighter than small companies.   So know your market, and know if spending more on sales/marketing makes more sense or if firing the salesman and knocking his commission off the price will sell you more.<p>Another thing;  Even if you provide the same service as the existing player, if your prices are significantly lower, you will probably be targeting a different market.   I mean, I steal some customers from slicehost, but I think most of those are older customers who joined up when slicehost was small and cheaper.  These days, really, I doubt there is a lot of overlap between the sort of people who would consider slicehost and the sort of people who would consider me.<p>Really, I think the slicehost example is a good one;   back in the day, Slicehost was seen as the only player (marketing failure, I think, on Linode's part, mostly, if I'm remembering the timeline right.  Linode was UML a long time ago, which is really a different product, but I think Linode was Xen by the time Slicehost hit the market.  At the time, I was also selling Xen VPSs, but I was in no way a serious player.)   So, there were a lot of people on Slicehost who switched to Linode or to me as time went on, as they were individuals or small companies.<p>But large companies?  they want the big name, and barring a buyout, Linode and I can't give them that.  (Linode is earning a reputation on their own, which is great for them, and really, for me too, because they have no reason to lower their prices as fast as they would otherwise.   But they are a long ways from having the name that rackspace has.)<p>I was doing some consulting the other day for a friend who works for a very large company.  They are paying rather a lot for dog-slow OpenVZ VPSs provided by Verio.   They could have gotten a better deal almost anywhere, but they had the relationship with Verio.",1315153542

With an IDX site, one can conduct searches by city, price, property type, and other common parameters. In Newport Beach, it is one of the most popular search methods for buyers and the only advertising method approved by the National Association of Realtors (NAR) for home sellers.",1263016756
1041098,comment,1040755,1040901,0,0,jerf,,,"""On the bad side, larger demand for tests means more waiting for everybody.""<p>Absolutely false. Larger sustained demand for testing means the supply will be grown by market forces. Larger sustained demand could under some circumstances actually cut waiting for everybody if it meant being able to grow the supply past a useful economy-of-scale boundary.<p>The market is not a static entity. (At least until the government comes in and <i>makes</i> it a static entity, which I hear they're getting pretty close to. So, buck up! Soon you'll be right!)",1263016711

This whole idea of a perfect form is inane. Relational set theory gives us conceptual ways of talking about constructs. It's a tool, not a way of life. Somebody build a bad relational model? Well -- what do you mean by ""bad""? Did the resulting code achieve the goals set at the beginning?<p>And when I got to the point in the abstract where it said no books had shown how to use it well, I was ready to bail out. I'm not sure what books the author has been reading. The ones I've seen have practical real-world examples of normalization all through them.",1263016252

This is the efficiency argument.<p>Saying programmers can't walk up to 20 random new people because it's ""draining"" to them is both offensive and unfair.

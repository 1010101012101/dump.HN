46865,comment,46785,46862,0,0,chaostheory,,,"I have no problem with constructive criticism. I just really hate it when people say vague things without any logic or details attached. From my point of view, you're not helping me either realize it's a dead end or how to fix it; you're just saying it sucks<p>On the other hand what you just wrote is a valid constructive criticism which I really truly appreciate... <p>yeah I am aware of it and we're working to fix it... like I said, there's a lot more coming in the near future; whether it's useful or not I'll let other people decide once it's done",1188183202

46863,comment,46855,46855,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Seats?  Tables?  What are those? ;-)<p>I suspect I'd give any ergonomic evaluator a heart attack.  Right now, I'm lying down on the floor, propped up on my elbows.  Other favored positions include cross-legged on the floor, kneeling on my bed with the laptop on my thighs, half-kneeling on the floor with my chin on my knee, prone in bed with about 3 pillows under my chest, in bed on my side wit my elbow propping my upper body up, reclining in a chair with the laptop on my lap and feet up, and sitting in a tree (no, I don't take the laptop up there, but I'll frequently bring pencil & paper to work out some design problem).<p>The one place I absolutely will not work if I have a choice about it is at a table or desk.  Been like that since before I had a computer; in elementary school, I absolutely refused to do my homework at the table, always preferring the floor.<p>You'd think this would result in lots of RSI problems, but I haven't had anything since I was 12, which ironically was when my parents made a concerted effort to get me to sit at a desk and do my homework like a normal person.  I suspect it's because I don't actually do anything repetitive at a computer.  I get up to pace <i>a lot</i> - 5 times in the process of writing this comment, and I've switched to 3 different positions.  That's another reason I really dislike desks - they make getting up a chore, so I don't get up, and so I find my productivity dropping off from lack of exercise.",1188182988
46862,comment,46785,46859,0,0,Zak,,,"I do not have any suggestions for you; I'm not especially good at relationships and don't have much experience with startups. Looking at your screenshot, it looks like your app is essentially a to-do list and messaging tool. Most of us already have those. I don't see how yours will help people balance their work and personal lives any better. Sorry to be negative, but this doesn't look like it does much to address the problem you want to solve.",1188182743
46861,comment,46855,46855,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"I think so. I care enormously much. I spent an inordinate amount of time finding a correct keyboard position and chair configuration. I ended up with a GoldTouch adjustable-angle keyboard I found lying around my workplace, plus two books taped together held up by a waterbottle stolen from a coworker to hold up my wrists. Then, I pilfered a sideways mouse that wasn't being used in another part of the office. <p>Nobody else at the company goes quite so far, but the two other main programmers do have Aeron chairs, at least.

46858,comment,46855,46855,0,0,aston,,,"If they don't, they should. RSI sucks.<p>At Google, they've got ergonomics evaluators on staff. You can schedule one to come by and check out how you're working. They'll fix your chair, remind you how to sit, mouse, and keyboard, and also put in orders for special equipment should you need it. Things like vertical oriented mice, natural keyboards, and boosters for your monitor can make a lot of difference for comfort.",1188181821
46857,comment,46774,46797,0,0,ph0rque,,,"I think that one of the problems that will need to be solved before molecular nanotechnology arrives is how to put together (and take apart) units of atoms using very similar atoms as the dis/assembler. So, if it can be done in Legos using a much smaller number of pieces, it can serve as a model for the molecular dis/assembler.",1188181653

This is from a quick google.<p>I'll talk regarding the Asian market, which is far from saturated (this I'm not going to go compile more research on, so challenge me if you will)<p><a href=""http://www.blogherald.com/2005/05/25/world-wide-blog-count-for-may-now-over-60-million-blogs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blogherald.com/2005/05/25/world-wide-blog-count-f...</a>
Old, but if this is good, 15M blogs in South Korea is quite a large market.<p><a href=""http://blog.mozilla.com/gen/2007/06/27/yahoo-japan-more-page-views-than-yahoo-us/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mozilla.com/gen/2007/06/27/yahoo-japan-more-page...</a>
Recent, but here again I will go uncited: Yahoo dies against Google in USA, but in Asia they have been king. Yahoo is plenty real, and Asia matters to them, a lot.<p>You might be fine with the North American market. It's hella big. But if you have an entry point into Asia and don't use it, that's wasted potential, because cloning works on an international scale.

46853,comment,46845,46845,0,0,aston,,,"You asked for it... <p>I'm gonna keep editing this post with suggestions.<p>- Too many colors. I count like nine or ten. Taking that down to three or four would be awesome and make the site feel less complex. <a href=""http://kuler.adobe.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kuler.adobe.com/</a> to get some pretty ones.<p>- A tag cloud style visualization for ""popular chains"" would be cool and would illustrate the data in a way that's not so tabular and numerical.<p>- New user join times would be cooler as relative to now english statements (like ""5 minutes ago"" instead of 10:01). Same for new chains. And new posts.<p>- I think you should put some thought into what people are going to be thinking when they see the front page. Odds are, a brand new user is going to be totally confused, because there's so much content named with some pretty site-particular jargon. Why not explain the concept there, rather than hiding it two links deep (About->link to a blog post)?<p>- I have to admit, I don't understand what's going on when I click the name of an activity. Like, the chain pictures, what are they linking to? And what are the numbers underneath? Maybe I'm an idiot, but I'm seriously confused.<p>- I see up arrows around the site. I eventually figured out that I could try to click them, but I have no clue why I'd want to (what do they do??) and when I try to click, it asks me to login (for what??). I'm so confused...<p>
- The register process was nice. Threw me right into using the site. I like. Maybe it would be nice, though, to give me the option to choose the interval of time when I'm putting in what I'm doing (rather than forcing daily, then letting me fix it).<p>- So now I know what a chain gang is! But a faq would be nice. <p>- Clicking the +0 next to my post took me to image moderation. That was wholly unexpected.<p>- On the ""What everyone's doing page,"" the link for me to do that activity too looks like a plus-or-minus symbol with the underline. I would vote for a real icon here instead of text, to avoid confusion. And maybe make it more clear what happens if I click it. Text that says ""I'm doing this too!"" (but in fewer words) might speak better to its effect.<p>- Assuming I'm a continual user of the site, my number one priority when I visit is probably the ability to easily confirm that I've done the stuff I wanted to do. So, I think if I'm logged in, my front page that I see when I arrive should give me a way to check off everything I've done. As it stands, I have to click my name to get something like this, which is pretty unintuitive, I think.<p>I'll be back later to add more. I apologize retroactively if any of these suggestions come across offensively. Just my raw thoughts as I use the site.",1188180325

Yes, you can do all manner of nefarious things with native web technologies  as I understand it, this was one of the reasons it took so long for a native JS fullscreen API to be implemented, as it would open the door to spoofing the operating system&#x27;s interface chrome.<p>But where these technologies differ is that Flash was marketed as a one-size-fits-all solution, that allowed designers and developers to work inside of a single framework. The barrier to entry is also very low: you can achieve a lot (relatively speaking) without much technical expertise  certainly when compared to how much effort it might be to do things the right way with native tech.<p>I don&#x27;t ever see this happening with the likes of asm.js or WebGL because they&#x27;re much more narrow in focus, plus they require very different (and non-trivial) skillsets to those of designers. As soon as an endeavour like this requires multiple developers and designers, it no longer appeals to your common or garden chuck it over the wall marketing agency; the only ones that can afford to invest in this are the ones using the tools appropriately (or at least, most of them will be).",1380800886

6488237,comment,6484025,6485507,1,0,dTal,,,">terrorism seems to have accelerated totalitarianism<p>How do you figure? I weakly dispute that totalitarianism is accelerating (there are some worrying trends at various stages of development in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, but <i>accelerating</i> is a strong word - we may just be more aware of power abuses because of the internet), but I strongly dispute that, if true, &quot;terrorism&quot; is the cause. There has always been terrorism. There will always be terrorism. Terrorism is merely the enemy du jour. The idea that terrorism represents a new and uniquely dangerous threat is pure propaganda. Indeed, when you look at some the shit that went down in the latter half of the 20th century, we are living in a comparatively terrorist-free time. Possibly governing politicians are more <i>afraid</i> of terrorism after 9/11 (not because of its lethality as such but because of the unpredictable political aftershocks), but equally (more likely?) they may be consciously aware of its utility at pushing through power grabs. Either way, it&#x27;s not right to call it a <i>cause</i>.<p>Have a look at this:

Also, there&#x27;s a lot of fluff in the 2000s entries. Search for where the word &quot;bomb&quot; appears and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.

He didn&#x27;t refuse to comply at any point - he complied with the original request, at which point the judge gave him fresh instructions and ordered him to comply with those or face a fine.<p>Consider it from another perspective - people often request data from governments or large corporations and, when ordered or pressured into providing it they often do so in the least helpful format available.

Azure... I don&#x27;t know how that works. Heroku would work without github being online, since you&#x27;d push to github - maybe that&#x27;d be an idea?<p>bower_install is annoying, yeah; it should allow for a backup location (s) to resolve dependencies. Maven allows people to configure multiple repositories, which are often mirrored against each other while hosted by vastly different parties; if one repo mirror is offline, there&#x27;s a dozen others available, in a lot of cases.<p>For those components, github is a single point of failure.",1380798269
6488130,comment,6480495,6487032,2,0,csandreasen,,,"The NSA is not a law-enforcement agency.  Unless we find credible evidence otherwise, I&#x27;m going to continue operating under the assumption that there is no click-here-to-send-this-person-to-jail button at the NSA.  To be handed a jail sentence as a result of NSA spying, the process looks more like this:
- NSA analyst stumbles across you, most likely in the course of pursuing a foreign intelligence target, but maybe as part of a vast domestic spying program as some believe (I haven&#x27;t seen enough credible evidence to believe this)<p>- NSA analyst finds credible evidence within that collection to suggest that you were engaged in criminal activity<p>- NSA is able to convince the FBI (or other legitimate law enforcement agency) that you were engaged in criminal activty<p>- The FBI opens an investigation into you; if preliminary investigation yields suspicion, they request a warrant from a judge to gather more information<p>- If the FBI finds sufficient evidence of a crime, they obtain a warrant for your arrest and detain you for trial<p>- Evidence independently obtained by the FBI is presented to a jury of your peers.  As of yet, there&#x27;s no precedent for admitting evidence by the NSA.  To the court it&#x27;s the equivalent of an anonymous tip, and the NSA has a history of not wanting to reveal its sources and methods anyways.<p>- A jury of your peers decides whether or not you are guilty of a crime.  A judge sentences you.<p>So yes, you can get sent to prison based on NSA spying.  It&#x27;s a long process with independent review by multiple parties.  I&#x27;ll be very concerned regarding this process if the first step is broken, which is what everyone is up in arms over.  I don&#x27;t see the evidence yet that this step is broken, or even applicable in most cases [1].<p>Why am I afraid of people getting my addresses, phone numbers, etc.?  My wife testified to put a violent man in prison some years ago.  As a result, I have more concern than most that there are people who would want to do my family harm.  I don&#x27;t like that $15 will tell you where my wife, kids and I sleep at night or give contact information to harass us.  Old information would allow someone to take out a line of credit in my name, leaving me to sort out the financial mess.  Other people I know in legal and law enforcement positions are accutely aware of the threat of being retaliated against outside the courts for perceived wrongs.<p>[1] I have to run to work, and I&#x27;d be insulting your argument if I just left it at that - I&#x27;ll write up an explanation of my views on the Section 215 collect when I get home.  I appreciate the discussion - thank you for actually giving thoughtful answer rather than just a snide remark dismissing me.",1380798265

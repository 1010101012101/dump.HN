It might be a <i>slightly</i> interesting point that the top Google executives don't take out salary, but stories like these are never anything but PR stunts. Anyone with half a chimpanzee's brain understands that these numbers don't mean anything. All 3 of them could take a salary of 500 million dollars, and the shareholders would hardly notice. I suppose the goal with stunts like these is to show solidarity with the workers who earn much less, but this rings hollow when each of them has enough stock to buy the family of every employee. I'm not saying it's a problem that these guys have great fortunes, but it seems a bit cowardly for them to pretend that they are actually quite frugal. They are not, by a long shot.<p>The only thing worth noting is that they only use their own shares for large expenses. But the practical implications of this are miniscule. And in the case of the CEO, these shares were after all issued at a time.",1206485580

There's no way Digg can get the revenue necessary to repay their investors (or even be profitable with their bloated staff), without having to resort to actions like these. Having just a skyscraper ad isn't going to cut it.<p>By essentially allowing their sponsors to decide what's going to be on their front page, they've changed digg from a crowdsourced editorial board to a sponsored RSS feed. 
I can't remember the last time a .com made such a shortsighted decision....I can't see digg even being around in a few years after this.",1283201928

1647535,comment,1645885,1647286,0,0,hga,,,"I think you're misapprehending my point (and I wasn't all that clear or let alone detailed).<p>I agree 100% that deleveraging is what's required, the liquidation of all these bad investments (and for that matter that's what the Austrians recommend).<p>Here I'm talking about <i>timing</i> and secondary effects.  There's a big difference between this effectively happening all at once as banks and other institutions refuse to do business with each other due to the fear of counterparty risk vs. working through this inevitably very painful process over a period of years (traditionally I gather it tends to be about a decade, which is way too slow and painful, but better than the first option).<p>When you allow the first to happen a bunch of viable companies go out of business quickly because they can't do their day to day financial work.  E.g. one of the FDICs actions has been to guarantee <i>non-interest bearing</i> business accounts so that e.g. you can be sure your payroll will happen (even if the bank collapses and a bit of a delay is incurred at worst case).",1283201811

He should surely make sure to only play against other studied players, but the playing of the game is what determines who is best.<p>And who is best is the sum total of the practice and natural ability of the individual players.<p>I keep seeing blog posts taking on the same tack.

Of course it'd be silly to say that it's merely salesmanship.  If I had a crappy vision and I was an epic salesman, I'd be a pretty lousy CEO, right?<p>In all of those tasks, how much of your time are you spending selling?  Discover/find your vision, spend the rest of your career selling it.  Deciding who you want to hire and the persuasive dance (where you have to persuade them that working at your company is a good idea AND sell them your vision to boot!) takes a lot more time.<p>Steve Jobs is a great example.  As product-focused as he is, what % of the time do you think he spends tinkering or wireframing?  I'd wager he's selling/reinforcing ideas for most of his day.  Steve Jobs is different because he spends 99% of his sales time selling vision/product ideas versus all of the other types of persuasion he could engage in.  Oh, and because his ideas are unusually good. ;-)<p>edit: I'd add two things.  Once, I've run 2 different companies for about 70% of my 13 year tech career and two: I  really don't enjoy sales as much as I enjoy other work tasks.

1647475,story,,,2,0,mehta,"Google Synonym search - How it helped me today",,"This post basically describes how i spent my last 10 minutes. The take away from the post below is that you can search for a lot of stuff on Google using ~ when you don't know actual keywords and how the search on all the websites should be.<p>##Story - Start 
I saw an article on HN a few weeks back with a chart that described various stages of a startup. I wanted to see the article again and so I began searching... The only things I knew about the article were that It was about how we should avoid not jump from one idea to another and instead focus on one at a time.<p>- My first query on Google was: ""why i don't take up new ideas"". It definitely did not work as none of the articles on first page were what I was looking for. - I thought that may be I should look for keywords (even though I did not remember any of them). So I start with the word ""Idea"". Yeah, it was a bad idea... - Then I added more keywords: ""idea"" ""optimism"" ""investigation"" ""uninformed"". I knew that the article used these words or their synonyms but I was not sure of the exact words. - I had seen the article in Google Reader so my next try was to search there with different combinations of these. That didn't work either as the search never looked beyond the titles for articles posted on HN.<p>Finally, The solution that worked:I had seen some time ago, the use of ""~"" in Google search. It searches beyond keywords by looking at synonyms etc. And so I used it by searching for ""~idea ~optimism ~investigation ~uninformed""(without the quotes). And that is how I found the article I was looking for.

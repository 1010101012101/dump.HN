I can see that within the context of theory of computer science there may not be a difference between the speed of the two algorithms, since both are ""asymptotically optimal"" (a term I'm not sure I entirely grok), yet within virtually any defined set of random numbers less than infinity the algorithm I provided will perform substantially faster.<p>I suppose I'm at a loss for words, since as a seasoned software developer without a deep background in theoretical computer science, it seems that I am being told to disregard my intuition based on experience in favor of a theoretical model that seems to ignore actual problem sets.

ReST could do the same kind of stuff as HTML: build bullet lists, create tables, italic text, and so forth.  However, since I had already learned HTML, learning another language that did the same thing felt like a waste of time.  I fully believe that Restructured Text is a better markup language than HTML in some ways; however, I simply don't care because the differences are minor, and HTML is so much more powerful.<p>On the other hand, TeX was developed by Donald Knuth, a guy who spent his entire life doing research and writing papers about it.  It has excellent math support, and is a true semantic language.  I've written a few papers in TeX and been very happy with it.<p>Anyway, if RestructuredText were good at typesetting research papers, there would be no need for this project, would there?",1349423621

4616009,comment,4615602,4615948,2,0,lutusp,,,"> Err why is a non lethal, not particularly damaging drug going to be an unethical drug trial?<p>Antidepression drugs, indeed all psychoactive drugs, are always a potential ethics issue. Consider the brouhaha that erupted when it was discovered that some antidepression drugs caused people to commit suicide or have suicidal thoughts:<p><a href=""http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=31649"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=31...</a><p>A quote: ""The FDA has warned that children and adults taking antidepressants can become suicidal in the first weeks of therapy and that physicians should watch patients closely when first giving the drugs or changing dosages. The FDA is asking drug manufacturers to place explicit warnings about the drugs' side effects, including the risk of suicide, on their labels.""<p>Any human-administered drug is a potential ethical issue, from vitamins upward. Imagine a study in which an experimental group is given a daily vitamin, and a control group is given a placebo but told they're receiving a vitamin. Several years go by and the relative health of the study participants is closely monitored.<p>Can you not see the ethical issue here? Can you not imagine the lawsuits that would result from the parents of those in the control group who perhaps didn't thrive as expected, or for some completely imaginary consequence having nothing to do with the vitamin study, but sufficient to sue for civil damages?<p>And finally, depression drugs are hardly ""non lethal, not particularly damaging"". They are a source of great controversy and have been the focus of a number of conflicts over the years.",1349423113

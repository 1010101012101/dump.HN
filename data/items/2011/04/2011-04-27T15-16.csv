The patent misuse theory works insofar as it goes, assuming it can be proved, but the evidence presented is sketchy and only time will tell on that one. This case, though, does illustrate that Android remains the waif child of the mobile device industry, the one who gets periodic beatings, whether from Apple, Oracle, Microsoft, or any other entrenched proprietary player, with software patents often serving as the whip. Meanwhile, Google is frantically scrambling to buy up its own patent portfolios and is filing its own patents like mad to position for the future.

Lucene is a low-level library for implementing a search experience. If you don't understand that then I don't think you understand how a sophisticated search engine like Google works.<p>Say you type in:<p>""Lucene equivalent in C++ or C#""<p>This query is not passed as-is to some magic implementation of a Search Engine by Google.<p>First they need to parse this query. This involves a tokenizer step which will have many rules depending on the context and the language requirements, etc. An industrial strength tokenizer is a significant undertaking in itself.<p>The next step is turn this user query into something that a search engine understands. Unless your default mode of operation is ""match this user query EXACTLY"" then that means having some kind of query language. For any search engine, this will end up looking like the syntax you have a problem with in your post.<p>Next, to have any kind of useful and competitive search experience you will need to take the user query and generates tens, maybe even hundreds or thousands, of different sub-queries that try to explore different estimates of user intent and fuzzy-matching. For example, you might do some analysis and realise that equivalent in this context is not very important and decide to generate another twenty queries with all-known synonyms for the word equivalent. You might decide to try the query with certain words dropped altogether.<p>And of course, you also need to be able to rank results. Not just within sub-queries but when merging all the results from sub-queries together. This takes sophisticated and highly customised scoring algorithms that will be dependent on context and a whole lot of other things. Essentially you need to guess what is the best match based on what you think the user wants.<p>Finally, to be an industry leader like Google you will use a data-driven approach to scoring that makes use of machine-learning techniques to keep your advantage more than a purely technology one.<p>For companies that just want a basic search that will behave intuitively for people used to the Google model, Lucene helps with A LOT of this. Their default query parser, scorer and other vital components are good enough that most websites can just use the default configurations out of the box and get a good search experience.<p>All that you're left with in the end is to create the basic user interface abstraction - the ""one box"" experience. Solr helps enormously with this, but in the end all the functionality it exposes is Lucene.<p>For more complicated search experiences, there isn't much that I described in the above approach that you can't do in Lucene.<p>So yeah, Lucene is awesome.",1303918564

(http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2304691)<p>We received some great responses and excellent advice. The thing that people found the most interesting was the 'effortless cloud supercomputing' aspect, while being least engaged by the spreadsheet-UI.<p>So we trimmed the application to provide something more focused. The result is PythonAnywhere - a interactive Python console in the browser, that runs your code on our servers.<p>http://pythonanywhere.com<p>The user's code runs in a sandbox, to guard against griefers.<p>We're not tied to Python - in a later version, the server-side process could be anything, from Ruby to a Bash shell.<p>Casual use is free, like Dropbox, and we would charge for more resource-intensive services, maybe access to networking, or for access to substantial CPU time or disk space.<p>Prospective users have requested:<p>- Persistent sessions, so you can close your session but then pick it up from another device later on, with screen content, command-line history, and Python context intact.<p>- Server-side storage / Integration with Dropbox or Github or other DVCS hosts.<p>- Shared console sessions, so two or more users can work in the same session, maybe for tutoring, or possibly for remote pairing.<p>- Providing many different Python versions, all loaded with packages from PyPI, so users could try things out without any local install or config.<p>- Providing a grid computing API, to run users' code across several of our EC2 instances.<p>- An editor.<p>We've just gone live today with a limited private beta, in which multiple users can share persistent sessions.<p>We'd appreciate any feedback at all, but we're particularly interested in:<p>- Features that would make it useful to you.<p>- Features that you would pay for.<p>- How well we're presenting our case.<p>Any thoughts would be much appreciated -- thanks in advance!",1303917844

Many real-world applications indirectly suffer from propagation delay, and many of the largest sites have tricks for minimizing delay, and some large companies even want older protocols abandoned due to their inefficient communication.<p>The reason LANs generally haven't cared about propagation delay is that they are not using networks already operating near the <i>ultimate bottleneck</i>: the speed of light.  Some college campuses I know of have less bandwidth than an iPhone.  But for Internet-scale computing, propagation delay is evident.",1303917793

That one example is Prop 13 which limited the amount of taxes that could be put on property and required a two-thirds majority to pass any tax increases.<p>Now let me ask this: If Prop 13 is such a hindrance why is California in the top 5 highest taxing states across the board?<p>Beyond that most of the initiatives are either social issues (Gay Marriage) or done by Percentage (Prop 98 that requires 40% of general fund spending be spent on Education).<p>So California's problems are not because of direct democracy.  The reason the Economist is writing about this now is because they are (by their own admission) a left-leaning publication and Democrats in California believe the solution to California's problems is a tax hike.  But they can't get it done without a couple Republicans because of the 2/3rd rule (imposed by Prop 13, again the only named example in the article).  So the problem from their immediate perspective is ""Direct Democracy"".<p>But mark my words, some day down the line Republicans will get power in California and they will want to cut money to public schools.  When that happens I'd bet all the money in my Bank Account the Democrats are going to be holding Direct Democracy up as their savior.",1303917475

And the industrial grade heavy duty plasma cutter. The shops are really cool and they serve a slightly different purpose than for example TechShop. At TechShop a lot of the tinkering is more social, the Google shops are definitely less crowded. We run a similar much smaller shop at Tinkercad and I hope to expand that one in the future as well. The only gripe I have is that the campus is large enough that the Pi shops are a short distance away so you might not drop down there as often as you would like. That said the EE shop was pretty close to core campus.<p>As for the certification and elitism. The cert process was very straightforward and relevant. People easily forget that metalworking and some woodworking machines don't let you learn by experimenting. These machines kill in seconds, sometimes for mistakes that are very unintuitive. Like wearing gloves has killed several people. Which is unintuitive when you are handling razor sharp pieces of metal. Or the recent fatal accident at Yale where student was pulled in by her hair.<p>As for the particulars of Ihab. He is a very smart and diligent guy but he had very little practical machine shop experience. He recognized it himself and took classes to compensate.

Someone who is not just looking at it as a job but rather believes in the idea and wants to be a part of it. Having said that, I am definitely willing to pay whoever it is I choose to do this for me. All the better if they want to become a bigger part of the project than just a designer/coder but they will be paid whether that is the case or not.<p>It is related to the video game industry, some websites worth looking at are http://www.ign.com and http://www.gamespot.com. The website will borrow some of their features and you might be able to get a decent idea of what the site will look like from looking at those. If you look closely at either site you will see those sites require a large staff to create new content and maintain. I am not trying to clone their features or compete directly with them but rather I will be much more focused on a specific part of what they offer. I am planning on offering one key feature that those sites do not and think it will make the site go viral and grow rapidly.<p><i>Note: I realize some people can transcend the need for relevant experience by just being great at what they do and so it is not necessary that you have a experience with video games.</i><p>I am determined to find the right person to do this with/for me. The ideal candidate will be a very passionate about video games and have a lot of experience with them in one form or another - even if it's just playing them or creating simple content like videos or writing article/reviews. Here is one web developer that really impressed me with his site and portfolio http://mattbrett.com, he hasn't gotten back to me yet.<p>About me:
I went to school for Computer System Technology at BCIT in Vancouver. After that I worked at EA as a QA lead on a year long project(Need for Speed). I left to pursue a career in progaming and was the #1 Starcraft 2 Zerg player in North America for a good portion of the Starcraft 2 beta. Before I Starcraft 2 I played WC3 competitively and recorded commented replays and had the biggest youtube channel for commentated WC3 games. (It's been taken down by youtube now but if anyone wants proof of this I'm sure I could find some old threads that I made about it and PM them from the authoring account on several websites.) After being exactly where I was hoping to be to play SC2 professionally I realized I didn't want to spend the next 5 years sitting in front of a computer screen playing the same game 10-12 hours per day so I decided to join my sister in South America to teach English. I taught in a university there for a year, boated down the Amazon River to Peru, stayed there for 3 months and am now teaching in China. My passion for video games has followed me through three continents and now I feel I have a great idea for a website so I'm going to be dedicating myself to this as much as I was to SC2 when I did things like play 100 games in 24 hours :P - http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=113391<p>If I find the absolute right person for this and they believe in the idea as much as I do I am planning at some point to move to wherever they live so that we can work on it together on an ongoing basis.<p>Thanks for reading =)",1303916825

2489711,comment,2489237,2489237,5,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"<i>The iPhone is not logging your location. Rather, its maintaining a database of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell towers around your current location, some of which may be located more than one hundred miles away from your iPhone, to help your iPhone rapidly and accurately calculate its location when requested</i><p><i>Can Apple locate me based on my geo-tagged Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower data? 
No. This data is sent to Apple in an anonymous and encrypted form. Apple cannot identify the source of this data.</i><p>I think a lot of folks who spent money on Apple products are going to be happy with this, and for that I'm glad.<p>But I didn't find this release adequate. Apple is not tracking me -- they are keeping a time-stamped list of nearby access points on my device, which effectively is a huge breadcrumb trail of everywhere I've been and when. Apple doesn't know it's me -- because the data is encrypted, which makes no sense at all. Whether data is encrypted or not is meaningless. Can I go to the Apple server logs and track incoming downloads and associate them with the data or not? I strongly suspect the answer is ""yes"". If not, that's great, but that wasn't described here.<p>The killer omission? That Apple has been doing all of this -- which is at the very least controversial -- without informing the users in a manner in which they clearly understood it. The response we see is simply a reaction. The ""bug"" here is getting caught.<p>I don't necessarily see anything nefarious at work, but I'm troubled with the idea that Apple was keeping a list of my whereabouts (the nearest access point, for those of you who are literally-minded) without my knowing it. That's a pretty serious breach of user trust, no matter how many times it was covered in the 47-page lawyered-up doc that nobody reads.<p>But like I said, folks are willing to cut Apple lots of slack, and they deserve it. But hell if I'd want to see something like this happen again, from any manufacturer. I'm not so sure that vendors are getting the point.",1303916704

Now,  offering it despite any demonstrated need is an interesting experiment, but it also suggests that the typical paths for learning and support are lacking.<p><i>I think your reply did not contribute much of use to the conversation, and I think that's why you got downvoted </i><p>I asked a question with an unflattering (albeit realistic) supposition.",1303916681

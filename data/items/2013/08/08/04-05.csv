6177398,comment,6173920,6175166,1,0,araes,,,"There was actually a timely article a little while ago on Wired (<a href=""http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/08/qq_netflix-algorithm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/08/qq_netflix-algorithm/</a>) that talked about the Netflix recommendation engine and how it has had to evolve since the days of the Netflix Prize.  Interestingly (to me) was that they have actually had to move away from ratings comparisons with the shift to a primarily &quot;on demand&quot; style of viewership.  As there is so little personal investment in a choice when viewing streamed content (you can just switch 5 seconds in) people are far less likely to reliably rate material.  Instead, they&#x27;ve had to develop algorithms which rely primarily on recent viewing habits (clicks, content seen to completion, left early, time of the day) for their recommendations.  Which then sounds very similar to the goal of recommending viewership topics based on prior reading, rating, and participation in threads.  However, as was noted above, there&#x27;s the issue of &quot;genetic diversity&quot; to your viewing pool, so you&#x27;d probably want to do something like Pandora and cross-breed your interests with those of similar, but non-identical viewers to suggest topics that might interest you.  Giving a profile of how they are balancing you that you could also edit would help further.",1375937858

This is because some startups, no matter how unlikely, will succeed, and some VC will, despite our better judgment, have invested in them.

There&#x27;s just nothing general about it.  Our principles are ours, not the universe&#x27;s.<p>You&#x27;ve actually picked out a great example: that one generated some absolutely immense conflict.<p>Maybe most of us share an opinion that we feel so strongly about that we&#x27;re willing to accept and to engage in that level of conflict in order to ensure that our position dominates.  When matters of life and death, freedom and slavery are made into political questions, then the possibility that the political process will succumb to violent conflict certainly increases.  Perhaps you feel that the cost is worth it to eliminate slavery or to destroy tyranny, and I&#x27;d agree with you.  But how many questions is it really worth it for?  Can you name a single modern political issue that you&#x27;d think was worth a civil war?<p>I&#x27;m merely pointing out that <i>principles aren&#x27;t general</i>: they belong to people in particular, and when people with conflicting principles attempt to universalize their values in the same space, the result is escalating conflict. For the vast majority of modern political controversies, I prefer the &quot;agree to disagree&quot; approach, finding viable ways for people with incompatible values to live by their own values within their own space, enabling them to peacefully coexist with each other, and to enjoy the benefits of interacting with each other to the extent where and when their values don&#x27;t conflict.<p>NB: the example of slavery is actually even more interesting here, because in a famous ruling in 1772 (in a dispute known as Somersett&#x27;s Case), slavery was determined to have always been illegal under the common law.

6177335,comment,6176222,6176774,1,0,tzs,,,"> The major criticism of the system is that students can just incur this debt then flee the country.<p>That would be the big roadblock to implementing something like that in the US.<p>In the US, when evaluating whether or not to do (or continue) some program that provides aid or assistance, there are a lot of people who focus primarily on whether or not it is possible to cheat the system. It doesn&#x27;t matter to them if 99 out of 100 people getting the aid are following the rules and having their lives greatly improved (and indirectly improving things for the country as a whole). It is that 1 out of 100 who gets aid who did not qualify that is all they see.<p>> If they earn no taxable income here, they never have to pay it back no matter how much they earn overseas. I can&#x27;t really think of an easy way to resolve this because it&#x27;s impossible to garnish income from another country.<p>This should be solvable. Change the law so that payment is owed on foreign income, even if that income is not taxable in Australia, and make it so that the Australian government can bring a civil suit for a monetary judgement against those who do not pay.<p>I believe (but someone should check me on this) that at least in the US, Australia could enforce that judgement. The US would recognize the Australian court&#x27;s jurisdiction (assuming the defendant is still an Australian citizen), and would recognize Australia&#x27;s right to tax foreign income. That, combined with whatever treaties I am almost certain the US and Australia have, should be enough for the US to consider the judgement enforceable, and to enforce it for Australia.<p>My recollection is that due to various treaties between most pairs of first world countries, escaping debt in one by going to another is fairly difficult, unless the debt in the first involved something that is morally frowned upon in the second. E.g., if you owed a pimp for prostitution services in some country where prostitution is legal, countries where prostitution is not legal might not recognize this even if they otherwise recognize debts from the first country.",1375935894

You are quite right that the computer systems and standard rules screwed you over.<p>That is why Financial Aid Advisers (the ones at your school) can make judgement calls on a case by case basis to override the computer system.<p>Specifically, there are two qualities of your described situation which qualify you for such an override.\n1. You mentioned that you are couch surfing with friends. This means you are homeless\n2. You made a good amount on previous employment and your story seems to suggest that said employment is no longer active. This means you have recently lost your job.\nAccording to FAFSA guides for financial aid advisers, professional judgement may be used to adjust parameters which are used to calculate your expected family contribution.<p>Your situation appears to apply to several typical cases in which professional judgement is recommended.<p>1. &quot;A student is considered homeless if he or she lacks fixed, regular, and adequate housing. This includes students who are living in shelters, motels, cars, or parks, or who are temporarily living with other people because they have nowhere else to go.&quot; -<a href=""https://fafsa.ed.gov/fotw1314/help/fahelp29a.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fafsa.ed.gov/fotw1314/help/fahelp29a.htm</a><p>2. &quot;Special circumstances may include tuition \nexpenses at an elementary or secondary \nschool, medical, dental, or nursing home \nexpenses not covered by insurance, unusually high child care or dependent care costs, \nrecent unemployment of a family member \nor an independent student, a student or \nfamily member who is a dislocated worker \n(as defined in section 101 of the Workforce \nInvestment Act of 1998), the number of \nparents enrolled at least half time in a degree, certificate, or other program leading \nto a recognized educational credential at \nan institution with a program participation \nagreement under section 487, a change in \nhousing status that results in an individual \nbeing homeless (as defined in section 103 \nof the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance \nAct), or other changes in a familys income, \na familys assets or a students status. Special circumstances shall be conditions that \ndifferentiate an individual student from a \nclass of students rather than conditions that \nexist across a class of students.

I do not know what made them turn you away before but it may be as simple as not knowing. I had a similar situation in school myself, it turned out that the first adviser I worked with was somewhat new to their job and just did not know they could make a judgement call.<p>Never give up.

I would be completely surprised if it is common (by that I mean at least more than IE6 usage) at all. However, you&#x27;ve presented no evidence of this fact only anecdote. Seriously there is absolutely no evidence that there is a growing popularity of no-js people out there. Perhaps for very specific demographics, in which case I certainly hope whoever is building product for them knows their customer well enough to know that or God help them.<p>Either way they are not going to be building the latest in interactive experiences or web-based gaming for your cousin with her rubbish computer are they. That doesn&#x27;t discount the fact that many people are building exactly that these days.<p>I&#x27;m tired of people on Hacker News making blanket arguments like &quot;never do this&quot; especially something as bland as requiring javascript. They have absolutely no clue what they are talking about.<p>Bottom line is if I (and Google and 37 signals and countless others) can choose to build something that doesn&#x27;t support even IE8 I can quite happily choose to require Javascript to use my web <i>application</i>.

To quote his recent book:<p>> [T]oday, I passed several strangers on the street without any of them attacking me. I bought food from a grocery store, not at all concerned that it might be unfit for human consumption. I locked my front door, but didn&#x27;t spare a moment&#x27;s worry at how easy it would be for someone to smash my window in. Even people driving cars, large murderous instruments that could crush me like a bug, didn&#x27;t scare me.<p>>Most amazingly, this worked without much overt security. I don&#x27;t carry a gun for self-defense, nor do I wear body armor. I don&#x27;t use a home burglar alarm. I don&#x27;t test my food for poison. I don&#x27;t even engage in conspicuous displays of physical prowess to intimidate other people I encounter.<p>>It&#x27;s what we call trust. Actually, it&#x27;s what we call civilization.<p>His point is that we <i>need</i> trust.  You <i>can&#x27;t</i> actually watch for every possible betrayal.  Trust in fear of retribution will suffice, but there needs to be some trust, or there can be no complex civilization.",1375934584

You might say &quot;LSD Madness&quot; was a major meme back then, and heroin was the big evil hard drug that caused the most fear.<p>This is largely from direct observation back then, e.g. in 3rd grade a bit before &quot;War on Drugs&quot; was coined I had to write a <i>thorough</i> workbook detailing all the major drugs being abused then, why they were bad for you, etc.<p>And, errr, here you posit &quot;total - non-trivial number < most&quot; (if I&#x27;m not too tired to express that); on its face it&#x27;s just an impression you have.

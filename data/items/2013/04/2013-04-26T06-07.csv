The fact remains that if you think you're pretty, but you're actually ugly, all of the effects that come from being perceived as ugly will still come into play, which the article goes into to great detail about.<p>Yes, feeling confident about yourself is helpful, but as the article said, ""the increased confidence of attractive workers only explained 15% to 20% of the beauty premium.""<p>The fact that women basically have to spend hours dealing with makeup only reinforces the OP's post. I don't see how that's a response to what he said.<p>If you look at the picture, the overall facial structure plays a great role in the transformation. Thinning of the face is not just about losing weight/fat. There is bone structure at play and there are other bodily tissues at play that you can't just remove with exercise.<p>Look. Your response seriously comes off as one of those banal ""If you think you're ugly you are ugly. It's all about self-confidence.

That said - if true, I hope this teacher is fired and never teaches again without strong supervision.<p>I think the virality of the original image makes the snopes dissection pertinent, if only because it highlights the way the ability for things to go viral on the internet has changed the way in which people are now being held accountable for egregious abuses of positions of power and leadership, where they may have been able to stay under the radar in the past.

I've heard (a lot) about the Arduino, so I may not be the best example, but my programming side projects are more likely to use Processing, Cinder, VPT, or some other thing that doesn't necessarily need to interface with that kind of hardware.<p>If we're talking about the original article, side projects were mentioned in the context of ""The instinct to experiment first"". There might be some correlation there, but if you limit the focus to programming side projects you've just chosen a slightly bigger box to experiment in.<p>Many advances in science come by drawing knowledge from a completely different field and applying it to a familiar one. Deep knowledge of programming is necessary but not sufficient for creative programming solutions.

Plus you forgot the time to buy groceries, wash dishes, eat (drinking something like soylent is 5x faster than chewing food), etc. The average adult probably spends 45min-1h per day doing something necessary for preparing food. The guy has a point: Soylent does save time:<p><i>""I used to spend about 2 hours per day on food. Typically I would cook eggs for breakfast, eat out for lunch, and cook a quesadilla, pasta, or a burger for dinner. For every meal at home I would then have to clean and dry the dishes. This does not include trips to the grocery store. Now I spend about 5 minutes in the evening preparing for the next day, and every meal takes a few seconds. I love order of magnitude improvements, and I certainly don't miss doing dishes. In fact I could get rid of the kitchen entirely, no fridge sucking down power, no constant cleaning or worrying about pests, and more living space.

I do not share this view. I like that Maven is opinionated about things like project structure.</i><p>Well his opinion is perfectly true - Maven does assume there is one right way to build for everyone. You're disagreeing about whether it's a <i>bad</i> thing.<p>And here's the deal - for the 95% (or more) of projects where ""The Maven Way"" works, it's a good thing, for all the reasons you've stated.<p>But not every project fits into that, and one of Maven's limitations is that once you start to push at its boundaries, it falls apart. It doesn't provide enough flexibility to be able to stretch it into places it wasn't intended to go. And so, once your project his that point you either need to fight the tool, or throw it out and use something else. Neither is particularly desirable.<p><i>Maven is one of many tools that isn't cool but is certainly good enough.</i><p>For most cases, yes, but not always. No matter who you are, your experience is not universal enough to draw those conclusions for other people's projects.<p><i>How much time do you spend editing build files anyway?</i><p>Personally? Enough to have run into all sorts of limitations in Maven.<p>Not everyone is working on ""Maven WAR project"". There are projects with full time build engineers. Even on small projects (in terms of lines of code) if the artifacts you're producing are non-standard, then you can spend days (or even weeks) wrestling with maven to get the project under control.<p>Maven makes the easy things trivial, the average things easy, but it also makes the hard things nearly impossible.

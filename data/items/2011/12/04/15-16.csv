For example, they are unbeatable when it comes to arriving on time. Incomparably better than any other european carrier.<p>And of course, they have routes that are not operated by anybody else that won't ask you like 4 times more money for the flight.<p>At the moment they don't operate the route I use the most. I find myself using a regular carrier. After picking the dates carefully I'm still spending roughly three times more than I used to.\nsure the service is a bit fancier but still, it's a huge difference.",1323014387

3310897,comment,3310081,3310081,22,0,IgorPartola,,,"There seem to be lots of people here that are offended by the ""Node.js cancer"" line. I am not defending his choice of words, but in TFA he wrote ""Unix can do that all by itself with out all the stupid Node.js cancer."". I take it as, ""there is no reason to have node.js involved since simpler tools can accomplish the same task"". This says nothing about Node.js itself. In fact, try re-reading that same sentence but substituting a different technology from the following list: [MySQL, MS SQL, PHP, Perl, Visual Basic]. Does it sound slightly more reasonable now?<p>From what I gather his gripe was with the fact that the original Hubot was over-engineered. I agree that it was. Not only that, but the original Hubot came with almost no useful documentation, and a pretty horrible bootstraping mechanism (scripts that download other scripts onto a server over HTTP should never be run in prod environments). Getting it to run one step away from how it was intended (specifically on IRC) required digging deep into the code since the command line options/environment variables that were supposed to be passed in to make it tick were not exposed in any docs. This <i>daemon process</i> did not background itself properly, writing a PID file, etc. The whole thing was a cool proof of concept, but running it in production would make me very nervous. On top of that, it did require Redis, for some ungodly reason. SQLite would have been a much nicer choice since it's much more easily obtained (at least on CentOS) and does not require a separate process or having to configure. (Offtopic: has anyone had good experiences with SQLite style no-sql data stores? Something like MongoDB, but storing stuff on disk and accessing it in-process?).<p>Don't get me wrong. Hubot is awesome. It's just that it's only awesome at GitHub, where it integrates into all sorts of ecosystem <i>and</i> the culture. I tried it for an afternoon, and by default it comes with no useful plugins (mustache generators notwithstanding) because the plugins are the trivial part when you have a great infrastructure already. Imagine if I handed you the source to bash, but you and everyone you know uses MS DOS. Yes, you can see that bash has potential to be powerful, but until you have utilities like find, ls, grep, awk, sed, ed, cat, and so on.",1323014316

3310893,comment,3310063,3310063,26,0,oz,,,"I'm a former fundamentalist Christian who wrestled long and hard over this exact issue a few years ago. Allow me to elaborate:<p>There is a sizeable group of Christians who practice what is known as 'spiritual warfare.' Basically, this worldview sees the work of Satan in <i>everything</i>. Marital problems? ""Satan, I bind you in the name of Jesus Christ."" Financial woes? ""Satan, I bind you in the name of Jesus Christ."" Problems at work? ""Satan, I bind you in the name of Jesus Christ."" 'Binding' the devil apparently dispatches angels who 'subdue' the demons responsible for your problem. Just watch TBN for an hour and you'll see what I'm talking about. For the first few months of my conversion, this is the subculture I was in.<p>I remember one day visiting the FreeBSD website (this is after refusing to use a computer for 1 month because the Internet was <i>obviously</i> a part of Satan's diabolic ploy to entrap mankind), and closing the tab when I saw Beastie. You see, in that culture, there is a meme that certain objects 'attract' demons. Listening to certain songs invites demonic infestation. Watching horror movies practically guarantees it.<p>I vowed then that I would never use FreeBSD. Even though benchmarks showed superior stability and SMP performance than Linux, I couldn't knowingly invite demons into my life like that! By Beastie...Tux, here I come.<p>Thankfully, I deconverted a few months later. But I understand where she is coming from. If she was one the 'warfare' crowd, she'd probably have spent the entire night in fervent prayer, battling the 'forces of darkness.' My mom, for example, would NOT have stayed in that hotel. Wouldn't happen.<p>Oh man, do I have stories to tell!<p>For tidbits on my experiences on HN:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1062267"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1062267</a>\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=611122"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=611122</a>\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2202900"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2202900</a>",1323014253

3310891,comment,3309108,3310461,1,0,Khroma,,,"Not to the extent of African immigrants, no.<p>First, there's already an established Asian community that has been here for a long town. There are old Chinatowns, Little Tokyos, etc. There's no Little Nairobi that I've ever heard of. So many Asians aren't actually recent immigrants.<p>Second, regarding those who are, many Asians aren't here by merit alone. Sure, there are some (like my parents) who came from a poorer background and managed to make it to the US. But increasingly they are supplemented by people who were born into rich families (fu er dai, ""second generation rich people""). Now, I don't have statistics to back this up, but this seems to be more prevalent now because of China's recent economic boom. It's just my own theory, anyway.<p>Also, if you were to visit some Chinese social event (church for example), there are distinct groups of people. It's not just middle class white collar workers, there are also lower class people and older people. There are multiple generations, from the older people (mostly Cantonese speaking, at least where I live), to the middle aged people, to the young people (either ABCs or international students).",1323014242

3310787,comment,3310355,3310355,10,0,michaelochurch,,,"Ok, before I go and offend a bunch of people, let me explain that I'm describing how things <i>are</i>, not how they should be. A lot of the aspects of the business world that I'm about to describe are morally wrong and deeply disgusting. I'm not defending those.<p>First, technology is <i>a lot</i> less ageist than mainstream business (i.e. BDC-land).<p>Here's the thing about corporate culture. Anyone or anything (a group, a project) that is judged to be not successful (regardless of reason, regardless of whether it's that person's or group's fault) is avoided like a corpse. What ageism is about is the (often unfair) negativity directed at people judged to have underperformed their age curve. In mainstream business, there's an expectation that a person will be in an informal leadership role no later than 32, be in an official leadership role (i.e. manager or executive) by 35, be a VP by 40, (S|E)VP by 45, and CxO by 50.<p>Here's where sciences and technology have an edge. There's absolutely nothing wrong with being a non-managerial programmer, scientist, or mathematician at 40, or even at 60. The best tend to peak later (with a few notable exceptions) so most of them are just starting to do their best work at this age. I repeat, there's nothing wrong in technology with being non-managerial at 40. No one looks down on you for that if you're great at what you do.<p>Contrast: in mainstream business, if you're still at the analyst/associate level doing line work at 40, no one will want to talk to you. Most investment banks have one ""adult analyst"" (i.e. someone in his late 20s or 30s working alongside college kids who use ""steak sauce"" as an accolade) and his co-workers mock the hell out of him behind his back.<p>There is a catch: by 35, you have to be really good, and you should probably have more than one specialty in which you can out-perform 99% of the competition. By that age, it's not enough to just be talented; you need to come with a seriously formidable skill set. The upside of this is that in technology, working hard and working smart means you <i>will</i> be good. The technology career is quite volatile but it's pretty easy to have reliable, steady improvements in one's level of skill. This is a lot better than mainstream business (banking, biglaw) where people can be passed over for no reason at all.",1323011385

You misunderstand _his_ point:<p>He's releasing Lamson under GPL, so the Django folks can't use it.  But if he was releasing Lamson under a proprietary license, they couldn't even look at it.  The GPL leaves them better off.  But while BSD projects generally don't complain about proprietary forks, some of them whine bitterly about the GPL (which, again, leaves them better off).<p>Choosing the BSD license for your code is, in effect, choosing to allow others to rerelease under more restrictive terms.  If you made that choice, I'm not sure it makes a whole lot of sense to complain when people do that.",1323011366

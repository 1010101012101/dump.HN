1814940,comment,1812134,1812777,0,0,MarkMc,,,"For Average Joe there are still significant pain points that a Mac App store can remedy.<p>For example, I produce accounting software - here are the problems my would-be users face:<p>1. Where can users find a list of suitable accounting software products?  Usually they Google 'accounting software', but this gives them plenty of crud such as: a) accountants websites; b) accounting software from other countries. c) advice websites. d) accounting software for big companies<p>2. When users get to a website for an accounting product, it can be difficult to to find out even basic information such as: a) The price; b) Screenshots; c) the Download button; d) the 'Buy Now' button.  The App Store listings make this as plain as the nose on your face.<p>3. How can users compare accounting software products?  At the moment you have to find a website with software reviews and hope the information is up-to-date, impartial and accurate.  The ratings system in the App Store is better than almost any website.<p>4. The user doesn't know how easy or painful it is to install the software until they try. On windows, if they try downloading setup.exe they get TWO warnings saying 'This could harm your computer... are you sure?'.  Maybe they remember last April when they clicked OK to a similar message and ended up with a virus. With the App Store the user knows that it's a one-click install and will not get any scary messages about harming their computer.<p>5. Can the user trust the website to process their credit card details correctly.  Maybe they remember the last time they tried on another website and the site froze after they clicked 'submit' so they didn't know if it had worked.  Or they read about a company that had all their credit card details stolen.  The Mac Store is seen as far more trustworthy by Average Joe because it is run by Apple.<p>6. The software update process for App Store is a breeze - better than most ad-hoc software update solutions.  And the user knows it before they install the accounting software because they have already used it for updating other software.<p>My guess is that the Mac App Store will be huge, and being ranked well will be like striking gold.  Let the gold rush begin!",1287658419

1814917,comment,1814537,1814756,0,0,cletus,,,"High school is where a select few get to be popular just before they spend the rest of their lives pumping gas and waiting tablets for a living.<p>Germany, as one example, actually separates out their high school system is split. From:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Germany"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Germany</a><p>> German secondary education includes four types of school. The Gymnasium is designed to prepare pupils for university education and finishes with the final examination Abitur,<p>> after grade 12 or 13. The Realschule has a broader range of emphasis for intermediate pupils and finishes with the final examination Mittlere Reife, after grade 10; the Hauptschule<p>> prepares pupils for vocational education and finishes with the final examination Hauptschulabschluss, after grade 9 or 10 and the Realschulabschluss after grade 10. There are two types<p>> of grade 10: one is the higher level called type 10b and the lower level is called type 10a; only the higher level type 10b can lead to the Realschule and this finishes with the final<p>> examination Mittlere Reife after grade 10b. This new path of achieving the Realschulabschluss at a vocationally-oriented secondary school was changed by the statutory school<p>> regulations in 1981 - with a one-year qualifying period. During the one-year qualifying period of the change to the new regulations, pupils could continue with class 10 to fulfil the<p>> statutory period of education. After 1982, the new path was compulsory, as explained above. Other than this, there is the Gesamtschule, which combines the approaches. There are also<p>> Förderschulen/Sonderschulen. One in 21 pupils attends a Förderschule.[2][3] Nevertheless the Förderschulen/Sonderschulen can also lead, in special<p>> circumstances, to a Hauptschulabschluss of both type 10a or type 10b, the latter of which is the Realschulabschluss.<p>Perhaps the reason that high school is so disconnected to the rest of life is that everyone goes through the same system. After that, you go to college (or not). Whether or not you go, to what school you go and what you study is largely merit-based.<p>The private education system is better in some ways but isn't merit-based. It's largely a function of the economic circumstances of the students' parents.",1287657463

The group that preferred silence but had music performed, unsurprisingly, comparatively badly.<p>The sting in the tail was this. The task they were given had an ""Aha!"" insight buried in it.

There's obviously plenty of other JVM-based server development going on, and it'll be a pain if that stops working properly.<p>As for Cocoa bindings in higher-level languages on Mac, there are MacRuby, Nu and Mono.

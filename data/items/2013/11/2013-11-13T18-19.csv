6727493,comment,6725891,6727062,6,0,pjmlp,,,"> So legitimate question, is the CLR better than the JVM at cross language support and if so what makes it better?<p>Yes in the early days, because JVM was initially designed just for Java and many bytecodes are directly related to Java semantics.<p>Meaning any language that targets the JVM has to adapt their semantics to Java semantics at the bytecode level, hence the tricks mapping closures to anonymous classes as one example from many.<p>This got better with the introduction of new bytecodes in Java 7 and the upcoming Java 8, but it is still a Java VM at heart.<p>The CLR was designed as language agnostic, meaning its design had to support a good implementation of VB, C# and C++ on day one, alongside other languages from Microsoft partners like Eiffel and COBOL as two possible examples.<p>There is inclusive a .NET ABI for interoperability between languages, CLS (Common Language Specification).<p>So the bytecode is much more generic and more low level than the JVM bytecode is.<p>Then thanks to the work done on IronPython and IronRuby, it got the DLR part with allows for better performance of dynamic languages implementations. Since initially CLR was mostly targeted for strong typed languages.<p>Nowadays both platforms are quite similar in terms of language support.",1384369169

I haven&#x27;t used it on my own kids yet because they&#x27;re still too young, but I did buy the set and I think it looks good. If you read &quot;Good Questions for Math Teaching&quot; you will probably modify the way the problems are presented to make them more open-ended, but I like that topics are introduced with a problem that is later explained, instead of explaining then drilling.<p><a href=""http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Store/curriculum.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Store/curriculum.php</a><p>Finally, I thought that this online course was a nice introduction to the approach.

I&#x27;m working with the people who are building these cloud systems, so let me elaborate a little:<p>No, the Wolfram Language is not natural language. It&#x27;s the LISP-like language <i>behind</i> Mathematica. We needed to do that from a branding perspective so that the Mathematica product can continue to exist for the academic market without being conflated with the underlying language, which has much wider aspirations.<p>But as for natural language, you <i>can</i> press &#x27;=&#x27; and go into &#x27;natural language mode&#x27; and write stuff like &quot;total the list&quot;, but in my opinion it isn&#x27;t very good yet and is only really useful for absolute beginners. I think it could get much better in the future when we have nice sophisticated type inference going (which I am working on <i>right now</i>).<p>As for IPython: the In[..] and Out[..] lines you see in IPython (and amusingly some other cloud system-based IDEs now) mirror v1 of Mathematica back in 1987 (I believe deliberately). It&#x27;s an amusing accident of syntax that evaluating In[1] works in both Python <i>and</i> Mathematica.<p>But yes, exactly, part of this whole story is an online IDE (actually, a set of them) that makes it extremely easy to get a whole system deployed. Imagine setting up some machine learning, creating some slick visualizations, allocating some persistent storage, putting it behind an API, and creating an embedded dashboard, all in the space of 20 minutes and a few dozens of lines of code.<p>The closest existing competitor is FP complete&#x27;s cloud Haskell system, but I&#x27;d love to know about others.",1384368752

...
         indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including attorneys fees, related to the distribution or use of your programs.
*<p>So, if you redistribute these libraries, you agree to be on the hook for MS legal bills.<p>*
Distribution Restrictions. You may not
         modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution, that<p>         the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or<p>         others have the right to modify it.
*<p>So it is anti-GPL.  I personally think this is a good thing, I hate the copy-virus in the GPL.  Maybe this is even a poison pill that invalidates GPL code in a project, thereby protecting you from inadvertently letting your code fall under GPL (which I would consider to be a good thing).  Whichever clause wins, this is a quagmire.<p>Lets continue.<p>*
you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not<p>         work around any technical limitations in the software;<p>         reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation;<p>         publish the software for others to copy;<p>         rent, lease or lend the software;<p>         transfer the software or this agreement to any third party; or<p>         use the software for commercial software hosting services.

BACKUP COPY. You may make one backup copy of the software. You may use it only to reinstall the software.

So there is an underlying dependence on digital contact information.<p>The other problem with group chat today is that over time group chats can veer off topic. Group chats can become static never-ending threads, like one long email chain, instead of being topical and then just going away.<p>What if you could group chat without the exchange of contact information and without the dependence on a central admin? What if the barrier to creating group chats is reduced so that they can be created instantly? How do you get 20 people in a physical room to start chatting instantly, and, by extension, friends who later might want to join the chat?<p>This is why we built ChatTag (available on the App Store or check us out at chattag.com).

Which investor do you want an intro to, and why? I know my investors well. Some of them love meeting early-stage startups. With others, you are wasting your time unless you&#x27;ve already raised significant capital. Other times I can&#x27;t help at all (recently got asked for an intro by a B2C company--I know my investors from a B2B perspective since that&#x27;s where my company is, and I&#x27;m not sure who would be a best fit for a B2C company.)<p>2) Be real. If you don&#x27;t have any customers/pipeline, traction, or even a working demo, you&#x27;re not ready for investment. For some reason there tends to be a pervasive belief that a &quot;napkin idea&quot; can get funded. Maybe 1% of the time, that&#x27;s true. But even with a previous exit under my belt, I still had to have some form of traction before I got investors onboard. If you have nothing except an idea, please feel free to ask for advice, but don&#x27;t ask for advice on looking for investors, because I&#x27;m going to tell you to focus on traction first.",1384368277

One big advantage is that it prevents feature creep.<p>I wrote a library a while back called DelayedOp for wrangling async calls in JS. Originally it was 5 lines of CoffeeScript, and I actually used it in that form for a while. It&#x27;s much bigger now and full of features to aid in debugging.

I see in another comment thread you agreed with the sentiment, &quot;From my experience with PostgreSQL and MySQL, it is a bit like the difference between python and php, one is a great work of craftmanship that is reliable, predictible, coherent, enjoyable to work with and minimise the wtf/mn rate (which is the best quality measure in software), while the other is a bunch of hacks knit together to make it work asap and its wtf/mn is skyscraping.&quot;<p>Makes sense. I guess I&#x27;ve always assumed that while MySQL has gotchas, so too would database X. They come with the territory of databases, being such a large part of any app, yet separate from it and usually infinitely more complex than the apps that use them. To that end, I think it&#x27;s why some people end up writing their own simpler data stores or caching middleware between databases/OLAP and front-ends. Such written-from-scratch solutions can be easier to debug when things are mission-critical.<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen with databases, the really complicated part is &quot;setting them up correctly&quot;. If you start out with most defaults, something will eventually become a gotcha forcing a schema rewrite or a database transplant using an SQL dump. But that&#x27;s just been my experience: with databases, expect to not get it 100% right the first time (unless it&#x27;s not your first time with the technology, of course). And from that perspective, the technology used is less important, it will equally have &quot;gotchas&quot;.<p>That all said, I too will be playing around more with Postgres to see how it compares to the InnoDB/XtraDB I&#x27;ve a hate/love relationship with. ;)",1384367782

The professors being Math PhDs, don&#x27;t adjust their any of their classes enough for the lack of foundational knowledge. It frustrated me very much.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a big mystery why you probably hit that college wall when most college curriculums are set up that way.",1384366934

Interesting. I seem to recall that the Getting Things Done time-management technique uses this very approach to help weed out unnecessary work (reading). The idea is that if the article is safely bookmarked, there&#x27;s no longer any worry that  we might loose track of something important yet (as you experienced) most of what gets bookmarked can be safely discarded without reading at all, saving time. So in the GTD context this &quot;bug&quot; is a &quot;feature&quot;.",1384366841

For example I have a ConfigReader type class that does exactly and only what you would expect.  I have a typeclass for writing to the database, for call distributed process, etc. Now because some of those require MonadIO I do end up with a lot of code that could theoretically do any IO.

6727083,comment,6725376,6726724,1,0,kandrea,,,"This is another one of those interesting areas to explore in CS education that comes up a lot in conversation.  Of course, there is no one path for everyone and there are many people who would thrive and reach greater levels of proficiency and success outside of this sort of environment.<p>For my bit, I received a 2-year degree in a programming-centric degree program (systems programming) and my 4-year degree in a CS-focused degree program, which placed a much heavier emphasis on theory and models. Coming from my first college, I was upset over having to &#x27;repeat&#x27; a lot of subject areas, only to find out that under a different focus these courses offered a better perspective over areas I was missing understanding in.<p>Looking at the two years I worked as a TA and the time I have spent assisting in an applied programming student organization, I&#x27;ve come across many students who have complained about not being able to skip ahead to the more advanced materials.  Several complain vociferously about having to take the theory and logic courses. Others complain about the course in low-level programming (C -- which is not even low-level) or systems programming. Most of the time that I&#x27;ve seen, this is a result of simply not understanding the concepts as result of a lack of foundational knowledge.  Mathematics is an area continually complained about amongst the newer students as a requirement for &#x27;programming&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with students who wanted to push straight to the senior-level courses while having no real understanding of basic data structures, fundamental algorithms, core programming structure concepts (ie. have never learned/used recursion), or even had any exposure to taking the time to structure their thoughts before diving into the code.<p>I&#x27;ve always been more of the &#x27;renaissance man&#x27; when it comes to education, but I&#x27;ve learned to appreciate and I do support the balancing that universities engage in, in order to provide a core CS framework for their degree programs.  University degrees should not be able gaining the information needed to go out and program, but should be focused more on these topics involving theory and the mathematical underpinnings of the field.  This should involve some levels of useless, pedantic academia.<p>While we do not offer the ability to challenge courses in this department, one area I do highly push students to get involved in is laboratory research with professors.  We had two undergrads with no prior systems education build and write the drivers for custom robots recently, after they came in looking to get involved in such a project.  Many professors, in my limited experience, are eager to see students who are looking for additional challenges in their studies and are only too happy to provide additional experience in desired areas for them.",1384366338

Even the function sheets provided during some math exams are needlessly obtuse, for the sake of proving whether or not somebody can remember exactly what the different constants or inputs into the functions are.

6727032,comment,6726357,6726357,6,0,arielweisberg,,,"100k+ concurrent threads is a realistic starting point for M:N threading. As long as native threads require a separate preallocated stack that never shrinks there will always be a mismatch compared to the capabilities you get running thread per core event based code.<p>Making M:N threads a first class POSIX feature is a good starting point as long as it also allows you to express the intended locality of groups of threads. Locality isn&#x27;t optional anymore. The slowdowns he reports also map to scale up issues you see when you don&#x27;t think about keeping frequently accessed mutable data local and shared nothing to an OS thread.<p>M:N threads are just an abstraction around a stack and registers that frees you from having to bind up a bunch of related state into a series of objects and maps. It&#x27;s awesome, I want it, but nothing is quite there yet. At least not if you want something like Java or C/C++ performance.<p>Work stealing across cores is really nice, but I am not sure it is always the behavior you want. A programmer can tell when migrating a task across cores is going to hurt more than waiting a little longer to get to it.<p>I also think any discussion of M:N threads or multi-threading is also incomplete if it doesn&#x27;t also include garbage collection as a means of passing data between threads. Right now we have languages that are garbage collected and treat native memory as a second class citizen and non-GC languages that make multi-threading a headache.<p>GC is great for multi-threading, but not so great for hundreds of gigabytes of variable lifetime objects. Even if the GC can handle it, GC still has unacceptable 2x space overhead.<p>I don&#x27;t want much :-)<p>The youtube video doesn&#x27;t load for me :-(",1384365829

6727029,comment,6725096,6725096,1,0,anonymoushn,,,"I&#x27;d like to propose a third policy, the NOPtransferpayment. The way the new policy will work is, a new tax will be implemented for 1000 times the net income of every person who earns an income (after all other taxes and transfer payments). A new transfer payment will be implemented for 1000 times the net income of every person who earns an income (after all other taxes and transfer payments). This tax and transfer payment will not count toward calculations used by other programs. A new department will be created and staffed by 0 people, and 0 new forms will be necessary to implement the tax and transfer payment.<p>A policy like this could reasonably be said to cost nothing, produce nothing, and indeed do nothing. If we think that congress generally makes the world a worse place by implementing policies that do things, then it would be an improvement for congress to work on this sort of thing instead. However, its cost-benefit under the proposed model is not $0 or (pay_per_lawmaker * n_lawmakers * nop_debate_time) but $13 quadrillion. The proposed model indicates that this program costs about 180 years of global production at the current rate, or a substantial portion of the value of the entire planet and all humans living on it. If we suppose the planet is worth about $200 quadrillion, we will run out of it about 15 years after implementing this policy.",1384365816

Of course, I&#x27;m a bit puzzled where you derived that implication from any of my statements.<p>My original statement was simply a personal preference that I would choose not to live a life of suffering out of some romantic idea of the nobility of suffering, and that I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of people (especially those who end up on the wrong side of the statistics of various diseases) who would agree. It&#x27;s absurd to think that someone <i>should</i> want to struggle through any sort of adversity for the <i>chance</i> of making it through on the other side. The rationality of this choice would completely depend on the various probabilities involved.<p>>But if the life is so harsh that it&#x27;s not worth living, more people would commit suicide, at least those with no families.<p>This also isn&#x27;t true.

But the mechanics are all derived from very simple arithmetic, and although they don&#x27;t give you the actual formulas, they give you, up front, every single number that goes into them formulas. Use a FAQ to get the small number of formulas involved, and the randomness all but vanishes: for any given unit on the field, you can always tell exactly which other units can attack it, how many times those units can try to attack, how much damage they&#x27;ll do if they hit (and the exact odds of them hitting), how much damage you will do in response if your counterattack hits, and so on. The game will do this for you, but only for units that are directly in range at any given moment. With the numbers, you can calculate for any unit on the field, and that lets you start thinking multiple moves ahead.<p>The end result is that if you work out the math in your head, you can Neo your way through the games, and this is exactly what my wife did. I have never been the math-head in the family, but before she started this, I was still handier with numbers than she was: now it&#x27;s the other way around. I should look into this myself.",1384365670

I mean I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s never going to happen, but what a ridiculous compromise to make.<p>It seems to me judges are starting to be co-opted by the corrupt power in US, too, lately. It&#x27;s probably because many of them are starting to be given positions by corrupt administrations that are in favor of the surveillance state. This is also why I&#x27;m terrified about Obama naming any Supreme Court Justices by the time he leaves Office. The current Supreme Court is definitely not  perfect, but I think so far they&#x27;ve erred on the side of privacy. I worry that balance will change if Obama gets to name 1 or 2 Justices.<p>As an example, ACLU had a talk at 30C3 where they mention Valerie Caproni, FBI&#x27;s top lawyer until 2011, and how she was very focused on increasing surveillance capabilities for the FBI through &quot;legal backdoors&quot;. And then she was recently named a <i>federal judge</i> in New York. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this was her giving this ruling, but just goes to show how good judges are starting to be replaced by bad ones, in favor of the surveillance and police state.<p><a href""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txRdOjgokQ4&feature=youtu.be&t=20m30"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txRdOjgokQ4&feature=youtu.be&...</a>",1388571218

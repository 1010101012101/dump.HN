If I borrow some shares from my friend, and sell them (which is what shorting is) - what exactly are they supposed to do?<p>Prevent me from borrowing shares? Prevent selling shares?<p>It's between me and my friend about returning the shares to him later.<p>The only thing I can see is preventing naked shorts - i.e. sell the shares without borrowing them first, and promise to make good on it later.<p>But covered shorting? Unless you repeal capitalism, I just don't see how it's legal. Or even possible - I could make a website where people can borrow shares for a small fee. What could they do about it?<p>Can they make a law making it illegal to loan someone shares?",1221803488

308991,comment,308884,308884,0,0,UandIblog,,,"Is it possible there is no hope for MicroSoft? It just seems that competing with Apple the way that they are is the wrong move somehow. Apple has a massively powerful emotional branding philosophy in play, shouldn't MicroSoft use it's rapidly dwindling might to chase and conquer a different market? They even seem a bit late to the cloud computing party as well, sure they are involved but they let so many other firms get a foothold. It's as if Apple and cloud computing platforms are doing to Microsoft what MicroSoft did to IBM.. Am I nuts here?",1221803015

308989,comment,308332,308597,0,0,blasdel,,,"Other languages don't necessarily <i>need</i> 'real macro systems'<p>Lisp does, not just because it is so hopelessly low-level (for FP), but also because once you're using s-exprs it's hard to restrain anyone from mogrifying functions.<p>In a suitable language like Haskell where all functions are composed, using functional composition for everything instead of low-level fiddling with ""statements as data"" makes a shit-ton of sense. In Haskell you can also use supercompilation to resolve as much of the graph as possible at run time. No need for macros.<p>Don't think that other language communities want the warts from your language, just because you are so enthusiastic about them.",1221802843

You <i>will</i> have competitors, if there is a market for something, at all.  Your job is to move faster or better or both.  If you can't do that, you won't win anyway...a competitor would spring up six months, or a year, later and eat your lunch.<p>Hell, the market we started with has had major contenders in it for nine years...and many more companies have come and gone in the space than currently exist.",1221802635

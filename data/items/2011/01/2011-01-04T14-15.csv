2067136,comment,2065416,2066455,0,0,BigZaphod,,,"""I can't see any reference to underachieving in the lyrics""<p>This is what I see as a kind of reference to under-achieving by calling out and insulting people who work harder: ""Let’s have a toast for the jerkoffs / That’ll never take work off."" It seems to me that the voice is therefore showing contempt for over-achievers and, by taking the rest of the lyrics into account and the fact that I've met a <i>lot</i> of people who despise fellow employees that work harder than they do, I leap to the assumption that the voice himself must be like one of those under achieving dicks.<p>""The main speaker is most definitely talking about being a high-achiever.""<p>Others have said similar. I think the voice thinks he's ""all that,"" but in my opinion someone who feels a need to say things like this are decidedly <i>not</i> and therefore I don't agree that the voice is actually a high-achiever. It seems more like the speaker in the song is trying to justify his bad attitude by just declaring that he's the smartest/best person in the room and everyone else are idiots (as if by virtue of him saying that, it makes it true - because after all, he's so damn much better than everyone else!) - but that is <i>not</i> the mark of a truly intelligent person, IMO, and that's probably why I interpret the speaker as just being a dick. If he tried harder, tried to teach and support and didn't attempt to chase the girl away, he <i>could</i> be the smartest guy in the room. Instead, he just chases people away to make room for his ego.<p>Anyway, you could be totally right. I'm just trying to clarify where I was coming from. I would posit that in the case of interpreting art, there's no one truly ""right"" answer anyway, so it doesn't really matter - and maybe that's the point. :)",1294153180

2067122,comment,2066897,2067101,0,0,swombat,,,"Measuring session length will depend on your app. For a typical web app, what you would do is have some sort of process that updates the current session timestamp when a new user action happens. Then, another process will go through currently active sessions and automatically close those that have been inactive for longer than a certain time period. The actual time period depends on your app, of course.<p>I haven't spotted a programmer's guide to measuring these metrics.

With the sort of sites we're talking about, <i>by definition</i> that original source will be more up-to-date content which the user could reasonably expect to be presented preferentially. At which point - you're welcome to make your business from rehosting public content that originates elsewhere, but if you expect us to primarily direct people to your copy rather than the original then I think you're onto a loser.<p>Let's put it another way. I could conceivably build a valuable service by taking content from StackOverflow and Wikipedia (or wherever) and automatically linking the two to enable people to get some more context around some questions, maybe reformatting pages to enable side-by-side content or something similar. It wouldn't be a trivial service but it wouldn't be impossible in the least and it could plausibly add value. As such it wouldn't be unreasonable to preferentially direct users in some cases to that source rather than the original, as algorithmically optimised content - the preferential ranking would be a result of the value of the linking algorithm. Without this though, by what measure am I conceivably superior to the original source by having an out-of-date copy with fewer  legitimate inbound links and more irrelevant content (adverts)?<p>Being a monopoly isn't illegal. Using your monopoly power in a way that might harm another company isn't illegal.

The number of fast track tickets available are limited so the queues remain very short, and actual boarding of each ride is controlled so it is never dominated by fast track ticket holders.<p>The fast track ticket prices vary depending on which rides they are usable on, and how many times you can re-use them.<p>The system seems to work very well. Those who assign a high value to getting on every ride can opt to pay the extra for a more intense day. Those who are happy with the slow pace of a day out with some queueing can still afford the regular priced tickets.<p>There doesn't seem to be any moral or social stigma attached to those using the fast track system, but I think part of the reason is that it is perceived as fair, and everyone has the option to participate if they choose.",1294150699

Seven of them are, not surprisingly, out of business.<p>(The reason I made the list was because I watched ""Undercover Boss"" for the fourth time the other night.  The first three times were great.  This episode, about the CEO of Norwegian Cruise Lines, was horrible.  All I kept asking myself was, ""Where the hell did they get this jerk?""  He had no idea how anything happened in his company and had people and functional problems in all 4 departments he worked in undercover.  One employee even remarked that he had a problem dealing with women.  That's when I made my list.)<p>What is it about our processes in business that seems to favor assholes?  I realize that my experience may not be the norm, but some of the things I've seen done by the President or CEO:<p><pre><code>  - getting drunk and firing the security guard
  - throwing a phone book at his secretary
  - belittling vendors until none wanted the business
  - routinely yelling f words at employees
  - firing other executives on a whim
  - begging these executives to return to work
  - committing crimes with the books to earn a bonus
  - ignoring company saving advice (that would make them look bad)
  - sexually harassing subordinates
  - committing adultery (& other crimes) in full view of subordinates

2771881,comment,2770994,2770994,51,0,grellas,,,"<i>Maybe something is missing in the Valley and surrounding tech communities and thats a stronger sense of responsibility to make sure that the vast majority of the country isnt left behind by all this cool technology that were building.</i><p>And just how does one build a startup with all that such an effort normally entails while factoring in the need to make sure others aren't ""left behind"" as that startup pushes on toward a hoped-for success? This issue can't even be discussed in meaningful terms. We all, of course, share in the problems of society and we all do our bit in trying to help with such problems - and who can help but feel for those who are suffering. That is a given for most people. But what then? Do I operate my business so that it doesn't eliminate any competitor in hopes of saving that competitor's jobs for its employees? Do I refrain from introducing disruptive technologies because they might actually disrupt the lives of others? Do I ask my representatives to enact laws granting permanent subsidies to companies such as Border's, Blockbuster, Tower Records, and so many others so that they can continue in business offering products or services that people more and more don't want? Or how about passing an innovation tax to capture the all the profits of the successful tech companies so as to level the playing field? Or how about a law banning all disruptive technologies so that we can all enjoy a world that resembles the one we knew a few decades ago?<p>The point, I think, is that startups exist on their own terms in a free enterprise system. The goal of a business venture is to succeed in a marketplace, not to ensure that others aren't affected by one's activities. Nor is the goal of a venture to give away what it earns to salvage the prospects of others who are failing. <i>Individuals</i> can do that if they like, and that is an issue of private conscience on what one does with private wealth. But it is not meaningful, in my view, to tell entrepreneurs to run their ventures with the aim of solving social problems as opposed to that of succeeding in a marketplace. When you try to do that, you wind up mixing up the goals of private venturing with those of broader social institutions such as government or those of private charitable impulse. That is why even to pose the question first stated above is to expose this as flawed thinking about the legitimate business concerns of a tech company.<p>This piece is a variation on the lament expressed in the piece from a few days ago about how Silicon Valley founders and entrepreneurs are (in effect) shallow, self-absorbed types who can't think beyond the next trivial innovation in hopes of gaining a quick-kill exit even as they neglect a slew of problems that beset humanity and are crying out for solutions if only these narrow types just had a larger vision and greater sense of social responsibility (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2760540"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2760540</a> - of course, the piece had not put it in those exact terms but I hope I captured its flavor even as I used license in recasting its claims).<p>I hate to come across as narrow-minded but it really crosses a line to lecture the tech startup world about its moral responsibility as if ""it"" were a monolithic entity that had responsibilities beyond those that define what a given business venture is supposed to do. At best, this amounts to discussing the important issues in confused terms; at worst, it amounts to an author smugly claiming more refined sensibilities than the mere grubbers upon whom the author is passing a misdirected moral judgment.",1310852489

2771878,comment,2770994,2771765,44,0,nostrademons,,,"Common sense is nothing more or less than tacit knowledge that you learn <i>implicitly</i> through observing your peers within a culture.  If there's nobody in your peer group with that knowledge, that sense won't be very common.<p>Here's an example from the startup world.  Imagine that you have this great idea and you're desperate for funding.  You're approached by a key investor, and they ask you ""Is anybody else interested in your startup?  Have you been talking to other investors?""  Nobody else has expressed interest, and you haven't been talking to any other investors.  How do you respond?<p>If you spend any amount of time with successful entrepreneurs, the answer is common sense: you lie and say ""Oh yes, we're talking to a bunch of people and everyone's pretty excited.""  This is the answer the investor <i>expects</i> you to give: it shows that you know how to drum up interest in your product from nothing, and if you can't do that with him, you probably can't do it with anyone and you've just disqualified yourself in his eyes.<p>But if you grew up with a typical middle-class upbringing, this advice will seem very strange, even evil.  Because you're <i>lying</i>.  And more than that, you're lying to a powerful person about a business deal that directly concerns him.  What would your mother think?<p>It's even more complicated because there're specific, unwritten rules about what you can lie about, and nobody ever explains this.  If a journalist asks you ""Are you working on X?"" and you are, you're perfectly within your rights to lie and flat out say ""No.""  If you lie about how interested people are in your product, that's fine, and people even expect that.  But if you fudge the numbers in a due diligence audit, you're guilty of securities fraud and can go to jail for that.  It's an awfully fine tight-rope with no clear guidebook.<p>Many of the rules for jumping from the working poor to the middle class are like that.  Sure, everyone tells people to go to college and you'll get a good job.  But which college?  How are they supposed to know that University of Phoenix is nowhere near as good as, say, University of Michigan at Ann Arbor?  Or that there's a big difference between a UC-Berkeley degree and a UC-Santa Cruz one.  Who tells them that they should study software engineering rather than sports medicine?  Or maybe they miraculously find Proggit or Hacker News and hear that you should study software engineering, but don't realize that when it comes down to the actual degree program, you're often better off with Computer Science rather than Software Engineering.  Or they do all that right, get great grades, but nobody tells them that GPA doesn't matter so much and they really need to have been doing internships and helping their professor with his research to actually be qualified.<p>If you've studied academic sociology, there's a lot written about this under the general category of ""cultural capital"", particularly the work of Pierre Bourdieu.  It's all the little advantages we have simply by growing up in a peer group that's successful.  Usually you can't put your finger on these if you have them, but you very much feel their lack if you don't.",1310852420

For most places, there are two sets of exams: generals before you write a thesis and your thesis defense. In my experience, pre-dissertation general exams are significantly harder than the oral defense of a thesis. Most universities use them as a final weed-out phase before allowing people to even consider a thesis topic. As such, you have to demonstrate mastery over a far wider field than a dissertation might cover. For example, all of Math or Philosophy or English Literature or Romance Linguistics - often with chosen specialty sub-topics, so you end up having to worry about breadth and depth. By the time you get to the oral for your thesis, on the other hand, you are in such complete command of the material that defending your views (on that narrower scope) is relatively easy.<p>Also, in most cases, you won't be allowed to set a date for your dissertation defense unless the work as a whole is <i>already</i> passable.",1310850712

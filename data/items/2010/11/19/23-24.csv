Whereas now Android is a huge market that most will want to develop for, but they're not going to stop developing for iOS - so I would expect a vast majority of apps to be on both platforms.<p>Since there was never a time when Android had a large market but iOS didn', it not surprising that the only Android-exclusive Apps are ones that can't be done on iOS.",1290211104

A noob designer will get you something that looks pretty to him or her. A good designer will get you something that gets users excited, tells them what to do, and how to do it, while being accessible to all users, while being extensible, maintainable, and within the constrained imposed by your site structure, CMS, and HTML/CSS/JS. This adds a lot more value than the noob designer, without needing any more tools, just being better at them (although, being familiar enough with your framework to know what's easy and what's hard is useful).",1290210603

We've both received offers from large corporations for software development, but we're considering another offer from a new local startup incubator.  The pay there is much less than at the big companies, but it offers a unique experience - teams of students will essentially decide on a startup idea at the beginning of summer and then be paid to develop those ideas into a functioning product.<p>We think there could be unique lessons to learn at the startup incubator and we're both interested in entrepreneurship in the long-term, but we don't think it will look as good on a resume. Additionally, $520 per week salary at the incubator is much less compared to the ~$3300 per month offer from Big Company. We are conscious of the fact that in grand scheme of our lives, this difference in pay won't amount to much. There will be valuable experience at Big Company too, although the work is probably going to be less fun.<p>Our question:  Does anyone have any experience interning as a college student at either/both big companies and startup ventures?  What were the pros/cons and what did you gain from each experience?<p>Thanks for any advice you can offer.",1290210153

The rise of ""reputation"" sites like Yelp presents us with new challenges.  Previously, it was a bit easier to manage one's reputation.  A past bad act or customer complaint wouldn't be immortalized forever on the internet.  Even our own postings get archived for anyone in the future to see (and people are starting to care about what they post on sites like Facebook).<p>On one hand, this is problematic if the statements are libelous (and I'm not saying that they are in this case, but libelous statements do happen).  The Streisand effect means, to an extent, that we don't want to draw attention to libelous things said about us since it will bring more attention to them.  Whether the claim is true or false, fighting it might bring us greater harm.  And some statements are untrue.<p>On the other hand, this might change the way we view people.  Right now, we tend to think that a (singular) bad mark is indicative of a pattern.  The thought is that if someone was arrested once, they likely did many other bad acts that they weren't caught for.  Likewise, a few embarrassing photos on Facebook are sometimes thought of as evidence that someone wouldn't be a good hire.  However, if we find that more and more of our lives are documented, maybe people will stop thinking that a blemish or two on a person's record means that they're a bad person - it could just mean that they're human and interacting with the world.<p>Personally, I wonder if this fear of documentation might be holding us back.  Someone doesn't want their failure documented and so they privately don't try for something.  Has anyone else not launched something because of fear of criticism - criticism that would be immortalized online?",1290209796

1923252,comment,1923019,1923201,0,0,cheald,,,"Absolutely, I'll admit that straight away. It's very much a different expectation of how you use it, and I think that's at the core of Gruber's complaint. He is very used to the iPhone paradigm, where you engage with those bite-sized pieces and then you stop and go do something else. His complaint seems to be that Android doesn't really have bite-sized pieces like that which flatly trump their iOS couterparts, but I think it misses the point because Android isn't just an ugly iPhone, it's a completely different approach to mobile computing.<p>He's effectively asking ""Why isn't the Nexus One a better iPhone than my iPhone?"" which...just completely misses the point. The iPhone does the iPhone experience extremely well, and I don't think you'll find many people who will seriously argue that the iPhone UX isn't amazingly polished, but the assumption that it's the only way to use a mobile phone is naturally going to lead you into some completely wrong conclusions. If your whole world is the iPhone, the concept of Android intents and what they mean for how you use your phone is going to be completely lost on you.<p>I think that ""beautiful"" apps start with the platform. Most people would agree that OS X has better aesthetic sense than Windows, and most would agree that iOS has better aesthetic sense than Android. Each platform establishes a baseline for what apps should look like, and apps tend to conform to that baseline for the sake of uniformity. On Windows, the worst-looking apps are the ones that diverge from the OS baseline (I'm looking at you, iTunes and anything that uses GTK+). Android's baseline is pretty low - it's highly utilitarian and very typical of Google, which is famous for doing all of its UI design based on how things test out, and while there are some apps that diverge and look good (Twitter, Tweetdeck), there are others that are just terribly bad (Fring, for example).<p>My hope is that Gingerbread raises that baseline, and sets a new visual target for developers to hit with their apps.  We'll see.",1290209619
1923251,comment,1922306,1923007,0,0,derefr,,,"Virtue ethics and consequentialism form a one-dimensional spectrum; all ethical beliefs exist at some point along it (not to imply that ethical beliefs don't have other dimensions—just that this is one of them.)<p>Pure virtue ethics mean, basically, ""I am doing things for reasons."" Even if the the reasons don't help you to get what you want, they're still your beliefs. Pure consequentialist ethics is the classic ""the ends justify the means""; that it is the results that are important, and any reason you believe is simply a proxy that increases your likelihood of obtaining the result.<p>Whether a system of ethics is deontologically derived is orthogonal to this: you can take your beliefs from God as an a-priori fact about yourself (like in Descartes' argument for the existence of God), and therefore have them be virtue-based; or you can act so that god will reward you, or won't punish you, or so that your peer-group of religious people will identify with you, etc.<p><i>Morality</i>, in the classic definition, refers to an objectively-true ethics—e.g., one where people who don't believe those ethics are <i>wrong</i> for doing so. As far as I am aware, there is no modern religion that actually still supports moral, rather than ethical reasoning, at least when it comes to prescribing the actions of others, rather than our own internal deisions. This is what ""tolerance"" truly means: the sacrifice of a belief in the existence of objective morality for the consequence of cultural co-operation and empathy.<p>Of course, there is another, more modern definition of morality, which people think of as ""personal morality""—the way you believe the world should be, whether or not anyone else believes it. Rather than overloading the word like that, it's easier to just use a piece of economics jargon to refer to this: this is your <i>utility function</i> (a combination of what could be called ""conscience"" and what could also be called ""desire""—it is simply the part of your mind that tells you whether or not a given thing is ""good"", for any definition of the term.)<p>One of the most useful things to come into a discussion with is a set of clearly-defined terms; they're like sharp chisels for chipping off useless argument and getting to the point where you can say something that's provably true. :)",1290209593

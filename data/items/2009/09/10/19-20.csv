816042,comment,815529,815529,0,0,philh,,,"Perl was written partly as a replacement for awk, and as such it has command-line switches that make it more suitable than it might appear. You could get very similar behaviour with a much shorter implementation using `perl -nai~`, something like:<p><pre><code>    BEGIN { open(VOCAB, "">vocab""); }\n    if (!$imap{$ARGV}{$F[0]}) {\n      $imap{$ARGV}{$F[0]} = ++$I{$ARGV};\n    }\n    if (!$jmap{$F[1]}) {\n      $jmap{$F[1]} = ++$J;\n      print VOCAB $F[1] . ""\n"";\n    }\n    print ""$imap{$ARGV}{$F[0]} $jmap{$F[1]} $F[2]\n""\n</code></pre>\nWhich apart from the BEGIN line is almost a direct translation of the awk. A lot uglier, but for one-off things that isn't much of a problem.<p>(And if you want to claim awk has a three-line implementation, this is four lines.)<p>Admittedly, it's not quite the same - instead of putting output from file1 in file1n, it renames file1 to file1~ and puts its output back in file1. If you want to change that, you have to add your own file-handling code. That would only be a few lines. And it's probably never going to be as fast as mawk.<p>There are other cases where I suspect perl would beat awk, but maybe get beaten by sed. Not to rain on awk's parade or anything - it's still cool. Just not <i>that</i> much cooler than perl. :)",1252612343

The vast majority of web data is public data so encryption is of little value, and due to the way SSL works, then there's arguably little value in SSL for authentication (if someone can hack the site, they can  generally apply/install for a new SSL cert easily enough). In terms of privacy, SSL gains little - given that SSL breaks Host based virtual hosting, then accessing dodgysite.com's IP address lets a man in the middle know (almost) as much as about your browsing habits as accessing the site without SSL.<p>In terms of downside, SSL adds latency (ignore CPU time for now, it adds a further 2+ RTT times for the CLIENT_HELLO and SERVER_HELLO + cipher negotiation/key exchange on connection. Breaks (until SNI becomes about) HTTP Host based virtual servers. Breaks any web-caching by a proxy, and in many cases by the browser (most browsers don't use their disk cache for SSL content).<p>All that downside, for what upside?  Yes - for the few forms where someone submits passwords or other private data, yes. But why on earth would you want to use SSL otherwise?",1252611403

It would imply that light of frequencies other than those corresponding to the bandgap energies of the material would proceed unrefracted, or be absorbed. Furthermore, it would render coherent light incoherent, since nanoseconds are very large compared to the frequencies involved in visible light, and this incoherence would result in the light being re-emitted in every direction, not a particular refracted direction.

I certainly don't think that you have.<p>This visa was truly a miserable piece of public policy, and I think the US should regard it as a failure and try to implement something that is in the better interest of the American public as well as the people who would like to work here and would make great contributions.<p>I read a bit about Australia's points system, and I think it's a good approach.  You get points for having valuable skills, proficiency in english, and so forth.  If you exceed a certain threshold, you get a ""visa"" (I'm not sure if that's the term they use, it's a residency and work permit).  What's so cool about this system is that the visa is granted directly to the individual, so it preserves freedom.  I also like it because it doesn't single out high tech - lots and lots of different professions and trades get full points, so engineers/programmers won't feel singled out and thrown under the bus, so to speak.  While the needs of employers are a factor (a job offer adds points), it doesn't give employers control over the worker's right to reside in Australia.<p>I know you've had a bad time of the US immigration system, and anti-H1B ranters have given you plenty of opportunity to view critics of the program as anti-immigrant (and even potentially racist).   But I'm hoping you can also agree that  many US citizens who work in technical fields are legitimately outraged about abuses of this program.<p>I don't mind at all if you personally disagree that the H1B program has deterred Americans from entering the field at a time we badly need to ensure a steady supply from our own population, but I do think you should recognize that this is a reasonable point of view that can and should be debated.",1252609630

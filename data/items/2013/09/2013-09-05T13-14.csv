I thought the &quot;here is the whole map, figure it out&quot; aspect was brutal but brilliant.  Dark Souls is the modern equivalent of Zelda for NES.  You immediately have access to paths you have no business entering at the start of the game.

There&#x27;s no reason to reinvent the wheel.<p>Adding a UUID to every table as a key is a terrible idea. You bloat your primary key and every index from 4 bytes for the usual INT UNSIGNED to 32 bytes for the UUID, and replace a fast integer comparison with a slow string comparison, for every key match. That might explain the JOIN problems you&#x27;re having.<p>If you need to expose a database row ID in your URLs but want to make it tamper-proof it&#x27;s better to use a salted SHA1 or even MD5 hash along with the ID. This is a fairly common practice to protect HTML FORM fields from tampering. Even better is using PHP&#x27;s session storage so you aren&#x27;t exposing raw database IDs in the browser.<p>Throwing out JOIN means not using a relational model (it&#x27;s called unnormalized data). It may be appealing at first but it will cause duplicate and inconsistent data, and you&#x27;ll be writing application code to make your app ACID-compliant. You are unlikely to get that right -- RDBMSs have a 30 year head start on you.<p>Writing that RDBMSs are not scalabale or that SQL queries &quot;were the leading cause of website fatalities&quot; in 2012 (where did you get that from?) just advertises inexperience. Every big enterprise application and almost every big web site runs on top of RDBMSs, leveraging several decades of reliability, redundancy, optimization, and scalability experience. Do you think your bank uses Mongo or some home-rolled UUID-based system without JOINs? No, they use Oracle.<p>In my considerable experience working with broken web sites and databases (that&#x27;s what I do for a living) I&#x27;d say the leading cause of website fatalities is bad programming. If your database server is slow or crashing you should be looking at your database design and queries, not coming to the conclusion that RDBMSs suck.

Since they desire to do this, they will not accede to Mailpile&#x27;s desired world, where Mailpile gets 100% of the money on day 1 and then Paypal can seek recovery on day 120 or 365 if a chargeback comes in.  Many HNers wish we lived in Mailpile&#x27;s desired world 100% of the time regardless of merchant risk profile, but we don&#x27;t, which was the general thrust of my comment.<p>In terms of predicting Paypal&#x27;s disposition on this particular case, I think it&#x27;s a little trickier than a 90 day rolling reserve, because the product doesn&#x27;t exist and shipping is binary rather than mapping to the rolling window of binary events like a physical goods business.  If they were selling trendy iPhone cases and had bitten off more orders than they could presently chew, then an X% rolling reserve for Y days would likely be sufficient to insulate against the risk of some orders not shipping.  Software businesses can fail on day 91 in an explosive a fashion as they can on day 1, and it appears from the report of Paypal&#x27;s communication that Paypal is aware of this and is disinclined to do a fractional rolling reserve absent shipping.  One would assume that if they ship this business goes to fairly low-risk instantaneously [+] and a reserve is probably unnecessary at that point.<p>Ultimately that&#x27;s up to Paypal rather than either of our guesses.<p>[+ Well, it would be low-risk with respect to <i>new</i> orders instantaneously after shipping.  It might not be low-risk with respect to <i>pre-orders</i> for a while yet, as customers could suffer from buyer&#x27;s remorse, be dissatisfied with the product as shipped, not remember the transaction, or engage in friendly fraud, at rates substantially higher than transactions with lower delay between purchase and delivery.]",1378388464

The decision to buy any brand is voluntary.<p>As for the guy selling you a water bottle when you&#x27;re dying of thirst, it depends. What&#x27;s he asking for it? $1.00 for a bottle of water when you&#x27;re dying of thirst? -Seems reasonable. But demanding $1 million for the water would not be. Is the exchange voluntary?<p>If you&#x27;ve got two options: A) Buy water, or B) Die, it kind of works both ways. Theoretically it&#x27;s voluntary, because you <i>can</i> just choose to die instead, but in practice, you <i>would</i> do whatever it takes to get that water.<p>But what does it matter if that particular exchange is voluntary or not? Basically, you just started picking apart my original statement that &quot;voluntary exchanges are the basis of all economic activity ever&quot;, but to what end?<p><i>>> In pretty much every exchange we make there is an asymmetry of information, and that asymmetry can and is exploited to make &#x27;unnatural&#x27; gains. This is most obviously so if you reduce it to the absurd and imagine an entity that controls all information - there is clearly the possibility of coercion, in the sense of convincing you to make exchanges that you wouldn&#x27;t otherwise. Given the profit-seeking nature of our system, the possibility in the absurd case becomes a near certainty even in the limited case, as people are incentivised to manipulate each other to induce favourable exchanges.</i><p>We&#x27;re all actively pursuing our personal gain through whatever (voluntary) exchanges we decide to participate in, but it&#x27;s important to note that there&#x27;s no <i>absolute value</i> to be assigned on each side of some specific trade that&#x27;s about to occur. The value an exchange offers you is partially <i>subjective</i>, and therefore varies case by case.<p>It&#x27;s enough that both parties in an exchange consider it <i>acceptable</i>. In other words, both parties <i>perceive enough benefit</i> in the exchange to actually go through with it. Otherwise they&#x27;d just move on to find something else.<p>This works out beautifully, because a business will always sell its product to you at a price higher than what it cost to produce[1], but at the same time, you value your gain higher than the loss of your money. Both parties benefit.<p>[1] Otherwise the business would go out of business.<p>>> Given the profit-seeking nature of our system<p>It&#x27;s not the &quot;system&#x27;s&quot; nature to be profit-seeking - it&#x27;s human beings&#x27;.

6334019,comment,6333203,6333815,2,0,Xylakant,,,"> No, they are not. Financially, PayPal is the one shouldering the biggest risk.<p>Actually not. Let&#x27;s assume a chargeback rate of 100%. The donated amount was 135 000 USD, the amount PayPal handled was 45 000 USD, so the remaining backers collectively shoulder about twice as much risk as PayPal.<p>> They most likely have legal obligations in various jurisdictions and with the credit card providers to do due diligence.<p>They&#x27;re an official payment provider for IGG. I assume they know what IGG is by now and the risks associated with that. So they can either<p>a) choose to forfeit that business because it&#x27;s too risky. Fair enough.<p>b) Lay out the conditions early: Hey, we&#x27;ll take the money and keep it for a year. But would would IGG then still offer PayPal as payment provider?<p>c) eat the risk and honor the implied contract.<p>> Here you have an organization that&#x27;s effectively asking for donations to support a project, but it&#x27;s not, from what I can tell, certified as a non-profit.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s what they do. Every backer voluntarily decided to support that business. I backed kickstarter campaings because the project sounded nice and I wanted those people to have a chance to finish their project, because I thought it was a worthy thing to back. I never even touched the finished goods. A lot of open-source projects ask for donations without being non-profits, for example nginx do. Point is: everyone can decide under which conditions he&#x27;d like to support a project - certified non-profit or not, but that&#x27;s not PayPals business.<p>> So suddenly yes, that does become high risk.<p>Sure. Nobody denies that crowdfunding is not inherently risky. But see above. Either don&#x27;t participate or live with the risk. But PayPal is trying to eat the cake and still have it too: They happily took the money and kept the fees, but will neither refund it to the backers nor cash it out. That&#x27;s shady in my opinion.",1378387893

The final selling point for me was lines of code, caused by the feature-richness of Scala. While implementing a few generic data collections and algorithms I need for my project, I realized that in Go this resulted in much more code than in Scala, or I would have had to sacrifice type safety by declaring everything an interface{} (sort of Go&#x27;s version of a &quot;void pointer&quot; for C guys). I now have solved this by using Go as my favorite &quot;scripting-like&quot; language because it is so easy to bootstrap something there, and it is nice to quickly build efficient binaries and even wrap a C library. But to manage huge code bases and projects, for me the choice in the end became rather obvious. Particularly, with respect to all the magnificent capabilities starting from generics (~ C++ Templates), to higher kinds, the coming macros, etc. that help to create succinct DSLs and the general benefit &quot;FP && OO&quot;, over &quot;FP || OO&quot;, in the end made this decision obvious to me.

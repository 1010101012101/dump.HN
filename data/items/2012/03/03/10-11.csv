Some times it works great, and other times it is an intractable pain, and the browser UI is a pain, and the end user doesn't really understand it at all.  These are not high-tech people.  They don't put passwords on their keyrings, they forget they're there, they buy new computers and give the old ones away and then their new PC doesn't work and they panic!  For a small number of customers (<1%) it never really works on at least one of their PCs and I have no idea why.<p>I think it is a bit of a chicken and egg problem: no-one uses them because no-one understands them, and no-one understands them because no-one uses them.  The certificate management UI is also awful, which doesn't help.",1330772290
3659907,comment,3659461,3659653,3,0,Arelius,,,"Modern game consoles run with an OS that acts much more like a hypervisor than an actual operating system. There is a very distinct possibility that valve has choosen to develop the system components required to manage the running game, and the requisite steam services, without actually needing to take an existing off-the-shelf kernel +- any userland. Combine that with the fact that there are tons of other existing kernels which could fit the bill, BSD, l4, even darwin is out there.<p>And frankly Microsoft could be licensing them some sort of Windows variant OS. Afaik, they maintain a positive relationship with Microsoft, and other than the conflict of interest with consoles, Microsoft knows that Valve is a very powerful player in the market. Also, do recall that Microsoft has licensed out their OS before, it as a different world at the time, but the Dreamcast was using a Microsoft derived kernel.",1330772257

3659892,comment,3659461,3659839,4,0,Arelius,,,"So, the PS3 does support PSGL, but that's not actually what you are thinking of. PSGL is a GLES variant (Not exactally, iirc, GLES 2.0 wasn't out then, and GLES 1.0 didn't have the required shader support). If you wrote your game to run using PSGL, you were actually doing pretty good for a full OpenGL Port.<p>Now, you are actually in fact thinking of LibGCM, which has very few similarities to OpenGL, is much lower level, simpler, and is in fact, the library that most PS3 developers do end up using.<p>Do however keep in mind, that any major game that runs on Mobile, OS X, or Linux, has pretty much API compatible library usage with OpenGL.<p>Then while the PS3 doesn't give you OpenGL, any cross platform game that runs on both PS3 and another system generally has a graphics system abstracted enough to make porting to an OpenGL system while not trivial, a rather well contained and limited amount of work. Surely enough to make it warranted to port to whatever graphics API Valve chooses to use, should it be a successful console.<p>And frankly the Microsoft monopoly on rendering API's. These days modern OpenGL is close enough, to not really matter. Having nearly feature parity, and these days all the fancy stuff happens in shaders anyways, the API just doesn't matter as much as the platform lock-in these days.<p>Yes, the steam console doesn't automatically get access to the entire library, but keep in mind, Steam on the mac has been hugely successful, and it had a very limited selection of games to begin with. You say that valve can't get a majority of existing devs to sign-up to support OpenGL, frankly they don't have to, rather they have to get just enough Steam devs to do such, and that's something history has shown that they do in fact have influence over.",1330771747

There is, however, an <i>awful</i> lot of home-brewing even at the AAA-levels: EA's gone and thrown a lot of weight behind the Frostbite engine, Ubisoft seems quite fond of their Anvil engine (Assassin's Creed + more), and the big massive CoD franchise runs a proprietary engine too.<p>An OpenGL-only platform might automagically include all UE and idTech licensed games, but that's hardly an impressive snapshot of the gaming industry, particularly the core gaming demographic (as compared to say, the mobile gaming demographic, where OpenGL already reigns supreme). This hypothetical platform won't just leave the vast majority of Steam's existing titles in the cold, but will also have the unenviable task of forcing many devs to provide cross-platform support where none currently exists.<p>Valve is a juggernaut in the industry - but even that's a very, very tall order. There's certainly a renaissance of interest in OpenGL thanks to the mobile gaming side of things, but I'm <i>extremely</i> skeptical of claims that any player, even someone the stature of Valve, can get a majority of existing Steam devs to sign up to support OpenGL.",1330768857

His advice is like saying: you are good at tables and divs, pick one and be great. Design and front end goes hand in hand, is really hard to be excellent on one and sucky at the other.
His advice refelects two things and neither are related to you:<p>1. His view of the world is framed by specialization. You're a good pawn if i can easily put you in a box that I can understand, but is hard for me to imagine someone that s great at both things, hence you should pick one. The lack of understanding is a defect on him, not on you being too general. If you have both talents, great! Enjoy.<p>2. He is a boss, and instinctivly will try to parent you because is a non aggresive way to manage your behavior, something that he is pay to do. The problem is that kind of relationshipss are hard to let go, so he has to give you something, and whatever he gives you comes out of his vision on how the world should work.

3931772,comment,3931527,3931527,2,0,tete,,,"Can you really split it? I mean, when you think about HTML 5 you have something in between. It has so many ways to connect data/functionality with design. With HTML 4 it was like backend, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. All separated. But now you have HTML 5, you have data in code (data-attributes), lots of semantic web features, tons of JS APIs, Canvas (2D, 3D), asynchronous connections, do stuff like templates and while you can split all of this you need to know about everything. Actually it's different. You need to learn everything. If you read the HTML5 and related specs you see exactly that.<p>Of course, if it only comes to design in the pure CSS or graphics way that works, but everything that gets to HTML is different.<p>It's really hard to consider HTML(5) (that one spec, as compared to other modules) a pure markup language any longer. Of course you can use it like that, but than you won't use a lot of features.<p>So in other words. You have to become both or else you will end up very far from being excellent.<p>I also think that's even a bit of a problem. I always thought it was good to look at web design and development in separate ways, but in many cases you will end up using the tools that would fit. On the other hand that thing is also kinda true for being an administrator or developer in a way. You can get out much more if you have experience in both fields.<p>But hey, that's what happens when you work on computer stuff (or computer science if you want, but it often isn't). You have lots of pieces and levels of abstraction working together.<p>Also isn't it the best to not focus on what you learn, but just have a look what you find interesting? If it's interesting you will focus on it, learn and work quicker and you'll know what to look out for when you need a job.<p>Oh and people often switch to other languages and learn completely new things, doing completely different things and become excellent. It's not like these things are too distant from each other. So I guess it will work.<p>Okay, now instead of philosophy an answer to your question.<p>> Are there any examples of 'generalists' who have built and/or led successful startups?<p>DuckDuckGo I think.

3931770,comment,3928155,3930903,5,0,drostie,,,"(1) There is no firm distinction between the ""quantum level"" and the rest of our universe; a ""Heisenberg cut"" needs to be placed, but where it occurs doesn't matter. And quantum mechanics is multiparticle, so rather than ""countless quantum systems,"" these ""macro objects"" are a quantum system -- just one. There is a wavefunction for the universe, in principle, if you allow the clean deterministic unitary part of QM to do its thing.<p>But the quantum behavior <i>does really matter</i>. The clean part of QM says that if there's an accumulation of events which would transfer my TV into my bedroom with probability 50%, my TV is described by the state matrix  |L><L| +  |B><B|, where |B> is its state in my bedroom and |L> is its state in my living room.<p>But we don't see that state. We see |L> or we see |B>. That is the ""hardest part"" of quantum mechanics, where one insists that the above superposition describes many worlds or that there is a nonunitary wavefunction collapse or whatever.<p>(2) I don't require that the brain change the laws of physics or decide that certain waveforms collapse in any particular way. However, for reference, quantum mechanics <i>does</i> work that way, so <i>get used to it</i>. A system ""over here"" can indeed ""decide"" how a system ""over there"" will collapse.<p>If I have photons over here in a fiber-optic cable, I can perform a measurement which will change the result of a double-slit experiment over there. I can choose whether the people over there will see an interference pattern or not. In fact, I can choose whether it will happen <i>after their detectors have already measured their photons</i>. We've done this experiment, it has been confirmed, and if it weren't confirmed, QM would just be flat out <i>wrong</i>. [Theory details: start with (|00> + |11>)  (|0> + |1>), apply a CNOT from qubit 3 to qubit 2, then choose to measure qubit 1 in either the |0>, |1> basis or the |0> + |1>, |0>  |1> basis to destroy or restore the interference pattern at qubit 3. It's called a ""delayed-choice quantum eraser.""]<p>We gave up that very sentence, ""if one develops an accurate enough model of the universe, the base stuff it's made of, you can predict the future"", with the advent of quantum mechanics -- at least, in the way I think you intend it. Hey, here's a nice quantum system, it's in the state |0> + |1>. You measure it in the computational basis. <i>No matter how accurate your model is, you cannot predict which one comes out</i>. If you could, you could do experiments to prove that nature was self-contradictory.<p>(3) The problem is precisely that the ""results of the conscious process"" don't appear to be mechanical, such that we <i>can't</i> empathize with machines. It's not just ""we don't,"" but that machines are so precisely understood, and so simple, that you would have to invent a ""ghost in the machine"" and believe in weird supernatural crap to have them really <i>feel</i> anything. Hell, you probably think, for all your talk of rationality, that I really believe in ghosts -- and it's for precisely this reason. Machines seem to require a ""ghost"" inside them to feel.<p>What I want to say is different. If this supposition is correct, then applying it back to our own case poses a trilemma. Either (a) we don't really feel anything, or (b) we are not machines, or (c) we're stuck with weird supernatural crap. Of these three, (b) is the ""easy way out;"" abandon functionalism. It comes with its own problems about what we replace it with; functionalism is not easily replaced. There is an alternative (d) which is to not take the problem seriously, which many influential philosophers including Dan Dennett have made a reasonable option, but it seems unsatisfyingly to fall into the attitudes of (a) and (c) when actually practised.<p>(4) Quantum systems sometimes form higher-order excitations which escape the parallel and the serial. Electrons in parallel only flow with resistance. Electrons in series also only flow with resistance. A Cooper pair is a two-electron excitation which flows without resistance, even though its constituent electrons could only flow with resistance. It <i>requires</i> a higher-order description. That is very rare in mechanics.<p>(5) Take it one step further: classically, you aren't even the <i>pattern</i> of atoms that comprise you. That's what the Star Trek example proves. We could create two copies of this pattern classically, and there would suddenly be two distinct people in the universe. If someone pointed a gun at you and said, ""hey, we've got to kill you, we created this identical doppelganger of you down on the planet, and now we're convinced that he's the real you,"" that would seem awfully disturbing to anyone. The only reason they go along with it in Star Trek is because we kill them before they can react.<p>But quantum mechanics offers something fundamentally different. You <i>could</i> be the quantum pattern. Or, at least, the Star Trek thought experiment wouldn't suffice to disprove it. That's why one might be hopeful that there is something quantum about mind.",1336210684

It is possible to be successful by focusing on breadth as well as depth, although the challenges are different. You are the only one who can decide what is right for yourself and for the kinds of jobs you want to pursue.<p>As far as whether it's possible to be excellent at both design and development, the answer is clearly Yes -- if you have 10,000 hours to put into each of them. It's pretty hard to find a role where you can focus on two distinct areas for 10 years, but it's possible (though often when this happens, one is professional and the other is a hobby).<p>However, you should recognize that both design and development are very fast-moving areas right now, and so being an ""expert"" in one of them usually means you are good at problem-solving and you can search online competently.

Under the current, debased meaning of the word, it's trivial to be excellent at both.<p>But, to me, to achieve excellence requires becoming the embodiment of the craft. An excellent engineer, when they have a spare moment of the day, they're thinking about an engineering problem; when they encounter a problem, they analyze it like an engineer; when they cook dinner, they cook as an engineer would. They don't just merely work as an engineer, they live as an engineer.<p>And because of this, you cannot serve two masters.

3931756,comment,3931527,3931527,1,0,grey-area,,,"I consider myself a generalist, and have really enjoyed working across several domains (primarily design and programming) - it is quite possible to pursue a profitable career while not fitting entirely into the boxes that bosses and hr would like you to fit into. We've just launched a startup over at www.coolplaces.co.uk for which I did the design and programming, but I am not a reliable judge on whether it is excellent or not :) FYI I started in fine art, and have worked for a living in design and programming.<p>There are many advantages to being familiar with both programming and design, and many similarities between the disciplines at a deep level (thinking through a problem holistically, balancing constraints, incorporating and developing ideas from clients). I think those advantages more than pay for any disadvantages which come with not being a specialist in one subject. In fact knowing something about several disciplines will often help inform your work in both and allow you to bring ideas form one to another - that's why many education systems require students to pursue a broad coarse of studies alongside their more narrowly focussed specialism even in higher education.<p>As an example of cross-fertilisation helped by working on both, for design I use version control to store my work, which is a practice imported from programming which I think many designers would love to have. For most designers, the equivalent is to keep 50 files in a folder marked design-1, design-2, etc. There are also collaborative systems like ticketing systems broadly used in programming which apply very well to managing client expectations and letting clients track your work and prioritise certain bits of it.<p>Looking at present day startups, I think you could say that a startup like 37signals qualifies as having many generalists - whether you classify them as excellent or not is up to you, but they are certainly successful. For more examples, look at the banner on this website <a href=""http://designerfund.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://designerfund.com/</a> - I'm sure many of those companies contain many excellent generalists that you could take inspiration from.<p>Looking back to the past for examples, there are many many examples of polymaths who have excelled in several disciplines, like Leonardo da Vinci, who was both an excellent engineer (often overlooked), inventor, and hugely creative and influential in the art world (which he is of course famous for).  Which I'd say is definitive proof that your boss's conclusion is wrong <i>in general</i>. It is still possible your boss is right about you and your future direction, it seems unlikely if you are passionate about both areas that you can't grow in both, however it is possible that you are far more suited to one than the other and would benefit from specialising. Without seeing your work, I don't think anyone here could say.<p>Personally, I would simply take note of what your ex-boss has said, and continue to do whatever interests you, and work in areas which you feel competent in, and enjoy. If you find that throughout your career, lots of people are advising you to choose one path over another, it should lead you to either try to improve your skills in the area they highlighted as less than stellar, or move toward specialisation if you don't feel any desire to improve in that area. If your clients continue to be happy with your work in both fields, why would you feel the need to specialise?<p>I don't think you can extrapolate from this particular bit of advice to you a general statement about the possibility of impossibility of generalism, and I think given the evidence from the past, the present, and other posts on this board, the answer to your central question above:<p><i>Is it possible to become 'excellent' at both design and coding</i><p>Is a definite YES.

You can't be amazing at programming from the kernel up to the front-end and be amazing at designing from the front end all the way to marketing and UX. Reminds me of Forrst. About six of us had checked just ""developer""; seemed like almost the entire population had checked both ""designer"" and ""developer"" and were proceeding to ask really basic programming questions.<p>On the other hand, there is seemingly limitless employment for people who can both design and implement a website. But that employment doesn't pay as well as just one or the other, even though it's easier to do just one or the other. The people who need these skills wrapped up in one person need it that way because they're too cheap to hire two people. The people who can afford someone special can afford two or three someone specials. In fact, the people who need you to be both probably would like you to write the backend as well, which you've sort of implied you don't do. So if you're in the market for employment with two decent skills, you stand good odds of being outcompeted by people with one excellent skill.<p>The problem with this line of reasoning is, where do you draw the line? I think the distinction between front-end developer and designer is pretty tenuous. If I show a developer a binary tree and ask them to calculate the height mathematically, I expect to hear the answer ""log base two"" without delay. Most of the front-end developers I've met have encyclopedic knowledge of Javascript, the DOM, several JS libraries and the various browser quirks, but could not solve a pure coding challenge offline with no time limit and their choice of printed technical literature. If you fit this front-end developer profile, but can also design, you belong to an interesting and fairly small class of people who really can do essentially the entire front-end themselves. I laud these people and I'm not at all convinced that to be effective at one you have to give up on the other. On the other hand, if you're a kernel hacker on the weekend and doing front-end development and design during the week, I think the advice is probably sound. You're not going to be able to be one of these front-end wizards while also doing totally unrelated stuff.",1336210055

Similarly, you won't create an unappealing and thoughtless front-end, because you have an affinity towards--and respect for--beauty.

3931719,comment,3930782,3930782,8,0,jsz0,,,"Interesting theory but I'm not convinced the nuances of the Samsung/Apple case support it. I'm also not sold that Apple has had enough success with the legal actions against Samsung to spur such a major hardware design change especially when Samsung is simultaneously announcing a Siri clone that uses a highly derivative UI. You would have to believe Samsung is a total mess to accept they forgot to tell the software guys about the change in strategy. Just don't buy it.<p>I think the changes have a lot more to do with Samsung making a shift towards acting like the big player they are. Samsung <i>is</i> the Android market at this point. It's less about Apple  and more about HTC, Sony, Google/Motorola, etc. I think you can see this in the significant software changes they introduced and the larger display. They are making a play to basically own the Android market. It is an effort to design a device that stands out instead of blending in. I think Samsung wants people to understand at a glance this device is not just another generic handset. It's Samsung Android -- not Google Android. So physically it has to have at least a slightly unconventional look as well. That being said I think they failed terribly by adopting this sort of tacky early 00s ascetic. It's the uncanny valley of retro design. We're not far enough removed from early 00s to want a device that reminds us of that era yet. Weird textured plastic, overuse of the blue/purple tint, etc. Once glance at it and somehow I'm reminded of the first popular wave of sub-1MP camera phones in the United States.<p>The other issue is the size of the device. The Galaxy S was still within the realm of the mainstream. Not too small, not too big. They are walking away from a big portion of the market by skipping both the small and medium sized market. They now have big and they have huge with the Note. Larger devices are a nice option but the mainstream option has to be a bit more reasonable. For a significant number of people this device is just going to be physically uncomfortable to use I suspect.",1336209001

When you're writing serious systems you always have to peek under the hood -- e.g. you have to reason about data structure sizes in the JVM, or check out the code that GCC outputs, or look at the Python interpreter source code.  Having a bunch of monolithic magic with its own world view sitting between you and the machine is a big barrier.<p>I'm skeptical of anything that tries to present a grand unified model.  GWT is another example of where this strategy fails IMO.<p>As noted below, CoffeeScript is a different case that illustrates the point.  It seems moderately successful (I haven't used it) precisely because it's a such a modest abstraction.

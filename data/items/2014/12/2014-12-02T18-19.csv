8689028,comment,8687804,8688416,0,0,exelius,,,"> There&#x27;s absolutely no talent shortage in the Bay Area, provided you can pay (and your ideas are interesting)<p>There actually is a talent shortage in the Bay Area. If there was no talent shortage, prices for local labor would be lower. If there wasn&#x27;t a talent shortage, it wouldn&#x27;t be possible for me to hire a developer from India, pay to fly him out here, put him up in a hotel in Mountain View for 6 months - all for significantly less than it would cost to hire a local developer.<p>H1Bs are just the tip of the iceberg. The companies that are pros at this use L1 visas. H1Bs require you to pay a similar wage to the local wage, but L1s have no such requirement. So you can take a developer working in India for $20k/yr and ship him to the US. The consulting company charges them out at the local market rate and pockets the difference. I&#x27;ve seen projects with margins approaching 80% due to this.<p>The visa system is completely broken, this much is true. But it&#x27;s really a symptom of the fact that the labor market in the US is not training the types of workers it needs. We train a lot of developers and many of them think they&#x27;re rock stars. But the reality is that we need a deep bench of competent developers willing to work for substantially less than $100k a year. Those developers exist in other countries, and so the work is going there.",1417546760

And even though they are far from being pure open source, they do contribute back to the community in multiple ways, for example with contributions to the Linux kernel and open source projects like Chromium and Go. And then there are projects like Qt, that mix open source tools with enterprise support.<p>But I think that the field of IT is still extremely young and that in the future larger companies will discover that collaborating on open source platform and infrastructure projects will give them much better synergy effects and lower IT costs by removing the license cost and at the same time lowering the support cost.

All salaries must be compared to that of senior engineers or higher.<p>That&#x27;s when the real &quot;need&quot; shows up and that will weed out the bogus H1-B gamers and get real value from it.

8688999,comment,8686802,8687230,0,0,hyp0,,,"Not sure it helps, but an observation is that Oracle&#x27;s relational database occupied a somewhat similar role, in that it tied together data from different sources, and enabled cross-platform interoperation. This was very important at the time, because there were several different hardware vendors, and companies didn&#x27;t want to get locked in. And of course, a whole ecosystem of third-party tools grew up around Oracle - esp reporting tools, BI, warehousing, and everything had bindings for relational databases.<p>Not sure how that translates as a business model, as no one owns git (like Oracle owned oracle). However, although Sun didn&#x27;t make money from java, <i>everyone else did</i> - so there is a business model, just as a user of git, not an owner. e.g. reporting tools based on git; CI tools, code quality tools.<p>So maybe the answer is to just to treat git as infrastructure, for the app you sell, as opposed to trying to make money from the infrastructure itself.

You might just qualify for some visas just because of the area you&#x27;re working on (there is something for academic for H1b that&#x27;s exempt from the cap).

Normally, cycles are &quot;collected&quot; in PHP by just waiting until the request is done and ditching everything. That works great for web sites, but makes less sense for a command line app like Composer.<p>To better reclaim memory, PHP now has a cycle collector. Whenever a ref-count is decremented but not zero, that means a new island of detached cyclic objects <i>could</i> have been created. When this happens, it adds that object to an array of possible cyclic roots.<p>When that array gets full (10,000 elements), the cycle collector is triggered. This walks the array and tries to collect any cyclic objects. They reference this paper[1] for their algorithm for doing this, but what they describe just sounds like a regular simple synchronous cycle collector to me.<p>The basic process is pretty simple. Starting at an object that could be the beginning of some cyclic graph, <i>speculatively</i> decrement the ref-count of everything it refers to. If any of them go to zero, recursively do that to everything they refer to and so on. When that&#x27;s done, if you end up with any objects that are at zero references, they can be collected. For everything left, undo the speculative decrements.<p>If you have a large live object graph, this process can be super slow: you have to traverse the entire object graph. If there are few dead objects, you burn a bunch of time doing this and don&#x27;t get anything back.<p>Meanwhile, you&#x27;re busy adding and removing references to live objects, so that potential root array is constantly filling up, re-triggering the same ineffective collection over and over again. Note that this happens even when you aren&#x27;t <i>allocating</i>: just assigning references is enough to fill the array.<p>To me, this is the real problem compared to other languages. You shouldn&#x27;t thrash your GC if you aren&#x27;t allocating anything!<p>Disabling the GC (which only disables the cycle collector, not the regular delete-on-zero-refs) avoids that. However, it has a side effect. Once the potential root array is full, any new potential roots get discarded. That means even if you re-enable the cycle collector later, those cyclic objects may <i>never</i> be collected. Probably not a problem for Composer since its a command-line app that exits when done, but not a good idea for a long-running app.<p>There are other things PHP could do here:<p>1. Don&#x27;t use ref-counting. Use a normal tracing GC. Then you only kick off GC based on <i>allocation</i> pressure, not just by mutating memory. Obviously, this would be a big change!<p>2. Consider prioritizing and incrementally processing the root array. If it kept track of how often the same object reappeared in the root array each GC, it can get a sense of &quot;hey, we&#x27;re probably not going to collect this&quot;. Sort the array by priority so that potentially cyclic objects that have been live in the past are at one end. Then don&#x27;t process the whole array: just process for a while and stop.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://media.junglecode.net/media/Bacon01Concurrent.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media.junglecode.net/media/Bacon01Concurrent.pdf</a>",1417546170

Their contribution to the actual scientific process is small, and purely based on their preexisting reputation. It&#x27;s because scientists in the first place submit their papers there that they hold that position. They do pick out good reviewers, for the same reason. Since they dont really have a say in peer review, their contribution ends in typesetting and printing (do people actually ever use those printed volumes?). And to be honest that&#x27;s even changing, i spot many great articles (granted, most of them reviews or &#x27;companion&#x27; papers) in many different journals.<p>For scientists, the value of the journals is the reviewer&#x27;s comments, who spot errors, make useful suggestions etc. Correct me if i m wrong, but we&#x27;ve gotten excellent and extensive reviews from mid-range IF journals.

The San Francisco-based business, founded in 2010 by Irish brothers Patrick and John Collison, is the latest tech start-up to benefit from soaring valuations. It follows an $80m fundraising in January that valued the company at $1.75bn and will help with expanding into more countries and new areas of online commerce.<p>The company provides online retailers with technology that enables them to accept payments through their app or site. Only a fraction of retail spending happens online, however. In the US, ecommerce represents less than 6 per cent of the market.<p>Patrick Collison said Stripe’s goal was to improve the complex infrastructure for online payments.<p>&quot;There’s commerce that could be happening and isn’t happening today,&quot; he said.
Stripe has tapped into changes in the ecommerce sector this year, driven by the rise of mobile and social network commerce.<p>Apple tapped the company as one of a small number of launch partners for Apple Pay, its mobile payment service. Stripe has also linked-up with Facebook and Twitter as they launched features to enable users to buy products that they see featured on the social networks.
Stripe this year worked with Alipay, the payments partner for Alibaba, the Chinese ecommerce group, to help online retailers outside of China accept payments made by Chinese consumers.<p>&quot;People were previously being kind of unambitious about what was possible, and now through things like the buy buttons on Twitter and Facebook or enabling Alipay, I think people are starting to see what might be possible,&quot; Mr Collison said.
Investors in the round include Sequoia Capital, General Catalyst, Founders Fund, and Khosla Ventures, as well as Thrive Capital. The company is still sitting on much of what it raised in January, but it wanted to &quot;err on the side of being really well-capitalised&quot; in case markets cool down, Mr Collison said.<p>Stripe is far from the only tech start-up whose valuation has risen precipitously this year as investors and founders make the most of the industry’s boom times. Ride-hailing app Uber is in talks to raise $1bn at potentially double the $17bn it was valued at in a June round.

You simply can&#x27;t get enough of these people locally. These go to Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc;<p>2. Cheap labour for bodyshops.<p>The problem here isn&#x27;t (1) but (2). IMHO the problem has two primary causes:<p>1. Prevailing wage determinations are a joke; and<p>2. Lack of mobility, particularly the essentially indentured servitude system that is employer sponsored permanent residency.<p>The last is particularly important. The queue for green cards is based on country of birth and some countries have deep queues, particularly China, India, the Phillipines and Mexico.<p>The way it works is you can have a 3 year H1B twice for a total of 6 years. If your employer starts the green card sponsorship at least a year before your (final) H1B expires you can stay indefinitely. You cannot then move employers or, to some degree, have significant changes in job responsibilities. You can&#x27;t move (geographically) either.<p>Green card sponsorship works in essentially two phases.<p>The first is LC (labor certification). This is where the queue and per-country quotas exist. Depending on category, if you&#x27;re from India you might be waiting 5-7+ years for this.<p>The second phase is essentially automatic and takes 6-12 months.<p>Now the LC phase has some huge variables. You can get randomly audited (DOL estimates 30% of LC applications will be audited and they randomly audit some so employers don&#x27;t game the system, so they claim). Those audits can lead to further questions. This cycle can (and does) continue for years in some cases.<p>All this time the employee simply cannot move and has absolutely no bargaining power with their employer.<p>The solution here is to give employees mobility and make green cards essentially automatic after a given period of employment, combined with no limits on H1B renewal. If you still want a per-country quota (and that sounds like something the US would continue to want), then after, say, 3-5 years on work visa you automatically enter the queue for permanent residency and when your number comes up, you just get it.<p>Fact is, many foreigners are willing to work for essentially slave wages in the hopes of a better life for them and their children. The current system isn&#x27;t slavery in the classic sense but I&#x27;d certainly call it indentured servitude.<p>As for the idea that &quot;they&#x27;re stealing our jobs&quot; [tm], let me just add my personal perspective as someone who&#x27;s interviewed:<p>There are <i>many</i> people out there masquerading as programmers/engineers who have utterly no business drawing a paycheck for such. I&#x27;d even go so far as to say the <i>majority</i>. People who can actually program are in high demand, regardless of country of origin and they&#x27;re simply aren&#x27;t enough of them. Employing them from overseas does not (IMHO) hurt local talent. Demand exceeds supply.<p>Even bodyshops are a symptom. Many companies, particularly Fortune 500 companies and governments at every level, are willing to accept high-priced inccompetence-to-mediocrity that is the norm for &quot;consultants&quot; and vendors.<p>This isn&#x27;t a zero sum games.<p>The real long term danger is that the US, as a whole, seems to take their preeminence in technology as a given. At some point you&#x27;ll reach a tipping point where it just makes sense to invest in technology elsewhere. We&#x27;re not there yet. Far from it. But it could happen.<p>In 1800 the US had a population of ~2M. In 1900 it was ~50M. In those 100 years the US transformed from an agrarian backwater to an industrial superpower largely on the back of immigration.<p>I understand the desire to shut the doors. This is pervasive at every level from immigration to the ridiculous NIMBYism that is rampant in the Bay Area. It&#x27;s ultimately short-sighted however.",1417545653

You substitute sq ft with other goods. If you place relatively heavy utility on housing by sq ft in comparison to all other goods, then I guess it&#x27;s a bad idea to come out here, because you&#x27;re going to be on a lower indifference curve.

I would agree with you generally that America is probably the most open country even with its challenges but I am not sure if your point is relevant in the context of immigration. Here is why. Immigrants come to America for many reasons. Your dad&#x27;s was not wanting to bribe for every little thing and probably many other factors like that. But in my experience, most immigrants are just looking for better opportunity and america provides that. It is hard to objectively quantify their virtues, beliefs etc.<p>So what I am getting at is that your point seems ok in theory but very difficult to implement in reality. If you want to restrict immigration, it certainly cannot be done based on perceived virtues. Plenty of immigrants assimilate in the local culture while plenty preserve their own at the same time. Nothing wrong with both as long you are not hurting anyone. In fact, what makes America special is you could look different, speak different, eat different but at the end of day, you are American as long as you have some common core beliefs including hard work, take nothing for granted, the drive to succeed and the perception of self independence.",1417544567

How far from your original job title did you drift when you changed jobs?  The H1B could be seen not so much as a way of forcing people to remain with one company as it is a way of forcing people to work the kind of jobs silicon valley employers want them to work.

Suppose you decided, at age 25, that you&#x27;d prefer to do dental hygiene, since you were concerned about possible age related employment issues.  Would you be allowed to do that as an H1B holder?

The lower level technology of containers solved one set of complexities (app deploy onto 1 operating system), but they also create new complexities:  tame the explosion of a thousand containers in the data center.<p>How is this different from MS System Center, HP OpenView, and IBM Tivoli as managers/watchdogs of Windows & Linux boxes or KVM-over-ip to remotely reboot/powercycle racks of servers?  Yes, those &quot;enterprisey management console&quot; products are &quot;value added&quot; and successful. Yes, there was competition between OpenView & Tivoli and competition between KVM vendors.  But they weren&#x27;t the kind of products that captured mindshare as glamorous; it was just something the IT department picked to &quot;keep the lights running&quot;.    Those management products also did not mint billionaires (millionaires yes, but not billionaires.)  So the recent analysis from blogs that pits Docker vs CoreOs as a &quot;strategic-winner-take-all&quot; platform war like Internet Explorer vs Netscape doesn&#x27;t feel quite accurate.<p>It seems like the more interesting software fight is <i>datacenter cloud o/s</i> which is even higher level than Docker&#x27;s orchestration-of-containers focus.  Example of this would be OpenStack[1].  Proprietary ones would be Facebook internal cloud stack and Amazon AWS.  This &quot;datacenter-as-a-platform&quot; would subsume the container standards fight.<p>There may be something I&#x27;m missing in the Docker vs CoreOS that makes me discount this competition while others are playing it up.  For example, is there some plugin architecture that would lock in developer mindshare?<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack</a>",1417544169

Bitcoin is a bit like that, too, both because of the type of crowd and because people are eager to spend and use bitcoin and to support charitable organisations that participate in the bitcoin ecosystem.<p>Lastly, it&#x27;s an interesting angle because payment processing costs 0% for charities, yet the payout is in dollars, euros or a bunch of other currencies including bitcoin (just like for any other business btw if you use Bitpay)<p>It very much seems like charity is one of bitcoin&#x27;s biggest usecases at the moment.

I had a slightly higher budget than OP because I wanted something reasonably high-end, able to run several VMs for example, but nice and portable.  So, in case anyone else finds it useful:<p>- probably the most sensible choice would have been a fully specced-up Galago from System 76:  16GB ram, core i7, space for two (!) SSDs, etc etc.  On the pure specs, it&#x27;s the clear winner -- it&#x27;s practically impossible to find an i7 in 13 inches with 16 gigs of RAM. And it&#x27;s great to support a Linux-friendly company. One minor problem was that I do occasionally need Windows (for Powerpoint), but I guess I could have installed it.  The real reason I didn&#x27;t go for it (and I&#x27;m about to betray a character weakness here) is that I saw it in real life and... I thought it was too ugly.  Didn&#x27;t suit my vanity.  And I couldn&#x27;t get on with that weird screen hinge.  Still, my mate Hansel wrote an excellent review of the Galago, check it out here: <a href=""http://aychedee.com/2014/01/04/galago-ultrapro-review/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aychedee.com/2014/01/04/galago-ultrapro-review/</a><p>- the other sane choice would have been a thinkpad.  As this thread overwhelmingly proves, they have an excellent reputation, and should work well under Linux.  My dad has one, and I can confirm that they feel really well built, and are nice and light.  Only real tech problem is the X240 is limited to 8GB.  That and the seriously weird touchpads, which depress down about 5mm with a big ker-chunk, they feel like they were designed for use by children on a button-bashing arcade machine to launch nukes or something.  But I can imagine getting used to them.  Also briefly considered getting an X230 off ebay, because 16GB, but screen resolution was seriously weak.<p>- another option would have been a Dell.  They have a good rep, and good linux support, but the XPS13 suffers from the same problem of the 8GB limit, and the XPS15 was too big -- a friend of mine tells me it feels a little heavy, and that the lid feels a bit feeble -- so the build quality isn&#x27;t as good as the thinkpads.  The 15 would be a good option for someone prepared to carry something a little heavier tho, 16 gigs and excellent resolution.<p>- at this point I started casting around for other solutions, and in the end I did something completely irrational.  I came across the Samsung Ativ Book 9 Plus, and despite its stupid name I kinda fell for it.  So I&#x27;ve impulse-bought one on ebay for about $1000 (new).  And this despite the fact that Ubuntu is absolutely not ready for HiDPI screens, and that all the info on getting Linux installed on them sound like it&#x27;s a nightmare, and that it&#x27;s just never going to work.  But, heck, I feel like Linux on the Desktop is <i>meant</i> to be hard, and not quite work.

Some of these kids could be working in 2 years (probably before any legislation would actually go through). Bring them to the Facebook or Google offices and get them interested and motivated. Finally, ensure that they can actually have at least a median paying job in the field.<p>I think we should look at coding like vocational schools. You see all those programs about getting a degree to repair cars. What about getting degrees to do QA and code? It works in Germany very well, especially for kids who don&#x27;t go to college.

It was so egregious at some places that HR would go as far as to get the exact list of skills from the H1B they wanted to hire and then tailor a job posting to that exact list of skills in order to disqualify local applicants.<p>Could you and others give us the names of these companies? I&#x27;d be very interested to know if such abuse is seemingly random or tends towards a certain kind of company, because I have my suspicions that it&#x27;s the latter, and simple legislation could easily be passed to prevent that.",1417543408

There was a report that these consultancies have about 25% -  33% H1Bs quota each year. They are the ones who get large margin by paying employees cheap, even though on paper these employees could get much higher from &quot;customer companies&quot;. And you know how they work? My friend spent 2 weeks at a consultancy, and they gave her some projects to MEMORIZE while they were polishing her resume. They have bunch of customers, so one memorizing can be used for many interviews! True story. The government should fix this first!",1417543362

Meanwhile, many other H1B hires are paid the same as citizens, if not better, especially when they&#x27;re hired by a local company directly.",1417543329

8688597,comment,8685701,8685961,0,0,oppositelock,,,"Shadow volumes have a number of disadvantages. You have to create geometry for every shadow casting object and for every light source for which it casts a shadow, this is a lot of geometry and a lot of CPU overhead, so you generally used them for static lights and only shadowed moving objects that crossed the light cone. These days CPU doesn&#x27;t matter as much, but back in 2000 it was a big deal. It was hard to solve the problem in a general way, and you ended up asking your modelers to tag which objects could be shadow casters, which could be shadow receivers, and which lights corresponded to the shadows.<p>Shadow maps are faster and compounding shadows is much easier. What you do is render the subset of the scene that you want casting shadows from the point of view of each light source that you want casting shadows, and then render the entire scene once for each light, using the shadow map to kill fragments that aren&#x27;t illuminated. Back in the late 90&#x27;s and 2000, you could potentially have one, maybe two shadow maps. The downside is resolution, but you can play tricks with the projection matrix to bias the pixellation artifacts into more distant areas.<p>Pre-computed shadow volumes were awesome for static lights, where you didn&#x27;t have to pay the geometry compute overhead every frame, and shadow maps were awesome for things like flashlights and moving lights, since they allowed moving the shadow compute complexity to the GPU. When the Riva TNT2 came out, and you could multi-texture, shadow map performance doubled.<p>Lighting is hard! If you have 2 shadow-map shadow casters, and one shadow volume, you&#x27;re rendering the scene at least 5 times and the shadow volume twice, using the geometry processor to kill front or back sides from the point of view (can&#x27;t pre-compute this).<p>(I&#x27;ve been working on this stuff since the 90&#x27;s. SGI was doing this stuff years before games, but it just wasn&#x27;t well known because nobody could afford those damn things, it took cheap 3D commodity hardware to make this work really fun, well, minus the whole thing about it sucking to work in the games industry.)",1417543201

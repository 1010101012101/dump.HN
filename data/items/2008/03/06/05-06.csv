130357,comment,130191,130208,0,0,dkokelley,,,"Take a look at Google's Adsense and Adwords terms of service. These are pretty much the standard that similar ad models follow. Stating the percentage is similar to a retail store telling everyone what their profit percentage is. If you try walking into a store and asking ""How much did you pay wholesale for this?"" you will probably not get the nicest response. It's a trade secret for them. This is why your advertising earnings can't really be broken down like that. Imagine if you found out that Google took 75% of revenue from ads on your site. It's the same as finding out that your hardware store charged you $10 for a hammer that cost them $2.50.<p>Some ad networks are more transparent with their rates. They'll tell you right away ""50% goes to us, and 50% goes to you."" but it's not required and it looks like the service you want to use doesn't do this.<p>You could try buying ads for your own game and see how much you receive vs. how much it cost you. Just make sure that you don't get caught :P Some companies don't allow this, so if you are going to do this, have a friend do it or use a different account.",1204782800

130353,comment,129910,130258,0,0,thinkcomp,,,"It depends what you need done. Any corporate lawyer should be able to handle an incorporation or vesting documents. They'll probably just hand it off to a lower-paid associate (or if they don't, ask them to), so it almost doesn't matter who you hire. They won't be doing the work. It does matter that you trust them so that you're not surprised when the bill comes. On the other hand, if you find yourself needing a criminal defense lawyer for a specialized case at the last minute, you might very well find yourself paying that hypothetical $800 per hour attorney.<p>In worst case scenarios, you can always harass law school professors, who are sometimes amused by the interesting travails of undergraduates and non-law graduate students.<p>Basically, just pray you never need to hire any of them.",1204782520

Crap executed brilliantly is still crap.<p>> and you can't pay developers to work on your idea<p>Actually, the money's not the problem.  I can raise the money but I'd like to put a demo together as I imagine that would get far better terms.  But ultimately if all else fails I'll get the money and hire.  My only thought was that I'd prefer to share with a good technical partner that I worked well with than keep a lot and ""hire"" as you put it.<p>> In six years you could have learned to program well \n> enough to build a kickass demo--the fact that you\n> haven't makes it pretty clear to developers that you \n> don't believe in your idea enough to commit your own \n> time to it (other than, apparently, thinking really hard > about it)<p>In six years I spent most of my personal time single-handedly researching and interacting with something that it's now taking, from what I was told, a starting team of about 15 IBM research guys to just to <i>START</i> looking into.  And that part is only half the total idea.  They'll never in 10 years get to the second part.  When exactly was I supposed to find the time to program on top of this?\nNot to mention that it wasn't immediately obvious that it would even be feasible.  And as for ""committing my own time to it"" ... I think actively researching it for 6 years is a lot of time to commit to anything, considering I got no financial/academic/professional compensation/recognition.<p>> ...but you'd be really happy to have someone else commit > time to it and share the results with you.<p>Share the results with me?  So let's see ... I came up with it, spent years researching the feasibility of it, the market is huge, and I have the connections to get financing, and somebody who'd code it would be ""sharing the results with me?""  Wow.  Does it get lonely up there on your pedestal?<p>You don't have to commit time to it.  But that's what startups are about - they're not for everyone, but some people decide, ""this is a good thing to commit time to"".  And they wouldn't be doing it ""for me"" they'd be doing it for the ""results"" as you put it, none of which would be possible if I didn't explicity explain what they should be commiting their time to in the first place.<p>> Hell, with the quality of modern tools, if you started \n> today, you could have a proof of concept running in a \n> year<p>You inspire me!  Hell, if I start today, maybe in a year I can learn enough about combustible engines and transmissions to tell my mechanic to shove it.<p>And in a year I'll be having back surgery.  Maybe if I get started today, I can learn enough about the human body and related surgical proceedures to tell my surgeon to go shove it.<p>Come to think of it, why did I just waste all this money on an Apple computer.  I should pocket the money, learn to build my own computer from scratch, and tell Apple to shove it.<p>Hell, why did I buy these jeans?  I should have grown some hemp and made my own pants.  That would show Levis!<p>> in trying to get someone to write your software for you, > for free.<p>""For me for free"" would mean you write it, I keep all the equity and I use the subsequent investment I can get with my personal contacts to pay myself a hefty salary.<p>I'd imagine there would be some equity exchange and any subsequent investment follow-on would be split, hence it's not ""for me"" its for themselves.<p>And since I'm not a programmer and this is not college, it's not ""my software"" as if though it was a homework assignment or something.<p>> But, an engineer hears, ""I've done nothing but have \n> super cool ideas for the past six years, and now I'd \n> like you to implement my vague and over-reaching \n> specifications into a product, for free, and share the \n> results with me.""<p>Well, where to start.  First, considering all the crap on the internet, I'd say having a really cool idea is a good start.  It's better than most people have had so far.  As for ""my vague and over-reaching specifications"" I think you're having a flashback of some bad work experience here.  I never gave you any specifications, specific or vague, so I don't know what you're refering to.  And I'd imagine it to be a two way street where specifications would be arrived at as a result of communication, continuously, back and forth.<p>As for the ""for free"" part, see above.  As for the ""and share the results with me."" part ... well, I'll tell you what.  I'll keep my idea and financial contacts to myself, and you can keep all the results you get from not working with me on this idea all to yourself while I keep looking for other people.  That way you make all the big bucks all by yourself.  Don't spend it all in one place ...",1204781696

130335,story,,,7,10,adammichaelc,"10x Client Productivity Start-Up",,"I've got an idea for a software startup and wanted to get some feedback. I'm talking to a potential partner -- bouncing ideas back and forth.<p>We know what the problem is. Startups and even more established companies don't have the tools they need to create systems that work so that they can maximize productivity. Think ""Franchising the startup and small business world.""<p>In other words, there's no software that is designed to increase productivity -- to put powerful systems in place that stop negative inertia and establish a ""creative and chaotic order,"" if you will.<p>Sure, there's google app's and there's Basecamp and Attask. But are these programs really about productivity? Think about it. What is productivity? How is it defined? How is it measured? Do these programs increase it?<p>As far as I can tell, no company in America is focusing on the heart of the productivity problem. And the software tools that are supposedly about ""productivity"" are really about ""collaboration and goal-setting.""<p>Collaboration and goal setting may be a part of productivity, but only a small part.<p>What we have so far for our overarching company purpose is that we want to 10x client productivity. We see productivity as a product of at least three things.<p>1. Happiness. You've got to love what you're doing to be productive. In other words you've got to be working within your values, within a frame of reference that inspires the heck out of you. We call this the iBeam effect. (If you haven't heard the iBeam story, it's awesome! I can't take up the space to write it here, but believe me -- it's really cool)<p>2. Theory of Constraints. A book was written all about this theory. The book's called The Goal by Eli Goldratte. My friend had the perfect explanation for the book, ""Raw energy."" I agree. It is written by a physicist that comes at business productivity from a scientist's perspective. It's written as a novel about a plant manger that is forced to either increase productivity or lose his job. It's very informative. Every founder should read it.<p>3. Finally, the software. Once we know exactly how to solve the problem, we will map out exactly what our software will do. It may have some of the features that project management software currently has, it may not. But the key aim of the whole endeavor -- 10x client productivity.<p>Measuring productivity. Although productivity encompasses the three points mentioned above, we are going to need something more concrete to measure it. So we decided to measure it in terms of either money or products delivered.<p>In other words, if a client  puts into practice the education and tools we give them, they should 10x either A. The money they make in terms of net income or B. The number of products they're able to ship / produce. We haven't decided which would be the better of the two to go with.<p>The two revenue streams we'll have are: \nA. Recurring revenue from software subscriptions and \nB. Sales of the educational tools we'll offer (interactive educational video presentations covering key concepts).<p>We want to give away some (or all) of it away for free to startups and have our paying customers be the more established small businesses.<p>Books that are inspiring us:\nArt of the Start - Guy Kowasaki\nThe e-Myth Revisited - Michael Gerber\nThe Goal - Eli Goldratte\nThe Innovator's Dilemma - ?<p>We're still working out all the details, and this post isn't even the half of what we have discussed.<p>What do you think? Any comments? Suggestions?",1204779706

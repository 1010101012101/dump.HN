It is often inspired by his lack of affections for women, and the fact that Eva Braun was the only he ever really got close to.  But the truth is more likely that Hitler was asexual than homosexual.<p>As for Mao, I don't think most of us knows about his personal life.  So that is probably hindering the speculations.<p>And why do you consider Kennedy a great leader?",1368608391

It has ""near"" stock Android. There are a few minor things such as custom apps to check for system updates from the manufacturer, and some stuff that I'm not sure whether is stock or an extension for handling multiple sims (don't know as I've never had another phone with multiple sim slots).<p>Other than that, the GPS is pretty much useless but not for lack of trying - there's extra stuff there to facilitate AGPS etc. it seems, but the antenna is simply physically too short (there's lots of breakdowns on how to attach a longer antenna to fix it, but I've not bothered so far - I don't use GPS much).<p>Lots of companies <i>are</i> importing many of these devices. Amazon is full of them. They're also full of offers from distributors and manufacturers in China that offers a quite decent service. I'm in the UK, ordered mine via Amazon mostly for increased peace of mind vs. ordering direct, and had the phone in ca 10 days.<p>I've also ordered several cheap no-name Chinese tablets via UK distributors.<p>You'll probably see more and more of these appearing, especially as all of these manufacturers offers to put your own brand name on the devices often even in very small volumes (if you want a Samsung logotype or other known brand, you can probably get it at no extra cost from most of them when ordering even single units...)",1368608350

The rest of the European-model social welfare state <i>would</i> be possible in the US if we didn't blow so much more than putatively 'military independent' allies on our military, and if we hadn't developed the popular culture we needed to justify that spending in opposition to ""Communism"".

But there's any number of acceptable way it could find them: Some of the tools I use have default setups of Google Analytics that'd leak any urls I visit on them; I often click through links to other public sites from them, and any of those sites might leak the referrer.<p>So I agree with you that you should expect that URLs stay private.<p>But you can still have privacy expectations about the <i>exchange</i> of a public URL. E.g. someone might not like the thought that there is potentially a record that they're visiting certain embarrassing sites.<p>The reason there is a shitstorm over this is not that Skype is necessarily or even likely doing anything nefarious with the URLs, but that people had an expectation of privacy about their conversation that they then found out clearly is not being met.<p>If Skype/MS wants to scan every link, or retrieve them and put the contents on billboards in public spaces, there's nothing inherently wrong with either option.

I think there' a distinction between this and a bot operating in a private communications channel.<p>>I think the better choice here is to ensure that the public has a way to communicate securely and that our mental model of ""trust usually, distrust as the exception"" needs to move to ""distrust usually, trust as the exception"".<p>I can't square this with your previous stance easily. This would for me imply that private communicates should have end-to-end encryption.

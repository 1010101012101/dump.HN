9630750,comment,9625048,9627046,0,0,tmalsburg2,,,"There is a reason why human languages evolved to have syntactic ambiguity: better throughput.  Psycholinguistic research is obsessed with syntactic ambiguities (and there are good reasons for that) but in real life these ambiguities are pretty much always resolved by other sources of information: context, prosody, world-knowledge, social cues.  If you disambiguate a language on the syntaxtic level you&#x27;re basically just adding excessive redundancy.  There are special niches where disambiguating information is scarce or where any misinterpretation could have catastophic consequences (e.g., aviation handbooks) but outside these domains the absence of syntactic ambiguity is hardly a desirable property.",1433004873

In fact it starts with a misunderstanding:<p>> All the purported benefits of dynamic linking (aka., ‘shared libraries’, which is a misnomer as static linking also shares libraries) are myths while it creates great (and often ignored) problems.<p>The &quot;shared&quot; in in &quot;shared libraries&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean two programs use the same instruction sequences, it means that the code is mapped into physical memory once and multiple process share that page (perhaps mapping it into different part of their own virtual address space.<p>The sharing the cast-v author is talking about is de minimis.  e.g. every compiled c program on your machine includes the same implementation of _start that sets things up and calls main() but we don&#x27;t call that &quot;shared&quot;.  Likewise all the internal intrinsics (architecture-specific implementations of things like memmove()) -- they are all statically compiled into the binary.<p>Shared libraries were designed to solve several problems, some of which still exist:\n - reduce the size of programs (less relevant since disks and RAM are big)\n - reduce ram footprint / reduce paging (arguably less relevant but basically still really important)\n - be able to update all programs with common features.<p>It&#x27;s the last that is still crucial and which causes so many problems.  When, say, there&#x27;s a security problem in Webkit, an updated version of the webkit code can be installed, immediately (well, upon restart) providing that fix to all programs that used Webkit.  Otherwise the end user / in house deployer would need to recompile every program that used Webkit (even if they could figure out what those were) and redeploy them all.<p>There are in fact plenty of special case reasons to use static linking, but most of the arguments against dynamic linking don&#x27;t stand up to scrutiny.

I am not going to tell you a sorry.<p>The essence of my answer first: You <i>can</i> heal yourself. The body follows the mind. First there is reality in your head, and then in the physical world.<p>Second, read the book by Dr. Joe Dispenza, called &quot;You are the placebo&quot;. If you have a bit of patience, read the two earlier books mentioned there (&quot;Evolve your brain&quot; and &quot;Breaking the habit of being yourself&quot;).<p>I have read a lot of books, covering spiritualist topics, healing, taoism, traditional chinese medicine, ritualist magic and psychology as an overall topic. The essence is, that what we call the rules of physics and medicine today are short-sighted and often plain damaging. One example for this is the belief that you can&#x27;t change certain things.<p>Denying your own possibilities when they exist is a self-fulfilling prophecy, you cannot disprove it if you don&#x27;t <i>really</i> believe in it. Doctors telling you that you have a serious illness (or just in the risk of becoming ill) are doing serious damage to you if you believe them, because your mind is making it real.<p>Illnesses are an expression of something going wrong, which means you have to fix it by changing how you live, what you do, and essentially, who you are. I have had some minor illnesses such as cavities and hay fever, both of which I fixed using meditation and visualization.<p>The books I mentioned show a practical way for us people today who essentially believe science to be &quot;true&quot;. It builds upon that belief, and I can really recommend it if you don&#x27;t have time wrapping your mind around ancient chinese belief systems.<p>The reason I was not going to tell you a sorry is that I don&#x27;t feel sorry for you, I feel hope and I feel gratitude - there is a reality (which implies it is <i>real</i> and exists right now) in which you are 100% healthy, and giving your experiences of <i>becoming healthy</i> out to the rest of the world. It is possible, and it is your choice. I am not wishing you luck, because luck is not what you&#x27;ll need. I wish you will be able to grow yourself from being a victim, to having your live in your own hands. I wish you&#x27;ll be able to take action, and make decisions, and for the entire time, enjoy your process wherever it leads you.<p>One last word, you will be free of injuries or problems if you <i>find</i> yourself being free of them, it is the moment when it makes &quot;click&quot; in your brain, and that is the moment when reality changes. For me it was the moment when I discovered that I had <i>no</i> cavities, and that they <i>are</i> healing, and that my doctor was wrong. And in the same moment, my doctor <i>became</i> wrong because reality had changed. That is how it works.",1433002114

I particularly appreciate you bringing the NSX security framework to my attention. However, most of what you&#x27;re mentioning are <i>features</i> that firewalls support where my post said they needed features + <i>assurance</i> (aka &quot;guards,&quot; or firewalls with security inside). Most of the firewalls, if evaluated at all, stay at EAL4 or lower: certified to stop &quot;casual or inadvertant attempts to breach security.&quot; They don&#x27;t even get pen-tested by pro&#x27;s or a source review. Any pro taking time examining a unit will probably find a 0-day or bypass. Grime&#x27;s reviews showed many even had unknown services running, like FTP, without telling users. They&#x27;re also prone to subversion as only EAL6/7 reduces that and Snowden leaks confirmed that for many companies.<p>So, my comment and yours actually agree that network defense is necessary. I just added this in my original comment: (a) <i>real</i> endpoint security, (b) app/protocol-layer security, (c) the right features in firewall, and (d) rigorous assurance and evaluation for each. The result of these combine did resist strong attackers in the past and present. The Boeing SNS Server, for example, hasn&#x27;t been compromised in 15 years despite multiple pen-tests by NSA and private labs. That&#x27;s high assurance and minimum of rigor that stops nation states. Commercial firewalls are largely not designed like that. So, they have the features but not assurance of implementation or self-protection. And not integrated enough with endpoints for enforcement to be split properly between the two. See below for an example of a stronger configuration:<p><a href=""http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a425566.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a425566.pdf</a><p>Back to your peer review of his list, which I appreciate given your an insider.

Perimeter to me is minor DLP, DOS prevention, and IDS mainly. No 6, 7, and 8. Alright, that&#x27;s 3 in his favor.<p>Your last point is the weakest one: companies regularly spend millions on inferior or non-solutions to problems because they don&#x27;t know better. How much IT industry spends on something tells us <i>nothing</i> about its security or quality. If you&#x27;re right, then Windows, Oracle, SAP, and Cisco switches are the highest quality and most secure things out there. (Checks the CVE&#x27;s and news reports.) Nevermind...",1433001954

People actually believe this. My authority is better than yours so you uncritically accepting your authority is wrong, me uncritically accepting mine is not only right but obviously so.<p>Ignoring the absurdity of the statement, and the mind-numbing appeal to authority - this also shows a lack of knowledge of history. When people used Aristotle as an authority 500 years ago, they did it using this same rationale: Aristotle had already done all the thinking, who are you to claim to know better?<p>This is just painful.",1433001820

Do I think humans without the aid of technology can say either way to the degree that science is unreliable? Maybe for tiny slivers like meta analysis papers on relatively minute subjects within science, but as a whole? I think not.",1433001802

(In fact, spf is great, I don&#x27;t get the blame of sending spam anymore since I&#x27;ve set it.)<p>There&#x27;s an odd email server here and there that suspects anything that isn&#x27;t gmail, there was even a mail server once that required me to prove I exist, but those are very few, and normally single user installations.<p>The secret is that besides not sending spam, you must receive email. If you don&#x27;t get enough email, other servers start suspecting you. And, of course, there are configuration problems - since I&#x27;m writing my own mail server, I get a few of them, but even on standard software you have to make sure you set it correctly.",1433001742

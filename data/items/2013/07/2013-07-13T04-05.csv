6036732,comment,6031360,6032767,1,0,lambda,,,"I tried OsmAnd. I needed to download a bunch of map data when I first installed it; but once it had downloaded some of the maps, I still couldn&#x27;t view anything, it kept telling me that it was still downloading maps (I don&#x27;t know why it couldn&#x27;t display the ones it had already downloaded).<p>Once it had downloaded all of the maps and would show me something, I tried to get it to give me directions. I could not (and still cannot) figure out how to set a destination. I scroll to a place I want to go, touch the menu button, touch &quot;show&quot; or &quot;follow&quot;, and get a message &quot;please select a destination first&quot;. I long press on where I want to go, which pops up a bubble that shows my latitude and longitude (not, say, what businesses are there like Google Maps does), and try doing directions from the menu again. Nope, &quot;please select a destination&quot;.<p>There is no search by address, or anything else. If I use Google Maps, I can usually type in the name of the place I&#x27;m trying to go, and it will find the address and from there find the route. Even being able to find the route from OsmAnd has eluded me.<p>Ah. Just now, as I tried it again, I found that I could long-press on a location, then touch the menu, touch &quot;use location&quot; (at the very bottom of the menu, almost off the screen, and which apparently means &quot;use the location that I just long-pressed&quot;, not &quot;use the location I&#x27;m at&quot;), touch &quot;destination&quot;, choose to either navigate or show the route, and then get told that it can&#x27;t determine the route because the location is not available as I&#x27;m indoors without good GPS signal.<p>It needs some substantial work before it&#x27;s actually usable. For instance, it needs a prominent search that will take the name of a business or an address and route me there with a minimal number of touches and decisions, and even if I&#x27;m indoors and don&#x27;t have a good GPS signal.<p>I use mostly free software on the desktop, for my work. When I have time to sit down and debug something and figure out how it works, I&#x27;m willing to put up with a less than ideal interface; it&#x27;s worth it that I have access to the source, that I can fix bugs when I find them, that I can get in touch with the original authors and pay them to fix a bug for me.<p>But when I&#x27;m trying to navigate to some new location on my phone on my vacation, I need something that just works. I don&#x27;t have time to fiddle around with a lousy interface. I don&#x27;t have time to look up the address of my destination elsewhere, then scroll around the map until I can find that address and go through a long press and several layers of menus before I can get directions to it.<p>What we really need is freedom preserving software that just works. It doesn&#x27;t need to have every possible option and knob. It doesn&#x27;t need to offer every feature under the sun. It just needs to make it easy for me to find where I&#x27;m going and tell me how to get there, without going through endless layers of menus and making me figure out where the destination is in the first place.",1373691239

The concept of &#x27;write once, run anywhere&#x27; is fine and dandy in concept.  Until you realize that it&#x27;s a huge install base AND that there are 40 or so &#x27;subversions&#x27;(updates) to each version.  If I had a dime for every time i&#x27;ve seen a dozen java installs on a box, I&#x27;d be a rich man.  
It is truly the worst of both worlds.  Python does the &#x27;write once run anywhere&#x27; better.  C/C++/Go/etc do compiled, binary work.  Java is a bloated, half compiled mess.  
It&#x27;s funny that you defend it so, using the &#x27;age&#x27; argument.  You do know that python is years older than both Java and C#?  It&#x27;s popular because it&#x27;s done right, and has a good, open community, not because it&#x27;s &quot;new and trendy.&quot;",1373690911

6036688,comment,6033135,6036620,3,0,lsc,,,"Edit:  Yes, I know this sounds kind of... angry and juvenile.  Bitter. That is what I meant when I said that I clearly don&#x27;t have the correct solution.<p>a big part of the problem is that I don&#x27;t even know what most of these words I&#x27;m using <i>mean</i> -   And honestly?  I think it&#x27;s &quot;confidence[1]&quot;  that other people say they do.  Of course, I know I&#x27;m not competent enough in that area to know that for sure.<p>>I&#x27;ve recently found myself in a leadership role as well, and I don&#x27;t think it has to do with whether people are business types or not. Humility is necessary to fit in with peers and to get along with superiors. Confidence is necessary to influence people (be they peers, superiors, or subordinates), and you can&#x27;t manage without influence.<p>But when you are dealing with less-experienced Engineers, your accomplishments are that influence.   And when you are dealing with more-experienced Engineers, well, you should be giving them requirements, and listening to them tell you what should be done.  I mean, yeah, sometimes emotional bullshit intervenes, but it&#x27;s bullshit I can mostly deal with.<p>As an example, I came in conflict with my apprentice a while back... I am fairly certain the conflict was caused by the fact that he had learned enough that he was, well, better than me for some of the parts of his job, and that wasn&#x27;t the deal when he hired on.  (I mean, it also wasn&#x27;t true when he hired on;  he worked here for a while, and he learned a lot.)  I don&#x27;t know how much of it was him not adjusting to our new roles and how much of it was me not adjusting to our new roles (and how much of it was me just not being able to pay him what he was worth;  he ended up getting a much better job elsewhere.)<p>I mean, I didn&#x27;t understand how to /fix/ the emotional bullshit, but I had a pretty good idea of what it was about.  that&#x27;s the thing about dealing with people who are primarily engineers;  I&#x27;m not saying that I am good at managing Engineers?  but when I screw it up, I usually have a pretty good idea of how or why I did so.<p>The problem is that when you deal with normal folks, they are influenced by what looks to me like empty arrogance.   It&#x27;s like they have no way of judging actual skill, so they say &quot;Why don&#x27;t we do what the tall guy says?&quot;   you know, they focus on things like posture and voice and how you dress... which really have nothing to do with anything that matters.<p>My other problem is that I&#x27;ve always been way better at managing down than managing /up/   - that&#x27;s the primary reason I started my own company.  If you always focus on what <i>you</i> think is best for the company and/or the customer?  you are going to come into serious conflict with the management above you. [2]<p>>A piece of advice I&#x27;ve seen in a couple places is to focus on service, whether that&#x27;s service to your organization or to the team you manage, or the customer. The idea is that it takes your focus off you and your communication skills, and lets you argue from what the company or team needs.<p>Yeah, well, it&#x27;s my company, so I think I do keep my &#x27;eyes on the prize&#x27; as it were.  But that doesn&#x27;t really help when it comes time to negotiate that big new bandwidth contract (or get them to interpret that contract in my favor, after it&#x27;s signed.)<p>I mean, that&#x27;s the thing.  when you are negotiating with professionals, it&#x27;s their job to take as much of the surplus value out of a deal as possible. It is, by definition, &#x27;surplus value&#x27;  - the difference between the highest price I&#x27;m willing to pay and the lowest price they are willing to give me.<p>(the other thing about negotiating with professionals that is not fun is that they usually don&#x27;t have the attention span or  the knowledge of their product offerings to negotiate other than in the emotional manipulation way.   I&#x27;m very flexible, and very willing to line up what I buy to what they have surplus.  I&#x27;m also very willing to share what I would like, and what I can be flexible on.    A professional?  generally speaking, wants to collapse that down to a linear type deal, where we pick a product and hammer eachother on price until someone is exhausted.   Their secrecy destroys any possible gain in value from negotiation.)<p>Of course, now I&#x27;m conflating negotiation with influence in general, while I probably ought to think of those things separately.<p>[1]Confidence as in &quot;a confidence game&quot; -  I don&#x27;t think anyone understands human interaction the way you can understand, say, how a program works.    The meaning of a word someone used early in a conversation changes towards the end of that conversation.   This is where I&#x27;m lost with verbal communication.  The line between &quot;saying nice things to give someone a good feeling&quot;  and &quot;outright lying&quot; is... I don&#x27;t even see it.  I have no idea where that line is or if it even exists.  Does a professional think it&#x27;s even possible to lie in a medium that isn&#x27;t recorded?<p>[2]some of the things my apprentice and I disagreed about would have fallen under this.   The really funny thing, for me?  was that I remember having nearly exactly the same fight with my boss when I was his age, and was working in a similar role.   Things... look different when you have to balance the business end.  But, fundamentally, I think I <i>can</i> learn to deal with those conflicts, because I understood where the guy was coming from.",1373690386

There will always be scarcity of <i>something</i>. For instance, there&#x27;s scarcity of specific people. If I didn&#x27;t have finite resources, I&#x27;d love to pay Billy Joel to play a concert in a tiny bar for my friend&#x27;s birthday party. But so would everybody else, so his price to do that is bid up to a level that some people can afford to hire him for a small gig, but most can&#x27;t. Ditto for everybody else on the planet with specific unique skills. Front-row center seats for any form of live entertainment is a scarce resource - not everyone can have them at once.<p>Many other sorts of experiences will always be scarce. Like: I went to East Africa for a photo safari and got to see the rare black mountain gorillas of Rwanda in their native habitat - out in the forest rather than a cage in the zoo. If <i>everybody</i> did that the experience of hiking through virgin forest would be ruined - not to mention that there aren&#x27;t enough gorillas to go around. So you have to pay for a tracking permit. How would that sort of scarcity go away?<p>> No more commercials, since that&#x27;s pointless.<p>Much of the point of commercials is informational - they tell you or remind you that some product exists and what its characteristics are. It&#x27;s true that it&#x27;d have to be something that&#x27;s scarce, that you can&#x27;t just print yourself at home. Such as: jungle safaris or Billy Joel tickets.<p>If the cost of energy and automation comes way down it is very very unlikely that people would just stop using money. It <i>is</i> likely you wouldn&#x27;t <i>need</i> money for a lot of standard stuff. As society becomes richer, the set of things that aren&#x27;t worth charging for increases. Free water and napkins and air conditioning and light and access to a toilet and wireless internet access are becoming pretty standard now in the first world, whereas in the third world all those things might be expensive or unavailable. Today you can get free food in the form of &quot;free samples&quot; at stores that hope you&#x27;ll buy something. In the future, more basic food and shelter will become free, but the high-end stuff will always cost. However many buildings there are, not everyone can get the top-floor penthouse suite with a river view. Scarcity exists; it&#x27;s an unavoidable fact of life.",1373689146

At companies smaller than that, I&#x27;ve usually been the one to have a first look at resumes for my team.",1373688893

Using some 3rd party ORM to talk to your database is generally a no brainer, but v0.1 might not even have a database yet because persistence is not generally needed for a demo. Why put off such a core feature, because just changing your objects is less friction so and the goal is to see if anyone is ineested. aka idea validation and nothing else.",1373688546

PCA can be seen as an &quot;information bottleneck&quot; where you try to represent an N dimensional space as a K < N dimensional space such that your ability to reconstruct the original space is maximized (that is, the &quot;reconstruction error&quot; is minimized.)<p>Autoencoders are precisely the same idea, except that you use nonlinear transformations (e.g. softmax or tanh) in addition to linear transformations (matrix multiplications). You can also use multiple layers in an autoencoder, just like any neural net. (The linearness of PCA makes multiple layers useless. You can always replace multiple layers with a single layer.)",1373688494

It becomes an exercise in showing up to lab, sitting there, doing the the things the TA says, putting the exact tables they specify in your report, and being oblivious to what the lab was supposed to be accomplishing. Or at least that&#x27;s what I witnessed.<p>What you say is somewhat true for classes with regular textbooks or a prof to go back to, but when it&#x27;s a lab where all content comes from the TA running the lab, often times you end up going through wrote procedure that&#x27;s potentially even completely disconnected from the intended lab material because it&#x27;s been intercepted by three layers of translation and language confusion.",1373688009

Vendor kernels are used by hundres of thousands of servers, each sharing the same bug reports and security updates. There's a massive benefit unless you think you can do those bug reports and security updates better than your OS vendor.<p>Most custom compiles are by people who don't understand loadable modules or read somethign written before they existed.",1256727296

I've been interested in using neo4j for a while, but I was concerned about dual licensing and the costs.  I'm bootstrapping, and my budget is pretty limited.  So, I emailed neo and asked for a quote.<p>To make a long story short, Peter Neubauer from Neo called me, and we had a really great conversation for about 20-30 minutes.  He took the time to forward some papers to me about using graphs in recommendations engines.<p>Their subscription prices were crazy reasonable.  I was expecting Oracle pricing.  I was actually suprised their prices were so low.  Up to a million primitives are free. Up to 10million primitives is $49 a month.<p>I'm really glad to hear they got funding.  So far, I've been really impressed by them.  I'm looking forward to checking out their database.",1256726709

Use of laptops and presentations are just different mediums, the philosphy behind imparting knowledge needs to be looked at.

They were, not to put too fine a point on it, thrashing around without oversight. (Ranelagh's book, cited in the Wikipedia references, is well worth reading for more on the subject.)<p>* They had a real, perceived need to listen in on diplomats' conversations in noisy environments (Washington cocktail parties). Cats have very sensitive directional hearing and are less likely to attract suspicion than parabolic microphones. And the fifties and sixties were the heyday of interest in operant conditioning and brainwashing in humans -- and the use of techniques like Skinner boxes for training animals in quite complex behaviour patterns.<p>In other words: we may point and laugh today, but at the time (a) the Company was so far adrift from reality that this wasn't particularly weird by CIA standards, and (b) it's a classic case of ""we need to accomplish (a)"", ""(b) is a possible way of accomplishing (a)"", ""okay, let's throw all our resources at (b) (however outlandish and weird it might sound to a sane by-stander)"".",1256725879

907527,comment,907437,907437,0,0,Locke1689,,,"<i>Stephenson says the number of computer science courses taught at the high school level has dropped for the past six years, especially at advanced levels. In 2005, 40% of U.S. high schools offered Advanced Placement courses in computer science; that number sank to 32% in 2007 and to 27% in 2009. ""It's clear that the number of students taking computer science is dropping,"" she says.<p>Heads of other professional organizations also criticized the study for its lack of specificity among industries. The argument is that some STEM students and graduates may be worth cultivating more than others. The report's authors said it would have been too difficult and costly to perform a longitudinal data analysis by individual industry.</i><p>There's your problem.

907521,comment,905867,905867,0,0,cwb,,,"The strict answer to your question has to do with humans being social, motivation, and strong AI, I think.<p>However, if we allow teachers to stay in the picture, software could (and should I think) be used more to support learning. It could improve students' abilities significantly if done sensibly.<p>Data-mining would probably be useful to tune such a program, but I wouldn't expect it to outcompete teachers on the structuring of materials and answering students' questions any time soon.<p>The question on how to grade students is fascinating. There's an argument for one long exam at the end of your studies: you get the grade corresponding to your performance at the end of your studies. If you ""get it"" late in the course you're not penalised for earlier performance and, more importantly, it encourages you to take a long-term perspective on what you learn. I've experienced both teacher + frequent non-standard test assessment in school and one shot at two weeks of exams after 3 years at university. The former is problematic because grades become uncalibrated (thus losing much of their intended usefulness). My main concern with the latter is that you can end up testing things you don't intend.<p>Calculating the grade from appropriate data captured over a long time would be great -- comparisons and profiles could be both more detailed and more stable than what a teacher could provide. (There are some things it couldn't test, like handling the pressure of final exams.)<p>Do you think computers should have replaced teachers? Why do you think that hasn't happend?",1256725199

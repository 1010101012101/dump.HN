The most you could perhaps hope for is to donate some plugin to Mozilla and hope they'll bundle it with future versions of their browser. I think they always ship an SVG plugin (not sure if that would allow for hardware accelerated graphics), but does Internet Explorer support SVG?\n",1177930603

So I am surprised that GMail integration killed Kiko. Isn't there an email service out there where you could plug in things? That used to be the trend among web applications, to provide a Web Service/API so that it could be extended?",1177930260

18078,comment,18076,18076,0,0,bizcurious,,,"I've been involved with a few startups that crashed and burned - I haven't made any money beyond my salary or hourly rate. I'm acquainted with a lot of Valley guys who are more loaded than me ($200-$500K per year) simply because they are buddied up with VCs and know how to work financial deals in their own favor. <p>These guys have MBAs. My question is, will getting an MBA help me out? I'm worried at the moment... it seems as an engineer, that my options are to sell my company for $12M or more, or else wallow around at a max of about $90K per year for the rest of my working life. <p>Since the average 2 bedroom condo goes for $800K out here, I'd like to hedge so that if my startup doesn't work out, I'd at least be able to draw a $200K salary somewhere. Is an MBA going to help me out in this regard?",1177927229

Sometimes these things are pillars clearly visible at eye level.<p>I personally hate the idea of drivers wearing these things. My undergraduate was in psychology, neurophysiology, and hence I&#x27;ve been formally trained in attention and perception - I&#x27;ve got a better idea than layfolk on how these are compromised, though I&#x27;m not a professional in the field. In my opinion, the Glass is a significant attentional split - which is bad for driving. One example: say voice control is working fine (it doesn&#x27;t always). You still have to take your eyes off the road, target a small reticle, make sure the glass is responding correctly. Even after that, there&#x27;s still issues like just having a phone call in the car, which regardless of the device is a driving-performance-reducing attentional split.<p>Glass really, really impresses me as a technological feat; as a product I think it&#x27;s a solution looking for a problem; and as a social phenomenon, I think it&#x27;s quite dangerous when mixed with common activities like driving.",1389938212

Maybe I make another person richer than myself through my hard work, but I did it building an Earbits, not flipping burgers.  To compare the situation of a funded founder to that of a &quot;laborer&quot; is so misguided.  The latter not only never see a big outcome, but have no chance at it either.

However, with each passing day and the Yahoo home page continues to feature irritating ads with zooming cars and flying coke cans, my hopes are starting to fade.<p>Putting marketing in charge of journalism is probably a bad move but worse is the poaching of mainstream, old-school talent from the NYT or NBC. If we have learned nothing from the internet it is that interesting, intelligent commentary and opinion does not necessarily originate with the NYT. The trick is to find the untapped talent out there, the writers with a fresh view and who are not committed to the old ways and give them a voice, assuming you want to make Yahoo into a media giant on par with the NYT. But it starts with new voices not repackaged old voices who had a lock on the channels of communication for decades for historical and accidental reasons not merit.",1389936624

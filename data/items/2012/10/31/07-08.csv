4721686,comment,4721550,4721550,22,0,tikhonj,,,"I don't think the library situation is nearly as bad as some people--not necessarily the author of this presentation--make out.<p>For one, Haskell actually has a pretty good and growing collection of libraries, probably disproportionate to the language's popularity. Web development, in particular, is well represented: there are several competing web frameworks; Yesod even has commercial backing now. Haskell even has some libraries that are not well reproduced in other languages like QuickCheck and Parsec. I've also been looking at sbv lately, which seems rather more convenient than other languages' alternatives.<p>Additionally, libraries aren't the only thing that matters. In fact, most libraries are pretty trivial. I remember seeing a presentation by Brian O'Sullivan online about his experiences with using Haskell at a startup. One point that really stood out to me was about libraries: sure, some libraries (like JSON parsing, I believe) were missing; however, it only took him something like a couple of days to write it from scratch. Those days are easily overshadowed by Haskell's core advantages. I would much rather spend a couple of days writing a new library than trying to track down a bug Haskell's type system would have caught. The beauty of this system is also that each library only needs to be written once and can then be reused, making the world better for everyone.<p>Now, there are some other issues with Haskell. Cabal really is a big one. I just spent quite a while fighting cabal, and I'm not even sure how I won in the end :P. Happily, I believe people are working on addressing the cabal issue.<p>I'm sure there are other annoyances besides. But no language is entirely free of annoyances. Considering everything, I really do think Haskell is a good choice for a very wide range of programming problems, especially in a startup setting.",1351670368

Very strong typing and great abstraction does make development easier. E.g., I have been writing parsers lately for an application-specific macro language. Writing such parsers using a good Haskell parser combinator library such as parsec is many times more productive than parser generators for most imperative languages.<p>Another advantage is that strong languages allow you to refactor code easily. If you change some types, the compiler will find type mismatches, allowing you to fix code rapidly. I can imagine that startups often refactor and substantially modify their codebase.<p>In the end you do not only want to develop an application quickly, but also correctly. If a strong language can be used to eliminate most errors and improve productivity, I see it as an asset to a startup.",1351670023

Ask ""out of box"" questions to get ""out of box"" answers. Einstein made many scientific discoveries by asking himself what would happen if he traveled at the speed of light.<p>3.

For any sort of performance beyond a standard Xeon, you're going to want to run a Xeon Phi as a targeted accelerator rather than offloading entire processes to it and using a standard MPI stack.

For example, it just has to fire off a ""schedule an event"" intent, and Android will route that to your preferred schedule management app. There is no security hole here - it's simple event firing and consumption, except it happens across apps. Security is handled by allowing the user to select which app they want to consume the event, and annoyance is mitigated by allowing users to specify that the selected app should always be used as the default.

You can only delete a search term by entering a new one, even with ""search history"" disabled. Really tweaks my OCD sense.<p>Great app technically though. Hopefully this'll push Apple to make Siri more responsive.",1351667064

Instead, you use a design framework like bootstrap so you can quickly bang out an interactive site that looks ok but maybe not great but is still highly functional.<p>It's a way to build a website in a short amount of time without being held-back by the frankly horrendous design and layout choices that come when you use simplistic html.<p>P.S. No, you are not expressing ""confusion"", you are using ""confusion"" as cover for derision.",1351666816

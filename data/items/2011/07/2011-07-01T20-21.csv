2720136,comment,2717697,2718843,1,0,fexl,,,"Right, I don't enforce purity, but I do allow it.  Ultimately there's a ""string_put"" function which (1) produces an actual side effect and (2) evaluates to the identity function.  You can wrap monadic (monastic?) purity around that if you like.<p>Also, strict typing is pretty much impossible in Fexl, since I'm using combinators.  You can't really assign a meaningful type to things like S, C, I, Y, etc.  So yes, Fexl is very ""loosey-goosey"" that way.  I also didn't want to bother with some ponderous PhD project like a ""type inference engine"" written into my ANSI-C interpreter.  I figure if you want to do high level things like that, write those tools in Fexl itself (i.e. use meta-programming techniques).",1309553953

If you'd like to each, map, filter, find, reject, every, some, invoke, include, sortBy, without, or pluck over your models, try Backbone.<p>If Backbone looks too bewildering at first glance, Spine may be easier to start with: the documentation is certainly better geared for beginners.",1309553897

The regex search with active highlighting in both the minimap and the file is also nice, and multi-select is pretty helpful for refactoring repetitive code.<p>That said, ST is just a text editor, not an IDE - while some features, like autocomplete, are partially compensated for, it doesn't do type checking or follow references across files, so other features that stem from those will be missed; e.g. refactoring across multiple files is usually faster in Eclipse.

Suitable frameworks exist in open-source format, which can be built upon (up to you).<p>If you are a self-motivated developer who likes the idea of disrupting a large market then please get in contact for more information! Experience and track record of bringing a customer focused product to market and start-up experience is a huge bonus.<p>----------------------------------------------------<p>With my science background (PhD), I'm somewhat technical but I won't be an idiot and list the different technologies I think you will need. This is of course up to you and you alone will decide on the stack and direction that it takes.<p>As your partner I will be charge of product design, business development, sales and marketing. I am driven by my vision, I work extremely hard and I will do whatever it takes to take us to the next level. I also see our partnership as a great opportunity to learn more programming and to eventually contribute some code myself.<p>I can offer co-founder equity as well as a negotiable salary (based on us getting into the incubator). I am not expecting you to rush into this partnership head-on. If you are also doing some freelance work on the side (etc.), I am flexible enough to work around that until we have pocketed the incubator funding.<p>If you are a cool dude and you want to know more then contact me at dapgutmann@gmail.com",1309552754

If youre not in Seattle but are up for a change of scenery, Amazon has a great relocation program that makes it extremely easy to join AWS.<p>To apply, send your resume to aws-jobs-fast-yc@amazon.com.<p>AWS is an unique mix of startup culture/autonomy combined with the ability to leverage the incredible infrastructure of Amazon/AWS. Ive worked in AWS for the past year and Ive learned more in that time than I thought possible.

In AWS, they are one and the same. I like having scalability, availability, and performance as core features of the product Im building. Another thing I love about working in AWS is the impact your work has - your service is used by thousands of developers, and those developers use your service in ways you never imagined, which are then used by millions of people.<p>Detailed job descriptions :<p><a href=""https://us-amazon.icims.com/jobs/133388/job"" rel=""nofollow"">https://us-amazon.icims.com/jobs/133388/job</a><p><a href=""https://us-amazon.icims.com/jobs/137679/job"" rel=""nofollow"">https://us-amazon.icims.com/jobs/137679/job</a><p><a href=""https://us-amazon.icims.com/jobs/137677/job"" rel=""nofollow"">https://us-amazon.icims.com/jobs/137677/job</a>",1309551697

However, this method is still vulnerable if a hacker gains access to the seeds on the host computer. This is what happened to RSA recently and it's a very bad thing when it happens.<p>What I was talking about was something different. Public/private key encryption where only the public key is stored on the server.<p>Here's an example scenario: the server generates a random pass-phrase then encrypts it using the public key. The end-user then uses their smartphone where the private key is stored to decrypt the message and return the original pass-phrase back to the server, proving they have the private key. There are similar ways of achieving a similar result that are less cumbersome and awkward. The advantage is that if the public key is leaked it's not a big deal, it can't be used to gain access to the system.",1309550610

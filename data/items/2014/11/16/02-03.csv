In actuality commercial applicators, most likely employees of commercial fertilizer companies or Coops are applying a very large amount of total pesticides.<p>I spent twenty years in the fertilizer business as an agronomist.  Interestingly a government study back in the nineties found a link between commercial pesticide applicators and depression.  In that study it was only insecticides that caused problems.  Note a large percentage of those insecticides are no longer applied as extensively because of genetically modified seeds.",1416106759

A single lexical-analyzer/parser front end can be used to generate code for several different machines by providing different back ends that translate a common intermediate language to a machine-specific assembly language. Conversely, you can write several front ends that parse several different high-level languages, but which all output the same intermediate language. This way, compilers for several languages can share a single optimizer and back end.&quot;",1416105551

I prefer expression based programming where there&#x27;s a balance between the two sides of an operator.  Declaring named values on the RHS is just horrible (again, IMHO).  The only reason for it to exist is because C# hasn&#x27;t got proper tuple support.<p>By the way, creating a new variable half-way down a method is also creating a new scope (the variable isn&#x27;t in scope above the declaration, and it is in scope below it, until the end of the method).<p>For example:<p><pre><code>    public int GetSurnameLength()\n    {\n        string fullName = ReadFullNameFromDb();\n        Tuple<string,string> result = ParseName(fullName);\n        return result.Item2.Length;\n    }  \n</code></pre>\nHas the same effect as:<p><pre><code>    public int GetSurnameLength()\n    {\n        string fullName = ReadFullNameFromDb();\n        return ParseName(fullName).Apply( (first,last) => last.Length );\n    }  \n\n</code></pre>\nThe only real downside to the Apply method is the syntax clutter from the closure.

Those chewy multivitamins and plant-based omega-3 sources don&#x27;t seem to really help anything, for instance.<p>By the way, omega-3 from fish oil has strong evidence of an effect on major depression[1], but not the everyday kind.

8613254,comment,8609775,8611157,0,0,nickbauman,,,"Ok try this: Go model a square and a rectangle in your favorite statically typed language. You will find that square extends rectangle and setting the length on a square also sets the width. So far so good? So if I have a collection of rectangles which contains an unknown number of squares of which I set the width on each of them. You can&#x27;t answer the question as to whether the result is correct or not. And I have just destroyed your type system&#x27;s purpose by using polymoronism, expectoration and dispossession, the three-legged stool of static typing OO, with a very simple and well-defined domain subset of geometry.<p>Of course it&#x27;s contrived but since I&#x27;ve been programming (which is longer than I care to say here, because it really dates me) this is basically where I&#x27;m at with static type systems. AS long as I&#x27;ve spent with them I find they&#x27;re not as useful as they should be. I haven&#x27;t tried Haskell (I probably should) but I&#x27;m getting too much done with dynamic languages, especially Lisps, to look back right now. Too much power to look away. Tschau!",1416103323

I found the instruction there excellent--at least for theory classes like Automata, Decision And Complexity Theory as well as Data Structures.  They offer a real distance education that is run just like an in-person class, with videotaped lectures, projects, and proctored exams. They are one the few universities that offer the full repertoire of bachelor CS classes online, a little known secret. Even though their distance education isn&#x27;t well marketed, you could complete in theory a BS computer science remotely just through NC State--something that you can&#x27;t quite yet do with MITx or Udacity--and in addition, their online CS classes do not have an asterisk on your transcript indicating they were taken online, since you are often lumped into a section with the in-person class.",1426201193

9194560,comment,9193521,9193521,0,0,byuu,,,"The idea that nVidia and AMD are detecting your games, and then replacing shaders, optimizing around bugs, etc should be absolutely terrifying. And vice versa, the idea of having to fix every major game&#x27;s incredibly broken code is equally terrifying. And it&#x27;s a huge hit to all of us indie devs, who don&#x27;t get the five-star treatment to maximize performance of our games. So overall, I&#x27;d say this is a step in the right direction.<p>However! Having written OpenGL 3 code before, the idea that Vulkan is going to be a lot <i>more</i> complex, frankly scares the hell out of me. I&#x27;m by no means someone that programs massive 3D engines for major companies. I just wanted to be able to take a bitmap, optionally apply a user-defined shader to the image, stretch it to the size of the screen, and display it. (and even without the shaders, even in 2015, filling a 1600p monitor with software scaling is a <i>very</i> painful operation. Filling a 4K monitor in software is likely not even possible at 60fps, even without any game logic added in.)<p>That took me several weeks to develop just the core OpenGL code. Another few days for each platform interface (WGL/Windows, CGL/OSX, GLX/Xorg). Another few days for each video card&#x27;s odd quirks. In total, my simple task ended up taking me 44KB of code to write. You may think that&#x27;s nothing, but tiny code is kind of my forte. My ZIP decompressor is 8KB, PNG decompressor is another 8KB (shares the inflate algorithm), and my HTTP/1.1 web server+client+proxy with a bunch of added features (run as service, pass messages from command-line via shared memory, APIs to manipulate requests, etc) is 24KB of code.<p>Now you may say, &quot;use a library!&quot;, but there really isn&#x27;t a library that tries to do just 2D with some filtering+scaling. SDL (1.2 at least) just covers the GL context setup and window creation: you issue your own GL commands to it. And anything more powerful ends up being entire 3D engines like Unity that are like using a jack hammer to nail in drywall.<p>And, uh ... that&#x27;s kind of the point of what I&#x27;m doing. I&#x27;m someone trying to <i>make</i> said library. But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to handle the complexity of all these new APIs. And I&#x27;m also not a big player, so few people will use my library anyway.<p>So the point of this wall of text ... I really, really hope they&#x27;ll consider the use case of people who just want to do simple 2D operations and have something official like Vulkan2D that we can build off of.<p>Also, I haven&#x27;t seen Vulkan yet, but I really hope the Vsync situation is better than OpenGL&#x27;s &quot;set an attribute, call an extension function, and cross your fingers that it works.&quot; It would be really nice to be able to poll the current rendering status of the video card, and drive all the fun new adaptive sync displays, in a portable manner.",1426201170

I think we&#x27;ve seen this kind of interaction play out on a much smaller scale in the commercial world, and we&#x27;re seeing more of it. For example, when Intermountain Healthcare selected a Cerner EHR, they did so as part of a multi-year partnership [1], under the condition that Cerner would provide open interfaces to their EHR data so that Intermountain could continue developing (and begin porting their existing) home-grown decision support tools. Part of the arrangement was an innovation fund to support development of the specifications needed. And I think that&#x27;s actually a great pattern, since we certainly won&#x27;t have all the answers right out of the gate. With respect to DHMSM, the timeline is long enough that it&#x27;s very hard to name relevant technologies on the way in, without the concern that they&#x27;ll be out of date (or at least out of fashion) by the time implementation hits.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.cerner.com/Intermountain_and_Cerner_announce_strategic_partnership/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cerner.com/Intermountain_and_Cerner_announce_stra...</a>",1426201162

A targeted abstraction that correctly supports the domain you are in is still a good thing.

You can even play around with Epic&#x27;s implementation on FHIR here: <a href=""http://open.epic.com/Interface/FHIR"" rel=""nofollow"">http://open.epic.com/Interface/FHIR</a>. I&#x27;ll admit. I was shocked when I found out it connected to a real Interconnect engine.<p>This makes a lot of sense. IHE profiles and CCDAs are suboptimal ways in 2015 to transfer data between HIEs and Epic/Cerner/Allscripts along with every other EHR vendor either sell them or need to connect with them. It would behoove them to embrace this support in the same way it behooved hospitals to embrace HL7v2 in 1990: it saves them alot of work and money.<p>Of course, this doesn&#x27;t help the average patient or app developer. How users will interact with these APIs and whether or not hospitals will have a standard and easy way to open them up is still yet to be seen. I imagine there will still be some work involved there, but I&#x27;m optimistic for the future.",1426200617

Abolitionists within the company actually got promos printed that violated it, so the issue eventually came to a head. There was a dramatic meeting and things abruptly reversed course: no more promos, no pushing the line at all. Players are likely stuck with the reserved list for the rest of the game&#x27;s existence.<p>The reserved list really does hurt great formats like Legacy that include cards covered by the reserved list. The market has gone absolutely crazy for those cards. Many Legacy-playable cards will set you back hundreds of dollars each, and a deck can hit $10,000+. This really limits the number of people that can play the format.<p>Deciding to keep the reserved list also directly led to the creation of the Modern format, which tries to be Legacy but only with cards Wizards can reprint. Modern has not quite flopped, but is not all that popular considering the amount of resources Wizards has poured into it - and this is attributable to a lack of diversity of decks caused by the more restricted pool of cards.<p>The reserved list kept the game going at the time, but in the end is probably one of the worst mistakes the company ever made.",1426200407

The CPU has to sync with the GPU to know when the resources associated with draw commands are safe to release.  Having something like glTexImage2D is way too high level for these graphics APIs and would be a luxury.  Instead we get a plain memory buffer and convert manually to the internal pixel format.<p>There is no waiting to free resources however, unless either the CPU or GPU is starving for work.  We have a triple-buffering setup and on consoles you also get to create your own front/back/middle surfaces as well as implement your own buffer swap routine.  This provides a sync point where we can mark the resources as safe to release.<p>It&#x27;s definitely more complexity on the engine part, but as mentioned in the forum post it makes everything much, much easier when you get to debug and tune things.  Also having to implement (or maintain) all of that engine infrastructure gives us a better perspective into how the hardware works and how to optimize for it.<p>However, even with Vulkan or DirectX12 I doubt NVidia or AMD will expose their hardware internals publicly which is critical in optimizing shader code.  On consoles we get profilers able to show metrics from all of the GPU&#x27;s internal pipeline.

But you probably know more about this than me.<p>> making hidden time bombs for older browsers to find blowing up in their faces at later dates: Not Good.<p>Doesn&#x27;t that happen all the time? What I mean is: If ES6 becomes widely supported in browsers, pages written on it will make old browsers &quot;blow up&quot;, too. Unless the people who program those make two versions, which defeats the point of using ES6 in the first place. The same when a new version of CSS comes out - use that, and the old browsers &quot;blow up&quot;, too.<p>It seems to me it is the nature of the beast - new features make old browsers blow up.",1426199136

9194314,comment,9192308,9192308,0,0,lookingup,,,"He did graduate, though. That little sheepskin may seem only like a small thing, but the difference between having it and not having it should not be underestimated. He also had parental support, which, until you live without it - in the US, it&#x27;s many people&#x27;s &quot;safety net of first resort&quot; - you just cannot imagine the benefits it gives you. You can fail in all sorts of ways and still come back - you have a place to lay your head when it comes down to it, and that counts for a lot. The difference between that and thinking &quot;hm, homelessness actually possible!&quot; is so stark it&#x27;s hard to overstate. The poster &quot;floated by&quot; and is doing great; I can share some experiences on what it&#x27;s like on the opposite end of the spectrum.<p>I didn&#x27;t go to college because I had to leave home early (was told I had to be out at 16, was out by 17) to support myself, and received no parental support when I left. I did, however, manage to work myself from a tech support hamster at 17 to sysadmin, then junior developer, then finally senior developer. I never lacked for work, and have made OK, but not amazing money. That all sounds great, but it comes with serious costs, especially if you&#x27;re just &quot;decent&quot; or &quot;pretty good.&quot; Here are my experiences:<p>- You&#x27;re probably going to have to work 2-3x as hard as an equivalently skilled person to prove that you deserve to be there.<p>- You may have to deal with much lower raises, or deal with simply being passed up for them altogether. This one can be more subtle, so can be hard to prove. So, you may be picked for the challenging work, asked to lead teams, told you&#x27;re the best on the team by the boss(es), and receive the company awards, but when it comes to raise time, you wonder why you just went from 80 to 85k, and the people below you in rank went from 80 to 110 (and aren&#x27;t happy with that and leave anyway. Heh.) This one sucks the most, because it&#x27;s the one you have the least control over, and will ultimately impact the number of choices available to you later on.<p>- You may experience another subtle thing. This: &quot;we know you&#x27;re good, but you don&#x27;t have a degree, so we believe you&#x27;re less likely to leave because the hoops for you to change jobs is higher, so we can ask you for more than your degreed peers - and we&#x27;re probably right about it.&quot; You will be the person on-call more often (if that applies to you - sysadmin/devops), you will be &quot;expected&quot; to stay later, and just generally push harder to prove yourself.<p>- You&#x27;re going to spend a LOT of your free time teaching yourself knew things, honing your skills, and brushing up on the theory you <i>never learned in a setting that allowed you to immerse</i>. Now, maybe you have superior learning capabilities and can just sponge this stuff up in just a couple of your after-work learning sessions, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a stretch to say that for those of us who aren&#x27;t, we spend a lot of time making them stick over the years. Now, we know that everyone needs to do this stuff these days, and that it&#x27;s becoming more necessary every day. No question about it. However, you will have to do it <i>even more</i> to make sure you&#x27;re at the top of <i>your</i> game. You may have annoying gaps in your knowledge, and will have to go back (in some cases, WAY back) to fill that stuff in. (Now that there&#x27;s Khan/Udacity/MIT OCW/others, this is actually a LOT easier to do.) If you&#x27;re only decent/pretty good, you&#x27;re going to have run significantly faster to stay in place. Forget most of your social life. Again, this does not apply to you if you happen to just be an superhumanly fast learner, but for the decent/pretty good, it probably does.<p>- Culturally, your degreed peers may have some trouble adjusting to you. Of course this happens at every level (people who went to state school treated differently than those who went to a top university, for example), but you&#x27;ll be the strangest of the bunch. People may wonder if you know anything at all(!), not just about your field (which is easy enough to prove), but about the world around you: politics, economics, sociology, literature, the lot of it. Sometimes you may be looked at as a strange feral orphan child. They just may not even have a baseline for what to expect from you. The software world(s) may be more meritocratic and/or egalitarian, but it&#x27;s not utopia. Now, this sounds /all/ bad, but I actually have always liked this one; if you are a dedicated self-learner, you can blow people away pretty easily. They expect you to not be able to tie your shoes, but then you rattle off your knowledge X, Y, and Z and show them your elegant, well-structured code and they are agape. This one is fun!<p>- Remember that the degree acts as a proxy. It&#x27;s a way for organizations to outsource not only judgment about your knowledge, but your socio-economic background (in most cases), your &quot;level of socialization&quot;, your ability to &quot;follow-through&quot; (and your personal story about how you had to leave home early and support yourself alone and spend all your free time learning unfortunately will not count in many/most places. Sorry!), and how &quot;convincing&quot; you are.  You may not be listened to (even if you turn out to be right, at least for a time), your opinions may be given less weight, people may feel more comfortable cutting you off when you&#x27;re talking, etc. This one can be surmounted: if you are right enough times when others are wrong you may start be taken <i>very</i> seriously. Still, the bar is higher for you. Much higher. This one is probably obvious, but is worth stating.<p>- You may have to content yourself with smaller and/or less-respected organizations. I know, I know meritocracy, etc. If you&#x27;re amazing, you can most certainly get into Google and friends, but again, if you&#x27;re only decent/pretty good, you /probably/ won&#x27;t. For those of you who have ever wondered &quot;who works /would want to work at crappy place X?&quot;, it&#x27;s not just CS grads who couldn&#x27;t hack it at Google or the &#x27;printer guy&#x27; who got promoted to LOB programming. Sometimes it&#x27;s smart, pretty good devs who are either just short of what&#x27;s needed for the bigger players or are incredibly intimidated by the interview processes/hiring filters. It&#x27;s funny to think that these places are (based on comments I&#x27;ve read here on HN) inundated with resumes from people who are nowhere even close to qualified, but people who <i>are</i> qualified, or at least could be with some knowledge gaps filled in/&quot;senior-level&quot; mentoring don&#x27;t even apply in the first place. Doesn&#x27;t surprise me that something like Starfighters now exists to (maybe?) try to reach these people and mop them up. I would also say that you can be <i>very</i> valued at startups. You may be one of those great &quot;get things off the ground&quot; people, like many self-starters, and if you are, your metaphorical phone will ring a lot. I wouldn&#x27;t say it evens things out, but it sure helps (and feels good to be real a go-to person!)<p>- Unless you really are one of the best, expect to always be questioned. You probably will need to psych yourself up a lot, because it&#x27;s very easy to get disheartened and discouraged when you feel like you&#x27;re never quite good enough/people are always going to assume there&#x27;s &quot;a lot he/she probably just doesn&#x27;t know if we&#x27;re honest&quot; (even if you have been working for decades and proven yourself with real work)/you don&#x27;t ever quite fit in culturally because you&#x27;ve never had the &quot;college experience.&quot; You need to be tougher (psychologically) than your degreed peers, because you will have to work much harder to earn respect.<p>So this person floated, others swim upstream to get to where he is. It can be done for people without degrees, but it actually is hard. You really can&#x27;t imagine what that little piece of paper - even if you just &quot;barely&quot; earned it - can do you for you. It&#x27;s not just about getting hired.<p>&quot;I’m already starting to see some really smart high schoolers skip college to get into the workforce because they know what they want, and good for them.&quot;<p>If these &quot;smart high schoolers&quot; have the ability to have someone else pay for their education, I recommend that they go to school. If they have Zuckerberg-parent level of support or are already mindblowingly skilled/knowledgeable, OK, sure, don&#x27;t bother. They&#x27;re probably going to succeed no matter what. If they are on the margin, though - parents wealthy enough to send them to a real university, but not wealthy enough to Zuck them, tell them to go instead. Or at least work for a couple of years, then go back. If someone gave me a few hundred thousand to go to a great university, I&#x27;d still go in a heartbeat. You cannot replace the <i>quality</i> of networks you&#x27;ll get there. You cannot replace the <i>immersion.</i> You cannot replace the <i>prestige.</i> You just can&#x27;t. The magic of university is being surrounded by &quot;brilliant, ambitious, well-connected elites.&quot; I&#x27;m probably right in the sweet spot of the target of today&#x27;s alternative education: I couldn&#x27;t go to college, I&#x27;m a regular user of MOOCs, I do self-directed learning, I&#x27;m a devourer of books, I&#x27;m someone who does coding challenges, I&#x27;m fairly smart, AND I&#x27;ve managed some level of success, which proves it&#x27;s possible, and yet I would <i>still</i> tell these people to go to college.",1426198369

A lot of the data I write to any medium at home is never overwritten. But not every use is the use of an average consumer, knowing the actual limits is important.",1426197953

9194261,comment,9189177,9193636,0,0,dalke,,,"You said &quot;has been achieved in an armed conflict&quot;. That&#x27;s an exaggeration because &#x27;armed conflict&#x27; is so very broad, and includes bloodless wars. You&#x27;ve qualified it now with &quot;has been achieved in long term occupation by peacekeepers.&quot; I agree that if you narrow the definition enough, you can make it be correct.<p>(I should have included the Falklands War as a war with few innocent/non-combatant civilian deaths compared to military deaths. Argentina lost 649 people as part of their military force, the UK 255, and three Falklands civilians died, from friendly fire.)<p>There&#x27;s little need to look towards Soviet occupation for a comparison. We did long term occupations of the Dominican Republic (1916-1924) (<a href=""http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a491390.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a491390.pdf</a> is the best document I found on the occupation; most other references are to the 1965-1966 occupation) and Haiti (1915-1934), which was publicly described as a mission to &#x27;re-establish peace and order&#x27;. We also controlled the Philippines from 1902 to 1946. There was insurgent opposition in all three places. By comparison, the US response in Iraq is indeed much better than General Smith&#x27;s order to &quot;KILL EVERY ONE OVER TEN&quot; as part of the American atrocities in the Philippines.<p>In any case, when you talk about long-term peacekeeper forces, you need to include things like the UN peacekeepers on Cyprus, who have helped prevent sectarian conflict between ethnically Greek and Turkish Cypriots. And done so with very few casualties. (Go ahead and add another qualifier, in that the UNFICYP has only 1,000 people.)<p>But put all that aside. When you write &quot;this rate of collateral damage is far better than has ever been achieved in an armed conflict&quot; ... how do you know? How do you measure collateral damage? Whose numbers do you trust, and why?",1426197864

The way it is laid out now, it seems it is separate from Github Enterprise.<p>The current feature text blurb is too much text and too little text at the same time :) Too much because it is just\nlong lines of text.

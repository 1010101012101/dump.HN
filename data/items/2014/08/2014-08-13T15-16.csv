This isn&#x27;t about bricks-and-mortar retailers switching to use Amazon as a payment mechanism, it&#x27;s about providing a payment services for the (largely) local service vendors who sell their services via Amazon Local (Amazon&#x27;s daily deal platform).<p>Powering the payments system will give Amazon the data to do far more dynamic pricing (something which they have a lot of expertise in) for their vendors on Amazon Local which is a win for both the vendors and Amazon.",1407945585

I wrote the Meteor app in about half the time and it had more features. I didn&#x27;t do the experiment with Dart, but I have written enough server and client experiments in Dart that I believe that Dart is not as agile as Meteor using plain JavaScript.<p>That said, Dart is nice, and for some combined client/server projects it makes sense. I don&#x27;t understand the complaints about it being a Google project though. I used GWT a while back on personal projects and for customer work, and Google did a good job of open sourcing it so betting a company on GWT seemed safe enough. I have the same opinion about Dart - it could have a life without Google support.",1407945548

There are already various vendors that do just this on top of it. The funny thing is, if you&#x27;re a big guy too, say 10K instances, you also need to use 3rd party tools since the AWS UI can&#x27;t handle that case either. But since <i>everything is an API call</i> you can build your business by making AWS better for hire.

The NSA and CIA are used to dealing with the latter so it is their default; they want to throw the former into the same bucket and use the same tactics/propaganda against them.<p>To me it seems a dangerous game to give US intelligence any more information about what you know. At every turn they&#x27;re going to use what they know Snowden knows.

Some notable recent things from the top of my head:<p><pre><code>    * Soon: Dart on App Engine: https://www.dartlang.org/cloud/\n    * Polymer.dart (replacement for Web UI, interop w/ Polymer.js)\n    * Angular.dart (now 6 times faster! http://blog.angulardart.org/)\n    * Dart became an official ECMA Standard (http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-408.pdf)\n    * More and more incredible packages to use on pub http://pub.dartlang.org/packages?page=1\n    * Dart 1.6 soon to be released which supports installing pub packages globally (similar to npm)\n    * People start to learn about functional reactive programming and Dart as great native support for its concepts: https://www.dartlang.org/docs/tutorials/streams/\n</code></pre>\nBuilding and releasing non-trivial projects takes some time so there is always a bit of an incubation period re visibility of adoption and like I said from my own perception even though it is just a personal anecdote Dart is getting picked up.<p>Shameless plug: I&#x27;ve also started a series of posts on why I fell in love with Dart.

Server CPU and memory usage? Scaling? Do you have some actual performance benchmarks comparing the two? And does guacamole perform better when connecting to the same VNC server or is that comparing VNC server with an RDP server. RDP itself is a newer, more complex and more efficient protocol than VNC but VNC is supported pretty much everywhere. RDP could pretty easily be implemented in noVNC by somebody with the time (in fact it&#x27;s been on the aspirational feature list for years).<p>With noVNC the protocol decode/encode is done in the browser (modern browsers are plenty fast enough to do this easily), whereas with Guacamole the burden of decode/encode for every client happens on the server where the proxy/client part is running. Even if you need to run websockify to proxy/bridge noVNC, the only thing it is doing is shuttling network traffic and the python implementation of websockify can easily handle lots of simultaneous clients without breaking a sweat.<p>noVNC was designed with Infrastructure as a Server (IaaS) providers in mind so minimizing server CPU, memory and bandwidth was a goal in the design.<p>Also, guacamole does use websockets when it is available.",1407944208

It seems like there is a drive to structure interviews like programming competitions or Jeopardy.  However, the latter two are games; an interview should be a well-constructed test, not a game.

The inputs and outputs are often asynchronous, meaning that they may arrive or change values unpredictably at any point in time.<p>* It must be able to respond to interrupts, that is, high-priority events, even when it is busy doing something else.<p>* Its operation and reaction to inputs often reflects stringent time requirements.<p>* It has many possible operational scenarios, depending on the current mode of operation and the current values of its data as well as its past behavior.<p>* It is very often based on interacting processes that operate in parallel.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/papers/jnfoster-dissertation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/papers/jnfoster-disserta...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/lenses-etapsslides.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/lenses-etapsslides...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~harel/reactive_systems.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~harel/reactive_systems.htm...</a>",1407943374

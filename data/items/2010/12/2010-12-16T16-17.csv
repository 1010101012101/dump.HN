2012660,comment,2009441,2010944,0,0,grandalf,,,"True, he does have the right to be angry, but unless he's an uncommonly egotistical person I find it hard to believe that he'd react quite that strongly to an allegation that was completely false, unless he was deliberately trying to leverage his perceived reputation and personal pride to allay suspicion.<p>Consider an FBI informant who has penetrated a terrorist cell.  Suppose one of the actual terrorists suspects him and accuses him of being a traitor in front of the rest.  What will he do to save his skin?  He'll be indignant, he'll try to tug on any personal ties he has with the other members, he'll cite his reputation, he'll potentially attack the accuser.<p>Why?  Because he feels that in order to be perceived as telling the truth he has to ""leak"" raw human emotion.  He has to communicate that his rational mind is not in control b/c he feels that others will doubt him if they don't see that human emotion.<p>If he's innocent on the other hand, he'd laugh and say f<i></i>* you and assume nobody would take it all that seriously, since he would not assume that anybody would listen to such a ludicrous allegation, and if he started to actually worry that the accusation was believable to others, he'd think quite rationally and demand that his accuser produce more evidence, since he has the information advantage about his own actions and could easily refute false charges.",1292518739

2012658,comment,2011996,2012567,0,0,jerf,,,"True with rational actors. Massive nation states in the 20th century tended towards a certain degree of rationality by their ponderous nature. Cold war dogma will have to be updated in an era when you can not count on rationality from the actors possessing nuclear weapons, where small sets of individuals or potentially even individuals can control when and where they detonate.<p>Emphasizing the <i>un</i>survivability of a nuclear war <i>encourages</i> terrorists and marginal, rogue nation states and feeds into their ideation of ""Once I have a nuke, they'll have to take me seriously!"", a dynamic we can already see in the world. If you want to consider the effects of propaganda on world behavior (severed from the question of the truth of the propaganda), a good case can be made that now is the time to <i>under</i>state the dangers of nuclear weapons, that they are in the end just fairly large bombs, etc. Or perhaps just tell the truth, which is that they are dangerous and devastating, yes, but their effects have historically been overstated for the reasons discussed above.<p>Also, remember, part of what makes these nation states marginal is their lack of solid leadership and control. Iran right now thinks that a nuke is their meal ticket, but based on my reading of their own internal turmoil I would consider it a nontrivial possibility that if a nuke does show up there very significant internecine conflicts would begin and it's impossible to know who would actually end up with it; even if the current leadership retained control of the country the nuke may end up with somebody else. (Actually, the probability of the Iranian nuke actually ending up going off <i>in Iran</i> due to internal conflicts I would consider nontrivial, though certainly low odds relatively speaking.)",1292518734

I suspect, though don't have evidence to back it, that this type of problem extends beyond just paypal - to all merchant accounts and processors.<p>I've found that there is another problem related to payments too.  Fraudulent chargebacks.  Small businesses often aren't good at following up on things and end up throwing a lot of money away because some customers habitually do chargebacks for things like ""don't recognize charge,"" etc... and then get their money refunded because the business owner doesn't reply to the request quickly enough (the window to reply is very short).<p>I don't know if any services address this or not, but I would be interested in helping to solve problems around merchant accounts.<p>If there were a centralized site that people like WillyDmz could go to then maybe the individual could garner a bigger voice.  How cool would it be to see how much money any specific merchant is holding back?  Maybe a site like this could get a little more attention.<p>What do you think?

There's a small lie in this.  The web site is actually a statically generated ""wiki"".  When it was first devised I didn't have the facility to run scripts on my host.  I generate the pages as plain text with some mark-down, then off-line generate the entire site.  Then I upload the parts that have changed.<p>If you try to edit then your suggested new version gets emailed to me, where it goes through an aggressive spam filter.  Then it sits in my inbox for me to decide if it's a good change.  If so, I trigger a refresh.  Some people have passwords that trigger the refresh automatically, without my intervention, so it really does work as a limited access wiki.<p>Er, right.  Is that what you wanted to know?",1292518602

2012602,comment,2010016,2011276,0,0,grandalf,,,"As for imperial motivations, I think that's the strongest claim I made.<p>I think there are generally two perspectives on US intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan:<p>The idealist perspective is that we invaded to thwart evil and to decrease the chances of domestic terrorism in the US.<p>The realist perspective is that wars are not about good and evil but about land and resources, and that the rest of the rhetoric is just a veneer added to help sell the war.<p>Iraq is the most valuable piece of land in the middle east.  Afghanistan is also tremendously valuable.  Perhaps my mention of them being the 51st and 52nd US states was hyperbole, but clearly the US wants to install client regimes in both places.<p>What are the characteristics of a client regime?  Democracy is not usually valued all that much (hence our removal of democratically elected leaders around the world), thuggery is tolerated (hence the bribing of Afghan warlords, etc.) and all that is expected is that the state do the US's bidding in exchange for military protection and often aid.<p>In terms of military strategy, all this makes sense.  You want to use soft power... better to bribe some warlords than to risk American lives, etc.  Better to install a client regime that will prevent a possible enemy from consolidating power, etc.<p>The issue I have with this is that most people fail to see this as the brutal power projection of a massive empire.<p>In my opinion, we can't have it both ways... we can't be a pluralistic, free society and also cause so much suffering via our imperial ""churn"".<p>If you read the essay that Condi wrote in Foreign Affairs a few years ago in which she described in detail the ""Bush Doctrine"", you'll notice that she musters her significant academic training in an attempt to merge the notion of free society values with imperial power projection.<p>In my view, any explanation boils down to saying ""We're going to civilize those savages, even if we have to kill quite a few to do so"".<p>At this point, the side-effects of past Imperial actions are nearly impossible to differentiate from organic events.  What we do know is that Al Qaida was largely a consequence of US efforts to  use soft power to kick the Soviets out of Afghanistan, that Saddam had received significant military aid from the US, and that the US overthrew democratically elected regimes in Iran.<p>None of it was done for any abstract value such as freedom, but simply to control a very valuable area and attempt to create client regimes there (or prevent others from doing so), since such machinations are cheaper than US soldiers' lives and represent the use of ""economy of force"" compared to all-out war/conquest.",1292517819

Most subliminal messaging only works if the recipient is willing to accept the idea that the advertisers want to plant; social engineering and NLP are topics many hackers on HN would find interesting. Analytical psychology is interesting too but far fewer would be into the more esoteric side of Jung's thought.<p>Plenty of experiments have been done on strobe flashing images and sets of images on a subject's eyes. The end result is, generally, that the psyche becomes upset and the person irritated - it's kind of like having a religious zealot push their ideas onto you; if you're set in other beliefs, the experience is only irritating (if not enraging). This is where NLP, hypnosis (the real thing, not the wave a flame in your face and make you stop smoking thing), and manipulation of a person's feelings by eliciting their key feeling words comes into play.<p>Best example and it's a dead obvious one, would be having a scene with Kim Kardashian in a slightly revealing getup talking to the audience of a movie theater and walking about while sipping on a big coke bottle. People that may not like coke may find Kim sexually arousing which generates social proof for the product in her hand and may loosen (but not fully convert) that consumer's dislike of the product. Case in point: I generally don't like Coca-Cola and it always make me feel crappy after drinking it (bloated, too much sugar, etc...) but I <i>love</i> to drink it at the theater. It just ""tastes"" good when I drink it at the theater because over time, through a combination of real life psychological links and the clever advertising Coke does in the theaters for its product I've grown to actually <i>enjoy</i> it when I'm at the theater. Now, that doesn't mean I actually purchase one when at the theater (I don't drink soda) but I am aware of the bridge created in my psyche.<p>[EDIT] I realize the OP's comment was actually on <i>technological</i> innovation and had nothing to do with what I ended up talking about.

2012536,comment,2011805,2011805,0,0,detokaal,,,"I have been a teacher for over 20 years.  My tenure has been 1/2 in an upper middle class  community and the recent 1/2 in an inner city school with a 50% graduation rate and 80% free and reduced lunch rate.<p>What bothers me about this question is the word ""innovation.""  It is too big.  From a learning standpoint, there is no need for innovation.  Research is pretty clear about the methods by which learning takes place.  We have decades of materials and studies and experience.  Of course there is always new research that might put a fine point on some of these methods, but the basics are well-known.<p>From a teaching standpoint, there has some been innovation in the last 15-20 years.  This comes primarily from technology in the form of brain scans and neuroscience.  Even still, good teachers have been using methods that take advantage of this knowledge.  But we used it before we knew how it actually worked.  Good teaching hasn't changed as a result, but we are able to show (and convince) new teachers why you should use a given methodology.<p>From a technology standpoint (since this is HN I assume that is the direction you want to go), don't waste your time.  Computers in classrooms are just another tool, like a TV or pencil or book.  Technology is just another body of knowledge students are expected to know before they graduate.  We have had enough studies now that show putting computers in classrooms make no difference in outcomes.  It is only helpful if a teacher is trained to use that tool, in the same way that a teacher is trained to use books and notes.  Effectiveness is dependent on its use and not merely its presence.<p>The current classroom innovations in education, and the ones making the most impact in our schools, and many others, are human relationships.  (I will address innovation outside the classroom in the next paragraph).  Students who connect to teachers learn more in that class.  Period.  They show up to school, they listen, they are more likely to do the work, they are more interested in the material.  This has been the saddest revelation to me in my teaching career.  These kids in inner city schools have no dad, many times no mother and are usually one of several children by different fathers.  All of them know of someone personally or an immediate family member in prison, or dead from violence or addictions.  They are transient with no permanent home.  In short, they are desperate for an adult to care about them.  They live day to day and never learn skills like organizing, planning, or time management.  They have no role model, and it is very difficult to be one as a teacher when you have 35 kids in your classroom for 40 minutes a day.  Until a student knows you care, they don't care what you know or what you have to show them.  It helps if they have a parent who values education, but those are rare.  Many students tell me their parents dropped out of high school and they still have a house and food and car and cell phone.  They do, but it is provided by the government.<p>The biggest innovation to be made is in the structure.  Everything is broken.  Everything.  Steve Jobs summed it up nicely.  I'll add that as long as education remains a political issue, politicians with assume control with regulations and laws that benefit the most powerful voters - the voters most likely to re-elect them.  For a long time that was unions.  It is currently shifting to parents.   In some places, business wields the most influence.  Let parents decide where to send their students.  Give their money back and let it follow the kids.   Free teachers to achieve a set of standards using the methods and tools most appropriate for their communities.  The standards don't need to change, but the freedom to teach in the way that is best for your current group of kids has been taken away.<p>That's enough - nothing is going to change.",1292516786

This means you have more incoming links, but they are incoming links from pages with higher rankings.  Incoming links from lower ranked pages - pages with few incoming links - don't give you much ""Google Juice"".<p>I'm curious, do people really not know this?  Should I write it up?

I disagree with your point on resources.<p>Energy wise, the people in the city use far less. But that is mostly becuase they have smaller apartments and use less heat. Give everyone in the suburbs 800 sq ft and then run the comparison again.<p>You definition of ""resource"" is a little strange. Would the pebbles in the asphalt on a street in NYC see more tires run over them per year than the pebbles in the asphalt in the suburbs. Probably true. When you look at the cost of maitaining a mile of road in NYC and compare it to a mile of road in the suburbs, the difference is striking. You are spending 10x+ for everything in the city because it is a logistics nightmare.<p>Even something as simple as a dedicated fiber line for a business, in the suburbs they can just run a line underground easily. In the city, it is a major problem becuase everything underground is already filled, so it comes down to getting a permit to run a line through the underground manholes (an existing, and very limited, resource) and it can be difficult if not impossible.<p>Not to mention compare a house made of 2x4s, plywood, to one made of steel and brick. Wood grows back. Steel doesn't. Steel also uses an insane amount of energy. And construction in the city is very time consuming, energy consuming, and expensive.",1292515483

Instead of coming up with interesting information and vetting it for their readers they mostly just spew whatever thoughts they had that day onto the page. It doesn't take a huge amount of effort, but the signal to noise ratio is also very low.<p>With the rise of Facebook and Twitter, narcissistic blogging can happen more in the sphere you want it (your friend group). Narcissistic bloggers are usually doing it for attention and their friends' and acquaintances' attention is more important than strangers'.<p>Altruistic bloggers, on the other hand, have useful information to present so they want to present it to as large an audience as possible.

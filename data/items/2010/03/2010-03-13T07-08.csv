Price is to high, subscription fee is show stopper for me.<p>Long answer:<p>Home use<p>Why will be home owner or tenant bothered by power use?<p>First group - people bothered by energy cost. The calculation is simple: the cost of hardware and accumulated subscription fees has to be recouped by energy cost savings in one year.<p>Yearly subscriptions fee $120, hardware cost, say, $200 gives $320 cost of the first year use of the service.<p>Energy cost $0.1 per kWh so we have to save at 3200 kWh per year to break out our investment.<p>3200 kWh per year means, if power consumption is constant, reducing energy draw by about 0.37 kW.<p>Doable, but is it easy?<p>Replace incandescent light bulbs by more energy efficient compact fluorescent light bulbs or led light bulbs. Done.<p>Is cost sensitive home owner the target group? He can be if the price is right. Read - low enough. So - mass production, lower cost per hardware unit, lot of subscriptions sold on ongoing basis. Well, there is one problem. Up front spend on hardware batch. And second one. How to reach these cost sensitive home owners? Marketing. Which means more money up front. Which means more risk. By the way, that means competing on price what is not the best idea for someone starting with limited funds.<p>Second group - people bothered by Earth future, global warming.<p>Each saved kilowatt hour means less about 2.3 lb (1 kg) of CO2 emitted to atmosphere. Saving 3 kWh daily during a year means about 1000 kg less CO2 emitted to atmosphere.<p>How reach people bothered by Earth future? It looks little bit easier. Is it easy enough?<p>Third group - early adopters, geeks looking for new gadget.<p>The new cool gadget has a little drawback. It is clipped on the electrical wires, presumably in the hidden electrical box. How to show it to other geeks? There is website with fancy graphs, twitter integration, facebook integration and, of course, iPhone application. And some game mechanics, a little competition: who has smaller energy consumption, who is greener so can be awarded by, say, more images of green leaves. Or bigger tree image. Or blue ribbon. Or ...<p>This group looks easier to target. It has another nice feature. Virtually all of them can be called linkerati, which leads to some nice side effects. Links, SEO, boost in visibility.<p>Industrial and commercial use<p>One 10 kW motor working all year long uses 86400 kWh. Let's assume energy costs $0.05 per kWh. Yearly cost: $4320.<p>Completely different game.<p>Industrial environment is harsh. Electromagnetic noise level is really high despite all countermeasures. Current in wires is hardly sinusoidal because of all theses nonlinear power receivers (eg. frequency converters).<p>What savings are possible in industrial environment?<p>Use less energy. Use GridSpy for ad hoc power monitoring during machine tunning. Possible for air conditioning, refrigeration, making compressed air, pumping.<p>Use cheaper energy - prices vary during the day and week. Locating low hanging fruit.<p>Do not pay for use more power than contracted. Add an ability to alarm someone if there is to much power drawn, allow to change the formula for power calculation. Example: power calculated as 15 minutes average or an 1 hour average.<p>Do not pay for too low power factor. Power factor monitoring and alarm someone.<p>Another beast is data reflecting production put on the internet. I know, passwords, vendor commitment to security etc. but ... Btw. this concern exists for home use too.<p>Despite that all energy conservation is an interesting field.",1268466676

The reason why I care about mistakes like ""your"" vs ""you're"" is when there's a limited number of cues available it can help to evaluate someone's competence.<p>In my mind the question is: If this person doesn't care enough to get this detail right--in this situation where it's about a detail I know about--how can I trust them to get the details right in a situation I know nothing about?<p>This approach does come with a downside--I probably spend too much time forming written communication trying to make sure it's ""right"". Like this comment, for example. :)<p>So, for me, it's not just about mindless adherence to arbitrary rules but a potential pointer to a deeper quality. However, you are free to continue not to be interested in me. :)",1268465958

1188644,story,,,88,28,bpang,"Stanford Research on Happiness and Meaning",,"I'm currently taking a class from Prof. Jennifer Aaker at Stanford GSB. She's known for research on happiness - quite a profound topic. Here are some findings I thought are interesting:<p>50% of it is determined by birt or genetics. Circumstances such as marital status, earnings, and looks determine 10%, and the remainder comes from intentional activities or things we can do to change our happiness level.<p>Researchers postulate that each individual has a ""set point"" for happiness, which is largely determined by birth and genes. Deviations from that point tend to be short-lived.<p>How does money affect happiness? Once people are free from deprivation, the tie between money and happiness begins to fray. There's generally positive correlation but money yields diminishing returns.<p>Middle-class and affluent people are often stuck on a ""hedonic treadmill"" as they sacrifice personal relationships for diminishing returns.<p>They why do people pursue wealth? Psychologists argue that they are seeking ""positional advantage."" Most people are happy with less money on one condition - ""everyone else is also making less.""<p>In contrast, traits such as self-confidence and energy correlated with happiness.<p>What can we do to be happier?<p>(1) Time shift: First how many hours of deep, hard thinking do you get done each day?<p>(2) Work on projects you LOVE (not like): It releases happiness in your brain! People become more effective when the brain releases endorphines!<p>(3) Reframe expectations: An example: http://bit.ly/LouisCK10 People take technology for granted today and forget about the very recent past. Lowering expectations brings happiness. Take yourself less seriously.<p>(4) Create a reward system: Rewards make people happy. Try to create rewards, even small ones.<p>(5) Carve out clear areas of incompetence: Claim areas of incompetence! Admit it.<p>(6) Cultivate emotion contagion<p>(7) Create sticky memories: the ""who"" and ""what"" are important. Research (in the US) has also found that morning and night memories are stickier, as well as Christmas - the most memorable holiday.
A few tips:
""Perceived"" free time is important!
Social skills: Typically there are 8 close committed relationships. family, close friends, siblings, partners, etc.
Dancing: makes people happy!
Volunteering: People who report time and money report greater well-being! 
Being Part of SOmething Bigger
Not money! you just need enough money to live happily. Research also found that spending money on your friends and people you care actually makes you happier.<p>(8) Improve sense of humor!<p>She also discussed the ""Six Selves Model"": friends, parent, partner, work, community/spirituality, and health, which are the foundations of personal happiness. Try to allocate time over these different areas. Although you can be very busy, identify ""temporal sweetspots"". Allocate quality attention to each spot, even if it's temporal. She further suggested listing favorite traditions to build habits.",1268465243

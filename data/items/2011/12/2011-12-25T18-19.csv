3391380,comment,3388290,3388500,2,0,emu,,,"Well, unfortunately most interesting static analysis problems are undecidable. There can be no ""general"" solution.<p>What we have in practice are approximations and heuristics; over time we will develop better approximations for the kinds of code people write in practice. Unfortunately fragility of analysis will always be a problem; if you change your code just a little bit then reasoning may fail.<p>As someone who has spent years doing research on shape analysis my personal belief is that the dream of a fully automated ""find my bugs"" static analysis is unrealistic. Some of the problems you must solve to analyze the heap, say, are very hard indeed.<p>We need to think more about the interactions between language design and verification, rather than hoping that people will build better tools to analyze existing code. Strong typing (e.g., the Hindley-Milner type system) is one example of a sweet spot that demonstrates how language design (type annotation, type declarations) interacts with tools (type inference, type checking). Type systems are some of the most widely used bug finding tools today. Trying to build verification tools without considering language design is always going to be difficult.",1324838843

We must not merely have more kids but change our way of seeing kids, we have to want to have more kids since merely the physical acts of 'having more kids' without the corresponding investment of human capital in raising them would be among the greatest of crimes.<p>Isn't it telling to the profundity of the problem when we're initially not sure what to do with a problem so fundamental?<p>Kind of like an indebted person taking a long time to discover that he must make more money and spend less than he has. The answer is so simple the fact that we find ourselves in the problem can become a self-parody.<p>The micro-economic reality is that having kids is expensive, time consuming and seen by many as squandering talented people's time, yet how do these talented smart people ever expect to transfer humanity if the next generation is not being produced? Or not being produced in sufficient numbers? We can make all the advancements in the world but if we don't pass humanity on to the next generation in a sustainable way we can just as quickly devolve into what we were a few 100 years back, or worse.<p>A colony of wild animals has a problem where the most fit members virtually stop having offspring there's either massive mutation of the colony en route or the species is in trouble.<p>Having and raising kids is a procurement that once you really realize we lack as a society it's already to late to avoid some very extreme consequences.",1324838487

3391362,comment,3390081,3390822,3,0,langsamer,,,"I would recomend some social ""stretching"" techniques. Tim Ferris talks about them in his book 4-hr work week:<p>1. Make eye-contact. Make a conscious effort to do this. Pick one eye and stick to it. Make eye-contact on passer-bys on the street. If they cause trouble, just say ""Sorry, you just look really familiar""<p>2. Get phone numbers. The goal will be to get numbers from attractive females/males. Remember the real goal is not to get the numbers but get over the fear of asking, so the outcomes are unimportant. A mall is a great place to try this. He recommends to get over the discomfort quickly, ask three people in a row within five minutes. Here's an example script he provides.<p>""Excuse me, I know this is going to sound strange, but if I don't ask you know, I'll be kicking myself for the rest of the day. I'm running to meet a friend [i.e., I have friends and am not a stalker], but I think you're really [extremely, drop dead] cute [gorgeous, hot]. Could I have your phone number? I'm not a psycho, I promise. You can give me a fake one if you're not interested.""<p>3. Relax in public. Simply lie down in the middle of a crowded public place at some point. It can be a well trafficked sidewalk, the middle of a popular Starbucks, or a popular bar. There is no real technique. Just lie down and remain silent on the ground for 10 seconds. Then get up and continue with what you were doing. Don't explain it at all.<p>I've done the first two and it was a bit difficult at first, but over time it becomes totally second nature. At that point you can talk to anyone about anything without feeling timid. When that confidence builds up, I find that your passions come out naturally as you converse with that person since you don't have any insecurities hindering your thoughts.",1324838354

3391356,comment,3388290,3388625,2,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"Haskell's type system is really not at all comparable to the ones found in c and Java. Not only is the Haskell type system Turing-complete, I'd be willing to argue that it's more expressive (and I mean the type system itself, not the whole language...) than a lot of mainstream languages. Basically, it's a whole different animal from the things most programmers call type systems.<p>For example, the type system doesn't just handle values, doing actions is also managed by the type system. The type of main is IO (), which roughly means ""do something with side-effects"". If I write a function that reads in a file and returns a string, it's type is not String, it's IO String, or, ""do an action, which causes a String to be returned"". I can shuffle this around at will, and use the IO monad to handle running the program in correct order. And IO is just a <i>single</i> way of managing order -- continuation passing is just another monad in the type system, that didn't even need any additional code in the compiler to implement.<p>But what really makes the difference from Java or C++ imho is the type inference. Basically, if you never write a type declaration, the only time the type system bothers you is when there really is a bug in the code. Psychologically, this is a big deal. In Java, the type system is a chore that makes me type unnecessary things. In Haskell, the type system is a compile-time check that catches a lot of real errors.",1324837934

Instead Khan has a monopoly as the one man show.</i><p>I do like this, because while one teacher may excel at math teaching their format may not work so well for other academic studies. A system of user ranking and teacher submissions could be pretty cool. If it where me I would build it so their is a strict topic, such as addition or real numbers and then people can submit videos for that detailed topic. Then an entire math curriculum can be built out of the top rated videos with all the other videos available by rank from best to worst. This would allow for someone that just does not get the recommended teachers style or format to work down the recommended videos until they find one that can convey the format in a manner that they understand. We seem to keep looking for the one pinnacle of teaching formats, which is a silver bullet, it does not exist, they is not one style that can convey every concept to every person.

My guess is that the only bubble is the one inside Eric Schmidt's head that makes it impossible for him to acknowledge those who share common cause with Occupy Wall Street: jobs that don't pay poverty wages, housing as a right, protection from a banking system that tax payers (yes, even those making poverty wages) had to bail out while their schools get sold out, and a government that is actually responsible to the majority rather than the minority which increasingly controls the wealth of this world. The growth of Silicon Valley, or any city for that matter, should not be taken as meaning that we have escaped poverty or unemployment. Far more likely is that the cities that boom have been attractive to business specifically because they have a surplus of low wage workers (again it takes more than engineers to make Silicon Valley run), government subsidized land, adequate transportation built with tax payer money, etc. The high unemployment rate in Santa Clara quoted in the article should give Eric pause but he'd likely just consider that of minor concern because of the fraction of residents that are not hurting (who he wants to continue attracting to the area).",1324836194

The developer documentation at Apple indicates that they also support these within C++, and has a small section on how they behave within it.   So, at least, they went the extra mile and worked out the C++ parsing issues.<p><a href=""http://developer.apple.com/mac/articles/cocoa/introblocksgcd.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.apple.com/mac/articles/cocoa/introblocksgcd...</a>",1252684797

Why not produce 5 in a class, bounce around perspectives, ideals etc, and have people reflect on how their group performed- challenges, successes and weaknesses.<p>Sure the client sorta gets a taste of spec work startup style but the students can potentially learn more and feel like they have more skin in the game due to smaller groups.<p>The competitive edge makes it fun as well.",1252684360

Zawinski: I still write new screen savers every now and then just for kicks, and that’s all C.<p>Seibel: Do you use some kind of IDE for that?<p>Zawinski: I just use Emacs, mostly. Though recently, I ported XScreenSaver to OS X. The way I did that was I reimplemented Xlib in terms of Cocoa, the Mac graphics substrate, so I wouldn’t have to change the source code of all the screen savers. They’re still making X calls but I implemented the back end for each of those. And that was in Objective C, which actually is a pretty nice language. I enjoyed doing that. It definitely feels Java-like in the good ways but it also feels like C.
Because it’s essentially C, you can still link directly with C code and just call the functions and not have to bend over backwards.""<p>............................................<p>""Seibel: Six or seven being the whole Netscape development team or the Unix development team?<p>Zawinski: That was the whole client team. There were also the server folks who were implementing their fork of Apache, basically. We didn’t talk to them much because we were busy. We had lunch with them, but that was it. So we figured out what we wanted to be in the thing and we divided up the work so that there were, I guess, no more
than two people working on any part of the project. I was doing the Unix side and Lou Montulli did most of back-end network stuff. And Eric Bina was doing layout and Jon Mittelhauser and Chris Houck were doing the Windows front end and Aleks Toti and Mark Lanett were doing the Mac front end for the pre–version 1.0 team. Those teams grew a little bit after that. But we’d have our meetings and then go
back to our cubicles and be heads-down for 16 hours trying to make something work.<p>""
...........................................<p>""They thought just by virtue of being here, they were bound for glory doing it their way. But when they were doing it their way, at their company, they failed. So when the people who had been successful said to them, “Look, really, don’t use C++; don’t use threads,” they said, “What are you talking about? You don’t know anything.”
Well, it was decisions like not using C++ and not using threads that made us ship the product on time. The other big thing was we always shipped all platforms simultaneously; that was another thing they thought was just stupid. “Oh, 90 percent of people are using
Windows, so we’ll focus on the Windows side of things and then we’ll port it later.” Which is what many other failed companies have done. If you’re trying to ship a cross-platform product, history really shows that’s how you don’t do it. If you want it to really be cross-platform, you have to do them simultaneously. The porting thing results in a crappy product on the second platform.<p>They didn’t start from scratch with a blank disk but they

817507,comment,816590,817392,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"About ""theory"", if you go down that path, we can say the same about Newton's. Few high school teachers in their right mind will mention that this theory is actually false, displaced by relativity, but nevertheless a good approximation at relatively low levels of energy. They simply present the Newton's three laws of motion as a fact. Unlike Newton's, evolution theory is currently the generally accepted theory. To present it as a fact is even more legitimate. Now, what schools <i>do</i> lack is a general explanation about theories, the certainties (or lack thereof) we have about them, and the changes in the generally accepted set of theories, past and present.<p>About ""silly"", I never understood evolution as a path from less intelligent to more intelligent. I always thought it was the survival of the <i>fittest</i> — quite a different concept. For example, I've heard about a animal which at some point in its life just eats its brain, because it's isn't needed anymore (the animal somewhat become a plant). Now, talking about intelligence as such isn't really possible, since ""intelligence"" is hardly a well defined term, let alone a measurable quantity. Complexity, on the other hand is more measurable. Why do life became more and more complex over time, I do not know. however, I do know that some complexities gave an edge to the concerned species. One of them is the eye.<p>About Darwin's fake experiments, it already has been said: it doesn't matter. His theory was amended, we have more data, and more peer reviews. Without a relatively high level of plausibility, the evolution theory would have been rejected by now. Even if it means proving the Church wrong. Now, I have not read how the book you linked addresses this catch.<p>About the perfect intelligence on the beginning of everything, it doesn't matter. It is just beyond science. That this begining was the Big Bang just fits the current observations best. Pretending that life on Earth allways was as complex as it is now is too convoluted right now to be considered a valid theory.<p>As a final note, I must add that I am not as specialist. So my only choice is to take the generaly accepted set of theories for granted. I have no right to contradict them without a great deal of knowlege in their respective domains. If the author you cited is right, that is sadly not my job to listen to him. That is the job of specialists.",1252683066

Clearly, the visa is controlled by the employer, not the employee.  And while the government does have to ""ok"" the visa, the employee does not apply directly to the government.  The employer has tremendous, overwhelming authority over who does and does not get to come into the country and get in the queue for a green card.<p>A ""points system"" like the one used in Australia (discussed in other posts here) would preserve the immigrant's freedom, but I would like to point out that an Oracle lobbyist argued fiercely against it when a congressman proposed this, saying it would be ""communistic"" to have the government, rather than corporate HR, decide who Oracle gets to hire.<p>Personally, I'm outright cynical at this point.  At first, I thought this was a design flaw, but now I'm pretty convinced that the industry <i>likes</i> the indentured nature of the visa and the extraordinary power it gives them over their employees.

My project is <a href=""http://www.obsidianportal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.obsidianportal.com</a><p>We're profitable but I still need a dayjob to pay the bills, so take my advice for what it's worth.<p>1. Shorter release schedule is always preferable.  Like others have said 2 years to launch is a really bad idea.  However, my question is: Where did you come up with these numbers?  Do you have 2 different projects, or are you setting arbitrary timelines and want to fit a project to that timeline?<p>2. Going all-in is not a bad thing.  I'm currently a ""parallel entrepreneur"" and it's very hard.  It's much easier to focus on a single thing and hit it 100% rather than focus on a lot of things at 20%.<p>3. Sysadmin is easy: sign up for a service where someone else handles it.  As a Ruby on Rails guy, I heavily recommend Blue Box hosting.  It's like having a sysadmin on the team, and it's not much more expensive than Slicehost.  It's a good skill to learn, but I'm with you: let someone else do that stuff.<p>4. It sounds like you need an idea.  I know everyone says it's the execution, not the idea, but you need _some_ idea to execute on.  I would suggest using your time now to try and find 2 things: an idea and a co-founder.  Going to local meetups, talking to people, and such would be good things to do at this stage.  Find something you can be passionate about, or else you'll never find the motivation to spend your nights & weekends on it.",1252682746

Also, isn't the second paragraph of your comment doing the exact thing you were criticizing in the first (using ""anecdotes and vague references"" to strengthen your stance)?<p>I don't think the obese are looking for an easy way out.  I think they are looking for a way to lose weight.  How many obese people do you know that haven't even tried to lose weight?<p>It is certainly true that it is physically possible for most people to lose weight (I personally took off 110 lbs and kept it off for 2 years now), the fact remains that most people who want to lose weight and try to lose weight fail.  This suggests to me that it requires some trait that the average person simply doesn't have enough of.<p>I view the situation as very similar to drug addiction.  Everyone who suffers from one knows what they need to do, and most of them try, but very few are successful.  The difference is kids aren't provided drugs like they are crap foods, and you don't need to take drugs every day to stay alive.  So in some ways obesity is even thornier (although I think the brain chemistry a dieter is up against isn't as strong as that of a drug addict).<p>Ultimately it is easy for a non-obese person to say ""this is what obese people need to do and they are choosing not to"", and maybe that feels good to you, but it accomplishes nothing.",1252682647

The solution, I think, would to be to change the way firefox handles cookies, such that I can specify that a firefox tab's cookies be isolated from the rest of my browsing. So, two questions for the HN community:<p>1. Is keeping old cookies a security risk?<p>2. How can I keep different sites cookies separate?",1255525187

Rather than thinking about the next technical project, focus on revenue and income and let that drive your technical direction.<p>Seems like your product might be in a good position to get some local advertising revenue.  There are probably lots of smaller independent businesses that cater to hikers and would love to boost their traffic.  Spend some time talking with them.<p>UPDATE:
Perhaps collect some information regarding the most frequently accessed locations on your maps and target businesses in that area.",1255525175

881196,comment,880814,880814,0,0,ASJS,,,"I am about to make a series of assertions without doing any research to back them up. I know that's frowned upon around here. However, this seems like a request for brainstorming rather than a request for well researched business advice. So, apologies in advance.<p>1) The psychographics for hikers and environmentalists have a bit of overlap. I think if you could provide some kind of geographically aware donation platform through the phone and the site you could do well, or at least good. Maps and location are compelling ways to get disparate related pieces of information into one view. In this case it would be threats to a given piece of land, and organizations working to protect that same land. I would imagine folks might be feeling a bit more charitable after experiencing nature's majesty first hand.<p>2) Good country walks, not quite hikes more like a couple hours in the woods with the dogs, are hard to find without a good deal of local knowledge. This would mean a lot of research into small land trusts.<p>3) Based on the massive number of catalogues I get from companies catering to, uh, ""sportsmen"" there are a huge number of gadget obsessed hunters and fishermen out there (or at least aspirational hunters and fishermen) with money to spend. Find a way to reach them.<p>Godspeed sir.",1255525138

Also using terms like ""virtual machine"" with respect to C is plainly ridiculous and a case of bullshit baffles brains.<p>Turbo Pascal vs C? Really? In its time Turbo Pascal was an amazing piece of software but in the grand scheme of things it is a pimple compared to the whale that is C. Please compare all software written in Turbo Pascal as opposed to C if you have any doubts. The same goes for Smalltalk, Lisp, Algol 60/68. All great products/languages but very niche.<p>Fortran can be faster than C in some areas but again it is a niche language.<p>I could go on a lot more but quite frankly I don't think your post merits much more discussion and is borderline trollish.",1357837156

5038053,comment,5037230,5037230,5,0,kafkaesque,,,"From a marketing point of view, yes, all this branding stuff is pretty accurate. I write for a living with varying success rates and we do all this stuff on our business blog.<p>One constructive criticism I have is that, contrary to what the OP says, people (especially business/admin/management people) love lists. And they love when, in an enumerated list, there are pithy sentences in bold summarizing a given point. People also love sub-headings. It allows readers to quickly scan your article and find specific things they're looking for or look for things that may interest them. Most of these types of people do not actually read long articles either. That whole Keep It Simple Stupid and stuff.<p>Having said that, and to add a bit of balance, it depends what purpose your blog serves. I have a personal blog which verges on the 'academic portfolio' side of things, and it couldn't be more different. I have zero ads, no SEO, few links, and as few images as possible. I do enough marketing at work that drives me up the wall, however.<p>My personal blog focuses on content and writing organically. I use categories to organise the content. I never use tags, though I might change this. I try to write on esoteric topics and sometimes touch upon rare or hard-to-find vinyl records. I rarely write on controversial topics, mostly because my 'controversial' opinions would require a longer explanation; I don't have time to write them and people would most likely not read them in their entirety, yet still either feel offended or it would cause them to write an inaccurate, incomplete reply/rebuttal.",1357837015

5038040,comment,5037089,5037853,32,0,madhadron,,,"The Burroughs was a stack machine, but that's only the beginning. Look at how it handled addressing hunks of memory. Bounds checked memory block references were a hardware type, and they were the only way to get a reference to a block of memory. So basically, null pointers didn't exist at the hardware level, nor out of bounds writes to arrays or strings. Similarly, code and data were distinguished in memory (by high order bits), so you couldn't execute data. It simply wasn't recognized as code by the processor. Also interesting, the Burroughs machines were built to use a variant of ALGOL 60 as both their systems programming language (as in, there wasn't an assembly language beneath it) and as their command language. The whole architecture was designed to run high level procedural languages.<p>C defines a virtual machine consisting of a single, contiguous block of memory with consecutive addresses, and a single core processor that reads and executes a single instruction at a time. This is not true of today's processors, thanks to multicores, multiple pipelines, and layers of cache.",1357836906

She clearly cites why she does't use them anymore (because the company publicly tweeted she was using them, which anyone would be bent over), and the kid had the gall to say that she lacked class for not thanking him for a free trial. A. Free. Trial. And his biggest issue is that she never gave him free publicity for a service that she was trialing.

Your rule excludes a meaningful usage and includes a ridiculous one.<p>I'm not saying that Common Lisp reduces to s-expressions and syntax extension or even that ""lispness"" does, only that s-expressions and syntax extension are the features to which the denotation ""a lisp"" most frequently refers.<p>Incidentally, I program in Common Lisp for a living and am the author of several libraries in several lisp dialects, which, while not enjoying much use, do demonstrate a working knowledge of the language family.

You could maybe admire the decades of work put into C compilers, but not C the language itself for it.<p>Also, if you criticize high-level languages for being far removed from the computer it would be fair to point out that wider understood ""development interactivity"" of C compared to something like Smalltalk is rather bad. Consider also that this removal from the computer could be as much an argument against our current computer architecture as it is an argument against high-level programming languages. That we have invested decades into a technology and can't easily switch to a different one doesn't mean we should stay uncritical about its weaknesses.<p><i>Ubiquitous Debuggers and Useful Crash Dumps</i><p>I suspect this is a sign of disappointment with Erlang, where debugging seems to be a complete mess, the last time I was doing some development in it I had to fire up some really weird looking debugger and run the program under it just to get something reassembling a stack trace with the filename and line number for the error I got in the program. But you do have lots of debuggers and crash dumps in the JVM for example and I don't think you all that often need to examine the level below the JVM when debugging JVM-based programs. It's somewhat funny to praise C for being convenient in interactions with other C code.<p><i>Contrast this to OO languages where codebases tend to evolve massive interdependent interfaces of complex types, where the arguments and return types are more complex types and the complexity is fractal, each type is a class defined in terms of methods with arguments and return types or more complex return types.</i><p>I don't know what this is even supposed to mean. From what I know most large scale C programs end up desperately trying to emulate some of the features of higher-level languages to create more strict module boundaries and prevent implementation details from breaking the library interfaces.",1357835960

In descending order:<p>1) We generally have pretty tight revenue targets, so one thing I and my teams do now is forecast out expected revenue on a daily basis for the next 30 days, as revenue is highly dependent on a stream of new content, features and what we call live ops.<p>Live ops are basically a combination of promotions, contests, events and tournaments. We have decent tools, so we can generally spin up a live op in a matter of minutes to a couple hours without doing an engineering push. We also have content we can release with a few hours of work, so if today is not going to go well, it gives us enough time to prep something for tomorrow.<p>It's highly useful to know if a Live Op or new feature/content release is ""working"" or not. With the real time dashboard and experience, I can know with high confidence whether it's working within 30 minutes of release, which gives me more than enough time to spin something else up so that we don't lose the day.<p>2) On many days, we actually do multiple releases or live ops in a single game -- the pace of releases is fast even compared to other web companies. As unscientific as this is, it's often easier for me to evaluate/get a feel for the impact of a release/live op based on how much it moves the projection in the first hour after release, and before the next thing comes along.<p>Obviously with stuff like that, you validate after the fact against more full data, but I've found after looking at this lot for over a year, I have a strong ""feel"" for what's working and what's not.<p>3) Related to 1) and 2), but I've found that using the tool gives me a much tighter feedback loop. When I make a feature release or live op and I'm sitting on the dashboard watching the release move or not move the projection, I have a much tighter feel on the impact. Most of my peers who don't have something like this often are not as rigorous in understanding and evaluating the different levers they have to impact revenue.",1357834742

There are ""high level languages"" which offer a large amount of abstraction and those which offer less. Right there are two spectra which can be used to classify languages, and C is stuck near the extreme lower left corner. (A minimal language which offers less abstraction.) Then you have languages like Lisp and Smalltalk which are even more minimal, but which offer higher degrees of abstraction.

Its virtual machine does not match modern architectures very well, and its explicitness about details of its machine mean FORTRAN compilers typically produce faster code. The C virtual machine does not provide an accurate model of why your code is fast on a modern machine. The social necessity of implementing a decent C compiler may have stifled our architecture development (go look at the Burroughs systems, or the Connection Machine, and tell me how well C's virtual machine maps to them).<p>- C's standard library is a joke. Its shortcomings, particularly around string handling, have been responsible for an appalling fraction of the security holes of the past forty years.<p>- C's tooling is hardly something to brag about, especially compared to its contemporaries like Smalltalk and Lisp. Most of the debuggers people use with C are command line monstrosities. Compare them to the standard debuggers of, say, Squeak or Allegro Common Lisp.<p>- Claiming a fast build/debug/run cycle for C is sad. It seems fast because of the failure in this area of C++. Go look at Turbo Pascal if you want to know how to make the build/debug/run cycle fast.<p>- Claiming that C is callable from anywhere via its standard ABI equates all the world with Unix. Sadly, that's almost true today, though, but maybe it's because of the ubiquity of C rather than the other way around.<p>So, before writing about the glories of C, please go familiarize yourself with modern FORTRAN, ALGOL 60 and 68, Turbo Pascal's compiler and environment, a good Smalltalk like Squeak or Pharo, and the state of modern pipelines processor architectures.",1357834087

Startups don't have the power or money to enforce a monopoly.<p>Where did I stop talking about startups? All the participants, including startups, that compete for the same market would have the incentive to merge or collude, but only if they can ensure that no one defects or fails to join, because the first defector breaks the monopoly (especially in software where there is effectively infinite reproduction capacity). And they (startups included) could reliably do that with contracts and buyouts if it wasn't illegal, in any market with sufficiently few qualified participants. But it is illegal, which is why even startups don't -- not because it will necessarily be enforced against the startup during the first merger, but because they know that <i>if it works</i> and they ultimately achieve the end goal of a monopoly or cartel, that is what will raise antitrust scrutiny. So we don't start down that road because we know where it currently goes.<p>Also, I never intended to limit what I'm talking about to startups: I used a startup as an example, but this applies generally. Non-startup small businesses could benefit from working together in similar ways. (As could large businesses, though that quickly becomes the exemplification of why we don't allow it -- again, we still need <i>something</i> to address that.)<p>And I would also point out that trotsky started talking about mergers so I wrote to address that, but collusion would probably be easier and more manageable, especially if it could be legally enforced between business entities through contracts.<p>>More than that, you're ignoring the reality of a merger which would be a lot of corporate politics ending up with most of the originals founders getting kicked out. The handful who played the game the best will end up getting the whole pie.<p>How, if they <i>all</i> have to continue colluding in order for it to work? If you have unhappy former competitors they can quickly become happy future competitors. The only deal that works is the one that makes all the former competitors better off than they would have been otherwise. That might involve some of them not being involved in the operations anymore, but they would still get a piece of the pie.",1357833956

It has a lot of excellent languages that are all radically different (Clojure, Haskell, Python, Scala, Erlang) and each is really cool in some ways and very infuriating in others. C, of course, is really cool in some ways and very infuriating in others as well.<p>I've taken up learning C, and my feeling about it is that it's not a ""jump in and figure it out"" language, in the way that most technologies are, because you're absolutely right. Naive or ""cargo cult"" C is going to be a disaster from a security, code-quality, and production stability perspective.<p>For most technologies to qualify as safe, sane, and consensual, they have to be secure even when wielded by a programmer who cobbled together incomplete knowledge from a few dozen Internet articles about how to do stuff. Not C. There are ""quick adoption"" technologies with quick learning curves and ""lifer"" technologies that are quirky and hard to learn at first but provide long-lived knowledge. C is a lifer language. If you don't treat it as such, you'll faceplant.",1357833849

But you just can't shake the feeling that ""this will be better two revisions from now.""<p>Take an exceedingly simple example: load up Hacker News, then look at the screen as you rotate the phone from portrait to landscape and back. On an iPhone 5, the rotation is smooth. On the Lumia 920, you see flashes of white as the screen is repainted in the new orientation.<p>Yeah, this is window dressing, but it part of the user experience. This kind of attention to the user experience is missing throughout WP8. For example, the user interface relies heavily on glyphs (minimalistic icons), but doesn't use them consistently. In the Camera app, to get to the Photo Roll, you click an arrow icon. Does an arrow make me immediately think of my other photos? iOS uses a thumbnail of your most recent photo.<p>And I think Nokia made a huge mistake with the form factor. Over the weekend I was trying to surf HN while feeding my baby, and I thought I was going to drop the phone on her. The extra weight (60% heavier than an iPhone) makes it that much harder to rely on friction to keep it in your hand. There is no way it would be a comfortable fit for my wife or my mom. The Lumia 820 is probably a better ""appropriate for everyone"" phone, but with a low-res screen, etc, it's not positioned that way.",1357833659

You can think of it as ZenDesk for open source projects.<p>The other side of that is for the benefit of developers, by matching them with the best experts and increase their chance of getting the best answers they need as fast as possible. But we don&#x27;t just depend on matching developers requests with experts. We think there&#x27;s enough content on the internet from resources like Documentation, Tutorial sites, StackOverflow questions, and blogs that we can match your request with a content/link that can help you without nagging someone.<p>This beta version of GitHelp have the core of the product. Developers can create help requests and we match them with the open source maintainers and maintainers/hackers can reply.<p>What&#x27;s next for GitHelp is the dashboard for maintainers to manage the all requests and collaborate on that, the matching with content, also the payment is coming up very soon. We focused on the Ruby community right now, but we&#x27;ll expand to other communities soon like JavaScript. Please let us know what you think!",1432123197

By &quot;refreshing&quot; every few months, they kept the issue on the agenda. Recent legislative wins in this area are almost entirely due to this strategy: in the first month after release, there was massive support behind Feinstein and her likes; now that side has slowly been eroded down to a few securocrats and the usual hawks, which is why wins are happening in courts and in Congress.<p><i>> It seems like just about every release following has been purely about legitimate foreign intelligence operations</i><p>We really don&#x27;t know how &quot;legitimate&quot; those descriptions of people hacking equipment in transit were. Besides, there is a world beyond the US -- Greenwald publishes from Brasil, he doesn&#x27;t have to follow the wishes of the US government.

I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people downplay the comparison between Snowden&#x27;s actions and Manning&#x27;s actions.  As I see it, Manning took thousands of sensitive documents that he didn&#x27;t read and handed them over to Julian Assange, but on the hand Snowden took thousands of sensitive documents that he didn&#x27;t read and handed them over to Glenn Greenwald.  Personally I think the biggest difference is that Manning owned up to what he[1] did, but Snowden washed his hands of all responsibility and insists that any harm that may have come from his actions is the fault of the media, neglecting the fact that he was responsible for the media having those documents to begin with.<p>Then there&#x27;s the issue of the reporters he chose to give the documents to, who I think have been sensationalizing the issues in order to milk these documents for as long as possible.  If Snowden had stopped at the first document that was released, I&#x27;d probably have a different opinion.  It seems like just about every release following has been purely about legitimate foreign intelligence operations, with some language thrown in to say &quot;there is no indication as to how many Americans or innocent civilians have been targeted under this program,&quot; with the implication that you, your family and loved ones may have been spied on by the NSA.  It&#x27;s a scare tactic to bring in more viewers and more advertising dollars. Every time a news outlet does actually reveal groups actually being targeted (like Russia, China, Al Qaeda, etc.), I tend to think that it&#x27;s exactly the kind of people I want the NSA to be spying on.<p>[1] Preemptively: yes, I am aware of the Bradley/Chelsea thing.  No, I am not trying to make a statement.  At the time that Pvt Manning plead guilty, he was known as Bradley.  Now she is known as Chelsea, and it just gets confusing trying to figure out which pronoun to use when referring to events in the past.",1432122428

It&#x27;s our shame the way we treat non-violent offenders. A disgrace.<p>But guys, nothing is ever 100% one way or the other, no matter how much you support it. So you have to look at differing points of view -- unless the objective is just to have a good rant.<p>Here are the things that come to mind reading this:<p>- Yep, highest incarceration rates ever. Also violent crime has been dropping to unheard-of lows and the country is safer than it ever has been<p>- Prisons are not about justice or reform. [insert really long discussion here]. Political systems exist and function for political reasons. Therefore the prison system is made and maintained to keep society together. They don&#x27;t put the guy who killed you friend in the electric chair because of justice. They do it so you don&#x27;t kill him yourself, or have a lifelong vendetta against both him and the system.<p>- This piece is written by a lawyer. Do not expect it to fairly talk about all of the options. It&#x27;s invective; well-written, emotional, powerful invective. The goal is to make you turn off your brain and feel a certain way. Treat it as such.<p>- Although this is targeted at lawyers, whatever failings there are? Most likely a result of judges and elected officials -- in other words, the public. If the public wants something, and it wanted harsher sentencing, it gets it. That means changes need to occur with the electorate, not elite legal minds<p>- If the system is broken, it&#x27;s broken. Toss out all of that racism stuff, it&#x27;s a red herring. People shouldn&#x27;t have their civil rights abused because it&#x27;s the wrong way to run a country, not because they&#x27;re a member of an oppressed minority. If you want to win this fight and fix things, toss out every other issue aside from fixing the system. Sure, use various things like incarceration rates among blacks as an argument, but only very carefully. If this is a true problem affecting everybody (and I believe it is), then don&#x27;t attach yourself to one particular cause or the other. That&#x27;s just an easy way to lose the discussion.<p>We desperately need to fix things, but that&#x27;s only going to happen if we make both impassioned and dispassionate arguments -- and only if we understand the terms at stake.

Similarly, Border Patrol cannot search vehicles in the 100-mile zone without a warrant or &quot;probable cause&quot; (a reasonable belief, based on the circumstances, that an immigration violation or crime has likely occurred).<p>> In practice, Border Patrol agents routinely ignore or misunderstand the limits of their legal authority in the course of individual stops, resulting in violations of the constitutional rights of innocent people. These problems are compounded by inadequate training for Border Patrol agents, a lack of oversight by CBP and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the consistent failure of CBP to hold agents accountable for abuse. Thus, although the 100-mile border zone is not literally &quot;Constitution free,&quot; the U.S. government frequently acts like it is.<p><a href=""https://www.aclu.org/constitution-100-mile-border-zone"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.aclu.org/constitution-100-mile-border-zone</a>",1432120500

Same gaps that Wayland has (needing development time) also are with Mir AFAIK. So once fixed for Wayland, Mir will have it easy :P<p>Note that real Mir support is only planned for 14.10. At the moment it is just XMir, which is totally different from the what is going on with Wayland (goal is native, this is way more difficult). I have seen the development that is needed to get Wayland really working, Mir seems way behind on this though they probably can copy what was done for Wayland and pretend they did it :P",1373623187

You could argue these tend to be for high paying jobs requiring special skill-set, and thus could view &#x27;complusory&#x27; internship as an extended 3-month interview.<p>But if you go and work at a start-up for free, you&#x27;re there because you want to, not because it&#x27;s expected.",1373623155

One problem for me is that I do computer science research (I&#x27;m a grad student), and I&#x27;d like to keep doing something somewhere similar after I graduate (but self-employed), but if you&#x27;re working on generic low-level computer stuff that can be re-used by everybody ad infinitum, the state will use it. I&#x27;m not a Linux kernel developer, for example, but that&#x27;s a good analogy. I don&#x27;t see a good way to stop supporting the state without giving up on doing computer science research. I&#x27;d appreciate any thoughts.<p>So, you don&#x27;t have to pay taxes (except for things like sales tax) to any state? As an American, I think I&#x27;d have to renounce my citizenship (they still make you pay taxes when you are overseas), which would probably have a number of negative impacts for me personally, such as possibly making travel difficult.<p>Overall, I&#x27;m not so sure that I agree with your conclusions, but I&#x27;m still thinking about it. Yes, I am supporting the state, but not willingly, and not quietly (though I am not vocal about my opposition to the system in my corporeal life, which wouldn&#x27;t do any good anyway in my work environment, and would probably do much harm). Actually, I&#x27;m the victim. Is a Jew working in a munitions factory in Nazi Germany morally obligated to commit suicide rather than try to ride out the war? I would say &quot;no,&quot; and I would tentatively say that about the actual situation I am in, for the same reasons.<p>My bigger concern about supporting the system as I do is that it is self-defeating (of myself). In the limit (i.e., in communism), there is no possibility for productive labor, because 100% of your earnings will be taken by the government and used against you. We are not in that situation. Still, US government action seems to be moving in the direction of making it impossible to start and run small businesses; this is already the case in some sectors, like telecom. When all there are, are large corporate giants under tight regulatory control (which is literally the model adopted by Hitler and Mussolini), we are all worker drones; it would be equally (un)productive for me personally to work a a cashier at Wal-Mart as it would be to be a software engineer. (Because you get paid approximately the same in both cases and true innovation is illegal or impossiblein both cases.) I fear that we are not all that far from that situation.",1373621865

Battery&#x27;s about the same, build quality is similar, but iPhone loses points for being either easy to scratch (black 5) or easy to crack (4, 4S). Apple in general makes stylish but not robust phones. 
iPhone loses on the form factor because it really has only one that is acceptable - the 5. I am typing this on a 4s and the screen is too small and the shape does not feel as good in the hand as the round polycarbonate Lumias.<p>CPU and GPU don&#x27;t seem to be so different subjectively. Both are smooth.<p>The apps are vastly better on iOS, even the ones that are on both platforms e.g. one cannot insert rows in Excel for WP 7 or add annotations in Kindle. 
Support seems better for Apple, as Lumia 800 and 900 customers did not get WP8, while the older iPhone 4 will get iOS 7!",1373620335

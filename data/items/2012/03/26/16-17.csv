I landed on Code Complete a couple years after devouring The Pragmatic Programmer (and requiring my developers to read it), and generally found some good ideas of varying quality buried on mountains of text. I think most of it is right, but after having some experience in the field, it seemed it was targeting all audiences at once, from the newbie to intermediate programmer but also to organizations, managers, and others related to code. It's hard to make a book that's to the point if the book lacks focus.<p>That said, I've still used it for my research ... although I can often find other sources that say things better, CC2 has made a good starting point for ideas on how to present ideas about code.",1332781174

But can't anyone do that with anything helpful?<p>There are lots of texts on rising above worldly pleasures, and some are very good. I'm a particular fan of Ekhart Tolle's work, and I enjoyed the Tibetan Book of Living and Dying... The Tao of Pooh, and the Te of Piglet got me through a difficult adolescence.<p>As with any idea, though, simplifying it too far tends to lose important subtleties. The mental austerity mentioned in the original post is likely to strike a resonant chord with many men who wished they had better self-control, and who wished they were acting with more general agency in their life. Men are complete suckers for certain ideals of manhood, certain archetypes that are well presented. If this is something that interests you, I can strongly recommend the books Iron John by Robert Bly, King Warrior Magician Lover by Robert Moore, and the excellent Way of The Superior Man by David Deida.<p>I find this quote by Alan Watts particularly poignant, and perhaps an antidote to the original post:<p>""We thought of life by analogy with a journey, a pilgrimage, which had a serious purpose at the end and the thing was to get to that end, success or whatever it is, maybe heaven after you’re dead. But we missed the point the whole way along. It was a musical thing and you were supposed to sing or to dance while the music was being played.""

Thanks very much.<p>> <i>No, although I'm not quite sure how to argue because I don't understand the assumptions leading to this question. An economic 'bubble' is, generalized, a sociological phenomenon where people ascribe an unrealistic value (as in, real value) to a good (the 'irrational exuberance'), leading to a bidding war fueled by the prospect that this value will continue to rise. Then at some point, it becomes clear that the good is overvalued, and the people who at that point own the goods are left hanging, much like musical chairs. If they borrowed to pay for the goods, they're double screwed because now they can't pay on their debts, the effects of which can then ripple through the economy. Bubbles don't come from too much wealth being concentrated in one hand.</i><p>So if the maximum price a consumer is willing to pay for a virtual good increased through un-realistic lending over a period, that could create a bubble.<p>I suppose the part of the equation that's open to 'interpretation' is the amount of money people are prepared to pay when there is no physical counterpart or cost associated with a sale.  It does seem (at least to me) that DRM tries to introduce artificial scarcity specifically to maximise that amount.<p>You're right - I was assuming that limited supply was the basis for pricing and, that not having a limited supply could upset the balance of economics.",1332780244

If the standard is only linking and not hosting, why were Napster, Kazaa, Grokster, isohunt, oink, etc. shut down? None of these were hosting content, they just provided links (or the equivalent of links).<p>The reality is that the courts have recognized that operators who should have a knowledge that the content on their network is almost completely infringing don't have a viable excuse by just saying ""we just provide links, we have nothing to do with the actual content"". See the Grokster case.<p>So, here's the question: how much of Google's index is out of copyright, and would it be reasonable to expect Google to know that they are making money off of a catalog that is almost entirely copyrighted content without any license from or compensation to the copyright owners?",1332778697

But that's how it works. If I pay a photographer to take my portrait then I am exploiting as well as enriching him, it's a 2 way street of trading things the other person wants. In an unequal relationship such as between the developed and developing world then sometimes the exploitation can seem a bit much compared to the level of enrichment. However, at present there is no known better way to enrich the developing world. In the short term it may seem like it's only exploitation but in the long run the overwhelming likelihood is that it pulls people out of poverty. And this has been true not just in recent times in the countries I've listed, and others, but also farther back in countries like Japan and the US.<p>However, I should make clear to differentiate trade from other kinds of work. It is very possible to make use of labor in the 3rd world without enriching the people there. There are certainly a good number of examples from the history of colonialism where that was the case.

An economic 'bubble' is, generalized, a sociological phenomenon where people ascribe an unrealistic value (as in, <i>real</i> value) to a good (the 'irrational exuberance'), leading to a bidding war fueled by the prospect that this value will continue to rise. Then at some point, it becomes clear that the good is overvalued, and the people who at that point own the goods are left hanging, much like musical chairs. If they borrowed to pay for the goods, they're double screwed because now they can't pay on their debts, the effects of which can then ripple through the economy.

If this was an example of how to write an error API, I wouldn't care (I probably wouldn't read it either).  But it's a discussion about how C/C++ is written by presumably talented authors, and by inference how other people should write code.  And the code sucks, sorry.

There's no major win that I can offer for being clever, just for being more willing to focus on unpleasantness.<p>Or am I kidding myself?

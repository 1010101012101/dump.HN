- Different cell signal piggyback depending on where you&#x27;re located.
- 30 day cell tower location tracking / SMS storage / phone call storage -- so in the worst case scenario you&#x27;ve got 30 days of conversation / messages stored.<p>If an entity wanted to track YOU, they&#x27;d have to do voice analysis of every call in the country / region, look for specific writing patterns / keywords in your sms messages, and then try to match things up (this would be really difficult, even with lots of information to go from).<p>Anyhow, it&#x27;s definitely not a perfect solution, but one that really helps protect privacy.",1370624204

For instance, if the antibiotic kills a million bacteria but doesnt kill five that are resistant, at their incredible multiplication ratebacteria divide every 20 to 30 minutesafter 15 hours there will be 5 million descendants of those five, all of them resistant to the antibiotic.Some bacteria carry antibiotic resistance genes that can be passed to other species of bacteria.<p>These transferable genes often carry resistance to many antibiotics.<p>Staphylococcus aureus is a common germ that normally lives on your skin, but can gain entry to the body and cause abscesses, bone infections, pneumonia or infection of the heart valves. In the 1940s virtually all strains of S. aureus were susceptible to penicillin. Today, more than 90% of S. aureus strains are resistant to penicillin and many other antibiotics that were once effective against these bacteria.&quot;</i>[0]<p><i>&quot;One alternative, at least for some types of bacteria, is vaccination. Since Hib vaccines were introduced, the number of new cases of invasive Hib infectionsboth drug-sensitive and resistantin infants and children in the U.S. has decreased by 99%.&quot;</i>[0]<p>So yes, vaccines and antibiotics are different, but are meant to address the same things. From this most of the what we have seen so far has come from resistance to antibiotics, where vacancies have helping to address that void in some cases that didn&#x27;t turn out to be accidental inoculation.<p><i>No vaccine is 100% effective; no vaccine is 100% safe. As with any drug, there are risks and side effects with vaccines, although serious side effects are mostly rare. However, there is a much higher standard of safety expected of preventive vaccines than for drugs because:<p>Vaccines are generally given to many people most of whom are healthy. People tolerate far less risk from Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines than the antibiotics used to treat the diseases it causes, for example.<p>Many vaccines are given to children at the ages when developmental and other problems are being recognized for the first time. Because something happened at about the same time does not mean that one caused the other.  (See Cause or Coincidence)
Some vaccines are mandated by state legislatures in order to protect the health and welfare of the public. Some people think that this violates their civil rights, however.&quot;</i>[1]<p><i>&quot;Perception of risk depends on peoples experiences and knowledge. A person who experienced an adverse event after vaccinationor thinks that they know someone who didwill perceive vaccines as riskier than a person who has not. Conversely, one who has survived a vaccine-preventable diseaseor a physician who has treated that diseasewill likely be an advocate for vaccines.<p>Although concerns about vaccine safety are validand necessarywe must carefully examine each claim about the risks of immunizations&quot;</i>[1]<p>Taking the middle road on these issues is more productive than outright dismissal and becoming enraged, because it acknowledges some truth the individuals experiences/opinions or w/e that might be contrary to someone elses.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.immunizationinfo.org/issues/general/vaccines-and-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.immunizationinfo.org/issues/general/vaccines-and-...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.immunizationinfo.org/issues/general/vaccine-misinformation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.immunizationinfo.org/issues/general/vaccine-misin...</a>",1370623400

About 92% of DNS resolvers honour the TTL setting for the NS records from the leaf-node child-zones (e.g. the NS records you control as the owner of a domain). If your domain is reasonably popular, then that caching can help you outlast a problem with your TLDs name-servers. 2 days is a pretty common number for a cache lifetime.<p>Unfortunately for the 8% of resolvers that honour the TTL in the parent domain, you have less control. In this case for .io, the parent-zone NS ttls are just one hour;<p><pre><code>  ;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
  nic.io.	3600	IN	NS	ns1.communitydns.net.
  nic.io.	3600	IN	NS	b.nic.ac.

  nic.io.	3600	IN	NS	dns01.cdns.net.
  nic.io.	3600	IN	NS	b.nic.io.
</code></pre>
which I think is relatively short by TLD standards.<p>Another important thing to consider is that the TLD you choose for your domain itself isn&#x27;t the only TLD that your domain resolution may depend upon. Resolution also depends on all of the domains of your nameservers resolving too. Route 53 assigns every hosted zone 4 nameservers from 4 different TLDs, e.g.;<p><pre><code>  example.info.	  172800  IN	NS      ns-1834.awsdns-37.co.uk.
  example.info.	  172800  IN	NS	ns-22.awsdns-02.com.
  example.info.	  172800  IN	NS	ns-912.awsdns-50.net.
  example.info.	  172800  IN	NS	ns-1233.awsdns-26.org.
</code></pre>
So that if any one of those TLDs has a problem it does not cause a resolution failure for your zone. Some other providers do this too, and it&#x27;s also something you could set up yourself.<p>Full-disclosure: Route 53 engineer here.",1370622937

Non-US citizens do make up 95% of the world&#x27;s population, and they use Google etc. too.<p>Most European governments seem to recognise that the contents of &#x27;human rights&#x27; documents, if they&#x27;re to mean anything, should apply to, well, humans, not just the citizens of those countries. (Hence e.g. the ECHR blocking the deportation of illegal immigrants if they might be tortured in their home countries). It seems to be mostly just the US that has this strange idea that, despite one of its founding documents talking about &#x27;all men being created equal&#x27; and &#x27;inalienable rights&#x27;, those rights shouldn&#x27;t apply to non-US citizens.",1370622791

You are free to disagree that privacy in some meaningful sense is not a human right, but the very fact that so many other rights (both legal and human) are easily compromised when it is not present is a strong hurdle to overcome, should you wish to make that argument.<p>As an example, you have the right to criticize your employer (freedom of speech). For obvious reasons, this right is best exercised in private, where the employer cannot overhear the conversation. If the employer operated a massive surveilance network that recorded your supposedly private conversations, you could then suffer punitive consequences and be denied career opportunities merely for voicing an opinion.<p>You have a legal right to an attorney, but that right is only useful because your discussions with your attorney are confidential. Without that privacy, the whole value of the right simply evaporates.<p>My view is that the right to privacy is such an obvious prerequisite for most, if not all, of our legal rights to have any value that it shouldn&#x27;t need to be explicitly detailed in the Constitution or in any specific law. Furthermore, the world the Founders lived in was a world in which privacy was easy to safeguard, and the few obvious ways to violate it (e.g. unreasonable searches and seizures) were addressed by the Bill of Rights.",1370622579

This is a promise that no corporation can reasonably be expected to keep, if they fall under the jurisdiction of any institution greater then themselves (Like the US government).

5839778,comment,5838749,5839114,0,0,grellas,,,"The question is not so much whether you vote (most people will) but what you vote for.<p>The U.S. system of government is deeply rooted in an English common law and constitutional framework. In its U.S. variant, it became a constitutional republic, with the broad idea being that power within the government is divided by design so as to help prevent its abuse. That means a federal system premised on the legal principle that governmental power resides by default elsewhere than with the centralized authority - meaning, the federal authority is strictly limited to the powers <i>expressly</i> granted to it by the constitution, as implemented through three branches of government (executive, legislative, judicial) that check and balance each other even with respect to the limited power resident within that federal authority. Any power not expressly granted to the federal authority belongs to the states and to the people. On top of it all, the very notion of government as a compact derived from the foundational principle that it is the individual, not the state, that has inalienable rights that cannot be impaired by any government, no matter how benign its stated motives or noble its stated goals. All in all, this began as a bottom-up system with a tremendous respect for the rights of the individual and a tremendous distrust for the power of the state.<p>While that was the theory, the practice did not often match and major faults such as the slave system and the legally sanctioned taking of lands from the &quot;pagan&quot; residents who preceded the European migrants led to many convulsions by which, in time, the federal authority itself - which had often been the cause of the abuses - came to be seen as the cure for the problems and therefore came to be seen as an authority that should be given broad, largely unchecked, and very vague grants of power with which to accomplish its newly-defined goals. Couple this with the move from a formerly isolationist America (Monroe Doctrine, etc.) to one that saw its role in the world as that of an exporter of democracy and defender of a democratic system of government around the globe, and you perforce have a massive further expansion of centralized authority via the build up of a massive military, in contrast to the time of George Washington where even the very idea of having a standing army was <i>hugely</i> controversial and defense was handled mostly by loosely formed militias organized by the colonies and then the states.<p>And so, two-plus centuries later, you have a system in which modern conservatives ask for virtually unlimited authority by which to achieve largely military aims and by which modern liberals ask for virtually unlimited authority by which to achieve social aims. With that massive build up of federal power, we all wake up one day and find that the central government has become rather full of itself, arrogant, and unaccountable, with those in charge - of either of the major parties - now quite comfortable with the idea that the rights of the individual are far subservient to those of the state, at least as seen by those in charge. And we all wonder how this happened.<p>I see this as a system that is wildly out of control in its expansionist aims at the expense of the individual and, given the historical arc, don&#x27;t hold out a lot of hope that the problem can be reversed unless people&#x27;s thinking changes significantly.<p>Yes, by all means vote, but do vote with discernment and with a sharp eye to those who would protect the rights of the individual and not based on the cliches of the day regarding the modern political parties. Maybe that will in time help to turn it around. In any case, that is how I see it.",1370621791

But I think that&#x27;s not the only effect that comes out of counting the votes. It&#x27;s the one place where voters actually lay their cards on the table, or rather cast their votes in the ballot box. Votes are not a limitless resource to voters, unlike words or even opinion polls, and it is an important form of communication to other voters in the next election.<p>This is where gaming the voting system hurts democracy. Simply voting for the biggest bloc that is not your vision of pure evil is short-sighted, and causes the voters lose their independence - important for a voting system to arrive at an optimum result [1], and it also destroys the only credible method of communicating the lack of confidence in the system to each other [2]. Everybody knowing that everybody else knows that everybody have lost faith in the main blocs is not sufficient to create real change, but it certainly is necessary.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://youtu.be/3-son3EJTrU?t=8m13s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/3-son3EJTrU?t=8m13s</a>",1370620902

Programmers for 6502 and derivatives might be a nasty bunch of sadists that love to do weird stuff to save cycles, but even there there are lots and lots of common patterns that often &quot;happened&quot; just because people learned from the same sources, or because it made sense, or because conventions appeared.<p>I never had a NES, but I had a C64, and the 6502 code wrote there seemed nasty to translate on the surface, with lots and lots of self-modification, for example. But in the end most of the self modification was specific looping patterns because the 6502 can only index 256 values, and so many loops involved writing addresses into the looping code, iterate 256 times, increase the most significant byte directly in the code and see if you&#x27;d reached the end, and jump back to iterate 256 times.<p>Most of this &quot;nasty&quot; stuff is relatively well known by now and much of it is relatively regular and easy to detect.",1370620823

317455,comment,317186,317251,0,0,iigs,,,"Honestly I find discussing this topic (regulating forum karma) pretty interesting. Granted, articles that are toned to imply someone's whining about being downmodded are kind of frustrating, but I don't think the overall idea is any less ""relevant to hackers"" than any number of other things that are accepted here.<p>The various approaches to karma, when well applied, have the ability to mitigate some pretty challenging social problems (trolling, etc). Math applied to meatspace issues seems like a geeky topic with the power to make a real difference in peoples lives.

317451,comment,317376,317447,0,0,silencio,,,"Hmm, it's been a while, and I only have a dismantled bot right now sitting on my desk as a paperweight..<p>I'm not sure I actually did anything with the propeller chips, but at Defcon last month I saw a project by Kingpin that interested me (it's NSFW but the website is at <a href=""http://www.bsodomizer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bsodomizer.com/</a> , having to do with displaying a BSOD/goatse via a hardware-based vga passthrough device) that I might use it for as a joke on friends.<p>The javelin and basic stamp ones I used with the board of education (that's what they called it I think?), the BoE bot kit. Mostly messed around with that and one of the bluetooth accessories to navigate around (it's probably a lot simpler than you're thinking it is). At some point I had the brilliant idea that I could use my then-Pocket PC to control it, but that didn't go anywhere. I wonder if my now-iPhone could handle that..<p>Depending on your wants, I'm not entirely convinced parallax products would be right for you. The arduino boards look cheaper and I bet they're a lot simpler to program. I about wanted to rip my hair out dealing with the BASIC stamp from parallax since I couldn't stand the language.<p>edit: I might note my friends and family were way more impressed with the tank treads I got (a lot more stable than the wheels) than the bluetooth. still they thought it was cute I mounted a small iSight and a long firewire cable to watch them in another room. iSight wasn't sending video to the bot itself, not enough bandwidth. Although I do think parallax sells cameras that could.",1222580421

Lots of extras you could add on like GPS and bluetooth (for $ of course).<p>I've really wanted to check out the Arduino boards, but no time, so I couldn't give you any sort of comparison I'm afraid.

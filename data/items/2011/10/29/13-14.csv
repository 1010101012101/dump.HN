3171871,comment,3170766,3171466,17,0,michaelochurch,,,"It's actually pretty hard to get on to the most interesting projects in large companies. Your first project is a roll of the dice, and you usually have to do well on that first one to get an upgrade on your second.<p>Yes, there's cutting-edge work going on at Fortune 500 tech companies. It's about 5% of the workload, and it's competitive to get onto these projects. You're competing against PhDs who have been with the company for 10+ years, have major internal accomplishments to their name, and are objectively more qualified than most of us are.<p>This doesn't mean you shouldn't try. There are other benefits to working at these large companies (high salaries, good benefits, and work that, even if unglamorous, is a part of something successful people care about). I do think, however, that the idea that a 25-year-old can walk into Intel and Oracle and expect to be allocated to cutting-edge work because of raw talent, is patently absurd.<p>Most large software companies have 6 <i>de facto</i> tiers which may not correspond to job titles: Freshman, Junior, Senior, Lead, Senior Lead, and Fellow. The type of work you get depends largely on this tier:<p>Freshman: low-impact but ""fun"" projects, ""bait"" work designed to ease you into the company. This is what people get straight out of school.<p>Junior: mid-priority but grungy projects, maintenance of others' architectures. Keep in mind adverse selection: the good architects generally want to assist in the maintenance load for their creations, while the bad ones tend to run like hell.<p>Senior: mid-priority but more interesting and autonomous projects. Opportunities for junior-level IC (individual contribution) on high-priority projects. This is where most people are expected to plateau.<p>Lead: leadership roles on low- and mid-priority projects, plus encouragement toward IC on high-priority work. Good point from which to move into middle management if one hits a technical plateau.<p>Senior Lead: leadership roles on mid- and high-priority projects, plus <i>expectation</i> of IC on high-priority work. Fun but low-priority work is generally not accepted (it won't get you fired, but you'll stop advancing and your peers will think you're wasting your time.) Most SL are trying to get into lower-upper management (yes, large companies have a <i>de facto</i> lower-upper, mid-upper, and upper-upper management) because so few people make it to the next technical tier.<p>Fellow: complete autonomy, high degree of influence, implicit trust. Ability to flit between high-priority and low-priority projects based on what one wants to do.<p>To get interesting <i>technical</i> work <i>and</i> enough income to raise children in NYC or SF without an awful commute, you generally need to make it into the Fellow tier, which is much harder than moving into management. At Lead, you have enough autonomy and status to take on whatever project you want, but having real influence (or high income) requires going higher, and going higher requires spending a substantial portion of your time (40+ hpw) on grungy work because that's what Senior Leads do.<p>The bitchiest tiers are Junior and Senior Lead. Juniors have something to lose (3-4 years' career investment) and are skilled enough to take the worst of the work (middling priority maintenance, both unglamorous and underappreciated). Senior Leads are the one you see on-call at 11:30pm despite having two kids. And if you think <i>working</i> on a mid-priority, grungy project is bad, imagine what it's like to <i>manage</i> that project and have to deal with people quitting, transferring, or getting fired at a rate of 2-3/year.",1319896679

Why should kids get special treatment?<p>Um, because on earth at least, it's a common practice, even encouraged to give kids special treatment. You don't need a fishing license until you're 16, ""kids ride free"", etc.<p>They'll have plenty of time to become the kind of bitter adult who will think ""being shut down by the police is a good learning experience"" later.",1319896664

Typically a graduate student in the US does many things (from teaching to building a lab's basic equipment), and gets paid very little. I would not have a problem if a grad student claims that she did enough work for the money she is paid and her ""discoveries"" are the outcome of things she has done in her spare time. She is expected to publish of course, but there is already a remedy for not publishing: You cannot get a job in academia, and your advisor will not get further funding.<p>The funding provides the raw materials and the equipment in addition to the grad students' salary, so it is not unreasonable for the funding agency to require some open access to the outcome of the project. But this has to be said in advance, so people can decide whether to live on a low salary for many years while doing highly qualified work. If you want full access to my findings, so I would not be accumulating intellectual capital during my grad student years, then I would like a decent salary.",1319896004

I'm half-black and I've avoided such programs and clubs to avoid being labeled.<p>This is part of a larger issue: ""black"" is not a culture. What we call ""black culture"" is more like US-poor-uneducated-black-ghetto-post-slavery-culture.<p>So, if you happen to be black and aren't poor and aren't living in a ghetto, you don't really identify strongly with what most people call ""black culture"".<p>This means that successful, main-stream blacks (speaking of Canada, here) are dis-inclined to live with or be particularly helpful to struggling blacks. Compound this with other cultural divides like high religiosity of uneducated blacks vs. lower religiosity of educated people in general, and there really is a sense of ""those losers are embarrassing us.""<p>Contrast this to other minority groups that have strong cultural ties. If Jews are shunned in a country, they tend to set up their own parallel social structures. Chinese help Chinese, etc.<p>Kenyans help Kenyans, and Somalis help Somalis, but blacks (in general) don't really help blacks, because ""black"" is not a well-defined cultural group.

It's true enough, perhaps, that it's not usually the most important thing to emphasize on a resume, especially if you're doing simple CRUD apps, but nevertheless programming languages and their implementations are varied and complex.<p>Yes, you can become productive in a new language after 6 months of using it, but most people will still have a long way to go before they can claim a reasonably high level of proficiency, especially if there's significant dissonance between the languages.  Going from Java (or most languages, really) to Python isn't going to be too difficult, but a lot of that is because Python is a very easy language to get started with.  But even with Python it will probably be a lot longer before you really understand some of its less obvious features, pitfalls, performance profile, and are comfortable writing idiomatic code.

It's not about how much math you know or what data structures you use. It's how you get along with the guys (and gals) you're doing the work for. You want people who are smart enough to understand that what you're doing is important, but humble enough not to think of what you do as ""grunt work"" that they could do just as well, and decent enough not to try to ""trap"" you or to browbeat you into doing as much work for as little as possible.<p>I'm also not a fan of the ""hostage employer"" situation.

Should they not describe themselves as Surgeons?<p>Edit:<p>Are accountants high status?  I'm not sure.   They are generally regarded as making a fair bit of money but they are boring.   Probably a bit more high status than a programmer, perhaps.   But I wouldn't suggest to my accountant friends that they stop selling themselves as experts at accounting.<p>And anyways, high status = social status, and how is that relevant to any of your points?  Social status is mostly useful for when you're trying to get laid (because that's mostly when you are trying to impress people) or prove something to your parents. We, as programmers, still get paid very well and are valued by many many companies.<p>The lack ""high status"" thing in comparison to doctors and lawyers is just because:<p>A) Laywers and doctors generally make more money.   A lot of lawyers and doctors make over 200K.   Programmers, not so much.<p>B) Laywers and doctors are almost certainly better educated than programmers.  This education is validates a person in lots of ways, in that you are automatically learned about a variety of topics with which to converse with at parties, and that you are smart enough not only to perform as a lawyer/doctor but to achieve the level of education necessary to do so (unlike programming, where you only need to be good at your job and not necessarily good at 6+ years of higher ed).<p>C) The laywer and doctor professions have been around longer and are therefore safer.   Doctors are the most ancient and historically valuable professions.  Laywers, not nearly as much so, but for the past few hundred years they have emerged as a staple profession.  I like law a lot but I would devalue lawyers over doctors a bunch.<p>D) It's harder to become a lawyer/doctor than a programmer, so it's a bigger achievement.<p>E) The jobs generally require more social skills than working with computers.<p>Programmers will probably never be a high status job because of the above reasons.   But that doesn't really affect your argument, which is describing how you should sell yourself to potential employers.<p>I'd like to reiterate that I'd prefer to well rounded people who are good at programming and specifically good at our tech stack.  That's the ideal.  Take classic ASP.NET programmer and tell him to write a complex Ruby on Rails project and watch him flounder for months no matter how good he was at ASP.NET.  There's just a lot to learn.

Unless the presence of an additional icon <i>is</i> significant complexity, and there are some <i>inherent</i> complexity in letting the user have root permissions.  Of course, 3rd parties applications could crash, but that is already the case.<p>Choice: to some extent, it <i>is</i> about privacy:Apple knows exactly what Apps you purchase.  Anyway, I recommend regulation.  First, the owner of any device whatsoever should be allowed to do whatever he wants with it, provided it wasn't illegal in the first place.  We should also allow reverse engineering (doing it as well as publishing the results), even when it involves the discovery of ""protections"" such as cryptographic keys.<p>General-purpose computer system (which may include the OS) should be subjected to a more drastic regulation: as soon as there is any way to add or change functionality (mere firmware bug-fixes don't count), then the end user should be allowed and given the means to do it, at no additional cost, with no artificial restriction.  Among other things, that would outlaw the monopoly that the App store currently enjoy over non jail-broken iPhones, and the restrictions Blizzard put over the creation of user-made maps for Starcraft 2 (they host the maps, and have discretion to delete them if they don't like it).  Note: I don't mean to outlaw proprietary programs and OSes.  But a program that is a tiny bit open should be at least that open to the end user.<p>The privacy side of things is more complicated, but boils down to one thing: private shenanigans should be kept private, end of story.  E-mail is private.  Chatting is private (even in a chat room with 10 or so people).  Visiting a web site is private (between you and the web site owner).  Restricted publications (""friends only"") probably should be considered private as well.  Servers who host private shenanigans should not be allowed to:  log them, look at them (even if it is ""just a machine""), aggregate them (except maybe in a <i>reliably</i> anonymous way, which is very hard to do).  Well, you see the trend.  Note that GMail, Facebook, and probably Blogger, in their current form, should totally be outlawed (heck, it applies to nearly all mail providers out there).<p>Note that privacy violations aren't less serious if they are performed by machines only.

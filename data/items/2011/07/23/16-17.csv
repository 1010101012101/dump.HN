2797260,comment,2797016,2797160,5,0,pessimizer,,,"He's talking about the smallest and simplest of global variables in that quote, hence:<p>""it's completely doable to write [Pac-Man] in a purely functional style. The dependencies can be worked out; the data flow isn't really that bad. It still may be a messy endeavor, with lots of little bits of data to keep track of, and selectively moving parts out of the purely functional world will result in more manageable code. Now the obvious target is either the state of Pac-Man himself or the ghosts, but those are part of the core data flow of the program. Make those globally accessible and modifiable and all of a sudden a large part of the code has shifted from imperative to functional...and that wasn't the goal.""<p>meaning that trying to make Pac-Man or ghosts into pieces of mutable state will result in them being manipulated entirely by being passed between functions, an even more functionally tangled program (in terms of less being able do some modifications to it as easily as could be done in a similar imperative program.)<p>Instead he's suggesting adding tiny self-managed globals for little values that truly are global (used almost everywhere) but aren't constant. Basically segregating tiny pieces of mutable state into their own little cubbyholes in order to simplify the logic.<p>Or at least that's how I'm reading it.",1311440310

Erlang is a great language, one that I've used to great effect and enjoyed very much, but <i>Erlang is really bad at representing rich type relations</i>. The author is absolutely right that records are a painful substitute for dictionaries (a construct he reached for naturally because Erlang is a dynamic language).<p>He tried to implement it in Erlang's curious and somewhat isolated pseudo-functional rigid-actor paradigm. People have been making games and game-like demos in Haskell and OCaml for quite some time now (OCaml especially seems like very good fit). Erlang is a beautiful tool designed to solve one very specific set of problems. In its domain, it is nearly unrivaled. Outside of its domain, it is lackluster and limiting. It's only recently that modern functional programming techniques like monads and a cheap lambda syntax have started to make their way into Erlang (see Erlando: <a href=""http://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2011/05/17/can-you-hear-the-drums-erlando/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2011/05/17/can-you-hear-the-dru...</a>), so it should be no surprise that someone writing in 2008 found a lot of awkward edges.<p>Am I wrong? I quickly scanned every linked article (and their follow-ups) and didn't see a single mention of anything but Erlang, including an all-too-common digression into using tuples as a dynamic substitute for algebraic data types.<p> I can't help but feel like people assume most Haskell and OCaml programmers are chronic masturbators; making constructs like Monads and Functors because they just love category theory instead of the reality; building a functional pattern language on the same order as what Gamma, Helm, Johnson and Vlissides captured for OO programming.",1311439877

Currently, we are using launchrock as well and we've stagnated at 36 sign ups as we are trying to get to 100. We haven't spent a penny on marketing but I feel we have hit a wall. I know that the soft launch is supposed to test and validate our business idea but I feel it isn't doing it justice, not by far. Especially with the limited amount of words you have to use. On the otherhand, I also understand the overall goal, it's to test without spending too much on programmers and developers and build something that no one wants to use. We are conducting surveys as well, which I feel are a better means of gauging if you have the right audience and validating your assumptions. However, I'm torn. I can see both sides of the argument. We started the soft launch march and it's about 5 months and running. They say the idea validation phase typically is about 5 to 7 months. But I feel strongly that even though we have stagnated in signups it doesn't mean that our startup idea is going to flop. In fact I feel very strongly in it's success.

The document model provides a foundation for synchronization and conflict detection that the relational model cannot. Specially it becomes very challenging in the relational model to sync a subset of data to each device, while allowing updates to data on any node, regardless of that node's network connection status. That is, with MVCC documents, you can push the partition tolerance of a system much further than with the relational, or even key/value models.",1311437269

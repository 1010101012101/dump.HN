I kinda think that my attitude would scare off anyone that might buy us.  I mean, to save time, I've actually come up with a formula for how much money I'd want;  some lump sum dependent on the size of my company, plus another large sum for every year they want me to work for them, plus another (smaller) sum for every year they want me to avoid competing with them.<p>I dono.  This was mostly to save time;  I was hit with two courtships within a relatively short period, and felt I was spending too much effort on it, but eh... I dono.

4498370,comment,4497461,4498133,1,0,ten_fingers,,,"If my project is successful, I will be a billionaire, many times over.  I have no desire to do that, and really don't want the down side of being that wealthy, and didn't try to pick a project that would make so darned much money, but that's just the way my project looks.<p>I picked a project using my Steps 1 and 2.  So, in Step 1 I picked a big unsolved problem, one that nearly every Internet user, desktop to mobile, wants to have solved and that so far is at best poorly solved.  Then I executed my Step 2 and drew from my background in pure and applied math, had some new ideas, wrote out some new theorems and proofs, as my education taught me very well how to do, and then wrote the corresponding software.<p>At this point what is left to do is not very much quite routine Web site construction and some initial data collection.  The rest of the software is ready for at least initial production.  I've written successful production software before and for this project had no desire to write 'prototype' software.<p>But what's crucial about my project is the research, just the research, or Step 2 in my post.  All the rest is routine.<p>The main business risk is, will users like my solution.  Why is there a question?  Mostly because the UI and UX are different.  The UI is much easier to use than anything in, say, Office, but there is still a little for users to do.<p>Can the solution 'scale'?  Apparently.  From how my software works, my software timings, and some fairly simple estimating, it appears that my software could serve the world from just 2000 square feet of standard rack space in a room of, say, 20,000 square feet.  So, my software is relatively efficient.  The needed scaling techniques are just the simplest ones -- lots of parallelism and redundancy and processing mostly read only data with good locality of reference.<p>For 'needing' Paul, really I'm not trying:  I've never applied to a YC 'class' and wouldn't want to be part of one.  E.g., I don't have a Mac laptop!  And I'm building on Microsoft instead of Linux.  And I'm writing in Visual Basic .NET instead of C#!  So, my software writing doesn't 'fit in' with the YC or HN 'norms'!  And, more importantly, I'm not writing just demo or prototype software.  Also, I'm a one-person effort:  As founder, I insist on knowing all the early software, and the way for me do to that is just to write it.  Besides, I enjoy writing software.<p>The 'business idea', the research, and the corresponding software were all fast, fun, and easy for me.  But learning enough about .NET and SQL Server administration has been a self inflicted root canal procedure bottleneck -- that maybe by now I'm mostly through.<p>When I get some revenue or equity funding, for more obscure details about Microsoft's software, e.g., when I get to be a big uses of Windows Server and SQL Server, I will just pick up a phone, call a Microsoft expert, and pay.  My patience working through MSDN Web pages is drawing to a close.  Similarly for boxes I get from Cisco.<p>So far I am 100% owner.  Some venture funding would have helped me a little mostly just because I could have called Microsoft instead of worked through thousands of MSDN Web pages.  Also a LOT of venture funding would have let me hire people for all the routine software.  Net, so far being 100% owner has likely been for the best.<p>But in the future there may be a role for some venture funding.  But it looks like the 'window' will be short:  By the time I qualify for such funding, I should be close to no longer needing or willing to accept it.<p>But YC doesn't really do venture funding.  So, I would not be looking to YC for venture funding.  So, my post was not to try to get YC funding.<p>Instead my post was to try to help Paul with the struggles in project evaluation in his essay.  Also, since SV has similar struggles, I was writing to help SV.  If someone in SV wants to discuss venture funding soon, then okay, but I doubt they will.<p>For SV funding my project, from all I can tell there will be no problem if and only if my project is nearly far enough along that I no longer need or will accept funding!<p>My guess, from contacts with VCs I have had, is that to fund my project now, VCs would have to evaluate my research, which they won't do and would have a tough time doing, and then violate some rules from their limited partners.<p>So, really my post was to tell PG, YC, SV, VCs, and the LPs that for the few ""big wins"" they want, they should learn to evaluate research and, then, should do that.<p>Of course, the SV answer, should they ever actually think that far, would be, if the rest of the software is just a little, routine Web site construction, then that is not too much to ask before looking for equity funding.  My response would be, okay, but then you risk trying to get on my airplane after it has already left the ground.<p>Net, then, my post was really to try to shock SV enough to get them to pay enough attention that maybe I could do them some good on one of their worst problems and not really to get funding for my project.<p>But I should be worth about $500 million:  I helped start FedEx and saved it twice.  My offer letter said I'd get stock.  Later Fred Smith told me, with Mike Basch, that the amount would be $500,000, and that would be worth ballpark $500 million now.  That FedEx wouldn't do what they promised in my offer letter is my loss but their shame.  Ah, what the heck:  If my project works, then I'll be worth more than Fred Smith anyway.",1347252785

4498363,comment,4498016,4498158,4,0,substack,,,"No. If anything, it will probably just get even more fragmented before the situation gets better. As we understand the features and architectures of package management systems better it becomes even easier to write package managers. This is a good thing long-term because we can more thoroughly explore the solution space before settling on a few ""winners"". However, at the same time package repositories are fundamentally a network effects problem because packages depend upon other packages, so the repository with the most packages offers the most benefit for each additional package because new packages can build on everything that already exists instead of bundling that functionality themselves.<p>The reason why I am skeptical of new entrants into the javascript package management arena is that there is already a package manager with over 14k packages and a vibrant community that is producing packages at a very high rate: npm. npm might not be the best package manager as-is for browser development, but tools like browserify (disclaimer: I wrote browserify), ender, or many others can let your browser code use much of the value that has already been created for npm, even though npm is primarily about node.js packages. A surprising number of modules written for node will just work in tools like browserify.<p>Any upstart package systems would be wise to have a clear and simple path for unlocking the value created in the node community because there is too much value being created in npm to ignore. Whether that path involves adding fields to the package.json, tools to bridge the gap between package repositories, fancy in-browser trickery or compile steps remains an open question but it would be really pointless to require people to publish their modules that they've already put on npm to buy in to yet another package system, especially since there seems to be a new package manager every month lately.",1347252724

The magic of consciousness is quickly giving way to the research of neuroscience. So, why are you injecting an unfalsifiable philosophy -- which, by the way, is indistinguishable from religion -- into a scientific discussion?<p>To respond directly to your hypothetical apple, there are so many myriad ways of testing the existence or not-existence of a thing that hand-waving science away as agreement-by-consensus is premature (and wrong). Your hypothetical crazy dude could try immersing his apple in water and see if there is displacement; he could try burning it, measuring the light of the flame using a spectrometer, ask others to burn apples in the same way, and compare the output; he could attempt to infect it with insect larvae; he could attempt to power a small device with it; and so on. Science is not merely a matter of consensus, it is a matter of ever-rigorous testing.<p>Or, to put it another way: the closest thing that scientists have found so far to a ""consensus"" reality is relativity, <i>and they found a way to test and verify it</i>. If scientists can come up with a way to test whether or not time itself actually speeds up or slows down according to frame of reference, don't you think they could come up with a way to test for the existence of a magic invisible apple?<p>To get back to the article, I have to defer to Descartes: I think, therefore I am. And, I have thought about such things as MRI machines that verify the consciousness of the beings around me; their brains, the existence of their consciousnesses, is no longer a magical thing to me. I suppose it is possible that I am an element of some kind of incredible extra-dimensional simulation, but that's a very boring thing to imagine, because it doesn't in any way affect who I am or what I will do, or have done.<p>And besides, I think that one day scientists will be able to test that, too.<p>edit: here, I read the WP article you linked more thoroughly, so I'll just reference it back: I believe I would fall into the reductive physicalist camp, where p-zombies are impossible by definition. Furthermore, I think that the relatively recent work done in neuroscience -- work more recent than the idea of p-zombies, I would point out -- provides strong support for reductive physicalism.",1347252478

4498344,comment,4497778,4498236,1,0,ken,,,"As to #1, there's no reason to believe we're the first or only type of simulation.  There could well be some life that said ""hey, we've been running these simulations of our world for a while, but what if we tried making <i>carbon</i>-based life forms for fun?"".  I imagine that would happen a lot: I don't see everybody doing exactly the same type of thing on their computers today for fun, nor can I imagine any reason people running life sims would be any different.  All I know is that (if I can trust my memory) I'm in a relatively stable physical environment.  When you can simulate a lifetime in an hour on commodity hardware, there's going to be a lot of people trying crazy stuff just to see if it ends up being stable.<p>As to #2, I'm not sure I agree.  We've got lots of computer environments ourselves that aren't very lifelike at all, from Conway's Life to Sim-(fill-in-the-blank) to World of Warcraft to extremely specialized (and non-entertaining) environments.  To some extent, that's because we don't have the processing power to simulate real life, but even with infinite processing power, I would guess that most simulations would not be perfectly lifelike.  There are more lifelike simulations available today, but I don't think they're a majority.<p>For #3, yes, but maybe you're assuming the main purpose of simulation would be for experiments, and therefore that they're similar to the real world.  From what I've seen of my world, the most common use of computers is entertainment, and for this, being different from reality (either a little or a lot) is very important.  Research will have human brains-in-a-computer first, but a decade or two later the Playstation 7 will have a lot more of them.  It's like asking: you're a master-level chess computer, who are you?

But the implication of that assumption is that YC is picking startups at random, and that their filtering process is totally useless!<p>This sort of math comes up all the time whenever there's a screening process.  Imagine that you're hiring for a large tech company, you currently hire 1% of applicants, and you find that among the employees hired, there is no correlation between your interview scores and the employee's eventual job performance.  Can you conclude that your interviewing is useless?  Should you ramp up hires so you get more workforce of equal quality?<p>Well, maybe.  Because there are a bunch of possible hypotheses that could give this result.  Perhaps your interview process is designed to weed out false positives more than false negatives, so it's accurate to the 99th percentile, but then gives no discriminatory power.  (Many IQ tests are like this; they're highly correlated with life outcomes up until an IQ of about 140, but beyond that they break down entirely and there's often an <i>inverse</i> correlation with income, happiness, etc. past that).  Or perhaps your applicant pool is bimodal: 1% come from other employers and are fully qualified, while 99% are the same jobseekers that every other company rejects.  Or perhaps your interview process is broken, and you would do better to find a new one.  Or perhaps your interview process is okay, but a number of well-qualified applicants are not even applying to your company.<p>Which of these is correct?  <i>You can't know</i> without randomly sampling the population that was rejected and making an estimate of their quality.  This is why all decent scientific experiments have a control, and why financial models get backtested on data that was not part of the training set.  Even then, there're lots of things that can go wrong in experiment design, and lots of different ways to interpret data that don't necessarily mean ""Fund 10x more startups.""",1347251909

This decline has resulted from various factors. For example, the Social Security Act was amended in 1960 to make individuals under 50 years of age eligible for disability payments.""<p>I have never heard a comprehensive reason for the 60 year decline. It is possible that there is no one reason for the 60 years of decline. Each decade there are obvious reasons for the decline during that decade. For instance, the mechanization of agriculture during the 1950s and 1960s caused many jobs to be lost, especially among African Americans, and many of the people who lost their jobs were never able to find new ones (it can be tough to find a new career if you are 40 years old and have little education).<p>The loss of the textile industry added more to the decline.<p>I have not heard a theory about the long-term nature of the decline. Possibly the demographic shift after 1964 (the end of BabyBoom in the English speaking countries) add up to one generation losing their jobs mid-life and the next generation simply being smaller than the previous one? I am not sure. I've never seen that argument made.<p>Of course, for context, all of this is set off against the dramatic rise in the participation of women in the economy, a trend that peaked for most female demographics in 2000.<p>Since 2000 there has been a general decline in nearly all demographics.<p>The USA used to be unusual (for most of the century before 2000) in that it put a very high percentage of its adults to work (relative to Europe). However, since 2000, Europeans nations have seen an uptick in labor participation and the USA has seen a downtick, so the USA rate of participation in the economy is now closer to the norm for developed countries.<p>Here are the World Bank numbers for men and women in all countries:<p><a href=""http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.MA.ZS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.MA.ZS</a><p><a href=""http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.FE.ZS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.FE.ZS</a><p>(These numbers are interesting but I am curious if the same definition of ""work"" is used in all countries. In the female rankings, the USA is at 58% whereas Uganda is at 76%. I do not believe there are any nations on Earth where 76% of the females engage in the monetary economy. I'm guessing then that some non-monetary work is being counted in Uganda, but not in the USA.)",1347251307

You also don't get the ability to render to multiple targets at once (critical for performant deferred shading).<p>3) There's significant 'extension lag' as it isn't as simple as just implementing an extension on one chip and coding for that; it has to hit a certain level of penetration before it'll be ratified for inclusion in WebGL, then it has to be made safe and implemented.<p>Those are the core things holding WebGL performance back (IMO), excluding other browser bits that may get in the way, which aren't relevant to this discussion directly.

You must be able to predict events from a theory and you must be able to reproduce them.  But there's a third, implied tenet that most people forget about: anyone performing the experiment <i>must</i> come to a consensus on the results of the experiment.<p>For me, ""experience"" is easy -- it's the most ""real"" thing in my reality.  Vision, hearing, taste, smell?  Those could all be faked some day with advanced enough neural manipulation.<p>Let me attempt to clarify.<p>Suppose you have a hypothetical person who sees an apple floating everywhere in front of him.  He tells everyone that he sees this apple, but everyone else says ""No, you're crazy.  There is no apple there.""  So he takes a photograph of the apple.  He prints it out and says ""Look!  Right here in this photograph is the apple!""  Again, everyone says ""I see no apple.""  He can consistently, predictably, see this apple.  He decides to even paint exactly what he sees.  And when he looks at his painting, he sees an apple, but everyone else sees empty sky.<p>Is this person crazy?  Well, if science is determined by consensus (which it is), then yes, the majority of people would say that he is crazy.  But now instead of just this one guy with an apple, let's say that <i>everyone</i> sees a piece of fruit in front of them.  But it's a different type of fruit for each person.  And they all try to tell each other that there is clearly, obviously, unmistakably a fruit floating <i>right there</i> in front of them, but everyone thinks everyone else is crazy because they can't see other people's fruit -- only their own.<p>So eventually, they decide to just forget about the fruit.  Maybe it's not actually real if everyone else can't see it?  (Would a person in a computer simulation see this fruit?)  And so, despite everyone obviously having their own fruit hanging right in front of them, they have all decided to say that there is instead no such thing as floating fruit, since no one can come to a consensus about everyone else's fruit existing.<p>So there you go.

4498276,comment,4496694,4498141,2,0,mc32,,,"Good question.  I'm not sure.  Maybe it's economics, or maybe a combination of economics and zoning.  The one area in SF which got the 'stamp of approval' for that vision, is the China Basin/Mission Bay area.  Those tend to be 6 to 15 floor developments.  I think that's a good direction.  It's not super tall but also does not despoil land with awful low-rise ininspired developments with the collapse-prone first floors (the ones with 'garages' on the first floors).<p>On the economic side, I think cities prefer single family devs because they can levy more taxes (as they do it per acre, I think).  I don't see why they don't tax by livable (inhabitable) space and land, that way they can compensate for the greater density in required services.<p>Anyway, I've begun reading Jane Jacobs's ""The Death and Life of Great American Cities""[1].  It provides interesting insight into the suburbanization of America (and other places, of course, but she looks at the American side of it) and its impact on quality of life and how it may be time to rethink the suburbanization and revitalize cities to make the inner cores actual livable places, not just places where people drive in for work.  It's an old tome, but it's still very relevant today.<p>W:re Soviet style (and even section 8 in the US and Council Estates in the UK) the planners were kind of utilitarian and naive.  They more or less saw them as solutions for housing people as if they were storing objects.  Little in the way of allowances for human nature.  The plans were a bit too abstract.  For example, let's say they thought it'd be nice to have a community area.  They'd afford a room somewhere in a building, but put little thought on where might be optimum or how people might use it and have equally easy access to it.  So they might end up being dingy unused areas which might just get defaced or used by low level criminals.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Death-Life-Great-American-Cities/dp/067974195X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Death-Life-Great-American-Cities/dp/06...</a>",1347250592

But, the value in particular cases is astoundingly high, totally blows away nearly everything else.  What is crucial, then, as I explained very clearly, is EVALUATING the research.  Then what the ""value"" is in most cases is irrelevant.  Instead, what is relevant and crucial is the value after good results from a careful evaluation.<p>I didn't suggest investing in research and only suggested evaluating research that has already been done.<p>The US DoD has a fantastic track record both in evaluating projects to do research and in evaluating research already done.<p>The US research universities are also good at evaluating projects to do research and also research already done.  Believe me, in technical fields, the US research community is quite good at evaluating both research proposals and completed research.<p>The information technology part of Silicon Valley won't even attempt to evaluate research even that is already done.<p>Does Silicon Valley get a lot of project proposals with such research?  Likely not.  But, as PG's essay explained, so far Silicon Valley nearly never gets project proposals for projects that are ""big wins"" and that SV can tell with good accuracy are ""big wins"" early on.<p>So, since, as in PG's essay, SV is struggling, especially in project evaluation and refuses to evaluate research, I mentioned, as in my Step 2, that research can yield powerful solutions to important problems from my Step 1 and that the US DoD does well in evaluating research.  So do many other parts of our economy, e.g., essentially all of aerospace and huge fractions of all the parts of our economy involved with challenging engineering, and in these cases the evaluations are for high financial ROI.<p>In simplest terms, the ROI averaged across Sand Hill Road and Winter Street sucks; as PG's essay explained early project evaluations are shot in the dark; research can provide powerful solutions for important problems; research really can be evaluated with good accuracy; but SV refuses to evaluate research.  As PG's essay explained, to get SV's returns up takes only a tiny number of ""big wins""; well, the US DoD has done well evaluating ""big wins"" with high accuracy for over 70 years.

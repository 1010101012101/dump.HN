13310,comment,13177,13177,0,0,cwilbur,,,"The UI for the project I pitched to YC.  It's one of the two hard interesting problems in the project, and it's the one that has the most effect on the success or failure of the project.  <p>(There's another hard interesting problem, but it's the sort of thing that can be tweaked and tuned.)<p>I'm not working on it at this moment because I'm at my day job looking busy, and I don't want to do any concrete work on that project here because of IP issues.  (Any work I do off company time is not theirs, and I have that in writing; any work I do on company time is theirs.  One of the advantages of working for a very corporate boss is that ""company time"" is defined as 9 am to 5 pm.) <p>I'm not working on it in code right now in general because it's still percolating in my backbrain while I am picking off a few of the more straightforward problems to get myself going.  And because it's big and scary, and code seems more permanent than sketches.",1176737043

13308,comment,13140,13155,0,0,cwilbur,,,"$500 for incorporation is a very low figure for some states.  If I remember right, the cost of incorporation as an LLC in Massachusetts (which is what I was researching at the time, because that's where I am) runs about $1000 between what you end up owing the state and what you end up owing the lawyer; incorporating as an LLC in any other state means you need to register as a foreign corporation with the state if you intend to do business in that state (in MA:  lease property as a corporation, pay salaries as a corporation, own property as a corporation), which in Massachusetts runs about $1000 between what you end up owing the state and what you end up owing the lawyer.<p>Other states may be more lenient on when you need to register as a foreign corporation or cost less to incorporate or register as a foreign corporation.  Also, for some startup models, it can make sense to incorporate in Delaware when you start development and then worry about the whole foreign-corporation thing when it's time to start hiring employees rather than adding partners.",1176736615

This guy has set back the whole course to the very beginning, because now everything needs to be rewritten.  He's a jerk.<p>No one's impressed by his sophomore-level introductory data structures and algo classes.<p>And because he posted his code to the public, I have the following comments: his code is poorly commented and kind of crappy.  I'm further bothered by the fact that he's a senior-to-be and hasn't done anything substantial yet.  Where's the kernel, 1337 freedom of information defender?",1244746761

The lectures are far more convenient in an online form since I can watch them at any time, pause them, rewind them, jump around the slides.  Occasionally, I wish that I could be able to ask questions, but I know that I can always email the prof. separately or involve the entire class by posting a question to a newsgroup.  Newsgroups (and forums), by the way, are great in this setup.<p>Unfortunately, my experiences in working on a project (pretty much for every class) leave a lot to be desired.  Working remotely with others can be really difficult due to schedule conflicts and lack of face-to-face communication.  Skype-ing  is amazingly helpful, but is no way close to sitting down with your teammates in a study room and brainstorming/hacking.  Long silences while thinking becomes awkward when you can't see other's body language.  I suppose video chat could help here, but I still think the teamwork experience is really lost when this kind of study is completely online.",1244746281

That doesn't leave them secure: it leaves them screwed. The problem that SSL is solving (and that applications are failing to solve) is hard.<p>If you can establish relationships between members of your protocol, you can rely on <i>continuity</i> for security. Continuity is what SSH uses. It's easier than <i>authority</i>, and it's sane to recommend that people take advantage of it when possible.<p>But when your users will constantly be enrolling new participants into your system, continuity becomes a huge design risk, just like how everyone used to lose their SSH keys to sniffers at Usenix Security.",1244746149

I guess I shouldn't gripe about having to spend a few dollars to get a ready-made stack as long as it's the stack I'd want (which would be Ubuntu based). Also, why do I have to have phpMyAdmin or phpPgAdmin?  That means that I have a walking security vulnerability on my server as well as having to have PHP on my box even if I'm not using it.<p>There's no information about high availability IP failover situations.  Not important for a lot of people, but still.<p>No Amex acceptance?  My company only gives us Amex charge cards.  If I recommend this, it would mean putting it on my personal card and filing for reimbursements each month.  Not what I want to do.<p>Location?  Slicehost is St Louis and now Dallas-Ft Worth via Rackspace's data center.  It's nice to know.  Linode even lets you choose where which can be neat, if not that functional for many.<p>Why should I go with a new company when Linode and Slicehost are so well established with a long track record?  No great answer.<p>No backups yet. It's a huge selling point for my IT director on Slicehost and Linode has it in beta now.<p>--<p>Well, that was my impression browsing the site.  It looks really slick, but is there a reason to cause me to change?  prgmr.com offers significantly cheaper prices which gives me some reason (even if they have drawbacks).  That's really where I am.  There's no big reason to choose Webbynode over alternative providers because I'm comfortable installing my own stack.  But there might be lots of people who would want that ease.<p>Looks slick.  Looks like great work done.  Looks like it will be good for people, but not what I need.  Good luck!

It's complex because the problem of establishing a trusted channel between two unrelated parties is complex. Simpler protocols with the same constraints have failed.<p>You should be clearer with your recommendation. If you can relax the constraint that the protocol has to work between strangers, then SSL offers functionality you don't need, and the actual interface to SSL has moving parts that might hurt you.<p>Most people who build crypto can't relax that constraint, even if they think they can. We've beat several schemes that relied on pre-distributed public keys because of the out-of-band channels that wound up getting grafted on to bring new members into the group.<p>Finally, verifying a certificate chain <i>isn't</i> hard.

To me, Facebook seems like a waste of time apart from hooking up with a few older colleagues. Once I hook up with them, I can find other methods to stay in touch (IM, Email, etc)",1211320683

Some people benefit from transfer payments, but much less than they think, and on balance nearly everyone loses.  To paraphrase David Friedman, suppose the government takes a penny from each of 100 people, and dumps 50 cents on one lucky winner (that's you)---and then repeats the process 100 times.  Everyone feels like they're getting a good deal, but you're still 50 cents poorer.<p>Sum up the total cost of increased prices due to taxation and your personal lifetime tax burden and it's not nearly as clear-cut that you come out ahead with public schools.  Add to that the distorting effect of school monopolies on incentives and quality (virtually all public school teachers are in the bottom half academically, etc.) and you've got a shaky argument for government education, even for your case.  I'd bet that even you would have been better off if schools were provided on the market.",1211320089

If I leave my computer unattended for a while, I could expect to come back and find 10 or so error messages to close.<p>Other than this specific problem to my situation, Hardy seems to run fine, and in my opinion better than Gutsy.  Sometimes I feel as though people tend to make these overblown issues in blogs so they have something controversial to drive traffic to their sites.  These issues are small qualms that should be brought up in Ubuntu development forums, not in a blog article that disregards the OS as a whole because of some annoyances of a power user.  To be ready for the mass usage, it must be easy to install, have all of the hardware recognized, and have its users easily begin to work as though they previously have.  I have had three friends who I would consider to have no computer knowledge other than regular internet usage install the system and get it up and running just from the cd's I gave them, no other input from me.  If these people can do it and successfully get work done, I would consider it ready.  These are issues that do not apply to 95 percent of computer users.",1211318747

195319,comment,195085,195085,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"Huge beefs here:<p>1. To suggest taxing the rich at a higher rate is the sole reason for a drop in GDP is simply ludicrous. Being that government spending is a part of the GDP equation, it's much too complex to attribute to a single cause. For example, given that the public's appetite for taxing the rich would increase in hard times, it would also stand to reason that governments are reducing spending concurrently, and that is the reason for the stagnation.<p>2. The implicit suggestion that GDP increases are inherently good and GDP decreases are inherently bad is outdated. You could get a GDP increase by dropping a nuke on LA. The US doesn't even use GDP to measure economic health anymore, but rather GNP.<p>3. I would love to see a graph that uses the total net revenue as an adjusted dollar amount, and leaves the GDP equation out of it. I'm pretty sure the results would be rather different.",1211317629

I noticed that at least in web industry before Web 2.0, web designers were treated pretty badly by most management teams because they think designers just need to type in some HTML code/cut and paste some photoshop and site is done. What they don't understand is a good designer has to put himself/herself into users' shoes and experiences it when they make design choice and a bad choice will kill the site.<p>I am actually happy that at least now when you meet a management team that ignores the importance of design, you can raise the popularity of good design such as iPod, iPhone as counter point to persuade them that a good design helps sales.

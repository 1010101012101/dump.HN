Here is the clou: Everything is preprocessed and stored in a mysql-db and solr just &quot;caches&quot; everything. Its some kind of the flattened mysql schema. So I have a combination of a relational db and all the benefits with the huge bonus of the speed and reliability of solr in between. I started of with just a MySQL db, but real-time scoring is really a pain in the &quot;back&quot; with mysql and I couldn&#x27;t figure a nice way to do it. On the other hand, if you expand a story, you see that the comments/upvotes from the sources are fetched, because joins like that are no possible in solr (read: I couldn&#x27;t find a way to do it).<p>So, all the information is preprocessed at index time and solr is basically a text-blob spread across multiple fields, yes.",1427640940

What you&#x27;re describing seems like a really simple application, but even so, with dependency management, a router and the PSR autoloader it&#x27;s much, much easier.<p>Of course, choosing another language (Python, Ruby, whatever) will likely mean choosing a framework and the package manager for that language, but with PHP you have to decide whether or not to use package management or a framework on your own. The minimum viable product version of this as I see it can be done within a single PHP file, so it could be argued that the extra complexity isn&#x27;t strictly necessary.<p>If you&#x27;re working in Windows, Xampp[1] makes it very easy to set up a local server and test PHP applications on your own machine.<p>[0]<a href=""https://getcomposer.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://getcomposer.org/</a><p>[1]<a href=""https://www.apachefriends.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.apachefriends.org/</a>",1427640932

Their current infrastructure is more than sufficient to do that both from a technical perspective in blocking just those projects rather than the entire GitHub domain, and from a man power perspective (tens of thousands of people employed to monitor the web for &#x27;objectionable&#x27; content).<p>If the government was really interested in knocking material they find objectionable off the internet through a DDoS then thanks to the GFW they already have a big list of sites and content they don&#x27;t like and they could take the total GitHub DDoS traffic and proportion it among the top however many sites they don&#x27;t like and bring them down far more easily than bringing down GitHub, and with far less people caring about it.<p>P.S.

9285007,comment,9283688,9283688,0,0,mwcampbell,,,"I&#x27;m ambivalent about unikernels.<p>On the one hand, I applaud the effort to simplify the software stack and promote the use of a safe language all the way down.<p>On the other hand, I wonder if running lots of small OS kernels on a hypervisor is the best way to do this. Might it be better to simply run each application as a process on a conventional OS kernel, perhaps with containers for isolation? This post from Brendan Gregg argues pretty convincingly that virtualization imposes a substantial performance penalty:<p><a href=""http://dtrace.org/blogs/brendan/2013/01/11/virtualization-performance-zones-kvm-xen/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dtrace.org/blogs/brendan/2013/01/11/virtualization-pe...</a><p>I understand that a key premise of the unikernel approach is that the millions of lines of C code in a conventional OS kernel like Linux are a problem. But in any real Xen deployment I&#x27;m aware of, Linux is running in dom0 anyway. So why not take Xen out of the picture and run each application as a process in a container on Linux, using raw sockets so you can still implement the TCP/IP stack in OCaml? For deployments on Amazon, I guess the unikernel approach has the advantage that you&#x27;re running on top of Xen anyway, so you&#x27;re eliminating a layer. But for running on one&#x27;s own servers or an ARM-based device like the Cubieboard2, it seems to me that Xen is just complicating things.<p>I guess one benefit of Mirage&#x27;s use of the OCaml module system is that we can experiment with multiple deployment approaches and use whichever one works best in practice. So there&#x27;s nothing stopping me from running a Mirage application on Linux with raw sockets rather than as a Xen unikernel.",1427640817

Property values are even rising in what were once the most entrenched slums, like East New York.<p>Meanwhile, the inner suburbs are beginning to decay as middle class professionals no longer move there to raise families. Low income residents displaced from the inner city are being pushed into these areas where rent is low - but still not saving money because they have to buy a car and pay for gas just to get groceries, and if they take transit to work it&#x27;s now the 3-10x more expensive commuter rail rather than the affordable subway.<p>The outer suburbs where McMansions dominate are still thriving, but a few years ago I drove around the middle ring suburb where my dad grew up. In his childhood and even in mine it had been a solidly middle class Levittown clone. Tidy homes and yards, well-kept strip malls, and all. Now it&#x27;s a textbook example of suburban decay. Entire blocks of houses that desperately need paint jobs and repairs. Deserted parking lots in strip malls with half the storefronts empty and the pavement cracked so badly a small child could get lost in the gaps. Independent businesses boarded up. Old people pushing grocery carts along nearly deserted sidewalks -- probably two or three miles each way to the supermarket. Not a pretty sight.<p>You see the same in Detroit, among other places. A suburb populated by wealthy or even middle class taxpayers can afford to keep up the infrastructure and economic engine to make it a pleasant place to live. One populated by low income people can&#x27;t -- it soon becomes unlivable. That&#x27;s going to be a conundrum for us to solve in this century. I hope we address it by building upwards and expanding public transit to make city-style living affordable again for everyone (which would also be a more efficient use of taxpayer dollars than repaving thousands of miles of roads and keeping up sprawling electric and water/sewer lines in suburbs where people wouldn&#x27;t live if they could afford the city), but fear we haven&#x27;t the political will to do so.",1427639629

So what you call a vague, dubious, and unquantified signal is actually a highly informative signal.<p>You’re only making a very short statement, so I don’t know what you personally think. However, the statement is imprecise enough that others may mistake what you mean for the following fallacy.<p>Let’s say we have two kinds of Sneetches: Those with stars and those without stars. A star is highly correlated with success taking a certain type of test that we’ll say measures “Scintillence.” I am interviewing Sneetches for a job where scintellence is also highly correlated with competence. I ask for Sneetches with five years of experience doing this job.<p>Now: Should I refuse to interview Sneetches without stars, because not having a star correlates with less success in the scintellence test, which then correlates with less competence in the job?<p>The trap that many fall into is saying that since there is a correlation in the general population of Sneetches, we can draw inferences about the Sneetches applying for this particular job. However, we are dealing with the subset of Sneetches who have already demonstrated their aptitude for the job by having five years of actual experience competently performing a job that correlates with scintellence. We are not selecting Sneetches at random from the general population, we are using a combination of self-selection (“apply for this job if you have a desire to do this job”) and external filtering (“apply for this job if you have five years of experience doing this job.”)<p>The presence or lack of a star on a Sneetch may be highly informative about their ability to do this job if we pick Sneeteches at random, but that’s not what we’re doing here, so no, it isn’t highly informative for the purpose of choosing whom to interview.<p>Summary:<p>The presence or lack of a star may be highly informative if we have no selection pressure on the sample, but when we apply other filters that are themselves correlated with the attribute that interests us, it loses its ability to inform us.",1427638986

Java, ultimately, does too, but compilation happens at runtime, which is an overhead that Go doesn’t have, so in principle Go should be faster.&quot;</i><p>Oh boy.  It pains me every time I hear this.<p>In a microbenchmark, JIT compilation increases the time to ramp up to peak performance.  Once you&#x27;re at peak performance, compilation time doesn&#x27;t matter anymore.  At that point, the JIT compiler&#x27;s drawbacks are mitigated by two distinct advantages.<p>First, the JIT has information about run-time conditions that was unavailable to the static compiler.  It&#x27;s hard to over-state how important it is to know, for example, which if-statements are highly biased, or which polymorphic calls are effectively monomorphic at run time.<p>Second, the JIT can make over-aggressive optimizations based on unverified assumptions, secure in the knowledge that when an assumption proves to be wrong, it can discard that code and re-compile another version of the same method, optimized according to the latest available information.  This is only possible if the compiler is present at run-time.<p>[These are my personal opinions, not those of my employer.]",1427638670

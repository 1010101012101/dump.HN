You then jump back to the comparison to murder and seem to say (my words) that: ""Since he's not running around and killing people he obviously understands that it's morally wrong and rational for us to agree upon not doing that sort of thing. Some people still do that nevertheless. We need laws to protect us from others""<p>Now I think the 'morally wrong' part doesn't translate to driving here. I'm not sure how to parse the rest: I'd rather agree on driving safely than on driving slower than X. Safe is hard to define for a complex thing like driving. You already rely on the common sense of other people anyway (Do they drink/do drugs and drive? Do they use their mobile/search cigarettes in the back of the car while driving? Are their tires in a good shape or flat like those of a formula 1 car? Do they reduce their speed according to the situation, not just the signs - think fog, rain, snow? Are they able to judge their own ability to drive in general - think granny w/ limited vision).<p>The speed is already variable (legally only in the downward direction right now) and you're relying on other people to notice and understand that if you're taking part in that game called traffic. The question whether it's not okay to go faster than the speed on the sign allows you to _in the right situation_ is a real one and doesn't necessarily lead to reckless driving and mayhem on the roads.<p>Edit: Erm - I agree that the line of reasoning of the original article is .. unfortunate.

3265125,comment,3264849,3264849,24,0,ekidd,,,"Scala's great, if you have a gorgeous Haskell program and you want to port it to the JVM. Unfortunately, by itself, that may be a niche market.<p>If you want a dynamic language, you have lots of great choices. If you want powerful syntactic abstractions, you have Clojure, Lisp or Racket. You can win big with any of these tools.<p>But some problems benefit from powerful <i>mathematical</i> abstractions, and that's where Haskell and Scala start to shine. For example, if you need to do Bayesian filtering, you can bury all the math in a monad, and make Bayes' rule as easy as an 'if' statement. (I've got a blog post for the curious: <a href=""http://www.randomhacks.net/articles/2007/02/22/bayes-rule-and-drug-tests"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.randomhacks.net/articles/2007/02/22/bayes-rule-an...</a> ) And when your library designs start involving generalizations of linear algebra, even Ruby-lovers may learn to appreciate a strong type system.<p>But this raises the real question: How useful is Scala if you <i>don't</i> need to do functional programming with a strong type system? Most people don't, at least today, and the jury's still out on whether it will ever be mainstream. Certainly, some smaller companies will use Scala and win big in specialized domains. But if Java hackers want to claim that Scala's an inappropriate tool for their jobs, who am I to argue? I write far more Ruby than Haskell, because I encounter lots of work that's well-suited to Ruby. (Of course, there's also Akka and a lot of other useful Scala features, which may appeal to people who don't need FP.)<p>So if Scala becomes seriously popular, I'll be delighted. But a large fraction of Scala's complexity is devoted to niche use cases, and that may make some people unhappy if they're merely looking for a ""better Java"".",1321962427

His position was that the average speed of everyone on the road should be measured, and a speed limit should be chosen that approximates how fast people naturally want to drive - thereby pulling more people into the group with the posted number.<p>You can't run into someone if they're going the same speed as you.<p>The author rightly concludes that over-ticketing people is about money, first and foremost.<p>Defense spending in the United States is $685.1 billion per year, or $2,218.98 for every person in the country.

If live locks are a problem coming from load, rather than bad interactions between components, you are likely to have a choice between (i) pessimistic, where most threads do nothing vs. (ii) optimistic, where most threads do work that gets thrown away.  In practice, optimistic tends to be faster, because it is not better to do nothing than do worthless work and the committer is working with the results of successful computations, where the locking algorithm doesn't know which computations might not work out;<p>2. Extremely hard to reason about is just how it is with threads.  I haven't done enough concurrent programming to really say, but the optimistic commit model seems to be more intuitive than the pessimistic lock mode.

I.e. don't go fast if you're not feeling safe.<p>- Granted, but then again I'm not convinced that I'm very, very evil (if you talk about being green) or wasteful (if you talk about saving money) if I go 240 and use 9l/100km if there's someone driving a Dodge Ram with 130 on the right lane. In addition I consider this a limitation of technology, that might/could/should(?) go away w/ time and incentives to the industry.<p>- Depending on the distance I'd agree. I'd argue that I'd be a lot faster on a 400-500km route, but for the ~usual~ trips it doesn't matter much.<p>On the other hand, if the argument really boils down to 'let's get reasonable fast and safe to X while saving energy and removing the individual factor of going there in different ways': Might I suggest to look into trains for that usecase?

An act is wrong because of the harm it does, not the frequency of its distribution amongst a population.  By the author's logic, murder would be ok just in case more of us did it.  You may think speeding is fine but sadly for the rest of us, your choice to speed imposes a harm on to others.<p>And regarding that harm - speed kills.  Yes, there is a strong relation between speed variance and fatalities so its be fair to argue that focusing on traffic flow & speed differentials is important.  But there is an even strong one between average speeds and fatalities. Ignoring absolute speed is misleading - especially in urban areas where the survivability of being hit at 20 vs 30 mph is an order of magnitude different.<p>And finally, 'The speed limit assumes a level of stupidity that the average person does not possess.' Again, wow. Im pretty the author doesn't go around killing people because he realises 1) its morally wrong & 2) its rational for us to all agree to not kill each other because my loss of freedom to kill is more than offset by my not having to spend my every waking moment wondering who's going to kill me.  Yet, some people still murder others.  We do need laws to protect us from the harm of others, even if we ourselves would not have engaged in that harmful behaviour anyway.",1321961466

When you have so many great people and you are challenged on an issue, it can give interesting results.<p>For instance, I am no fan of most of the changes in search (eg. Instant, Snippets) but I think that adjusting search result rankings to the ""+1"" of my circles is a big deal in long term. It makes ""+1"" an actually useful button. I now start using it as ""intelligent bookmarking"". Except if you believe in near future people will search Internet through Facebook or will not search at all, which I don't, then this little ""+1"" feature is a big leverage against Facebook.<p>Google are also challenged by Amazon with their platform, and I would be surprised if they did not prepare some thing on this side. It is just that, with Buzz and Wave, they learnt that one big company like them is not a start-up and therefore can't ""release early, fail quickly, iterate"" (as so often advocated here on HN). So we, observers, would better be patient.<p>Don't forget Chrome. It seems to me that this is an incredibly fast entrance in browser market, and really did shake things up, for the better. If Google, through its browser and mobile OS, find a way to make life much easier for <i>open</i> social network users, Facebook may have to comply.

The way to ideally go about being hired is bypassing that process - you need to know people at the place you want to work at, ideally you have worked for them already and could show your skills and that you fit in. You need someone there cheering for you, someone who can make it happen and you need to get them to want you to be there.<p>Interning is a great way of getting to that point. Working as a consultant is just as great. The idea here is to get into a position where you can show your skills to the people who can ultimately request hiring you - then the whole dreaded HR process is just a formality. Get to know people and make a name for yourself, be the ""go-to"" guy whom people come to ask. Know a lot of stuff and do good work, then you will be surprised how often you can bypass all the ridiculous HR shenanigans and the rules will be bent for you, backwards if need be. Yes it is hard work but it is productive work instead time spent on polishing your CV to the latest fads, bells and whistles.<p>And this does NOT mean you have to be extremely out-going or need to have unreal social-skills; you just need to have a ""value"", you need to be good at stuff.<p>Call it borderline-nepotism if you want but I am sorry, this is not what they tell you about being hired and it is very real and far more important than all those bells and whistles and ""tricks"" for applying... and it is all about doing a good job, having a great image and having a high value so they WANT you.

Quakerism may offer a middle way between traditional Christianity and those inclined to a more meditative spiritual life.<p>As for the ""religious"" angle, Quakers emphasise personal insight over belief.

I think it's easy to go down that street into one direction (limit the speed) but much harder to go back (go as fast as you feel safe to do). People that are used to drive w/o limit here DO have speed limits to respect (on anything that's not the Autobahn, and on more and more parts _on_ the Autobahn too). People that always had a maximum speed limit of X are not used to someone overtaking them with a relative speed difference of another times X again.<p>This is mostly a gut feeling and personal, non-scientific observation, but when I went fast on the Autobahn I tended to scan the lane to the right for cars with foreign license plates. These had an immensely increased probability to switch lanes at 120-130 km/h when I was approaching on an otherwise safe/clear/free lane with 220-230 km/h.
I write that off to experience alone: If most of the traffic flows at the same speed, maneuvers like this might be annoying but okay. Understanding the fact that, while you're going at the normal/maximum allowed speed at home, there might be legal scenarios where someone passes you with twice your current speed is one thing. Overcoming the ~subconscious~ patterns in ones driving is probably harder.<p>Short version: I'd be afraid to drive fast in a place where that is uncommon or new.",1321959757

In order here are his complaints<p>1. Scala doesn't have a rigid versioned module system 
2. The functional way of doing concurrency isn't how I like to do concurrency 
3. The scala community isn't helpful enough for me
4. The type system is too powerfull 
5. The syntax is too flexable 
6. There aren't enough tests in the compiler test suite<p>Its alot of the same thing I have seen when people try to list ""The"" problems with the language and not ""Their"" problems with the language. Technically there is only one argument that could even hold water thats about the module system .

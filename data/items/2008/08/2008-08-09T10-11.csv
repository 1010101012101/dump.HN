You need to take the laptop to coffee shops, office, home, train, see what's annoying, like glossy screens may make you crazy.  So i recommend Amazon, Costco, Target.com for returns policy<p>things that can render a laptop unusable:<p>- poor display, keyboard, or wireless card; excess fan noise or heat.<p>nice to have: fast Core 2 Duo, minimum 2G RAM, if you're doing lots of compiles, spidering (DOM tree extraction), database indexing, anyting that pegs CPU's for more than a couple minutes.<p>like everybody else, my first choices would be macbook or Macbook pro/ Vmware fusion/ Windows XP and ubuntu, or thinkpad with XP/grub/ubuntu (i don't think you can buy them with XP pre-loaded anymore).  Toshiba, Dell, HP still sell XP pre-loaded (the ""downgrade option"") Macbook is only model < $1800 that has DVI out, which makes a big difference<p>Toshiba satellites aren't bad, mine's been reliable for 3 years.  Read the amazon reviews.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=268438"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=268438</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=197182"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=197182</a>",1218279081

Because the interface I'm building is just one example of how to interact with the API. The API is better and I understand my app better.",1218278621

271590,comment,271560,271577,0,0,maryrosecook,,,"Yep, I see what you mean that most usefulness to the most people is most important.<p>However, I'm not really too worried about artists missing from the index.  I am building up the list of included artists very slowly because I only use information sources that I think provide useful recommendations.  Thus, the artists that are pulled into the index is somewhat random.  The comprehensiveness will grow over time.",1218277728

2. They ask for Lines of Code",1218276567

271584,comment,271437,271548,0,0,sl956,,,"My main point was that the ruggedness and superior build quality of Thinkpads used to have limited drawbacks: they were at worst 10 to 20% heavier than alternatives (and sometimes even lighter, like the 560 around 1995). 
Not so anymore, especially in the smaller and lighter models: the X200 (and X300) are 120% (and 70%) heavier than a R500. That's why I finally reassessed my longstanding commitments to Thinkpads. But you are right to point that it may be less of an issue for the T series than for the X series: I would probably have stuck to Thinkpads had I been looking for a 15+ inches screen.",1218276009

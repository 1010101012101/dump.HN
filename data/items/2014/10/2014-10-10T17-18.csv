8439150,comment,8437967,8437967,0,0,blueskittle,,,"Someone on reddit asked why this isn&#x27;t considered an Antitrust violation (akin to Microsoft). An anti-trust lawyer explained why, but better yet, provided more context around the merger. It appears that this will ultimately go through, given the climate of the current administration and the dynamics of the merger.<p>Here is the anti-trust lawyer&#x27;s explanation:<p><i>Antitrust lawyer here.</i><p><i>For one, we&#x27;re talking about different antitrust issues. Broadly speaking, the antitrust laws prohibit (1) concerted action that harms competition, like price fixing cartels; (2) unilateral action by a monopolist that harms competition; and (3) mergers and acquisitions that significantly diminish competition.</i><p><i>Microsoft was alleged to have used its position as a monopolist to undermine competition. That&#x27;s (2) above. Typically, monopolization entails an element of foulplay. Achieving or maintaining a monopoly through normal, reasonable business practices is not illegal.</i><p><i>Comcast and TWC are proposing to merge. That&#x27;s (3) above. When evaluating a merger, the DOJ looks at whether the companies directly compete in any markets, and whether the merger is likely to reduce competition in those markets.</i><p><i>Comcast and TWC claim that they do not directly compete. That&#x27;s true, but there&#x27;s more to the story. Comcast and TWC will point out that cable systems are &quot;natural monopolies&quot; -- it costs a lot to lay cable, and where one company has already laid cable in a given area, it enjoys a huge cost advantage over other would-be competitors, who would have to lay their own cable to compete.</i><p><i>But on the other hand, Comcast and its rivals have also done some dubious stuff in the past that has led to the current competitive landscape. For example, Comcast, TWC, and others have engaged in a number of anticompetitive deals, such as geographic market allocation and customer swapping, to create large regional monopolies. These deals themselves arguably violate the antitrust laws -- see (1) above -- and indeed are the subject of ongoing litigation. But unfortunately, the DOJ most likely would not take this background into account when evaluating the likely effect of the merger on competition.</i><p><i>So when Comcast and TWC say that the merger will not reduce competition because they do not currently compete, that is in part due to the fact that they have already agreed not to compete. It&#x27;s like two members of a price fixing cartel saying that merging would not reduce competition because, hey, they aren&#x27;t competing anyway.</i><p><i>We don&#x27;t know yet whether the DOJ will challenge the merger. The Obama DOJ has been decent in this area; they challenged the AT&T/T-Mobile merger and US Air/American Airlines merger. But neither of those cases played out -- the FCC killed AT&T/T-Mobile, and the DOJ caved once politicians began pressuring the agency to let US Air/American Airlines go through.</i><p><i>Given that Comcast is so well connected in Washington, and in light of the potential difficulties in establishing that the merger will actually reduce competition, I expect that the DOJ will approve the Comcast/TWC merger, subject to certain concessions.</i><p><i>Politics is a core issue when it comes to antitrust enforcement. In fact, I don&#x27;t think the Obama DOJ would sue Microsoft today. Clinton&#x27;s DOJ was a bit more aggressive in this area.</i><p><i>Hope this helps.</i><p><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2h87ob/eli5_why_did_the_us_government_have_no_trouble/ckqdlo5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2h87ob/e...</a>",1412963954

Then Netflix will drop Linux support.<p>It&#x27;s a shame that so many people in the OSS community have such an asymmetric and hypocritical view about paying people for their work and respecting creators&#x27; licensing intents. If I take a GPLed GitHub repo, clone it, incorporate it into my commercial closed-source app, and release without source or credit to the author in violation of the GPL, everyone gets bent out of shape. But apparently quite a few people in the community don&#x27;t extend that kind of respect to non-programmers. Only developers have rights -- artists, musicians, etc. can go suck it.<p>Just commenting on why the industry refuses to give up DRM despite the fact that it&#x27;s complicated, costly, limiting, and users hate it.

Version control feels natural there. GitHub for Windows application also helped.<p>Another, more recent example. Because of some weird reasons I ended up having to learn how the old RMI in Java worked. Oh, such a pain in the ass it is. I wasted like five to ten hours making it work because of bullshit like XML configurations, setting up servers from (Windows again) command line with magic invocations, weird security issues and dropping manifests in random places. <i>All I wanted to do is to have program A call a function in program B</i>. Things I did to get there were completely irrelevant, but took 90% of time.<p>Current example - don&#x27;t ask me to do anything in client-side MVC frameworks. The whole ecosystem around Angular, Ember and Node.js <i>feels like</i> utter bullshit to me. Again, tons of magical invocations, hundreds of megabytes downloaded, hundreds of thousand of files in project directory, all that to achieve what used to take a single <i>alert(&quot;Hello world!&quot;)</i>.<p>I know, it&#x27;s probably useful somehow to something. But I wanted to make a simple app, you told me to use Ember, and I wasted half a week and a DVD worth of disk space and I still don&#x27;t have that app.<p>So yes, I feel him. It&#x27;s not that the software or command line sucks. It&#x27;s that 90% of things he has to do are completely irrelevant to his research, and yet he can&#x27;t proceed without doing them.<p>What can we do to solve it? <i>Hide the bullshit</i>. Hide the infrastructure. Just running a program should never require touching version control. Hello world in a web framework should not require setting up test frameworks, downloading half of the Internet and selling your soul to Satan. Make basic use cases simple. Or at least, write tutorials that explain the reasons behind magic invocations and that are targeted to beginners, not people with 10 years of experience in the domain.",1412963309

8439073,comment,8437671,8438777,0,0,drostie,,,"So, the deal is that quantum computers don&#x27;t do <i>everything</i> for you. They can do <i>some</i> things faster than any classical algorithm, but they&#x27;re not known to, say, do NP-complete problems in polynomial time. (Friendly reminder: we don&#x27;t even know whether classical computers can do that or not.)<p>Supposing that you&#x27;ve got, say, three qubits which can all be 0 or 1, a classical computer can be in one of eight states 000, 001, ... 110, 111, and we can easily store one of those numbers in memory. For a quantum computer, we have to instead store 16 doubles in memory, because it is allowed to be in any state:<p><pre><code>    |S> = a0 |000> + a1 |001> + a2 |010> + ... + a7 |111>
</code></pre>
such that the complex numbers a0, a1, ... a7 square-sum to 1. In other words, for n bits you often need to store 2^n numbers.<p>There are rough-and-ready ways to get around a bit of this in simulation with a sort of &#x27;lossy compression&#x27; approach, it&#x27;s stuff like: you form the &quot;state matrix&quot; (basically, take your row-vector and form an outer-product with its conjugate transpose), diagonalize it, and keep only the eigenvectors for the largest eigenvalues. If your system is simple enough you might be able to just reduce the bulk of the calculation to &quot;what&#x27;s happening to these eigenvalues?&quot; and you can leave out any explicit further representation of the vectors themselves.<p>Now, here&#x27;s where this gets interesting: the world is quantum, especially when we&#x27;re talking about molecular chemistry. So, we have these chemicals which obey quantum mechanics and they have this huge quantum state which is cumbersome to compute with. But with a <i>quantum</i> computer, we can just <i>program</i> those rules and that behavior into the computer and <i>see what it does</i> with the physics that our classical computers can only barely simulate. So that&#x27;s why these quantum computers, when they&#x27;re doing what they&#x27;re good at, beat out our supercomputers.<p>But why can&#x27;t they beat out our supercomputers unilaterally? Because that&#x27;s just not what they do, and for the most part these 2^n complex numbers which tell us the quantum state are not directly observable.<p>Let me put it like this: at the end of the day, when you measure the |S> above in the computational basis, you will get a classical 8 bits of information and the quantum state will be destroyed: you measured, you found |010>, that is the state of the system now. Prepare millions of these and then you will find some statistics for |000> and |001> and those statistics will give you a few decimal places for |a0|, |a1|, |a2| respectively, with no information about the phase factors of the complex numbers involved. It&#x27;s not terribly enlightening of itself.<p>But then there are some generic problems, like &quot;what is the only n-bit input to this set of logic gates which makes the result bit come out 1?&quot; where you can do better. The answer to that is only n bits, but our only classical algorithm searches through all 2^n settings of those bits to find the answer. It turns out, if you can make your logic gates act their normal way on a quantum state, then you can pass one of these a-little-of-everything superpositions as input, then do a little magic to the input bits based on the resulting output bit, some &#x27;yadda yadda&#x27; about a quantum fourier transform, and poof: when you measure the bits you will, with high probability, get the bits which set the logic gates to 1. That&#x27;s with only the <i>one</i> query actually sent to the quantum versions of those logic gates. You peek inside it once and the resulting state knows enough about how it was created that you can extract out something interesting about the function.<p>So for some algorithms like factoring integers and searching for special inputs to a process, you really do get &quot;exponential speedups&quot; from quantum computers. However, those algorithms are really special-purpose stuff; quantum computers are not known to make arbitrary computations faster. They will make some specific computations, like chemistry calculations, faster.<p>With four qubits we have been able to factor the 4-bit number 15 into 3 * 5. That&#x27;s the biggest that I know we&#x27;ve built, although some companies (like D-Wave) claim that they have built bigger systems under a different model of quantum computation (and hence can&#x27;t do the factoring algorithm straightforwardly). The problem right now is that you need these big experimental apparatuses to cool, manipulate, and read out values from these quantum computers, and while you&#x27;re doing those tests the clock is ticking -- states don&#x27;t stay &#x27;coherent&#x27; for more than a fraction of a second, after which they act pretty classical. There&#x27;s just not much we can do with these systems until we get them to be always-online and stuff.<p>Finally, 1 and 2 qubits don&#x27;t really show off all of the diversity of quantum mechanics; for one thought-experiment that I like to use to show people the strangeness of quantum mechanics (&quot;Betrayal&quot;), I determined that you needed three people playing the game together, no less, to really get the paradoxical result.",1412963051

A lot of progress has been made in the field in the last few decades; however, there is a roadblock right now that no one really knows how to get around called the fermion sign problem.  If we want to simulate atoms or molecules as accurately as we can, the number of resources we require scales exponentially with the number of particles.  This is basically due to the Coulombic (electrostatic) interactions between the electrons in the atom.  Accounting for these interactions gives many materials their interesting properties, but we&#x27;ve only been able to come up with approximations for solving these systems.<p>Quantum computing would allow these systems to be solved in polynomial time.  The advantage would be enormous; in some cases, atomic simulation results would match experimental ones exactly†, and that is a very exciting notion.<p>(†glossing over a huge number of details here)",1412962022
8438986,comment,8438690,8438941,0,0,gavanwoolery,,,"With polygons, you must explicitly pass in every vertex and corresponding data (unless you use a geometry shader).  This gets huge fast - with just usually around 12 32 bit floats per vertex (position, normal, material and tex coords).  That is 48 bytes per vertex.  Not only that, but each vertex must be processed (transformed) and the resulting polygon clipped, which is usually a more or less order-dependent operation and thus not well designed for multithreading on GPUs (they do use tiling though to address this I think, but usually this means redundant calculations).<p>With voxels, positions are inherently stored, and guaranteed to have some cache locality if they are uncompressed.  Thus, GPUs are really good a chugging through large amounts of bitmaps, which is what I am doing (only rendering to bitmaps).  With teraflops of compute power now, you can do trillions of flops every second, and in my case I can render about 1-2 billion voxels per second.<p>Additionally, doing procedural generation with polygonal surfaces is much more complex (I&#x27;ve done it, I know).  Implementing stuff like voronoi patterns (used for the rocks) is trivial with voxels.  Not the case with polygons, unless you are just wrapping voxelized data.  Its the difference between evaluating a graph at every point, and calculating the graph at only the needed points.  Voxels are implicit, polygons are explicit.<p>Really, you can think of VQ like a really fancy graphing calculator (in fact, all of the structures are just an extension of superellipsoids) (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superellipsoid"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superellipsoid</a>)",1412962019

There are certain specific things it&#x27;s amazingly good at (most notably, factorizing large integers), some other things it&#x27;s quite good at (e.g., some kinds of search operation), and lots of things for which no one knows how to make quantum computers any faster than classical ones.<p>So, if you have a quantum computer, you&#x27;re probably going to want to use it for breaking RSA or similar cryptography by factorizing large numbers.<p>There are (ordinary, non-quantum) algorithms for factorizing large-ish numbers. They work pretty well for numbers of modest size. But they don&#x27;t scale well as the numbers get very large. Something like exp(log(n)^1/3 log(log(n))^2/3) to factorize a number near to n. Or, in terms of the number of bits, something like exp(b^1/3 log(b)^2/3).<p>So this works fine for numbers up to, let&#x27;s say, 200 bits on a single machine or 1000 bits for a team with a substantial network. (Note: all numbers here are kinda made up but of the right order of magnitude.)<p>With a quantum computer, you can factorize a b-bit number with something like 2b qubits, b^3 quantum gates, and a runtime that scales more manageably with b.<p>So there&#x27;s not much point in using a quantum computer until the number of qubits it has gets large enough to use for factorizing numbers bigger than you can do on your PC. Which means somewhere on the order of 100 qubits. As the number goes up, the advantage of the quantum computer over the classical computer increases. The transition from &quot;slower than your PC&quot; to &quot;faster than any classical computer that will ever be built&quot; takes place over a fairly small range of qubit-count.<p>Down with much smaller numbers of qubits, though, the quantum computer can maybe manage to find the factors of, say, 15.

Usually to assess what happens before the sales team is asked to assess the probability of closing the deal and discount the deal size by that probability. An increase of the scope (and of the total value) or of the probability to close the deal represents your metric.
It is not very scientific but could be made pretty accurate. E.g: you know the price of your product and how much you are willing to give a discount in order to close the deal. Also, even if negotiation, especially with big companies, could be unpredictable, it is usually done in steps and each steps closer means an higher chance of success. A possible sequence of steps is:
- RFI received.
- RFI answered.
- Q&A and first meeting
- Follows Up
- RFP received
- RFP answered
- First round of Q&A/meetings
- Short Listed
- Second round of Q&A/meetings
- Product demo
- Final negotiation (usually price and conditions)
This is the process for RFI, there&#x27;s a different one (and a little bit more complex) for &quot;cold calls&quot; that probably is more applicable to startups. Obviously some steps are optional and the names could changes but this is how it works.
Just a final note, though. If you are a startup in B2B avoid, at the beginning at least, big corporation as client if you can. They have a huge negotiation power, they will drive down your price like crazy and being your biggest client they will use their force to ask you a lot of extra work than the one negotiated. You will end up loosing a lot of money on the deal and also you will have little ability to follows other deals.

My suggestion also hugely reinforces Dr. Guo&#x27;s point: we&#x27;ve perhaps solved a problem by adding piles of additional tooling layers: (vagrant CLI, Vagrantfile interface, VM domain knowledge, setting up a Linux host (even as a toy environment), setting up a Linux host as a build environment, etc.)  Heck, if we&#x27;re doing it right it&#x27;d be nice to use a provisioning tool to automate the VM and build environment setup.

</code></pre>
So, you have to learn the name &quot;tar&quot;.  The option &quot;-x&quot; for extract, the option &quot;z&quot; for gzip, and the option &quot;-f&quot; for file (by the way, the &quot;f&quot; must come last, or it won&#x27;t work).  <i>What the fuck is this retarded interface?</i><p>First, why do I have to tell tar to extract the thing, since it&#x27;s obviously a compressed archive?  Why do I have to tell tar that it&#x27;s in gzip format? It can decompress it, surely it can check the compression format? And why, <i>why</i>, WHY do I have to tell it I&#x27;m processing a <i>file</i>?  It <i>KNOWS</i> it&#x27;s a freaking file!!!<p>Surely there must be an alternative, like… like…<p><pre><code>  $ decompress foo.tar.gz
</code></pre>
I personally don&#x27;t know of such alternative, and don&#x27;t use them, because I was retarded enough to learn the basic &#x27;tar&#x27; incantations by heart.  Now that I know them, I can&#x27;t summon the courage to use a decent interface instead.<p>But you see my point. Even for a simple tool such as tar, the common use case involves a cryptic incantation that shouldn&#x27;t be needed in the first place.  I&#x27;m sure many other UNIX tools are like that, I just didn&#x27;t think about critiquing their interfaces thoroughly.  Yet.<p>The core principles of the command line are very good.  The level of relatively easy automation it provide is nothing short of amazing.  This technology for the 70&#x27;s is arguably more capable than most graphical interfaces in current use.

Man pages are a great way to document every flag a program accepts, but are a terrible way for someone to figure out some simple use case for the program. Similarly, flags are named without any regard for intuitiveness (-l is liable to mean different things for any program you encounter, and the precise meanings one program decided on can be hard to remember because there is no explicit commonality with any other tool).<p>In that sense, it absolutely is a user hostile design and it involves lots of unnecessary memorization.",1412960413

I am still amazed trains are piloted but they are and that is far simpler to automate than trucks.<p>Once trucking becomes automated you will have trucks delivering at all times to warehouses, scheduling around traffic patters. Whereas humans are not necessarily best at driving at night, vision and physiological reasons, computers could drive at hours when traffic is always the lightest.",1412960400

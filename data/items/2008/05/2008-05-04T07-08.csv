180710,comment,180517,180689,0,0,phaedrus,,,"Curious.  What do you think - has Microsoft been so successful in business at least in part <i>because</i> of its insistence per Paul Allen of keeping large cash reserves, larger than most companies keep on hand?  (MiniMSFT blogger said something like, ""Why?  We're not a bank!"")<p>Or is it simply that Microsoft has held a very lucrative monopoly position for many years and just makes more money than it knows what to do with?  I.e., perhaps its habit of keeping large cash reserves are just an effect of its success and not any kind of cause of it?<p>The reason I pose the question is that I have been forming a layman's theory that in fact it is all about the cash, even as much for a huge company as it is for a small mom and pop store; that as long as a company has cash on hand it can go on, and when it runs out of cash the end is coming even if it takes years in a downhill slide.  If you take corruption as a given, I suspect that all the accoutrements of big-company strategies like pursuing growth over profitability, borrowing money to run at a loss, etc., are nothing more than smokescreen thrown up by upper management to make it look like they're doing a good job when they're really bleeding the company.  Rather than being a waste of resources, I rather wonder if keeping a large cash reserve is like a protective armor to keep a company from having to borrow at interest during rough periods.  Is this completely off the mark?",1209887315

Yahoo for some reason didn't have that, and it put the board especially at risk to hostile takeover.",1209886138

I can diagnose the patently obviously cases, but apparently I can't see the items that are subtly trollish.<p>(As a side note, I've found I have the same deficiency across all the sites I frequent).<p>edit: My motivation for asking is this:  I like and respect the people here.  I do not want to make the same mistake as last time.  As far as I can tell, the definition of a troll is heavily dependent on the community that defines it.",1209886043

Remember who would be consuming who here.  Isn't it more likely that the larger Microsoft would replace Yahoo's culture than it would be that Yahoo's culture would mollify Microsoft's?",1209885704

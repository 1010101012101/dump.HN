5351117,comment,5349900,5349915,1,0,grn,,,"I think that you confused wealth with money. pg's article you quoted makes this distinction pretty clearly:<p><i>If you want to create wealth, it will help to understand what it is. Wealth is not the same thing as money. [3] Wealth is as old as human history. Far older, in fact; ants have wealth. Money is a comparatively recent invention.</i><p><i>Wealth is the fundamental thing. Wealth is stuff we want: food, clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places, and so on. You can have wealth without having money. If you had a magic machine that could on command make you a car or cook you dinner or do your laundry, or do anything else you wanted, you wouldn't need money. Whereas if you were in the middle of Antarctica, where there is nothing to buy, it wouldn't matter how much money you had.</i><p>Later there's an example of creating wealth:<p><i>Suppose you own a beat-up old car. Instead of sitting on your butt next summer, you could spend the time restoring your car to pristine condition. In doing so you create wealth. The world is-- and you specifically are-- one pristine old car the richer. And not just in some metaphorical way. If you sell your car, you'll get more for it.</i>",1362902248

If it accurately reflects American culture is another story, but I gotta say American media is not really helping the case - as isn't Mr. Musk here.<p>That being said, I - and most of my acquaintances - still love American culture - the kind of 'just do it'(TM) attitude, shown as well by Elon here - the stunts he's pulling with three high risk industrial companies <i>at the same time</i> is pretty much unthinkable in 'the old world'. And I'm not sure, but maybe his aggressive stance, the ability to sort of indoctrinate himself with his vision, might actually be needed to push through these grand projects.

Consider photo filters: you may want to have a photo filter written in asm.js for maximum performance on browsers that support it, but degrades to a suboptimal, but usable, experience on browsers that don't support it. Likewise, consider an asm.js-compiled mobile game: you may want it to be playable on desktops too, whose browsers generally contain enough horsepower to run JS-compiled mobile games at full speed even without special support for asm.js.<p>There are plenty of use cases in which ""slower but backwards compatible"" is extremely desirable. AAA games are not everything.<p>> If you really want to support backwards compatibility, then make it a secondary target, not the primary one that you saddle yourself with for all time.<p>Again, it's not worth forcing Web developers to compile multiple binaries, when the main difference here is <i>how you parse the bytecode</i>.<p>> asm.js is competing with native, and they're starting out with an intentional disadvantage.<p>PNaCl is starting out with the same disadvantage as asm.js, modulo surface syntax. In fact, asm.js arguably has an advantage over PNaCl. Starting from the JS AST that must be constructed by every browser anyway, the asm.js verifier is a mere 1,216 lines. For comparison, LLVM's BitcodeReader is over 3,000 lines. LLVM's Verifier is over 2,000.",1362901888

I have two VPSs which both run Debian.<p>For a large company with dozens to hundreds of servers, you generally want RHEL (or SLES).  Usually you're running RHEL (or sometimes SLES) on Dell or HP servers.<p>If your servers are having stability problems (or if it is a decided company policy), you want to keep the kernel and packages up to date with all the latest security and other patches for your OS version.  You also want to keep the server firmware up to date.  So if there's a crash you can tell Red Hat and HP, or Red Hat and Dell (or Suse and HP etc.) that you're running a fully patched server with updated firmware.  Of course, you want the kernel to try to dump core before it goes down.<p>As your servers go from dozens to hundreds to thousands, you will tend to see more and more crashes.  At a company with a few servers, you might see a server crash every few weeks or months, at a company with thousands or tens of thousands of servers, you often see more than one server crash a day.  You want to look for patterns - if, say, machines with a certain host bus adapter keep crashing, and the core dump seems to point to that, it's something you want to be aware of.",1362901801

My grandparents, immigrants, landed in the new world with nearly nothing to their names.  Nothing.  They sought no handouts.  They received no handouts. They worked hard and elevated themselves from absolutely nothing to eventually owning their own small business.  This is the story of millions of immigrants who, hungry to succeed, pushed through thick and thin and made it happen.<p>A huge chunk of our population would be easy to look like sorry excuses for human being when compared to the stories most immigrants could tell you about their history in the new world.<p>Granted, we created some of these problems.  That said, the human condition is such that some of us will not act unless put into a sink-or-swim predicament.  Stories of able-bodied youngsters stuck in this alternate reality abound.  Some have even taken to YouTube to very publicly show off what they can get for free from the government and actually talk about how you can do the same.<p>Look, I recognize there are a lot of things government has gotten right.

You have never present the reasoning behind that assertion, and I did not get the same conclusion from the presentation.<p>For example, you said ""Dinosaur Planet was transformed to a StarFox game because it makes so much business sense but unsurprisingly she didn't mention this _extremely_ obvious fact."", and I show that while it wasn't explicitly said, it was a simple inferences from two other statements, to wit ""the transformation used the damsel-in-distress trope"" and ""game companies often use the damsel-in-distress trope to make more sales"".<p>This does leave the possibility that the change was done for other reasons, but I think it's reasonable to infer that the speaker knows that it makes business sense, but also believes it doesn't make good moral sense.<p>For example, you describe 'objectification' as the dictionary definition of ""To become/transform into an object"", and argued that the speaker was using ""false attribution."" I responded by pointing out that the speaker was using the definition as it's used in the philosophy of ethics, with a heritage dating even back to Kant, and that that was the appropriate definition for this presentation. I don't see where the presenter used false attribution.<p>As as for ad hominem, I realize that you do have experience in that matter. The phrase ""doing it in a overly-formal tone just to look more serious"" is ad hominem, in that it references the presenter's style, rather than the logic.<p>So please, justify your original assertions rather than making new statements.

5351045,comment,5349626,5350875,6,0,antoncohen,,,"<i>> When do you think debian strives to hard to be perfect?</i><p>The apt repo format with pools and the indexes, it's a nice idea, I see how pools can save space, but ultimately they add complexity with little in return. The deb control files, all broken up instead of a single spec file, I understand the urge to modularize, but ultimately is makes it harder to work with while adding little value. What they do with apache and nginx with mods-available, mods-enabled, sites-available, sites-enabled. Again, I understand how that could seem better, more modular, easier to manage, but ultimately in my experience it's just a pain to deal with -- they tried too hard.<p><i>> I am not sure what ""half-backed"" means but it does not matter because you are talking about Ubuntu and not Debian.</i><p>Half-baked means unfinished or not well thought out. I think Ubuntu gets this because of their strict 6 month release cycle (not the ""when it's done"" attitude Debian and Red Hat traditionally have). Also they seem to lack attention to detail when it comes to server stuff. No, Debian stable is not half-baked. But the OP specifically asked about ""Debian-derived Linux distributions"" so I included something Ubuntu specific.<p><i>> Do you think debian comes with poor documentation for new/changed features?</i><p>While I prefer Red Hat/Fedora [online] documentation, no I don't think Debian documentation is poor. Debian actually updates man pages when they make changes, unlike Ubuntu. The reason I like Red Hat documentation better is that it has a more focused voice, it comes across as official and clear. Debian documentation often comes across as personal opinions, and appears more scattered to me.<p><i>> iptables-persistent is installed on 1.17% of machines that supply popcon data[1]. Lets face it compared to pf iptables sucks, but it sucks a lot less when you use shorewall.</i><p>Ah, yes pf's syntax and features put netfilter/iptables to shame. I would much rather run pf as a network [gateway] firewall. But I also think you should have a host firewall, they are really needed in the cloud, so iptables it is. According to the popularity contest only 2.49% have shorewall, and 1.87% have ufw. I'm guessing a lot of people rolled there own with shell scripts. Which is another gripe I have. There is no default persistent firewall, to me that is crazy. iptables-persistent doesn't even support IPv6 in squeeze (current stable). It makes me feel like Debian lacks direction, no one cares enough to make it happen, there's no project manager insisting it get done because customers want it, people just do what they want.<p>I don't mean to pick on Debian, Debian is great, I just wish they'd do some things more like Red Hat :)",1362899726

It&#x27;s very simple, really: the ratio of employee&#x27;s salary to his/her total income is very likely to dwarf the ratio of the cost of the employee to the companies total costs. Hence, keeping an employee is very low-risk for the company, while getting fired is very high-risk for an individual. Even if you say &quot;it&#x27;s not working for <i>us</i>&quot;, what you really mean is &quot;I&#x27;ll slightly improve my profit margins by turning your life on it&#x27;s head!&quot;.",1415181467

8561119,comment,8557386,8560753,0,0,tracker1,,,"While I appreciate your sentiment here, the fact is there are situations where having the most bulletproof solution isn&#x27;t the best solution.<p>A perfect example are, in my mind, some of the reasons why node.js is taking off as opposed to say Java or C#...  One, is that the latter tend to follow &quot;enterprise&quot; development practices.  That is, they will follow &quot;architect&quot; tooling that implements &quot;design patterns&quot; ... the problem is that this adds its&#x27; own kinds of complexity.<p>In C# (or Java), there are frameworks and tooling that tend to follow design patterns, which is nice.  There are abstractions that allow for the use of multiple injection/ioc systems to make code more modular and testable.  Which is awesome.  It also makes code more complex, and the abstractions are often harder to follow.<p>In JavaScript, since you can replace just about anything, and even call into functions with differing contexts, this makes testing even easier.  Because if this simplicity, with a module system (like commonjs/node/npm), you can write testable code without the need for the use of interface abstractions... It becomes easier to test, write for and use.<p>There are down sides to using JS over C# etc.. but the same arguments apply to data usage.  Most &quot;NoSQL&quot; databases give up some safety, usually for big performance gains.  It really depends on the context of the data, which I think in DBA terms is often lost.  I&#x27;ve seen some horribly normalized datasets used in SQL to create &quot;flexible&quot; systems, where a NoSQL solution is a much better fit.<p>It depends on your needs.  There are times where I&#x27;d lean more towards ElasticSearch, Mongo, Redis, Couch, Cassandra, RethinkDB and others over the likes of MS-SQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, DB2, Firebird, etc.... all have advantages and disadvantages over eachother.  An embedable db abstraction is often a very good thing.  Depends on what you need.<p>I specifically added Firebird above, because I&#x27;ve used it as the core for an embedded/distributed data layer before... This was long before node.js was an option.. now, I might favor something like tfa solution, with a mongodb central db.",1415181105

My personal field of experience is set top boxes.  Typically you sell big orders to a telco.  When one of those contracts is rolling out, it&#x27;s all hands on deck.  Engineering, obviously, but also marketing and design. The problem arrives when you deliver.  The product goes out the door after a crunch, and then... crickets.<p>Marketing doesn&#x27;t have any new direction that they want to take the product - they&#x27;ve been so busy holding the big client&#x27;s hand.  Design doesn&#x27;t have any tweaks that they want made to the base system - they too have been deep in the design language of the big client, and haven&#x27;t yet started to think about where they want to go next.<p>The result is that Engineering find themselves with nothing to do, at least as directed by management.  In the better-run companies, this is the moment when the line managers start pushing out improvements to tools, cleaning up technical debt and so on.  In the less well-run companies, each engineer is left to their own devices.  Unfortunately you probably can&#x27;t do any of those technical-debt type problems. Most of them are large jobs - that&#x27;s why they weren&#x27;t done in the push to get the product out the door.  And nobody wants to waste time doing half of a non-sanctioned task, just to get dragged off to do something else when an urgent bug pops up, or marketing and design wake up from their post-crunch torpor.

Vim is very low cpu usage and I would expect that to get you pretty far. Go is very sweet here because it has a fast, and very efficient, compiler which produces fast, and very efficient, code. All of these together might extend the battery life of your laptop. I have no experimental evidence for this though :) Go also compiles to ARM pretty well as I understand.

Their social networks aren't developed/mature enough where they have to depend on other people's social network preferences. Most teens could literally leave on a whim and bring most of their friend with them. I still remember how quick the exodus from ICQ to MSN was (and nobody hated ICQ.. it just kinda happened).<p>Also when a teen tells you that they hate something because there's too much drama.. it means they fuckin' love it. They CAN leave but they don't want to because Facebook is so effective at stoking their out-of-control hormones. With Instagram in the fold this is especially true. As for why everyone else is on Facebook? Well it's because everyone else is on Facebook. And how else are you going to see pictures from your out-of-the-country relatives or creep on your high-school crush. I think Facebook has reached enough critical mass to not have to worry about becoming irrelevant for quite some time. For the record I don't use Facebook much myself, other than to keep a reminder of when everyone's birthday is.",1369421947

5764664,comment,5763832,5763995,10,0,lsc,,,">I want to start a family, and I want them to have the best life and the best opportunities available. Not to be spoiled, but simply to have a good life.<p>This... does not always work out how you think it will.<p>I'm the oldest of six.  (Divorced/remarried parents, 3 kids each).   I'm dramatically more successful than any of my siblings, adjusted for age.   According to the tests, I'm not any smarter than them;  according to in-school performance, well, I'm about the worst of the bunch, academically.<p>Now part of this was just plain luck;  I graduated from highschool in like 97-98,  and had a solid sysadmin/programming job within months.   If I had gone to college?  There's no way I would have been able to do as well looking for work in 2002.<p>But, I think a lot of it was that when I was growing up?  money wasn't a given.   I mean, my parents weren't dirt poor or anything;  they owned a house, etc...  But, I watched as they moved up from renting crappy places to buying their first house.   Clothing often came from goodwill.    They loaned me money to get a cheap car when I got out of high school, but I was expected to pay them back.    If I worked hard and got good grades and scholarships, there'd probably have been some help for college, but it certainly wasn't a given.<p>By the time my siblings came of age?  my parents were in much better shape.<p>Now, I mean, when I say I'm more successful, I mean financially, maybe they are happier, I don't know.  It's quite possible;  I certainly wouldn't call myself well-adjusted.    And certainly, that can be more important than money;  but I'm pretty much the only one here that wouldn't be in trouble if our parental safety net went away, and that's kindof a big thing, I think.<p>But, my point is?   more money does not always mean more successful children.  Children look at what you do, not what you say, so if you are optimizing for successful children, it's probably best to have them watch you /become/ successful, not watch how you act after you have become successful, and have time to enjoy the fruits of that effort.",1369421908

It's taken about 4-ish months of evenings to make a functioning prototype. Then another couple months to design the website/do user interviews/etc. Despite the flattering mentions, I still freak out a bit that not enough people will buy it when I launch.<p>2) Made a desktop app that had more of an 'interaction-first' approach, and inspired by folks behind Balsamiq.

5764604,comment,5762416,5764230,1,0,betterunix,,,"""How did digital photography, which put 140,000 people out of work and, as Yahoo's CEO correctly notes, eliminated the business of professional photography, create more jobs than it eliminated?""<p>It put 140k <i>involved in the film photography industry</i> out of work.  We <i>still</i> have professional photographers (now using digital cameras), and the demand for CCDs and technologies related to digital photography created jobs in the semiconductor industry.  The uses of digital photographs for online businesses (like Facebook) has helped to create jobs in that industry.  Many people switched to GMail because of the large amount of mail storage it offers, in part because of the space that high-resolution digital images require -- and thus many jobs at Google have resulted.  Think of all the people who had to work to expand network capacities, expand storage capacities, and the various services involved with that, to meet the demand of people who send and receive digital photos and videos.  A text-only Internet, or an Internet where the only graphics were cartoons, would not have required nearly as much capacity as today's Internet requires, nor would a cell phone network that only carries voice calls or sends text messages.<p>Digital cameras are not just film camera replacements.  A digital camera enables ways of using photos and videos that were substantially harder (or even impossible) with film.  You cannot truly believe that something like Youtube would have become popular if people did not have an easy way to record and upload videos.  You cannot believe that Facebook would have been a hit if people did not have an easy way to take their own picture.<p>""How does a shopping website, which eliminates a dozen local small businesses, create more jobs than it eliminates?""<p>Who packs the site's shipments into boxes and onto trucks?  Who builds the site's computers?  Who mines the silicon and rare earths used to make those computers?  Who maintains the communications systems that enable you to buy things online?<p>This argument is no different from stage coach drivers who complained about how railroads were killing their business.  It is the argument the Luddites made when they smashed industrial equipment.<p>""I want to believe this is all going to turn out okay, but I'm also watching private companies making record profits and the stock market shooting for the moon while unemployment numbers remain unchanged.""<p>Much like the unemployment of blacksmiths.  If people lack the skills needed for this day and age -- if they do not know how to use computers effectively or competitively -- then of course they are going to be unemployed.  The unemployment rate for programmers and computer scientists is about one-fifth that of the general population.  People need computer programmers, not film photographers or local shop keepers.<p>Look, I am all for criticizing capitalism, but your criticisms are all wrong.  You are complaining about the progress of technology.  You are complaining about the fact that I can record a video of the local cops beating up a black guy and within minutes have the rest of the world seeing what I see.  Why not instead ask this:  why, when new technology doubles the productivity of a single person, do we double our expectations of what that person can do?  If one person can do as much as two people, why do we fire half the work force, instead of halving the number of hours we expect people to work?  I am not saying this is necessarily a solution, but it is a better question to ask than, ""Where did all those Kodak jobs go?""",1369421036

It's one thing to think you have a rare disease (and is statistically very unlikely), but if you are a doctor seeing already self-selected ill subjects, wouldn't that change the probabilities significantly? I know modern medicine is quite mentally taxing, and most doctors are trained to be conservative, but maybe just emphasizing the fact that the statistics are different for the population of people seeing doctors might go a long ways to convince doctors not to automatically lump illnesses into the most common categories.<p>That, and making the tests cheaper (like all of them, virtually zero cost; who wouldn't just throw every test they can think of at a problem if the tests were dirt cheap).",1369420913

This is the first dated inscription but the positional arabic notation (with a zero like glyph) had been in use for at least 300 years earlier. If you consider other place value systems the concept of a 'separator' goes back much farther.<p>This isn't necessarily evidence that they understood zero as a number as opposed to a concept. By 1000 in Europe they used  a symbol as a placeholder that looked superficially similar to our modern glyph of zero. When explaining it, however, it was clear it was simply a placeholder that could always be omitted and was ""sometimes useful"" and was absolutely not really a number. It isn't clear that the glyph used here or in Europe was anything more than an elaborate 'dot.' It certainly didn't seem to be be transmitted as a recognizable glpyh but each culture rendered it in the way most convenient as a counting and placeholder aid.",1369420281

Things usually make more sense once you've taken a breather and focus on other things in life than ""doing a startup"". It can provide you with a new sense of perspective on your current situation (i.e. it's not as bad as you think it is).<p>Moreover, creating well executed solutions <i>is</i> a hard thing to do, period. Try adjusting your goals on what you hope to get out of your startup: not only financially but intrinsically as well. Setting the bar too high on day 1 is the same as setting yourself up for failure. Taking things one step at a time works much more motivating and allows you to iterate to your desired end-goal.<p>Also, consider reading up less about what others do. In particular, consider reading up less about other people's successes and so forth. They can easily create this feeling of ""being a failure"" for not having been able to achieve that just yet. Startups tend to fail more often than not, although I wouldn't necessarily be too comfortable to use the word ""fail"" in this context: it's often a necessary thing to learn what one did wrong and how one can improve. In that sense, you might want to take another look at your undertakings of the past few years :)",1369420229

5764443,comment,5762652,5762791,1,0,hexagonc,,,"The question is, what was your situation before you took this job?  Did you resign from a previous job in order to take your new one, or were you unemployed before this job?  If the latter, how long were you unemployed?  Since you haven't been employed at your current job for very long, like others have said, I would basically start looking for another job as a continuation of your prior job search.  Don't mention your current job on your resume unless the effective employment gap becomes unseemly.  Don't mention anything immediately to your coworkers or boss until you've already found something.<p>One of the big mistakes that many developers make is accepting a low or barely acceptable initial salary in the hopes of making up the difference with raises later.  The reality I have found, and probably many people will agree with, is that it is very hard for a non-executive/manager to make up for a small starting salary from within a company, especially with the same role.  A good salary increase for performance is 10%, but it would still take over 4 years of the maximum performance increase to reach $70K from $47K.  And that assumes that your contributions are acknowledged and you get the maximum performance increase for it. Even changing positions within the organization may not bridge the gap as much as you would like. I remember a very smart guy at a previous company that started at a low salary.  Due to his competence, he was moved/promoted to a different department that had much higher average salaries than the one he came from.  The problem was a company policy that capped salary increases when moving from one job to another at 15% of your prior salary.  This struck me and him as completely counterintuitive.  The company was willing to pay someone off the street that had much less institutional knowledge much more simply because they were new.<p>So the final question is, is $47K an acceptable salary for your area?  Did you accept it because you were desperate or because you truly thought $47K was a fair salary?  The moral of the story is that if you really feel like you deserve $70K - $90K, then the only practical way you're going to get it is by changing jobs or truly committing to your current company and getting multiple significant promotions from within.  Your mileage may vary depending on the bonus/promotion structure of your company but don't count on just doing a good job and being loyal to cut it.",1369419145

It is very cheap to purchase a smart card and card reader (~25 for a gemalto reader & a gemalto .Net smardcard) and if you're buying in medium to large quantities for a business the cost is even less.<p>This has some major security and convenience advantages over keeping keys in a file. Firstly, you can generate the keypair actually on the card so that the only device that ever has, and will ever have, the private key is the smartcard. Secondly, the key is secured by a pin and, by default, it will block the card after 3 incorrect pin attempts and after 3 incorrect attempts to unblock the card it will permanently erase the secure storage on the card. Also you can easily make use of your keypair on multiple computers, even untrusted machines, without compromising security.

5764438,comment,5763100,5763484,14,0,zackmorris,,,"Those are all very solid points towards accomplishment, but I wanted to play devil's advocate for a moment.  I'm in the same boat - started programming at 12, am 35 now with no real monetary success to speak of.  However, I've gone deeper into computers than I ever thought I would.  I could build a computer from the ground up, everything from logic gate design to mask layout to microcode and assembly language, up through the most abstract concurrent algorithms, networking, 3D, AI, you name it.  So almost everything I read now feels old hat or a reincarnation of something discovered decades ago.  People's ideas seem generally pedestrian, etc.<p>So I think perhaps it's good to take a step back and stop thinking in terms of what you should ""do"" and more in terms of what you would like your life to be like.  If the current startup scene bores you because of an endless series of negative feedback, just realize that many of us feel the same way.  The problem is very much the world's, not yours.  It's always been that way, and always will be that way, for any individual in any time period.  That's when I finally realized that no matter how hard I worked or how hard I tried, I could never achieve happiness through my accomplishments alone.  That's a bitter pill to swallow for someone who built their life around self actualization.<p>I had a bit of a midlife crisis last year and let it all go, and tried a new way of deciding what to do based on whatever presented itself.  If a problem had a smell to it, like I was halfway up Mt. Everest and had to reach the summit before I could even begin working on the crux of it, I said no to it.  If you want to try some mantras to get through the day, maybe you could try picturing how to solve a problem without doing it yourself.  Like, could you find someone to do it for you, could you do the problem after a few beers or on an island somewhere, things like that.  That's how wealthy people approach problems, so you can copy what they do and even though you won't get wealthy right away, you'll start to earn income in the form of time and feel wealthier for less effort.  Most problems don't require a superhuman effort to solve, they just require communication and teamwork and patience.  A small multiplication of your efforts through others can surpass your own ability.  Plenty of people have lived rich lives with no money to speak of.<p>Anyway, I wish I had some deep insight or miracle cure but I'm still trying to figure it out myself.  I guess, whenever I'm not sure about something, I try to ask which option will reenfranchise the most people, or is most in line with how I would like the world to be in the future, regardless of the immediate benefit to myself.  It's weird because if you start approaching the world in those terms, opportunities start falling in your lap, because people somehow sense that about others.  There is plenty of wealth in the world, maybe a quadrillion dollars or some unfathomable number, so if the game is to be part of that, it's a more effective strategy for people to share it with you of their own accord than to somehow win it from them through sport.  I guess that's why I'm starting to have more and more doubts that the startup scene can create the kind of world I want to live in, even though it's one of the best tools we've got right now.  Probably the orders of magnitude higher per capita wealth on something like Star Trek is going to come from cooperativism and automating society's basic needs so that people are free to explore further into what it means to be human.  So this musical chairs game people are playing with capital is distracting us from the infinite potential we each have inside us.  Staying in the casino too long means you never won.  Someone else did.<p>If you have kids or are responsible for someone, disregard my advice because I have absolutely no idea what to do in that situation.  It scares the crap out of me.

A company says ""we automated process X, improving quality, reducing production time, and cutting costs by consolidating the Y division"" (where Y may be the ""grunt work"" that was automated, or perhaps less direct---an industry that depended on having warm bodies doing task X).  This is considered an unambiguous win in the commercial sector because it makes the company more competitive/profitable.<p>Politicians, on the other hand, see all the people from division Y that are now unemployed and don't have marketable skills.  Depending on the industry and locality, increased competitiveness can increase revenue and local spending, keeping a neutral or positive effect on employment rate. But in general, automation is bad for politicians in places that lose jobs. Those politicians are tasked with providing incentives or otherwise stimulating the market to bring jobs back to the region. Efficiency is a second-order effect for politicians: it only matters insofar as it affects the solvency of the company or the ability to keep the local facility running.  But many industries have de-facto local monopolies (e.g., due to high cost to enter a local market) or other circumstances such that maximum efficiency for the corporation is not optimal for local politics.<p>If you want to sell a new technology to a politician, you have to show the new jobs that will grow up around the technology rather than showing the efficiency gains from replacing workers.",1369418781

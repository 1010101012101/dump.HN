2085900,comment,2085248,2085248,0,0,unoti,,,"I'm a pragmatic, ""put it in the done basket now"" kind of guy, and have argued the author's viewpoint to people over engineering things countless times.  Generally I argue against the optimization route when I feel like we're facing a choice of delivering something not optimized that pleases customers, vs having something really technically cool that's only partially finished and not delivered.  A lot of developers tend to fill all available space and time with useless engineering for some kind of street cred.<p>But there is another side of this that the author is not mentioning.  For a lot of applications, if it's not going to scale properly, then the great success the company seeks becomes its most dangerous risk.  This is because you often can't control the adoption rate of your application.<p>For many kinds of applications, once the load gets to that critical tipping point, the entire system goes into an unstoppable death spiral of doom.  The whole thing won't run. For God knows how long until you do who knows what to make it go again.  And what happens to your business during that time?<p>For some kinds of businesses, that downtime isn't too big of a deal.  But for others, it could be enough to make the customers regret they ever signed up with you.<p>Still, premature optimization is evil, I can't deny it.  I think the best solution to the quandary is to have and create tools and skills within the team such that building apps that can scale without too much danger isn't much harder than building plain apps.",1294595890

Unless you have seen it with your own eyes, you too are believing based on the words  of others.  My point isn't that we can't verify some of the things we think are true, but my point is that we usually don't.  Instead, we believe what we're taught because everyeone else around us believes.<p>We're not so different from the people at the time of Columbus that were taught the world was flat.  They didn't (most couldn't verify it), but everyone 'knew' it was true.  That had been taught it, they had books describing it, and maps showing it.  They had as much evidence as I do about mars.<p>Many people really have seen mars through telescopes, and a number of rocket scientists have built devices to go and look at it indirectly.  THOSE people KNOW mars exists.  The rest of us believe, blindly, what we are told about it.  I don't doubt mars exists in the least, only because I _choose_ to believe it exists.",1294595289

CakePHP, or Symfony, or Rails, or Django is to web applications what paint + scaffolding + tarpaulins + masking tape + ladders is to painting.<p>Yes, you can build a ladder in the programming language you like, or you can just import one (or, in many cases, not have to) with a framework.  They both still use paint, and I completely disagree with the assertion that a framework tells you where or what kind of paint to put -- it just puts you closer to the walls, and makes the application of said paint a little easier.<p>For the record, I personally consider an application framework more like a Wagner spray painter, or something more like that, but I think that's more dependent on the framework itself.  Yes, there are constraints with frameworks, but there are significant advantages to speed of development.<p>As for the whole PHP vs Python, I'm completely ignoring, since you seem to be conflating PHP vs 'application frameworks in other languages' instead of PHP vs 'another language', which is unfair at best, and ill-informed at worst.  For what it's worth, I'd put either Ruby or Python up as a general purpose language above PHP any day of the week, and PHP is the language I learned to program on (and still like, despite its unpopularity.)",1294595262

I agree with a lot of what is said here: PhD students in Europe, and especially in places like the Netherlands and Scandinavia, have it unbelievably good (not that you'd believe it if you followed the debate here, with ""PhD oversupply"" and ""temporary contract abuse"" a prominent topic; to be fair, most graduates from my program have found academic jobs both in Norway and elsewhere, though there is a tendency for people who have spent over ten years in temporary positions to call it quits). However, places like the Netherlands and Scandinavia, even if they punch above their weight in many fields, are not too big in the grand scheme of things. Again, I don't know that the situation is like in the hard sciences or in CS, but certainly in my field the fact that Europe has well-funded PhD programs and jobs does not help the pretty dire (as far as I can see) situation in the US. There are relatively few people who go on to positions in Europe after US grad school, and even fewer the other way around.",1294595135

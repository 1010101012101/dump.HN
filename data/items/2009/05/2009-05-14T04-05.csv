It even had two 720k 3.5inch disks plus an infrared keyboard.  The thing was so heavy I swear the case was made from pig iron.",1242276921

He's studying weapons and systems engineering and really loves what he's studying so I was thinking maybe a book pertaining to this subject area, but I would feel weird buying him something like a textbook. Can anyone give me some gift ideas?",1242276801

608263,comment,608120,608246,0,0,tomsaffell,,,">That's really surprising that your voice and video are getting cut up<p>It is strange. All the Flash P2P tests I have not had choppiness problems. Are you using the Speex Codec? What quality setting? I believe RTMPFP prioritizes low audio latency most highly, to prevent audio chop. Video doesn't get quite the same priority, being heavier, and less crucial in most scenarios. So video chop is a little less surprising.",1242276727

Would you recommend taking it, considering the pros and cons of its consumption? In which doses do you ingest it?<p>All this in order to make an informed decision about taking it, or not.",1242276134

Had to read that a couple of times coz it sounded too good to be true :).<p>Most consumer firewalls won't block it, but most corporate ones will. Eventually we'll implement a server-based fall-back, but that would suck in a few ways.<p>Edit: That's really surprising that your voice and video are getting cut up. It usually either works very well or just doesn't (if it's a firewall issue). thorax, can you email zhyder AT dabbleboard DOT com?<p>As for the desktop sharing, we'll be releasing the feature to allow you to choose which rectangular region to share. But we probably won't have the ability to select specific applications to share though; limitation of a browser-based solution.",1242274978

Big things (big add-ons like firebug or colorzilla) are obviously deal-makers, but the little things are big friction points.<p>For example, the main reason safari irritates me is that they don't have the bottom of the page chrome.

608234,comment,607271,607285,0,0,10ren,,,"I think it's the recent comments - their shallow attacks reduce the perceived quality of the submissions.<p>Recent comments tend not to collaborate with the article - they aren't filling in gaps, adding further instances, extending the concept; discussing where the article is clear or unclear; correct or incorrect. And they are neither respectful nor kindly. They don't build on, or with, the article to create something better.<p>Instead, comments compete with the article - they find spelling errors, logic errors, or denounce the article in a shallow, general, global and vague way, often labeling it with connotational language. They aren't trying to build value, but destroy it.<p>The only criticism I enjoy reading is what you'd get from a kind and wise mentor. If someone hates an article, I'd prefer it if they just ignored it.<p>But I can't make them do that - so, recently I've taken to ignoring the comments here, and going direct to the article to make up my own mind.",1242274270

For reasons which were never really clear to me, ""I'm an East Asian Studies major!"" was not sufficient, so my choices were either Gender Studies or The History of Jazz.<p>I will say this for required common curricula: if you only take courses which you're interested in or whose built-in intellectual biases are flattering to yours, then you're missing out on a good deal of the educational experience.<p>I will also say this against required common curricula: there were no gender studies majors in AI class.",1242274236

608226,comment,607002,607992,0,0,diego,,,"The idea is that if you own 5% of a company worth 200M and you quit, the remaining 95% ownership of the company cares enough about it that they will replace you and move on. In this scenario there is no acquisition, and you walk away without making the company lose any significant value.<p>I've seen that happen: one of the fully vested founders of the company I worked for left on a sabbatical. After six months he decided he didn't want to come back. By then all his functions had been taken over by other people. He sold some of his stock, kept the rest and went back to grad school.<p>The point is not so much the size as the fact that you can walk away more easily if you own a small fraction of a company without causing a significant drop in value.",1242274100

This is excellent.<p>I can't find anything that I wouldn't pay for-- this would help out our team if it turns out we can avoid firewall problems with the video streaming.<p>Seems like that part would be the most likely to cause issues, right?<p>I'll try it again when others on my team are awake to give it a shot.<p><i>Edit</i>:<p>Ok, tried the voice and video-- a bit worse than other services. Kept cutting out the audio and video. Had to keep re-enabling it myself to get it to work again.<p>File uploads worked well there, as did images and drawings. Good stuff, but the video and audio aren't stable enough to use for a real conference. Usually it behaves fine with most services I use, but the others kept losing my video and audio in mid-sentence.<p>Desktop sharing seemed to work (or so it said) but it's really hard to tell what part of the screen it is showing as opposed to things like GoToMeeting.",1242273919

608220,comment,608120,608208,0,0,zhyder,,,"Thanks. Regarding:<p>1. That's intentional, so the user would scroll down past the the logo and ""Signed as ..."" portion at the top. But I guess that's not a good design decision.<p>2. Sorry! Need to test more browsers. Opera has issues too btw, but Safari+Firefox+IE seem to be happy.<p>4. Agreed. It turns out it's hard to check when the firewall is really blocking UDP, so we're having the user check for it. We think we have a solution for that though, and will release that soon.<p>No word from Adobe about a commercial version of Stratus or release date for FMS4 (which is supposed to support the functionality too). Btw, Adobe's Flash Collaboration Service (formerly ""Cocomo"") is also a contender for commercial release.",1242273700

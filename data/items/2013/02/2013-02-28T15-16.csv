5299225,comment,5299009,5299009,45,0,philiphodgen,,,"Note the inherent flaw in ""by the hour"" billing:  if you want to increase your income you either must work more hours or raise your rates.  In other words, hourly billing guarantees a built-in cap to your annual income.  You have a maximum, but no minimum income.  This is a world that I do not want to live in:  a voluntary upper limit on my achievements.<p>Hourly billing is a method of setting prices by looking at the cost of the product you are selling.  In fact a customer does not care what it costs for you to deliver a product or service.  You could be delivering a product that is made of diamonds and unicorn horns.  It doesn't matter.<p>What matters is the value of your product or service to the customer.  Your job, as a business owner, is to set your price based on the customer, not based on your costs.<p>Set your price based on the value that you deliver.  Then adjust the inputs (hours of worker time, etc.) until you can deliver the value at that price.  Mercedes Benz adjusts the inputs for a C-class car until it hits the target price.  It adjusts the inputs differently for an E-class or S-class car.<p>There is a lot of information out there in the wide world about this.  It is not ""fixed pricing.""  Call it ""value pricing.""  Fixed pricing is just computing the cost of your inputs, adding a margin, and declaring a price.  Value pricing is a matter of working backwards from the customer's value desires to set the price.<p>For you math people, this is an ""area beneath the curve"" problem.<p>I'm an international tax lawyer.  I make far more money (and have happier customers) when I charge a declared price than when I bill by the hour.<p>All that being said, one of the points in the article is exactly right:  raise your prices and you will get better quality customers.<p>Go see www.verasage.com as a jumping-off point for discussions of pricing in professional service firms.  All business are alike.  Don't think that advice to an accounting firm is inapplicable to you.  It's not.  It's all ""delivery of a service to a human being in exchange for money"".",1362067177

But actually, at this small scales the wave nature of light becomes quite important, since for an object smaller than the wavelength the distortion of the light wave is damped exponentially on an scale of the wavelength. So I think the word shadow is as appropriate as silhouette, since both somehow imply light rays ( and are therefore a rather loose usage on the meaning of the words).",1362066736

It seems the author is looking at the freelance testing industry (is 'industry' the right word here?) through rose colored glasses.<p>Freelance web designers and SEOs are everywhere because you don't need any experience and often times don't even require any actual skill to do the job. All you need to know is how to repeat the whole ""Social media marketing your business reach customers user experience blah blah nonsense"" spiel and people say ""Yeah! I want to miraculously reach the top of Google for everything and make a billion online like Zuck"" and hire some dude for $300 who read ""HTML and CSS for Dummies"" last week at a Barnes and Noble. I know this because I used to be that asshole (not the business owner, the freelancer).<p>Other kinds of web/tech freelancing have very simple-to-understand values. In the minds of a lot of people who hire freelancers, Web design = Branding or Marketing = Profits. Simple. Not exactly correct, but that's the line being fed to everyone these days. Same with SEO. SEO = Rankings = $1B profit.<p>Testing is different though. I have to say however that if a company even needs to test software to begin with then they're probably playing at a higher level than the companies hiring freelance designer/devs and SEOs. Still, the value of a tester is still nebulous. You don't hear freelance testers out there drilling ""Testing will make your customers love to use your product, increase efficiency on yours and the customer's end, and save you a ton of money"" or something equally easy to market. To most businesses testing means ""we played with the app on the staging server and it worked fine for us. time to push it live"". It just comes off as an extra expense that isn't worth the investment.<p>And why is that? Because freelance testers, unlike other freelancers, have failed to create a consistent, marketable appeal to business owners (i.e. tell them why it's going to make them tons of cash) the way other freelancers have. And it's probably because those who do testing are a little more thoughtful and less about pizazz and flash than designer/developers and the nature of testing itself is kind of boring unless you're really into it yourself. Design is fun because everyone wants to be an artist. SEO is fun because people are given the idea they're in control of which keywords they'll pop up for and such. Testing? Totally boring. Some guy's gonna come in here and find bugs in our software? We can do that ourselves or just make sure to mark all the complaint emails as TODOs in Gmail.",1362066337

People value things differently for a huge number of reasons. With things with a personal appeal like music, or maybe TV/Film but I imagine less so, some people will pay more for their favourite band, others won't. That means the band is undervaluing their product to their greatest fans (good for the fans) and over valuing for their lesser fans.<p>Normally, when I download things, it's because I don't value the product at the price it's being sold, but I do still value it!
Film is a great example of this. I'll happily pay $5 to rent a great film like Django unchained, or Avatar, etc. But am I going to pay the same amount for the (boringly bad) Bourne Legacy? No. But I would still pay something to see it.. perhaps $1, maybe $2. But I can't because there is no option to do this. So instead, I would consider downloading it.<p>So what have the film company lost when I chose to pirate instead of purchase? Not $5 because I wouldn't have paid this in the first place. So they've lost $2. And what have I lost? I've had to spend some of my time hunting down and waiting for the film to download (A minor inconvenience) but that's it. So seems like the only loser is the film company.<p>For evidence, look at the most highly downloaded film of 2012 'Project X'. IMDB gives it a 6.6 rating and it sounds a bit lame but fun. Exactly the sort of film that isn't worth full price rental.<p>Or perhaps that's just how I see things..",1362066240

As far as I know, you can't ask for access to a specific repository for an account, just access to private repositories in general.<p>You could probably hack around it by creating an integration account that only has access to the repositories that you want to integrate.

But I guess doing that doesn't drive traffic from HN.<p>What Google has said is that they just want evidence a reformed spammy site has /attempted/ to remove offending links manually.<p>See Slide 16: <a href=""http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/pubcon-2012-slides/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/pubcon-2012-slides/</a><p>Note how Google wants to see evidence in the Link Disavow file that sites have TRIED to remove links manually:<p>Here's a sample of a valid file:<p><pre><code>     #example.com removed most links, but missed these

     http://spam.example.com/stuff/paid-links.html

So this whole post seems like sort of a hissy fit from the edge case of a site that a) failed to protect itself by linking out with followed links from untrusted posters and then got spammed to hell, and then b) gets offended when he reads a comment directed at sites who are trying to profit by removing links when all he really needs to do is hit delete when he gets emailed with link removal requests.<p>I agree with the comment that this is fair play or an ""ethics tax"" on people who bought links... f-em I say, since they cheated to begin with and hurt sites who played by the rules and whose content should have enjoyed better rankings and traffic than it did due to the spammers.  So whatever hell they're in now is fine by me.<p>But I also think the OP brought his problems on himself.  I ran a huge UGC site for 10 years before I sold it and sorry to say, but if you want to play forum master, you're responsible for defending your site from whatever nastiness is out there.  We expect UGC sites to have porn filters, profanity filters, troll filters, and a DMCA takedown procedure, do I don't think it's too much to think that smart webmasters will nofollow links (which is why this site got on the XRumer radar in the first place).",1362064989

5298927,comment,5298451,5298451,13,0,btilly,,,"Wow.  What are the odds?<p>Just doing quick ratios and squaring them, if the comet follows the initial projections, there are only about 230 large objects coming this close for every one that actually lands on Mars.  (And Earth gets hit with about 3.5 of these for every one that hits Mars.  Our last is estimated to be 65,957,000 +- 11,000 years  ago.)  This is literally a once in a million years near miss!<p>Of course the odds now are much higher than they normally would be.  The fact that it is on a hyperbolic orbit means that it comes from outside of the Solar System.  The density of such objects is much higher near the galactic plane than elsewhere.  However the Sun bobs up and down, spending most of its time away from the galactic plane and crossing it every 30 million years or so.  We last crossed it something like 100,000 years ago and are now heading away, so are still in a period where interstellar objects are more likely to come barreling through.  So the odds are higher than they normally are, but even if you generously account for the currently increased risk, this is still a once in a civilization near miss.<p>Of course the initial estimate may be wrong.  From the article the uncertainty is much bigger than the distance to Mars.  If the uncertainty is the stated 650,000 miles, then we've got roughly a 1/24,000 chance of a direct impact.  (I am sure that more informed people will come up with much better estimates in the not too distant future.)",1362063991

When you take the lead you give late comers the advantage of looking at what you have done to improving upon.  Our infrastructure is absolutely massive when compared to, say, Estonia's (not to pick on them at all, great country).  This means that rolling out step improvements is very costly.  There's something pro-government folk seem to insist on ignoring: ROI.  Companies can't roll out new massive infrastructures and throw away investment from the prior generation.  Yes, progress in the context of a significantly larger system will look and feel slower.  Our next generation IP infrastructure is being incubated today through experiments and evolution.

For example Ipsos Mori is mainly scheduled physical panels and not online (some of it is still paper collection!?!) so any shift in behaviour isn&#x27;t immediately noticed. It can take a week or so for anything to become apparent.<p>Opinion changes very rapidly when there are political items on the table. Sometimes within hours. YouGov wins here as it can constantly obtain data almost in a stream-like format and adjust rapidly. They had a thing called BrandIndex that did that a few years ago as well with brand opinions based on advertising and press scraping.<p>Usually the last minute swings are because there has been a lot of focus on this subject recently in the press which means people are likely to commit to firmer decisions based on research, actually decide to communicate their decisions or are relatively conservative at making decisions.<p>If you look at how these things are worded, they are always in the form of NO to the status quo and YES to change as well. This means that people less conservative with their opinions will be apparent up front and people more conservative (and usually more intelligent) will lag behind.<p>The nature of the vote depends on which group goes which way.<p>Watch these stats over the next few major political events - it&#x27;s really interesting!",1410180569

Do you understand the costs of incorrect results?  First, incorrect results can have negative consequences for the consumers: for example, drugs that have harmful impacts and no beneficial ones for the people taking them (in addition to the cost of the drug, and the opportunity cost of not doing something else known to be beneficial).  Second, time is wasted following up incorrect results and work based on incorrect results would be worthless.  Third, the incorrect results would have to be overturned (and this communicated to everybody who had taken them as correct).<p>I think deciding whether to &quot;use correlation more to assume causation&quot; needs to take into account the costs and benefits of incorrect results, as well as the costs and benefits of correct results.

After ebay, we still have that same bit rolling around in the cabinet, we just feel guilty we haven&#x27;t gotten around to selling it on ebay yet.<p>A lot of people feel worse about selling something for 20% of purchase price than they would about buying something during a 20% sale which is an interesting aspect that crosses into all technical / capitalistic type hobbies.

If happen to have a winter with little or no snow or ice, then the number of auto accidents will go down no matter what the latitude:  So, latitude can&#x27;t be the cause; ice and snow on the roads is the cause.  So, if live in a lower latitude, say, closer to the equator, and get a freak winter snow storm with a lot of ice and snow on the roads, the we will see auto accidents in spite of the latitude.<p>For indirect causation, I just said winter weather to try to be brief.

I have some of my grandfather&#x27;s tools also.  Its not like computer gaming where a $500 video card today is not even a decent paperweight in two years.  It is true that modern Chinese junk is value engineered to fall apart quickly and profitably, but none the less I have a new-ish belt sander that refuses to break despite some pretty heavy use.<p>As for space, all houses north of a certain latitude have basements and virtually all of them have some kind of shop area however humble it may be.  Even my mother in law has a folding card table with a 5 gallon bucket of abused hand tools.  The standard of living is lower in some areas, but alternatives may be possible.  Even today, I&#x27;ll do major sanding jobs outside in my back yard to keep the mess out of the house, and I always do finishing outdoors for obvious chemical reasons.<p>Labor cost is less than zero in that I&#x27;m willing to spend money for recreation.  Its a hobby, just like WoW or EVEonline or exotic cooking or ham radio or watching TV, its just that almost accidentally, some nice wooden projects escape the shop.  That adds a grind game reward... if I had to burn absolutely everything produced in the fire pit as scrap, it wouldn&#x27;t be as much fun.<p>I have looked into the saw stop and it scares me because its an active safety crutch and expensive both capital and ongoing (internet gossip implies they supposedly fire randomly in use, not just when you touch them with a hand).<p>I have multiple layers of relatively cheap passive safety measures which I couldn&#x27;t afford if I spent the money on a single active sawstop.<p>From a safety culture perspective reliance on one active gadget is very much like &quot;Oh, no need to patch those servers, we have a magic firewall&quot;.",1410177715

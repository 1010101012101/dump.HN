It could be tobacco, porn, alcohol, or shopping, but nevertheless you will find your outlet for your addictive behaviour. Different addictions come with different consequences.

I&#x27;ve kicked around the idea of having the server component keep track of which tunnels are currently open by all of the developers on an &quot;account&quot; and then exposing them in the web interface so you would have an easy index to your coworkers&#x27; dev work.

Off the top of my head:<p>- The insta-airplane-mode-wifi-bluetooth buttons in iOS7. These are a straight lift from Android, and have been hotly demanded by users for a long time.<p>- Notification Center is an incredibly uncanny look-and-feel-alike of notifications in Android. It&#x27;s basically an outright clone - though this isn&#x27;t an iOS7 development.<p>- The new app switcher is a takeoff from webOS. Swipe to close an app is also implemented almost precisely like it was on webOS. Claims that this came from Android are IMO off the mark. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to say they repurposed the Safari tab-switcher, considering the gestures bear such an uncanny resemblance to the webOS implementation.",1372276572

It captures the battle of Red Cliff, a peak moment in the book, and the events leading up to it. It&#x27;s hugely, hugely EPIC. I&#x27;m a sucker for this genre, so I loved it. Also, it convinced me that John Woo can make great movies - when he&#x27;s at home, operating within the realm of his native culture. When in Hollywood, he seems merely okay.

Who cares about the zillion times one has to cut away a piece of wood using a lathe to create a sphere if one uses a device that _adds_ material to the object?<p>Yes, it is good that there is software that understands G-code for 3D printers, but using it as _the_ data format? Ridiculous. That would be as if one used plotter instructions to print in 2D; instead of &quot;here is a rectangle; fill it with pure red&quot;, one would have zillions of &quot;move pen to x,y; draw to x,z; move to x,y+0.01; draw to x,z+0.01; move to x,y+0.02,…&quot; instructions.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t even think G-code is that good of an idea for generic CNC files.

Aside from calling your representatives in congress and encouraging everyone you know to do the same.<p>The electorate is uninformed and easily manipulated. Bias in the news media is generally to support the status quo and not rock the boat. Lively debate occurs mostly for easily understood and emotional issues. Covering complex issues with complex answers is not a winning strategy for aggressive ad revenue goals.<p>With an uninformed and easily manipulated electorate, elections are largely influenced by money.  Corporations and wealthy people contribute the most money to election campaigns, and therefore have a significant amount of influence over policy decisions and positions. Gerrymandering is also a huge problem and further reduces the amount of debate and competition during elections.<p>Lawrence Lessig (through rootstrikers.org) is a pioneer in raising awareness on how damaging the above situation is to a healthy functioning democracy. Awareness is the best thing we can do to improve the situation.

The highest priority is to make sure that we get all required patches to support GHCJS merged into GHC, before 7.8.1 is out. GHCJS is a standalone, cabal installable compiler (it uses the GHC API), but some features, like the &quot;foreign import javascript&quot; FFI need some minor changes in GHC itself.<p>We haven&#x27;t really spent much time optimizing for code size yet, and there&#x27;s still lots of low hanging fruit. We will never reach 3kB minified though, for example the JSBN library (that we use to implement Integer) alone is a lot bigger than that.<p>The GHCJS linker does tree shaking: Only functions that are reachable from main are included in the result.

5948325,comment,5945179,5946053,3,0,alexjeffrey,,,"Ok here we go.<p>Feminism as taken from an encyclopedia is basically equated with the equal rights movement for women. I am in 100% support of this side of feminism and the idea that all people regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation and so many other dimensions should live as equals.<p>The feminism I am against is that which seems to have strongly influenced gender politics in recent years in such areas as domestic violence convictions, accusations of rape, how divorces are perceived and handled and so many other important issues. This is the feminism that says men are inherently sexist and that the whole system of life and governance (the &quot;patriarchy&quot;) is designed for the systematic rape, enslavement and degradation of women.<p>However, this isn&#x27;t the point you&#x27;ve raised in this most recent comment so I&#x27;ll try to address that instead. You say that the fact that the blogger is a feminist doesn&#x27;t matter, and you&#x27;re completely correct. However, seeing some self-professed &quot;dirty old man&quot; make a comment about how Marissa Mayer looks attractive and jumping straight onto &quot;he&#x27;s being sexist!&quot; is a classic feminist move and is what&#x27;s being criticised here. Sure, the comment was inappropriate in a professional environment, but it&#x27;s not like the guy was saying &quot;how do you expect us to take you seriously, you&#x27;re a woman&quot;. The fact of the matter is men are physiologically built to recognise and look for beauty in women, and there&#x27;s nothing sexist about that. Mislabelling everything as being sexist against women is how said feminists seem to be able to hide blatant sexism against men as if it were a perfectly normal belief to hold, and I will happily attempt to neutralise any such statement if only to try to minimise some of the extreme views that can grow from it.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m reading too deeply into this now so all I can do is suggest you watch some videos and read some posts by Karen Straughan aka girlwriteswhat. She very succintly covers the issues with modern (some would say radical) feminism while at the same time advocating for equal rights, and hopefully from taking in some of her points you&#x27;ll be able to understand why I&#x27;ve reacted so strongly to your suggestion that feminism is &quot;a no-brainer&quot;.",1372274344

That's a copyright violation, and without a DMCA policy like this Y Combinator is by default liable for the infringement.<p>The DMCA policy and registered agent gives a content creator a method to notify Y Combinator of the violation so YC can take it down. How else would they know who to contact or how to protect their rights?<p>If a site has a proper policy and agent (and abides by the policy) it gets safe harbor - it's not liable for the infringement. It's not an unreasonable amount of effort, and the scheme is a pretty decent compromise between protecting copyright holders rights and allowing user generated content.",1354658364

I also printed my slides on index cards, along with some notes on what was supposed to be said for that slide,  and had them with me since, as I it happened, when i gave my talk I needed some prompts.<p>I also practiced a lot.  I hate it, but it helps, so there you go.<p>Ignite talks are a different sort of animal, where timing is very important (since you have no control over the slide change speed).   But I found this approach of use for more casual presentations; it's still a good idea to have a good idea of how much time you will take and how well it all flows.<p>What I found was that you can start with something that would take 30 minutes to read to a crowd, edit out the cruft, the joke slides,  and the amusing-but-unimportant factoids, and whittle you talk down to something punchy and concise.<p>Most talks are too long.  Modulo topic and subject complexity I'd say they should be no more than 20 minutes.<p>Even if you're not doing an Ignite talk, plan as if you were and be mindful about how and why you make it longer.

The main point isn't whether or not a service shows you ads.  For example, the suggested e-mail provider, Lavabit, shows ads to certain classes of users.<p>Rather, the point is whether the service sells your information to advertisers, or mines your information-- including the contents of any messages you send via the service.  Often this data mining is done in order to target advertisements at you, but the targeted ads, per se, are not the point.<p>For example, the main objection to Google Search isn't that they use the information to target advertisements (it even admits that doing so may allow Google to serve you more useful ads).  Instead, the stated rationale for using DDG is ""if you're worried about the amount of data collected on your browsing habits...""<p>Others on this discussion have pointed out that a lot of people are willing to make that exchange (trade off a little privacy in exchange for a good service).  That's fair.  But the article is clearly written for those who want to limit the inspection and selling of their personal information, <i>not</i> those who want to avoid advertising.<p>Oddly, the second part of your post shows that you understand the distinction.

4873294,comment,4871994,4873052,9,0,chimeracoder,,,"> As an Android user that recently downgraded from 4.0 to 2.3, it is frankly infuriating: you can only get the latest GMail app for Android if you are on 3.0+, which leaves the vast majority of Android users stuck with what is now a 4th rate app.<p>As of this Thursday, Gingerbread is two years old. Why would you downgrade to such an old version? That's comparable to running iOS 4 on an iPhone 3GS. I got an iPhone in June, and I'm already being told that I can't upgrade several applications because I'm not running the latest version of iOS and on the latest iPhone.<p>Second of all, ""vast majority"" is a bit of a stretch. 55% are on Gingerbread and 15% on pre-Gingebread[1], but given that Android encompasses a lot of lower-end phones that are simply feature phones as well, that's not really comparable to an iOS, which is used exclusively for smartphones. Many of those users frankly won't care that they're not able to use the latest version of the Gmail application - in fact, they may not be using it at all to begin with.<p>> Android users stuck with what is now a 4th rate app.<p>This is a secondary point of yours, but I should add that I don't consider even the Froyo version of Gmail to be a 4th rate app, let alone Gingerbread or beyond. I can name several ways that the Android app outperforms the iOS Gmail app.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tmonews.com/2012/10/google-releases-october-distribution-chart-for-android-version-breakdown/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tmonews.com/2012/10/google-releases-october-distr...</a>",1354655566

Besides the fact that the browser can trivially redirect to the exact app in the app store, I'm already annoyed that ABC wants me to download their god damn app everytime I accidentally click on one of their articles on Google News.<p>Not only that, but if the user has the app installed they're already prompted to open the same content with the app instead of the browser if they want.<p>This problem is already solved. This is very, very common in Android apps and I understand it is a new feature in iOS6 as well.<p>I guess if this is absolutely necessary, the browser could output a new header for domains that are declared in the .ipa/.apk that would notify the server that they have the app installed... and then they could force the app to open with a regular redirect.

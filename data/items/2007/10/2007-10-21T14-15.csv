70874,comment,70746,70772,0,0,edw519,,,"""at a very particular time""<p>...that doesn't hold a candle to today.  Make no mistake about it: the stunning success of the microcomputer was caused by businesses, not individuals.  And that success took quite a while... Microsoft-1975, Apple II-1977, IBM PC-1981, adoption by business 1984-1990.<p>Fast forward 2007.  A reader of this post with nothing right now could conceivably have millions of users within a year.  You said it yourself: ""inconceivable"".  That word no longer exists.  THAT's why today is ""the best of times"".",1192978099

""25 years after graduation, 500 Yale MBAs were asked what was the most important course.  Organizational Behavior was their #1 answer.""  Ridiculous, I thought, it had to be Finance or Marketing.  They were right.  Nothing is more important in business that your relationship with other people.  Nothing.

I lived in Japan for about 1.5 years, and was amazed that you need to memorize at least 6000 kanji to be able to read the newspaper well.  I was able to speak and answer the phone after about 6 months and learned their two phonetic alphabets (1 for Japanese words, and one identical in meaning but not in look for 'foreign' words. But the kanji were overwhelming.)  <p>My theory is that all of this memorization has a cost, and I think it is no accident that languages requiring so much memory expense tend to have users less able to innovate and integrate ideas given the mental overhead required. (I was in Japan because, for those of you who have not visited, Japan has some of the ugliest urban environments imaginable and they need help architecturally.  Ancient Japanese architecture from the Imperial days is beautiful, but modern work tends to be completely non-integrated and non-harmonious with a few notable exceptions.)",1192976998

IT has little to do with it.  Implementing back office and supply chain software is like striking out the pitcher; everyone can do it.  Where is the real business innovation based on technology?  That's what people here want to talk about.<p>",1192976898

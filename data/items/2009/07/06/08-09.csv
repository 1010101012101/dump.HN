This is one of the reasons why some of Ikea's new locations have stood unopened for years, while waiting for permits from local governments (read: while refusing to pay bribes).<p>Может тебе сам перестать придумывать вещи, и посмотреть в зеркало?",1246870721

I guess, either shove it or leave.<p>In Moscow, there was an accident when an aquapark full of people collapsed due to bad engineering and construction, too. So, maybe those delays aren't just corruption?\nAlso: In South Korea, there's a history of mall collapsing under its weight due to poor engineering and exploitation;<p>The bottom line is: If it would be corruption alone, they'd bribe and move on; they're huge. So, it's not just corruption.\nAnd as of stopping investments, maybe they're just out of money in their Sweden?<p>""The retailer has become such an icon of Russia's boom that today's yuppies are called ""the Ikea Generation.""""\nThis is crap, never heard anything remotely like that.\nPerhaps stop making things up?",1246870149

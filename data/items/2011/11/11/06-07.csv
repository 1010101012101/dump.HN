The recovery is going to be a very long process. Unfortunately I doubt that will happen. Even the idea of marijuana legalization is scoffed at by a city (Washington DC) which is fueled by the very cocaine and pills it purports to abhor.<p>I would propose creating an open database dedicated to tracking individuals known or believed to be associated with violent drug cartels. Perhaps call it a crowd sourced intelligence network.<p>Knowing that a government official being anonymously accused of being corrupt recently went on vacation in a foreign country and stayed at a 5 star hotel would go a long way in validating suspicions when combined with other data points, such as their relatives purchasing large quantities of real estate.<p>Presumably no cartel member or corrupt official operates with complete anonymity. When hundreds of individuals are able to combine their reports together, the ""social network"" of a criminal organization should be completely visible to all.<p>While I strongly advocate individual anonymity and privacy rights, anyone who explicitly infringes and impedes the rights of others has no rights.<p>This is a guerrilla war which can only be won by its own victims.",1320994501

I certainly can't argue with your experience, and there's probably more truth to it now with modern tools and methods than there was when I was growing up. I work for a company that provides such tools - one of the things we're able to eliminate is the labour involved in simply driving around and making sure all the bores are drawing water for livestock - on a large farm this can nearly be a full-time job in itself.<p>It <i>sounds</i> like you've got a hobby farm. I could be way off kilter, but if that's the case, perhaps you're not as financially dependent on every crop, and can afford increasing the risk of disaster?

It's brutal. She arrives 8am to prep and leaves 11pm after service, 6 days a week when she was working for someone else. 7 now that she's opening her own place. She's on her feet all day. The job is both time critical and requires constant teamwork. If you or anyone else drops the ball the angry customer is right there, including the angry wait staff and angry team mates. It's very high pressure.<p>She's now busy opening her own restaurant and it's a far cry from writing software once and kicking back while each incremental copy sold costs you zero effort or money. Every incremental product a chef sells is hand-made and has to have its raw ingredients bought without any certainty it'll actually get sold. What's worse is many ingredients have a shelf life of mere days.<p>Every product is hand made to a customer's specifications and delivered in real-time with immediate feedback. If a product is rejected, it's expected to be replaced immediately without interrupting the flow of products heading out to new customers. And of course the tools of the trade are not a keyboard, but sharp knives and open flames.<p>So yeah, the ""google chef scenario"" comment bugged me too.",1320993902

Thus any negotiation becomes a sort of pretend dance and is as likely as not to result in bad morale.<p>I think that at least for accounting purposes the shares are officially ""earned"" at the end of each work day during the vesting period.  I think the argument could be made that while an employee may perceive a grant of unvested ISOs as compensation at the time they are granted, they are indeed not compensation but an optional incentive for the employer to use in the event that an employee is extremely valuable during a period of rapid growth where turnover would be harmful to the company's prospects.<p>If the ISOs were meant to be compensation, why not have them vest immediately... the employee still would not have to pay taxes on them until they were exercised and the mechanism incentivizing performance is there simply via the purchase price.",1320992912

I got stiffed on an exit so you can take my view as biased if you would like. It most likely is given my irritation at the subject, I generally don't get worked up over stuff so it has certainly hit a nerve.<p>But the part that really gets me is it has absolutely nothing to do with the role these people played and every bit to do with the longer hours, reduced compensation risk and how long a person takes that risk for. If they came in on the ground floor then have been riding the roller-coaster and getting paid dirt for longer then they deserve those early and current options, I just cannot understand the attitude that is being displayed where the CEO feels that later employees that are ""now"" more strategic to the company (read executives) are more deserving of that equity given their worth to the current goals of the company. That is such a warped perspective, it has nothing to do with the future and everything to do with how much risk and how long those early employes took that risk for.",1320992371
3223634,comment,3222511,3223206,3,0,davidcuddeback,,,"> Yeah, it's pretty hard to prove you were fired for an illegal reason, especially if your employer has a paper trail<p>In the case for which I was a jury member, a women sued her previous employer for wrongful termination, claiming she was fired for whistle-blowing. Her job was a safety inspector at a refinery and she raised some concerns about the safety procedures involved with cleaning some tanks. She even had documentation (in the form of emails), which showed that some of her coworkers raised a stink about her concerns.<p>The problem is, no matter why a company actually fires you, they can always make a reason. And I don't think it's hard to come up with a pretense for firing someone. In the case that I served on, the women had hired one of the company's contractors to do work at her home using company machinery and provided reasonable evidence that her bosses knew about it. She was fired for ""conflict of interest."" Ultimately, we decided in the company's favor. It honestly wasn't even close. There were about 10 questions that would have had to answer yes to, and we only made it to the second one (and almost didn't make it that far).<p>Still, I'm surprised that at-will employment never came up in this case. It seems relavent. And the company's lawyer definitely seemed worth his salt.",1320992354

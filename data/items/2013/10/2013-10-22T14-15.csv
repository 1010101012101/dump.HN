6592314,comment,6592025,6592247,4,0,grrrando,,,"Bad experience: Joined a space in March, it closed before the end of May. Found out it was at severe risk of closing a week into my membership, without ever being told about it as I was checking the space out. They had a 30-day termination notice clause in membership contract, which had to match up to the billing cycle. So I was locked into that second month even though I knew the time there was, more or less, wasted.<p>In my case, I was looking for a space with people I could interact with and get to know and be comfortable and happy around (&#x27;coworkers&#x27;, natch). The looming death of the space totally killed any potential for that to happen. That&#x27;s why I consider the time/money a waste.<p>Lesson: ask how &quot;healthy&quot; the space is when you&#x27;re &quot;interviewing&quot; the space.",1382453962
6592312,comment,6591299,6591787,4,0,johnsoft,,,"There are a few language corners that don&#x27;t translate, such as:<p><pre><code>    var x = &quot;&quot;.constructor(5);
    // The property &#x27;constructor&#x27; does not exist on value of type &#x27;String&#x27;.

The exceptions make sense if you dig into how the type system works. AFAIK these can always be worked around with an explicit cast to any:<p><pre><code>    var x = (<any>&quot;&quot;).constructor(5);

What types of customers will be using your system, what is the average charge, what countries will you be targeting are also a good starting point. Also, will you be selling to companies that have pre-established POS systems and credit card processing capabilities?<p>Your best bet may be to develop a processor-agnostic POS system, meaning that your system will work with most major processors. Otherwise you will be selling two solutions instead of one. The first solution will be the POS system itself, but the most difficult sale will be getting an established company to switch credit card processors to utilize your system. Unless you can offer them some financial incentive to switch you will be the underdog from the starting gate.<p>Also, since every business is different, having a one-size-fits-all credit card processor is impossible. Different volume levels, monthly charge volume, types of customers, types of business, and other risk factors will all directly influence the rates a processor will give your customer.",1382453832

I would compare the &quot;Life Expectancy from Age X&quot; graph for the U.S. against the same graphs for other countries. Then I would look at leading causes of death for each age group in the U.S. Then I would have a much more quantifiable idea of why citizens in other countries tend to live longer than U.S. citizens.<p>Here&#x27;s an interesting podcasts where a couple of economists discuss this kind of metric as a measure of longevity and health: <a href=""http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2012/07/scott_atlas_on.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2012/07/scott_atlas_on.html</a><p>EDIT: This is important because counting thousands of premature births and having a much higher rate of death due to accidents and violence will really wreck the U.S. average.

They only allow safari to load the stream. And safari is officially discontinued for windows.

At my current income an extra 1000 would be nice but wouldn&#x27;t really change anything at all in the short term.  For a rich dude that&#x27;s not even a rounding error.  For a starving student it would be a huge amount of money.  So I would expect no inflation in things appealing to the upper classes, minimal effect for the middle classes, but huge effect on the lower classes.  Even on supposedly interchangeable things like food, this is going to have a huge effect on the price of hot pockets and malt liquor but not much change in the price of lobster tails and beef tenderloin.",1382453693

6592236,comment,6589481,6590029,3,0,lambda,,,"I think one of the key points about food science is that you should always be skeptical of it.<p>In general, it is very difficult to do controlled, large population studies over a human life span. Instead, lots of studies rely on self-reported surveys, measurements of various indicators that are believed to correlate with poor heath effects over a very short period, and so on.<p>Mapping from &quot;we know that if you eat X, the Y level in your blood rises over the next 24 hours, and in a separate study we have shown that Y is correlated with chronic disease Z&quot; is actually a pretty poor argument for &quot;X causes Z&quot;, and even more of a poor argument for &quot;thus, you should eliminate X from your diet&quot;, and telling people to eliminate &quot;X&quot; from their diet doesn&#x27;t necessarily always lead to simply the desired effect of eliminating &quot;X&quot;, but may lead to them replacing it with &quot;W&quot; which is even worse.<p>Human bodies and human behavior are quite complex. The actual effects of a particular recommendation are not well understood. By making recommendations and policy from science that was not well enough understood, we may have increased the rate of growth of the obesity epidemic over the past 30 years or so. This has happened, in part, by over-emphasizing &quot;low fat&quot; which encouraged people to replace fat with sugars.<p>So, food policy recommendation are not food science. They may be influenced by science, but they are different. And I generally take them with a very large grain of salt.<p>Instead, we can find strategies that, at least anecdotally, seem to work better than adhering to the latest fad diet or the government recommendations. Eat real food; plants and animals that have been minimally processed before getting to you. The more processing that has been done, the more the foods have likely been optimized for something other than nutritional value and flavor (shelf life, profits, etc). Don&#x27;t eat too much; whatever you do, if you want to lose weight, eating less across the board will likely achieve that. Food that is decadent is likely good to have only in small quantities; if it&#x27;s sweet or greasy, it&#x27;s probably good to limit to lower quantities. Get exercise daily; walk, or bike somewhere, hit the gym, do an outdoor activity, or something, don&#x27;t go from bed to car to chair to car to couch to bed.<p>Following these kinds of recommendations may not seem as official or authoritative as the government or some author selling a new diet book. But anecdotally, they work pretty well, and they aren&#x27;t likely to be skewed by various parties monetary interests or simply bad interpretation and over-generalization of good scientific data.",1382453366

The first is that although it supports many forms of package specification, including VCS repositories, it does not report the package spec according to the way that it was installed, but rather according to the package name and version according to its setup.py. Say you install a package from a git commit that fixed a bug in the PyPI 1.0.0 package whose version is still reported as 1.0.0 in setup.py at the commit. Then you freeze the environment to requirements.txt to distribute. It&#x27;s still reported as package==1.0.0 instead of the git spec, so the next person to install will pull down the broken version from PyPI instead. The other headache is that installing from a requirements file just installs dependencies in the order they&#x27;re listed, so oftentimes you need to re-organize the output of `pip freeze` to make sure dependencies are installed in the right order, otherwise you can encounter things like unexpected package versions due to other packages making ambiguous dependency specs for dependencies of your own app.",1382452642

It was a little amusing that we went to war in Iraq (under the WAR ON TERROR banner) immediately after Hussein switched to the Euro as the default currency. [1] Even in it&#x27;s weakened state, the Petrodollar is still the main currency of choice.<p>2) The Gold Standard switch is the tip of the iceberg. We should be talking about the US Bankruptcy. Check out the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 (specifically, the 1933 amendment) [2], and House Joint Resolution 192 of June 5th, 1933 [3]. Those two acts set up the perpetual state of war in the US, though some would say it happened when congress went <i>sine die</i> during the civil war.<p>3) Fiat money is _awesome_ in a world in bankruptcy. Since 1933, people/citizens are the source of all money. we live in a world of abundance now since the industrial revolution, and in the next 20 years, as machines take over all the old grunt-labor jobs, we&#x27;re going to have a glut of people unable to do the jobs they were trained to do. under any resource-backed economy (gold, oil), this would be catastrophic. However, this is why we have institutions like the Bank of International Settlements in place, to post bonds and discharge debt for insolvent countries/corporations. Money is debt, as the Youtube video tells us. We&#x27;re now in a world where a Promise to Pay (an IOU) is in fact the money itself [4]. In this world, everyone that has a &quot;Sophisticated Investor&quot; level of understanding of the game can act as their own BIS, effectively becoming another Carnegie, Rockefeller, Warburg, or Oppenheimer.<p>I suspect you&#x27;re a lewrockwell.com reader, or at least one who follows a more libertarian leaning (correct me if wrong). Back when I was championing the gold standard, I used to say a lot of the same things. Much of what they said was right, but was missing the massive caveat that it was only correct within the confines of HJR-192. Gold/Silver is only payable for private commerce outside the jurisdiction of Wickard v. Filburn [5] nowadays. Michael Badnarik, former Libertarian Presidential Candidate, teaches a common law class that explains many of these concepts, so that you can preserve and exercise those pre-1933 rights [6].<p>[1] <a href=""http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,998512,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,998512,...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/95a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/95a</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.focusoncommerce.net/index_htm_files/LAW%20-%20House%20Joint%20Resolution%20192.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.focusoncommerce.net/index_htm_files/LAW%20-%20Hou...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negotiable_instrument"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negotiable_instrument</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.lawnix.com/cases/wickard-filburn.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lawnix.com/cases/wickard-filburn.html</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-a_yR1jzHY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-a_yR1jzHY</a>",1382452551

You don&#x27;t think the railroads and telegraph contributed to the settling of the West?

Mostly I just don&#x27;t know a great deal of legal history and this historical &quot;worst case ever&quot; is what came to mind. However, I have never seen the unfortunate Mr. Scott <i>blamed</i> for the infamous <i>Dred Scott v. Sandford</i> decision. So, bad court decisions: not new. Blaming the victims of those decisions: new.<p>Mostly it just speaks to an audacious sense of <i>entitlement</i> on the part of any attorney who upon news of a fresh new legal outrage, immediately excoriates the victims of our federal Department of Injustice. When he says a society without Lavabit is better than a society in which Lavabit doesn&#x27;t have him (or a similarly experienced and wise litigator) on retainer, that is self-serving. He is fundamentally no different than the feds, because he also wants the legal profession to act as a check on all innovation. The slight cosmetic difference is that he wants to be the one running things, because his judgment is better than that of the feds.<p>Of course we mustn&#x27;t fall victim to the classic <i>is/ought</i> confusion.

Fresh fruit is high in fiber, which tends to lead to less absorption of sugars and other carbohydrates. The equivalent amount of fructose in soda or fruit juice is much worse for you than in the form of whole fresh fruits.<p>If you take a look at that study you link to about average consumption, over half of it comes from &quot;sugar sweetened beverages&quot; and &quot;grains&quot; (which includes cakes, pies, snacks, breads, and cereals).

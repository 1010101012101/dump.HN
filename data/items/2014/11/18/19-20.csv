The proposal might read as follows:<p>&quot;Objects with IDs between 0 and 2055, inclusive, are considered <i>unreleasable</i>. The Python runtime shall initialize the refcount of these objects to 1 when they are first used, and shall make no guarantee that the refcount on such objects accurately reflects the true number of references to that object. Native extensions may increase and decrease the refcount on these objects as if they were normal objects; if those extensions are well-behaved, then the refcount should never decrease below 1. However, native extensions that can statically reason about whether an object is likely to be unreleasable, may benefit in performance by checking for whether objects passed to their functions are indeed unreleasable, and refraining from modifying or checking their refcount in such cases.&quot;",1416340405

8625917,comment,8624979,8625089,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Economics. Suppose you have a factory and a growing order book but you&#x27;re running at or near full capacity; if you get any substantial increase in the number of orders, it&#x27;s going to take longer and longer to fulfill them, and customers might start to go your competitors if they feel the quality of your service has dropped. This is a <i>diseconomy of scale</i> - you&#x27;ve run out of room to grow and the more business you get the lower your margins.<p>The obvious solution would be to set up another factory. Suppose for simplicity that this costs $25 million and allows a doubling of capacity. suppose further that TeeSpring is making a profit of $100,000 a week (a completely imaginary figure - I know nothing about their finances). Because it&#x27;s near full capacity that weekly net isn&#x27;t going to increase much. But saving up the money to purchase the factory outright would take 4-5 years - an <i>organic growth</i> strategy - is plenty of time for competitors to move against you and pull away customers.<p>So you have a couple of options. You could go into debt, either by getting a loan or issuing a bond that pays interest (effectively the same thing). Now some of your income goes on interest payments, but they&#x27;re tax-deductible and after you&#x27;ve paid off the debt you&#x27;ll still have the second factory. As long as the increased income resulting from the investment is greater than the cost of borrowing the capital then going into debt can be perfectly sensible - the same reason it makes good sense for governments to splurge on necessary infrastructure during periods of low interest rates, just like we&#x27;re not doing now due to politics :-/<p>Another option is to issue equity, ie sell shares in the company to raise the money. For large firms this may not be any more attractive than debt, because shareholders will expect a dividend of some sort. For growing firms it makes a ton of sense because early investors are not so much interested in dividends as in the possibility for the shares to appreciate in value - who wouldn&#x27;t have liked to invest $1 million in Google or any other large company back in the early days? This is ideal for a firm like Teespring that has a very simple and straightforward business model - manufacturing a basic consumer product like this is great from an investor&#x27;s POV because it&#x27;s so easy to analyze.",1416340318

I found this experience to be substandard; both from a perspective of consistency with managers who had Outlook and found calendaring to be pretty awful compared to Lotus notes.<p>This might be less important now that you can have your Calendar integrated into your smart phone, but I did not have a smart phone at the time.",1416340108

8625874,comment,8624160,8624919,0,0,AlyssaRowan,,,"Indeed, I think that might be viable: it certainly was for CloudFlare! And good ECC certainly is &quot;modern security techniques and best practices&quot;. I would however be OK with RSA-2048 using SHA-256, I guess; it&#x27;s what many other CAs currently use (and this is partially a lowest-denominator problem).<p>Comodo definitely has an ECC root available now, a cross-signed ECDSA root with secp384r1, signing a secp256r1 intermediate. (I had heard there were 3 others deployed out there, although off the top of my head I&#x27;m not clear about which they are, perhaps they&#x27;re also cross-signed?)<p>Why is ECC so poorly deployed in TLS? I&#x27;ve heard indications Certicom had formerly aggressively asserted patents, hence the lack of ECC-supporting CAs; but I don&#x27;t know which ones. I highly doubt they&#x27;re still extant, however: many have since expired.<p>Do be aware however that ECDSA can present a huge hazard if the <i>k</i> value needed for every signature is even partially predictable and varies. Officially, it should be random, and <i>very strongly</i> random (even the first two bits being consistently predictable is cumulatively disastrous; using the exact same <i>k</i> to sign two different things is absolutely catastrophic and is how the Sony PS3 root keys were calculated!). If you have a strong PRF for your RNG, you should be fine (e.g. LibreSSL uses ChaCha20); if you want some insurance just in case, you can use a more-auditable and less fragile deterministic process with a strong PRF so the same signature always gets the same, unpredictable <i>k</i> (see RFC 6979), or a combination of the two approaches (e.g. BoringSSL). DSA also had this issue. If you haven&#x27;t audited your RNG and know it&#x27;s strong, maybe you should check it before you deploy ECDSA: if your system&#x27;s headless, its entropy is running on empty and your idea of a mixing function is RC4, it might not be such a hot idea.<p>It&#x27;d be fantastic to have the option available to have an ECC root around, and let us have RSA or ECC certs. (Yes, you can cross-sign across algorithms.) Perhaps have ECDSA off by default for a while in light of the above, but it can provide <i>very</i> good performance for people who use modern software and turn it on!<p>I&#x27;d suggest using secp256r1 (aka NIST P-256). It&#x27;s already deployed and 256-bit curves lie at about RSA-3072 strength (stronger than most deployed CAs now, which typically use RSA-2048). A few others have deployed secp384r1, but that was following the NSA&#x27;s Suite B lead; I&#x27;m not sold on that being relevant at all. secp256r1 is also fairly fast, with some very well-optimised constant-time routines available in OpenSSL if you enable a flag or even faster ones if you&#x27;re using 1.2 beta (expect something like a 200%-250% performance boost over the generic elliptic curve routines); it&#x27;s not quite Curve25519 speed, but it isn&#x27;t bad.<p>I do however acknowledge the extreme murkiness surrounding the generation of the NIST/SECG/X9.62 curves. That does present <i>some</i> concern to me. I tried to get to the bottom of that (see my posts on CFRG) and I can summarise what I found out as basically (now-expired/irrelevant) patent-related shenanigans. I&#x27;m not super-comfortable with that degree of opacity in my curves - however, I also don&#x27;t know of any actual security problems with secp256r1 (or secp384r1) as they stand, <i>providing they are properly implemented</i> (very big proviso!). I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re backdoored, but make sure you check the hinges on the front door, and I&#x27;d prefer a house with better foundations!<p>More transparently-produced curves (such as the Brainpool curves) do exist, but Brainpool is sadly very slow in software (less than half the speed than a good P256 routine, and no scope for optimisations).<p>So looking forward, CFRG (at IRTF) were asked by the TLS Working Group to recommend even better new curves: most probably Curve25519 in my opinion as that seems to admirably satisfy all the criteria for a fast strong mainstream curve, and probably one larger &quot;extra paranoid&quot; curve will be recommended which I really don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;ll be at this stage. These hopefully will be/are even faster, strong, <i>and</i> rigidly-explained, without murky origins. And hopefully there will be better algorithms than ECDSA (perhaps a Schnorr-based algorithm such as Ed25519, now the patent expired?). I very much doubt if all the supporting infrastructure for that like HSMs and widely-deployed software support will all be &quot;ready&quot; for this project, however, in the timeframe we&#x27;d like, however, so in the meantime, P256 or RSA-2048 I guess is OK.<p>In general: This is absolutely wonderful news. It, and the efficiency of TLS 1.2 (and later, TLS 1.3) will enable people to run TLS everywhere. I am very probably going to use it myself.<p>While the Israel-based CA StartCom do already offer free TLS certificates and I have previously lauded them for that, they pulled an absolutely unforgivable move detrimental to internet security as a whole in refusing to revoke and rekey certificates for free <i>even exceptionally in the immediate wake of Heartbleed</i> (and I do think they should have their CA status reviewed very harshly as a result or revoked, because I do <i>not</i> think that is compliant with CA/B guidelines: they definitely still have live signatures on compromised keys that have not been revoked, which is totally unacceptable). If this initiative means we can replace and dump bad CAs, it&#x27;s even better news.",1416339865

8625811,comment,8625222,8625456,0,0,jallmann,,,"> the idea that static type checking makes developers more productive and prevents tons of errors is overstated<p>Then perhaps you are understating the importance of software correctness. While type systems can be an almost religious topic, the benefits of type checking are real -- a whole class of bugs to disregard, less testing code, and a more maintainable codebase for other developers. Moreover, for languages with ADTs and exhaustive type-checking, you are forced to reason about boundary and error conditions. All of which leads to higher quality software, at the minimal cost of up-front work when designing your types and fixing what the compiler/checker says.<p>> type related errors are usually easy to find and fix and have rarely if ever been the root cause of our most difficult problems.<p>Type related errors may be easy to diagnose and fix -- although by definition, in the absence of type-checking, type errors are only so after the fact, eg after causing a crash. Hence the utility of type checkers, especially if it means fewer avoidable errors appearing in production.<p>> Dynamic type checking and implicit conversion is one of the more powerful features of JavaScript and certainly no less prone to error or counter-productive than type-casting, making variadic functions or class templates are in other languages.<p>Type checking doesn&#x27;t diminish the usefulness/convenience of dynamic languages, but IMO lends more weight to the benefits of <i>strongly</i> static languages -- benefits which are negated by the abuse of &quot;features&quot; such as typecasting or variadic functions.",1416339192

I thought tjradcliffe might consider phrasing his comments more courteously next time. Of course he doesn&#x27;t have to, but I believe it would be the right thing to do, <i>especially</i> if someone is interested in healthy discussion and separation of theological and secular issues.<p>Anyway, the underlying questions about the role of God in nature and reality (and the exploration of it through science) are essentially metaphysical questions. Many people take materialism (all reality is physical, people are just fizzing bags of chemicals) as a first principle. Some of these people then dismiss other viewpoints as irrational.<p>A different position would be that proving God exists is hard to impossible and to prove materialism is true is not any easier. Again, it&#x27;s all metaphysical and a result of what first principles you start from. In a monotheistic view, scientific exploration and discovery only explain how the Designer created things. Even filling in gaps (like the fossil record) doesn&#x27;t disprove God&#x27;s existence, it could instead be showing that He created an internally consistent universe. Even old fossils cannot disprove God because He could have created the universe on Nov. 5, 1955 as if it had started with a big bang a long time ago.<p>My point is that, like any metaphysical question, there is no definitive answer that can be reached from physical evidence.<p>...so I think we should give each other some slack by keeping things civil. This includes forgoing pot shots that can&#x27;t fairly be responded to.<p>1. OK, so I digressed a little in hopes of convincing people to be more courteous.

But there&#x27;s also more tame stuff like implicit casting (which C# also has) that I&#x27;d also count as a form of weak typing.",1416337975

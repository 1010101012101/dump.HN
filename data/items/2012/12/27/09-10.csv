4972904,comment,4969187,4969187,1,0,bobdvb,,,"For those saying ""why not try Debian, mint, etc"", I've been running my mother on Debian for the past 18 months and it hasn't been at all easy and I am starting to wonder if I shouldn't move her back to Windows. I gave her fairly simple hardware (an Atom PC) with enough RAM and disk space. I migrated her to Picassa and Libre Office. She's surviving but supporting is a little tedious, there doesn't seem to be a convenient alternative to LogMeIn (any VNC requires mapping ports on the router and teamviewer needs user intervention at the target).\nI was also running Ubuntu with KDE on my main laptop at home but I recently bought a new laptop and my wife was delighted that it came with Windows 7 pre-installed. I haven't yet decided if Linux will go back on. Possibly not.<p>So much in domestic Linux is unprofessional, that is why the professional Linuxes command such money. Linux seems to remain a hobby system with similar process control because it allows everything, if you don't constrain your model then you can't ensure quality. For example: how much testing is done against the kernel? I don't mean beta testing, how about instituting some standards regime with unit testing and interface compliance measurement? Linux depends almost entirely on peer code review, in critical parts that is reviewed by 'experts' but it remains a manual process.",1356601695

4972846,comment,4964422,4969176,1,0,yechielkimchi,,,"Well, I find this discussion very interesting - esp. because it reveals so many misconceptions about programming in a tiny nutshell.\nLet me start by emphasizing that you were reading into the previous comment something the author didn't write. ""If your code runs into a broken invariant and you let it continue forward ..."" - I don't see anything even remotely associated with it: The claim was just that ""abort()"" in most cases is too strong a response.\n  Indeed ""ASSERTS ENFORCE INVARIANTS"" - but during debugging.  And invariants may be enforced using different mechanisms, assert(), as a very general tool/technique is simply and understandably very crude.  My view of assert() is two fold:\n1. It's a shotgun. In real life not every ""crime"" deserves capital punishment (and not all broken invariants are the same).\n2. All asserts are connected: They can only be turned on/off together (yes, you may use conditional compilation to overcome this problem, but in this case conditional compilation can be used for just a better system - where there are various severity levels for asserts).<p>All you have to realize is that not all problems need the same cure. Using your example, if it is found that a list broke it's invariant, isn't it enough to stop using this list (isolating it, not freeing it) and then gracefully terminate the program?\nThere is more to elaborate here, but  most readers can draw the correct conclusions.  Maybe this discussions exposes how much more we need to learn about software quality - where my page on bad books (the ones I have encountered) is just a very narrow opening to the real problems.",1356599420
4972845,comment,4969159,4969159,0,0,neya,,,"The author goes to conclude that Windows RT is an example of 'Flat Design' and doesn't even justify why.<p>FYI: In my opinion, the author's $5.99 EBook on design is the best example of 'Flat Design' (I bought one). He claims to teach you to design a web app from scratch, but whereas the book is more of a walkthrough for a basic app than a 'how-to' (which is what he claims). Once you purchase his book, you realize it was a 'flat-design' and not a curvy one.<p>The author is an Apple fanboy himself, bashing out the new Windows Metro UI under the guise of a design article. Two years from now, I'd love to meet the author and see him claim the same thing. The author has a blind-folded belief that 'Apple knows what they're doing' or rather the 'Apple can do no wrong' mindset. I guess that's why you never saw any articles on Apple maps on his blog.<p>Coming back to the point, if Apple knows what they're doing, I bet Microsoft knows much better, because they are #2 in the OS arena WORLDWIDE (google for stats). So, this ideology that the Metro UI sucks is just time-limited. It's only a matter of time that people get accustomed to it and they will and MS knows that.",1356599338

Unless you have very deep pockets as a startup, if you don't focus on monetization in the early stages, you're more than likely going to fail due simply to the high cost of launching and maintaining startups.

3176412,story,,,1,0,wesleyzhao,"30 Blog Posts in 30 Days Challenge: Join Us?",,"Hi HN!<p>Dan Shipper (dshipper) and I have decided that for the month of November, we are challenging/policing ourselves to write a blog post every single day for 30 days. And we're inviting anyone to join us!<p>As developers, we know that after a late night of coding the last thing we really want to do is write a blog post. But we figure that blogging is a great habit to get into for tech entrepreneurs and here are just a few reasons why:<p>1. You learn how to communicate better. 
We find that through the exercise of writing, we become better writers. And not only does that allow us to always communicate our thoughts and ideas better in writing, but we believe that it will help us do it verbally as well.<p>2. It forces you to think.
Coming up with creative, new, and interesting topics is not easy. But the ability to do so, is a skill we value.<p>3. You gain more web presence.
Not only is keeping an updated blog/site better for SEO, but if your blog is interesting and updated often, you encourage old readers to be engaged and new readers to get engaged. And the more readers you get, the more impact your posts have.<p>We know that ""forcing"" yourself to write too frequently can lead to poor content that nobody cares about, and thus doesn't actually help you at all, but we'll do our best to make sure we always stay fresh and interesting. And since there are no rewards for winning or staying on track, we hope that whoever cares to join us will also share the same mindset. After all, we are only doing this to get better. So with that in mind, if anybody would like to join us, please do!<p>We are keeping a list of blogs committed to this No-Blog-Sloth November Challenge here (post a link to your blog as a comment, or message us if you want to be included): http://bit.ly/30posts30daychallenge<p>And you can find a recap of the details (basically a verbatim of this post) here: http://bit.ly/30posts30daychallenge_details<p>The current list:<p>danshipper.com, wesleyzhao.com",1320036647

The idea is simply securing the boot process of an operating system from POST right through to the OS being ready for use. Having 2 operating systems is perfectly fine from that point of view as long as the integrity of the boot process can be maintained. Having a boot loader and 2 or more OS's available complicates things, but doesn't make it at-odds with secure booting.<p>Edit: Manually correcting autocorrect and adding a couple of words",1320034685

I got approximately 1.5% of downloads to convert, so that would be about .27% as you are measuring it.  Different markets, different acquisition strategies, and different apps will have <i>vastly</i> different numbers here.  It is also highly sensitive to time of the year in my market.<p>If you haven't looked at it before, optimizing a) the installation, b) the first run experience, and c) the checkout funnel (hint: start that funnel in the application, ideally roadblocking a customer from something they urgently want to do) produce big wins for comparatively little investment.  For example, for ~3 hours teaching people how to install software, you can get a big win in successful installations.  (You are likely counting 18% of visitors initiate downloads but, unless you take efforts otherwise, you have no clue how many downloads actually result in successful installations or executions of the product.)  Try downloading Skype and steal everything they do.<p>You can <i>really</i> increase download rates if you send targeted traffic at landing pages designed to encourage installation.

The secure boot is essentially optional from what I've seen so far; put Windows 8 on any old motherboard and it should work.<p>The whole reason this has come about is due to the vulnerability of people faking BIOS IDs and manufacturers on startup, allowing auto-authentication of pirate copies of Windows Vista and 7. In order for this auto-authentication to work in Windows 8 on a shipped bundle, secure boot will need to be activated. After the initial secure boot and activation, hopefully it can be turned off and allow more open access on OEM machines. (If it doesn't, <i>then</i> we have a problem.)",1320034109

The region then becomes a poster child for the 'I told you so's who will point at addicts, mess, and whatever external effects will come from that.  If it is experimented and ends up in very public failure, the topic will be removed from discussion for a generation.<p>This is partially the case in Amsterdam, where most Dutch people wouldn't be seen in the red light district, as it is overrun with drug and sex tourists, usually from other countries.  And do-gooders point to the Amsterdam red-light district and say 'see, do you want your town like that?', despite the fact that the laws are not Amsterdam specific, and apply to the country as a whole.  And the rest of the country is a very pleasant place to be.<p>So you need to relax laws slowly and simultaneously, so that the problems can be dealt with as they arise, and successful health management can be introduced at the same time.  And you have to take a very realistic view of the societal damage drug use can cause, no matter what type (ie beer or heroin).<p>Given these requirements, I can't see it <i>ever</i> happening in the foreseeable future, which pretty much guarantees the cartels will exist for a long time, possibly until they capture an entire nation and form an actual government.<p>EDIT: Just remembered a great line from the Ben Elton book (whose name I have forgotten) which is about removing drug laws.<p>The quote is something like : ""Do you really care if another person becomes a heroin addict if it means your Grandma will not get mugged on the way home""<p>Really, it's all about people not trying to always rule and control the lives of others.",1320033892

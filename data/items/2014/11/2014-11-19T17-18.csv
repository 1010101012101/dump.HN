This remarkable piece of engineering is a console app done completely in PHP and one of the first things it logged was &quot;Can&#x27;t keep up! Is the server overloaded?&quot;. That&#x27;s a completely idle server on a beefy box. And all I could think was how regrettable it was that a clearly capable programmer voluntarily painted himself in a corner by picking a language that wasn&#x27;t fit for the job. Same thing with GUI in PHP - yes, it&#x27;s doable, yes, there&#x27;s probably a demand for it, but this demand is misplaced and misguided and it&#x27;s not worth of endorsing. It&#x27;s like giving devs a heavier weight to sink deeper into a tar pit instead of giving them a rope for getting out.

I&#x27;m not the one to decide what he can to in his time. There&#x27;s be a number of legal issues surrounding that, for example that he can&#x27;t take the current kernel code, but if he decides that within the given framework he closes his development, fine with me. If Linus decides that he thinks that a deep integration between the kernel and systemd is the way forward for <i>his</i> project, I have to accept that.

There&#x27;s certainly a lot of room for improvement - build upon it and create and advocate an init system that is better than systemd in more areas than it is worse.<p>> This is the systemd developers&#x27; M.O.<p>So far I&#x27;ve mostly seen &quot;we believe this is better and we&#x27;ll build it this way, like it or leave.&quot; That&#x27;s certainly opinionated, but hey, they&#x27;re totally entitled to have that view (why would they build it if they thought it&#x27;s worse?!) My view and your view may differ, but we don&#x27;t get to complain unless we provide something that we think is better and get a lot of people to agree on that.",1416418743

If you then drag yes-drop and go back to dragging the no-drop this then appears under the yes-drop div.<p>This is because before dragging, there&#x27;s no CSS transform style. After dragging the transformation causes the element to be rendered above its siblings. Then when the other element is transformed it is then rendered above. I&#x27;ve added<p><pre><code>  transform: translate(0px, 0px);
</code></pre>
to both elements to fix that.<p>> Also I don&#x27;t get what causes the highlight of the drop zones to activate. Percentage of shape? Center of Shape? Personally I prefer that it is the mouse pointer that activates the enter / leave and not the shape itself.<p>It&#x27;s mentioned in the JS code comments<p><pre><code>  interact(&#x27;.dropzone&#x27;).dropzone({
      // only accept elements matching this CSS selector
      accept: &#x27;#yes-drop&#x27;,
      // Require a 75% element overlap for a drop to be possible
      overlap: 0.75,
</code></pre>
You could instead set overlap to &quot;pointer&quot;.<p>> Added: If you drag the yes-drop from the side to enter the drop zones, the outer zone looks like 50 pixels wide and yet the error or margin to drop it in there is about 2 pixels before you enter the inner zone.<p>The deepest dropzone element in the DOM gets drop priority if the element/pointer is over multiple dropzones.",1416418740

And all applications that unnecessarily depend on said system? That would require millions of dollars, at least.<p>Yes, indeed, I do. Because most applications will not <i>unnecessarily</i> depend on systemd, but rather because the dependency provides some (perceived) benefit to the developers. And if the developers decide that the benefit is worth the dependency, they&#x27;ll do it. And if you want to prevent that future, you need to provide something that offsets the benefit - write the test and compat code to support gentoo, write the docs, provide the money (or other incentive) for the developers to do so. That&#x27;s how it works. You don&#x27;t have to do all of that yourself, you can form a group, build your own distro, run a fundraiser, whatever you choose. But you don&#x27;t get to sit back and complain and hope the world changes for you and neither do I.<p>There&#x27;s no democracy in the OSS scene, users don&#x27;t get to decide what the software they use looks like and even maintainers or other software have no vote. It&#x27;s more like a market - we use what&#x27;s best for our personal cause.

A router that only allowed string route definitions would be faster but far less useful.<p>I can&#x27;t explain away the recursion, though.  That seems wholly unnecessary.<p>Edit:  Actually, I figured that out, too.  You can put middleware in a router so it only runs on certain URL patterns.  The only difference between a normal route handler and a middleware function is that a middleware function uses the third argument (an optional callback) and calls it when done to allow the route matcher to continue through the routes array.  This can be asynchronous (thus the callback), so the router has to recurse through the routes array instead of looping.",1416417105

8631165,comment,8629895,8629895,0,0,pjungwir,,,"As a &quot;talented&quot; person who believes intelligence is mostly trying, I&#x27;m thrilled to see these ideas appearing so often on HN and in the culture. I ran into this idea in a striking way while reading a biography of Thomas Aquinas that called him &quot;patient&quot; because he was willing to see the world as it is rather than pushing it to fit a preconceived model. (Whether you agree about Thomas is not really the point.) Likewise a lot of existential and post-modern thinkers have talked about how reason and language forcibly distort reality by losing details. To understand anything you have to sit with it for a while and let it come into focus. And you have to keep poking holes in your ideas to see where they fail, so you can improve them.<p>I think the Aristotelian/Thomistic idea of &quot;habit&quot; is very important to intelligence. Intelligence is a habit of trying. I feel like there is an active and passive part: of verbally reasoning about the thing, but also of sitting back and waiting for understanding to come. You can sort of alternate between the two postures, ratiocination and contemplation, and neither is the same as giving up.<p>My five-year-old is learning to read, and after 10 minutes or so he gets tired and just starts guessing, rather than sounding out the letters. At that point we stop or change the lesson to something easier, because we don&#x27;t want him to form a habit of guessing--or &quot;learned helplessness.&quot;<p>When I tutored calculus in college I often asked students to verbalize how they were thinking through the problem, and I think it helped a lot. Most people fear silence, so it sort of forces them to work through the problem one small step at a time, rather than seeing an intimidating, irreducible, misty whole and giving up.<p>It&#x27;s sort of like chess: to get better, all you have to do is not move until you have a plan, and keep asking yourself questions to poke holes in your plan. Moving just because it&#x27;s your turn will make you stagnate, but pushing yourself to think through just a little more than you feel capable of will make you better and better.<p>In programming one of my pet peeves is &quot;debugging by superstition,&quot; where people rapidly change a line here and a line there to see if it happens to fix things, rather than reading and understanding the code. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with forming a hypothesis and testing it, but at least spend some time coming up with a good one.<p>I think all these things are the same or at least overlapping: patience, perseverance, determination, stubborness, curiosity, optimism.",1416416848

8631162,comment,8628582,8630289,0,0,curun1r,,,"The reason people call it easy is because it makes a lot of things that are traditionally hard very, very easy. One need only have written Chef scripts for any considerable amount of time to appreciate just how much easier it is to write a Dockerfile. And the things that CoreOS/fleet, Kubernetes and (hopefully) EC2 Container Service do aren&#x27;t just difficult to do without something like Docker, they&#x27;re basically impossible. And as much as I like our DevOps teams, the fact that Docker has basically made meetings with them a thing of the past is a truly wonderful thing.<p>That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so frustrating to see developers making superficial forays into Docker and then declare it to be too complex. Yes, the simple and largely irrelevant stuff does get a bit more complex and you have to do some learning (and re-learning) before you use it for a production workload. But that&#x27;s a trade off that a lot of us are willing to make to make the crazy-hard stuff significantly easier.<p>We&#x27;re developers.

Taxi monopolies have formed to enable the drivers a better bargaining position. Uber is achieving lower prices by destroying this, and as we can see, once that is done, nothing stops them from turning the tables and driving the price too low for the drivers to survive. The drivers are not their employees, and so not their responsibility. That is the core of their model. I think they&#x27;re a little more disruptive than needed, basically :)<p>Taxi monopolies easily grow into a problem. They overprice the rides and stifle the market.

Many things have a work around. It is just one of the problems with a language full of tools and little full-time man power.

6536340,comment,6534827,6534827,1,0,alarge,,,"Can someone address the actual usefulness/fit of Haskell as a general purpose programming language for development of complex systems?<p>Most of my career (roughly 30 years), I&#x27;ve been a Unix server-side engineer, writing code in C and C++ with a smattering of Java every now and then.  With my latest job, I&#x27;ve picked up Ruby, Javascript (including Node.js) and Go.  Of the three, I tend to prefer Ruby for small utility code and Go for serious server code.<p>In addition to the relatively clean syntax of these languages (and Go&#x27;s awesome concurrency paradigm), one of the things I really like about the modern crop of languages is the library and 3rd-party support.  Need to talk to mysql?  There&#x27;s a gem/package/module for that.  Redis?  Same. Pubnub?  Same.  Stuff like http is baked into the standard libraries.  Need to implement a high-performance logging subsystem with file rotation based on age or size?  These languages all provide library access to the necessary OS fundamentals to do that.  In short, I haven&#x27;t found very many problems that I could solve in C++ that I can&#x27;t in Ruby or Go (or probably in Node).  And with a lot less effort and (at least in Go or Node) at close to the same performance.<p>I hear the whole &quot;functional programming is better&quot; pitch, and I have very limited knowledge/experience in that area.  What negatives does a paradigm shift from &quot;imperative&quot; to &quot;functional&quot; programming introduce?  Are there some classes of problems that <i>aren&#x27;t</i> appropriate for a language like Haskell?  Are there real-world examples of high-traffic services where the entire backend is built in Haskell?",1381531979

Of course some strawman statement, that you hypothesize that I support, would be seen as laughable by a hypothetical population outside the advertising industry. But let&#x27;s stick to what real people have actually said.<p>Considering that, and looking at my original statement, perhaps I should have said &quot;can be useful for user and advertisers&quot;, like I said &quot;a good ad can benefit everyone&quot;. That&#x27;s a little more clear that there&#x27;s the potential for this, and hopefully less Kool-Aidy.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure this has been stated by actually official company representatives at some point, and I think it stands as relatively obvious, depending on what your definition of &quot;good ad&quot; is. If you&#x27;re optimizing for the short term, and you&#x27;re an ad marketplace, then a good ad is one that sells for a high commission - that is, one that has relative high CTR and bid price for a large total earn. But if those ads are scammy, then users will eventually either not click those ads, not click any ads, stop using the marketplace or the sites that display the ads, etc. So if you optimize for the long term you want users to be glad that they clicked on an ad, so that they&#x27;ll continue to do that over the the long term, and that means making them good for the user. This means that a &quot;good ad&quot; has some usefulness to the user: if highlights a product or service they were looking for, it educates, it offers a good price, etc.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s idealistic, but not overly so. The premise is just that built right, an ad system can produce good results for everyone. Good free content; relatively useful ads; revenue for content producers, ad marketplace, and advertisers; etc. I think this ends up being the case at least some of the time, and it&#x27;s important to realize that it&#x27;s not just by accident, it&#x27;s by design. And it&#x27;s not strictly capitalistic or benevolent, but a case where the two can coexist if done right.<p>Again, no where did I ever say that an ad is better than an organic result. Please don&#x27;t claim that I did. It&#x27;s simply not true.",1381531638

What <i>could</i> make it great though assuming no modification to the game is to treat it like an inverted ThinkPad trackpoint.

Its called Hangul and it is probably the most advanced alphabet humans have right now while also being simpler than most of them at the same time. It can be stacked like Chinese characters, but its also built more like ours with an ability to construct unusual vowel sounds. Get this, it was invented in about 1443 AD and even mimicks the way the mouth is constructed. Thats right, the characters actually look like how the mouth, jaw, and glottis form to make the sound. Its brilliant and a gorgeous piece of work that demonstrates how something simple can also have incredible complexity lurking under the surface.<p>Did you know that Hangul is so good at mimicking other language constructs that some anthropologists want to use it to record near-extinct languages? It takes an average person about 3 days to learn it, whether they speak Korean or not, and they can use it to write down their own language even if its completely different from Korean. Its that universal. Imagine being able to get native speakers of dying languages to actually write down how their language is pronounced. Now thats power.<p>Ill give you a great example. I was walking around Seoul one day and drinking this soda call Pocari Sweat (said so in English on the side). Yeah, it says its got sweat in it but damn it was good. I turn to a Korean woman, point at the Hangul on the side of the can, and ask in bad Korean, Can you say this? She reads each character of Hangul as:<p>poh car ee sw et<p>Thats right, the English on the can was mimicked nearly exactly by the Hangul and it made no sense to her either. But, she could read it and we both said the same exact verbal noises even though we read different alphabets. She thought it was funny too.&quot;<p><a href=""http://zedshaw.com/essays/fortune_favors_big_turds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zedshaw.com/essays/fortune_favors_big_turds.html</a>",1381530937

See how he always lift his right hand thumb to reproduce the same movement, sometimes three times, just to go through the screen (in Civ5).<p>2. Also the fact that buttons get mapped like a &quot;pie chart&quot; on the trackpads could have been a good idea, but we need buttons. We forget the luxury of having buttons with all those new tactile screens because we want more tactile surface, but for a controller we hold in our hands, we need some feedbacks bellow our fingers. This is really a bad idea...<p>3. I&#x27;ll have to admit that it looks like a better alternative than joysticks for FPS games.<p>EDIT: As someone else pointed out, if you get two controllers : a valve one for FPS, RTS, games that works well with it, and a Xbox/PS4 controller for the rest, then it&#x27;s a very good thing.",1381529186
6536177,comment,6531251,6536019,1,0,codexon,,,"> The percentage of females normal drops year by year in the CS programs I am familiar with. This does not seem to be happening at Mudd to the degree it does elsewhere. I have not see you put forward how initial acceptance has changed this trend, or that the trend exists at Mudd and they simply start the first year with a high female ratio say 40%-60% male-female.<p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. The burden of proof lies with you, not with me.<p>> People do switch majors when they are below average, not always but I would be surprised if this reason is rare. Your argument now requires that the females are below average compared to the males but not so below average that they want to switch majors. I would count this as a minor complexity penalty to your argument.<p>This is not complex at all. Switching majors is major decision with many roadblocks. You will need approval and you will likely need to retake courses. This has dire implications such as wasting credits which means you will need more money to stay in college longer. You might even lose scholarships.<p>All evidence points that differences between ranked individuals will be difficult to see. In activities that are completely quantifiable such as Olympic racing, the difference between the top people are measured in milliseconds, so it is quite feasible that the difference between male and female CS students at a selective college is similarly small in terms of absolute measurements.<p>> This by it self does not work at most universities. So what makes Mudd different that this argument works there?<p>What makes Mudd different is that they accepted more females to start with. This reasoning causes minorities to stay, it doesn&#x27;t increase the number of acceptances.",1381529123

Certainly part of the price is supply, which is determined to some extent by mining costs, but there is also the demand side of the equation. You will find demand for precious metals greatly diminished during a recession or any kind of economic hardship. They are a luxury good. Toilet paper, on the other hand, is an inferior good whose price will not be affected by any economic hardship. In fact, it may even increase during such a crisis.<p>Buy toilet paper.",1381529019

They made a call, it was the wrong thing to do, so they've listened to feedback and have now gone another way.<p>What's the problem?

There's nothing more depressing than one of those run-down unrenovated malls that nobody bothers to visit any more, half empty and half filled with shops selling china statues of dogs. Now imagine a world where even the nice malls look like that.<p>I'm probably over-extrapolating, of course. The reason I hardly ever buy online is that if I've already decided I want something then I'm willing to throw in a few extra dollars to get it now rather than later. I can't be the only one who feels that way. There are some things which will continue to be much easier to buy instore than online.",1340027900

Also, as was asked above, how are the startup times for multi-gigabyte/terrabyte databases?<p>* Hint for the unwary - if you run a SELECT statement with a WHERE 1=0 AND <rest of predicates> (for brain dead ""dynamic"" SQL generating apps), the initial compilation can take a dramatically long time in Oracle 10g (and I believe 11g, but cannot confirm). Oracle have not got any mechanism to shortcut the query compilation for such queries. A bit obscure, but I never saw this problem with SQL Server. Oracle support were stumped by the issue too and gave me short-shrift (""it <i>might</i> be fixed in an 11g patch... some time"").",1340026026

A prime example of this can be seen in the film 'Exit Through the Gift Shop'. It's a documentary about Banksy, the street artist, or at least it started out that way. Basically, this French immigrant to LA, Thierry Guetta was obsessed with street art, banksy, and filming his every waking moment. He went on a journey to find Banksy, did it, and then was kind of mentored by some in the street art scene.<p>At the end of the film Guetta himself is having this enormous underground art exhibit and famous people like Brad Pitt come! But Guetta is <i>not</i> an artist. It is obvious that he's posing. To say he's emulating his heroes is putting it very nicely. The guy is literally going around an abandoned warehouse throwing strange shit together for the sake of it being strange, calling it art, and then people eat it up going so far as to say he's a genius.<p>The point is, there was no context. It was strange for strange's sake but it got labelled as art. Everyone is an artist. We all have the ability to be creative and make our own art. That cannot be debated. But what can is how much of it really deserves recognition and what criteria does a work of art have to possess before we can hang it in a gallery and say ""that's <i>real</i> art""? For me, real art has a message, it has skill, it is intentional, and the artist puts a genuine piece of themselves into it that you can just really sense. But I digress...<p>I highly recommend the film, it used to be on Netflix.

The subject did not suddenly explode from nascent form to real subject due to Williams' efforts.<p>Summary: Without the theoretical foundation of Chua people would have gone on for much longer finding the same concept in different guises without realizing that these were really just aspects of the same phenomenon. In addition, there are those who claim priority on HP's underlying tech and there is even a paper publishing similar experimental results as far back as the late 60s which the HP team did not cite. Again, if this was due to mere ignorance then the unifying power of theory to carve a template so that experiments did not continue to be repeated blindly strengthens the value of Chua's work. There is also criticism for the currently liberal labeling of what constitutes memristive behavior and HP is implicated in trying to do a patent landgrab.<p>If one person's work had to be picked as the inflection point then it would have to be Chua.",1340025027

4126212,comment,4124275,4124783,5,0,astine,,,"I think that there's a difference between art today and art a hundred and fifty years ago and I think that it's deeper than you suspect. In the Middle Ages, scholars believed that beauty <i>was</i> representational. They believed that something was beautiful exactly to the degree it represented (religious) truth. The more one depicted virtue in art, the more beautiful that art was, and effective representation was just one aspect of that virtue. The purpose of art was to make this virtue more accessible to the common people.<p>Fast forward to the beginnings of modern art and what we have is people like Monet and Van Gogh who demonstrate that aesthetics are necessarily tied to photo-realism. This leads to an eventual explosion is aesthetic experimentation, much of who's purpose was not any expression of the 'truth' but rather experimentation for experimentation's sake. As time goes on, the art community develops a tight feedback loop which ultimately leaves behind the idea of <i>clarity</i> in favor of <i>novelty</i> and ultimately forgets about accessibility which used to be one of arts most important attributes.<p>Art as experimentation isn't a bad thing, but it's an attitude that is radically different from that only a century and a half ago. People of a conservative bent often miss the old attitude and you'll notice that when the Right-Wing governments of the 30's took over, the first thing they did was resurrect it. (Ironically, the Soviet Union also did this.)",1340024905

When people acquire excess money, they rarely put in under a mattress. They don&#x27;t need it right now so they enter into a transaction with someone who does need it in return for more money later.<p>For example, when a &quot;hoarder&quot; puts money into a bank account, the bank doesn&#x27;t just stare at it. It lends it to someone who needs money now. The bank gets paid back interest and some of that goes to pay interest to the &quot;hoarder&quot;. Obviously, this is a simplification, but the idea is the bank is an intermediary that matches people who want more money later with people who want money now.",1403743586

Same with capital and technology. And they&#x27;re both relatively tricky to track down.<p>Land taxes satisfy 1) and 3), so I&#x27;m all for them, though they&#x27;ve fallen out of favor.<p>But what seems best of all is carbon taxes, up the whazoo. As high as you can set them.<p>There are two countervailing tendencies: carbon is a deadly pollutant, and fuels that emit carbon as a side effect of use are essential to the functioning of society. A carbon tax lets you straddle that: at low levels you&#x27;re taxing a negative externality to discourage it, which is pretty much creating free value (in the same way that government reducing crime creates value). But, to the extent that fossil fuels are absolutely necessary to the functioning of society, their use is inelastic: at higher levels, an increasing proportion of the tax would be passed directly on to consumers, so the tax is minimally distortionary once you hit that inelastic area.<p>Best of all, domestic production is very easy to hunt down and tax: a couple dozen very large corporations handle the vast majority of fossil fuel extraction, so you simply track them down and have them all write you a very large check once a week. The only real trickiness is handling rebates for domestic exports and tariffs on foreign imports--the implementation of which would make or break the scheme--but that&#x27;s surmountable.<p>Set a sky high carbon tax. Make it revenue neutral by setting the tax&#x27;s revenues equal to the costs of abolishing capital gains and corporate taxation, which are not as economically efficient as a carbon tax and double as a sweetener to Republicans and the Chamber of Commerce. The USA and world end up a whole lot richer.",1403742483

Because we operate a service used globally, there is a less-than 10% difference in usage between so-called &quot;peak hours&quot; and “non-peak” hours. We scheduled maintenance for this time because it was not a peak time, but moreso because this period has high coverage from relevant engineering teams, should issues arise. By performing maintenance during this period, we were able to react more quickly and muster those teams within seconds.</i>",1403741122

[from nostromo&#x27;s grandchild comment] My question is simply: why use asset buying as a vehicle for injecting money into the economy and not cash to citizens?</i><p>Because when the Fed buys bonds, it <i>temporarily</i> puts cash into the economy, but sending people checks would <i>permanently</i> increase the money supply.<p>If inflation gets too high, the Fed can sell off its bonds, destroying the money it created to buy them. And even if it doesn&#x27;t sell its bonds before they mature, the income on those bonds—the payments of interest and principal—is a cash flow that represents a slow, steady destruction of the money the Fed created to buy them. In this passive way, the Fed is already gradually undoing its quantitative easing, and has been doing since it scaled back its bond purchases.<p>(The Fed&#x27;s profits—i.e., money beyond what it created to buy the bonds—go to shareholders and the federal treasury, so exactly as much money is destroyed as is created by the time the bond reaches maturity, by the way.)<p>A permanent increase in the money supply, on the other hand, would almost certainly show up as inflation at some point.",1403740954

7947447,comment,7943303,7944579,4,0,kevingadd,,,"Yes. At present if you want a jsperf test to be remotely accurate:<p>1) It shouldn&#x27;t exercise the GC. GC pressure totally skews jsperf results in a way it can&#x27;t compensate for.<p>2) It should compute a result on every iteration that is checked at the end to make sure it is accurate. (This ensures that the compiler can&#x27;t optimize out unused results from your benchmark loop)<p>3) The check should have actual control flow so it can&#x27;t be ignored.<p>It&#x27;s also worthwhile to warm all your test cases once in the setup portion of the page before the loop runs. Some performance issues only appear once you&#x27;ve passed multiple argument types into a function, so if you run a test case that passes in ints, and then run a test case that passes in floats, the second test case will be slower for no obvious reason. You can swap the test cases around and the second run will still be slower.<p>(There are actually a huge list of problems with javascript microbenchmarks, and jsperf only adds to them by being low quality software. Please use it sparingly.)",1403740831

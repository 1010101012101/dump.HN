For example, including a backbone.js collection/model definition in the server-side node environment <i>and</i> serving the same model code to the client.  The controller-y stuff will be different on each: on the node server the model is persisted by overwriting backbone.sync backbone-redis, and the client could choose to do local caching by extending the sync function with a localstorage plug-in.<p>For the client-server communication, by default backbone.sync on the client uses restful cruddy urls (for rails), which would need to be handled in a node.js router.  There's a lot of boilerplate-type stuff out there to help handle routing those urls, building on e.g. express.js. It seems to be more straightforward on rails which already established conventions.<p>That's probably why a lot of the backbone/node demos and tutorials forego the restful server interface.  Its simpler to just do client-server communication using a real-time pipe like socket.io (which itself is shared code on the server the client).  not restful but comes with an added wow factor.",1328335111

Split the code base into purpose-specific modules, just as you would split any project into purpose-specific modules. In fact, those two things might well line up 1:1.<p>If a project depends on other projects, have it reference the other projects. Where appropriate, include exact version numbers and/or commit hashes. Gemfiles are good examples of this good practice at work.<p>Yes, git has submodules for this sort of thing, but after investigating that route, I decided against using git submodules. Use something independent of the VCS instead. Then git won't do weird or unexpected things when you switch branches. Also, you might want to mix in projects that use other version control systems. And really, why unnecessarily couple a project to its version control system?<p>If (when?), even after splitting a megaproject into manageable subprojects, these performance issues creep in, I'd certainly be interested in whatever improvements people are coming up with...",1328334839

3550405,comment,3546738,3546738,1,0,fingerprinter,,,"I believe this is quite true. I also believe that the loudest members of the community (or work, family, politics etc) are the ones you should never, ever listen to. The loudest people tend to get the attention, but I firmly believe you should not indulge them and create a broken system where the loudest, most obnoxious people start calling the shots.<p>This is particularly why I like Ubuntu these days. It seems they have a vision and are sticking to it. Most current Ubuntu users are going to be quite happy, but there will be a few very vocal community members who are essentially caught in a ""who moved my cheese"" scenario and they will be quite loud. Unity is turning out to be the best DE in all of Linux and they are doing something different, bold and it is clear there is a unified vision there. Had they listened to the community, they would still be doing GNOME2 for the next 10 years and the status quo would remain...no movement, no growth, no real innovation.<p>Another community that seems to get it right, as much as I am not a fan of the whole community, is Rails. DHH made some tough calls (Coffescript and not going to HAML and Rspec) and there were quite a few people who hated those decisions, but DHH either had a vision or made a random call (hard to tell in his case) and stuck with it. Seems to be working out for them.<p>And, lastly, Apple. I really, really dislike Apple these days. I think they are going Evil pretty quickly. BUT, they stick to their guns when everyone else tells them they should be doing something different. Let other people build mac hardware? Open up iPhone/iPad development off Macs? Flash on the iPhone/iPad? App store taking 30% from in app purchases?<p>Overall, I think the message is this: Have a vision, understand what you are doing and execute to your vision. You might be right, you might be wrong, but you can't please everyone so know what you are trying to do and do it. Hot or cold but not lukewarm.",1328334737

3550402,comment,3548445,3549088,5,0,codeonfire,,,"You're absolutely right and I know exactly what you are talking about.  There is a crisis in software management and the people who run corporations don't and won't understand it.  The problem is that lots of non-engineers want big money and are good enough bullshitters to get in over their heads.  You get one in at a high level and of course someone with little to no experience is going to distrust the engineers who spent decades in universities and companies learning the field.  Who are they going to hire for middle management, super knowledgeable trained engineering managers or other non-engineers who share their distrust?  Their distrust is warranted as they are unqualified.<p>The problem is only compounded by the fact that everyone can have a computer while not everyone can design and assemble a nuclear reactor or highway bridge.  Therefore, people easily overestimate their understanding and abilities in being a dev manager.  Add to this the fact that software is paying much better than many other fields including sciences, academia, and engineering and everyone wants in.<p>The fallout is hellish work environments as programmers have to contend with these people (who bring over their outdated interpretation of the management role from their old careers), and a disengaged workforce looking for the exit doors.  Long term this will only drive software costs up.",1328334674

It is the combination of two already existing technologies, but isn't that pretty much what all new technologies are? On top of that it is a new language and each language is going to be better or worse at doing certain tasks. It is also frequently more beneficial to actually learn something for yourself.<p>As for your second point, client side programming (GUI in general) is very event driven so a lot of people coming to node because they have javascript experience have event driven programming experience. And as far as I know (I may just be ignorant of it, and would love to know if I am wrong) there is no go-to text on event driven frameworks, nor has there been anything as popular as node that has been so focused on events besides tcl/tk which there isn't really a wealth of readily accessible knowledge about.<p>Again, I could be totally wrong, but unless you can point towards where someone working with node can learn these lessons I am gonna go on ahead thinking that node and it's community are doing well. There is after all a wealth of community driven documentation and tutorials being assembled already. I would hazard a guess that the amount of information available to someone new to node is more robust than many older frameworks/languages/programming technologies in general.",1328332883

Looking at the features Google is toting, I can't help but feel underwhelmed:<p>- Single Request per Connection.  It seems that HTTP 1.1 already addressed this with pipelining.<p>- FIFO Queuing.  I feel like the client is in a better position to know in what order the page needs to be rendered than the server.  Why shouldn't the server respond in the order that the client asked for?<p>- Client Initiated Request. Wouldn't it be better inform the client of what it needs rather than just guessing that the client needs these files and sending them down the pipe?  It seems that this feature might waste bandwidth, when it could have hit the cache.<p>- Uncompressed headers.  For slow lines, compressed header might be nice if they were very large.  That said, I think a better solution to compressing data is to not send it at all.  (If you want to increase speed, do you REALLY need to send the User-Agent and Referer at all?)  The smallest data is the one that isn't sent.<p>- Optional data compression.  SPDY is forcing data compression?  That seems wasteful of power, esp. for mobile devices when sending picture, sound, or video data.<p>Of course, this list is all just blowing smoke until its actually tested.  However, I couldn't find an independent study of SPDY performance.",1328332761

Luck you can deal with, you know its isn't going away.

I guess we just disagree on whether a somewhat steep one-time cost is worth it.<p>I also recognize that it is <i>horrible</i> for serious Java development. I found it fine for browsing through random (usually undocumented :p) libraries, but when I had to use Java myself it was horrible. I ended up doing a bunch of things in Eclipse. Ultimately I solved the problem by not using Java :) Not a viable solution for everybody, but I think it beats the alternatives. (Unfortunately, Emacs's support for Java has gotten worse over the years, unless I missed something when trying to set it up in the past.)<p>My experience with IDEs and screen space has actually been the opposite: Emacs expands to fill all available space while IDEs tend to be much less efficient. I have all the UI frills on Emacs turned off (file bar, menu bar, scroll bars, flanges...), run it full screen on a 1920x1080 monitor and <i>still</i> don't always have enough space for everything I want. Of course, I tend to have one or two files, one or two shells, a dired buffer and maybe even Jabber or IRC open at one time, so it's doing more than an IDE would.<p>Additionally, in my experience, it's the IDEs that lack the features I want. I am basically <i>addicted</i> to TRAMP: I have maybe 10 remote buffers to three different servers open <i>right now</i>. However, the thing I miss most is elisp: I am able to add features I want <i>really</i> quickly. When I'm missing a nontrivial command (say, open a shell in the current directory, set its prompt and name the buffer) it literally takes <i>minutes</i> for me to add it. Little things like C-u Space (which lets me go to the last place I've marked) and undo-in-region are also extremely awesome.<p>As far as things like the Speedbar go, I just don't use it: I see no advantage to having something like that, and I basically never use the mouse anyhow. I do use tags, and they are useful--didn't you say you liked jump to definition?<p>I think the main difference is in languages: I primarily use Haskell, JavaScript and Python with a smattering of lisp, Perl, LaTeX and bash. In the near past I also used Gosu (before the IDE plugins worked, if they do now) and C. Emacs is great for all these languages on top of being both a brilliant editor and great window manager/os (I seem to do everything but browse the internet from Emacs these days).<p>It really is horrible for Java though. And Java is particularly horrible without an IDE. Still, for quite a lot of other languages, it really is like an IDE. I guess not very many Java hackers use Emacs and not very many Emacs hackers use Java.",1328332115

Consequently, people think Harvard is the place to go not because they think Harvard grads have the prestige of being particularly smart (like say MIT grads have for CS or Julliard for music) but for being particularly well connected - something that everyone else has to bust their hump to build up happens by default at a place like this.<p>If the startup community (and well established, famous former startups like Google) <i>only</i> recruited from state polytech schools, those would be the hot schools to attend. Consequently, no-name schools like New Jersey Inst. of Tech would suddenly be full of startup minded people.<p>If those schools suddenly started charging $50k/yr for tuition and boarding (instead of the in-state tuition), that would select for people with money or access to money.<p>Make the admission process highly competitive and selective (GPA >3.8, SAT >1400 or parents donate a library wing).<p>Now NJIT is full of startup minded tech people with money. Add that up and you achieve the same thing that Harvard does for MBAs and Lawyers. Well connectedness with people who have the means to approach and achieve what they want.<p>There is no doubt that the education one receives at these places is also adequate to the task.

I loathe bike lanes, and segregated paths in the US, from what I've seen, also need help. If they're open to use by pedestrians, you'll always end up with people walking three-abreast taking the entire path, or people with mile-long dog leashes made of clothesline-esque material, among other ridiculous hazards. Physically separated bike lanes don't solve many problems, really. They cause quite a few that've already been mentioned here.<p>Education and good on-road bicycle routes would probably do a lot more for bicycling.  A example of a good bicycle route would use residential roads with low speed limits and traffic calming devices. Intersections with arterial roadways would have traffic signals, and you might run into bike/ped-only accessible things, such as a pair of back-to-back cul-de-sacs connected by a sidewalk or no-through roadways obstructed with bollards to keep rat-runner motorists at bay while allowing others the ability to pass through.<p>This would keep cyclists on the road where they belong, but off the major roads where they cause frequent irritation among impatient motorists.<p>Then, education will be needed to teach cyclists a few things that many seem to easily forget:
* Traffic rules apply to all users of the road
* Bike routes exist that might add a little distance to your trip in the name of comfort and safety.
* Be seen, FFS. All it takes is some cheap blinkenlights and a light-colored t-shirt or jacket.",1254933764

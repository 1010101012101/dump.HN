4542166,comment,4541871,4541871,1,0,davidjohnstone,,,"> So the question is, if a 4-inch 16:9 display is better than a 3.5-inch 3:2 display, why hasnt the iPhone been using 4-inch 16:9 displays from the start?<p>How about: Apple got this wrong?<p>To be fair to Apple, if they came out with a 4"" or 4.5"" back in 2007 it would have strangely large compared to everything else on the market (not to mention having the properties Gruber also mentions). The 3.5"" screen made perfect sense then. However, what Apple didn't do was foresee that most consumers would prefer larger screens, and this doesn't fit with the Apple ideal of One True Resolution. (Yes, now there are two resolutions for iPhones, but only the vertical resolution has changed.)",1348030713

My primary criticism of my 4S echoed Edward Tufte's words here:<p><i>Last year in Cupertino, I yelled at some people about touchscreens that paid precise attention to finger touches from the user but not to how the device in turn touches the hands of the user (and produces divot edge-lines in the flesh).</i><p>Those creases between the antenna bands and the glass back combined with the 4S's weight were very noticeable the first time I held the 4S for more than 5 minutes and through the first week I had it.  It faded completely fairly quickly and I laugh about it now but I have to think one of their major goals with this iteration was to erase that defect.<p>People seem disappointed every time Apple doesn't come out with a total redesign but total redesigns are basically admissions that what you were shipping last week was totally wrong.  I have to think that a unibody metal frame is what they've been shooting for all along.  They couldn't work the antennae properly so they settled on a lot of plastic and then glass and finally they got their unibody aluminum chassis.  I wouldn't be surprised if by next year they completely remove the glass inlays on the back and move to liquidmetal alloys.",1348030473

4542130,comment,4540719,4540719,2,0,cletus,,,"I remain skeptical that fusion will ever be an economical or even viable source of energy. The major problems are that:<p>1. The Sun, by comparison, produces less energy (per volume) than compost [1];<p>2. Heavier isotopes of hydrogen, used because they provide a faster reaction, emit more neutrons, which tend to have a devastating effect on the container. Thus you have two conditions at odd: speed of the reaction vs viability of containment;<p>3. The Sun solves the problem of containing the reaction with gravity. Magnetism has yet to yet to be shown as viable of effective in energy terms; and<p>4. People focus too much on the fuel cost, which is near-zero and supply is effectively unlimited. But that's H1. Deuterium is relatively plentiful [2] but tritium is one of the most expensive substances (by mass) on Earth. Helium-3 is an alternative but is also incredibly expensive [3] such that recovering it from the Moon may actually be economically viable relative to cost (that should tell you something about how rare/expensive it is). D-D reaction research I think is currently far behind anything involving Tritium or He-3.<p>Fuel costs aside, that's only one input into the cost equation. Even if the fuel is free the power plant will cost $X to produce, will require $Y in maintenance per year for Z years and produce W MW of power. Plug all those numbers together and that power still has cost even with ""free"" fuel.<p>For automobiles at least, petrochemicals have some incredible advantages. They are relatively stable, cheap and the machinery for turning them into usable energy is cheap and mass-produced. Of course it has two major problems:<p>1. Emissions; and<p>2. It is a limited resource.<p>I tend to think at some point in the next few centuries genetic engineering will allow us to solve (2) by sustainably ""growing"" more fuel with something like algae or (to borrow an idea from Anathem) ""fuel trees"". Of course something must be consumed to produce this energy.<p>Battery technology will have to improve by an order of magnitude at least to be a viable alternative to fuels that are easily transported and don't require the infrastructure that charging stations otherwise would.<p>For fixed power generation I'm really not sure what the future holds. If we're not careful we'll simply exhaust a number of readily available fuels and the population problem will ""correct"" (as it often does) with war.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2012/04/17/3478276.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2012/04/17/3478276.ht...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.ccfe.ac.uk/FAQ.aspx#Depletion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ccfe.ac.uk/FAQ.aspx#Depletion</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium-3#Fusion_reactions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium-3#Fusion_reactions</a>",1348029847

IBM was doing this before there was a Microsoft and before there was a WWW.<p>If you amass enough vague patents, any one of which on its own isn't worth the paper it's printed on, then automagically they no longer remain worthless.  Suddenly you have something valuable: a patent portfolio!  This is because it costs a significant sum to pay someone (e.g. a patent attorney) to go through your wonderful portfolio of junk and determine which ones are worthless.   And that is in turn because patent law firms charge very high fees to do that work.  And that is in turn because not every lawyer is permitted to become a patent lawyer - so there's only a limited number of patent lawyers - hence they have less competition to drive prices down.  The uncertain validity of a bundle of patent claims that I can allege others are infringing is the value.  Threat == value.<p>Therefore if I have several hundred vague patents of which a definitely large proportion are worthless and I sue you alleging you have infringed a significant number of them, you are screwed.  Because it is going to cost you a lot of time and money to have someone go through each and every claim and convince me you are not infringing.  So you just concede it's not worth it to fight me and my deep portfolio of junk software patents.  And we start negotiations.  Needless to say everyone at the negotiating table is not going to be in a happy mood going into this given that we had to start the whole process off with threatened or actual litigation.

One, your time is wasted closing it and going back. Two, the advertiser may have to pay extra for a useless click. Three, Google (for instance) has to consider the likelihood that this is a useless or fradulent click, and possibly reimburse the advertiser if so.[1]<p>All of these are bad for Google (for example). The offset gained by a few dollars in revenue is probably not going to counter that, because what they really want is users to continue using their search engine and they want advertisers to be happy with the clicks they pay for. Those are really important for them to keep. Tricking you into clicking useless links is bad, bad, bad.

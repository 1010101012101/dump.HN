The problem with this strategy is that, at some point, having a string of 6- to 18-month job tenures starts to look really bad.<p>The second is even more tricky. Most people aren't in the position of being able to ""refuse to work on"" bad projects, especially since it's obvious what the person's doing. It seems like this is a recipe for getting fired (which may help a person's career in the long run by preventing a rut, but is something most people would rather avoid).<p>On top of that, there's the even harder question of how to know that the direction a project will pull a person's career in the first place. It's rarely obvious. Sometimes, doing the grunt work makes a person more trusted and puts him in line for the best projects. Sometimes, it leads to more grunt work and otherwise goes nowhere. These depend on the individuals involved and it can't easily be broken down into simple if-then rules.<p>The strategy that most people seem to follow is to change jobs frequently until they find a fit. The problem with that is that, although the ""job hopper"" stigma is much less severe than it was 20 years ago, it still exists.<p>""[P]erhaps most importantly, understanding how connections are really formed""<p>How <i>are</i> they really formed? There are a lot of pet theories on this one, but it's not clear which of them (if any) is right.

The problem isn't cloning the key, the problem is that you are reprogramming the lock to accept this new key you happen to have with you. No amount of crypto is going to save you when your verifier is full of holes.<p>You can't even use signing to only accept approved programming devices since OBD regulations enforce it's openness.<p>> all communications over an open bus<p>Now this is an interesting point. The bus that the OBD is connected to controls a whole bunch of devices all over the car. It's possible that no access to the inside of the car was required to execute this attack. Looking at the video it doesn't seem like they really stoop inside the car to grab anything actually so perhaps there's a way to get at the CAN bus via the presumably electronic wing-mirror?",1341828646

Up to then, more money brings more happiness. After that, not so much.<p>The points made here also happily co-exist with using money to keep score of how much you're on the right path etc. The studies referenced are more to do with how you then <i>spend</i> that money, than with how much you actually bring in.

There can be a 10-100x perf difference between C qsort and C++ std::sort because the use of that function pointer kills performance but in the C++ case the sort function is a template in a header file and can be inlined and then further optimized.<p>Thankfully, all major C compilers have at least some link time optimization efforts going on. When link time optimization becomes more widely available, we can finally stop thinking about translation units and use function pointers as much as we like.",1341828438

4217408,comment,4213162,4213926,1,0,einhverfr,,,"You have to define incest.  For some definitions it actually has a lot to do with it.  For other definitions not so much.<p>Certainly SSM has little to do with hypothetical brother/sister marriages.  But what about first cousin marriages?  These are legal in a bit over half the states including California, and in a bit under half the states such marriages are banned as incest.  South Carolina, always an odd-ball, allows marriages of first cousins, provided they aren't double first cousins.<p>Now, what makes this interesting is that sometimes first cousins get married in a state like California and then they move to a state that does not recognize such marriages (I think I read a case from Arkansas).  In every case to date where this has been challenged, the marriage has been upheld, but it isn't clear the new state of residency is required Constitutionally to recognize the marriage.  Usually it is settled on a conflict of laws basis.  The only cases where the marriage has been invalidated thus far (this could change due to Arizona's strange laws, see below) were where residents of a state that banned the practice travelled to another state for the sole purpose of getting married and then immediately returned.<p>Occasionally anti-SSM laws end up colliding here.  For example Arizona passed a law stating that all marriages that could not legally be done in Arizona would be treated as if they didn't exist.  This was done in order to prevent SSM from being recognized in Arizona without specifically singling gays and lesbians out.  So it covers first cousins, etc too.  Well, then the Cooks got divorced, being first cousins from Virginia who had married there and later moved to Arizona before this law was enacted.  The law was ruled not to apply to them on retroactivity grounds (similar to the CA Supreme Court holding that Prop 8 could not be retroactive).<p>So beyond SSM cases likely drawing on incest cases, you have the potential for things to go the other way.<p>If choice of marriage partners is a fundamental right subject to strict scrutiny, then does that mean we hold incest bans to strict scrutiny and only allow states to forbid sex or marriage between brother and sister, mother and son, and father and daughter?  Wouldn't first cousin marriage bans have to fall?  Would infertile brother/sister couples get to (ahem) mount as-applied challenges to such bans?  I think that would be a mess.<p>Also keep in mind that to date there have been a lot more first cousin couples married in the US than there have been same-sex couples, so a lot of the common legal issues have been litigated in an incest context first.<p>Edit:  I <i>highly</i> recommend Andrew Koppelman's (pro-SSM) work on this subject: <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=665701"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=665701</a>  Among other things he looks at how bigamy, incest, and pre-Loving miscegenation cases impact the SSM legal question.

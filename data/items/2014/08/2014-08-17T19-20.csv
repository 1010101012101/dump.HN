Really, when reading  about concept of learning from mistakes (or in case of software self-correcting) not many would find examples of fragile things interesting.  Just because you are defining neologism which have perfectly good equivalents already doesn&#x27;t make it any more compelling. You just fill paragraphs with boring fluff and make reader wonder why the hell you are not jumping to the point already. \nThis is unfortunately also visible in the paper from OP as, following Taleb, about half of it is concerned with giving murky definition of completely redundant term and then telling the reader what it is and what is it not with numerous examples.<p>The author would do well to remove all the references to anti-fragile and Taleb and substitute those with some history of self-correcting software. Maybe try to research who first wrote about it or tried to construct working code. You know, like some information and background about the concept instead of redefining it and then doing a session of mental masturbation over it.",1408305591

Do your own research and understand that nutrition science is still in its infancy.<p>>Ignore EVERYTHING a doctor tells you about cholesterol.<p>Except for triglycerides. Triglycerides are extremely dangerous and strongly correlated to arteriosclerosis. There&#x27;s evidence that triglycerides are formed in the liver when it&#x27;s forced to process fructose.[1] They&#x27;re also implicated in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.[2]<p>Don&#x27;t ignore your doctor telling you about bad numbers, but take his/her advice as to what to do about it with a few grains of salt. Dietary cholesterol intake has little to do with the cholesterol in your blood. [3]<p>>Diabetics take note.<p>I agree with your basic premise that reducing carbohydrate intake can help with various metabolic diseases, but people with Diabetes need to be EXTREMELY careful. Often they&#x27;ve been on pills and injected insulin for such a long time that their body has adjusted and simply stopping the treatment could actually kill them. These individuals have an extremely dysfunctional carbohydrate metabolism and the transition to a low-carbohydrate metabolism is often accompanied by fatigue often called Keto Flu. [4] This kind of benign fatigue mimics dangerous hyper and hypoglycemic events that can require medical attention.<p>Diabetes can be treated by a low-carbohydrate diet, but the transition off medication needs to be supervised by a medical professional familiar with the practice.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3513615"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3513615</a>\n2. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18460922"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18460922</a>\n3. <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/101760834/Low-Carb-Research"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/101760834/Low-Carb-Research</a>\n4. <a href=""http://elowcarbfoodlist.org/the-keto-flu-symptoms-and-relief/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elowcarbfoodlist.org/the-keto-flu-symptoms-and-relief...</a>",1408305383

Meaning that 16 year olds are less likely to account accurately for the consequences of their behavior.<p>Again, you seem to be assuming that when the brain STOPS developing, it does so because it has achieved perfection. It is pretty easy to support the view that adults are far TOO risk-averse, too unwilling to let teens take chances that would benefit them. To claim adults account &quot;accurately&quot; is going a bridge too far. Adults account for risk &quot;differently&quot; and do so in a way that other adults are likely to agree with, but that doesn&#x27;t make it more &quot;accurate&quot;.",1408304773

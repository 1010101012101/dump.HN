I've made about $10,000 over last two years selling an app that is literally 5 images in a tab view. It took me one weekend to make. I know it's not too much, but it feels good in the pocket, the money flows steadily every day no matter what and requires absolutely no maintenance or additional work on my part, ever. There's a lot of low-hanging fruit in the long tail of the distribution.",1326171573

3445759,comment,3443436,3444285,3,0,ittayd,,,"I think that if you put a flag it effectively means removing those features from Scala, because it will declare them as dangerous. If that happens, then you have lost to Kotlin / Ceylon because these languages have an edge on Scala in terms of ecosystem (IDE / hibernate). The only chance Scala has is in allowing more sophisticated language constructs.<p>I think the source of the problem, at least in this blog post, is that extension methods are limited today. They are done with implicit conversion which is limited for obvious reasons I guess (not allowing type A to arbitrarily become B). I think a feature focusing just on adding extension methods is required, even if it makes the language spec larger.",1326171466

It's not that you CAN'T accomplish a bunch of things in Java it's just that it's a pain to do so.<p>When one looks at java they see a language spec and virtual machine dominated by a bunch of people who are resistant to any improvement that might break compatibility with code written in 1994. Those people or their employers also use various capricious tactics to stall anyone else from improving it. It's essentially been left to rot while the owners of the language strip mine the value.<p>When a situation such as that exists I think the word ghetto is the perfect way to describe the ecosystem.

They are using SoundManager2 (<a href=""http://schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/</a>) which will play audio using either html5 or flash (it's great, have used it on a few projects in the past)... I believe it dynamically detects what's available.

He's a member of the ""I have an Ivy League degree, I deserve a job"" a set. Never mind his degree was in history and political science, he felt entitled to a prestigious, high paying job in the worse economy in 70 years.<p>After a 5 month job search without a callback, I stepped in, did a favor and got him an entry level position at a very small PR firm. This was not a ""dead-end job"", he was the first hire at a newly formed company, there was definitely an opportunity for him to grow his career in a highly lucrative field. But, being that he went to NYU and Columbia (notice the name dropping in the article), growth didn't come fast enough for him.<p>We accommodated him (time off, flexible hours) while he spent two months trying to find another job.

In the 90s and early 2000s, the music industry was being hammered by things like Napster.  Now, they're finally starting to get past piracy.  But it wasn't Government that saved them, it was iTunes.  It was Spotify and rdio and a bunch of smart entrepreneurs finding better ways to get content to consumers.  iTunes didn't beat Napster and its successors because of the Government, and it certainly didn't beat them because it was cheaper.  It beat them because it was <i>better.</i><p>That's what we tech entrepreneurs strive to do: fix problems.  Companies like Netflix are trying to solve movie piracy by getting consumers the content they want, how they want it.  They're not there yet, but there's massive opportunity awaiting whoever finds the solution.  SOPA won't get us closer to the solution; it will take us further away.  It won't stop piracy, but it will stop innovation.  It will bury entrepreneurs like myself under a cloud of uncertainty and legal costs.<p>Right now, sitting in a class at Stanford or MIT, there's a nerd who will figure out a way to solve piracy and get filthy rich and create thousands of jobs in the process.

From the article,  it seems he spends most of his time travelling, relaxing with other expats, and teaching students that are excited about English. As for myself, most of my time is consumed by studying Chinese (a Mercer-like feat), work, and meals with friends (the cheap food costs make dinners out an everyday occurrence, not a once a week treat).<p>Despite the differences, we both seem to possess the same feeling that life in China possesses a relaxed quality that is hard to find. Even though banks, train tickets, and anything requiring an ID (for instance, internet cafes) can be a complete bureaucratic nightmare, day to day life has a certain peacefulness to it. Perhaps that peacefulness stems from the acceptance that the world around you is hectic and chaotic in a way that is at least somewhat hidden in the U.S.<p>Of course, other posters are correct in their assertion that you pay for that life in a number of ways. Pollution, reduced wages, poor internet, drinking water from jugs, hospitals operating while still under construction...But  I for one feel it is worth it.<p>For those who have not, I strongly urge you to visit the country.

But I gave a shot at seeing if I could give code that was succinct and matched.<p>The requirement was to add a method that works for all collections, whether platform or language specific, while preserving type. The code I gave is an approximation of a solution - to use a rough analogy: topologically speaking the code matches but loses the geometry. The code I gave works on basically all .NET collections, whether C# or F#, string or tree - as long as they implement the interface - they are matched.  That it leverages the existing organization should not count against it. The failing is that although types are preserved it is under a new geometry or structure.",1326168600

In terms of interacting with the outside world—e.g. doing GUI work or interacting with a database—you usually have an effectful 'core' that manages side effects while a slew of pure helper functions operate on the data derived from those side effects. (This is good style in non-functional languages, as well, as it is a kind of separation of concerns.) Other functional languages are far less stringent about side effects, so both the ML family and Scheme allow state modification and side effects, although the functional style is preferred when possible.<p>In terms of writing algorithms, you'd be amazed at how little <i>needs</i> to be expressed in terms of manipulation of state. It feels natural to write stateful functions if you've spent large amounts of time programming in stateful languages, but that has more to do with your familiarity than a property inherent in the problem. If you were immersed in Scheme, you might say, ""...a large amount of programming is about function definition and application"", just like if you were immersed in Forth, you might say, ""...a large amount of programming is about stack manipulation."" You certainly could use e.g. Scheme as language for general-purpose programming, and I suspect the problems that would arise would not be problems with functional programming, but rather an unfortunate lack of modern libraries for things like Unicode handling.",1326168320

I've been working in Beijing for the better part of 2yrs and from what I've seen, basically wouldn't suggest moving out here unless you're in it for the long-haul.<p>The ""white-hot"" job prospects the author talks about are mainly for English teachers. If you take a look at the job sites he listed, 90%+ of the positions are English teaching.\nThat is all well and good as most Eng teachers here DO make easy money, enjoy a good lifestyle, and get to explore Asia, but all the while they are really just killing time... most leave after not too long and very few are able to succesfully use it as a channel to career advancement/development.<p>The people who should really think about moving East are those who have developed some real skills & experience other than just being a ""Native English speaker"", and know there will be some kind of deep-relationship with Asia throughout their careers. I would think that these people are likely to learn the language, stay longer, and do a lot better.<p>For CS grads or people in tech, if you make the move to one of the larger int'l companies you can  make up to 3/4 of the salary back home and live a better lifestyle, AND end up saving more.<p>Again, like other's have said, it's not for everyone, but for some it can be a great move.",1326168043

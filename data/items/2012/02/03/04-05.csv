3545842,comment,3544490,3545709,2,0,chacham15,,,"Honestly, I like the Mac because of its hybid GUI/command line nature. However, I also feel like it is the most restrictive OS that I have ever used. What I mean is that it actively stops me from doing things that I want to do. That is not to say that I cannot do them, just that the OS makes it harder. Some examples include showing folders like /usr in Finder and updating command line tools like autoconf (the easy way would be the linux way: with apt). I am making an application which will be primarily on Windows (where the market is) but making it cross-compatible with Mac for the singular purpose of using Valgrind. In any case, the project is entirely Makefile based and works on both Mac and Windows (with the help of cygwin).",1328245153

3545840,comment,3544775,3545544,3,0,arthurbrown,,,"The problem with ""introducing"" metaprogramming is that you first have to have a solid understanding of the language itself in order to manipulate it. From your examples in the article, I think that anyone who genuinely has no programming experience outside Java is going to have very serious problems understanding even the example you've given. Putting myself in those shoes, I have no idea what defun, let, do, when, setf, nth, length, and funcall are. I can  assume they must be function names because they seem familar, but that still doesnt tell me how they should be called, how to give them arguments, what to expect they will return, or even how to know where they're defined.<p>There's no way to teach someone how to programatically manipulate code if they can't mentally parse the code in the first place. Even if you were to completely teach Lisp as a language before introducing metaprogramming you still run into the experience issue. It takes personal experience to understand where and when to use macros. Like you said yourself in the article, most things can be expressed as a normal function. It takes the experience of writing a lot of code to be able to make the judgement of what actually belongs as a macro, and not just a function.<p>I understand that metaprogramming is very exciting because it opens up so many doors, but it's easy to forget about everything that you had to already know to get to the point where it becomes useful. Lisp makes it very easy to repeat this problem because the language itself is so small and consistent. It doesn't take long to get to the point where you feel comfortable enough to try writing macros.<p>It seems that you want to share how great metaprogramming can be and how much it simplifies the work you're doing. That's great, you and I can look at it and appreciate it. But framing it as though it's appropriate for Java programmers as an introduction to Lisp just serves to make Lisp programmers look arrogant, and builds even more resent amongst Java programmers.",1328245106

3545833,comment,3543946,3543946,2,0,Quizzal,,,"We should explore why some people deserve to enter Harvard/Stanford/etc. and why some don't? Part of the reason Harvard graduates are successful have little to do with merit and everything to do with being a ""Harvard Grad"", so it is a self-fulfilling prophecy in many ways. In other words, if we pulled 3 super-hard working freshman from random state schools, and put them through Harvard, and follow them 10 years later, would it surprise anybody that they would end up being successful? If so, what does it matter that their SATs sucked in the first place? Do they not deserve a shot at success as the next person? So they scored ""only"" in the top 20%, because they were hard working dual athletes with a part time job helping out their single parent and no AP classes, so what? Why should they not have the same shot at the Harvard lottery ticket as the kid who's fortunate enough to be born to a ""tiger"" Asian mother or well connected blue blood parents?<p>It's clearly a racket, this whole Ivy/Stanford system where grads from such schools receive the benefit of the doubt when it comes to employment.<p>By the way, I am such a tiger parent, and it's almost ridiculously pathetic to game this system to a certain degree. Let's see, he is currently enjoying:\n1. Summer computer camps\n2. Singing/piano lessons + rock band camp in the summer\n3. Leadership/Scout programs\n4. Private school education with very small teacher/student ratios\n5. Competing on the swim team\n6. Starting a recycling program at his school as his ""entrepreneurial project"" and writing a journal about his experiences<p>Most importantly, the above is very fun for him because he's allowed to enjoy the moment after periods of incredibly hard work. And he just turned 8. The only time he watches ""TV"" is Netflix on the iPad in the car while we shuttle him between activities. This is the new normal, and what I'm doing is what all the other Tiger parents are doing to create the ""balanced"" individual.<p>Yes, he goes to birthday parties, yes he has sleepovers, and yes he has lots of friends. But because he's having ""fun"", we are not pushing him 24/7 to be the ""best"" in all these activities, but to simply do his best, as best as an 8 year old is expected to do. Nevertheless, I feel bad for the kids that do not have such supportive parents with the resources to help their children in this way. My son does not deserve success any more than the next child, he's simply blessed that he was not born in the 'hood.",1328244829

As I did my PhD in Denmark (DTU), I naively wrote a robot to download the issues of a well known chemical data journal. In about a week of balanced usage, I went to discuss with our librarian. He had seen my usage, was nice not to talk about it, but told me this: I downloaded more than the entire university in a year and it was not a lot. It means that at that time, they paid a bit less than the $35 per article price.<p>What is really important to notice is that Elsevier are not selling knowledge for most of the scientific communities but influence. That is, you are published, cited, you get ranking and your university reward you. This is what we need to address if we want to have really open access. We need a better way to sell influence to the university researchers and deans.<p>As I am building Chemo <a href=""http://chemeo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chemeo.com</a> a chemical data search engine, I suffer too. It is maybe time to unit and propose a legal, efficient and rewarding way for the researchers to publish their papers.

What we basically need is a parallel DOI system easy to use, able to load all the open repositories and able to accept ""direct"" submissions.<p>We are not going to solve the problem in a year, this is an influence issue, it will take time, years, to really address it, be it by our own work or by ""law"".",1328244319

The only complaint we legitimately have is the corruption of language, if you want to make the argument that the definition of the word was originally 'tinkerer' and not 'exploiter of systematic weaknesses or loopholes' (or even more crudely, digital breaker-and-enterer).<p>If somebody is using a systematic weakness in IP to take down a website, that's within a class of thing, we can call it A. If somebody wants to take apart a device and re-purpose it, that's within another class of thing, we can call it B.<p>So you and I, more or less, consider A as a subset of B. Over here, we define ""hacking"" as B, while the media tends to define it as A. Meanwhile we get up on our high horse, saying that ""real hacking"" is actually B (which, again, encompasses A). But, apart from the corruption of the language, who cares? I think that our reaction to the media calling A both evil, and ""hacking"", puts us on the defensive, because we think of ""hacking"" as B, and as such, to us it sounds like the media is attacking tinkering as dangerous.<p>But that's nonsense, the media doesn't care about, or understand, tinkering. We could just as well change the name of B to ""tinkering"" and dodge any negative connotation. The only reason we stick to ""hacking"" <i>for better or worse</i> (I'm not saying we should run away), is that it's our legacy, in a way.

I almost never see an app crash, the worst offender over the years has been the New York Times app, of all things. I periodically delete it and read the Times in Safari until they ship a new version. My wife OTOH plays a ton of games and sees a fair amount of crashes. I'm guessing games are not as well-tested, but also, more apps will mean more crashes. Crash, BTW, means ""freezes up"". Easy to recover by pushing the button and the phone and the rest of the apps are still fine. The phone itself has only crashed a couple of times over the last three years, requiring a power off and restart.",1328242507

With Linux and Mac is can do pretty much anything without jumping through any hoops. As a web developer you're basically dealing with Linux on the server in most cases and most open source tools are built with Limix in mind as the final destination. Setting up a development environment with just about anything is very consistent and easy on Mac and Linux.<p>Try getting a basic AMP stack running on Windows. It's a pain and full of non standard practices. Even if you've found it easy to do, you probably have to deploy to a Linux environment for production anyway. Being sure everything works when moving from WAMP to LAMP environments can be risky.<p>But, of course, that all depends on the complexity and specifics of what you're doing. Everyone's mileage varies. It's been my experience that Windows is great.. if you're both developing,mtesting and deploying to production using Windows all the way through. Otherwise it's Mac/Linux all the way for me. But again, you can say the same of Mac/Linux. But why would you develop on Mac/Linux only to deploy to Windows anyway?<p>As for Visual Studio, I have Win7 and VS2010 on a machine I use every 6 months or so and I feel like I'm being smothered. VisualStudio wants me to write code in a way that locks me in to the Windows environment and that just not where I belong. I feel like the other platforms' IDEs just get out of your way and let you write code.",1328242171

And I agree this is something that's pretty difficult to measure, probably impossible to measure precisely.<p>I completely agree also that the language can have an impact on the abstractions you choose.  Some abstractions are obvious in one language and obscure in another.  I wouldn't defend Java against a better example than in the original post, it certainly has its weaknesses.  But I find that most examples just show bad Java code, not that Java itself is bad, which is not enlightening and frankly becomes tiresome.<p>On a related note, I think a lot of people underrate the influence of tools on code quality too.  They might complain Java IDEs are a crutch that merely let you work around the language's weaknesses.  I think they're a lot more than that -- when I start working in a seriously powerful IDE for the first time I was surprised how much it influenced my coding.  Powerful automatic refactoring just makes it so trivial to do the Right Thing (give something a better name, factor out a method, etc).

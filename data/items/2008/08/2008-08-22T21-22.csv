- laptop tethering
- good Exchange synchronization<p>Then he spends the rest of the review explaining why the E71 doesn't meet those requirements.<p>Seriously, at one point he says: ""I’ve been desperately trying to get Merlin Mann’s Inbox Zero concept working and you need a great Exchange client, not a 1.0 Exchange client.""<p>Then, two paragraphs later: ""Nokia’s built in Exchange synchronization is very 1.0.""",1219441601

284239,comment,283639,284161,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It's kinda funny how that works...<p>When I was in college and looking for internships, I put about 20 languages on my resume - Basic, Pascal, DCL, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Assembler, PHP, HTML, SQL, CSS, InstallShield, Common Lisp, Scheme, Dylan, Haskell, Ocaml, and Erlang.  After all, I'd written code in all of them, even if ""code"" was just a small 100-line program.<p>By the time I was looking for my first job, I'd pruned that to the C, C++, Java, PHP, JavaScript, Lisp, Haskell, and Erlang.<p>Now, I don't even list skills any more, just what I've done and what technologies I used to do it.  But the list of languages that I consider myself proficient in is Java, PHP, Python, and JavaScript.<p>I used to wonder why it was that adults got so stupid between graduating from college and their mid-30s.  Now I know - it's not that they're getting stupider, it's that their world and the difficulty of problems they face is expanding faster than their abilities.  I feel much, much dumber than I did when I started college - but the program that took me a month then, I can whip off in a weekend now.",1219441238

I've noticed that Python peeps are pretty big on ""show me the code"" anyway, but I think a lot of untapped potential is lost by not having a dead-simple distribution mechanism, as good as Python libs tend to be overall.<p>That's one thing I do like about Ruby; it wasn't always this way, but RubyForge + GitHub (Oh, GitHub!) + RubyGems combine to make for a very fluid feedback mechanism and make good use of The Cloud.<p>The result is that new libs get announced, distributed, tested, and improved by rabid Rubyists rather... rapidly.",1219439959

284212,comment,284192,284192,0,0,gruseom,,,"For a lot of web apps, including the one I'm working on, the JS interpreter isn't the bottleneck, or even close. Basically, anything involving rendering or the DOM is orders of magnitude slower than pure JS computation. So what's the point of optimizing function call and loop overhead? For what real-world apps will this make a noticeable difference?<p>When we ran our app in FF3 for the first time, we were dismayed to find that, after all the talk about browser performance improvements, it had actually gotten a lot slower (especially when scrolling) [~]. As far as I can tell, they're optimizing the wrong stuff. It's possible that our app is unique, but I doubt it. To judge by Google, many people appear to be experiencing the same thing.<p>[~] Safari 3, on the other hand, sped up our app considerably.<p>Edit: The only person I know of who's raised this issue is John Resig: <a href=""http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-performance-stack/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-performance-stack/</a>",1219439298

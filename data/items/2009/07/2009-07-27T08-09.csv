725600,comment,725191,725589,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I would like to change 'industry' to 'media industry', it's not just the record labels that have a problem.<p>The reason why books are not yet as much subject to copying as music and movies is because they're still distributed in a format that makes it reasonably hard to copy them. It actually takes some effort.<p>As soon as books become available widely in electronic formats (not just the select few that you can get for your kindle today, Amazon claims to have 300,000 titles available but there are substantially more books than that) and without DRM the publishers will be right up there on the barricades.<p>I don't think there has ever been a technology as disruptive to established businesses in terms of jobs and dollars as the internet has been to the media corporations.",1248684394

Are there any ECMAscript implementations with good FFIs? Are the good libraries/bindings for writing GUI desktop apps in ECMAscript? Is it possible to get acceptable performance(comparable to Python or at least Ruby, perhaps?) from ECMAscript?<p>If you were writing a desktop app in ECMAscript, which implementation would you use? Would you actually consider using ECMAscript to write a desktop app?<p>Are there any good books or other resources you would recommend on writing desktop apps in ECMAscript?",1248683736

725590,comment,724963,725520,0,0,shrikant,,,"Two main reasons for this, as I see it (having worked in a such a setting for about a year before getting the hell out):<p>1 (internal reason). Large Indian offshoring companies (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCL et al) have a HUGE workforce, and recruit fresh engineering under-grads in massive numbers. All the bureaucracy becomes somewhat necessary in order to manage undertakings of such magnitude<p>2 (external reason). Work-quality-wise, there isn't much difference between contracting work out to a TCS vs Infosys vs Wipro vs whatever else - hence this immense pressure on such companies to cultivate and tout such aspects about themselves. And let's face it, when you're farming out grunt work to code-monkeys, you kind of expect a 'monkey see, monkey do' attitude..",1248683566

But, the magical thinking behind things like ASCAP/BMI isn't going to go away any time soon, despite the fact that the metrics by which those royalties are disbursed become less and less accurate every day and as the old music supply chains die.  The entirety of the industry is bizarre from a modern perspective, not <i>just</i> the record labels and consumer music supply chain.<p>But, yes, the worst pieces of the puzzle are busy destroying themselves as we speak, and better solutions are bound to spring up.",1248683539

Sure, everybody forgets a quote or a comma every now and then, especially when switching languages. But in a compiled environment without an IDE the cost of a syntax error (one more ect cycle) is too expensive to go through so you really spend time learning the language.<p>The ""I suspect it's more that you'll be most productive in whichever environment you know best."" is very true, but once you know then equally well I wonder which will win out.",1248682535

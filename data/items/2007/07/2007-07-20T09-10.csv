35536,comment,35458,35532,0,0,Tichy,,,"By now I am thinking the main feature of Facebook is to give you an aggregated feed of your friends blog postings? That makes sense, although people could just get blogs elsewhere.<p>I understand the benefits of managing friendships, but still it sounded odd if you say you wouldn't even remember some ""friends"" without Facebook.",1184924066

Maybe most founders just live with this paradox without realising?

35533,comment,35015,35380,0,0,euccastro,,,"I know you are well intentioned, but if I'm full of it I'd rather someone told me, preferrably in a respectful but blunt way.  I'll form my own opinion anyway.  <p>I know I took criticism personally and reacted very badly once or twice in the past, so I see your point.  But I realised I was being a baby and grew from the experience.  No speech on humility can make you humble. At best, it will convince you you should be humble, and maybe by acting humble some of it will sink in and stick.  Real humility comes from realising your mistakes.  [Edit:] That's painful at first, but necessary to get over your ego.<p>[PS: Sorry, I drifted into replying to other comments of yours, and the end result may be confusing.]",1184923023
35532,comment,35458,35530,0,0,drusenko,,,"basically, the idea behind that comment is that while I have 10-15 very close friends that I still keep in touch with on a week-by-week basis, there are 290 other friends who I'd love to see, but would probably not think about out of the blue on any given day. <p>it helps me keep track of more people that i want to keep track of, and i can easily see a snapshot of their life to catch up on what they've been doing.<p>while in college, it helped me connect with more people, get the easy questions out of the way (is she single or not?), and connect with people through mutual friends (hey, you know her too?) broken down simply, facebook helped me make more and maintain better relationships more efficiently.<p>there's nothing nerdy about that at all. at Penn State, some of the earliest adopters were the greek scene.",1184922830

(Honestly, probably not)""<p>Maybe it doesn't matter much then...<p>Still, it's stupid that one can't export data from Facebook. I still wish somebody could explain the Facebook craze to me. Any introductory articles available?",1184922185

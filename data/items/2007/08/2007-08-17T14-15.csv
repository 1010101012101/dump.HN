But I don't know enough about FairUse to say what the magic upper limit percentage of quoted material is. <p>You can generally get to the beef of an article without posting more than half.

43467,comment,43463,43463,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"I think this makes sense. I certainly look at far more pictures and videos on Flickr and YouTube than I upload myself. But I do upload to both. <p>But I think the title is wrong. These ratios seem normal to me, not weak.<p>An interesting number would be word count of read vs. written in blogs and comments. My guess is that bloggers have an easier time having a conversation than videos or photos allow, making it more participatory. <p>And on that same note, do you include comments as participation? I think you should, but it doesn't look like they did.<p>",1187362045

43462,comment,43231,43231,0,0,dean,,,"I remember seeing a lot of stories 6-12 months ago that talked about the 1% rule for user-contributions to participatory web sites. 1% create content, 10% interact with it, and 89% pass it by.<p>But according to this fairly recent article from Reuters <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUSN1743638820070418?sp=true"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUSN17436388200...</a>, the percentage of people that actually generate content is even lower. For example, only 0.16% of visitors to YouTube upload videos. And 0.2% of visits to Flickr are to upload new photos. Wikipedia fares better with 4.6% of visits used to make edits. But it's all a far cry from 20% of users generating content.",1187360984

So me being lazy I skipped over all of them...<p>I am curious when Arrington says ""looking for funding"" or ""raising"" does he mean the same thing? If ""raising"" implies that the company is already securing funds then I am impressed. ",1187360927

HotOrNot launched like a month before the NASDAQ peaked, had to go subscription, and then started earning millions a year.  Blogger was started in 1999, laid off everyone in the bust, and then reemerged as the market started warming up.  Flickr did most of their innovation and programming during the bust.  Del.icio.us was the last of a string of side projects done while Joshua Schacter kept his day job.<p>I just read Phillip Kaplan's <i>Fucked Companies</i>, and the one thing that all the dot-com flameouts had was that they took millions in funding and hired hundreds of people.  The one thing that all the survivors had was that they hired no more than a dozen people and had or found a business model that actually brought in cash.  Make more money than you spend.",1187360778

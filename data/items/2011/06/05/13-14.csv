Do I agree with it? No. But it's very far from your claim. There is due process of law.<p>>>All members of Jehovas Witnesses were imprisioned in 2004.<p>The reason for this is because Singapore has a conscripted army. All male citizens are required to spend 2+ years of their lives in service of their country. They are liable to be called up for service any time up till they are 40, or 50 in the case of officers. Jehovah's Witnesses renounce bearing arms and thus their religion is in direct conflict with statute. They are not ""imprisoned"" in the sense of ""rehabilitation"" or ""punishment"". They are confined, so yes there are restrictions on their movement, and are given duties such as gardening, cooking etc. They are free men after they have performed the equivalent length of time as a regular citizen in the armed forces.<p>Edit: typos",1307282339

2622002,comment,2621844,2621984,55,0,rkalla,,,"More or less.<p>1. Sony removes ""Install Other Operating Systems"" option from the PS3 OS.<p>2. Out of frustration at corporate policy for REMOVING major features from hardware/device paid for and owned by millions, the hackers start working.<p>3. Months later, GeoHot releases (what I understand to be) the root private encryption keys for the device.<p>3.5 (forgot this) fail0verflow group circumvents the PS3's security system using this work from GeoHot - <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4loZGYqaZ7I"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4loZGYqaZ7I</a><p>4. Other hacking groups, now with the keys to the kingdom, begin working on hacking the PS3 to allow the installation of any software, not just officially released/signed/blessed releases. This results in a ""jailbreak"" for the PS3, much like what jailbreaking does to the lock-down security on an iPhone.<p>(This is when things start to go south)<p>5. A technique for loading your own software onto the PS3, circumventing the system's security checks comes out.<p>(Now the door to pirating PS3 games is open. Download images, burn the Blu-rays, pop them in the PS3 and play).<p>6. Another hacking group, using some portion of this manipulation, actually manage to get their PS3's logged into the private developer-based PSN network (it's a full copy of the real PSN network specifically for developers actively working on titles that need to test things like updates or addon downloads/installs).<p>7. It is discovered that the PSN-Dev network does not do <i>real</i> credit card authentication before items are purchased and downloaded. So for example, if I work at BioWare, and I'm on PSN-Dev, I can technically download any of the standalone games from the network and play them by entering a credit card of ""111"" or something silly - <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/gx6o4/im_a_moderator_over_at_psxscenecom_the_real/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/gx6o4/im_a_moderator...</a><p>8. The hacking group is able to pull software off the network, for free, and leak it to the web.<p>9. Some point very shortly after this, the real PSN gets the full intrusion.<p>I forget if the two are related or not... I don't recall if the group went PSN-Dev > PSN and that is how they got in, or if there was another group that did the straight PSN hack.<p>That is the gist of the avalanche that started with ""We are removing Other-OS install support"". Different groups piggy-backing on each other's work to retaliate.<p>The endless backlash against Sony seems to have been the result of them going after GeoHot.Then at some point it stopped being about retribution for him and just became the popular thing to do.<p>It is sort of getting old, so unless Sony does something to re-ignite the flames, I imagine the groups will move on in a month or two.<p>[Links]<p>fail0verflow's presentation on how they circumvented the PS3's security (really cool presentation): \n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4loZGYqaZ7I"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4loZGYqaZ7I</a><p>Post supposedly from one of the internal Sony folk during the total media black-out when the network first went down explaining the console-Dev-PSN-network issue: \n<a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/gx6o4/im_a_moderator_over_at_psxscenecom_the_real/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/gx6o4/im_a_moderator...</a>",1307282086

At least it was. It's been a few years since I was there.<p>I kinda view Singapore as the Zurich of Asia. Zurich (and Switzerland in general) is very regulated (although Singapore more than Zurich; there are no rules against chewing gum in Zurich). Both cities are clean, almost sterile, safe and they basically <i>work</i> (public transport and other infrastructure).<p>Some people chafe against what they feel is an intrusion. You see those same opinions about New York where I now live. Some feel that NYC has lost a lot of the ""grit"" or ""character"" that it once had (back when, you know, muggings were common). One wonders at the psychology of danger and character going hand in hand.<p>For those who think Singapore is overly-regulated, which it is, you have to remember that English-speaking countries are pretty much an outlier. In continental Europe there are rules about <i>everything</i>, from how to throw out the trash to have to register with the government every time you move and what kinds of window treatments you're allowed to use.<p>When I worked in Zurich a colleague once described it succinctly: in England (and, by extension, the US, Canada and Australia) you can do whatever you want except for those things that are banned. On the mainland (of Europe) you can't do anything unless it's specifically allowed.<p>While not true in the strictest sense, that delineation that is tantamount to blacklisting vs whitelisting does, at least in my experience, embody a lot of the cultural differences between English speaking and non English speaking developed nations.<p>That guy's wife is Finnish and she found it unnerving in England. She wanted that structure of essentially being told what to do and how to do it (within limits).<p>The only thing I don't really like about Singapore (apart from the weather)--and this is probably true of most Asian countries--is the importance of face time at work. You're expected to be at work a lot even if you're not doing anything. That whole ""appearance of work"" thing and regimented approach to work in general (ie being very much concerned with the process rather than the results) is something that I've always chafed against.",1307279979

There are fairly frequent comments here on HN by other persons advising HN participants who are thinking out loud about how to stay in the United States, and sometimes those comments include advising people to get into a sham marriage. (The link you have shared, which I have repeated here, will be helpful to onlookers who don't know the law on that subject.) That people would even consider getting into a sham marriage to stay in the United States longer, or to enter it for the first time, illustrates the overall worldwide desirability of the United States, and thus the background for the statutory and regulatory changes that have happened in issuing IR1 visas since my wife got hers. It's still my impression, as a former immigration lawyer, that the IR1 is rather a fast track to United States permanent residence and eventual citizenship compared to many other tracks that would-be immigrants pursue.<p>I can well understand any American desiring to stay and thrive in the country where he met the love of his life. I married overseas, and lived in my wife's country of origin for more than a year after our marriage before she ever saw any part of the United States. I feel much fondness for the country where I met my wife, which, like Italy, has thoroughly undergone the demographic transition and is on a trend eventually to decrease significantly in population. The United States, meanwhile, continues to increase in population and to enjoy net immigration in comparison to almost all other countries in the world. So while it is regrettable in individual cases that previous patterns of fraud have made IR1 visas much more burdensome to obtain than they once were, that is not surprising on policy grounds. A lot of people around the world still think that all the requirements you mention as unduly troublesome are not too much to put up with to gain the right to permanent residence and a fast track to citizenship in the United States.<p>Best wishes for always have a country or two in which you can enjoy life together and prosper in your chosen careers.

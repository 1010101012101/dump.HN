I've had apps rejected for comically ambiguous reasons such as ""app is just a website re-packaged as an app"". Right. IMO one can argue this for many apps. I've had apps rejected because ""app doesn't use enough native iOS functionality"" when the app uses the accelerometer/gyroscope and all sorts of UIKit features.<p>The review process is also hilariously inconsistent. I've had re-skins of my own apps, that are live in the app store, that have solid 5-star reviews across 100s of users, that have 100k+ downloads rejected.<p>On a more positive note the Android development experience has been pretty decent so far. Porting a relatively simple iOS app took about two weeks. This time span includes reading the docs, getting a physical device and downloading the app from Google Play.<p>I've been doing iOS development since the start of the app store. However the ""nuances"" like provisioning profiles mess, $99/year fee and painfully long review process are getting really old.",1344697175

For that matter, so is much of the output produced by the US Intelligence Community at large. According to AOL Defense News, The President and his top officials want and will get a single mobile device allowing them to access highly classified and unclassified data wherever they are. The mobility feature is driven by a desire not to be tethered to a desk or a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF). In addition to the obvious benefits of mobility, the digitized PDB allows for a more in-depth and interactive reading of intelligence matters. In the example of the PDB, as the President reviews the nations most sensitive intelligence information on a specialized tablet, he can jump back and forth, click on links to take a deeper dive, see follow-up briefings, review background materials for greater context, view videos, photographs, maps and other visual aids. In fact, the PDB has gone from a static page to an interactive assessment of top intelligence concerns, landing it squarely in a quasi Web 2.0 world for the Intelligence Community. That is not to say that the President is checking Twitter, Facebook or the Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll numbers. Instead, reports indicate the digitized hardware has been scaled way down. For obvious reasons, specific details regarding the hardwares composition and features remain classified.",1344696973

You can easily change this behavior, but it's the default and many people never even know it's set that way. This is different from defaults on many (most?) Linux systems, and so people coming from one direction to the other often become confused about where to put startup information. (I suppose it's not exactly a Linux versus OSX thing. It has more to do with window managers and how you start up your machine. If you log into Gnome, KDE or similar environments though, most terminal windows you start in the GUI are not login shells.

4370168,comment,4369079,4369730,2,0,jrockway,,,"The API is nice, but it is difficult to maintain.  To get encoders/decoders into the string class in the first place, you have to maintain a global registry.  (I suppose you could pass them all to the constructor of the string object, but nobody's going to do that.)  The global codec registry leads to naming conflicts.  If you import a module that globally adds a ""foo"" encoder, then you import another module that globally adds a ""foo"" encoder, now what?  Both modules break because of their dependency on the global name ""foo"".  Because of the details of the codec.register implementation, you can't even catch the conflict at registration time and refuse to load the second module, you simply have to wait until your program returns subtly-incorrect results.<p>Compare this to the scheme where you import codec modules explicitly and just call their functions.  Your imports are lexically-scoped, and if you happen to need two encoders that use the same name, you can just alias one of them at import time.  This strategy can't introduce unexpected errors as your program grows larger, because the side effects are constrained to one module.  It either works now and will always work, or doesn't work and fails quickly while you are developing.<p>Ultimately, people use Python because they want a bit of discipline in their lightweight language.

That certainly makes sense.  Perhaps we need a few more layers of federal and state government programs on top of the ones we have to fix things for everyone without them needing to do anything more than tick a box?<p>Wow... why don't we see the same vitriol against multimillionaire 'founders' who build a company, flip it, then advise others to do the same, all the while claiming it was 'hard work'?  Perhaps because the majority here want to buy in to that myth?<p>Of <i>course</i> luck was involved in my situation - I've had good luck and bad luck.  I've made some pretty stupid mistakes on my own, involving more zeros than I care to count.  But it's not down <i>solely</i> to luck - much of your success or failure is down to how you react, and how you learn from your mistakes.  A big part of the problem - and I had this 20 years ago as well - is that young people haven't had enough life experience to be able to make good decisions - you don't get those until you're old/older.  And very few younger people listen to older people re: advice - I know I certainly didn't, nor did many people I know, and it hurt us all in different ways.<p>Yes, it's all relative, and I'm not 23 in today's job market.  But I have been both variously fired and laid off, deep in debt, and with nothing but a philosophy degree and minor retail and general work experience.  It certainly ain't fun.<p>Even getting a degree - took 6 years, and I worked part- or full-time the whole time - usually multiple jobs (retail, delivery, food service, etc).  I don't typically have a lot of sympathy for students who hit school full time, take out loans for the whole thing, and do not do one lick of 'work' (yes, school is work too, I know) while at school.<p>Unemployement was ~8% during the early 90s recession - we've certainly had higher this time around, so yes, there's some statistical differences, and the numbers are different.  But complaining about broad social/political/economic forces isn't going to do much good for individual people.  This reminds me of the food industry criticism - ""everyone's getting fat!  look at all the stuff they put in the food - we need regulations, etc"".  Yes, regulating food labelling, food ingredients, etc will probably help the aggregate over time, but it won't help me lose weight.  I need to stop overeating, eat better foods, exercise sensibly, etc.  Will that advise help everyone?  No, because most people won't follow it, but it will make a difference to most individuals who put it to use.<p>EDIT:  Should I even have taken this as personally as I did?

No, I don't your theory there is even slightly plausible.<p>And of course there have been other games in similar genres since then, some of which have been very commercially successful. But they've tended to come with obnoxious DRM, DLC and other silliness in an attempt to keep them that way despite the pirates.<p>My question isn't really about those specific titles, it's about innovation. The games I mentioned either defined or greatly advanced their respective genres for a generation of gamers. Where is the next <i>Doom</i>, the game whose basic concept has just never been done before on that kind of level?<p><i>The music industry is figuring out that, unlike the 90's, they can't put out a cd with 1 or 2 hits and expect people to buy the whole thing. So yes, sales are down. How much are they saving by shipping fewer CDs?</i><p><i>Book sales may be stagnant or declining, but units are up, and a similar argument applies: how much of the falling gross revenue is offset by reduced distribution costs?</i><p>Part of the trouble with this argument is that you seem to be assuming that most of the cost of creating and distributing good music and good books came from the physical distribution cost, which obviously doesn't apply in the same way for digital distribution. But that's not really the case.<p>For <i>good</i> music and <i>good</i> books -- and to be very clear, I am not talking about ""high art"" or any such nonsense, I'm just talking about work that is well made -- a large amount of the overall cost is up-front and doesn't change much just because of modern technologies. It's the human factor: having the right team and a well-equipped studio to handle the recording and production for your song, having a skilled editor and qualified proofreaders for a textbook, and so on.<p>Several of my close friends have worked in these industries in various capacities, and they paint a bleak picture of cut corners and cost savings in their industries today. Certainly the books I've bought in recent years myself have been sadly lacking compared to both the editorial quality and production values of a few years ago, and knowing what is going on behind the scenes it's all too clear how that is happening.<p>Sure, there's no excuse for bundling music into ""albums"" any more. Digitial distribution of individual pieces of music and automatic playlists in every media player application make the whole concept of an album nothing but an artificial marketing tool. Likewise the old fixed page sizes and tight page limits for books have little relevance in a digital world.<p>But the content is what's hard. Writing/performing good material, and elevating the results to the level of professional quality, is hard work and requires real skill. This isn't going to change. No computer AI algorithm is going to spot the way a paragraph is phrased awkwardly because it relies on an idea that isn't introduced definitely until three pages later, at least not any time soon.<p>There's a popular anti-copyright cliche that musical performers should just give their work away as advertising and hope to make a living playing live gigs. Maybe that works for those people, but how does a composer or a lyricist give a live performance? How do editors and researchers make a living when everything they do is about information? How does a level designer or the guy who sketches out the concept art for that great end of level boss that comes to symbolise the entire game?<p>The creative industries are vast machines today, and someone has to pay all these people during the creation/production stage of a work if that work is going to benefit from their skills and expertise. If the realisable profits become so small on a work that it's going to be commercially risky to make it at all, what actually happens is often that either it doesn't get made or it gets made without the help of these skilled people behind the scenes and winds up a worse product for it. And as I keep trying to point out, that doesn't help anyone, including the people who enjoy the work (or would have enjoyed it, if it had been better made).",1344694667

While a good piece of advice, using inheritance in this case is just a special case of complecting things.<p>But I've also noticed, and Rich mentions, that complexity (in the sense Rich was talking about) can be hard to spot. The more common the practice, the harder to spot. One example Rich brought up is positional arguments, or using lists to store certain kinds of data. For example: Storing a person's telephone number and name in a list [phone-number, name] complects the two. First, one has to remember the order. Second, if one needs to store, say, the person's address too, one needs to make changes to all the code that relies on the list's structure. A map {:phone-number the-number, :name the-name} does not have those problems.<p>I want to become more aware of, and sensitive to, complexity.

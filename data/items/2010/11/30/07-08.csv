Secondly, you are obligated to be nice to people at work, even if they disrupt you.

The other was a poorly chosen subject line that caused all the wrong people to read one of the most important emails that company had.<p>I can't give out an exact dollar figure for either.  But both were in the 7-8 digit range.  And both took a surprisingly long time to track down because everything <i>seemed</i> fine.  And so the problem sat out there.  And even once we knew that there was a problem, the problem was only discovered by accident.  (But having been through it, twice, I now know that if business just starts drifting downwards, double check what is happening with email.  Again.)<p>By contrast the obvious disasters that I have seen have cost much less.  Surprisingly so.  The database crashed without a proper backup taken in the last 2 months?  OK, we're out of business for a week and a half while we replay all of the logs, but then the email blast we sent saying we were back up attracted more than enough business to make up for the time lost.<p>And the toughest bugs?  Surprisingly cheap.  It took literally months to track down why we had to do a careful dance bringing up Apache or else nothing worked.  Yet despite months of grief the actual cost in lost business was a few hours of downtime at off hours.  I'd be surprised if we lost 5 figures on that.  And the memorable one where you couldn't fill in a particular form if your screen was the wrong size?  I'm pretty sure we lost $0 on that.  (The bug, for the curious, was an invisible div that was in front of the window.  If the window geometry placed it over the form, it became rather hard to fill out said form.)<p>It is a hard lesson that what developers care about and what businesses care about are only tangentially related.",1291103759

Here are my thoughts on what they should change...<p>1. A copy of the cursor line should float directly next to the keyboard.  I am always looking at keys, and I keep having to look away to see what was typed.<p>2. The Return key should not even be on the keyboard.  This, and other potentially damaging keys, should be on the opposite side of the display.  Keeping keys ""together"" is an artifact of mechanical devices that is detrimental now.<p>3. Hot keys to move the cursor by words and characters (to hell with that awkward bubble drag).  And, a gesture to scroll text fields.<p>4. Make keys MUCH larger.  Abandon the qwerty layout and have more category keys to quickly display certain types of keys.<p>5. A pair of horizontally-scrolling lists, similar to a Rolodex, to scroll through the alphabet and show large keys for ranges of letters you plan to use.<p>6. Preferences to turn off or change absolutely all ""helpful"" auto-correction, including a crucial change of default to KEEP what was TYPED, no auto-obliteration.  I easily spend more time backspacing and fixing than this ""correction"" ever saves me.<p>So, next step...how to see this implemented? :)",1291101106

1953402,comment,1953023,1953023,0,0,dasil003,,,"This is certainly a good counterpoint to the highly visible silicon valley status quo, but it's risky.  Deep thinking <i>might</i> be the solution to a given problem, on the other hand it might give you insight a lot slower than iterating on a prototype.  One of the benefits of computers is that experimentation is easier and cheaper than most other technical disciplines, so it's good to be able to whip up some experiments to glean practical information.  Arriving at optimal solutions to difficult problems is not an endeavour that is well served by a monolithic approach.<p>In a way it's the contrapositive of one of my annoyances with TDD.  Sometimes TDD advocates (along with anyone selling a methodology I suppose) get overzealous and start making ridiculous claims like ""TDD ensures program correctness"".  When pressed they may backpedal and acknowledge that unit tests are no substitute for mathematical proof.  But yet there remains a dogged obsession with one particular technique.  Take the experiment of writing a Sudoku solver via strict TDD (<a href=""http://xprogramming.com/xpmag/OkSudoku"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xprogramming.com/xpmag/OkSudoku</a>).  It's obvious that TDD doesn't help you write better algorithms.  It's a good discipline for ensuring test coverage, it gives good sanity checks, and it can even help the modularity of your program, but it sure as hell doesn't <i>inherently</i> lead to better code.<p>So whether you spend years thinking things through before writing a line of code, or most of your time is spent writing and rewriting tests to ensure the perfect coverage, it's always worth reflecting on the effectiveness of time spent and diligently avoid cargo-culting on methodologies.",1291100938

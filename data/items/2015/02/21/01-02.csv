So called geo-fencing by IP only is fuzzy by definition.<p>The copy is licensed since it&#x27;s made available by the distributor to the customer. It&#x27;s the distributors duty to the determine if a customer is eligible for purchase or not, best way would be having to provide a verifiable invoice address within the region of the granted license. An IP is a best guess at best, but not a verifiable proof of the physical location of the end customer. Netflix doesn&#x27;t ask for an invoice address, Amazon Prime does. Amazon also has siloed accounts for each market where you would have to have multiple subscriptions in different countries to access the local offerings, where as NETFLIX has only one global platform. If an US-resident purchases a US-NETFLIX subscription travels abroad for a short or long period it shouldn&#x27;t make a legal difference if a private VPN to the home&#x27;s IP or a commercial VPN service is used.<p>By all enforceable concepts the place of purchase of the subscription is the relevant thing for having a valid license for private use, not the place of consumption.<p>Also I can&#x27;t see why the first-sale doctrine wouldn&#x27;t apply here either.

But I also (already) believe that anti-sex-work laws act to oppress and victimize already-marginalized women, with dubious benefit (without taking a side on whether this effect is deliberate).<p>For example, in my jurisdiction (IANAL), although I understand that prostitution itself is not illegal as such, the following things are illegal:<p><pre><code>    * posting/negotiating prices openly\n    * operating a place of business for prostitution (a &quot;bawdy house&quot;)\n    * living &quot;off the avails&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThis last law is supposed to allow the prosecution of pimps (yay!), but it also means that sex workers cannot hire bodyguards or accountants.  The second law is presumably supposed to keep &quot;decent&quot; neighbourhoods &quot;decent&quot;, but it also results in more streetwalkers, and more liaisons in minimum-price hotels, and so lowers safety.<p>It seems sort of obvious that the right direction is to have better laws, and then enforce them.

Then on top of that the patent monopoly makes the new invention more expensive and discourages third parties from making improvements they can&#x27;t deploy without permission, which reduces the overall value of the invention.<p>We might actually do better to just throw the patent system away and replace it with massive direct public funding of scientific research. The interesting question then is how to decide what to fund and in what amounts, which seems to be the heart of the problem.<p>And there is also another point, which is that maybe scientists aren&#x27;t particularly underpaid, maybe it&#x27;s that managers are overpaid, e.g. because investors in public companies are so diffuse and distant from the companies they&#x27;re invested in that they can&#x27;t prevent executives from paying themselves more than they deserve.

Certainly there&#x27;s money in law enforcement tools, but there isn&#x27;t much incentive for LE to pursue trafficked or underage sex workers, nor are they hard to find.<p>The most common reason I&#x27;ve seen for my friends to be trapped in agencies or abusive pimps has been immigration status, by far.  And nobody is doing them any favours by taking them in.  LE hates the paperwork so much that a decent way to get out of a pickup is to feign being an illegal alien.<p>Underage workers are similarly avoided.  If you&#x27;re 16-17 with no fixed address, it&#x27;s going to be a nightmare of social services for everyone involved before you&#x27;re spat back out onto the street.  (I was arrested twice when underage.  Both times they let me go when they saw I was 17 and a ward of the state.)<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that there&#x27;s revenue here though, because LE just loves to do stings.  Mostly they&#x27;re single moms or otherwise trapped by circumstance and trying to make ends meet with a side gig.  They&#x27;re the ones who go quietly, who plead out, who pump arrest records, etc.<p>Sex trafficking is an immigration/social services problem <i></i>far<i></i> more than it is a law enforcement concern.  Giving LE more tools to track us is going to make things worse.<p>I supported myself with sex work when I was a self-sufficient and independent from 15-19.

IMHO, real audiophiles become sound engineers. There&#x27;s no way you&#x27;re going to have a better sonic experience listening to a record in your living room than you are at the mixing desk or in a live room of a recording studio.<p>Of course good audio equipment costs money, but studios don&#x27;t spend thousands on individual gold stereo cables and such nonsense. If you want to sell me a cable costing thousands of dollars it better have 24 channels of balanced audio, be 50 meters long, and weatherproof. But in terms of just getting quality playback of a quality recording, you can get by fine with relatively affordable pro gear - it just doesn&#x27;t look as nice as &#x27;audiophile&#x27; stuff. This is the real difference. I&#x27;ve done sound engineering for a living for years and also make electronic music, so I have maybe $10k of highly specialized audio equipment surrounding me right now. But it&#x27;s not very aesthetically beautiful, rather it&#x27;s utilitarian and nerdy.<p>There is a pro analogy to this that you can see at shows like AES, hwre certain boutique manufacturers charge out the yin-yang for summing mixers (volume/pan only, no EQ or tonal modification of any kind), as long as they look like they came form the 1950s and have giant chickenhead knobs and so on.

It&#x27;s also that you can believe with a fair degree of confidence, based on a long history, that your 20 year old Rolex will still be a classy piece of jewelry at that time.<p>Whereas even if there&#x27;s some kind of upgrade program to prevent computer-part-obsolesence, nobody knows if smart watches will even be a thing in five years.  Maybe in five years, Microsoft HoloLens will have blown away the smartwatch market to the point that every important wearable is glasses, not a watch.  Or maybe they will be watches, but they&#x27;ll have moved to a snap-bracelet deal where there&#x27;s a much wider screen.  Or maybe wearables will just be dead, dead, dead.  Nobody knows.",1424480730

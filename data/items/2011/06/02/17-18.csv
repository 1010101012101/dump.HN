Somewhere between a Ponzi and a bubble -- economically it's a bubble, practically it's a Ponzi.<p>Most bubbles start by accident -- this one was carefully engineered.<p>How do you engineer a bubble? First you invent an asset. But if it's an asset that only you own then nobody will want to believe it's valuable. So you make it possible for the first round of early adopters to get it for free, by ""mining. The first adopters talk the second adopters into trying it too (they can still get significant amounts by mining) and... well, you know the story. You also wrap it in some political anti-fiat-currency anti-bank anti-Fed anti-government anti-whatever pro-cryptography political wrapping to make it appealing to a certain constituency. But the key thing is to give out the ""asset"" for free at first, and to a lesser extent as time goes on, to incentivise early adopters without requiring 'em to actually put their hands in their own pockets. It's quite brilliant, the best memetically-engineered scam since Scientology.<p>And now I'm <i>really</i> getting tired of discussing bitcoin. I think I'll write a big long blog post in the form of a FAQ, submit it, and never mention bitcoin ever again.",1307037524

2613069,comment,2612688,2612927,16,0,sgornick,,,"Using Bitcoin the way the EFF is using it (giving out a single address for all transactions) will result in anyone being able to see all funds received.  The recommended way, however, is for each transaction to receive its own address.  For example, clicking on the EFF's Donate button would then create an address that would be used only for that one donation.<p>One such innovation that takes advantage of a publicly visible blockchain is an online lottery.  With a public transaction log, one can wager and know that the operator isn't cheating by not revealing all wagers.  BitLotto, for instance just had a monthly draw.  I know exactly how many tickets were bought because each wager appears in the blockchain.  I can then know that the winning tickets was chosen fairly because I can replicate the algorithm myself.  And I can know that the payment to the winner was made as that will appear in the blockchain as well.<p>Because nearly all the expenses of running a lottery are absorbed by the bitcoin network, these lotteries can be run profitably even when paying out 99% of the amounts wagered.<p>In other words, Bitcoin is versatile.  When anonymity is desired it can be attained.  When a fully auditable transaction register is needed, there are methods to allow that as well.<p>If instead you want an example of a payment network where your wallet is ""open to everyone"" see WingCash: <a href=""http://forum.bitcoin.org/?topic=4232.0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.bitcoin.org/?topic=4232.0</a>",1307037092

Now a key difference is that TV usually pays for the original content, but from the consumer's point of view it's the same: find OC, slap your station logo in the corner, and surround it with advertising. All those clip shows like 'craziest police chases' and 'worst TV moments' rely on this model. Hell, there's whole channels that rely on it...I saw one recently called True TV or similar that seemed to consist of nothing but recycled news footage (mostly crime/emergency drama', library sound effects, and some 're-actors' - industry-linked professionals who sit there making pithy or occasionally witty comments in hopes of leaving whatever line of work they are in and becoming z-list celebrities instead.<p>This seems to be endemic in American screen culture, slightly less so in the print world. In contrast, European copyright has a side feature called 'moral rights' 'droite d'auteur' - even if you sell the copyright, the original author <i>always</i> retains the right to be identified as the author. There's no financial obligation associated with this for the copyright owner, but it ensures the creator remains associated with the work. My <i>limited</i> recall is that in commercial copyright infringement disputes, courts take a strict approach to evaluating lost profits, but in cases where someone has stripped out the identity of the creator there are often additional sanctions, since it's considered an attack upon the creator's ability to earn a living in the future by being identifiable from their existing work.

Think of holders of vast wealth, who in an inflationary system, are forced to invest their money and earn a significant return in order simply  to maintain the value of their wealth. In a deflationary system, they are no longer at risk of losing wealth by letting their money sit in a bank, and so the least risky course of action for them is to simply hold on to their money. This means that the markets for things like angel investing and venture capital, among others, dry up as holders of significant wealth are no longer incentivized to invest their money.<p>An inflationary currency is what gives us our social mobility. Without it, holders of wealth don't make risky investments, meaning socially mobile entrepreneurs don't get funding to allow them to join higher social classes, wealthy investors no longer lose their shirts and move down the social ladder, and the society at large becomes entrenched in its current economic makeup.<p>I would not like to live in a society with deflationary monetary policy; money is meant to be spent and made to work for you, not hoarded.",1307036085

Unfortunately that means you need to have enough cash to bootstrap.<p>To defray the obvious argument, I will break down the chance as follows:<p>- If you are going into a startup, you are taking the chance that the startup will do sufficiently well that your equity actually has enough value to compensate for the lack of salary (and that's not necessarily within your control)<p>- If you are going into a company, you are taking the chance that your lifestyle won't scale to meet your income.  If it does, you won't have as much flexibility when you do want to do a startup.<p>The salient point here is that, with a company, the result of the gamble is completely within your powers<p>3) <i>Relationships</i>: You build relationships with hundreds or thousands of coworkers, on top of the umpteen companies you interact with on a daily basis, who have other skills that may be of help later on.

2612844,comment,2612416,2612416,7,0,geebee,,,"I agree, though you do need to make sure you choose a good startup.  There are still startups out there that view developers as interchangeable cogs, where you can end up with the worst of all worlds (no stable paycheck, no real autonomy, uninteresting work).<p>One thing I did notice - it can be a little risky to spend a long time at a single startup that fails.  I worked for a startup that did fail (and was a little crappy) for two years, and some people had been there for 8 or more years.  When it tanked, the people who had spent their entire career since college at the startup didn't have extensive networks to tap into for the next gig.<p>The ideal resume probably includes a stint at a large but respected company (such as google amazon), as well as some innovative work at smaller companies and/or startups and maybe some consulting and open source work.<p>Of course, the ""resume"" is starting to get a little outdated, and a lot of people would say the best thing to do is just start your own company when you're young and can afford the risk, rather than wasting those consequence-free first 10 years on resume building.<p>Now that I'm the primary wage earner for a family with two kids, trust me, I know the restrictions.  Interestingly, startups aren't really off limits to people like me in places like the Bay Area, because they keep your skills sharp and there is just so much hiring going on (the ol ""career security"" vs ""job security"" thing).<p>But what is off limits (or at least very difficult) is the ramen-level poverty you can afford when you're in your 20s and have nobody depending on you.  For the first 5 years after college, my rent was $350/month near the beach in San Diego, and that was the only real expense.  If I'd needed to, I could have driven that even lower.  That's a serious opportunity that goes away later in life.",1307034539

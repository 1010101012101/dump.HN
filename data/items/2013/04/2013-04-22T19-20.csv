I find it hard to believe that someone like John McCain, who had no problem with dropping bombs from his plane onto Vietnamese civilians [1], is so terrified by three civilian deaths at the hands of low-tech [2], deluded criminals. The big question, of course - possibly bigger than the terrorist act itself - is who benefits from this absurd inflation of the threat's magnitude.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Rolling_Thunder#Conclusions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Rolling_Thunder#Concl...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile)#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile)#History</a>",1366660786

Believe it or not, I came to SF 6 years ago to become a writer. It took me less than a year to realize that most of the writers in SF live in denial and are delusional. They believe the writing community here is as great as LA and NY and the only reason they can't get published is because of the evil, corporate publishing companies. This type of attitude is typical for all walks of life in SF, too, which is one of the reasons it will never regain the artistic prominence it had in the 60's. SF has yet to move past its counter-culture roots, despite the fact the rest of the country already has. That makes everything holding on to the old message feel dated and stale. Dated and stale do not make for good art.<p>>This story isn't about The Grove, it is about the tragedy of gentrification.<p>Gentrification isn't the real tragedy, here. It's complacency.

5591399,comment,5591168,5591193,10,0,anigbrowl,,,"The law defining 'weapons of mass destruction' was written in 1994, but does in fact reference pretty much any 'destructive device.' That latter term was first defined in 1968, and includes things like hand grenades or things with as little as a quarter-ounce of explosive material.<p>The 'mass' part reflects the principle of damage radiating outward from the origin and affecting whoever/whatever happens to be in proximity, as opposed to the more targeted destruction caused by a bullet or handheld weapon. Of course you could kill multiple people with a handheld weapon or (rarely) hit several people with a single bullet, but in general such attacks involve one-on-one interactions even if there is a series of them in rapid order, as with automatic gunfire. hitting multiple individuals from a single shot or manual attack is considered a fluke.<p>See notes on <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2332a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2332a</a> and <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/921"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/921</a><p>Note that the law is not necessarily drafted to reflect the actual probability of injury, but to dissuade any use of the method; explosive, chemical, biological and radioactive attacks are by nature indiscriminate. That's considered much worse than an attack on a particular individual (you could launch an indiscriminate attack by, say, firing a gun into a crowd. But that lack of care about who you hit would itself attract a higher sentence). Furthermore, it radiates temporally; if you plant a device and then drop dead of a heart attack, the device remains dangerous even though you are no longer capable of forming criminal intent. It presents risk from when it's emplaced to when it has finished releasing, a period which could last years. In similar fashion, using a bomb or poison to kill someone automatically makes the offense into Murder in the First Degree, negating defenses like 'crime of passion' or 'heat of the moment'.",1366660175

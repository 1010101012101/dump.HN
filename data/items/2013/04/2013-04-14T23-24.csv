An argument goes that if a particular invention were so simple then why hasn't anyone done it already? Motivation, ability, recompense?<p>One response is the right-place, right-time, etc.. That's basically the answer that everything would be invented at some point.<p>However the patent system has an answer to that too - the disclosure of the invention is key to gaining the limited monopoly. Earlier disclosure, as the premise goes, is beneficial to the people of the state granting the monopoly. Thus even if the invention is simple - provided it's not ""obvious"" [in the domain specific meaning of the term] - then the reward is still being provided for a benefit.",1365983807
5548946,comment,5546679,5548061,8,0,jules,,,"I'm going to give a mini monad tutorial here. Hopefully that will also clear up at least some of the confusion in the other threads here.<p>A monad is a container type with at least these three operations:<p>1. unit(x): Create a container with a single element x inside.<p>2. map(f,c): Given a container c with elements, call the function f on each element, and create a new container out of the results.<p>3. flatten(c): Given a container of containers, we can flatten it down by putting all the elements in the nested containers in a single container.<p>For example, a List<T> is a monad:<p>1. unit(x) creates a list with a single element.<p>2. map(f,list) calls f on each element of the list, and creates a new list out of the results.<p>3. flatten(listoflists) flattens the nested lists down. Note that flatten only flattens away one level, so if you have a list of lists of lists, then flattening it will get you a list of lists.<p>These operations have to have some laws, like:<p>1. map(f, unit(x)) = unit (f x): if we map a function over a container with a single element, we just call the function on that single element and put it inside its own container.<p>2. flatten(unit(c)) = c: if we wrap a container c in its own single element container unit(c) then flattening it gives us back the original.<p>3. flatten(map(unit,c)) = c: if we take each element of a container and wrap each one in its own container, and then flatten the result, we get back the original.<p>Turns out that you can also define these operations for sets and multisets. The interesting thing is that there are more things that fit in the API above. Futures, parsers, probability distributions, I/O operations, mutable state, dynamic scoping, exceptions, optional values, logic programming, continuations, asynchronous programming, and more. Monads are what all those things have in common. I think the only way, ultimately, to learn how monads work is to study many examples. You may ask yourself, for example, what does it mean to flatten a parser? Turns out you can give a meaningful definition for flattening a parser. If you study many such examples, you start to get the pattern.<p>What makes monads so neat to use is that you can define special syntax for it. For example list comprehensions can be translated to the operations above, which means that list comprehensions also work on all the other things that are monads. So you get ""parser comprehensions"" and ""futures comprehensions"". Similarly, mutable state has special concise syntax in imperative languages, but with monads that syntax also works for lists, probability distributions, etc. That's what do-notation is in Haskell.<p>I hope this helps somebody get interested in what monads really are about.<p>That said, to use I/O in Haskell you do not need to understand any of this. If you can read this:<p><pre><code>    do print ""What's your name?""
       name <- readLn
       print (""Hello, "" ++ name)
</code></pre>
Then you're good to go. You do not need to know that there is a I/O monad underneath this, you can just do like you're coding in an imperative language. The only difference is that the syntax above is not restricted to I/O and mutable state like it is in most languages, but it can also be used for creating parsers, manipulating lists, etc.<p>For example, the assignment operator in the I/O monad means assignment, but in the list monad it means ""take each element of"":<p><pre><code>    do x <- [1,2,3]
       y <- [4,5,6]
       return (x*y)
</code></pre>
This creates the list<p><pre><code>    [1*4,1*5,1*6, 2*4,2*5,2*6, 3*4,3*5,3*6].</code></pre>",1365983786

If I just totally missed a joke - ok, my mistake. But if you really don't see why it matters that the statement is false, I recommend really thinking about it for a bit.<p>Now, on to the thing about Haskell that the endless proliferation of monad tutorials obscures.. You don't actually need to ""understand"" monads to use it. You can get by on type signatures and the most basic parts of do notation for a long time.<p>In fact, that's what I did. I spent months working on haskell code, understanding the transformations I was making, but not understanding the abstractions beneath them. The first time I really grasped the purpose of the monad interface was when I decided to learn how to use the parsec library. I was a bit unsure how to combine smaller parsers into more complex ones, but just sort of tried do notation - and it worked. It worked exactly how I expected it to. And that's when I realized you could see the monad interface as ""The thing you need to make do notation work like you'd expect."" Even if I was still fuzzy on the details.<p>But before that, I was making use of monad transformers. I did a poll in the #haskell IRC channel once. Almost everyone agreed monad transformers are easier to learn about than monads. There's just one simple type signature involved, and it's easy to just fit the pieces together, without a deep understanding of what they mean. They end up doing what you expect, anyway.<p>You really can use haskell productively without understanding the underlying abstractions, so long as you are good at following the types. They're there to help you - they do the job pretty well, if you take a bit of time to learn how to apply them.",1365982528

Perhaps it is best to say that config files offer flexibility in this dimension, whereas a link file is more rigid.<p>> It could even be delayed until there is another compatibility breaking change.<p>I believe that perhaps the discussion on the point of backwards incompatibility has been framed in a way that is nonproductive.  Of course, once one has decided on a course of action, it is proper to consider how to reduce the impact of that decision.  I agree with you that there are a wide variety of harm reduction strategies available here.<p>But these inquiries only become relevant once one has decided that the patch is in general an improvement in some dimensions.  As an outside observer, I do not see an improvement.<p>I can see the logic that <i>if</i> it is true that git-add-and-friends have omitted support for submodules <i>on the basis</i> that such support is difficult, this patch could solve that problem.  But I have not been convinced of the premise; there is no citation of the people who maintain the UI tools making claims of difficulty.  Furthermore, Junio seems to argue at least that add's behavior is <i>by design</i>, I do not know enough about it to know if that is a sensible design, but it does suggest to me that the problem with UI tooling is not a function of implementation difficulty, but there is perhaps some design or ideological reason for the behavior of these tools that explains the state of them today.<p>The other problem that I have is as follows: if I accept the premise that the trouble with git-add is a matter of implementation difficulty, it seems to me that the trouble can be resolved at some other tool layer rather than in the FS proper.  So <i>if</i> the hypothesis underlying the patch is correct, it seems to me that one should adopt the implementation that doesn't break compatibility over the implementation that does.<p>It is unfortunate that the matter of backwards compatibility was raised early and vociferously in the thread, because as you have pointed out there is a lot that can be done about backwards compatibility that doesn't address the real merits of whether the idea is good or bad.

Given the recent slew of fiscal crises and increasing concerns about online privacy, these are two strong points in bitcoins favoror whatever future crypto-currency arises.</i><p>This was the funniest thing to read for me. It flies in the face of two of the biggest complaints I see about Bitcoin (the third being the ""it has no inherent value, not even status as legal tender"").<p>You mention that Brett Gordon is disagreeing with many people when he claims that being deflationary is a benefit. Even in this same article you see the exact opposite being said:<p>> <i>Unfortunately, as those familiar with Paul Krugmans writings on liquidity traps know, Bitcoins known and finite supply dooms it as a workable replacement currency.</i><p>So there's two completely contradictory positions on that issue. But also on the anonymous transaction issue. Every bitcoin transaction is quite obviously public, so that right adjacent to this quote is Chris Robert's:<p>> <i>The bubble can just grow and grow, so long as... the fundamental lack of anonymity doesnt bother anyone.</i><p>So in the same article we have economists saying built-in deflation and anonymity are benefits of Bitcoins, while others say deflation will kill any chance of viability as a currency and that Bitcoin has no anonymity. What's a person to think, besides that many economists don't really understand Bitcoin and are probably just as speculative as the people buying Bitcoin at $250 several days ago.",1365982086

You are of course right that being a monad does not mean being an instance of the Haskell type class Monad. It means being a monoid in the category of endofunctors. It does not mean ""anything that satisfies ... associativity and left/right identity"". You have to specify what operation is associative, which in this case is composition of endofunctors. Associativity and identity on binary operations on sets, for example, gives you a monoid, but not a monad.<p>Monads are more specific, and it is in that specificity that you find the requirement for monads to be ""polymorphic"": monads are endofunctors, and the monad laws concern the composition of those endofunctors. An endofunctor is a mapping between a category and itself. When we apply this category theory to programming, we talk about a category of types. In Haskell this is the category Hask. This is where the polymorphism requirement comes into play. The monad maps from Hask to itself. That means that it must be able to map over all types, which means polymorphism.",1365980689

Just over the river you have the Esplanade, with regular concerts, movie nights, and festivals. And that's all within a mile or so.<p>What kind of recreation are you looking for?",1365980675

5548771,comment,5547404,5548626,1,0,philwelch,,,"> I think that fiat money which is just backed by the word of the government that it's solid somehow works. Why and how I cannot explain nor do I seek to.<p>Because of fiat, of course.<p>To be precise, US Dollars are valuable because the US Government only accepts tax in US Dollars. Since taxes are levied on a proportion of economic activity <i>by definition</i>, that percentage of economic activity is instantly converted into demand for US Dollars. Additionally, thanks to legal tender laws, it's obligatory in the United States to accept US Dollars as payment for a debt. Thus, there is a large quantity of legally generated demand for US Dollars--enough to keep the currency valuable enough for other economic activities.<p>It is also no mistake or coincidence, for instance, that wages and salaries are paid in US Dollars. When you combine laws saying both ""income taxes must be paid in US Dollars"" and ""income taxes must constitute a proportion of total earned income"", it saves a lot of effort for the earned income to be denominated and paid in US Dollars. If you got paid in bitcoins, someone would have to calculate the value of bitcoins in USD, sell some bitcoins for USD, and pay the taxes in USD. Actually, this is exactly what happens with stock grants (in a publicly traded company).<p>Unless you can somehow generate similar amounts of demand for bitcoin, and simultaneously tightly couple that demand with major streams of economic activity, you won't accomplish the same thing. As far as I can determine, only the government can unilaterally dictate the currency that large, double-digit percentages of the GDP need to be denominated in.",1365980593

5548764,comment,5547973,5547973,6,0,michaelochurch,,,"I've written a lot about this in my blog series on the Gervais Principle (21 posts, and 0.8 being worked on).<p>First, you have the MacLeod hierarchy:<p><pre><code>    ""Sociopaths"" (upper management): strategic + dedicated + NOT subordinate
    ""Clueless"" (middle management): dedicated + subordinate + NOT strategic
    ""Losers"" (workers): strategic + subordinate + NOT dedicated
</code></pre>
MacLeod Sociopaths aren't all bad people, and Losers are not losers in the sense of being undesirable or unpopular people (in fact, it's often the opposite) but because low-end employment is a losing deal.<p>Someone who has all 3 is a Protege, but that's rare and conditional. If you don't invest in someone's career, a strategic person will <i>never</i> be subordinate and dedicated both. He'll either optimize for comfort (Loser route) or personal yield/glory (Sociopath route).<p>Work cultures tend to be defined based on what they value most.<p><pre><code>    Subordinacy uber alles: Rank culture (typical corp. environment)
    Dedication uber alles: Tough culture (e.g. Enron, Microsoft's stack-ranking)
    Strategy uber alles: Self-executive culture (e.g. Valve)
    Balance of the 3: Guild culture (rare, not seen in startups)
</code></pre>
VC-funded startups tend to be all-Clueless. The Sociopaths are VCs and executive implants who aren't really part of the company. Startups can't stand to have Losers, since they tend to require explicit management and the rules are too ill-defined at that point. So they often end up with the tough culture, which is the opposite of how startups wish to market themselves.<p>In rank culture, all you need to do to remain employable is get along with your manager; but in tough culture, there's an unwritten rule that everyone must be 100% dedicated to work. Total submission of effort replaces subordination. It's not actually that way-- people aren't actually willing to work 80+ hours without personal benefit-- but people who flagrantly break the rules get shown out.",1365980431

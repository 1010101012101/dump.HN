The most likely ""story"" is that it started operating.<p>><i>The Jiuquan Atomic Energy Complex (Plant 404) is centered on a 400-500MW light water graphite reactor [LWGR] fueled with natural Uranium. The facility includes a pilot plutonium reprocessing plant and a arge-scale reprocessing plant with a capacity of 300-400kg Pu/yr (both use PUREX method). It also includes a Nuclear Fuel Processing Plant for refining plutonium into weapons-usable metals.</i><p><a href=""http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/china/jiuquan.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/china/jiuquan.htm</a><p>><i>The small reprocessing plant in Gansu was completed about six years ago, but Chinese oversight agencies have not yet permitted it to separate any plutonium—as of last month, just two fuel assemblies have been dissolved in the nitric acid tank at the plant.

This is the state media reference to ""60-fold increase in uranium usage"", ""3,000 year uranium supply"". Since a fast reactor can't burn through fuel entirely in one go (it will fall apart), one of the requirements of a closed fuel <i>cycle</i> is reprocessing: fuel has to be removed from a reactor and re-fabricated. Certain waste products need to be removed, and pure plutonium* isolated for new fuel (this is a chemical separation).<p>*(Not in every reprocessing method. COEX (mentioned in the Carnege Endowment article, where the French are trying to persuade China to adopt it) co-extracts plutonium with uranium. The pyroprocessing method developed at Argonne (US national lab) co-extracts plutonium with every trans-uranic, so that the resulting fuel is essentially unusable as weapons.

2064837,comment,2063083,2063405,0,0,apriori,,,"I think this is a fairly sound assessment of both the designer and engineer psychologies. In my experience, engineers frequently fail to understand that design is the fundamental relationship between the consumer and your product, and as such, should be considered of equal importance to the quality of the code. From the perspective of the layperson who actually has to USE the software, an ugly or clumsy design may as well be a critical coding bug. And therein lies the problem: some engineers are incapable (or unconcerned) with understanding the psychologies of other people despite the fact that they are developing products that will ostensibly be used by other people. Engineers would do well to learn that code is the language of computers, and aesthetics is the language of the user.<p>I think tech start-ups could benefit by taking cues from architecture, where the relationship between designers and engineers is reversed, design having priority over engineering. Serious architects can go so far as to believe that design has priority over even physics -- and sometimes with good reason. Many designs have been declared by engineers to be ""impossible"" only to be successfully built. Usually after the architect yells enough. Of course, despite being notoriously difficult, such architects are bound to have immense value for engineers with enough creativity to execute their ambitious plans. And I'm sure that the engineers love the challenge of working with them. At any rate, it would be interesting to see the results of talented coders being challenged by the best designers in this manner.",1294091604

I haven't been testing this side of things, but just because a CPU can do a 60 FPS GUI doesn't mean it should. Deferring it to the GPU would certainly reduce power consumption while navigating a UI.</i><p>Both Charles Ying of Satine and wzdd seem sympathetic to this notion that the gpu is a power saving device.  Surely it is when doing complex work.  On the other hand, most smartphone usage consists of relatively simple screens and basic if any transitions.  If it's only going to take 3ms of CPU work to run a 150ms animation, by all means, figure out how to keep the OS from interrupting the high priority graphics task and make the CPU do it.  Particularly if the GPU would have to be on across the entire 150ms.  If not, what is the cost of copying the graphical content between the GPU and the CPU?  How much CPU does it take to initialize and set up the GPU for this extremely simple task you ask of it?  Is the CPU going to be able to sleep while the GPU is running the animation, and if not what kind of context switching and control costs are going to be imposed on the CPU to manage the graphics state?<p>We've barely begun to see multi-core cell phone GPU's, but the point of the GPU is basically to run lots of work at a nice low clock rate where voltages can be dropped.  If you dont have a lot of work to do, there's really no sense waking up the GPU and having it's extremely dumb poorly-branching cores chug away at figuring out, say, the SVG animations that a semi-competent ARM core could knock off right quick.  You're just wasting power turning on the GPU.<p>Smoothness and polish, I suspect, are much more a questions of resource allocation than CPU capability, particularly when you've got a sub 640x480 surface and a 1GHz core.",1294091131

It expounds on the technology's implications, supporting Maroon's assertion that even a small slice of the market will easily eclipse Google's stake in search. Of particular interest:<p>* Transportation is more dangerous than we think, and this is largely due to human factors. (Driver inattention is a factor in 80% of crashes; alcohol in 40%.)<p>* The purchase of private vehicles forces us into a ""one size fits all"" model. If someone goes skiing only once a year, he will purchase an SUV; if someone spends 90% of his mileage traveling alone to work, he'll still purchase a five-person sedan so he can haul around friends occasionally. By moving to a grid-like service that provides cars to us on demand, we will be able to choose the vehicle best suited to the type of trip we're making.<p>* Robotic cars could eliminate our dependence on foreign oil. Energy usage would be dramatically lower due to people using a vehicle only as large as they need for a given trip. Vehicles powered by alternative energy have a chicken-and-egg problem -- no one wants to build the infrastructure to deliver energy until people buy the vehicles, but no one wants to buy the vehicles until a ubiquitous energy infrastructure is in place. Robotic cars, however, would have no qualms with traveling halfway across a city to refuel, nor with waiting two hours in a lineup before refuelling.<p>* The transportation infrastructure will also become substantially more efficient, as cars will be able to travel much closer together without compromising safety. As a consequence, energy usage can be reduced another 30% by having cars draft one another.<p>* Before robotic cars would be accepted by the public, they'd have to meet much more stringent safety standards than we apply to human drivers. No one would accept a robotic car that killed a human, even if robotic cars on the whole were twice as safe as human drivers. Templeton figures we'll need cars on the order of 100 times safer than human drivers before they will be widely accepted. To convince people of the cars' safety, Templeton proposes the ""school of fish"" test -- imagine walking out onto a track swarming with cars travelling at 40 miles per hour, and having every car swerve around you no matter how hard you try to make them hit you.<p>* Robotic vehicles will record video everywhere they go, for this will prove invaluable in determining the cause of accidents. Any modifications to the driving software will then have the ability to be tested on the ""trillion mile road test"" -- they will have a corpus of testing data composed of the recorded footage of every trip ever made. New software will be tested against every vehicle accident that has ever occurred.<p>* The privacy implications of this universal recording are disconcerting. Templeton raises the spectre of a situation like that in Minority Report, where police can remotely override your control of a vehicle, locking you inside and transporting you to a destination of their choosing.",1294090607

With improved recovery systems there is more oil in each well, etc. With 17KM drills there is still more oil. At $140 per barrel there is more oil in Alberta than in Saudi Arabia. Oil reserves are proved out at a given price point. Exxon will not look for oil that can be extracted at $250 per barrel because that price point is not on the near term horizon. I personally doubt we'll ever hit an inflation adjusted $250 per barrel because of the substitutes available at that price point.",1294088741

Nvidia Optimus in notebooks (only) now apparently does very nice automatic seamless switching between CPU and dedicated GPU.  There are some good articles out there benchmarking the much improved battery life.  When the next round of SSD are released, one will be able to buy a pretty sweet laptop: powerful when you need it, but super efficient when you don't, and fast always.<p>I'm pretty certain I read (an article on anantech?) that graphics switching is explicitly not going to be supported on desktops until the next release of intel processors.<p>Here it is:<p><a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/4083/the-sandy-bridge-review-intel-core-i5-2600k-i5-2500k-and-core-i3-2100-tested"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/4083/the-sandy-bridge-review-i...</a><p>""Quick Sync with a Discrete GPU There’s just one hangup to all of this Quick Sync greatness: it only works if the processor’s GPU is enabled. In other words, on a desktop with a single monitor connected to a discrete GPU, you can’t use Quick Sync.<p>This isn’t a problem for mobile since Sandy Bridge notebooks should support switchable graphics, meaning you can use Quick Sync without waking up the discrete GPU. However there’s no standardized switchable graphics for desktops yet. Intel indicated that we may see some switchable solutions in the coming months on the desktop, but until then you either have to use the integrated GPU alone or run a multimonitor setup with one monitor connected to Intel’s GPU in order to use Quick Sync.""",1294088628

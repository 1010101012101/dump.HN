If you color your logo/colorscheme the same as them, you are just confirming visually that your brand is a copy of them, and not positioning yourself as different, which will make it harder to compete (gain mindshare as the marketers say).",1254660926

By decree of the Texas state constitution, the budget <i>must</i> be balanced each and every year. That's something that article misses out on.<p>Of course, there are some really stupid things that Texas does in relation to its spending. Namely, budgets are set two years in advance.

859978,comment,859859,859859,0,0,cduan,,,"Here is a little copyright intro for you. This is not legal advice; if you are in need of particular answers for your situation, please consult an attorney directly, as other commenters have indicated.<p>Copyright protects original creative expression. This is in contrast to general ideas, which cannot be protected by copyright. The difference between ideas and expression is hard to define, but a common example is that the concept of a story about two lovers torn by warring families is an idea (and thus unprotectable), whereas the particular story ""Romeo and Juliet"" is an expression of that idea (and thus protectable).<p>I think that most people would agree that the words of a movie are creative expression, and not general ideas.<p>What does someone else's copyright prevent you from doing? Copyright gives the author of a work four main exclusive rights: the right to make copies, to make derivative works, to distribute copies, and to publicly perform the work. If you perform an act that is within the author's exclusive rights during the term of a valid copyright, then you may infringe the copyright.<p>Subtitles and translations of subtitles would probably be considered derivative works, since they are derived from the original work, namely the movie.<p>There are also defenses to copyright infringement. Two come to my mind: fair use and the DMCA.<p>Fair use permits you to perform acts that would otherwise be infringements, because of certain public policy interests. It is extremely difficult to determine what constitutes fair use. Two considerations that are important factors are whether your use of the copyrighted work contributes something new to society and whether your use is taking away from a traditional revenue source of the author.<p>The DMCA provides a shield for website operators who accept user-provided content. If the website operator complies with certain requirements regarding taking down infringing content promptly, then the operator will be protected from many claims of copyright infringement.<p>Keep in mind that this is purely based on US copyright law, so things may be different if you are elsewhere in the world. Plus I am not considering the business side of things.",1254658452

A close friend killed herself 15 years ago, and I still think of her, probably at least once a month, and mourn her, and wonder what her life would be like if she were still alive.

859973,comment,859954,859954,0,0,chipsy,,,"No, because these things are not ""solutions."" They are technologies. You apply the right technology to the right situation. It is true that there are technology fads, but the fad technologies are often linked to growing awareness within the industry about the concepts they employ.<p>For example:<p>C++ -> Class-based object orientation<p>Java -> Virtual machines<p>Rails -> Web frameworks<p>NoSQL -> Scalability strategies<p>Erlang, Haskell -> Concurrency strategies<p>So really, the appropriate way to ask this question is, ""are these concepts enough to solve 80% of IT problems?"" Once the concepts are available to the mainstream, switching the specific technology is not a huge problem.<p>It's true that in the process of taking on fads, people tend to lose their way and become zealots, getting stuck on one concept as the end-all be-all, but that's true of most human topics.<p>I would venture to guess that at this point in time we're actually seeing a whole explosion of concepts thrust into the mainstream from many directions - some aged and well-known to academia, and others the result of front-line efforts.",1254658261

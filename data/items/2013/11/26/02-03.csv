6798794,comment,6798602,6798633,41,0,patio11,,,"That&#x27;s the sunk cost fallacy talking.  If you spend $10 on a domain name, you have $10 less with which to buy exposure to Google shares, bitcoins, yen, tulip bulbs, or Magic the Gathering cards.  This is true regardless of how you decide to settle the transaction.<p>There are variants of your complaint which are much more dangerous to bitcoin.  For example, suppose I hold no bitcoins and wish to either purchase or sell a domain name.  Should I effect the transaction in dollars, or should I use something a little less boring, like Google shares, tulip bulbs, Magic the Gathering cards, or bitcoin?  Well, most people wishing to buy domain names or sell domain names have access to dollars very quickly, but getting into or out of fractional alpha Black Lotuses depository certificates (FABLDC) takes a roundtrip of a few days and requires you to go either long or short FABLDC depending on whether you&#x27;re buying or selling the domain name.  You might, sensibly, not want to be either long or short FABLDC just to sell domain names, because a) price volatility, b) transaction costs (not just the vig you&#x27;re charged when going to/from FABLDC by the various FABLDC exchanges but also the overhead of installing FABLDC payment code, explain FABLDC to your accountant, and self-insure for the risk that your FABLDC are stolen from the technology company you trust to manage them for you), and c) why worry about FABLDC in a world where money exists.  (In a world where money didn&#x27;t exist, FABLDC would be, quite literally, one of the most impressive achievements ever.)<p>n.b. I apologize to techies of my acquaintance who might assume, by construction, that I am comparing bitcoin to fractional Black Lotus depository certificates.  Sorry for the implication -- it&#x27;s mostly an extended rhetorical device.  Like you, I also believe that alpha Black Lotuses are worth more than nothing.<p>[edit: Ah fudge, someone beat me to this metaphor on HN: <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5487050\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5487050</a> ]",1385434267

I don&#x27;t think most people at the time even realized just the lengths they went to.<p>E.g. consider cut and paste.<p>Easy? Right? You just have an app hand you a representation of the data to cut, and store it until someone chooses paste.<p>Except you&#x27;re on a machine with 512KB RAM, where T: (&quot;/tmp&quot;) might be on a floppy to save RAM.<p>The consequence is that &quot;everything&quot; in AmigaOS runs in its own &quot;task&quot; (process/thread - the distinction doesn&#x27;t mean much since there&#x27;s no memory protection). In a typical shell, when you do cut and paste, at least the following are involved:<p>- input.device (mouse handling)<p>- console.device (&quot;low level&quot; console window processing. This one doesn&#x27;t &quot;own&quot; a window but can render to any window, and handles things like escape codes)<p>- console-handler (&quot;high level&quot; console window processing; this one opens/owns the window, and can handle things like line editing)<p>- ConClip (this one registers handlers to handle cut and paste, and mediates the process)<p>- clipboard.device (mediates read/writes to clipboard &quot;units&quot;, so you can have multiple clipboards; knows where to write the clips)<p>- (possibly, depending on where T: is mounted: trackdisk.device, handling low level writes to floppy, or one of the ram disk devices)<p>- The shell process itself.<p>If you do a &quot;copy&quot;, the input device sends the raw mouse events to the console.device, which &quot;cooks them&quot; into higher level events it sends to the console-handler, which then calls a library function in the clipboard device which will start a background write of data to the appropriate storage device. Each of those exchanges apart from calling into clipboard device (which is a bit of a hack, to be honest, but ultimately leads to another async message AFAIK) is an entirely async message exhange.<p>If the clipboard was on a slow device, who cares? It&#x27;d get written in the background, and the source task would be informed when it was safe to change the contents of the buffer (cut and paste in general was accomplished by pointer passing, and it was up to the source application whether it wanted to make a copy, or avoid modifying the source buffer until it was safe).<p>The path back, to, where console-handler might send codes to trigger highlighting the text to the console.device, which renders to screen (and the window handling is mediated by yet another task, handling Intuition, the GUI).<p>All in all, it&#x27;s not unusual for a keypress to be processed by half a dozen tasks, and the resulting action to work it&#x27;s way back through another half a dozen tasks before you see the result on screen.<p>All of this has lots of overhead, of course, even on a non-MMU single address space OS - there&#x27;s lots of context switches, and lots of memory allocation for messages etc., all of which was anathema to most people writing OS&#x27;s for home computers at the time.<p>But it is exactly this that made the OS so responsive: You sacrifice absolute throughput for a system that took great care to do &quot;everything&quot; async, so the system was nearly always responsive.<p>(you see the same in Amiga hardware, which ironically lost out to the brute force approach of the eras PCs, only for us today to make it back to the &quot;co-processor&quot; model: My servers at work has an ARM core in every harddisk, and a PPC or ARM core on the RAID controllers, and many modern ethernet cards has SOCs with ARM cores too; much like my Amiga 2000 back in the day had a 6502 compatible on the keyboard, a Z80 on my SCSI controller, a 68020 accelerator for the main CPU and a 286 accelerator on a bridge board....)<p>Having worked on AROS (an AmigaOS compatible OS) console support, I can say that sometimes that division is really annoying - having to think long and hard about which task something belongs in. But it leads to a system that is still usable on a 7.16MHz 68000 CPU... On a modern machine (AROS runs on any modern x86 hosted under Linux, and &quot;native&quot; on some x86, ARM, PPC and m68k hardware; albeit still only single core) it <i>flies</i>.<p>In fact, you truly appreciate how light these OS&#x27;s were if you try them on modern hardware: I have an AROS setup that &quot;boots&quot; the Linux hosted version straight into FrexxEd (a great editor; one of the original authors is the guy behind CURL). On my laptop, it boots AROS and starts FrexxEd in less time than it takes a console-only build of Emacs to start....",1385433947

6798760,comment,6796219,6798610,2,0,tokenizer,,,"How are things improving? I&#x27;m guessing you live in some bubble land where everyone has a great life. San Francisco?<p>War, Poverty, Oppression, and Moral Decay are more of a problem than ever. Don&#x27;t mix up my points with social progress, which is an awesome achievement of our society. My moral decay lies more in trust in general and in the institutions we have to trust to function effectively.<p>War is continuous, with constant tension to this day. Iran and US peace deal for 6 months? Well, looks like Saudia Arabia and Isreal have teamed up to change that? Eastern European Rocket Grid for Rogue States in the area, justification Iran not needed says &quot;Putin&quot;? Fuck you says US/American Narrative of not liking Russians. Chinese and Japanese conflict over islands? Better not attack Japan China, The US has a defensive treaty with them. That would not be a good thing for anyone.<p>Poverty is continuous. Personally, I find it despicable that some people can live as billionaires with some thousands of children dying needlessly from diarrhea and malnutrition. Sure donating helps, but surely a system that allows such disparity surely something like this isn&#x27;t shocking... Not to mention the increasing amount of individuals in the US who rely on food assistance (which may be cut by this <i>improving</i> system)...<p>Oppression need not even be mentioned. Surveillance, Propaganda, the Prison Industrial Complex... You may have heard about the innocent man being forcefully given cavity searches / colonoscopy surgery / etc without probably cause in the US this past month? If not, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWg_JyJJqaU\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWg_JyJJqaU</a>. System is definitely improving. Who needs the 4th amendment...<p>And lastly, again, moral decay. I&#x27;ll modify my point to be less nonsensical for you. The fact that this all happens, and people like you say things are improving, given what we see as innovation everyday? That sounds like a decent amount of cognitive dissonance to me! The first step to a non philosophical based moral ground, that can justify/defend a horrifically immoral system, because fuck everyone else, it&#x27;s comfortable here where I live.

But imagine getting rid of the transaction log entirely--the entire code path. That will be faster even than a transaction log write to memory-backed filesystem.<p>But I agree that other write (and read) activity going on in the background and foreground, also limits performance--and in fact, I&#x27;ve seen the index write bottleneck that you describe in real life, more-so than simple transaction log writes.

899273,comment,898646,898646,0,0,trebor,,,"I hate cellphones, but I'm not a senior citizen, and am not any less educated than the ""adopters"".<p>I despise cellphones because I grew up with a father that had one. I was fortunate enough that, at that time, Dad could come home for lunch ... but it was inevitable that he would get interrupted. Later, when his office was at home (and he still had a cell phone) his boss would call and interrupt when Dad manage to find a lull to visit with the family.<p>Currently, my father works in the cellphone industry, and has some eight or more models down in his office. It's all we can do to get him away from them, and even then he'll have one or two phones with him. And it's still inevitable that he'll get interrupted by it! Only now, it could be a call, an e-mail, or an instant message.<p>The only time I have been thankful to have a cellphone with me was when I borrowed one, and was t-boned at an intersection.<p>Do I have friends? Sure! I chat with them every few days, email a little less frequently, and manage to talk on the phone with them once a month or less (we do meet frequently).<p>If I bought a cellphone it would be prepaid, <i>for business use only.</i> But then again, just like getting a driver's license ... there's a cultural sense of obligation that comes with the phone. If I get one, my friends will expect, and pressure, me to use it--just like they expect me to use my driver's license, even when I don't <i>want</i> to go out.<p>So, I keep adequate change to afford pay-phones (remember, when the power goes out you cannot get a signal on the cellphone as long as you can the pay-phones) just in case I have to make an emergency call.<p>Why <i>should</i> I care about cellphones? I'm ""connected"" enough as it is!",1256320764

899218,comment,898253,898889,0,0,dbshapco,,,"In this specific case, the dashboard-page function is actually sequencing operations, not performing them (except for 5, and I'd wonder why that couldn't be moved to a separate function), and can be described as such:<p><pre><code>  // - control the login sequence
  function login_sequence() {
    var user  = verify_login
    if (!user) {
       user = login();
    }
    var providers = collect_providers(user);
    var profiles = collect_profiles(user);
    var account_info = collect_account_info(user);
    load_templates(user);
    display_templates(providers, profiles, account_info);
  }
</code></pre>
(Forgive the guess at what your code might look like.)<p>State may be passed between called functions, and used in control decisions, but state should not be grossly manipulated in sequencing functions (I do find with this style of programming that at high levels the state passed around tends to be large 'context' objects, rather than granular arguments encountered at lower levels).  What I would NOT want to see in such a hypothetical login function is ALL the actual lower level code to do the login, collect the data, etc., so that essential higher order detail is obscured by the lower level operations.<p>A function's API comments do not need to repeat the purpose of called functions.<p>As I come up with API comments last, I usually think about them in reverse -- it's not 'I need to think of the single purpose of this function before writing it', but 'what single purpose did this function end up serving?'.  Not being able to think of a decent answer for the latter is a possible symptom of sub-optimal decomposition.  Then again, cutting blocks of code and pasting them into their own functions has become an instinct rather than conscious decision for me, so I'm effectively anticipating writing the 'single purpose' API comments.<p>At a certain level of detail I don't need to know the minutae of login, just that there is some black box function that controls the lower level details.  And if I need to know the details, I break open the function and follow its call flow (or look at the autogenerated call graph in the doxygen docs or similar).<p>Having read a lot of feral code, I find the major indicator of quality is the static navigability of the code base (i.e. can I find my way around just by reading the code in an editor, without resorting to debuggers or autogenerated documentation), and having a level of detail structure, akin to the zoom feature on Google maps, is one method of achieving navigability (and partially the value of OO techniques).  So it's okay to have functions/methods that simply sequence or aggregate calls to lower levels, and to describe them as such.<p>It was mentioned elsewhere on the thread that debuggers are useful tools in understanding a code base -- and I do often find myself setting breakpoints on code because it's near impossible to understand how particular functions get invoked by just reading the code.  Then examining the call stack at the breakpoint I see that event loop called the network code invoked some code to read a database, which called into some code to instantiate widgets, which called back into the database code, which called the code that calculates order totals and tax, which called the widget code again to update those fields, all of which goes 30+ levels deep.",1256319388

But what he really did was change a lot around how players are evaluated.  Taking these methods of rating players and adding them to a decent payroll and you're going to see increased success.<p>Also I personally think that Billy Beane's main focus wasn't really post-season success. It's putting a competitive team on the field - and puts butts in the seats for as long as they can in the regular season.<p>I know the A's are a bit battered right now but its hard to argue with the success they had for a long period in the late 90s' to early 00's with a really minimal payroll.",1256318986

Time and time again, tailored UI's are preferred. It is the reason for Apple's return to stardom as well as the rise of web 2.0.<p>Developers try to fight this mentality to work in their boxed solution and I understand it, but you have to clearly refute evidence to the contrary to believe that the user prefers application developed in this manner.<p>So If that is the case why not design an architecture that accounts for this reality and makes peoples jobs whose responsibility it is to assist the user instead of enforcing a developers domain on them.<p>As well, I do not agree that different UI's require different back end logic they require different work-flow logic and work-flow is not reusable. If they require different back end logic for say getCustomer, addCustomer, validateAddress then there is  core architectural flaw in the solution. How a customer is then displayed is a problem for the UI e.g. Do I show all info in one screen do I show pivots to make room for more screen real-state.<p>It is not Apples fault, that is faulty logic, Apple is giving their users what they want and their last quarter clearly reflects that.<p>Web sites that rely on web services are not tricky to scale look at my document on amazon I referenced. It is essential to scaling. Google, Amazon et. al. are doing this precisely for that reason scalability and to not be locked into back-end or front end technologies. Not to mention you are distributing all work-flow and dynamic templating to the clients, which in practice has a large impact on resource utilization.",1256318896

2. Login to HN
3. Download your list of saved links
4. Use that list to generate a sorted list of your favorite submitters
5. Output that list as a simple HTML file with appropriate links. You can now easily browse the saved links of each of your favorite submitters.<p>Please use this responsibly! The idea is not to bring down the HN server with a flood of automated traffic. You'll notice that there is a delay built into the script that slows down the HTTP requests. Don't comment that out! :-)<p>While writing this script, I noticed a few interesting things:<p>The first is that HN doesn't keep a permanent record of your saved links. After 210, it starts discarding the oldest ones. Perhaps this could be changed?<p>The second is that the top-ranked submitters tend to be people who submit more links. Makes sense. One way to improve this script would be to design a formula for submitter quality. For example, take the number of submissions that you voted up and divide it by the user's total number of submissions in that period of time. This involves even more scraping of the site, though, which I'm hesitant to do before pg gives this a thumbs up or thumbs down.<p>The third thing is the extent to which the ""new"" page can be a no man's land where good links go to die. Many of my favorite submitters have excellent submissions with only one karma point, which is a result of the ""now or never"" voting phenomenon. If a new link isn't given one or two upvotes within a few minutes of being submitted (so that it appears on the front page), it has forever lost any hope of getting the votes it deserves. Perhaps this could be fixed? One idea might be to give links a ""second chance"" at the new page if they receive an upvote after being completely dormant for more than a week.<p>I hope you enjoy the script! I've been teaching myself programming over the past year (mostly by reading SICP and Hacker News), and I would love to receive feedback. Is there anything I could have done better? Could I have written something in a more elegant way? Is there something I did really well?<p>Thank you to everyone for making this site so amazing.

When I'm sketching out functions, I typically outline what should be done with within the context of the function, then fill in the implementation details later.

  AddStartupShortcut(""Shell.lnk"", Path.Combine(INSTALL_PATH, ""foo.exe""));

  // Update device time:

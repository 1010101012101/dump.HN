568355,comment,568158,568292,0,0,apsec112,,,"Here's how the system works for US Federal income tax:<p>The tax structure is divided into brackets. As of now (2009), the brackets are 10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, and 35%. Each bracket has a cap, except for the top one; the caps range from $8,000 for the 10% bracket up to $358,000 for the 33% bracket (for single taxpayers, married taxpayers have different caps). Any income you earn under the cap is taxed at that rate. Any income you earn over the cap spills over into the next bracket, and is taxed at the next rate.<p>As an example, suppose that last year, you made $100,000, you're single, and you take the standard deduction. The current standard deduction is $5,000, so that reduces your taxable income to $95,000. The first $8,000 dollars that you earn is under the 10% cap, and so it's taxed at a rate of 10%. Since you earned more than that, you spill over into the other brackets; the next $24,000 you earn is taxed at 15%, the next $46,000 after that spills over into the third bracket and is taxed at 25%, and the final $16,000 is taxed at 28%. All together, your taxes are:<p>$8,000 * 0.10 + $24,000 * 0.15 + $46,000 * 0.25 + $16,000 * 0.28 = $20,380<p>(The actual figure is $20,578, but I rounded.) Hence, even though the tax rate on the last dollar you earn is 28%, you only pay 20.4% of your total income in taxes.<p>What Obama wants to do is rearrange the brackets so that, if you earn any income above $250,000, the income that spills over into the top brackets will be taxed at a 3% higher rate. Suppose you made $300,000 last year. $50,000 spills over into the $250,000 bracket, and so you pay 3% of extra tax on $50,000, or $1,500. Which, if you make $300,000 a year, is roughly a day's pay.",1240066736
568354,comment,567807,568105,0,0,banned_man,,,"There's a difference between being physically strong, having a backbone as you put it, and being a badboy. There are extremely muscular men who are very nice people, and there's also a huge middle ground (into which most men fall) between being a boorish badboy and a spineless pansy.<p>If a woman has a preference for muscular men, or skinny hipsters, or even fat men, that's fine. We all have our physical preferences. And the fact that women want to date men with enough spine to have meaningful character is a good thing. However, women who are attracted to loud, boorish, and stupid badboys are utter garbage.<p>The attraction to badboys is not aesthetic; many badboys are out of shape and ugly. I think the appeal of the badboy is that it provides release from the pressure that is put on women to ""marry up"". It's not looked down upon for a man to marry a woman less ambitious and intelligent than he is, as long as she's good on her own merits (e.g. if he's a Wall Street quant with a 155 IQ, and she's in a lifestyle career and has a 130 IQ, that's fine, because she's still a smart woman who can hold her own in intelligent conversation). Women, however, are expected to marry men with at least the same level of earning potential and intelligence, because of a lingering concern with gender roles and the expectation that the man will be equal or dominant. This obviously places a lot of pressure on high-power women. The appeal of the badboy is that, although he's virtually never intelligent or ambitious, he's dominant on account of his sheer arrogance and narcissism, but at the same time worthless enough that he can be flippantly discarded. This enables the woman to enter a relationship where she takes a submissive role, but one that has an ""off switch""; she can leave without pain, since it's unlikely that she'll form an emotional attachment to such a useless and defective man.<p>[*Edited for clarity @ 12:26]",1240066672

He's liable for quarterly ""estimated tax payments"", which should be 1/4 of the expected amount you owe to the government for the year.  But it's best to pay the minimum required by law, and bank the interest on the rest.<p>Also, he's wrong saying that the tax rate applies to the whole income.  This isn't that hard people.<p>EVERYBODY pays the same tax rate on the first chunk of money.  Then, a higher tax rate on the second chunk. Then a higher rate on the third chunk, and so on.  The last chunk-cutoff is at $250k.  So you only pay the higher taxes on anything OVER that amount.  So you make $255k per year, you're only getting a tax hike on the last $5k, and a tax cut on the rest (Assuming all of Obama's tax rhetoric on lowering taxes for everybody else is true, haven't looked close personally).<p>That's not to say that that self employed people (running a business w/ employees, or just a contractor) don't get screwed.  There is another tax to cover social security.  If you work for an employer, it's split half and half between the employee and the employer.  But, since you are your own employer in the case of contracting work, you owe both halves.  This is what's called the ""Self Employment Tax"".  Although remember that economics says that the business will just respond to this tax by lowering your salary the same amount, making you pay the whole tax anyway....<p>Anyway, the tax system really isn't that complicated.  There are lots of little details, but the basics of it are fairly well thought through, and are reasonably fair.",1240065866

Car companies may be losing money by the billions, but it sure would be nice if they made a profit, so let's wish a few more billion at them to lose, rather than making the hard decisions. It sure would be nice if the postal system could make money without making the hard decisions, so let's wish a few more billion at them.<p>At some point, you <i>have</i> to make the hard decisions. People spit at the word ""profit"" because of the various (mostly stupid) negative connotations given to it, but remember that no matter how socialist or even communist you may be, <i>SOMETHING</i> has to make a profit! Whether it's a profit in money or a profit in credits or a profit in sweet, sweet love, <i>something</i> has to generate more value than the effort you put into it, or you have no money or credits or love to subsidize your other desires with.<p>Now, if you make the right hard decisions, we can probably keep universal service. The article has several constructive suggestions. But some hard decisions will have to be made. (And for all the exciting rhetoric from the Obama administration about making hard decisions, I can't hardly name one actually hard decision he's made, rather than wishing more taxpayer money at things that make no money.) Individually, maybe we could afford a postal service that loses billions, but against an economy where everything is having trouble, we probably need to go to a model where the post office at least breaks even... and if that means losing something ""nice"", well, so be it.",1240065829

With withholding, people never see the money they're losing -- hard to miss what you've never had.<p>In general, though, increasing withholding is exactly what I do when I work as a contract employee. But I rarely do that any more.

So I end up making a lot one year, owing a bunch of taxes, and then when the bill comes I'm making zero. Then I have to choose between paying taxes and feeding the family. Or the flip-side, you borrow money when you're making zero and then you start up a high-rate job and have to spend the first few months paying back loans instead of getting caught up on back taxes.<p>But like I said, listening to others I'm sure there must be something wrong with me.

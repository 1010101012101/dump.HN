Furthermore, this performance has been consistent over decades.<p>Of course, this doesn&#x27;t mean that this performance will necessarily continue indefinitely; knowledge diffuses, and their strategies will eventually become public, turning from &quot;alpha&quot; into &quot;beta&quot; (like trend following has in the past). They need to keep innovating to continue beating the market.<p>Also, the biggest issue of strategies like this is that they are severely constrained - you just can&#x27;t put more than a certain amount of money into them.

I merely placed your theory and evidence within a historical and ongoing context of oppression (slavery and state sponsored oppression didn&#x27;t end 150 year ago).<p>Pretty sure that Jim Crow and Slavery aren&#x27;t speculation, but are common historical facts that don&#x27;t require citation, much like saying World War 2 or the Annexation of Crimea happened doesn&#x27;t require citation.<p>The point wasn&#x27;t that single parent households aren&#x27;t a cause of poverty (it certainly doesn&#x27;t help), but that it is far too simplistic, that it is probably more symptomatic than causal, and with a US political lens can be seen as a case of dog whistle politics (not accusing you personally of engaging in such politics, which I should have made more clear).",1454870936

Most people I know don&#x27;t care if it is Walmart, they just want to exchange currency for goods and services.<p>But like, most people in town just want to put food on the table and whatnot, and meat prices are, for example, about a buck higher per pound for beef (not that anyone in town can really afford beef at current pricing; all the stores around here have shrunk what beef occupies in the meat case due to that), they have a very poor selection of fruits and vegs, the bakery sells the absolute worst tasteless and sometimes stale products, and Walmart brand foods are absolutely disgusting sometimes and aren&#x27;t even cheaper than other store&#x27;s store brands.<p>Walmart just seems to do everything wrong.

I was floored when a colleague told me he saw Afterglow on the front page of HN this morning, I wasn’t even aware it had been submitted.\nYour ideas of crowd feedback input are interesting. If you can get those encoded as MIDI or OSC somehow they could feed right into cue variables and effect parameters. As for ambient noise, one of the next big areas I want to explore is audio input and FFTs so that effects can respond to energy at different parts of the audio spectrum, and let you build sound-driven light shows—like some multi-head fixtures can do already, but spread spatially over your entire lighting rig, regardless of who made which piece.<p>I hope you can explore building some of those ideas and let me know how they go. I’ve found the framework so far to be very productive for integrating with new concepts—I added control of laser shows via Pangolin Beyond over UDP in a weekend. The learning curve is steep (less so if you know Clojure) but I’m happy to help and answer questions, and that’s been improving the documentation too.<p>And thanks for your feedback about the README. I know it can use more work, it’s hard to explain something this sprawling, but I keep improving it. I also want to shoot some video of the rich grid controller interface on the Push and Launchpad, how they tie to the web UI and other MIDI controllers, and how effects can react to pad pressure.

I&#x27;m in Canada so examples we often cite are the Canadian Pension Plan (CPP), Ontario Teacher Pension Plan (OTPP) and the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS). All of these do a lot of private equity investing and OMERS in particular has invested in a number of Canadian tech companies and IPOs, incuding recently Shopify and Hootsuite. All of them have had quite impressive and consistent results as well.<p>The problem with using public index funds to mimic these managers asset allocations is the higher volatility of publicly traded assets. For example in 2008 widespread panic caused people to sell their mutual funds and flee to cash which widely hold a variety of assets, so all of them suffered. This included publicly traded Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). At one point they were selling for 80% of their on paper asset value, which was entirely irrational. Many money managers that typically invested privately in commercial real estate because of that volatility took that opportunity to buy public REITs at a discount.<p>That being said, you can definitely do a decent job of adding asset class diversification with modern ETFs (and the market for these keeps growing). There are now infrastructure ETFs, REITs (Vanguard&#x27;s REIT is really well priced), covered call ETFs, etc. Just don&#x27;t expect to get exactly the same results of these managers and expect to have to handle larger volatility.<p>That being said, if you can weather these market movements, and you are saving regularly, volatility can be a good thing, if you can take advantage of lower asset prices with ongoing contribution then that is great.",1454870129

Around early 2007, Bungie ( the game studio that made Halo ) released a bunch of devcasts in which a handful of the developers would all sit around, shoot the shit, and talk about building the game. I naturally thought it was awesome and looked for tutorials on Youtube. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t stick with it due to the steep learning curve and decided software development was too hard ( If only I had a mentor/teacher at the time ).<p>A few years later though my friend and I wanted to bot the game Runescape to make some money. The most ban-proof way at the time was to use this program called Simba and you wrote scripts with a pasacal-like language. Everything was based on the pixel color of something and most of the bots were simple procedural programs. Due to the simple nature of the scripts, you could easily write something without a ton of prerequisite knowledge and see if it worked or not. The biggest problem with this method was color and object detection, how do you know if what you&#x27;re clicking on is a tree or some grass? At the time, the hotshots in the community were mostly people enrolled in cs programs and building neat algorithms to detect stuff. The only way to compete with them was to learn the fundamentals of cs. so of course that&#x27;s exactly what I did!<p>Gaming provides a fantastic playground for learning because it&#x27;s fun and there are very clear rewards for learning more ( Learn matrix manipulation, get better object detection, make more gold ).

I believe it is impossible to make C++ memory safe without making it not C++ anymore.<p>Do you consider D to be a derivative of C++? I don&#x27;t. They have a near perfect C++ interface. D can even catch C++ exceptions. It&#x27;s pretty sweet. You can hear about the black magic Andrei used to get that to work here:<p><a href=""http://cppcast.com/2015/10/andrei-alexandrescu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cppcast.com/2015/10/andrei-alexandrescu/</a><p>Side note: I&#x27;m actually thinking the Rust and C++ comparison misses the mark. First of all, C++ cannot be obsoleted by rust, it&#x27;s economically impossible. Secondly, I don&#x27;t even think they compete in the same domain space. Rust is actually lower level than C++, in that it does lower level stuff in a more natural way. It&#x27;s C, that Rust makes obsolete; which is something C++ totally failed to do (because of it&#x27;s RTTI, exceptions, and other runtime features -- all things you and the rest of the Rust team intelligently scrapped). After trying embedded Rust, I&#x27;m completely done using C (and the C parts of C++).<p>IMO the advantages C++ still has over Rust are:<p>- libraries, libraries, libraries<p><pre><code>    - C++ has so many great libraries\n\n    - *writing* C++ libraries with SFINAE sugar is the bees knees.\n</code></pre>\n- much better support and tooling, but this is for sure a temporary advantage.<p>- template meta-programming feels like a different language, it&#x27;s dynamic, functional, and the difference is refreshing. I like the mental switch you have to do to go from writing a C++ template to writing a C++ model.<p>- as much as header files suck, they let you skim an API much more easily than Rust or Swift.<p>- performant, memory safe data structures:<p>For example, it&#x27;s trivial to write a low overhead pointer that can&#x27;t dangle, throws an exception on nullptr deference, and that safely points to an object it doesn&#x27;t own (even if that object is its owner). With this and a unique_ptr composed with similar safety mechanisms you now have the primitives needed to write any data structures or algorithm so that it is protected from undefined and unsafe behavior, yet remains performant. This solution has significantly less overhead than using reference counted pointers like shared_ptr derivatives or Rc. The performance tradeoff over using raw pointers is minuscule and totally dwarfed by the gain in safety guarantees. From what I&#x27;ve observed, you can&#x27;t do this in Rust, if you try to write a doubly linked list you either have to use C-pointers that can dangle inside unsafe blocks, or eat the Rc overhead.<p>EDIT: How could I forget to mention the glory that is constexpr?<p>Advantages of Rust over C++ (again, IMO):<p>- the correct defaults (aka opposite of C&#x27;s insanity)<p>- best C++11 features built in and defaulted (move semantics, unique_ptr is Box<T>, Rc is shared_ptr etc..)<p>- Bad ass embedded capabilities. You don&#x27;t nearly feel as crippled like you do in C++ without the STL.<p>- the safety guarantees are real, and they&#x27;re awesome<p>- move semantics into closures looks so goddamn elegant. I love it<p>- inline assembly doesn&#x27;t feel like a hack<p>- modules and cargo rock<p>- secretly and surprisingly similar to ruby in a lot of places :)<p>- it wants you to think functionally, and unlike Swift, it means it.

Instead, I think programming should first be presented as a tool - rather than a complicated science.<p>The comp-sci courses I had access to in high school / college were all depth-first, so the barrier of entry was overwhelming. The dense theory, to me, was so much less attractive than solving a problem with a BB plugin or broken Javascript in the real world. I believed I was going to be a script kiddy forever, because I enjoyed tinkering and tweaking more than traditional coursework.<p>It didn&#x27;t click for me that I could be a &quot;real&quot; programmer until after I dropped out of college (was studying Latin/Classics, no science or math background). I started building my own games and game-helper apps, in Python, while working an IT helpdesk. Observing people interact and engage with things I built gave me the confidence to pursue a career in web development, using MOOCs (MITx series was excellet) and project-based tutorials to self-educate. I stepped up to tackle more real-world problems outside the scope of my helpdesk position, mostly day-to-day scripting and org automation.<p>So, educational strategies like Human Resource Machine really tick the right boxes for me. If I had played that game years ago, I think I would&#x27;ve gravitated towards comp-sci much earlier. I needed a strong reward system (coworker&#x27;s gratitude) to propel me through advanced topics, and game-ification of edu is all about treadmilling through a reward track.<p>I hold the title of software engineer today, without ever having completed a formal comp-sci course outside of MOOCs. I don&#x27;t think this narrative is uncommon, especially among women or first-generation programmers. I clearly demonstrated the skills necessary to be a successful developer: linguistics and programming share many common themes. But I was funneled towards a silly Latin program, because I and my academic advisers thought my non-existent math/science background precluded me from computer science.<p>Progamming has seeped into the vernacular of day-to-day problem solving, and I think this is the angle that intro courses should seize.",1454869642

But I&#x27;m not sure that an intentional thought process should lead to different conclusions. It depends on what the goals of conservation are.<p>Humans have, by our presence, drastically altered a variety of ecosystems in ways that can&#x27;t be undone. In the case of the Condor parasites, it&#x27;s unclear, but it&#x27;s possible that if the mites and lice had been left alive that would have been the difference that drove the condors extinct. A non-intervention approach might have extincted all three species.<p>A more extreme example: in the Galapagos, human-introduced flies have been killing the finches that inspired Darwin. A non-intervention approach is arguably the most natural, but this would likely cause the finches to go extinct. Intervening to kill the flies might save the finches, but it also involves ecosystem changes to kill the flies and interaction with the finches that demonstrably has already modified their behaviors. Ultimately, returning the finches to their original state is not an option, so any course conservation takes will result in an ecosystem that differs from what Darwin observed.<p>Given we can&#x27;t undo the changes we&#x27;ve already made, it makes sense to make these kinds of choices based on human factors. It makes sense to choose majestic condors over lice and mites, historically valuable finches survival over their unmodified behavior, human health over guinea worms, and human health over malaria and the mosquito populations that carry it. Extinction of mosquitoes in particular has far-reaching ecological effects which we should strive to understand and mitigate, but I doubt that any of those effects will be more compelling to me than the suffering caused by malaria.<p>A pragmatic view of conservation realizes that change is inevitable, and the best we can do is push that change in positive directions, and further, that &quot;positive&quot; is subjective.",1454869129

The problem is that unlike modern sewer systems, London&#x27;s is used for both rainwater and household sewage. And the original system was designed to overflow into the Thames, on the assumption that would ~never happen. But population growth and lots more concreting means it now happens regularly. The Thames Tideway is a massive, very deep underground tunnel that roughly follows the path of the river.<p>2) The London Underground is the world&#x27;s oldest underground railway. It is upgraded continuously. The Crossrail upgrade is the largest construction project in Europe (technically Crossrail is not LU, but it&#x27;s all a part of an integrated somewhat underground network).<p>3) The UK road network costs less to maintain than is raised via fuel taxes. The roads are effectively a profit centre for the government, in a sense. They are maintained continuously.<p>4) The UK water pipe network has had leaks at an economically sustainable level for 15 years now (i.e. the cost to find and fix the remaining leaks is higher than the value of the water lost). It does not use lead piping:<p><a href=""http://dwi.defra.gov.uk/consumers/advice-leaflets/lead.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dwi.defra.gov.uk/consumers/advice-leaflets/lead.pdf</a><p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s actually any difference in infrastructure age between Europe and America.

The biggest impact of WW2 on the London Underground, for example, is that these days they have to do systematic searches for unexploded underground bombs before doing any work.",1454868719

Bringing forward claims of harassment in the tech world turns your life (and that of the accused, if their name is publicized) into a shitstorm; people don&#x27;t tend to do that without reason. But this is just a heuristic. It looks like Horvath&#x27;s claims of harassment might be unsubstantiated in this case.<p>It&#x27;s hard to tell, though, because most of the things she complains about (with the exception of the code-review stuff, which appears to be just false, which is worrying) is unverifiable outside of he-said/she-said. Note the noncommittal wording: &quot;The investigation found <i>no information to support</i> misconduct or opportunistic behavior by the engineer against Julie or any other female employees in the workplace.&quot; <i>No information to support</i> suggests &quot;neither evidence for or against&quot;.

3504126,comment,3502850,3503792,7,0,asd344335345,,,"""In a paper published in 2008 and focused on the then latest version (v5.1a) and its plausible deniability, a team of security researchers led by Bruce Schneier states that Windows Vista, Microsoft Word, Google Desktop, and others store information on unencrypted disks, which might compromise TrueCrypt's plausible deniability. The study suggested the addition of a hidden operating system functionality; this feature was added in TrueCrypt 6.0. When a hidden operating system is running, TrueCrypt also makes local unencrypted filesystems and non-hidden TrueCrypt volumes read-only to prevent data leaks. The security of TrueCrypt's implementation of this feature was not evaluated because the first version of TrueCrypt with this option had only recently been released.""",1327398969

Why?<p>> -  If field technical staff are engineers, then the associated revenue is presumably license fees and the cost is R&D.<p>> -  If field technical staff are consultants, then the associated revenue is services and the cost is COGS.<p>>Why does this matter?  Because most software company boards and investors see the world in a pretty black-and-white way:<p>> - License revenue is good.  Services revenue is bad.  (Largely because gross margins run 98% on the former and 20-30% on the latter).<p>> - R&D expense is investment and ergo good.  Cost of goods sold is bad.<p>>Almost all Silicon Valley boards will want an emerging enterprise software company to run with a consulting business thats no more than about 20% of total sales.  In practice this means a company can have at most about 1.5 consultants (pre- and post-sales) per salesperson.  Any work that cant be done either as R&D investment or by that small consulting team needs to get handed off to partners.<p>So, do you want high growth or do you want to help your clients?  The two do not always go together quite as well as you might have hoped.  To rephrase the point in Dan Shapiro's terms, many of the most worthwhile businesses out there have reasonable, not outrageous margins.",1327398093

Also, it really helps to somehow weasel/tap your way into the hiring side. ;) Even if it's just to see the submissions of applicants.<p>An important principle of negotiation is knowing their interests as well as you can. And presenting a representation of yourself which strongly satisfies those interests.<p>Basically, all the work is done before the negotiation; the point of negotiation is where it all comes together and you use all that pressure you've built up to (politely) bear.<p>If you have a take-home project, great, you can hit it out of the ballpark by adding all the professional polish that virtually no other applicant will do  have it build, solve corner cases, or casually note that it was tested on 3 platforms; whatever's vaguely appropriate. Virtually everyone else cuts some corner somewhere. Most will submit a minimal answer, to a question which resembles  but isn't  the take-home question.<p>To the company struggling to find a good coder, this makes you a drool-worthy thing to purchase, like the newest Mac.

For example, creating mock objects and ensuring they are reflective of what they are mocking is difficult. Imagine if you could take the built-in asserts and the unit-tests for a component and use them (or some tagged subset of them) as a spec. for automatically creating mocks. Imagine if determining unit-test coverage and which tests should be run based on code changes was automatic and trivial. Etc.<p>Certainly profiling can be performed on any binaries provided you have symbols for them, but is that really the best we can do? I have a hard time believing that adding support for instrumented binaries at the compiler level isn't a good idea.<p>What I mean by ""round-trip between code and parse trees"" is the ability to have easy access to parse tree structure either in code or to external tools. So that you can do things like easily build in refactoring support to IDEs, or to more intelligently merge code changes at a higher level than merely lines of text in a file.<p>Of course, none of these ideas are anywhere near fully baked, they would require research, experimentation, and a lot of hard work. But I'd rather see people pushing the boundaries of programming languages with novel research rather than just throwing yet another mashup of already existing features out into the wilds in hopes it'll survive.",1327397891

Do I have to drive to work? If my car breaks, could I buy/lease a late model new car (one that I expect will not have problems)?<p>* Do I live close to friends, so that I can see them as often as I desire, or is the distance an impeding factor?<p>* Can I walk to the supermarket, cafe or restaurant, or do I have to drive everywhere?<p>* How large is my home, in sq. ft? Do I have a yard?<p>* Can I vacation in a foreign country or expensive city? Will I have to couch surf or can I afford a hotel?<p>* Am I able to contribute to a retirement plan? Do I have money to invest with? Can I put aside enough money that I will be able to buy even a modest home in my neighborhood in a few years?<p>* Do I live in a city that has a vibrant cultural scene? Are there many good restaurants?<p>* If I lose my job, could my savings cover 12+ months of unemployment? (Or, could I leave my job and work on my own projects for 12 months?)<p>For me, comfort is being on the right side of all of the above questions, and it would be a stretch to do it on $100k in the SF Bay Area.

There are always cases where to facts don't clearly map to the rules as they are written down, or where the facts are unclear or open for interpretation. In those cases, even specialists can't say if something is 'illegal', for a broad definition of the word 'illegal'. Despite the huge amount of legislation and case law we have nowadays, still not everything is covered; in the past, there was much more uncertainty than there is today, because much less was codified.

Everybody who visited the Dropbox and Megaupload websites a few weeks ago could see so. Now the nerd reaction to the legal aspect is 'oh but there is no law that indicates the exact boundary between the two, so the Megaupload bust is illegal'. Back on planet reality however, softer interpretations of 'intent' and 'reasonable' etc. decide what crosses the line and what doesn't. Could Megaupload know in advance exactly how far they could go? No. Is that proof that our legal system doesn't work?

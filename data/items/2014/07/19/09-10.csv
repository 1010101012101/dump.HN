8057099,comment,8052589,8056276,1,0,personlurking,,,"Great (and true) points. I like to think of the process as one might think of exercising a part of the body, in that one shouldn&#x27;t let the muscles get used to just one method. When people ask me what&#x27;s the best method to learning a foreign language, I say &#x27;do them all&#x27;. I also advocate for the &#x27;translate word by word&#x27; technique and to realize what you can do alone (reading, writing, listening) should be better than what you can do with someone else present (speaking). In other words, work on what you can, when you can. Small steps, consistency and not giving up are also key factors.",1405763903

8057085,comment,8053134,8053134,3,0,doxydexydroxide,,,"1. What has your experience been?<p>Incredible! Extensively checked out all the major European Cities for 2 years before making the move. Government & Commercial Aerospace R&D funding fell off a cliff in 2003 and that triggered the move.<p>2. What is your particular career?<p>Safety critical Air & Space Flight Control Systems Design & Certification. Commercial, Military, Space.<p>3. What were your moving expenses?<p>$11,000 dollars in 2003<p>4. How much is your rent or did you buy?<p>1143 Euros per month or $1545.85<p>5. Where did you move to/from?<p>FROM:KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI\nTO:VIENNA, AUSTRIA.<p>6. How are the schools?<p>AMAZING! I had 3 young children (3,7,10) when we moved in 2003. The Vienna Bi-lingual Schooling project is a world famous education initiative. My 2 school age children had no difficulties. My 3 year old went into 2 years native German kindergarten.<p>After 4 years, both of my 2 older children moved to the German schooling. They have native Viennese accents, without any US detectable accent.<p>Education in Austria is intense, compared with the US. Up until the 9th year, kids go to school only 4 hours a day, and no homework!<p>The emphasis is entirely different. In the US, emphasis is on the 1st 4 years of gaining solid BASIC competency, at which point intensity goes to zero.<p>In Austria, the first 4 years are used to expose children to a large variety of subjects, and then the student decides where their interests are, and then attend the schools focused on that subject.<p>The 5th - 13th(HTL) years are intense. With the 9th year, students are taught the equivalent of college courses.<p>My oldest already knew what she wanted. BioEngineering! When we de-registered her at school, they gave us her education records, which contained testing results showing that she was 5 years ahead of her age in math and science!\nShe attended HTL Rosensteingasse. A world renowned school of chemistry. <a href=""http://hblva17.ac.at/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hblva17.ac.at/</a><p>My middle son is at HTL Spengergasse which focuses on computer programming. <a href=""http://www.spengergasse.at/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spengergasse.at/</a><p>My youngest also starts at Rosensteingasse in the fall.<p>Higher Education is 100% free! So anybody who can pass the Matura(a tough school leaving certificate test founded in 1851) is guaranteed by law a free higher education.<p>7. Have you become fluent in the native language and was the language barrier difficult to overcome?<p>Yes, our entire family is fluent. German is a challenge for native English speakers. As Austrians are proud of their english lanugage education in school. They want to impress you with it, and practice it, wherever you go. They immediately pick up on your being a native English speaker when you talk German. You have to be polite and insist on speaking German with them, if in anything other than a shopping experience.<p>8. How long have you lived in this country? Are you a permanent resident or do you plan on moving back to the US?<p>We have lived here for 11 years. We are all permanent residents. Vienna is home for all of us. We have fully integrated.<p>I love my country (USA) but hate my government (USA).<p>Every American deserves the quality of life that Austrians have, thanks to the structuring of the Austrian Constitution on the US Constitution after WWII, Austria is the country that the USA used to be when I was growing up. A government of virtue, and a nation of &quot;self interest rightly understood&quot;. A land of safety and security. A land of highly educated and intelligent people.<p>Now, its a nation given over to legalized (legal is what you can get away with (Bill Clinton)) piracy (take what you can, give nothing back(Captain Jack Sparrow)), kleptocracy and crony capitalism. Dog eat dog, everybody for themselves, and buyer beware. Injustice is everywhere you look. Crime is rampant. There is no &quot;America&quot; or &quot;Americans&quot; any longer. Just selfish spoiled brats who never grew up, and their victims. The rare exceptions can be found in the &quot;flyover states&quot; places like Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas, and Missouri where we lived before emigrating to Austria. However the disease has now infected these once sheltered areas, and taken hold in a majority of the population. There are a few isolated pockets such as Boulder Colorado, however the signs of infection are now visible here as well.<p>The USA is a majority population of Apostates (who have perverted the rule of law, the Constitution and Declaration of Independence. Urinating on wisdom of the founding fathers.<p>Most egregious examples:<p>1. The &quot;American Stazi&quot; (NSA,FBI,CIA).<p>2. The Toyota software/hardware defect coverup & conspiracy \n<a href=""http://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?section_id=36&doc_id=1321694"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?section_id=36&doc_id=13216...</a><p>3. The killing of Aaron Swartz.<p>I am proud to be an American. I am embarrassed and ashamed of my government, and the people who disgrace our proud heritage as cowards who tolerate the destruction of this once great and proud nation.<p>&quot;But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.&quot;<p>Where is the outrage. Where is the revolution?\nOnly a &quot;second republic&quot; of the United States of America will solve this problem.<p>I am a 3rd generation US citizen with all of my genetic heritage from Ireland.<p>I now live in a land with a terrible past (NAZI Genocide in WWII) which learned the tragic mistakes of the past and now respects life, and personal freedoms more than the victor of WWII and the worlds only superpower. I respect the Austrian Government far more than the government of the United States of America. This is a personal tragedy.<p>At this moment it is deeply painful even thinking about possibly giving up US citizenship (Hold out hope of revolutionary change). I regret that this however has become inevitable. The USA shall not recover its virtue in my, nor my children&#x27;s lifetime. The people have to be willing to fight for it! FREEDOM IS NOT FREE. Citizens must hold its government accountable to the rule of law. US citizens choose not to given the cost of personal sacrifice. A Napoleonic &quot;DIVIDE AND RULE&quot; has poisoned our people and our politics.<p>We should be Americans first, but sadly we are now Americans last.<p>9. What was the process like to become a permanent resident?<p><a href=""http://www.migration.gv.at/en/types-of-immigration/permanent-immigration-red-white-red-card.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.migration.gv.at/en/types-of-immigration/permanent...</a><p>I was classified as a &quot;Very Qualified Worker&quot; which substantially reduced the red tape.<p><a href=""http://www.migration.gv.at/en/types-of-immigration/permanent-immigration-red-white-red-card/very-highly-qualified-workers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.migration.gv.at/en/types-of-immigration/permanent...</a><p>Permanent residence in Austria also conveys permanent residence in the whole of the European Union.<p>Permanent residence requires B1 level German competency.<p>After 5 years of full time employment in Austria, exceeding a minimum income requirement, one can become a legal permanent resident of Austria and the EU.<p>10. Did you have to already have a job when you moved to that country?<p>Yes. In 2003 this was the case. However this is no longer the case with the Red-White-Red card (EU blue card)<p>11. What&#x27;s the cost of living compared to where you moved from? Has your quality of life improved or not? How and why?<p>The European Union spends far more money on Aerospace R&D than any other country in the world. Its why Airbus is the world leader in commercial aircraft, and Ariane is the number one satellite launcher. NASA is a hollow political bureaucracy compared to world leaders DLR & CNES.<p>Weather: mild winters and summers.<p>Skiing and climbing in the Alps.<p>Austria is a country which tries its very best to eliminate &quot;uncompensated externalities&quot;(subsidies and privatizing gain while publicizing losses are extremely rare, but do exist here but in lower proportion). Actual costs (healthcare, pollution etc.) are incorporated in product pricing. Most things, as a result, cost more than in the US.<p>Austria is a &quot;social&quot; country(not socialist/communist). Over 50k in income taxes are 50% or greater, and very few tax deductions are allowed.<p>My quality of life has skyrocketed in comparison. Vienna & Zurich Switzerland for the past 40 years have had the highest quality of life in the world. I gave up my McMansion in a gated community in the USA for paradise on earth. My children have the very same freedom I had as a child growing up in the early 70s. Children here as young as kindergarten travel unaccompanied on the public transportation system to school. There is virtually no crime, especially violent crime. There is no poverty.<p>In Austria the private funding of political campaigns is illegal. The government funds 100% of the costs. As a result, the government belongs to the people. In America, nothing short of a revolutionary civil war can eliminate the corruption of the government by wealthy individuals and corporations.<p>Quality of life has a high price that Americans are just not willing to pay.<p>&quot;Taxes are what we pay for civilized society&quot;\nUS Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.",1405762952

8057066,comment,8056978,8057056,12,0,marvin,,,"Atheists often bring up religion as a source of conflict, and there is some truth to this. But it isn&#x27;t the whole picture. Religion is often just another expression of cultural differences, which along with conflicts for resources is the biggest driver for conflict. Religion is just part of the package. A non-religious example which often shows up among atheists is feminism, which is really just an expression for different value systems and opinions about what constitutes a better world. Similar conflicts of morality and interest show up between people of differing religion as well, and don&#x27;t necessarily have anything to do with beliefs in different gods.<p>Remember, religion is deeply intertwined with culture and not a separate entity. In pre-scientific times, religion has also had an important role in bringing vital knowledge to the next generation (e.g. don&#x27;t eat pork in hot climates; don&#x27;t eat animals that have been dead for a long time).<p>We wouldn&#x27;t have world peace if everyone just became atheists tomorrow. There are too many interactions between religion and culture in general. If two cultures are compatible, it&#x27;s often because they interact a lot. If cultures interact a lot, they often end up with the same religion <i>anyway</i>. Etc. Remember, cultural boundaries are not static. Blaming religion above everything else betrays a limited understanding of the problem. It is really about communication, values and culture.",1405762060

8057057,comment,8056001,8056001,22,0,deadgrey19,,,"As context, I am a researcher in datacenter networks at a world renowned university. I&#x27;ve read the full research paper in detail, several times (not just the media summary) and have reviewed it carefully with other researchers in this area in our weekly reading group.<p>This first thing to note is that this is not &quot;done and dusted&quot; &quot;accepted as gospel truth&quot;. The work may have been accepted for publication at a top tier conference (and that&#x27;s fantastic!), but this means that only a small fraction of researchers have actually read that paper. Research publications are part of a conversation in the research community, an argument, and they should be read critically.<p>In that light, reading the work carefully, several things should be noted:<p>First the good stuff:<p>1) This work is incredibly well written. It&#x27;s easy to read, it&#x27;s sexy and it sells. This makes it easy for reviewers who often get a lot of poorly written work. A job well done by the writers.<p>2) In my (qualified) opinion, the reason that this work has been accepted for publication is that many in the community, including myself, would not have believed that a centralized arbiter could be be built, AT ALL. This is quite a novel thing. The idea is mad, and it seems to have worked.<p>Now the not so good stuff:<p>1) This paper is carefully craft to be slippery. You should be very careful about the claims that the authors make, in contrast to what you assume from the language used.<p>2) Fastpass is not &quot;zero queue&quot;. They simply move queuing into other places.  First, in the end host. When a host wants to transmit data, it must queue those packets and send a message to the arbiter to get a slot, it must then wait for a response, and then wait for a slot. Second in the arbiter itself,  the arbiter must be able to keep up. This is easy at low load, but these times get much longer at high load and larger systems.<p>3) The authors never measure or demonstrate the impact of this extra queuing at high load (or at any load) on the end-to-end latency. Using &quot;zero queue&quot; in the title, implies that latency in the system is better, and indeed the MIT sound byte assumes this, but it&#x27;s not measured or demonstrated anywhere. My guess is that the results just aren&#x27;t better. So they have focused on the things that look good, and not the dirty details. This seems disingenuous to me.<p>4) The Facebook implementation uses only 1 rack (at most about 100 machines, probably more like 40), which means that there is only ever 1 path that packets can take. This means that a significant part of their algorithm (calculating the right path) is never run, reducing the cost.<p>5) Despite this, the Facebook implementation shows almost no benefit. They manage to reduce the number of TCP retransmits from 4 per second down to 2 per second. They never discuss or demonstrate that this has any useful benefit, and, frankly, I&#x27;d be surprised if it did.<p>6) The headline number of reducing latency by 1000&#x27;s of percent is only in a contrived experiment with ping and iperrf, extreme ends of the latency throughput spectrum with little relation to the real world. This same result could have easily been achieved by simply setting ping to a high network priority.<p>7) There is no mention of tail latencies for realistic workloads, which is the real problem that is suggested in the solution but never demonstrated.<p>8) Scalability is a serious issue for this work, which the authors acknowledge, but will limit deployability.<p>9) Ultimately, this work is sexy and interesting, but never in the paper demonstrates any tangible benefit.",1405761319

Programming is more like chemistry or biology in the purity access...not &quot;like them&quot; but at a similar level.<p>Writing parsers, which I do a lot, requires very little parsing theory...ya, they make for good academic papers, but nothing beats good ole simple recursive descent in flexibility for error handling. And for register allocation, you might use - gasp - an algorithm, but that doesn&#x27;t dominate your work - writing a compiler involves some math (among other tasks), but is not mathematical activity.<p>Mathematicians can be bad or good at programming, just like musicians can be...there is no strong correlation to their aptitude based on their previous training.<p>> The root misunderstanding might be that most people wouldn&#x27;t know math if it hit them in the head, but changing my definition of math to fit their misconceptions is certainly not going to fix the problem.<p>Math can be defined so broadly as to basically be a useless word. Is sociology math? Is chemistry math? Is physics math? Is engineering math? Is implementing an algorithm math? Meh, if so, then whatever, we haven&#x27;t made any progress.",1405761139

It was also as role-playing friendly as any previous edition of D&D (which unfortunately isn&#x27;t saying much). I had much better role-playing experiences with 4e than I ever did with 3.5 or earlier.",1405760883

As soon as they spot your french (from France) accent, and it just starts by saying &quot;Bonjour&quot; , they become less friendly.

And the code often contains hooks that inject various things into the installation.<p>The other route in is through scripts like TimThumb, which is included in a lot of themes. TT has had some serious security holes in it, the last one being fairly recent that allows for remote file execution. At that point, at least the account hosting the file is a goner.",1405760413

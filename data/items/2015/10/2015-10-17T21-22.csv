Dedicated IPs are hard to beat if you have a steady traffic of high quality and low-latency delivery is a priority (think of PagerDuty). Most legit businesses/customers have that. Most likely they&#x27;re not offering dedicated IPs because they&#x27;re tough to get, especially if you are a small company in email business.<p>The reason Mailgun and Mandrill can do this is because they belong to much larger companies with better access to IPv4 stockpiles: Rackspace and Mailchimp.<p>Source: I worked at Mailgun.",1445119188

At the time I took the movie at face value wanting to be like Gillom learning to shoot. As an adult watching it I can see the truth of the story: the pain of an old man wanting to leave life in a manner of his choosing, and being disappointed that in the end he could not control it.<p>Sure, most of his characters were macho, misogynistic, and perhaps a touch racist, but was that his portrayal of the character drawn from his knowledge of what got him jobs, the writers, or perhaps both? Maybe he was simply the victim of type-casting. We see type-casting a lot these days: Keira Knightley seems stuck with period-piece roles, Jim Carrey is one of the go-to guys in the comedy realm, Jennifer Aniston is perpetually the ditsy girl, and it just goes on from there. Certain actors and actresses seem destined to play only a single type of role because of their looks. It&#x27;s as true then as it is now. You could argue that these people accept the roles so they&#x27;re as much to blame as the casting agents, but if the only roles they&#x27;re offered are these type-casted ones who&#x27;s really to blame? Sorry, I digress.<p>To me the story of Gran Torino is very similiar to that of The Shootist.  It&#x27;s been updated for the times, but at its core it&#x27;s still about an old man tutoring a young boy and choosing how he&#x27;ll die. Is the Clint Eastwood story better? I think that depends on who you ask. Is the character of Walt Kowalski better than J.B. Books? That depends on your definition of better.

The problem is the email recipient hosts are suspicious of the sender (as opposed to the message itself being suspicious). So the solution is to have a standardized way for senders to acquire an instantaneous reputation by tying their real-world identity to it (which lets them be held accountable if they do spam), and perhaps by throwing some money at it too. If there was some company that did identity checks, similar to how EV certificates are given out, then that ties your real-world identity to it (this could in fact be done by literally requiring an EV certificate for the hostname of the sender). This company could also take a decent-sized deposit (so you&#x27;re staking money on not being a spammer) and hold it in trust for a set amount of time. Once the time has passed, and you&#x27;ve sent enough emails for recipients to draw meaningful conclusions, if you have in fact not spammed, then you get your deposit back (minus a service fee). Then all the big email hosts would pay this company to query it about senders the host doesn&#x27;t already trust, and similarly they&#x27;d report any spam from these hosts back to the service.<p>Heck, this doesn&#x27;t even have to be a new company.

The conventional musical notation for a note with rich harmonic content, such as a single pluck of a guitar string, is not a vertical line on the staff with notes at every harmonic; instead, you just indicate the pitch of the fundamental.  (Even if the fundamental itself is mostly missing, like in the low notes on an upright piano, that&#x27;s where you put the note.)  Then, notes with different harmonic content (because they are played on different instruments) are plotted on different staffs, although this might be counterproductive for visualizing whale songs.  Colors are probably better for that.<p>It would be interesting to see if a second-order Markov model of the whale song unit sequence finds information that is not captured in a first-order model.  More interesting still would be if a stochastic context-free or pushdown model were able to predict whale songs better than a similarly-complex Markov model, as it would indicate that the whale song has a recursive structure, like human language.<p>It makes some sense that you would use a long, highly-redundant transmission of a sequence of discrete symbols, which then you would repeat after hearing, to distribute information of general interest around the ocean, where travel is slow and the latency-bandwidth product is high.

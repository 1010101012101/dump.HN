197762,comment,197182,197229,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I was just shopping today and found that a Lenovo T series can be had for about the same price (within $100, to one side or the other depending on specs) as a comparable Dell Latitude, and the Latitudes don't seem to be available with Linux (only three models can be had with Linux).  I'm using a Dell at the moment, and historically the price has always convinced me...but it seems like you can pretty much get a comparable Lenovo for about the same price as a Dell.  (And Lenovo also offers occasional coupon codes that keep them pretty competitive even if Dell offers slightly bigger special deals on occasion.)<p>Yeah, I'm as surprised as you are.",1211514653

Even mainstream-leaning ""tech"" sites like Wired or CNet haven't been covering the outages/scaling problems.<p>People who read sites like TechCrunch most definitely know what Twitter is, and coverage that talks about <i>why</i> they have scaling problems as opposed to making a soap opera about it is very useful for that demographic.",1211511602

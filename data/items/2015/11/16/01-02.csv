But we were drowned out by the excitement of people who didn&#x27;t seem to know any better.<p>It&#x27;s unpopular to say this but &quot;unlimited data&quot; is not necessarily a consumer-friendly policy. We talk about data caps like it&#x27;s a way to extort more money. But corporations have budgets they need to fill. If not data overages, they&#x27;d just raise your base plan pricing or add more fees. Unlimited data doesn&#x27;t really reduce how much consumers pay.<p>The difference... is how that money is distributed. For unlimited data plans, everyone pays the same. Which means the dude who torrents 50 gigs over 4G pays the same as my great aunt, who barely knows how to dial her phone. (But data plans are required for smartphones.)<p>Tiered data is the first step towards making people who use their service more, pay a larger share of the money that, let&#x27;s face it, our carrier is going to collect from us anyways. It&#x27;s just hard for many of us in the tech circle to accept that. Because we&#x27;re 1%ers. We use a disproportionately larger segment of data than everyone else. Should we pay more than people who barely use their phones? Absolutely.<p>I&#x27;m not saying carriers don&#x27;t overcharge, I&#x27;m not saying carriers don&#x27;t add a lot of unnecessary fees. I&#x27;m not saying we don&#x27;t have scary ISP monopolies in places where the government really should step in. But what I am saying is that metered data vs. unlimited data isn&#x27;t the fight we want to pretend it is. And &quot;unlimited data&quot; plans with their restrictions against hosting a server on wire lines or against tethering on wireless is distinctly opposed to the values of net neutrality. And setting aside what services are free to use and not free to use furthers that not net neutral goal.",1447638755

One quibble with a subpoint:<p>> As we know, the trolley problem has no ethically right solution- because in principle we can not weigh one life against another<p>That is not the current philosophical consensus.[1]<p>Notably, the trolley problem doesn&#x27;t ask you to weigh one life against another, but relies on the fairly unobjectionable premise that five deaths are worse than one death.<p>The trolley problem also involves an examination of the moral difference between action and inaction, which is probably irrelevant for a machine.<p>But the article is right that these situations are highly contrived and unlikely. The action &quot;brake as fast as possible to limit the force at the time of impact&quot; is probably always the best possible solution, or near enough.<p>The more likely dilemma autonomous vehicles will face is how much effort they should use to avoid rear-end collisions, but calibrations like that will probably become possible with autonomous vehicles, when we could never expect humans to have enough situational awareness to roll forward when safe to avoid rear ends.<p>[1] <a href=""http://philpapers.org/archive/BOUWDP"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philpapers.org/archive/BOUWDP</a>",1447638712

10572159,comment,10571065,10571508,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"NPM 2.x is actually very slow.<p>Part of that is just the monstrous number of files involved. For example, one of our projects has 48 dependencies, which installs 24,421 files under node_modules. NPM could probably benefit from managing each dependency as an archive.<p>We do atomic deploys and try to make them reproducible, so for each deploy we do a fresh install from npm-shrinkwrap.json, but even when all the modules are in NPM&#x27;s local cache it&#x27;s very slow at copying everything.<p>Unfortunately, NPM doesn&#x27;t version the node_modules folder (a package becomes ./node_modules/mypackage/...)), so you can&#x27;t reuse it. The NPM cache <i>is</i> versioned ($cachedir/mypackage/3.23/...), but can&#x27;t be used directly. It would be much better to skip the cache altogether, and have node_modules embed version strings (./node_modules/mypackage-3.23/...). Then you could easily share the folder across builds.<p>NPM is also pretty brittle. We frequently have deploys fail because of transient network errors (repository timing out or similar) that cause NPM to fall over. The dreaded mysterious &quot;npm ERR cb() never called&quot; error still hits us weekly.<p>(Speaking of reproducible builds: NPM lets people unpublish packages. Sometimes old versions just disappear, presumably because they were unpublished. 6 months later you want to deploy a certain app, and you find it depends on some package X, which deep in its dependency graph relies on package Y 0.3, but 0.3 is gone from npmjs.com, so you have to upgrade for no reason at all.)",1447638323

Once you have little ones, working from home becomes an incredible benefit. Obviously for females it&#x27;s advantageous, but for males as well.<p>For example, I work full time from home and am able to drop my elementary school daughter to school and pick her up at arbitrary times of day (15 mins. round trip) while my spouse is off at her day job which is in a classroom and thus has rigid scheduling.<p>It makes it possible for my wife to work.  It also means I can skip the shower and &quot;business casual&quot; dress-up ritual every morning.  I typically work all morning in my pajamas/sweats, throw on running shorts and head out at lunch time for a quick noon time run, knock off around 5 or 6pm and throw some dinner together.<p>I&#x27;m in nearly constant contact with my teammates and management using skype chat and email.  Occasionally, Webex conference calls with customers.  Once in a while we screen share.  (pro tip:  You should disable Chrome browser&#x27;s Gmail popup notifications if you are screen-sharing with your boss <i>and</i> you tend to get a lot of email from recruiters....)<p>Then there is the quiet, the ability to step outside for 3 minutes and breath the fresh air, make your own coffee or drink of choice and not have to settle for the office Keurig or institutional drip brewer.  My preference has long been a French press and freshly ground beans -- though lately it&#x27;s been chai tea -- easy at home, a pain to set up at an office.<p>The work-from-home option is truly a great advancement if you have a complicated home life, such as children.  You can also take the laptop and pretty much work from anywhere; I frequently take the family on vacation and just work 9-5, saving my real time off for other occasions.<p>Certainly, it&#x27;s &quot;not for everyone&quot; -- especially, I would think, for 20-somethings who are recent grads and still socializing into the work environment, or for people in some kind of tight work loop where the shoulder-to-shoulder approach is necessary, and the 5-minutes-in-the-hallway is critical for random idea vetting and brainstorming.",1447637886

10572132,comment,10571743,10571743,0,0,AaronBBrown,,,"By now, I have spent more than half of my 15+ year professional career as a remote employee.  My first job, back in 2000 was as a developer working for a Boston-based company from my apartment in upstate NY.  We exchanged source code via CD in the mail, used a telephone and screen shared with Microsoft Netmeeting.  That... was hard.<p>Several companies later, I find it actually difficult to work in an office environment.  I&#x27;m not a hermit or even a strong introvert.  I enjoy the company of other people from all walks of life, but there are so many distractions in an office environment that prevents me from doing my best work.  As a Technical Operations engineer (SysEng, DevOps, SRE, or buzzword-dujour), most of my work is contemplative and best performed away from a keyboard.  At home, I am free to work while running, walking, or sitting in the bathtub (TMI) with no fear of judgement from my peers. When I do need access to someone, I have a variety of tools at my disposal to suit the required latency and interactivity of the conversation.<p>Plus, pants are optional and slippers are the prescribed footware.<p>There are always challenges, though.  For me, strict enforcement of work hours is a must.  Sometimes I still get in the zone, lose track of time and work late, but usually I sit down around 9AM and take off around 5-6PM.  Otherwise, work takes over my life and I end up neglecting my responsibilities as a husband, father, and homeowner.  I am lucky to have a wife who understands my work boundaries and children who have never known a father who leaves the house for work each day.  &quot;Daddy is working&quot; is enough for them to get them out of my office. Oddly, I grew up in a similar environment, as my father worked from a home office when I was a kid.<p>The biggest challenge for me has been while working for a medium-sized (1000+ employee) company in a Director role for a mostly colocated company.  As an individual contributor, communication with my team and boss is relatively easy, but as a leader it is incredibly difficult to inject myself into important conversations via chat and email when those people are literally sitting next to each other.  Having trusted &quot;spies&quot; within the organization that will keep their ears open and report back is a must or else you end up completely out of the loop.<p>Having worked primarily at colocated companies where I&#x27;m in the minority as a remote employee, I&#x27;m very excited to be joining an established remote first company next year and seeing how they do it in the &quot;big leagues.&quot;",1447637592

I&#x27;m writing them to try to get language designers to design DSLs more often.&quot;<p>I was actually baiting you to blast you given I guessed the answer to number 1. However, I decided against it since you have the more reasonable position of identifying the problem then pushing responsibility onto language designers rather than users. Many posts seem other way around. So, that&#x27;s refreshing. :)<p>&quot;There are rare occasions I see DSLs used to fulfill these roles, and it&#x27;s to great benefit.&quot;<p>I agree. iMatix, REBOL/RED, and LISP community (esp Racket) have shown it consistently in terms of productivity and reliability with performance being better sometimes. True even for general-purpose, systems programming: see Ivory langauge from Galois.<p>&quot;SMC rather than hand-coding stuff as C++ boilerplate. Same with using a process coordinator like Erlang&#x27;s OTP (which isn&#x27;t a DSL but is close enough).&quot;<p>OTP as a coordinator DSL I haven&#x27;t thought about. Might look into it to see if there&#x27;s design wisdom to learn for a future DSL outside of Erlang.<p>&quot;I&#x27;m writing them to try to get language designers to design DSLs more often.&quot;<p>I know there&#x27;s been some good books and essays on how to best design DSL&#x27;s. Most of us don&#x27;t know which ones are the good ones. Do you have any links for me or others following along on that? I figure the old wisdom augmented with lessons learned from LANGSEC stuff will be a good start.<p>&quot; This is exactly as it should be, since Coq is focused precisely on the domain of functional algorithms (and proofs). And, I have found that, within that domain, the restriction that all my algorithms must provably terminate is nearly invisible.&quot;<p>Wait, are we discussing avoiding Turing completeness or requirements for a termination proof? Termination proofs are done on code in Turing complete languages many times a year in academia. Harder than Coq model of an algorithm for sure but way more useful. I&#x27;ll just let you elaborate on why you focused on that point.<p>So, trying to cut through the fog that remains, would you say a good approach is using a language like Haskell or ML that compiles to System F (Turing incomplete) with DSL&#x27;s where possible? Aside from your DSL point, is building on or alternatives to things like System F what you would like to see?<p>&quot; Turing-completeness is not a feature I need in a programming language.&quot;<p>Curious, how do you handle I/O and other OS interaction without making it so complex a new programmer must learn Haskell, monads, etc?

It looks like the Global Reserve got introduced in ~3.16, so it&#x27;s not likely related to that. Maybe you hit a hard-link limit or had <i>really</i>, <i>really</i> large xattrs attached to files or something? (I <i>do</i> know that btrfs has (had?) a <i>surprisingly</i> low limit on the number of hard links supported in a volume, but I have <i>no</i> idea how hitting that limit presents itself.)<p>Do you remember if you let the system idle for a few minutes and tried your operation again? (Not that that&#x27;s a reliable [or even reasonable] solution, mind, but does provide a useful piece of diagnostic info.)<p>In the <i>distant</i> past, running a balance on empty chunks (in order to free them and free up otherwise unused metadata space) was one recommended way to work around mysterious ENOSPC issues.

You pointed out Java as a straight win for both variant of Pascal philosophy and maintainability. I countered that this wasn&#x27;t true given Java was inefficient for over a decade, very hard to port, bloated, hard to understand, and anything but easy to maintain. I gave counter-example of Modula line, esp Modula-3, that was easy to totally understand, consistent, fast to compile, easy to port, cpu/space efficient, and supported most features industry needed for programming in the large. Java got popular due to social and political reasons on top of massive financial push by Sun. It&#x27;s technically crap. Latest Modula-like language is Go and most Java programmers experimenting with it write like it&#x27;s a breath of fresh air. That&#x27;s due to Java problems more than Go strengths but Go embodying Pascal line&#x27;s good traits helps.<p>Although, there&#x27;s irony in you citing Java while critiquing LISP: Java co-author, Guy Steele, said one of Java&#x27;s successes was dragging some C++ developers half-way to the capabilities of LISP. Implies he knew both technically inferior to LISP even when designing Java to replace C++. ;)<p>&quot;Do we really wish HTML were Turing complete? LaTex gotta be Turing complete? The author isn&#x27;t really saying everything has to be underpowered and take 2000 lines to do what 100 lines of Python can do.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m sorry to deliver the news but the fools did it anyway:<p><a href=""http://lemire.me/blog/2011/03/08/breaking-news-htmlcss-is-turing-complete/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lemire.me/blog/2011/03/08/breaking-news-htmlcss-is-tu...</a><p>Also, representing HTML actually takes less in Scheme due to HTML&#x27;s complexity and redundancy. Same for XML. See here:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SXML"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SXML</a><p>That&#x27;s not your point, though, so I&#x27;ll focus on it. We have two major approaches we take here: a limited language like HTML that&#x27;s not Turing complete and which we extend all around with Turing complete languages; a Turing complete language with a subset, even equivalent to HTML, that&#x27;s not Turing complete but lets you have a great, highly-integrated & client/server-consistent language when you need that. Simplest version of the 2nd category is one of the Scheme web application systems that leverage a form of HTML with ability to transform and present it only limited by Scheme&#x27;s power. Use simple version if you can then use Scheme otherwise. Can do something similar with function calls in other languages that correspond to HTML, building up an AST to output static or dynamic content.<p>&quot;&quot;Right tool for the job&quot; is the slogan that could defuse about 90% of the language wars. Instead of saying &quot;HTML is better than Lisp&quot; and trying to start a flame war, I could notice that sometimes I just want to mark some stuff up. I don&#x27;t always want to debug my text.&quot;<p>I try to avoid them and convey information instead. My point the whole Turing complete vs incomplete is kind of a false dichotomy where we can&#x27;t have both. HTML can be a DSL and <i>is in many real works</i>. LISP isn&#x27;t required there although macros & easy parsing are a <i>great aid</i> in any language for DSL&#x27;s. Rebol, Forth, and Julia can do it that I&#x27;m aware of. That almost nobody uses pure HTML w/ no server-side anymore shows it wasn&#x27;t adequate. Led to proliferation of worst stack of Turing complete crap I&#x27;ve ever seen with a few exceptions sprinkled in.<p>So, what to learn from the mess and how to do it better next time? A powerful client- and server-side language with easy syntax + HTML DSL seems like it would&#x27;ve been the best option. Was done by certain groups in fact while delivering on its goals. Let&#x27;s one default on safe & simple while incrementally adding on with consistency, performance, and power [where necessary]. Or an integration of a bunch of Turing incomplete DSL&#x27;s for the crowd that loves those.",1447635964

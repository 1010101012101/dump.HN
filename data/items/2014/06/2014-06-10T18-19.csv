There is that little black stick on the top right of the canvas, wonder what that is? Maybe there is a mirror at the end of it ;) It would be funny if the evidence for all this was sitting in plain view for a few hundred years but likely there is a more ordinary explanation for that stick, maybe someone with more experience in painting can chip in about what that is.<p>The about box at the bottom lists Tim as the guy behind DigiPaint of Amiga fame, and his company is also the one behind LightWave 3D.",1402426770

Is the Linux VFS that slow?<p>In terms of transaction guarantees, I thought the commenter was talking about the newer model where each profile is an independent (and tiny) file; if that&#x27;s the case, then deleting and renaming files wouldn&#x27;t be necessary, and any failures in writing could be rolled back in the journal rather than be a file that&#x27;s now non-existent or renamed.

7874591,comment,7874141,7874141,1,0,tubbzor,,,"I&#x27;ll go ahead and throw my 2 cents your way since I just graduated last month (and will be back for grad school in the Fall). I think our perceptions on the whole &quot;college experience&quot; is different now but I was a lot like you when I got to school too.<p>In short, I mainly kept to myself within the CS department. While I had friends there, my relationship with them was majorly school-based. My girlfriend and guys I hung out with on a regular basis were all in different fields but that never bothered me because we still all had a blast. I worked on personal projects and homeworks mostly by myself, but I personally preferred it that way because it was so much more rewarding to me to do it that way than to have someone else walk me through it. So, was this solidarity beneficial to me? I think it was for me but could see how others may want more. One thing I did do was find a few professors I really respected and talked to on a regular basis which I think was more beneficial to me than most peer interactions.<p>On another note here is something to think about Facebook: You only see what everyone wants you to see about them. Kids in college largely have the same mindset as you...they want to be having the best time of their life, so you can be sure that is how they perceive themselves on social media and crop their content to fit that. I can remember countless parties where a large group of people walk in, pose against the crowd and take pictures, then leave. Maybe they go hang out somewhere else or maybe they go home, but you can be sure the next morning they all have those pictures all over Facebook showing &#x27;what a great time&#x27; they had. Personally, after my sophomore year I stopped using Facebook all together and only get on when I have an email notification I need to attend to.<p>What kind of clubs and social life are you looking for? If you have a strong CS dept, it is likely your professors head their own research groups for their field and would at least let you come to the meetings if not participate in the research yourself if you showed some initiative. If you are really unhappy I&#x27;d consider transferring but only after you&#x27;re sure that what you are looking for isn&#x27;t available where you are. Sometimes you just have to look a little harder and put yourself out there.",1402426636

And if your coding style doesn&#x27;t distinguish between an actual network link and an imaginary in-process link (or worse, deliberately makes them indistinguishable and silently interchangeable), sooner or later someone will refactor it or change the config file or something and your microsecond-scale latency that you were assuming and relying on has suddenly become multiple-millisecond latency and everything grinds to a halt.",1402426510

7874582,comment,7872661,7874066,7,0,anigbrowl,,,"It&#x27;s the corner of the carpet on the floor tile - the one farthest from us, not the one in the foreground of the painting. I work in film and one thing cinematographers love doing is shooting into mirrors, so I&#x27;ve gotten used to checking them for continuity purposes :)<p>As for the dimensions of the room, being &#x27;wrong&#x27;, that may be deliberate. Again in film props and furniture are adjusted out of their natural position surprisingly often, in pursuit of aesthetic harmony. If you analyzed an interior scene that had been shot from multiple angles in hopes of mapping the room&#x27;s contents accurately, you&#x27;d be disappointed to discover that many things had changed position by ~10% of their own size from shot to shot. Part of the craft is the ability to look at the image on a tiny monitor and be able to identify whatever it is that is distracting your eye from where you&#x27;re supposed to be looking, like a table which looks fine in one shot but feels too small following a change in the focal length of the camera lens for a different shot. Solution - move the table towards the lens a bit.<p>Don&#x27;t even get me started on lighting and related tricks, which can further mess up your spatial intuition. For example, a very common and cheap effect is to make a room feel bigger by painting adjacent walls slightly different shades of the same color. Lots of these techniques are stolen from painting, where the deliberate falsification of perspective has long been used for both aesthetic and semantic effect.

So the question is which...<p>If you understand the central idea of Haxl, I don&#x27;t know of any other language that would let you do what Haxl in Haskell does. The built in language support for building DSLs (hijacking the operators including applicative/monadic operations) -really- shines in this case. I would -love- to see haxl-like implicit concurrency in other languages that feel as natural and concise. Consider that a challenge. I thought about trying to do it in C++ for edification/pedagogical purposes but it&#x27;s an absolutely brutal mess of templates and hackery. There may be a better way, though.",1402426129

7874496,comment,7873696,7873696,2,0,stcredzero,,,"Cargo drones have interesting implications. When the requirement of a human pilot or crew/passengers of any kind at all disappears, the possible form factors increase greatly. So, just a wild first-draft brainstorm here: How about quadcopter drones that take off and rendezvous with an overhead aircraft? Perhaps they deploy a drogue chute or streamer drogue in front of the craft, which is equipped with something like the Fulton surface-to-air recovery system:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_surface-to-air_recovery_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_surface-to-air_recovery_...</a><p>(Similar devices have already been used to retrieve satellites that have reentered the atmosphere.) Once the mother aircraft retrieves its assigned drones, it stores them away, climbs to 50,000 feet, orients itself, then fires rockets to put it on a suborbital trajectory. On such a trajectory, the mother aircraft could reach any point on the globe in under 2 hours.<p>After the mother craft has reentered, it returns to a normal aircraft flight regime, then releases the quadcopter drones to fly directly to their delivery coordinates. Voila: same day point to point (city to city) small parcel delivery anywhere in the world. (Perhaps even same morning or same afternoon.)<p>Obviously, there are a lot of potential problems. Lots more organizations besides the FAA would have to get involved. The system described above doesn&#x27;t take into account international customs and the spread of invasive species. There is the potential that people would try to use the system to deliver bombs. Also, suborbital craft of such capabilities are basically ICBMs. Such concerns would mean that the mother craft would have to land at an airport and the cargo drones inspected before they are sent to their destinations. It might be better to have the mother aircraft remove a cargo pack then drop the drones, which would float away on the streamer drogue, re-furl the drogue and resume powered flight back to base. This would save the weight of the drone for the suborbital flight. Then customs could proceed at the destination country mostly as usual, then the small parcels could be re-dispatched on a different set of drones, or proceed by conventional delivery. (Which, by then, could be a self driving vehicle.)",1402425693

With drones, it is hard to see the drones from planes and drones can&#x27;t see planes either.<p>Not to mention the enforcement part. All planes today have a call sign and FAA/NTSB can easily go after pilots when rules are broken. This is an important part of the overall safety architecture.

But if you actually have to implement a kernel, you can&#x27;t do it in Python or Matlab.<p>Regarding assembly: I still believe that assembly is unsuitable except for the simplest of algorithms. Sure, you can optimize the crap out of DGEMM or DAXPY, with SIMD, cache-optimization, and prefetching – but in the end, it&#x27;s still a very simple algorithm, with a very simple data layout and predictable access patterns. But as soon as it gets a little more complex (e.g., graph algorithms, or a SAT solver), you can forget about assembly.

If you could meet those four things, then I don&#x27;t see why you&#x27;d need to have a commercial restriction.

But at the end of the weeklong study their reaction times were slower when they had to put their newfound knowledge to use to solve a new task that they hadn’t seen during the training sessions. ”They had trouble accessing what they’d learned,” Cohen Kadosh said.<p>> The volunteers who had the prefrontal area involved in learning and memory stimulated showed the opposite pattern. They were slower than the control group to learn the new numerical system, but they performed faster on the new test at the end of the experiment. The bottom line, says Cohen Kadosh, is that stimulating either brain region had both benefits and drawbacks. ”Just like with drugs, there seem to be side effects,” he said.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2013/03/cognitive-enhancement/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2013/03/cognitive-enhancement/</a>",1402424992

He could have used various off-the-shelf technologies and most people would not have objected particularly - for example, anyone with a basic interest in science knows that Galileo was using telescopes to make astronomical observations several centuries before Vermeer, so the notion of moderately good lenses being available by the 17th century would not be strange. Indeed, the producers could probably have sourced lenses of similar vintage on the antique market or with the cooperation of a museum.

So, I encourage you to be extra skeptical about my critique.<p>However, when it comes to investing with someone, my biggest concern is trust. I am a long term investor, so I am not terribly concerned with management fees. Rather, I am looking for trust. Not only trust that you won&#x27;t steal from me, but trust that you will do a relatively good job of managing my investments.<p>Unfortunately, this website and the signup process both severely eroded my trust. First, other people have mentioned this, but it has not been fixed so I will reiterate. This entire website needs to be https! Since it isn&#x27;t https (and you still haven&#x27;t fixed the link to the signup page), I have concerns over how you store and secure the data that you collect.<p>Second, I notice that you use Google Analytics and you collect some very personal information that you will no doubt use for marketing purposes. For example, in your risk assessment, you ask what I would do if my portfolio lost ~ 30% of its value over three months. Are you using this information to determine how much risk I can stomach, or are you using it to know when to market to me? Despite this level of information and the questions it creates, I cannot find a privacy policy. Your site has a terms of service, but it is a .pdf and, call me paranoid, but I am extra careful with .pdf documents.<p>Technically, since your site doesn&#x27;t have a privacy policy, you&#x27;re violating Google Analytics&#x27; terms of service. Your privacy policy may be included in your terms of service, so I could be completely wrong.<p>Third, call me paranoid, but in light of these issues, I have some concerns investing with a company that is seemingly run by an MBA student, especially one with an interest in starting &#x27;disruptive companies&#x27;. My current advisor and I have been friends for 14 years, he has been in the business for 10 years, and he has no plans to retire until around the time that I will (hopefully) retire myself. I am a long term investor, so I am looking for an advisor who is just as interested in a long term relationship. You might be, but nothing on your website makes me feel confident that you will be doing this in ten years.<p>Finally, when I read your FAQ page, I noticed that if I want to see my portfolio, I have to log into Motif. Since I could use Motif myself, control my own portfolio, and not have to worry that I&#x27;ll stop managing my own portfolio, it seems like I might be better served by signing up with Motif.<p>You have an excellent idea and I like how much work you have already done to execute on it.

There is more to performance than memory layout and caching.<p>There is a big difference between optimization in the small and optimization in the large. It is precisely because you need maximum performance and correctness that you need high-level languages. Quite ironically your comment itself illustrates the point well. One could have written high-perf apps entirely in the style of OpenBlas. Sensible people dont and for a reason.<p>I am going to copy a previous comment of mine on this topic.<p>--<p>I will not be surprised if it beats C by generating C code itself, but C code that no human would write by hand.

Imperative code is a lot harder to reason about, and low level code is a lot harder to write if one cares about correctness and performance simultaneously. Specialized functional languages has a history of beating C implementations. It could be faster still if one removes the constraint that one has to generate C code, for example coroutines and proper tail calls become easier to implement. The bottomline is that correctness is easier to achieve with functional, and performance with imperative. So we would need both and they meet in a compiler.<p>Take the example of Stalin and StalinGrad, they are Lisps. Their compile times are epic, but once done they have a history of generating faster code than C for specific applications (a specific example where it will excel is multidimensional numeric integration where the function to be integrated is passed as an input). The main reason why they would be able to generate faster code is that they are smarter about inlining. The reason they are smarter about inlining is that programmers intent is better preserved when encoded in a higher level language.<p>Can a programmer not write the same correct code in C by hand ? Perhaps they can, but it will take longer and would be more error prone and likely to be costlier to produce, unless one takes the help of these higher level abstractions primitives, but then you aren&#x27;t really writing in C anymore. Can the C compiler not be equally smart ? possibly, but it will be a lot harder to make a C compiler smart than a functional language compiler smart. Functional languages leave a lot of room for the compiler to do its thing, C while not as bad as Java still over-specifies how exactly something needs to be computed (my way or the highway). Add the fact that when code is written in a higher level, but optimization friendly language one can enjoy the benefits of compiler techniques yet to come. It future-proofs the code to an extent and amortizes the effort that went into writing the compiler.",1402424102

It doesn't work in an Indian environment where companies and jobs depend on what your under graduate college is and your qualification. Companies only visit BIG and reputed colleges and no matter how bad you are, you might be lucky in getting selected for the job. That is what you are paying for, its for that damn job and not for the research and education.<p>But I think you are going in the right direction. If I look back at myself 4 years ago, I am in the same position as yours. Its good that you are looking at the MIT and Stanford's courses. They help you a lot in learning new concepts. Also make yourself comfortable with programming. at the end of the day, it boils down to how good you can apply your concepts and code stuff. Find some interesting projects on Github. Fork it and work on it. you might not be successful at your first attempt. But you will learn a lot of things on your way. Involve yourself in various open source projects and hackers club in your local city and I'm sure you will be successfull.",1322585880

3291051,comment,3289750,3290559,9,0,HedgeMage,,,"It's <i>definitely</i> a function of social conditioning -- how else would it vary so much based on the community in which one is raised?<p>When it comes to salary negotiations, most lower-SEC (socio-economic class) country women I know will counter their first offer.  Getting more than the initial offer makes them feel respected; they want to see that the employer wants them enough to make a concession.  Most higher-SEC urban and suburban women I know won't ask -- they'll take or turn down the initial offer, but they tell me that asking for more money would make them look whiny and high-maintenance.<p>Growing up in the country, being able to haggle was a badge of honor.  One haggles (or at least asks about discounts/freebies) everywhere from garage sales to car dealerships to the local fabric store.  I cannot tell you how many times as a child I heard my mother, grandmother, and aunts say ""it never hurts to ask"".  It's considered mostly a woman thing there -- I get funny looks from the men for teaching my 8yo son to haggle, but my male friends ask me to come shopping with them to handle negotiations.<p>The women I know from the techie world (all from higher-SEC and more urban backgrounds than I) may look for advertised sales, but haggling or asking for discounts not offered is seen as showing weakness/looking poor.  When I go ahead and haggle around them, they say things like ""I cannot believe you just said that!"" or ""You are embarrassing me, we don't need a discount that badly, we can afford this.""<p>As adults, we seem to translate that consumer experience to how we approach salary negotiations.  Both groups pursue the strategy that they were raised to believe shows confidence and strength.<p>My advice: if you want your daughter (or son) to negotiate a higher salary as an adult, teach her (or him) to haggle young.  That garage sale where she/he asks ""If I buy all twelve of these books [marked 50 cents each], would you sell the lot for five dollars?"" will eventually become
""Would you consider 70k/year?"" (in response to an offer for 55).",1322585737

It does. There is an exemption for American citizens from the mandatory detention requirement (section 1032 of the bill), but no exemption for American citizens from the authorization to use the military to indefinitely detain people without charge or trial (section 1013 of the bill). So, the result is that, under the bill, the military has the power to indefinitely imprison American citizens, but it does not have to use its power unless ordered to do so.<p>But you dont have to believe us.

By design! That's what all this ""minimum viable product"" talk is about.<p>The canonical example might be Twitter. There's absolutely no question that their initial Rails-based infrastructure was not up to the task of running Twitter. But it <i>was</i> up to the task of running Twitter <i>for a few thousand users</i>, long enough to prove that they really needed a better, custom, designed-and-maintained-in-house-by-an-expensive-team-of-hardworking-experts architecture, which they then built, using money raised on the strength of the initial hack.<p>And it's absolutely true that businesses built on half-assed hacks generally aren't viable in the long-term. But most businesses aren't viable, period. The trick is to upgrade the viability of the codebase as the business continues to prove itself. Nobody said that this was easy to get right, and you can fall behind (""OMG our codebase is horrible and the fail whale has its own fan club""), or you can get too far ahead (""OMG we spent a fortune overengineering our product""), and sometimes you <i>don't even know</i> whether you are ahead or behind, but that is the game.<p>Meanwhile, let's not get completely stuck on businesses. There's room in life for half-assed mashups that cannot possibly ""work"" long-term, but are a lot of fun. Even before Twitter was a rickety service with a dozen public users, it was a hilarious idea with no public users at all. The toy stage is important too.",1322585237

3291009,story,,,1,0,erikb,"What you probably forgot about models",,"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3289839<p>In this linked post there is a lot of discussion about wether knowing about a father who has a child, which is a son and was born on tuesday, leads to a different probability for this father's second child being a son or a daughter.<p>I really want to make a point here and please stick to the end before you start commenting, because I will say that you (yes you!) are wrong.<p>Some answered with P(child_2=boy)=0.5 because boys and girls are both equally likely and knowing anything about the other children of this father is quite unimportant. Another group said P(child_2=boy)=1/3, because this father has 2 children with each being a boy or a girl and u can already discount both being a girl, because he said he has at least one son. For more details read the comments and blog post which are all possible to find under the link above. The third statement is, that P(child_2=boy)=13/27, doing the same as the P=1/3 guys but adding the weekdays in the same way and then excluding the impossible cases according to what the father said.<p>Each of these groups discusses that their probability is better then the other 2. So which one is right? I tell you that all groups are wrong and all probabilities are wrong. The reason is, all groups don't know which is true and if the child is a boy or not. The thing is that they just model this uncertainty using probability theory. So all of them are models. And what do we know about models? Models are all wrong, because they always generalize the real world. If you would have a really correct model, it would be the real world itself.<p>On the other hand also all 3 probabilities are good and correct to use. Because they all help us to make any assumption at all about wether the second child is a boy or not. All 3 answers are better then ""I don't know"" and depending on how well you argue which model, all 3 of them are also mathematically correct.<p>So instead of arguing that your number is better then the others and that your truth is more true then the truth of the others (isn't that called religion), you should understand from this kind of question that probability is just a model, which has it's flaws and it's advantages.<p>That said I think it is practically better to underfit (=use less information then you could) then to overfit (=use data that actually doesn't improve your knowledge, which is misleading), why I would, in a real life application, use the 0.5 until I know I really have a situation which allows me to infer more, because given different equally likely models, it is best to use the simplest one (google ""Occam's Razor"".)<p>And that is actually already all that is to such kind of problem. If you can't understand the math well enough to get to ALL THREE probabilities, then you should study probability more deeply before you start arguing. If you think one of them is better then the others, then you might be great at math but you don't understand the basic philosophy of every scientist and engineer (your model is always wrong). And last but not least you should become a theoretical scientist if you don't understand Occam's Razor.<p>Thanks, you are a very patient reader and I'm proud of you.

Once they can get you to agree to one number, they still have room to pressure you on some of the other parts of the deal.  Luckily you can do the exact same thing to them by presenting a range of demands (base, bonus, vacation, perks) without tipping your hand and letting them know which ones mean the most to you personally.  It's especially helpful to be able to weigh their benefit details against your current position without having to directly disclose your salary.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.beinggeek.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.beinggeek.com</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.edmunds.com/car-loan/four-square-basics.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edmunds.com/car-loan/four-square-basics.html</a>",1322584129

1) Create a list of new music releases, and grab the links to amazon.
2) Create a mechanism that allowed me to support ""people"" that I enjoy their work of.<p>With those two things in mind I created numuboard.com<p>Thing 1:
numuboard.com compiles list of new music releases and places with product links to amazon.  There are currently no reviews, ratings, or prices listed on numuboard.com.  My personal shopping habits are such that I don't need to see other peoples opinions.  If there is a new Pavement album released, I'm going to buy it.<p>Thing 2:
I had previously hardcoded a selection of amazon affiliate links that went to various ""people"" on the internet in order to make it easy for everyone to support those people.  After some conversation, I've since removed that feature and changed it so that you can just pass your affiliate code to the site by means of numuboard.com?tag=amazonaffiliatetag<p>If you have the time, I'd love feedback on the following:

are things like Price, Ratings, Reviews keep you from using this site?

But if the younger son is a boy, then the GB possibility is removed, so it's 1/2 on the older son - BB or BG.<p>In your case, your younger kid is a son born on xDay.  If you assume you will have another kid, chances on being a son are still 50%.  It only gets interesting if either kid could have been a son.<p>In Monty Hall, the info that you don't intuitively consider is that Monty is providing additional information.  You think of it as 50/50 because Monty ruled out a goat and car has to be behind one of two remaining doors, but actually the way it works is you chose a door that 1/3rd had a car, leaving 2/3rds chance of car on the other two doors.  Then Monty eliminated one of those two doors, still leaving 2/3rds chance of car on the remaining door.  So you should switch to that door.

Slightly off topic but bear with it...<p>When the HP driver software compiles the file code to send to the printer it also encodes other information. I discovered this because I found out it that the system date of the pc gets encoded along with the print data. More shockingly, prior to encoding the file, the printer checks the ""best before date"" of each cartridge and compares it to the system date. If your cartridge is beyond the date HP would like you to use it by, it introduces artifacts into the print and the issues a ""beware you printer could malfunction with out of date cartridges"" message.<p>Simple work around, change your system date to some time in the past before your cartridge expiry date, and hey presto your HP printer starts to work again. Change it back to the present and all of a sudden the artifacts and message appear.<p>If HP can mess with your PDF pre-print, then so can someone else. Personally, I love my HP printer. I just hate what HP do to try to force you to buy more ink. Whenever have non-perishable goods required a ""use by"" date?",1322583444

So a 300 sq foot room for $650/mo isn't going to cut it (as someone else suggested).<p>Looks like Gilroy might be a good answer.  Over 100 properties on Realtor.com between $250 and 400K.  42 miles from Silicon Valley.<p><a href=""http://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Gilroy_CA/beds-3#/price-250000-400000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Gilroy_CA/b...</a>",1322582456

I've gotten a good amount of free food (appetizers and desserts mostly) just by asking for it, as well as fairly large discounts.  It works amazingly well.<p>Yet when it came to salary negotiation for my first (and current job, I was too scared to ask for more because I didn't think I held any cards.  I was fresh out of college with no internships and from a pretty mediocre school, and in an area with close to 0 software companies.  I know everyone says that they won't take an offer away because you asked for more, but it felt too important to chance it.  In the future however I don't ever plan on just taking the initial offer.",1322582454

Nobody will ever follow you out of an interview to beg you to take a job, or casually double a salary offer in a stairwell.<p>There is no ""hard ball"" negotiating like this where you walk out and somehow bring a company to its knees. It's just never that dramatic.<p>IF you receive a concrete job offer then you accept, decline, or counter. You should know the pay range by the time a company puts an actual offer on paper.",1322582434

But I would think that the ""I would like a raise"" discussion would be easier than the ""I'm leaving"" discussion.",1322582413
3290803,comment,3289750,3290733,4,0,danssig,,,">I find switching jobs painful and stressful<p>This is just because you don't do it enough.  I used to hate it enough that I once sued a company to try and make them not lay me off.  Now I change every 16mo-5 years and I <i>love</i> the interview part.  I would never stay <i>anywhere</i> (besides my own company) for more than 5 years as IMO it makes you appear not very sought after.<p>>and my largest percentage salary increases have come without switching employers.<p>I find this <i>very</i> hard to believe.  All companies have caps on how much of an increase you can get per year, per performance raise, etc.  When you move it's mostly dependent on your negotiation skills (which get better the more they're used).  The biggest raise I ever got in a company was during the dot com bubble (they were afraid we would leave).  I got 28% (massive, massive exception to get this.  Performance raises were the highest you could normally get and were capped at 15%).  I moved to another company a few years later and more than doubled my salary.  My latest move brought me another 40%.<p>>and assumed the strategy in question would be blindly applied by an ignorant worker and result in exploitation.<p>Everywhere I've ever worked was this way.",1322582403

All of the rest have no long-term performance record to draw from, or are based on a single country's current activity.  To avoid single-country currency manipulations, choose the Euro.  I don't think the US Govt has repudiated any debt to date, which gives large-scale investors some comfort (although this is backwards- not forward-looking).<p>However, the customer base tends to be in USD or Euro (particularly the former).  Thus, there is an argument for dealing in USD so as to sell to those dealing in USD.",1246816718

688497,comment,687612,688344,0,0,solutionyogi,,,"Wow. You left me speechless. In your earlier post, you mentioned that Government excels at wasting the taxpayer's money and you still want to give them money for the 'common good'. [Personally, I am scared of everyone who talks about common good.]<p>Have you ever thought about why government wastes money? As Milton Friedman put is succinctly,<p>There are 3 ways to spend money.\n1. Your money on yourself. [e.g. buying a car for yourself]\n2. Your money on someone else. [e.g. buying a birthday gift for your friend.]\n3. Someone else's money on someone else. [Your beloved government.]<p>Ask yourself, out of these 3 scenarios, which one will get you the most bang for the buck? Yes, scenario 1, where you make sure that you get most out of your hard earned money. And you can bet that there will be tremendous waste of money in scenario 3, no exceptions.<p>So my friend, tell me, why should I give my hard earned money to Government when I know that it will be wasted?<p>Keeping the waste argument aside, let me talk about your comment that you think you are terrible at using your own money. Have you thought that not everyone thinks that they are not good with their money? [e.g. I think I am good at managing my money]. Just because you are not, is it fair for you to suggest higher tax rate for everyone? What about my freedom to decide what should I do with my own money?<p>Mind you, I am not suggesting that there should not be any taxes. Only thing I am suggesting is that government taxes & their role in our day to day life should be minimum.",1246816572

Is it % of internet traffic requests by browser? or % of downloads/installs?<p>I'm wondering if browser market share is based on users primary browser, using stats from companies like compete, or if it is based on downloads or some other metric.<p>I have IE, Safari And Opera only for testing purposes, I do most development in Firefox due to firebug, and use Chrome as my main browser. So how would I be counted in this survey?<p>I think this is important because if it is based on % of traffic, non-OEM browsers (Firefox, Chrome) could appear to have more traffic than default installed browsers (IE/Safari) simply because the users of Firefox & Chrome spend more time on more sites.<p>Thoughts?",1246816316

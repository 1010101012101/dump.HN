It's usually a minimum of hour door to door.  If you're working 10-12hr days, you'll pay for the easy subway commute.  However, there are plenty of very successful people that do commute from NJ, CT, and Westchester.<p>The solution to expensive Manhattan real estate is better mass transit. Imagine getting on a train 30 miles from the island and arriving at your office 30 minutes later. What kind or a miracle would this take?",1357711164

5030402,comment,5029825,5029825,1,0,SeoxyS,,,"I've been a Simple customer and have nothing but good things to report. As a bank, they provide pretty much all basic services, except for perhaps cash deposit (something I haven't needed to use in years). You can use any ATM out there. You'll probably get charged a fee by the ATM itself, but that's something I can live with. Most of the time, I try to get enough cashback when I get my groceries to cover my very minimal cash needs.<p>Where Simple really shines though is in two areas:<p>1) General non-sucky-ness. It's not a single feature, but rather the quality of the overall experience. The support features makes it really easy to write a textual query right in the regular dashboard or mobile app, and they usually reply within hours. There's no calling robotic phone lines and spending 30min in menus or on hold The website itself is beautiful and extremely usable. Unlike, say, Bank of America Online, the emotion you feel while navigating simple.com is delight, not frustration and exasperation.<p>2) Goals and Safe to Spend. When you open either the app or the website, there is a very visible balance amount. The trick is, it is not your actual account balance, but rather what Simple calls your Safe-to-Spend balance. Simple has a goals section, in which you can set up goals you wish to achieve by a certain date, as well as reserved funds (eg. an emergency fund). Simple takes all of that information into account, as well as recurring bills such as rent payments and subtracts it from the money it considers safe to spend.<p>It's great, it has really had a positive impact on my finances. I've never been good at budgeting, but through the way Simple handles Safe-to-Spend, it has kind of forced me into better consumption patterns.",1357710924

That is to say, a history told not from the perspective of popes and princes, but one based on material data about the world's great systems; macro-economic factors like weather patterns and the price of grain. This was supposed to be the vantage point from which the nefarious dynamic of capital would reveal itself most clearly, with the underlying data providing an empirical basis for Marx's economic theory, thereby grounding the whole enterprise in reality.<p>As it turned out, materialist history did provide a very revealing perspective, but not the one Braudel anticipated. Quite the opposite. Among its many revelations was the unavoidable fact that Marx's assertions about history simply weren't supported by the facts. Over time, Braudel found his reverence waning. Eventually, his loss of faith turned into outright rejection. That said, were it not for Marx, Braudel's absolutely brilliant history may never have been written. And that would be a shame, since the materialist approach that Braudel pioneered has become more relevant than ever in our own data-driven age.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Civilization-Capitalism-15th-18th-Century-Vol/dp/0520081145"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Civilization-Capitalism-15th-18th-Cent...</a>",1357709572

They treated us like dirt/crap. For example I had to call Seagate Software for Crystal Report issues and their tech support number was in Canada. Everything a law firm does is tagged to a client and matter number for accounting purposes. I used the office numbers because it was business related. Since it was in Canada there was no 1-800 or toll free number, so they took the cost of the calls (what they usually bill the clients for LD calls) out of my paycheck because it was Canada. I asked to be reimbursed because it is business related, and they refused, telling me not to call Canada anymore as they only want to deal with US based companies. Keep in mind that Crystal Reports was bundled with Visual Studio 5.0/6.0 back then and they paid for Crystal Reports 7.0 to give everyone that nifty Web based server that gave them RTF, Word, Excel, and PDF files on the fly. It had a lot of bugs, and you had to talk to Seagate (I think they changed names or got bought out since there, Business Objects, SaS, whatever) which was located in Canada. I got so upset that I bought a LD calling card to make those calls.<p>Moving from Windows 95 and Office 97 to Windows 2000 and Office 2000 was a nightmare, because there were bugs and I was told Microsoft was aware of it and will fix it in the next service pack. We had gone to the latest and greatest of Microsoft's software instead of waiting for service packs to be released to address bugs so it is more stable. My Fax program used a Word Object to copy RightFAX codes into a document and print with a RightFax printer driver to fax out documents. Problem was Word 2000 had a bug that messed up the toolbar after a document was closed using the Word object in Visual BASIC. Microsoft admitted the bug, but didn't release a service pack to fix it yet. Management didn't understand that and had me search MSDN for a solution or maybe a beta service pack to address the issue. Then I am chewed out for wasting five hours searching the MSDN knowledgebase for a solution. I forget how we fixed it, but the work-a-round from Microsoft was to minimum Word 2000 and then restore it and the toolbar bug went away after that. After the service packs were released the bug went away.<p>While working for that company I suffered a nervous breakdown from the abuse and stress, and ended up on short-term disability, when I returned I was fired two weeks later for having a panic attack at work.

Manually including files is not only error-prone, but is tedious and requires development effort [time] that would be best utilized elsewhere.<p>> [...] this particular approach ('autoload') costs too much and delivers too little to be generally praiseworthy<p>Costs too much? Have you not implemented it? It's not hard at all to implement, even if you have an unorthodox file & class naming convention. The only caveat is that you can only have 1 class per file (which hopefully you'd agree is good practice in the first place).<p>Performance increases can be pretty large, too, especially at scale. Consider class A, which in some methods requires access to class B. You _could_ put the include inside those methods, but I can guarantee you that you'll see a noticeable performance hit if that method is called in iteration (we're talking a few seconds worth of time if iterated 1000+ times). That's non-trivial. So, what do you do? You could move it to the top of the file, so that it will only be required once. However, the problem here is you end up with 5-10+ includes at the top of every file. So now when you require that one file, you're now requiring an additional 5-10+ files, each with their own possible set of includes. I've seen instances of needing to require a single file result in having 100+ files being required due to the cascading. With an autoloader, that 100+ goes back to 1.<p>> whilst harming simplcity<p>This couldn't be further from the truth. You will have less LoC overall, less developer time spent trying to get the perfect set of includes so that you only require them once and only when they're needed. You will have fewer bugs due to the problems with manual includes, which again, means more time for developers to actually do stuff that matters.",1357708823

Any time a framework get's complex this happens.<p>Look at big data and AI.  There are loads of permutations.  How do you prevent stuff from just happening?  How do you make sure that things are correct etc.?  Trust me I would love to do TDD on an AI / big data analysis project.  But the reality is that no-one has figured out how to reliably test things....so TDD is not the right tool at this point.  But there is also the potential to introduce vulnerabilities.  That doesn't mean I am not going to use AI or do big data.<p>It's always a balance between tighter security/less complexity,  or more complexity and less security etc...obviously there are other factors as well,  but my point is to choose the right tool for the job.....sometimes it is Rails,  and sometimes not......<p>And beyond that give the Rails team kudos for a taking care of things like this when they do find them.",1357708370

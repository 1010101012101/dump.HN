9370047,comment,9369577,9369577,0,0,pbnjay,,,"Perfect timing. I&#x27;m bootstrapping my own startup (<a href=""http://moonlighter.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://moonlighter.io</a>) at the moment and had a couple questions about the MVP.<p>1) How can you quickly validate a business with very little immediately visible value to the user? Direct user interviews won&#x27;t work here because the service is very data-driven (collecting filesystem events), so it&#x27;ll require a decent amount of data collection from the user (I&#x27;ll offer something like a 14-30 day trial to allow this). Since it has to be done over a longer period of time, and it includes collecting information that might be sensitive to some people, it&#x27;s not very easy to fully validate the business. I&#x27;ve had a few friends using it, and I&#x27;ll be sharing with a small beta user list soon, but otherwise I was wondering if you had any other ideas.<p>2) I&#x27;ve put off writing the payment processing code, focusing on the product itself. Especially considering the &quot;trial&quot; period necessary to see value, are there any downsides to releasing the MVP without allowing payments and then adding them in after release? (Other than no cashflow of course...)<p>Thanks! I&#x27;m actually reading through the lean startup now (after reading way too much of it&#x27;s principles on the internet first). So it&#x27;s neat to be able to communicate with the author directly like this.",1428955196

9370018,comment,9366906,9366906,0,0,bkeroack,,,"This is what happens when engineers subordinate themselves to non-technical management in a business-driven (as opposed to engineering-driven) organization.<p>The ironic/tragic thing is that the consultants who are brought in at much expense (and who therefore have some credibility with &quot;the business&quot;) are often no better than--usually worse than--the in-house engineers they are supposed to help. If you ever find yourself an engineer in a dynamic like this, you should interpret it as a sign of mistrust--even outright disrespect--of you and your peers by your bosses. Imagine if you were a physician and hospital management thought it necessary to bring in outside physicians to help you with your patients. Not many doctors I know would put up with that, but engineers are culturally so submissive that they go along with it and deal with the Dilbert scenario of the $500/hour consultant giving the same recommendations the in-house engineers have been saying all along (which the consultants get credit for, of course).<p>If you&#x27;re ever in a position of authority and feel that it&#x27;s necessary to bring in consultants to &quot;fix&quot; your codebase, it would be worthwhile to reflect for a few moments on how this situation came to be. Either you failed your organization on the hiring front and have terrible engineers (unlikely), or your otherwise talented engineers cannot do their jobs effectively due to the environment you&#x27;ve created. Perhaps you&#x27;ve forced them to incur so much technical debt by nonstop &quot;sprints&quot;, unrealistic deadlines and multiple pivots that any forward progress is all but impossible.

9369969,comment,9363053,9367439,0,0,ygra,,,"Floating figure placement has been possible for ages, but with the caveat that the figure has to be anchored to a particular paragraph and Word makes sure that the anchored paragraph and the figure appear on the same page, sometimes moving both the paragraph and the figure on the next page, e.g.<p><pre><code>    ...... ......
    ...... ......
    ...... ......
           ┌────┐
    <space>│    │
           └────┘
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s about the only annoyance. Not that LaTeX is without fault here either, oftentimes giving up on figure placement (even with »here«) and putting them at the end of the section.<p>Math typesetting has been possible since 2007 in an integrated form (whereas the old formula editor was just an embedded OLE object, which you couldn&#x27;t style, and which often didn&#x27;t match the surrounding text in size and font). The syntax is similar to LaTeX, although (in my opinion) easier and faster to type because of a few syntactic niceties (see UTN #28).<p>And if you wanted automatic ToC generation your option has always (back at least several versions and two or three decades) been to use the proper styles Heading 1–9. Generally, if you want to keep your sanity you should be using styles everywhere and always. I don&#x27;t use physical formatting at all. The benefits of that are the same as in LaTeX: You can change styles at will without going through all of your document and it&#x27;s far easier to achieve a consistent look of the document.<p>But yes, every now and then I see people who approach »I want to make this a heading« as »I need to make this bold and larger«. I&#x27;m not sure how they are thinking (especially since Word since 2007 made styles <i>much</i> more prominent than the physical formatting), but there are such people. LaTeX&#x27;s advantage here is that it needs education to use <i>at all</i>, which means that&#x27;s the point where one can basically say »There are no ways of making things bold, only ways of emphasising more, which <i>may</i> be rendered as bold«. Word can and will be used without training and the results are exactly what you&#x27;d expect in that case.",1428954579

I also bill regularly which means I don&#x27;t have a huge amount of accounts receivable at any given time. I do not believe in billing the entire amount after delivery.<p>These tactics don&#x27;t always work and things happen where I don&#x27;t get paid. Usually I speak to the client directly and ask them to just pay up, working with them on terms that will work for their situation. Most clients are super happy and relieved to get this type of help from me. This works about 80% of the time. It works 100% of the time when the client would like me to do work in the future.<p>If they don&#x27;t pay at that point I do two things. First, I don&#x27;t work with them any more, thus I stop my own financial bleeding. Second, I will start to make demands. Depending on how much I am demanding this could be a simple written letter saying &quot;Please pay before further legal steps must be taken.&quot; Generally almost all clients will pay at this point. If they don&#x27;t, at times, honestly, I just let it go and write it off as lost funds and move on.<p>I have, on two occasions, taken clients to court for the money.

Most agile systems are designed to insulate management from the volatility inherent in software development (and to tamp it down a little bit). They aren&#x27;t really designed to exploit the positive variability.<p>Here&#x27;s a classic example: let&#x27;s say I have a story card that says &quot;build a feature that lets 10000 customers buy a widget from our store.&quot; In most classic agile systems, the engineering team will do their best to understand the customer requirement and see that it&#x27;s built appropriately.<p>Now let&#x27;s say that 0 customers show and buy the widget. Who&#x27;s fault is this? In traditional agile, it&#x27;s the Product Owner&#x27;s fault, not the engineering team.<p>But exploiting positive variability would say: the effort required to build this feature requires knowing in advance how many customers want to buy the widget. The engineering effort is totally different if the answer is 0, 10, 100, 10000, or 1000000 customers. So rather than build the feature as specified, let&#x27;s do an experiment to try and assess customer demand first, then build in response to that demand.<p>That means that sometimes a story will take 10X longer than you originally planned and sometimes it will take 1/10th as long.

First of all, I&#x27;m not a fan of the &quot;10X engineer&quot; framing. I&#x27;m much more interested in the systems that companies can build to create 10X teams.<p>I am thinking of two conventional &quot;10X engineers&quot; right now that I&#x27;ve worked with in my career. One is extremely loud, brash, judgmental and basically scary. If you are brave enough to come to him with a question, and he thinks it&#x27;s stupid, you will basically never live it down. The second is extremely humble, quiet, and gentle. If you come to him with a question, he probably won&#x27;t answer it but will show up two days later with a fully-implemented solution that he created at 2am just to see if it was possible.<p>In most companies, the first 10X engineer tends to get promoted to a position of seniority, while the second is generally allowed to quietly leave the company when they get bored. And don&#x27;t even get me started on all the incredibly talented people out there who our biased hiring processes can&#x27;t ever identify as &quot;10X.&quot;<p>If you ever get the chance to mingle with some of the truly famous founders, ask yourself if they strike you as the smartest people you&#x27;ve ever met.

There&#x27;s a ring of truth to it, but it still falls flat.<p>Edit: a few things: arguments based on the behavior of &quot;the majority&quot; and arguments founded on the principle that 100% of all people who have ever been Game of Thrones viewers are completely and utterly committed to viewing every single season are rather weak. Viewership of shows changes from season to season. More so, not every TV show viewer is the sort of person who must start a series from the beginning. Pulling in folks who are caught up on Game of Thrones but haven&#x27;t been hooked on the current season and pulling in folks who will begin mid stream (and then maybe go back and watch from the beginning, or not) adds to their viewership. More viewers means more purchases, more purchases means more dollars.<p>Not to mention the value of retaining their existing viewership base.<p>These are all the same reasons why coke continues to dump massive amounts of dollars into advertising despite already being well known and having a huge chunk of the soft drink marketshare. In fact, the returns on investment for advertising already popular products tends to be higher than for products just entering the market, because the numbers are so big. There are millions of Game of Thrones fans. If even a few hundred thousand existing fans who might have held off on watching the new season are kept on the hook and if even a few hundred thousand non-watchers gain interest in the show via starting with the new season and if only a small fraction of those folks end up purchasing the discs, or HBO (in whatever form) then that&#x27;s a considerable amount of money in HBO&#x27;s pocket that would have been left on the table.<p>Which isn&#x27;t saying it wasn&#x27;t an accident, but business wise this is still a win for HBO.",1428953199

You might want to look at Jquery UI draggable elements <a href=""https://jqueryui.com/draggable/#scroll"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jqueryui.com/draggable/#scroll</a>. There is nothing technically challenging about this concept.<p>Secondly, your specification is too vague for anyone to actually build. Programming is an exact art since the computer is the most unforgiving thing to work with (computer = fast + stupid). I would suggest that you work with a UI/UX (user interface/ user experience) person to refine your specifications. It would be helpful if the UI/UX person has some experience with programming to validate your concept and turn the idea into build-able specs.<p>Usually programmers work with UI/UX designers (and sometimes visual designers and marketers) to vet out the concept before starting to work on the code. The reason for this is that coding is a big investment in time and just the slightest change can have profound effects on the underlying code because fairly simple things can turn out to be very complex when you factor in everything.<p>The  way that you have your description right now, most competent programmer would not be interested in this project because there seems to be a big gap between what you want and what you know from the technical perspective. My advice is to narrow this gap by enlisting the help of a UI/UX designer first.",1428952283

The statute applies to &quot;confidential communications&quot; -- i.e., <i>conversations in which one of the parties has an objectively reasonable expectation</i> that no one is listening in or overhearing the conversation. See Flanagan v. Flanagan, 41 P.3d 575, 576-77, 578-82 (Cal. 2002).

I&#x27;d say to you, it&#x27;s the same.<p>Now, in a two player tournament, yes, using a robot gives you an advantage because the opponent probably has less stamina than your robot.<p>But in a competition involving thousands of people, there&#x27;s really no advantage over any one person because the greatest force on any individual player is the sum of all other players against them, not one player with a robot. Do you think that sounds reasonable?<p>So the way I see it using a robot is really only a way to make things more comfortable for yourself, just like driving coast to coast is probably more comfortable and likely less time consuming than walking. It&#x27;s not unfair to walkers, you&#x27;re not stopping them from walking coast to coast. The only thing that might stop walkers is their stamina.<p>So while it&#x27;s true that the reddit case does exhibit scarcity and competition for that (there&#x27;s only so many click spots per reset), whether people are playing with robots or flesh doesn&#x27;t make any difference to you, because wherever you are, at whatever time, there&#x27;s always someone else there with you.

I think about this all the time, since I feel a responsibility to try and talk about lean startup in such a way that prevents misunderstanding.<p>I would say the two most fatal misapplications are:<p>1. &quot;up and to the right&quot; disease. here you split-test everything and just do whatever moves the numbers. pretty soon you are selling porn or psychic hotlines.<p>2. &quot;no vision, no problems&quot; error. It&#x27;s like trying to do science without a hypothesis. In lean startup we emphasize that people trying to predict the future are often wrong, so it&#x27;s best to experiment and pivot as you learn. But some people interpret this to mean that the future is unknowable, there&#x27;s no point in having any kind of vision, and you should just ship something and see what happens. the problem with this plan is you are guaranteed to succeed - at seeing what happens. after-the-fact rationalization will prevent any learning, because if you can&#x27;t fail you can&#x27;t learn. having a big expansive vision is really helpful because it provides lots of falsifiable hypotheses for testing.<p>3. &quot;minimum viable crap&quot; sloppy execution. Some people think MVP means just throw garbage at the wall and see what sticks, especially since the M makes people think lean startup is for doing something small. but the truth is if you&#x27;re doing something small, you don&#x27;t need MVP or lean startup. you only need an MVP if you&#x27;re trying something large. further, part of the MVP process is to learn what customers actually value in terms of quality, so we can build something that they perceive as excellent. shipping crap isn&#x27;t the goal, and people that go on TechCrunch with garbage and then claim &quot;but it&#x27;s an MVP!&quot; are doing it wrong. the hard truth is that spending more time &quot;perfecting&quot; a product in the absence of feedback often makes the product worse, not better.",1428951649

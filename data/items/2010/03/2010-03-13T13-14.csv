And when we speak of ""properly"" (or ""wisely""), naturally it is only meaningful given that we have the ability to make <i>choices</i>.  (c.f. ""to thine own self be true"")",1268488641

Obviously the uparrows aren't only for applauding politeness, so it seems reasonable that the downarrows aren't only for booing rudeness.<p>""It only becomes abuse when people resort to karma bombing: downvoting a lot of comments by one user without reading them in order to subtract maximum karma.

I don't expect everyone to agree with me, but I expect myself to analyze my own behavior to figure out what really contributes to the community. The site management, of course, has to figure out how to set up incentives for altruistic rather than mob behavior.<p>I always wonder, when I see a post about the evils of downvotes, why I don't see more replies about what is good to upvote.

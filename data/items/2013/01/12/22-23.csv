We ran away from people, and escaped into the wonderful world of computing because everything synchronizes, there is harmony and greatness in mathematics.  And when we deal with the slightest form of human offence, it's as if the other person is our own mind, telling us that we are a burden to society, and it is our time to be killed, as simply as the body tells cells out-of-place to die.<p>Programmers need to disconnect and not let the external environment become part of us.  Sometimes I let other people's minds become part of my mind.  I think it's a profound glimpse into how programmers can use our motor neurons to actually ""be"" a compiler in software, and to anticipate how it works.<p>Unconsciously we do the same things with other humans, and there are ways that humans can take over that process and their disapproval of us is like our own mind finding disapproval for a system inside it that must be destroyed.  With the proper scenarios, make programmers suicidal, when they can utter the proper dark magic incantation, we do a cost benefit analysis and decide that suicide does remove the defective systems.  rm -rf /<p>I think the takeaway here is that some of the best programmers tend to have serious problems separating the directives of self from the directives of others.

Eventually you'll learn that for many of the toughest problems in life, no clever algebraic trick exists to sort it all out, and you either learn something or you go down the rabbit hole. My first rabbit hole was mortality (I lost sleep for months trying to reason my way around mortality), and my second was simple financial transactions. Relationships, kids, politics, justice -- anything involving other people -- tend to be intractable problems.<p>One of my ""great insights"" was figuring out that I didn't understand how I made decisions -- that when I consciously made a decision wasn't when I decided but more like when I became aware that some kind of unconscious tipping point had already been reached. When I have mentioned this to other people I have <i>never</i> ended up in an argument -- they either nod at me as though it's about time I figured this out, or they stop and think about it and agree.<p>This insight is almost a cliche in matters such as romance, but really it applies to almost everything. When you realize how little we know about our own consciousness, how our rational minds are constantly fooled into thinking they're in charge, the idea we can truly just reason our way out of every kind of problem quickly becomes laughable.<p>I'm very sad that such a brilliant guy killed himself, but looking at all his blog posts with dewy eyed admiration is morbid, silly, and perhaps even dangerous.

I know of A) therapy and B) medication.<p>I've spoken to 5 therapist for a couple sessions each, and my impression was that they are just normal people who you can talk to.  They're not people who have answers, nor do they conduct their sessions with an overarching strategic plan.  Rather, they're just people who you can talk to, and they will try their best to listen, even if they don't necessarily understand what you say. I know a lot of people benefit from this, but when I tried option A I didn't get anything out of it.<p>In my case, my mental suffering derives from loneliness. I follow John Cacioppo's work on the subject, and he claims that loneliness is a biological signal (just like hunger) that requires a response. I believe in his explanation, and so to me applying medication to ease loneliness would be similar to giving someone a pill to end their feeling of being hungry.  To me that's not really a solution: in the case of hunger, food is the solution, and in the case of loneliness, connection is the solution.<p>Neither forms of help seem to me like they will help in my particular case.

The Open Access Movement has fought valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it. But even under the best scenarios, their work will only apply to things published in the future. Everything up until now will have been lost.<p>That is too high a price to pay. Forcing academics to pay money to read the work of their colleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only allowing the folks at Google to read them? Providing scientific articles to those at elite universities in the First World, but not to children in the Global South? Its outrageous and unacceptable.<p>I agree, many say, but what can we do? The companies hold the copyrights, they make enormous amounts of money by charging for access, and its perfectly legal  theres nothing we can do to stop them. But there is something we can, something thats already being done: we can fight back.<p>Those with access to these resources  students, librarians, scientists  you have been given a privilege. You get to feed at this banquet of knowledge while the rest of the world is locked out. But you need not  indeed, morally, you cannot  keep this privilege for yourselves. You have a duty to share it with the world. And you have: trading passwords with colleagues, filling download requests for friends.<p>Meanwhile, those who have been locked out are not standing idly by. You have been sneaking through holes and climbing over fences, liberating the information locked up by the publishers and sharing them with your friends.<p>But all of this action goes on in the dark, hidden underground. Its called stealing or piracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the moral equivalent of plundering a ship and murdering its crew. But sharing isnt immoral  its a moral imperative. Only those blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy.<p>Large corporations, of course, are blinded by greed. The laws under which they operate require it  their shareholders would revolt at anything less. And the politicians they have bought off back them, passing laws giving them the exclusive power to decide who can make copies.<p>There is no justice in following unjust laws. Its time to come into the light and, in the grand tradition of civil disobedience, declare our opposition to this private theft of public culture.<p>We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with the world. We need to take stuff that's out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open Access.<p>With enough of us, around the world, well not just send a strong message opposing the privatization of knowledge  well make it a thing of the past. Will you join us?<p>Aaron Swartz\nJuly 2008, Eremo, Italy",1358028435

I once imagined it that way too.  The very first thing a law student is taught is that everything is a grey area: laws are left vague deliberately in order to be interpreted by judges; evidence and procedure are negotiable; everything is subjective.  The legal framework is only that, a framework.  The legal machine is far, far from deterministic. It is designed from the top down to be discretionary.<p>Otherwise you'd more often run into situations where you couldn't prosecute someone because a statute didn't spell out their exact actions even though in spirit they had violated it.",1358028374

5049074,comment,5048301,5048783,5,0,maratd,,,"> If someone is formally charged with a federal felony, that means they have been indicted by a federal Grand Jury; i.e., a majority of the 23 Grand Jurors felt that there is probable cause for charging the defendant(s) with the alleged offense(s). People indicted by Grand Juries should end up getting convicted the vast majority of time<p>This is profoundly ignorant. As a Grand Juror, you will have a mountain of documents dumped on you, alleging or suggesting various crimes. The validity, accuracy, or even meaning of those documents, isn't debated or even examined.<p>A Grand Jury will indict anyone where the law enforcement officers have done a minimal amount of investigation and have gathered something. The process is there to prevent <i>mass prosecution</i>, in other words, to make sure the government does some minimal amount of work at least.<p>It does not, in any way, suggest guilt of any sort.<p>They could present a Grand Jury with documents from another case and not a single Grand Juror would be the wiser. Obviously that would be illegal and grossly inappropriate, but the fact that this could easily be done suggests that the process isn't there to determine any realistic ""probable cause"" ... just to make sure a minimal amount of work was completed.",1358028271

Dividends usually indicate one of two things - 1) the company is healthy and profitable 2) the company has a massive cash pile.<p>In the case of Microsoft it was both, but primarily the mountain of cash they used to have (>$60bn) that got investors complaining that MS do something with the cash mountain.  MS would easily have more cash than Apple if they didn't put in the effort to get rid of it over the past 5 years or so.",1225118511

If the Apple TV was a bit more powerful and allowed for watching/recording of TV then it would be a winner.  I use mine with a projector and love it.

I can't justify canceling cable until they offer live-tv for things like the news, and sports.<p>I'm ok with paying for TV shows ala-cart with no monthly subscription.  With how little I watch it would probably be cheaper anyway.  The only reason we have cable is for football and a handful tv series.",1225117435

345135,comment,344801,344801,0,0,gregfjohnson,,,"I'm a bit of a lurker on HN, but had to add a comment here.  The Stanford online offerings are fantastic.  I'm taking Stephen Boyd's ""Introduction to Linear Dynamic Systems"", and it is simply superb.  The course is given at a rate of two lectures per week, but I've found that it fits into the rest of my life more conveniently to watch and absorb one lecture per week.  Monday evenings are now my official ""learn some new and important stuff"" nights.<p>""Linear dynamic systems"" is the essential intellectual foundation of a scary number of different areas:  control systems, modern financial modeling, statistical modeling and analysis, search, etc.  The material is a bit difficult, but it's one of those areas that are widely applicable.<p>I firmly believe that this whole area should be part of the core curriculum of any computer science program.  It is right where more and more of the discipline is heading.<p>I've wanted to learn this stuff for a while, and have banged my head against a few books in the area, tried to take a UCLA extension course, etc.  But never have I encountered more clear, intuitive, and lucid explanations of this material than in Prof. Boyd's online lectures.<p>This is one of those resources that make you wonder, ""Why would an organization like Stanford but this on the web and give it away for free??""  But if they are going to do it, then smart people sure as hell should take advantage of it.",1225116750

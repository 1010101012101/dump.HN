Whether these generalize to <i>every</i> spouse having the same powers and requirements as a single spouse does now, or whether those powers require a <i>majority</i> of the members of the multiparty relationship, or some other rule in a multiparty case probably needs separate analysis for each of the areas.",1445446792

It&#x27;s 2015 the largest consumer HDDs you can get from WD, Seagate, and HGST are 6TB, 8TB, and 10GB respectively. That&#x27;s 3-5x growth for the 5 year period.  Why has growth slowed?  Is it a technological constraint or a lack of investment?<p>In the early 2000s you could only play music and movies you possessed so there was a big demand for storage space for all your ripped CDs and DVDs.  In 2007 Netflix introduced online streaming and today we have thousands of choices for streaming video or music on demand which combined with cloud storage options negated our need for high capacity drives.  I think the fact that people are opting for 120GB SSDs over 4TB HDDs demonstrates that the consumer need for extremely large hard drives is in decline.<p>In the past the HDD makers were very competitive but if you look at WD, Seagate and HGST today you can see they&#x27;re no longer competing on drive capacities.  HGST is the only one that even bothers to sell a consumer grade 10TB HDD.  Western Digital has been diversifying for years; first it was portable backup solutions, then NAS drives, NAS solutions, Surveillance and Data Center drives, and just today they announced they&#x27;re buying Sandisk, a major SSD player.<p>I think the industry as a whole is moving away from HDDs and for that reason they nolonger need to compete so ferociously on price points.",1445446709

The stream and most of the heavy other assets comes directly from Netflix. It is WAY better and safer than VPNs and “smart DNS” services (both potentially routing and/or intercepting every requests your computer makes at any time).<p>There is a live chat inside the app for feedback or support, if you have any questions or suggestions we can talk there.<p>By the way, all the Back to the Future movies are available right now. That’s what I will be watching tonight!<p>(PS: Windows version is coming soon)\n(PS 2: It is completely free for now, until you guys and I are satisfied with the quality of the app)",1445446693

10426701,comment,10425167,10425628,0,0,bpatrianakos,,,"I disagree. I can relate to application setup and deployment <i>feeling</i> like its a fragile, error prone process but library usage in general is a good thing. Now if you&#x27;re picking up obscure, poorly maintained libraries from GitHub I can see that going south quickly but as long as you&#x27;re smart about not only which dependencies to choose from whom but also knowing when you really need them then you end up with a robust, easy to maintain system in the end.<p>The whole point of having a dependency chain is to benefit from well tested code that often does mundane things that you neither have the time or expertise to create yourself. I&#x27;ve found that as long as I choose libraries that are up to date, look to be maintained, are decently tested, and do something that I couldn&#x27;t do as well or don&#x27;t have the time to implement as well then all is well. I also have a rule that if a dependency is at all mission critical or not easily replaced I will either fork that library and maintain my own copy or create one for myself.<p>This has been true for every language I&#x27;ve worked with. Go, PHP, Node, or Ruby so far.<p>Updating might be cumbersome but if you&#x27;re following best practices then you&#x27;ve got tests that ensure updating a library won&#x27;t break your code. You also don&#x27;t go around mass updating things. You update when there&#x27;s a good reason to (security patches, language compatibility, etc.). Deployment should only suck the first time. Nowadays we have tools to ensure systems are replicable so you can be confident code will run fine regardless of the environment.<p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll ever have a plug and play experience. We have so many hobbyist libraries precisely because our languages and tools are so flexible. Hiding complexity is what programmers do for users. To hide from developers too would likely do more harm than good and result in a generation of programmers who don&#x27;t understand how their systems really work. I point to Rails and Meteor as examples. There are Rails developers who are a thing in and of themselves. They&#x27;re not Ruby devs who know Rails, they&#x27;re just Rails developers. There needs to be the person like the Rails core team who know how to put dependencies together in a way that creates a functional modular system.",1445446545

Do they make their home-grown code into a module for reuse, or just copy/paste? Say they copy/paste and then they find a bug in their implementation years down the line (or worst, someone else does, as this author has moved on to greener pastures).<p>Uh-oh - same problem as relying on a module, but now it&#x27;s more work to fix (the code is everywhere and perhaps has evolved now independently), and there wasn&#x27;t the framework of module authors, testing infrastructure, bug tracking system, peer review, etc, etc, etc there to have a drop in replacement for ya.<p>The line to draw for reusable code is certainly yours to make. My line not to cross is when I&#x27;m practicing, &quot;Copy and Paste Programming&quot; - easy enough to take the extra 5 minutes and package the code up for reuse. Makes it easier to make my unit tests up and all the rest of the good practices of a Perl programmer.",1445446390

Don&#x27;t jump straight into React Router, as you&#x27;d be missing a chance to learn about, for example, state (to control the current page), conditional rendering (to display whatever should be the current page component based on state) and component lifecycle hooks (to register a basic hashchange event handler to implement your own simple back/forward support). Don&#x27;t jump straight into Redux, Flux or a cursor implementation, as you won&#x27;t get a chance to experience the problems they solve first-hand.

In Alex Schultz’s Startup Class lecture he discloses that, for Facebook, someone that has 15 friends is likely to remain active on the service for a long time, so their retention strategies are all focused around promoting the behavior of adding friends.<p>To find your own core retention behavior, look for specific actions that are common to your ideal users, then promote that behavior in your retention strategies.</i><p>I&#x27;m not a marketing expert, but this seems like a classic example of &quot;confusing causation and correlation&quot; to me. So, in the example above, facebook has found that &quot;user has > 15 friends&quot; is a good indicator for &quot;user is loyal&quot;. Fair enough. but instead of going &quot;we have this awesome way of identifying loyal users, now let&#x27;s find out what made them loyal in the first place&quot;, the guide assumes that the high friend count actually <i>causes</i> the loyality and advises to do everything to bump it up.<p>In Facebook&#x27;s case, this probably works, because friend count might actually influence retention in some ways. (e.g., your news feed might become more active or more interesting, making you want to stay). But even then, you&#x27;re kept completely in the dark what made those people sign up and add friends in the first place.<p>i think taking this as a general advice might actually be dangerous. In the best case, you keep a high retention rate but have no idea why; In the worst case, it might tempt you to build &quot;features&quot; that try to manipulate or even force the users into particular behaviors, only to inflate some metric.

Do you think financial applications are more important in the hardware and software markets than simulations? (&quot;Simulations&quot;, btw, includes all video games.)<p>I&#x27;d like to give your suggestion the benefit of the doubt, that the &quot;only&quot; place floating point is necessary is in simulations and that GPUs could handle all floating point needs, but my gut reaction is that this is wildly out of touch with how often programs use floats. I might be wrong here, that&#x27;s just my first thought.<p>IIRC, GPUs across different devices often don&#x27;t guarantee the level of precision you might need. Not to mention, getting data in and out, and using non built-in math functions, are both a pain.<p>Depending on what kind of display or device or medium you&#x27;re using, 2D layouts using floating point routinely. Most mobile devices now come in non 1:1 device pixel ratio. You have to use floating point to get pixel accurate layouts. Almost all vector art (SVG, PDF, etc) and almost all animation (CSS, Movie editing) use floating point heavily.<p>&quot;Data processing&quot; - I dunno what that means, but a lot of the &quot;data processing&quot; I&#x27;ve done used floats or doubles or higher. Anything with computer vision in it will often use floating point; think about the rise of fingerprint and facial recognition.<p>A long time ago, desktop CPUs used to come without floating point support, and everyone wanted it and paid for it, so now we have it. Granted that was before GPUs, but I&#x27;m curious if Intel would even entertain the idea of a general purpose desktop CPU without floating point support.",1445443574

Code for the project here: <a href=""https://github.com/scotts/cellgen/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/scotts/cellgen/</a><p>Cell made a big splash in the high-performance computing community because it gave software the kind of fine-grained control that people with a detailed knowledge of processor architecture and their own algorithms could exploit. But the difficulty with how that kind of control was exposed meant that it was kind of all or nothing: you either optimized your code to use the SPEs correctly and efficiently, or you didn&#x27;t use the SPEs at all.<p>I had the opportunity to talk with one of the main processor architects a while back, and I asked why they did not include any hardware-level caching for the SPEs at all - which I think would have allowed people to get that kind of incremental performance improvement. His answer was that they wanted all of the chips real estate and transistors towards the fine-grained control approach. Fair enough, but I think it would have been a lot more usable otherwise.<p>I think that Roadrunner (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Roadrunner"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Roadrunner</a>) was the only major deployment of the Cell processor, outside of the PlayStation 3.

Odd that I can clearly remember the debate and mis-remember the final outcome. Bill Joy was pretty adamant about &quot;fixing&quot; the various sizes of integers problem that C had been going through on x86 with the whole sizeof(int) != sizeof(ptr) code and we benchmarked it and it did not affect performance hardly at all.

This one part stuck out to me:<p>> Youssef was dangerous, Callie stressed, and though Molly believed her—and the doctor determined that her head injury had not affected her recall—Ed and Sabi were skeptical. When Molly relayed the story to them in the ER waiting room, the two exchanged glances. It wasn’t possible. Callie had to be confused.<p>> ...<p>> Half an hour later, unable to fall asleep, Sabi heard the stairs creak, then a knock on her door. It was Youssef. He looked devastated. “My mother is dead,” he told her. “I’ve got to fly to Denmark.”<p>> Sabi stared, jangly with exhaustion and now fright. “Okay,” she said. A couple of hours later, Ed helped Youssef load his bags into a cab.<p>I don&#x27;t quite know what to say about people like Sabi and Ed. I am reminded of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Eichmanns"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Eichmanns</a>, but maybe this, admittedly overused quote, sums up my feelings better:<p>> In the End, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends. -MLK<p>What poor human beings those two are.<p>Finally, Spoiler Alert!<p>> Then, just before the guards ushered him out, Youssef had twisted around, looked at her with his luminous brown eyes, and winked.<p>The mark of a monster. The article describes psychopathy in clinical terms but, especially in this case, I don&#x27;t believe we should sophisticate evil. Yes, the concept of evil differs from time to time, culture to culture, but it seems too easy to make excuses for the depraved rather than to commit to decisive action to stop them.",1452401886

Regular SRAM was volatile: it would be guaranteed to survive the CPU reboot instruction, but wouldn&#x27;t survive poweroffs. Only some consoles had it; these were usually the same ones with a really slow bus speed for the battery-backed SRAM. (And other consoles, like the C64, actually <i>didn&#x27;t clear main memory</i> on CPU reboot; on these consoles, you&#x27;d instead manually cycle through clearing everything <i>except</i> what you wanted to keep, and <i>then</i> reboot.)<p>In later consoles that had their own MMUs, like the PSX, this wasn&#x27;t a full hardware feature anymore, but rather a simulated convention. You&#x27;d &quot;reboot&quot; by dropping all your virtual-memory mappings except one, then asking the disk to async-fill some buffers from the binary you wanted to launch and then mapping those pages and jumping into them on completion. (Basically like unloading one DLL and then loading a different one, except you&#x27;re also forcefully dropping all the heap allocations the old DLL made when you unload it.)<p>In both the hard and soft implementations, the &quot;volatile SRAM&quot; page could be thought of as basically a writeback cache for the state in the actual battery-backed SRAM. You wouldn&#x27;t want to do individual byte-level writes to SRAM (writes to SRAM were <i>slowwww</i>), so when the game booted, you&#x27;d mirror SRAM to your state-page, and then update the state-page whenever you had something you wanted to persist—finally dumping it out to battery-backed SRAM when the player hit &quot;Save&quot;. Basically, most games were &quot;auto-saving&quot; from the beginning—but they were auto-saving to volatile memory.<p>But even games that had true &quot;auto-saving&quot;, like Yoshi&#x27;s Island, still kept an &quot;SRAM buffer&quot; like this; the write-to-SRAM event was just managed as a sequence of smaller bursts of memory-mapped IO done by modules that sat there playing music+animations and not doing any logic, like YI&#x27;s &quot;field/title card&quot; submodule when re-entered from a loss-of-life event, or its &quot;field/score card&quot; submodule entered by completing a stage. If there is ever what seems to be a &quot;pointlessly long&quot; animation in an auto-saving game of that era near a state-transition, it&#x27;s probably by design, to cover for an SRAM cache-flush. (The fact that flashy &quot;rewarding&quot; animations turned out to also be good game design, favored by slot-machine and casual-game designers the world over, is <i>mostly</i> coincidence.)<p>---<p>ETA: when you had neither kind of SRAM, but still wanted to preserve some state across a reboot, what could you do? Well, write it to video memory, of course!<p>On a system with a PPU, the PPU owned the VRAM; it wasn&#x27;t the CPU&#x27;s job to reset it, but rather the PPU&#x27;s. On a system with only a framebuffer, <i>nothing</i> owned the framebuffer (or rather, the framebuffer was an inherited abstraction from the character buffers of teletypes: the &quot;client&quot; owned the framebuffer, so it was up to the &quot;client&quot; to erase it. Restarting a mainframe shouldn&#x27;t forcibly clear all its connected teletypes; disconnecting from an SSH session shouldn&#x27;t forcibly clear your terminal, but rather <i>optionally</i> clear your terminal as a way your TTY driver is set to respond to the signal; etc.)<p>Either way, if you could get your data into VRAM generally or the framebuffer specifically, you could very likely read it back after reboot.<p>VRAM is also where many &quot;online&quot; development suites—the BASICs and Pascals of the time—expected you to write exception traces. Rather than trying to &quot;break into&quot; a debugger (i.e. cram a debugger into the same address space as your software), you&#x27;d simply have your trap-handler persist the stack-trace to VRAM, switch your tape drive over to the devtools disk, and reboot. The &quot;monitor&quot; would load, notice that there&#x27;s a stack-trace in VRAM, parse it, read the pages it mentions from your program (now on the slave tape) and display them.",1452399528

I&#x27;ve used multiple books both in self-study and class and this book is, to me, in a league of its own. Not only does <i>Algebra</i> teach modern algebra, it teaches one to think like a modern algebraist, and not like just any modern algebraist, but like Saunders Mac Lane who was pretty great at algebra.<p>As an example of <i>Algebra</i>&#x27;s approach, take the isomorphism theorems [1]. Now many undergraduate textbooks (like Dummit and Foote) will prove these theorems by manipulating cosets and deal with gross &quot;implementation details&quot; at the level of sets. Mac Lane insists otherwise: The only time you have to manipulate cosets is in order to construct the quotient G/N of a group G by one of its normal subgroups N. Once you have constructed this group and proved its <i>universal property</i>, the isomorphism theorems can be proved without ever mentioning cosets again. What is that universal property? It has two parts: First is that there is a morphism p from G to G/N which sends all of N to the identity in G/N. Second is that <i>any</i> morphism f from G to <i>any</i> group L that sends all of N to the identity in L necessarily factors <i>uniquely up to isomorphism</i> as a composition of morphisms g ∘ p. This is the essence of a quotient group.<p>Mac Lane&#x27;s approach is to apprehend the essence of what is studied while discarding as much of the set theoretic husk as is possible. It is algebra in its purest form, accessible to and transformative of the mind of an undergraduate. Reading this book is a recurring joy to me.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism_theorem</a>",1452398946

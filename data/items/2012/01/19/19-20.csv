Once I find that someone is thoughtful, reflective, or whatever you want to call it, I like to talk with them in a manner that prods the abstract. It now makes sense to me that my most successful collaborations have happened with people with whom I can easily speak in the abstract. Details and competence are real things, but they are not the most important things by a long shot. Details can't be accounted for except for the fact that they will arise and they will have to be dealt with in one manner or another. Also, besides a reticence to talk in the abstract, one thing that puts serious doubt in my mind about people is self-help books.",1327003195

One of the better things about Google is that with <i>most</i> engineers, you can raise some concern or some alternative way of doing things, and they'll just get it, understand all the implications, and be able to implement it with no further direction.  (The ones that can't are pretty infuriating to work with, because it takes you longer to hand-hold than it would to just do it yourself.)  I had an intern last fall where I could just give him the name of a product or technology to look into, or a contact e-mail for the team in charge, and he'd go look into it and come up with a working implementation.  He's just been given an offer, so with any luck he'll be a coworker next year.<p>The thing is - I'm not certain this is entirely a property of the person involved.  Yes, there are certain skills that make it easier to find information on your own.  But this is also a function of the problem domain and how well you know it.  If you give me a credit card and a problem statement, chances are that I can come up with a working webapp that solves the problem.  But if you give me the name of a VC and tell me to go raise money - where do I start?  How do I approach him?  What will burn bridges and what won't?<p>So my question to PG and any other resourceful folks out there is: how do you approach a problem domain in which you know <i>nothing</i>, and manage to gain enough of a map of the territory so that you listen to someone's one-word suggestions and instantly grasp the implications?",1327002848

These books are just as beat up as you'd expect, but the funds simply don't exist to replace them.<p>If you calculate ~25 years for a physical textbook, it doesn't look anywhere near as appealing to use an iPad.

What advice would give if one of your groups said that?  Paul everything I have studied about you and YC over the last 5 years tells me your an incredible person but you are stubborn and you know it.  You love experiments, the next office hours simply try this approach with one of the groups.  Ask them questions and then just sit back and listen.  I know it is hard because you are an excitable guy but try it.  They look at you as an authority figure, this larger than life person who just made there dreams come true.  That holds so much power, I wonder if you realize it?  Ease that stress by leveling the playing field.  One or two meetings like this, where they feel you are actually listening, and they will be right back to your level and its business as usual.  I bet you dinner at your favorite spot that if you truly give this a chance, it will work.<p>I understand the difference and don't pretend to know the daily goings on at YC, am just putting an alternate perspective on the table for consideration.  Tonight when you reflect on this conversation, I think an idea will come to you.  I am sure this is something that bothers you very much, because you are obsessed with solving tough problems.  I think people also forget that you are human and have feelings and your not always on the top of your game.  When people are overcome with a tough process they shut off.  As you stated, that doesn't mean they don't know how or that they are not capable.  They just don't know how to get back on the right track.  These situations don't need force they need delicate leadership.  If they don't respond from there, then you have done all you can and that is all anyone could ask for.<p>I even up voted you because I know you have taken time to have this conversation.  I most likely will never get into YC because I am a single founder, therefore I fear no recourse.  When the terms are level, inspiring conversation and progress can be made.

I was really just playing for the $100 but after speaking with him I felt like I should inquire about job opportunities. This is pretty much the opposite of what happened after my only other programming challenge experience.<p>I don't know if people saw this or not but a while back Instagram had a programming challenge inspired by the Darpa Shredder Challenge. They were offering a t-shirt for correct solutions and promised explicitly that every solution would get a personal response. They got more entries than they were expecting and didn't give t-shirts to everyone (which is somewhat understandable). What is much worse is that they didn't even bother to respond to correct solutions. I spent over an hour on it (including the bonus part) and they couldn't even send me a copy and pasted letter of something like ""Thanks for playing! We got more attention than we expected and won't be able to give you a t-shirt but we do appreciate you playing."" I would never consider working for a company that would respond to an unexpected number of solicited entries by simply ignoring them. I doubt that I'm the only person who was permanently turned off about Instagram by having my email and solution simply deleted without being looked at or responded to.",1327002346

There are a fixed number of seats, but you collect together by party. So if you formed a new party (say the Hacker news party), people all over the US could vote Hacker News.

So your rep would then be the Hacker News rep. Problems with this system involve fragmentation (you end up with dozens of parties and nothing gets done). Imagine instead of one Ron Paul voting no on every issue, every congressman votes no on every issue because they are all so fragmented. You need a civilized bunch of people who actually believe in consensus and giving ground to get things done (good luck with that).<p>Look, we all know the US electoral system is broken.

I know you have an incredible amount of knowledge but how you impress that information on people is very crucial.  I wonder if the process of sharing your knowledge with people needs some refining.<p>Watching you do office hours and other interactions, you often make the situation uncomfortable to people who are already unsure of whats next.  When you ask them a question, you cut them off as they are trying to explain what they see, only to try and answer the question for them.  This has been feedback from many who have experienced the YC process.<p>There are people like me who have built a company and held true to our vision.  We make money and we know how to run our business.  We have applied to incubators not to have someone tell us what to do, rather to get advice from people who have experience similar challenges and the apply them to our structure.  Granted there are groups coming through YC that don't have that experience and those people need some direction.  But for both sets of groups, they want you to actually listen to them.  When you bring them in for their hour each week, listen to them.  The wall is not that they cannot communicate or motivated to take down leads.  They are put out because every time they try to communicate they feel the door is slammed in their face as if their thought or idea doesn't matter.<p>In a recent blog post I wrote ""When people feel comfortable, essential and free to be individually themselves, a person can become a solar flare of focused energy that fuels the world we call business.""  So make them feel like they are not only essential to their company but that you actually care enough to listen and hear them.  People going on rants are an altogether different issue, but sometimes people need to just talk out loud to work their head around an idea.  As a matter of fact, you are one of those people!  But you have to give people the sense that their voice is relevant in the direction they are taking and not driven.  Give people time to understand why your suggestions should be heavily considered, so they can figure it out for themselves.<p>Again, this is from the outside but maybe it is a place to start.",1327001819

If you want to reset a branch to a certain commit, git allows you to do it, and because the data model is not hidden git can simply expose the needed operation (reset branch pointer) as is.<p>For the most part, git has neat porcelains for most operations nowadays, but the UI is sometimes a bit weird because it started off as nothing more than a set of tools to manipulate a DAG of content on disk.

Its the same iTunes account running on two devices now...). And once on my Linux box when I wanted the linux version.<p>Does this count as piracy? Probably.

Apparently, despite being Unlimited, if you get the ISO off the pirate bay for the unlimited version, it doesn't work unless you have the academic version of the ISO. I have no idea how to get the academic version of the ISO, because the ISO downloader on MSDN academic is a Windows-only program. (At the time I had no Windows computers --- I was trying to get my first Windows 7 install up!). SO I got the same ISO from the pirate bay (the only place to get hassle-free ISOs). It's important to note that I have Unlimited-edition licenses. It's not failing because I paid for Home-premium and am trying to run Unlimited. This is different versions of Unlimited. It makes my ears bleed just how many different incompatible versions there are.<p>It's just a confusing mess. I'm sure I count under the piracy statistics as a pirate user.

Interactive features can be a movie, HTML(5), 3D, or, yes, a Keynote presentation. Imagine a richer image gallery type experience, but with text, transitions, effects, etc. All this can be done w/ Keynote (and a little bit of visual design know-how) right now.<p>4. Not basic Keynote-style interactive stuff like I described above. You need to be able to produce and edit movies to add a movie. You need to be able to use 3-D software to make a 3-D model.

K-12 and Undergrad textbooks never really involve that much long-format reading. Plus Apple is trying to really show that there are alternative ways to learn besides reading.

He even experimented with designing entirely new alphabets that were phonetically based.<p>Jan Tschichold was another Bauhaus guy experimenting in the same realm. From Wikipedia: ""Between 1926 and 1929, he designed a universal alphabet to clean up the few multigraphs and non-phonetic spellings in the German language. ... The alphabet was presented in one typeface, which was sans-serif and without capital letters.""<p>It's interesting that it was born out of choices made to German, where they have many more capital letters in each sentence than we do in English. Regardless, it's clearly a stylistic choice, and one that the OP might even have to work harder to maintain, if he is accustomed to writing in sentence case.<p>There's that old saying that you must first learn the rules and then you can break them. That is exactly what is going on here, and the OP isn't unique in this. Throughout my time at design school many of my teachers, who had been educated by Bauhaus instructors, would email in only lowercasethey adopted the style.

When they do I suspect a lot of them will donate the fire to their local school.<p>That's why schools have to be cross platform.  Because you never know what is going to come in the door as a donation.

You can either think of your representative as functioning as your agent in all matters--that is, someone to parrot your views on everything and, inasmuch as your representative votes differently than you do, that is bad; or you can think your representative as your trustee--that is, someone who you empower with the ability to make decisions on your behalf, but you may not care about, or be aware of, many issues that the representative makes decisions on. If you favor the agentic model, you probably care more about your individual desires and goals being met, whereas in the trustee model, you probably care more about the ""greater good"" or ""national interest"" and so on being met, and so care less if your individual preferences are supplanted for the greater good.<p>If you adopt a trusteeship model, you would argue that your elected representative can (and actually, should) make decisions based on what he or she thinks is best for the world/community as a whole, including decisions about the internet. That person would not be beholden to any ""special interests"" (as in, whatever people in the constituency might care about like roads or etc.) but would be beholden to whatever he or she thought most important--so, presuming you elected someone with whom you agreed generally, and who implicitly adopted this way of thinking about their role in government, you would probably be ""fairly"" represented. If you adopt an agentic model, then likely the interests that are most important to the majority of people who elected that official will get priority. Since you may have nothing in common with those people except that you live in the same area, you would probably argue that youre not being fairly represented, since those people likely do not represent your views.",1327000282

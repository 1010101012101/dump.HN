However, I think it&#x27;s interesting that the article doesn&#x27;t really mention cynical &quot;good&quot; students when I think I know more cynical &quot;good&quot; students than cynical bad students or plain &quot;good&quot; students. In particular, several of my friends are international students who pay essentially 4x the tuition I pay. That gives them an extreme incentive to go through college as efficiently as possible. This usually means attending a minimal amount of lectures, self-studying, and only showing up to turn in homework and take exams.<p>At a public school, especially in an engineering department, there often isn&#x27;t much a difference between professor and a talking head reading off information from a student&#x27;s perspective. In fact, one of the things that motivated cynical students quickly realize is that not only is self-study often more efficient than than the traditional go to lecture and take notes approach--it&#x27;s often a far superior way to learn and you can easily find yourself outperforming students who diligently go to class.

And I agree with almost everything about it, except this line:<p><pre><code>    Success as a faculty member requires one thing above all else: a good reputation in your field.\n</code></pre>\nAnd all I really disagree with is the wording - a good reputation <i>does not mean a reputation for excellence.</i> A good reputation means agreeable, means suitably deferential, means knows the correct people and will do as they&#x27;re told. None of this correlates with excellence...and people who are excellent at research probably don&#x27;t really want to become faculty, aside from the status and security - it takes away the ability to do research, for a large part.<p>So I agree with the conclusion that the overall standard of faculty is not impressive to students, but it&#x27;s not because the faculty are not risk takers or innovative - it&#x27;s because for the most part, the faculty are political animals, not technical ones. They may also be very good technically, but this is an accident and not a feature of the system and untrue more often as not. The cynical students mentioned in the article will likely sniff that out quite quickly whereas, in my experience, the good students are simply more naive. Both types tend to be just as intelligent and hard working, but the cynical students will work on what they want, rather than what the professor wants.",1382775972

In complex environments that try to use passwords, I&#x27;ve observed that the password spreads until everyone knows it and then nobody can change it because &quot;everyone already knows it and it would be a pain&quot;. Keys allow fine grained access and can theoretically be way more secure.<p>On the other hand, the last place I consulted for had their private key for production checked in to the main git repo, unencrypted. :-/",1382774710

The &#x27;good&#x27; student in this example cares more about gaming the signaling mechanism than actually learning the material - this is why he&#x27;ll spend his time arguing with the TA over a handful of points on his problem set than spending that time going over the material again. The &#x27;cynical bad&#x27; student is already convinced that he&#x27;s not going to get anything out of the class, in which case he either 1). is taking the class because he has to or 2). is a fool who should be taking a class better serving his needs and not wasting his time.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t know much about philosophy (and I suspect this is far less applicable for philosophy), but in science and engineering often mastery and innovation in a field requires an extremely narrow focus that, in turn, requires a significant investment in time and resources. This includes transmission of specialist knowledge to graduate students and postdocs, grant writing, paper publishing, acquisition of equipment or access to equipment. So I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s entirely fair to chalk up lack of interdisciplinary interest and/or innovative methodology predominantly to a system that weeds out people not willing to think the way it wants them to. (Not saying that tenure doesn&#x27;t have its own problems...)",1382774668

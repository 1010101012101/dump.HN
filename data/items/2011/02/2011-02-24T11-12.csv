2257598,comment,2257423,2257547,0,0,mduerksen,,,"I definitely disagree that Clojure introduces ""real world nastiness"" which would prevent a beginner from learning it ""the clean way"". Clojures data structures are very elegant and easy to grasp (e.g. you don't have to think about pointers or define equal operators, it's all there already). And you can define functions just as clean an ""pure"" as in Scheme.<p>I do agree that Clojure is very comprehensive, and can be overwhelming for a beginner. But you could buy a book, which will use only a subset of Clojure at the beginning.
And when you get to the point where you can use the basic data structures and <i>map, filter, reduce</i> them, this will get you <i>very far</i>.",1298548799

However, I don't believe the glue analogy is valid.

How do you sell to large corporations such as Red Bull, MillerCoors, Wahoo's etc?  It's just me, do I need someone with more experience in corp markets?  How often do I persist without bugging?  How do I approach corps and convince them to listen to me and see my product?
Thanks",1298545411

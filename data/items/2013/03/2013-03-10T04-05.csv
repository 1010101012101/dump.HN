Unchecked exceptions will blithely and without warning completely explode your stack. They're the Atomic Goto.<p>The only way to know whether you're going to get one is to check the documentation, where you can only hope that the API author -- and the author of every API he calls -- has actually documented the exceptions that get thrown, because the compiler will be no help whatsoever, and god forbid an API start throwing an exception later.<p>> <i>... try throwing a meaningful exception through Runnable or Iterator.</i><p>If you pass around an object that conforms to Iterator, but throw an exception within it, __YOU'RE BREAKING THE API CONTRACT.__<p>Anyone that relies on the API contract of the Iterator class could have their state completely walloped by the Atomic Goto you inserted with a runtime exception.<p>> <i>Stop it. JUST STOP IT. Checked exceptions have wasted hundreds of hours of my time, not just writing lame wrappers so that I don't have to type try/catch on every line of code, but also by making debugging and error handling five times more painful than it should be.</i><p>This makes no sense, because <i>more</i> work is required without checked exceptions.<p>Without checked exceptions:<p>- You must check the API docs for every line of code you write to see if it will throw an exception, and if so, what types.<p>- If it throws an exception, you must either add a try/catch block to handle the error appropriately (or wrap it in a new exception type), or you must add documentation to your method to declare that <i>it</i> will bubble up an exception, and of what type.<p>- If new exception types are thrown by underlying code, nothing tells you until your application explodes.<p>With checked exceptions:<p>- The compiler tells you what exceptions code throws, and of what type.<p>- If it throws an exception, you must either add a try/catch block to handle the error appropriately, or declare it in the method prototype. The IDE will do both of these things for you.<p>- If new exception types are thrown by underlying code, the compiler will warn you.<p>> <i>If you're still touting checked exceptions in 2013, you are part of the problem. Stop it. Java needs to evolve, and your fresh-from-1995 opinion is not helping.</i><p>Stop advocating broken API design and ignorance of API invariants.",1362891297

These events instead enforce the stereotype, segregating girls and giving them (and everyone) a message that they are different.  It is a band-aid attempt at a solution to a problem that starts at a much younger age, and seriously neglects those girls (and women) who dont want to be segregated (many of whom never even come out to such events, and whose voices are sadly never heard).  Children do not grow up into a segregated world, so why are we reinforcing that message?  Why are we not just creating a variety of activities that may appeal to boys or girls or both?  I can see taking issue with creating explicitly sexist activities, but there is nothing inherently sexist about having activities that may attract more of one gender than the other, especially when we make the available to everyone.

Alpha nerd had a two-parent home (probably a two-<i>income</i> home as well), with computers to practice on since he was a teenager (or earlier), didn't have to worry about being stabbed at school or shot at the public park, went to a public school with a stable and well-established tax base, etc. etc. Whereas Super Jock came from the slums, had to step over the passed-out crackheads on his way to walking miles to school in the morning, his dad was floating along from prison cell to prison cell and it would be even odds if his mother was drunk or not when he got home that evening from his hours of practice for the sport that represented his only effective chance at a stable life as an adult. Math homework? He don't have time for that shit!<p>Now obviously both of those are highly contrived, but the issue is that it doesn't even have to be that severe in practice to go from little individual effects to a noticeable high-level socio-economic effect.<p>Is affirmative action the answer to that? Hell man, I don't know. The underlying issues certainly go <i>much</i> deeper than just ""we should give more scholarships to poor minority candidates"", for all we know that's 10 years too late to even get minorities <i>interested</i> in STEM, let alone struggling to catch up with it.<p>But HELL YES the concept of ""competition"" applies to meritocracy. I'm not saying race <i>should</i> have something to do with a meritocracy, I'm saying that it <i>shouldn't</i>, and so are people who actually argue for affirmative action for future equality.",1362890113

Also, a lot of the big aerospace companies (such as Boeing) have surprisingly shallow experience with orbital rocketry (although it's improved a bit with the EELV generation). Very few folks at those companies actually had hands on experience with building or flying rockets, and even less experience with testing (as a rule most launch vehicles fly straight down the middle of the flight envelope as much as possible, so even in a vehicle like the Shuttle with 130+ flights that's nowhere comparable to having the same level of understanding or confidence in the vehicle if it had flown that many flights while exploring the envelope).",1362890055

I feel sick and irritated today, so I wont pretend political correctness.<p>Fuck this feminist, sexist shit.<p>First, I am the most orderly developer you could ever meet. My desk is absolutely clean. Everything has a well defined technical purpose there. Whenever I leave, those purposes cease to exist so I eagerly remove or put away those objects. I could walk in any day, pick up my desktop and get seated anywhere else.<p>computer games, science-fiction memorabilia and junk food?! Fuck that, who cares about that shit anyway? I might have a clean mug, but I aint never have no fucking plant. How could I be the nit-picking detail-obsessing code freak I am if I was careless with my physical environment in the functional domain? (I dont give a shit about aesthetics, most of the time.) Some of my colleagues' desks seem to be covered with pig shit, and I dont cease chiding them for it.<p>I treat my female coworkers with respect, I politely discuss technical stuff with them if they feel like. I do make sexist jokes if I was able to get to know them sufficiently before, like any healthy male. They mostly laugh and if they dont, I apologize and tune it down. They dont refrain from spicy topics, we even discuss that kind. My wifes male coworkers behave the same way and I have no problem with that. American overdriven political correctness shall get the fuck off my lawn.<p>Missing out on best career opportunities? Well, concentrate on the fucking task at hand, not irrelevant details. Suppose Id like to work in a fuckin' bakery but hate that the clothes are white (which doesnt mean in the least that they are clean). So who will start a crusade for me? If the circumstances of your otherwise coveted dream-job are accidental, try to change them. If they are intrinsic, live with them or leave.<p>I was never hostile towards women in IT. Women consider sexist jokes repugnant in conference presentations? Well, I dont go to no fucking conference, because I hate to travel, I hate to spend money, I hate the crowd. Networking is a lie if you dont work with your peers on actual projects for longer times. Presentations are slow, linear, non-searchable. Give me a fucking transcript, post it to reddit, and Im happy. Cant recommend anything else to women either.<p>In my college class we had this beautiful girl with huge boobs. She was smarter than any guy in the whole class. Did we envy her? Did we hate her? Hell no. We respected her and we constantly tried to bring her in discussions for her insights. Did we talk about her body among ourselves? Hell yes, were no monks!<p>The fact is, most girls cannot not care about stuff thats irrelevant in computer science / software engineering, and also lack the necessary attention to detail. They are simply not interested in it. Guess what, they have no place here, just like I could never be a historian or translator or lawyer or doctor, because I hate meeting new people. Im not enforcing this or some shit like that, I simply accept that most girls are like this for whatever reason and Im not trying to force them into IT. Id rather be happy if some guys left software development. (Yeah, yeah, Im conflating IT with compsci / sweng, who cares now.)<p>I practically dont shave, but Im clean. I never ever stink. Im not attractive to women I guess, but I dont give a flying fuck. Ive got a beautiful, intelligent, loving wife; I dont need to pretend. I wear sandals with socks because shoes are much too warm in the summer, and without socks I sweat like a pig. Dont like it? Have a good laugh; I dont care. I put on (clean) clothing items that are on the top of the respective stacks in my wardrobe. Are you a female whod like to work as a software developer but you feel you cannot work with me because of my inconsistent clothing? Be a fucking fashion model, then. I never treat, I never even feel an urge to treat female colleagues negatively because they arent slender, young, or clothe gray.<p>There is no problem with girls in IT. Theyre mostly not here because they dont want to. Pick any female-dominated non-sex-worker job. Yay, who is protecting the poor shunned males? American media is blowing this shit out of proportion again. (Or if the surveys are right, then american girls are out of their minds, which might be true anyways, with requiring an expensive as hell diamond ring for wedding, or so I read. WHAT THE FUCK?!)<p>The whole issue is being overcompensated now. On some technical forum Ive seen somebody ask for advice on whatever. Another user replied with a link to women.debian.org. What the fuck? Do we have men.debian.org? If youre no different wrt. technical matters, then you need no different website. If you need different treatment, then dont be surprised if youre treated differently.<p>Im tired of this shit.",1362889827

5350662,comment,5350581,5350581,11,0,tikhonj,,,"One of the reasons people don't like Comic Sans is because it was overused, largely thanks to being included with a bunch of default Microsoft tools. It was also use in the wrong contexts.<p>Amusingly, I think the same holds true of the typeface that sparked the whole thing: Time New Roman. Far too many people use it for far too much, sometimes in the wrong context. So maybe we should all use Times less too! (I tend to use Palatino or Garamond myself.)<p>I'm tired of seeing the same few fonts everywhere. For whatever reason Times and Comic Sans really stand out, but this really holds for all the ""web-safe"" fonts--which also happen to be the fonts everyone used to flock to in Microsoft Word.<p>Please consider branching out and using something else for your next document.",1362888648

Probably not, is it morally wrong to want a female on the team or say a non white male? I cannot see why it would be. Especially when we now know based on current research that even if the candidate is technically worse than another, the overall team benefits from the different viewpoints more than a ""star"" developer.<p>Again, I am not in agreement this is at all a moral decision from a hiring point of view or overall as a community/CS viewpoint. Why is it wrong to hire for better performance? Why is it wrong to want more females in CS? Most importantly, how does that conflate to being a morality tale? The latter question would be aided here in you explaining your philosophical underpinnings of why a single gender meetup to get more of that underrepresented gender in the community as being morally wrong.<p>The slave analogy is off base for this particular situation.",1362888118

Old Braun designs.<p>""So European electronic companies should not be pursuing the faster-quicker-cheaper road, but the beautiful-elegant-simple road"".\nI finally found the words to express well what I was thinking.",1203936507
123034,comment,123024,123024,0,0,aston,,,"Interesting, but simple to explain because people tend to operate on <i>unthinkability</i> rather than <i>hazard.</i><p>While the odds of dying in a car accident are (much) higher than dying in a plane accident, it's unthinkable that so many people die simultaneously from a method of transportation that intuitively feels less safe than a box rolling on the ground.<p>The only exception on that chart is the asteroid impact, which can probably be discounted because it's for all intents and purposes impossible in our lifetime.",1203936290

123031,comment,122628,122710,0,0,Elepsis,,,"Everyone who has ever had to work in IT cares. When you need 81 screws to replace a motherboard (as a previous example cited) you wind up spending a magnitude of time longer fiddling with a laptop just to fix it. Multiply that times 100 and you have long support times and disgruntled workers.<p>The attitude that a laptop has to have eighty billion screws to be well-engineered is nonsense. Thinkpads are the perfect example -- they are known for being extremely sturdy and tough, but also have a reputation for being remarkably easy to work with in terms of parts replacement, etc. Defending Apple for ""wanting to make sure it works perfectly"" does not hold water -- we may as well admit that they don't really want _you_ poking around in your own computer under any circumstances.",1203935699

It saddens me that ads are invading the software world too.<p>Advertisements are not a neutral way to make money. That model rewards massive infrastructure investment, control of information distribution, and overall low quality of the actual product.<p>It's very strange that one of Facebook's big problems is that their content is too interesting and meaningful to their users.",1203934786

HN members are trying very hard to avoid becoming the next reddit... we want to keep the signal/noise ratio high. Since you were posting in (and thereby validating) a topic that many viewed as fluff, you sort of got crucified. That said, I didn't vote your comment down.<p>Then again, I could be overanalyzing the entire situation, and it could just be that a lot of this community prefers sex alone ;).",1203934451
123027,comment,122826,122881,0,0,socmoth,,,"i asked the same question of a network phd student.  i got the simple text version, and i have no idea if it is valid or not, but the guy i know is very smart.<p>he says in all likelihood, a guy in charge setup a malicious route or ""report"" saying they could access youtube faster than they really could.  which means, everyone trying to get to youtube, went through pakistan because it was the fastest way to youtube.  so all youtube traffic went to pakistan, which was the ddos part.<p>why isn't this a huge problem?  it kinda is.  the system shouldn't be able to be taken down.  But, it isn't a huge problem because nobody actually does this.<p>Apparently, isps pay a lot for their access, and this kinda thing is a good way of paying a lot more and loosing all your money and not having internet, which is the opposite of the business they are in.<p>i've never ever heard of something like this happening, or about these 'reports.'  so... maybe nobody should listen to me.  but my friend is usually right about this stuff.",1203934188

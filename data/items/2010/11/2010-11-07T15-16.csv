The rational question to ask is ""what is the quality of life of low income workers?"" Who cares if some wealthy person is making a lot of money.. Why begrudge them their wealth? Where is the logic in that?<p>It is mostly accepted among economists that poor people are better off today than they were in the 1970s. Do you believe these economists are wrong? Good: That is an argument I'm happy to have with you- It is a relevant and rational argument. I suspect the economists are right, but I'm not 100% sure on this, either.<p>On the other hand, it's possible there are rich people that acquired their  wealth through underhanded means. Again, if you think this is the case I'm happy to have a discussion on that topic. I think there are many cases where this has proven to be true. However, it isn't relevant in a discussion on the situation faced by low income people, because the welfare of the poor and rich are separate issues. They are not linked in any simple-minded fashion.<p>In summary, I think the recent fad of discussing ""income inequality"" is a shell game that mixes together several unrelated issues and clouds attempts at rational conversation.

The Petabox consumes 6kW so let's be generous and call it 60kW of servo motors.<p>60kW is roughly 80hp. (I know this is a specious comparison in several ways but bear with me.) 80hp is enough power a small but highway-capable motorcycle. A single 60kW brushless DC motor weighs over 100kg. That's heavier than a good many of us HN readers.<p>Imagine a motor like that bolted to one long spindle of large platters--say the 99cm platters from a 1961 hard drive.<p>If these platters were remade with the data density of modern 2TB drives, how tall would the spindle be if this giant hard drive had a 10PB capacity? How over- or under-sized would our motor be?",1295121578

2107649,comment,2106553,2106553,0,0,techiferous,,,"I would add:<p>#11: Not realizing you can't imagine your future accurately.<p>Some changes you make are so significant it's like you are playing a whole new game.  If you don't realize this, then you will not be a good judge of whether to make the change.<p>For example, let's say you enjoy playing basketball.  Someone comes up holding a football and invites you to play football.  You don't realize that he's talking about a new game with new rules and a new environment.  You look at his oddly-shaped ball and imagine yourself trying to dribble that ball down the court.  You conclude that you wouldn't enjoy football.<p>I've made numerous significant life changes, among them becoming vegan and going car-free.  Both of those decisions are game-changing and so it's really hard to <i>imagine</i> yourself making those changes; you really have to just try it for a while before making up your mind.<p>For veganism, I often hear people say ""I could never give up  X"" or ""What do you eat?"".  They imagine themselves no longer eating their favorite foods, not realizing that after adjusting to veganism their palate will change and they'll have different favorite foods.  And they also don't realize the abundance of vegan foods out there because they've never had an incentive to look, so they just assume they'd be eating salads all the time.<p>Ditching my car was another game-changer.  I wouldn't recommend doing this unless you are in a well-designed city.  I moved from Norfolk, Virginia to Boston, Massachusetts and ditched my car in the process.  If I had imagined myself in the environment of Norfolk without a car, I would have never been tempted to do so.  But I had visited Boston and also had lived for a while in Germany without a car and so I knew what it was like to live in a well-designed city without a car.  Even so, I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of cost and inconvenience I was getting rid of by not having a car:  no more gas-filling eating away my time and money, no more large key fobs filling up my pockets, no more having to ask my friends if they know a good mechanic, no more driving around forever looking for a parking space, etc. etc.  All the inconveniences of owning a car were somewhat invisible beforehand and they didn't become quite so apparent until after actually ditching the car.<p>tl;dr: if you're making a significant life change, you can't accurately imagine what your new situation will be like by extrapolating from your past experiences.",1295121442

2107640,comment,2107238,2107572,0,0,shinkansen,,,"> Yes, that's pretty much the human intuition for why no one doubts that White will win. But it is very, very far from a mathematical proof.<p>White will win if he plays perfectly: this is mathematically assured because white has an advantage of nine points. The only way for white to lose or to draw is by extreme error. The article assumes a perfect game, so I too assume that white will play a perfect game.<p>> Let me remind you that each ply has a branching factor of about 20, which means each move has a branching factor of several hundred. In most positions you'd be lucky to be able to calculate even one or two forced exchanges, let alone all the way to the end of the game.<p>As I recall, Deep Blue was calculating at a depth of more than eight moves...<p>> The Deep Blue chess computer which defeated Kasparov in 1997 would typically search to a depth of between six and eight moves to a maximum of twenty or even more moves in some situations. -- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)</a><p>I find it difficult to believe that this wouldn't have improved or could not be improved upon, since this was based on the technology available in 1997. It's safe to say we've made progress since then.<p>While you may not be able to calculate an entire game, you could certainly calculate all the exchanges required to reach a properly winnable and calculable endgame. This is pretty damn close to being able to calculate a whole game...and you're assured victory.<p>As I said, once you get to a point of two kings and a queen, it's trivial.",1295121107

It is obvious to a rank beginner that a perfect game with a rook handicap is a win for the side with the material advantage. No, make it a queen! Surely that must be a provable win?<p>Hm, I'm sure it must be. Although I don't know how you go about proving it, it's a simple matter to force equal trades; black cannot avoid the exchange of pieces forever, and if white plays a perfect game he will always win, without doubt.<p>> Not so fast. Even against a crushing asymmetry in material, it is not too hard to avoid mate for a couple of dozen moves, which means that calculating all the way to the end of the game is beyond the reach of search-based algorithms.<p>Okay, just calculate the moves it would take to force the equal exchange of material from a given position. Generally as the game progresses and the board opens up it becomes inescapable.<p>After a certain point, when enough material has been removed from the board, looking for mate becomes trivial. Esp if you operate with such a commanding advantage as a queen...assuming you can force the equal exchange of all other material, it is possible to calculate checkmate within a couple of moves.",1295118101

Comparing U of Phx admissions/passing criteria to that of high level athletes at big schools is not exactly redeeming.  <i>Because everyone knows the idea of the scholar-athlete at major programs is a mostly a farce</i> (which is not to say there aren't exceptions).<p>Addition: And if you're simply trying to knock non-profit higher ed from a pedestal, my point is that it's already been knocked.  At the same time, there's a continuum of relaxed academic standards and capitalizing on certain types of enrollment, so U of Phx is not necessarily on equal standing simply because there are some concerning things happening at Big Football U.<p>Did you catch the law school article which was the #1 article for several days on nytimes.com this week?

This seems (unless I'm crazy) totally wrong. Classic coupons have purposes beyond promotion; for instance, capitalizing on price insensitivity. Classic coupons rarely offer huge discounts, or, if they do, they do it for a loss-leader product (and they do it infrequently).<p>Groupons offer huge discounts for a business' core offering for the sole purpose of attracting new customers. They're purely a promotion mechanism. They're a big deal not because coupons needed modernizing, but because they're a means for local businesses to cut out a middleman in promotional costs and spend that money directly on prospective customers.<p>Also, it's hard to take seriously a competitive analysis that doesn't recognize the network effects of group coupon sites; it's a winner-take-most market with a capital-intensive customer acquisition model (they're doing direct sales to tens of thousands of local businesses).",1295118038

My friends who work in HR tell me its actually the really crappy resumes that get noticed - but only so they can make fun of them and then toss them in the garbage. The good ones don't even grab attention - they just look like the hundreds of other good ones they've got on file.</i><p>Apparently, in 2011, HR departments make fun of bad resumes and toss them in the trash, rather than interviewing people with good resumes?<p><i>If you put this kind of effort in, opportunities will come to you. People will recognize you and your work. Your well earned reputation will precede you before you even walk in the door.</i><p>So the advice boils down to ""be famous""? That's great, if you can manage it, but there's a finite amount of fame out there: it's a zero sum game.<p>Perhaps this is atypical, but I just have a bog-standard resume, no twitter account, and a blog that probably averages 2 hits per week. Despite that, I haven't had a problem getting interviews by submitting my resume through company job websites. As this guy would say, there's nothing that makes my resume stand out from all the others they have on file: I got a BS from a state school, an MS from another state school, and have a job at a small startup no one's ever heard of. And when I interview, just knowing algorithms 101 seems to be sufficient to get a job offer (and not even necessary unless I'm interviewing at a place like MS or Google).<p>This guy makes landing a job sound a lot harder than it actually is.",1295118008

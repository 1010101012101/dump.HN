It&#x27;s like my saying &quot;A lot of the people on GitHub couldn&#x27;t build a program to display &#x27;Hello World!&#x27;&quot;<p>Many of the writers on Upwork who bid on jobs are worthless-- people who have trouble writing a coherent sentence. Others are fronts for offshore content mills.<p>You will also find (1) copywriters who got thrown out of work when their ad/PR agency folded, (2) reporters who have been laid off as their papers shrunk, (3) staff writers for magazines who quit to have kids (or, if they&#x27;re men) raise a child, (4) retirees who need cash, (5) people with disabilities who need to work from home or (6) someone working 40 hours, but looking to moonlight to make extra cash.<p>Unlike (say) database administration, where you can&#x27;t judge competence from a resume, you can evaluate a writer&#x27;s ability in 30 seconds-- ask for a writing submission and read what they write.<p>The $300-500 places price for one job-- that assumes they do it, you go away and they never see you again. Part of the cost is the research time they need to become knowledgeable. For people who can provide a steady income stream, they charge a lot less.<p>I think it&#x27;s simpler to find one of the many people who need work-- and would kill for a chance to make $100-$300 a piece-- but it&#x27;s up to you.",1446152396

It alone tells us nothing except that, not knowing the cause of this conviction rate, you must accept any plea bargain whatever it is.<p>To get a better understanding we would have to ask whether persons convicted under even the most careful trials (death penalty cases) are later exonerated eg <a href=""https://www.aclu.org/dna-testing-and-death-penalty"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.aclu.org/dna-testing-and-death-penalty</a><p>We might also ask whether jurors enter the courtroom convinced the defendant is guilty before the trial even starts. Even here it might a coincidence: the defendants are always guilty anyway so the prejudice of the juries is irrelevant. Or we have to convince ourselves that prejudiced jurors always become open minded somewhere between voir dire and jury instruction. I suggest the later is not too believable and the former outright disturbing.<p>We would have to explain why federal courts have significantly lower conviction rates than lower courts by saying something like lower court prosecutors prepare their cases better or federal judges are significantly more lenient. Intuitively neither explanation seems very satisfying.<p>Finally we&#x27;d have to explain how charges that a DA is willing to drop during a plea bargain are then proven beyond a reasonable doubt at trial and explain how such a system, however money saving, has anything to do with justice.<p>Ideally, given that the number of innocent people jailed is not zero, we&#x27;d determine objectively and openly what the number is and whether we are satisfied with that rate.",1446152319

We&#x27;re partnering with a local cell service provider (proximus.be) who are upgrading their base stations to be LoRa base stations and we&#x27;re a pilot installation because we&#x27;re developing software that does things with the sensor data (smart office type stuff, like adaptive cleaning schedules based on space utilization). The sensors are pre-configured for their network. You stick them to the wall, pull a latch, and they connect directly to the public base station, no additional hardware involved. Surprisingly, it works, and they&#x27;re claiming five years battery life.<p>There are some downsides though. The sensor+radio combo&#x27;s are custom orders for now, meaning they take too long to arrive and are too expensive. That issue will get solved over time. They also have an extremely low data rate. A single set of values every 15 minutes. That issue probably won&#x27;t be solved. Still, you can learn a lot from a CO2 reading or a door opening counter reading even if it&#x27;s only every 15 minutes.<p>The hard bit is the intelligent software that processes the data.

Because the <i>ends</i> of optimisations are observable, but their <i>means</i> are not, people resort to “butterfly programming”. As a small example, in ActionScript 3, people used to write their conditionals like this:<p><pre><code>    if (a) if (b) {\n      ...\n    }\n</code></pre>\nRather than this:<p><pre><code>    if (a && b) {\n      ...\n    }\n</code></pre>\nBecause the dumb compiler generated better code for the former.<p>In the real world, I’ve seen seemingly benign code changes prevent optimisations from firing—optimisations we didn’t know we were relying on. So people start coding to the implementation, rather than the language or the human, <i>without even being able to see what they’re doing</i>. I <i>really</i> don’t like that.<p>Optimisers are like garbage collectors—they give you better ergonomics than, and equal <i>average</i> performance to the manual alternative, if you’re willing to relinquish predictability and a non-voodoo mental model of your code’s performance.",1446151791

Ask the entire country in a free and fair manner and you&#x27;ll quickly discover that people&#x27;s opinions are not independent and do not exist in a vacuum. They may say to you they prefer living in a dictatorship because of a combination of not knowing anything else and pro-dictatorship propaganda. Or they may say &quot;democracy!&quot; because they drank the kool-aid.<p>I&#x27;m starting to believe that the only way to reach democracy as a stable state is for a society to naturally evolve towards it. Just leave it alone, let them figure things out; after a few generations they will probably sort out their culture and <i>then</i> they&#x27;ll have a democracy that&#x27;s sustainable because it&#x27;ll be backed by decades of cultural growth. Trying to speed this transformation up is a dangerous game. Trying to speed it up <i>with tanks and guns</i> is just crazy.",1446150660

For example, if you have two spaceships heading toward each other, the picture looks &quot;the same&quot; as if you pretend that one spaceship is stationary and the other is moving twice as fast, or vice versa.<p>This is not true only of <i>geometric</i> relationships, but also for the <i>laws of physics</i>: If you choose to view things in coordinate frame A, and apply the same laws of physics, you will still get the same predicted motion as if you had done the calculation in coordinate frame B. There is no experiment that can tell you which frame is &quot;moving&quot;, because you always get the same answer.<p>With your example of two rotating bodies, it is true that the picture looks <i>geometrically</i> &quot;the same&quot; if we pick a different rotating reference frame. The problem is that the laws of physics <i>do not</i> look &quot;the same&quot; under this transformation. If I choose a coordinate frame where the spinning astronaut is stationary, and I try to predict what will happen using the laws of physics of the original frame, I will get wrong results-- the motion of the yo-yo will look &quot;unphysical&quot; for a stationary system. So when you change between rotating and stationary coordinate frames, the laws of physics change too.<p>That means I can tell whether I am in an &quot;absolutely rotating&quot; coordinate frame by doing tests to measure the laws of physics (i.e. are there coriolis and centrifugal forces acting on me?), without any reference to some other, external frame.<p>So the fundamental question is under what circumstances the picture looks &quot;the same&quot;. In both cases, geometric relationships are equivalent, but in only one of the cases are the laws of physics <i>also</i> equivalent. The original article lied by saying the laws of physics are the same in the rotating case, and that is simply not true.<p>Does that make sense?",1446150167

So I went back to a) making stupid simple meals (roasted vegetables, baked chicken etc) b) restaurants/takeout.<p>I&#x27;m a bachelor so it wasn&#x27;t like I was doing some fun social thing when cooking. I&#x27;d listen to podcasts, which was nice, but I&#x27;d rather do that at the gym or getting some sort of exercise/relaxation done. Also, I&#x27;m absolutely fine with eating boring meals throughout the week. I&#x27;m practically on the fence about Soylent because I&#x27;d rather spend less time planning, shopping, cooking, etc.<p>The great thing that Blue Apron did was build up my kitchen confidence.",1446150156

The first prosecution was for failing to pay the tax, not &quot;technically&quot; for possession.<p>Nowadays, the argument that Congress lacks this power seems quaint!<p>I&#x27;d be willing to say that the overall trajectory of Constitutional protections is a mixed bag, but I&#x27;m really not convinced that overall the trend is towards increased Constitutional protections, <i>particularly</i> when it comes to protection from the executive arm of the federal government.<p>[0] for those who don&#x27;t know: possession was legal only if you had a stamp that demonstrated you&#x27;d paid tax on it. The stamps were impossible to get, therefore the product was impossible to possess legally: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marihuana_Tax_Act_of_1937#Operation_of_the_act"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marihuana_Tax_Act_of_1937#Oper...</a><p>[1] The 18th amendment appears to contradict this reasoning, but it actually serves as an example of this. First, the Marihuana[sic] Tax Act was different from a constitutional amendment (which required the approval of the states). Secondly, even alcohol prohibition was implemented in a similarly back-door way (banning &quot;manufacture, sale, or transportation&quot;, but not explicitly possession).<p>[2] (Yes, Congress is the legislative branch rather than the executive, but the question was whether the executive branch can actually obtain these powers at all)",1446149834

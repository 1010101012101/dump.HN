The BloombergView piece by Matt Levine [1] is much better:<p>&quot;It&#x27;s important to realize that slowing everyone down by 350 microseconds can&#x27;t possibly help anyone. As Hudson River Trading said in its comment letter: &quot;Similar to a 100-meter sprint, if you simply add 350 microseconds to each participant’s time, neither the order in which they finish nor their time differentials will change.&quot;&quot;<p>It would indeed be pointless if everything was slowed down by 350μs, which is why that is not the case. IEX lets its own &quot;pegged orders&quot; and &quot;routable orders&quot; cut the line, picking off liquidity at the other exchanges. If IEX is approved, there will be an arms race, with other exchanges inserting their own similar delays. Even worse, because of Reg NMS you can&#x27;t legally avoid trading on IEX even if you wanted to. If the price of a stock is falling rapidly and you wanted to sell, IEX will always have the best price since it is stale by 350μs. Everyone will be forced to send their orders to IEX, even if everyone knows that the bid there is illusory.<p>The Matt Levine piece is very good. Do please read the whole thing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-12-22/the-flash-boys-exchange-is-still-controversial"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-12-22/the-flash-b...</a>",1451134515

Around the same age, though my circumstances were different - My spouse had a suicide attempt, new bipolar/schizo affective diagnosis, nearly lost all income and had to move back to my parents place. It took some time for me to work out of it and wound up leaving him, but I am ever so happy that I did so. Life isn&#x27;t perfect now, but much more happy. It isn&#x27;t too late to start or change life. \n   First things first, take care of your housing. It&#x27;ll be an uncomfortable talk with your parents. Admit things, regardless of embarassment, and either tell them your plans or admit to your own confusion. This will take some of your worries away.\n   Second, money. Any job will do. Try to do well at it, and find bits you like with it. The reality is that you might not be able to support yourself, by yourself - As in, countless people and their families are in the same situation. It is an unfortunate new reality, and easier on the mind if you view your situation as more normal than not. I oddly wound up with a retail job at a pharmacy and thrived: I&#x27;m currently taking language classes (I&#x27;m now an immigrant) that have a focus on health care terms so that when I re-job, I&#x27;ll like it better. \n    Third, give yourself a break. You are still reeling from the breakup, plus the life situations. Friends - I&#x27;ve always struggled to have friends. I tend to have very few, but I get my social needs met between that, any job/school/volunteering and the internet. Get active somehwere, anywhere - to get your mind off things.",1451134208

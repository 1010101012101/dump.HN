In High School and above, sports became deadly serious (scholarship, scholarship, SCHOLARSHIP!!!), but before that it was almost simply playtime. I don&#x27;t remember ever being stressed about Soccer or Track and Field.<p>Even in High School, Track and Field remained a &quot;fun&quot; sport for me (I can&#x27;t fathom why anymore, but I remember enjoying running in the rain, and up/down stairs and everything). It was pretty much &quot;stay at your own pace&quot;, since there were so many people at different skill levels.<p>I can imagine organized High School play to be stressful for a teenager, but I can&#x27;t fathom being stressed about any sport before then.",1379541573

In 2011, it&#x27;s 24% tenure or tenure track, 57% non-tenure-track, and 19% grad students.<p>Now, part-time employees may make up a smaller proportion of actual teaching time than full time, but remember also that tenure track professors and grad students spend time doing research as well, not all of their time is spent teaching.<p>How many of your professors did you know the status of? I know that that certainly wasn&#x27;t something I kept close tabs on when I was in college; there were a few professors who I knew well enough to know their status as tenured, tenure track, or not tenure track, but for many I didn&#x27;t pay attention. Many of the adjunct professors are likely teaching intro-level classes that everyone is required to take; your freshman English or writing or math requirements.<p>Also recall that the more prestigious the school, the less likelihood that they will rely heavily on adjunct professors. Smaller state schools, community colleges, and for-profit schools may use them more often. Edit to add: the AAUP has another report that breaks down the faculty by school, and you can clearly see that these kind of non-tenure track and part time professorships are much more common at community colleges, smaller less prestigious schools, and for-profit schools, with some of them having 100% contingent (non-tenure track) faculty: <a href=""http://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/files/AAUPContingentFacultyIndex2006.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/files/AAUPContingent...</a><p>And further, they may be named different things, but be roughly equivalent in job security, prestige, and benefits.

6408425,comment,6405660,6405997,1,0,tesseractive,,,"I remember I was the lead developer at a small software company, and we had an annual user conference with some training sessions. As the &quot;big picture&quot; software person, I didn&#x27;t have to lead &quot;how to use the software&quot; sessions, but I did have to give sessions on things like platform direction.<p>I remember one time... it might have been the second of these presentations I ever gave, I think? I was just really nervous at the beginning of the presentation. I don&#x27;t know why it happened then as opposed to the first time or the third time, but for whatever reason, that&#x27;s when it happened. And I could tell my voice was quavering in a way that had to be obvious to everyone, so it was like the sort of public speaking moment that people who are scared of public speaking are afraid of. It was pretty nerve wracking.<p>So basically all I did was force myself to keep going, quavering and all. The audience was completely sympathetic -- they were at the conference to learn about our software, so they wanted me to succeed at telling them about it. So even if it started out rocky, they were paying attention. And after a couple of minutes of not getting booed out of the room, I managed to settle down, get my voice under control, and make everything go more smoothly the rest of the way.<p>Now that I know what can happen if public speaking goes badly, and know that it&#x27;s almost certainly going to be ok even if it does, I don&#x27;t let it stress me as much. I still get nervous, but it&#x27;s never any sort of paralyzing fear or anything. I know if I just find a way to keep going, I can probably make it work out ok.<p>That&#x27;s actually true of an awful lot of things in life.",1379541474

Pretty much all the load balancers/reverse proxies are written in C too. Hmm.... is it maybe possible that it isn&#x27;t always better to use C++ instead of C?<p>No, they were developed by open source Linux guys that only care about C in what concerns compiled languages.<p>C++ was always badly received by the Linux community, in contrast with commercial UNIXes.<p>> IIS => C++/C#\n> Yup, the one outlier no doubt owes about 0% of its success to its tech stack. In general, if you don&#x27;t work at Google and want a C++ web server on anything other than Windows, you are looking at a C++ server framework that has an embedded HTTP stack (tntnet, Wt, etc.).<p>Yes, nothing like contributing to have more insecure servers around.<p>>> That is my hope, after all we only need a few generations of developers and then the issue is taken care of by itself.<p>> I think you missed my point. ;-)<p>I surely got your point, but it is not about Darwin of languages, rather of developers.",1379541470

The elevated pulse, the sweat, blurred vision -- it&#x27;s fight or flight response the entire way.</i><p>This might blow your mind or it might not, but there&#x27;s a medicine called Propanolol that can basically eliminate the elevated pulse/shaking/sweats. Performers sometimes use it to combat stage fright. It&#x27;s nonaddictive and doesn&#x27;t affect your cognitive skills.<p>We sometimes get into a feedback loop of: fight-or-flight kicks in, brain freaks out which pushes fight-or-flight further, which freaks out our brain even further, etc. Propanolol short circuits the physiological side, so you&#x27;re only battling your brain (instead of your brain and your body feeding off each other).<p>I had a bout of anxiety last year sparked by an unpleasant situation, and therapy helped but the fight-or-flight responses were absolutely crippling. My MD and therapist both suggested the medicine, so I gave it a shot and it&#x27;s wonderful. I liken it to an armor on my body&#x27;s responses. My mind may get freaked out but when my body doesn&#x27;t react in kind, it&#x27;s easy now with practice to settle down.<p>Anyway, sounds like you may have figured out your own solution, but I&#x27;m leaving this here for you or anyone else who might find it useful.

Using computers, just like interacting socially, is a _skill_. Skills take practice. Being a social butterfly is not &quot;normal&quot;.

One of the reasons Apple has done so well is that Apple has managed to capture the relatively price-insensitive part of that market segment, and as a result their average revenue per unit is north of $1000.<p>The average price per unit for PC&#x27;s on the other hand has been steadily declining to the ~$500 level.<p>> Contrary to the current hype, mobile is not going to replace the desktop/laptop except at the low end.<p>So 95%+ of the market, in other words.

However I think that so long as there is an easy &quot;ejection seat&quot;, the &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;-esque aspects can be kept reasonable.<p>I&#x27;ve mentioned this on HN before, but when I was a child I was a boy scout and my experiences in that organization left a very bad taste in my mouth.  Specifically during long camping trips you would frequently get very strong &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; type situations that would escalate for days on end.  When I was just at home, getting in stick fights and throwing rocks with neighborhood kids in the woods, any of us could always just run home when the others began to get absurdly out of line.  On long camping trips with BSA there was no such escape.  Although I was never really the victim of those situations, on several occasions things did plainly get out of hand.<p>Tearing around the neighborhood looking for trouble though?  I think that is fine.  As long as kids can reasonably tap themselves out, and don&#x27;t remain locked into the situation for days on end, I don&#x27;t think there is a risk of much permanent damage.  Most common worse case scenario: some kids just don&#x27;t play with the others; no big deal.<p>Edit: Thinking about it more, having evenings &quot;off&quot; also probably provides a much needed &#x27;cool down&#x27; time for kids to reflect and prevent strong &#x27;cult of personality&#x27; situations from taking root.  Constant exposure allows mini-tyrants to get people under their thumb in a way that just cannot be replicated.  Constant exposure probably explains a lot of what I experienced.",1379539753

Has anyone ever raised a constitutional argument for any use of a copyrighted work outside of the scope you have mentioned, which looks to be very clear that it only applies to religious gatherings, or has anyone questioned what constitutes a &quot;place of worship&quot; in our modern age?

Yes, the eye tracking is interesting and works reasonably well, but it&#x27;s not in any way paradigm-shifting. I definitely didn&#x27;t feel anything like I was seeing a historically significant innovation.<p>Most importantly, as far as I can tell, it doesn&#x27;t make any existing smartphone activities easier or faster, nor does it make possible any new category of activity. Games are neat, but who is going to make games for a platform no one is on?<p>I agree with the other commenter, however, that Amazon is mostly interested in gathering detailed data on how people use their phones, and even a small percentage of the market is still a lot of useful data. They may learn something interesting (those eye-tracking cameras aren&#x27;t there just for the sake of the UI), in which case they will be better positioned to increase their market share if they want to.",1410476316

8305679,comment,8305283,8305656,7,0,mjn,,,"Looking at the code, it looks like deallocating a hash table requires traversing the entire table, because there is malloc()&#x27;d memory associated with each hash entry, so each entry has to be visited and free()&#x27;d. From hash_free() in coreutils hash.c:<p><pre><code>    for (bucket = table->bucket; bucket < table->bucket_limit; bucket++)\n      {\n        for (cursor = bucket->next; cursor; cursor = next)\n          {\n            next = cursor->next;\n            free (cursor);\n          }\n      }\n</code></pre>\nWhereas if you just don&#x27;t bother to deallocate the table before the process exits, the OS will reclaim the whole memory block without having to walk a giant data structure. That&#x27;s a fairly common situation in C programs that do explicit memory management of complex data structures in the traditional malloc()/free() style. Giant linked lists and graph structures are another common culprit, where you have to pointer-chase all over the place to free() them if you allocated them in the traditional way (vs. packing them into an array or using a userspace custom allocator for the bookkeeping).",1410476304

Gas stations which sell at a higher markup go out of business. Gas stations which sell inferior product get a bad reputation, and go out of business. The market takes care of itself, without a regulator having to intercede at any point.<p>In most places I&#x27;ve been inthe US , <i>every individual gas pump</i> has a seal from a local government inspector certifying -- with a date -- the inspection of the individual pump.

However, after seeing how long it took to rebuild an array after a drive failed (over 3 days), I&#x27;m much more hesitant to use those RAIDS.  I much rather prefer RAID 1+0 even though the overall cost is nearly double that of RAID 5.  It&#x27;s much faster, and there is no rebuild process if the RAID controller is smart enough.  You just swap failed drives, and the RAID controller automatically utilizes the back up drive and then mirrors onto the new drive.  Just much faster and much less prone to multiple drive failures killing the entire RAID.",1410475860

It seems to be a much more mature file system, and Redhat-family distros (RHEL, Centos, Scientific, etc) have switched to XFS as the default filesystem (instead of moving to ext4 from 6.x&#x27;s default of ext3; 6.x does not support XFS or ext4 for root).<p>XFS performs better out of the box on a wide range of hardware, while seemingly giving stronger data reliability guarantees (but not anywhere near ZFS&#x27;s).<p>ZFS on a single disk, however, will still give you data checksumming, so you can detect silent data corruption.

8305564,comment,8303274,8305479,1,0,beloch,,,"One thing most homeless people need in order to find a home is income. Being homeless carries a huge stigma with it that can make it difficult to find a job, so low-income (or no-income) housing is indeed immensely important.  However, one big problem with such housing is that it often isn&#x27;t that close to jobs.  People who can&#x27;t afford a home often can&#x27;t afford a car either, and Austin&#x27;s (for example) public transit is a hot steaming pile of garbage. Rich people in the suburbs typically don&#x27;t want low-income housing next to their homes or shopping malls so, indeed, zoning is an issue.  Concentrating low-income housing in one area creates a lot of problems.<p>Another major problem is that there is a large correlation between being homeless and mental issues.  In Canada, you can go on welfare and get housing if you need it, but you have to jump through hoops and interact with government employees to do so.  Some people just aren&#x27;t able or willing to do that.  Of course, the climate is rather deadly up here for large portions of the year.  There are shelters that the homeless can go to, but there are always those who seem to prefer sneaking into abandoned buildings or sleeping on transit vehicles.  Persuading these people to get off the streets takes a lot more resources than people expect, so those resources just aren&#x27;t there a lot of the time.<p>Perhaps small, spartan, stand-alone shelters that aren&#x27;t in large blocks of low income housing and aren&#x27;t formally assigned would attract those unwilling to seek other forms of shelter.",1410474654

If a piece of software reaches a point of exceptional quality - the developers working on it still have to fill 40 (likely more) hours a week to appease bosses.  And so they do the only thing available - they ruin the product.  This is one of the reasons that I think software engineers should, in certain cases, work on retainer.  Domain knowledge of a specific product is very valuable, and companies routinely ignore this.  They will shuffle an engineer off to some newer project and leave a more junior person to handle maintenance of the original project - and that junior person will have to fill their time somehow.

A bacterium will not evolve to be an astronaut in a billion bacterial lifetimes.  If it&#x27;s good enough to live in my gut, or another gut, it&#x27;s evolved sufficiently.<p>We know that environments have not been static, creating evolutionary pressure, and novel mutations then have a chance of producing increased adaptation in the changed environment.  We can only assume humans evolved the brain necessary to adapt to the existing environment.<p>The question arising out of these ideas is our brain evolved sufficiently that no further evolution is necessary.  If we are able to adapt to changing environments using the brain we have, it wouldn&#x27;t need to evolve.<p>In a way global warming and all that it implies are a kind of natural experiment of the hypothesis.  We must figure out a way to repair the damage to the planet, or adapt to it, otherwise we would predict disaster for current lifeforms including humans, and evolutionary processes will shape the successor species of the future.",1410472929

I couldn&#x27;t believe it.<p>I was asking anyone who knew anything... &#x27;so if two admins were logged in at the same time and made two zvols, they could basically ruin their filesystem&#x27;? No one knew for sure. Crazy stuff.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m quite glad that&#x27;s safe now.",1410472862

They got phones out into the world; they found out to whom their brand on a phone is appealing (0.2% of mobile use is still a lot of people in terms of raw numbers); Amazon is able to collect live data on real use; and they can correlate all of this against the Kindle and Fire and their sales of physical goods.<p>To put it another way, they couldn&#x27;t get this data any other way. It&#x27;s not dissimilar to Microsoft and the Pre - real field testing is expensive but the only realistic way to come up with a long term strategy. And like Microsoft mobile phones are an important space for Amazon, but not necessarily core critical.<p>Apple doesn&#x27;t have warehouses full of shoes and appliance parts and used books and neither does Google.

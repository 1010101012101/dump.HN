But I never heard about ""Ningda""...<p>Most common rural guys I know want to be a boss deep in their hearts, but they are less likely to reveal that to a foreigner. Chinese people are quite shy about their dreams. On the other hand, it is probably better to ask this question in urban regions. If someone goes to a Texas farm and ask their opinions on founding Internet Startups, probably the answers won't be very encouraging as well.<p>One thing I like about the Gaokao (University Entrance Exam) system: it is good for one thing - the family connections matter less than in US for this matter. As long as your score is impressive enough, you are in Tsinghua / Peking.<p>And that's why I have some faith in China. China has this ""Exam to Win"" system for 1400 years:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_examination"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_examination</a>\nwhich explains why the Chinese are so good at it.<p>Take a look at the President of China (Hu Jintao). He has no family background at all (surprise), and got into the best university by his own efforts. But we only heard media fussing about Obama being the American Dream.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu_Jintao"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu_Jintao</a><p>""Though his father owned a small tea trading business in Taizhou, the family was relatively poor. His mother was a teacher and died when he was seven, and he was raised by an aunt.

Actually I find it a bit scary that almost all of the smartest young people I know are now in it, and they are not naive teens - most of them are i-bankers / phds in top WallSt firms and US universities. Think about what will happen in 20 years).<p>Interesting enough, all of the 9 persons has no connections as well (except for the newly elected and soon-to-be-president Xi, who is the son of a former Vice-Premier. China is following the same path as every other developed country). What's more interesting: they are all Engineers. Shocking fact: China is a country running as a machine (at least at the highest level). Engineers couldn't care less about the people, but you can bet the country surely ""move fast and break things"". China = Crazy Startup (and yes, employees do suffer. No talk of democracy in companies). Consider this: if China is really so deeply corrupted, how come it is also developing so fast?<p>Eventually the lawyers and businessmen will take over and people will talk about China being the ""largest democracy"". Good thing for the people. I am not sure whether it will be good for the country. Aren't the people more important than the country? Or not? Tough question.

That's why B2B is so attractive: Your users actually WANT to pay you such that you are dependent on their happiness.<p>Maybe we should invent a new model that combines open source with paid incentives for user desired changes. Let's say User A uses Gimp, sees something that could be simplified or added. He can't program it himself but what he can do is describing the feature he wants, possibly with screenshots or even an interface prototype. He then auctions this on a marketplace website. Other users can upvote or even chip in to A's auction such that the probability of a good developer implementing it rises. Developers have their profile with reputation, possibly linked with their stackoverflow reputation. The change gets implemented within a branch of gimp, installable by anyone using a modified package manager.

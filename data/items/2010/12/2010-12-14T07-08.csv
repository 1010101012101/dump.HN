No wonder the students are there just to get it over with.<p>We're dealing with semantics here, however I disagree that education is mainly an action you take upon yourself.  Ideally it would be, however we are far from that being a reality for the general population.  Today one receives an education dictated (partly by you), however mostly by others (schools, universities).  The specific action under your control is to learn.  Learning can only be done by you (because of your goals), however supplying the means or environment to learning can be the job of someone else (to assist you in your learning process, assist you in your education).<p>> What students need are role models...<p>That's exactly what I was trying to say.

See bottom of this comment for some free promo codes ;)<p>Ok, I'm really very happy with the design. It keeps to the 960px grid (16 columns), is NOT just a PSD template with my content slapped into and the PSD is nicely formatted with all the right layers, etc. The header graphic is handmade in photoshop, not some stock picture. This might have taken a while to do! There are also some details I really like. For example Marco took the time to add the reflection layer to the screenshot in the iPhone, etc (of course with layer effects, so I can easily change the screenshot itself)<p>For me the design is a great starting point to make a nice looking website. I made some minor changes (added an iPad graphic next to the iPhone on top), will add a nice video and image viewer and create an iPhone sized version of the site, but I don't think I would have ended up with such a nice design if I tried myself.<p>Ok, here's the promo codes (now worldwide, yay) for my SpeedBox iPhone/iPad app. Sorry for kind of hijacking this thread, it's really a coincidence that the update was released today and I just feel like giving away a couple of codes ;)<p>E3MRYLRYLPKF

There is a major highway there, and many populous cities along the shore. As you go inland a ways there is a giant desert and then a giant mountain range – it seems reasonable that such areas are thus less populated. Many parts of that map have ""giant bright lines"" along coastlines (for example, Spain, Australia, northwest Africa).",1292310006

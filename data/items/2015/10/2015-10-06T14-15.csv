10339300,comment,10338562,10338562,0,0,notacoward,,,"I agree that programming <i>as a career</i> sucks a lot more than it used to.  I understand that part of my saying so is the result of changes in me or my own circumstances.  Life was better when I didn&#x27;t have to deal so much with product and project managers, when I didn&#x27;t have to be the &quot;leader&quot; creating momentum and mentoring those who don&#x27;t want to be mentored.  I do miss the days when I was an individual contributor minding my own business.<p>On the other hand, that doesn&#x27;t explain everything.  As the computing industry has become bigger and more lucrative, it has also become less like a gentleman&#x27;s race and more like a cage fight.  The primary mode of interaction has shifted from collaboration to competition.  There are always more projects in any given space, creating more factions each more determined to sling FUD at each other so that their project and their investment in it stay relevant.  There are more sub-sub-domains of knowledge, with those on the peaks of each sneering at the others.  The environment for women has become measurably <i>worse</i> than it used to be; I worked with a higher percentage of women on Encore&#x27;s kernel team twenty years ago than I do now even at Red Hat.  It&#x27;s a nasty, aggression-soaked environment, and anybody who doesn&#x27;t believe that must not have read the other comments on this very page.  I can tell you, it didn&#x27;t used to be that way.<p>Programming as an activity has its ups and downs.  Programming as a career has started to just plain suck.",1444143585

I think that best thing is that you don&#x27;t have to use React to use Redux.

The remaining problems are much harder and require the efforts of many, many more people to attack, but the archaic structure of the Prize means 99% of them can never be rewarded.<p>I used to work on an extremely similar experiment to SNO and Super-K. I played a small but key role in getting the thing to work at all. (I like to think things went a lot smoother with me helping out than they would have with someone else doing my job, but you never can tell, can you?)<p>Did this year&#x27;s Prize recipients contribute more to science than the people at the bottom of the ladder? I don&#x27;t know, I didn&#x27;t work on those experiments. I also know that you should not under-value leadership. On the experiment I worked on (and now you see why I&#x27;m not naming it), one of the top people -- one of the candidates for any major awards or prizes -- was a total and complete fool and roadblock, in the classic style of legendarily terrible senior managers. Yet he has received a lion&#x27;s share of the credit for this mismanagement. (To be fair, there were plenty of other top people who <i>were</i> good at their jobs.)<p>My direct supervisor on this project seemed to deal with this by wanting his fingers in as many pies as possible. I can only explain his behavior by speculating that he <i>really, really</i> wanted a Nobel Prize. But he will almost certainly never win one. To get a Prize in experimental particle physics these days, you must be a senior member of an experiment, and you must be very, very lucky that your experiment turns out to be Prize-worthy. This guy seemed to want to be involved in as many experiments as he could so that <i>one</i> of them would work out. But that meant he had little attention for each project, could not rise to the top levels of any of them, and generally never made as much total impact as if he&#x27;d concentrated on just getting one thing right. If our hunches were correct, and his life goal really is a Nobel Prize, it&#x27;s kind of sad to think this talented scientist is on a life course that will only distract him with mirages, never bringing him towards his real goal.<p>In any case, the hundreds of us working on the experiment knew that we would never receive any high-level acknowledgements of our work, no matter how important our contributions were to the project. And that, I think, was a small but meaningful contributor to why I left science for engineering. (More importantly, I found while working on the project that I preferred engineering and am personally more fulfilled, as well as better paid, this way, but observations like that aren&#x27;t going to improve modern science.)",1444143218

So is it better to stand mute rather than deny an accusation? Apparently not, because “when accusations or assertions are met with silence, they are more likely to
feel true.”44<p>To the extent this psychological research is applicable to trials, it tends to refute the notion that the prosecution pulls the heavy oar in criminal cases. We believe that it does because we assume juries go about deciding cases by accurately remembering all the testimony and weighing each piece of evidence in a linear fashion, selecting which to believe based on assessment of its credibility or plausibility. The reality may be quite different. It may be that jurors start forming a mental picture of the events in question as soon as they first hear about them from the prosecution witnesses. Later-introduced evidence, even if pointing in the opposite direction, may not be capable of fundamentally altering that picture and may, in fact, reinforce it.45 And the effect may be worse the longer the prosecution’s case lasts and, thus, the longer it takes to bring the contrary evidence before the jury. Trials in general, and longer trials in particular, may be heavily loaded in favor of whichever party gets to present its case first—the prosecution in a criminal case and the plaintiff in a civil case. If this is so, it substantially undermines the notion that we seldom convict an innocent man because guilt must be proven to a sufficient certainty. It may well be that, contrary to instructions, and contrary to their own best intentions, jurors are persuaded of whatever version of events is first presented to them and change their minds only if they are given very strong reasons to the contrary.&quot;",1444142325

I dislike the term &quot;microservices&quot; because for most organizations all it does is plant a flag all the way across the yard from &quot;monolithic.&quot; Suddenly the guys at the top have a new buzzword and the engineers are all trying to make their services as small as possible so they&#x27;re micro enough.<p>Most of the gotchas the article mentions aren&#x27;t logical consequences of decomposing into smaller services at all. You don&#x27;t have to have different data stores for each service. You don&#x27;t need to &quot;marshal data&quot; between services. If a service needs to call a service it&#x27;s just a client like any other client, so if we want to call standard http request/response handling &quot;marshaling&quot; I guess it will sound more complex and scary. Breaking a monolithic app into smaller pieces doesn&#x27;t increase complexity, it reduces it. And to the extent you have more things to monitor that probably means you can now monitor and control things that were more or less invisible outside the log data in the monolithic architecture.<p>More importantly, decomposing a problem into logically related areas of functionality that can execute separately allows you to make the most efficient use of compute resources, and it is consistent with the idea of favoring multi-processing over multi-threading. In almost every way groups of simpler things collaborating makes much more sense than large complicated things that do all.

The difference is that in the other two cases, the Fed saw itself as lending against reasonable collateral.<p>In the case of the Fed’s loans that facilitated the acquisition of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase, $29 billion of Fed money was at risk against a collection of Bear Stearns assets thought to be worth $30 billion. JPMorgan would absorb the first $1 billion if the value of those assets declined, providing a cushion ahead of the Fed (that is, ahead of taxpayers). Those assets were good in the end, with the Fed fully repaid with interest.<p>In the case of A.I.G., the Fed’s loans were collateralized by the entire assets of the firm, based on the observation that A.I.G. had potentially huge losses at its unit that sold credit default swaps but the rest of the firm was a successful insurer. The latter parts — the rest of the company — provided the collateral for the Fed’s initial loans, and eventually TARP funds were substituted for the Fed resources to provide the company with a better capital base rather than Fed loans. To be sure, it was hard to know in September 2008 that the value of the company would offset the potential losses in A.I.G.’s financial products division, but this turned out to be the case, with both the Treasury and the Fed turning considerable profits on their investments in A.I.G.<p>Such a successful outcome was simply less imaginable with Lehman than with either Bear Stearns or A.I.G. To all eyes, the problem at Lehman was one of solvency while the issue in the other two cases was liquidity. The Fed’s actions on Bear and A.I.G. were thus appropriate in its role as a lender of last resort and the same with its caution at Lehman. Indeed, after Lehman had filed for bankruptcy, the Fed did extend loans to allow the firm’s broker-deal subsidiary to function, but in bankruptcy these loans could be fully collateralized by assets within the brokerage subsidiary and not encumbered by obligations in other parts of the larger firm.</i> [1]<p>Basically, Bernanke knew that Lehman owned a bunch of worthless paper whereas firms like AIG, GM, Fannie Mae + Freddie Mac, Goldman, etc. owned actual valuable assets that they could use as collateral against taxpayer loans, and operated in profitable segments outside of risky IB and junk-debt securitization. He was tight-lipped about saving Lehman Bro&#x27;s because he wanted the private sector to step up and do it themselves, and also so that they wouldn&#x27;t know whether or not to expect handouts from the Fed down the road.<p>Although I disagree with Bernanke&#x27;s decision to adhere to Keynesian economics during the economic crisis, valuing short-term stability over properly setting precedents for long-term prosperity and growth, I have to respect the man for his intelligence and thoughtfulness. Looking forward to reading his account of the crisis and why he made the decisions that created the economic environment as it currently stands.<p>[1] <a href=""http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/why-lehman-wasnt-rescued/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/why-lehman-wasn...</a>",1444142088

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission confirmed that in January 2003, the Microsoft SQL Server worm known as “Slammer” infected a private computer network at the Davis-Besse nuclear power plant in Oak Harbor, Ohio, and disabled a safety monitoring system for nearly five hours. Fortunately the plant was off-line at the time. In January 2008, the Central Intelligence Agency reported knowledge of four disruptions, or threatened disruptions, by hackers of the power supplies for four cities.</i><p>Clearly, these attacks have been ongoing for a while. NAE also points out keeping software updated can lag far behind the threats:<p><i>Another problem today is that security patches are sometimes not supplied to end-users, or they are supplied but are not applied for fear of impacting system performance. Current practice is to apply an upgrade/patch only after SCADA vendors have thoroughly tested and validated it, which can sometimes take several months.</i>",1444141555

The idea that the EU could be right to hold a US corporation accountable to their laws never even occurs.<p>No American could ever conceive of establishing the HQ of a US corporation outside the US -- except maybe as part of a skeevy tax dodge.  The US is the best place in the world to live, work, and run a business.  Why would you want to go anywhere else?  To be fair, most of the US companies that do establish some sort of off-shore setup <i>are</i> engaging in some sort of skeevy tax dodge.",1444141214

Reading the latest paper by the guy the author keeps citing, Michael Woodley, I&#x27;m astounded at the ad hoc nature of the arguments [1]. Eg - Woodley cites a study that did an analysis showing visual reaction time has been increasing over time [2]. This study compared measurements performed in in 1800, to 1941. Woodley has been citing this article over and over again [3], to the point where the author of the original article wrote a letter to the journal &#x27;Intelligence&#x27; saying that Woodley is over interpreting his data [4]. Woodley&#x27;s conclusions have also been criticised elsewhere [5]. Woodley also tries to justify his &#x27;dysgenic fertility&#x27; theory by saying that there are now fewer geniuses in the world because we aren&#x27;t discovering amazing things like quantum mechanics as frequently - which is clearly complete nonsense. I would be highly sceptical of this based on the evidence presented.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4404736/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4404736/</a>

I don&#x27;t think most people realize just how close it came to stopping the entire worlds economy.<p>The problem with Lehman was that it was a large prime broker for many hegde and pension funds.  That essentially means its a bank that holds the holding(cash, stock and bonds) of these funds.<p>When it went bankrupt in the US, what was expected was that each of the funds would pull out their holdings and move them to healthier prime brokers.<p>This would have the double bonus of removing one unhealthy company(Lehman) and at the same time propping up other healthier companies by having them handle the assest of the funds pulling their holdings out of Lehman( sort of like letting a bank fail and having deposits put into other banks.<p>Unfortunately the British financial regulators, who built London on a program of pretty much anything goes style regulation, woke up that day and decided that for the first time ever they needed to actually regulate and they declared Lehman&#x27;s assets frozen, meaning that otherwise healthy funds (including pension, mutual, and hedge) now had no access to their own assets.<p>So now hedge funds can&#x27;t trade, pension funds can&#x27;t pay people and mutual funds can&#x27;t allow redemption&#x27;s and the other banks can&#x27;t take in these assets to prop themselves up.  The equity markets started to seize up as funds had no assets to trade.<p>The capital markets nearly seized up.  Repo desks are the portion of banks that lend money to each other to ensure everyone has the money they need to operate, suddenly couldn&#x27;t get money and weren&#x27;t allowed to lend out money for fear of lending to a company who might go bankrupt.<p>Almost all large companies these days operator on this over night borrowing, using this to smooth out cash flows, similar to using a line of credit.<p>General Electric had 2 days of cash before they couldn&#x27;t continue operations.  We came really, really close to having the entire world stop working!<p>Andrew Ross Sorkin has a great book called Too Big to Fail that goes into this.  House of Cards is also a great book on the 2008 crash.<p>The other big firm to go under in 2008 was Bear Sterns.  If you like finance read &quot;When Genius Failed&quot; its the history of the rise and fall of Long Term Capital Management.  In the book they detail how everyone except for Bear Sterns pitches in to bail out the fund.  In 2008 Bear Sterns was the one who needed the bail out and the same people who pleaded with Bear to help with the LTCM bailout just turned their bask of Bear and let them go bankrupt and then get bought for $172 a share at the end of 2006 to being bought for $2 a share in 2008.",1444140551

If I&#x27;m working on a project with someone, I can immediately find them and message them without worrying that it&#x27;s some random imposter or some such.<p>This sounds like <i>a little inconvenience</i>. Hypothetical, at that. I use email and at least half my contacts have some made-up username that doesn&#x27;t relate to their real identity. It works very well. I&#x27;m not so familiar with Skype, but how do &quot;fake friend requests&quot; work on Twitter? You decide who to follow, and that&#x27;s it. The list of followers is not a very useful source of info and never was, even without bots, you can&#x27;t know if that old friend in your followers list even uses Twitter regularly.<p>But the real question is, I don&#x27;t believe for a moment that <i>(the possibility of) a little inconvenience</i> should in any way weigh in against the certainty of real physical danger <i>that is happening right now</i> to (I don&#x27;t have the numbers but I&#x27;m sure it has to be at least) 1000s of individuals.

Are they <i>of necessity</i> completely isolated units deployed with Docker and Kubernates on a CoreOS cluster and communicating only via HTTP each with independent databases?  Yes this seems a bit much for most projects.<p>There are midway options though.  Even the lowly batch job is a good way to get some of the decoupling without having to go &quot;all-in&quot;.  I find batch jobs and message queues give me 80% of the benefit of &quot;microservices&quot; with only 5% of the pain.<p>In fact someone needs to write an article on &quot;levels&quot; of &quot;microserviceness&quot;, (which certainly has multiple dimensions and branches) and point out the benefits and drawbacks of each level.<p>Of course the end game being: &quot;a Docker container for each line of code.&quot;",1444140075

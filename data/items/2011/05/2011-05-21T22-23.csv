It's pretty decent by itself.<p>However, the logical extension is iTunes U which is devoid of any real support, except via a forum, and an email system which sends out the dumbest canned responses I've ever read.<p>I tried for several weeks to get iTunes U set up properly, and no amount of expensive deluxe enterprise support could do the job. Even on a priority ticket, Apple techs and my sales rep told me repeatedly, ""Uh, support for that is via email only.""<p>And then the canned email responses were utterly Kafka-esque, as in, ""Oh gee, did you break your iPod? Did you lose a file on your hard drive?""  When I called in desperation to their iTunes support (as they instructed in the email), they could not get past their own support screen which demanded a product serial number.  For iTunes U?  No serial number, no service, next!  Thank you, come again!<p>I'm an enterprise customer. Or was.<p>The rest of Apple enterprise support is solid, but if you're just setting up iTunes U in 2011, it's a ghetto. It's so bad that after months of training, evaluation, vendor selection etc., after investing tens of thousands in Apple hardware, software, training and enterprise support, we killed the project because the iTunes U part was just brain-dead support-wise.<p>That, and we started to feel like we were just shilling for Apple's proprietary stack, paying for the privilege, and then getting the insult of hearing ""there's an app for that.""  Yeah, but where's the support?  We paid a lot to find out it doesn't exist for iTunes U.<p>So that's why I'm a tad disillusioned about enterprise Apple.

2571952,comment,2571742,2571742,3,0,PaulHoule,,,"For CRUD and other common business apps I think you can be more productive developing web apps than you can be developing native apps.<p>It happened without people being conscious of it,  and enterprise 'architects' are always trying to undo it,  but the standard model webapp that has a stateless front end that keeps all persistent information in a database has a number of advantages over the 'tangle of pointers' architecture that native apps have.  'tangle of pointers' applications inevitable have failures of memory management that,  like cancer,  will take the application down if it runs long enough.  Even if you don't think about it,  webapps force you to have an engineered application state.<p>There certainly isn't anything like Visual Basic for the web but Ruby on Rails and all of the modern frameworks that imitate it make it easy to pound CRUD apps out fast.<p>If you want to do something that doesn't fit into the CRUD model,  if you feel like you need a fancy interface,  or if you do AJAX for the sake of AJAX,  then you might be more productive writing native apps.<p>AJAX for AJAX sake is a particularly serious web antipattern.  I must admit I take delight when my competitors develop AJAX-heavy web sites that are like Romulan Cloaking Devices so far as Google is concerned.  I get free traffic from search engines and they get nothing...  Even though they're smart people who've worked even harder than I have.<p>To be fair,  there are answers to the AJAX 'complexity barrier' that people run into because of the difficulty of choreographing asynchronous communications.  Unfortunately nobody has written much about them because those of us who could are either busy doing it or have reached the conclusion that front-end development is lame.",1306017855

My second course was focused around an extension of the previous semester's project. The data-set became more complicated, we added a GUI, and we had to be able to write intermediate results out to a file, and read them back in. We were introduced to pointers and dynamic memory, and we got our first taste of data structures by implementing a linked list and having to sort it. The final program was 4,000 lines. Near the end, we were introduced to the basics of OO design - no inheritance or polymorphism, but we were supposed to take our data structures and associated functions and organize them into classes. In that way, we were able to see that some OO programming was just a more organized way of doing what we were already doing.<p>The emphasis of the second course was introducing us to data structures, basic algorithmic analysis, and making us program <i>a lot</i>.

The original context the writer is most certainly French where actuel means current, however the usage generates a false cognate.",1306015332

Here is why I think:<p><pre><code>   1. Even though it is sold for $200 million+ they were still NOT using the Amazon multiple zones feature of Amazon. Below is the link how SmugMug survived amazon crash by using Amazon's multiple zones feature. http://don.blogs.smugmug.com/2011/04/24/how-smugmug-survived-the-amazonpocalypse/
   2. No phone contact support in the event of issues (not application but Heroku's), lot to learn from Rackspace
   3. The application I am hosting, people will starve if it goes down for few hours on Friday forget about 60 hours downtime.
   4. I see intermittent deployment and connectivity issues. Please visit this link for a confirmation: http://status.heroku.com/
</code></pre>
I know developers love it because they throw a cheap web process called 'dyno' for free.<p>What do you think?",1306015296

Or, are you actually fixing things when they go down?<p>All my major providers (Rackspace, SoftLayer and EngineYard) provide good monitoring and 2 of them (RS and EY) usually fix things before I even have a chance to take a look.<p>With SoftLayer and some of my Linode VPSs, I'd be willing to pay for monitoring+resolution. I travel a lot so it would be cool if I got a text message like ""Server 3 is not responding to HTTP requests. Reply with Y if you'd like us to investigate."" ... that way I have the option of looking myself or having you look.<p>That's probably more service work than you want to do, but I think there's a need for ""managed"" work like that with so many cloud/VPS providers around.",1306015265

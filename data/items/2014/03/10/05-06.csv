Vietnam is the prime example.<p>The problem is that historically the US doesn&#x27;t do well in long term, large scale unconventional warfare, especially if it isn&#x27;t conducted on open terrain. Even if SOCOM runs the show now, overall the strategy is still highly conventional.<p>Capturing Afghanistan is easy. Holding it every year is the true test.<p>The humiliation from Vietnam has improved our forces as a whole. However, the problem remains. How do you fight an enemy with little to no infrastructure? How do you fight an enemy with no real fixed base of operations or even command? Maybe the US does know how to win the war now. Winning hearts and minds of the occupied is the key. Unfortunately, knowing how to win and executing a win are two very different things.",1394431125

That&#x27;s the only answer. Don&#x27;t roll your own! Especially don&#x27;t roll your own when you don&#x27;t have a solid security background. You have obviously heard some of the right terms, but how and where you can apply them is at least as important as using them at all.<p>1. Doesn&#x27;t protect anything at all. Hash functions don&#x27;t do anything when people have access to the program code. No matter how fancy you go with time limited hashes (and there are smarter ways to create those). At most it adds a few minutes to the reverse engineering.<p>2. Again, this doesn&#x27;t protect against anything. HTTPS stops intercepts on the wire, not someone who has access to your app, people can still lift the secret keys and the hashing scheme from the app binary.<p>3.& 4. Both true, and would protect against mass stealing of the passwords like happened here, but it wouldn&#x27;t prevent abuse of the API.<p>There are very many people who use techniques like the ones you suggest in 1. and 2. and the same very many people have vulnerable apps that usually expose all users&#x27; data to the world. There are a lot of apps that store e.g. user files or some sort of configuration not on a per user OAuth protected storage like OneDrive, DropBox or Google Drive, but either there but on just the account of the developer, or on another storage that is only authenticated with the developer&#x27;s credentials. People who do that allow anyone to read and modify the data of all users, exactly the same as people are allowed to do to their own data, or more if the credentials aren&#x27;t properly limited, even if it&#x27;s blocked in the app.",1394431091

They can pay to avoid that grind.  Worse artificial delays are often built in and an IAP is provided to circumvent that artificial delay.  Using our hypothetical race game as an example there might be a supply of tyres.  Each time you enter a race you use four tyres. Tyres are replenished at a rate of one every hour, unless you&#x27;ve paid for an IAP - &quot;tyre factory upgrade: never run out of tyres - $Y&quot;.<p>EDIT: plenty of people have bad memories of collectible card games and talk of feeling manipulated and exploited and addicted.",1394430947

7371468,story,,,5,9,cdcarter,"Ask HN: The software I want to build is too custom, how do I make it affordable?",,"Lately I&#x27;ve been working on a software package for non-profit arts organizations to help them manage and evaluate the work that is submitted to them, and review it in a timely manner. This kind of system exists at lots of organizations on notepads on common clipboards, spreadsheets, or if the organization really has it together, an Access database.<p>The core of the software is ultimately pretty simple, however it really needs to be custom tailored to each organization. Some groups want to track whether artists are persons of color, some groups want to have explicit fields for evaluating, and some just want space for a recommendation and a way to attach an in depth review, and every organization believes that theirs is the one true method. These changes are all pretty simple to make, however they are large enough and sometimes architectural enough to make building one monster app and database with support for all the iterations rather imposing. Especially when I can&#x27;t afford to work on this full time.<p>It seems like the best option for me, and for each of my customers, is to build a custom instance for each organization. That way they can truly get the interface they want. And I think organizations are willing to pay for that customization time! But they aren&#x27;t willing to pay $40 a month for two dynos on Heroku or other comparable Rails hosting. Even $30 a month for a solid VPS (and then more time for the setup...) seems like a lot of money to organizations that are having to cut work weeks and personnel, for something they already have a sort of reasonable system.<p>Do I try to make one monster app that can serve every organization, risking complexity, less flexibility, and security? Do I just try and optimize and optimize until it can run happily on a less beefy machine? Or do I have too many pre-conceived notions about how customers think, and I just need to pump out a project, set a price, and start going? Help!",1394430530

Fundraising in the manner you suggest would give you the money of an angel round (or less) + the loss of control of an IPO.<p>Many startups severely regret going IPO, because (unless you carefully manage the process a la Facebook or Google) you immediately cede a great degree of control to the shareholders.<p>In this case, the <i>only</i> benefit to the founders (assuming their coins aren&#x27;t invalidated) is monetary, while the <i>costs</i> are manifest. I think the pre-mined allocation will be competed out of existence, as it adds no value to the process and because as long as the currency gets adopted, the founding developers (like Satoshi and the early bitcoin devs) will still benefit greatly.<p>Basically I can see very few benefits to the startup&#x27;s founders for going this route vs normal fundraising. Democracy may be the least worst form of governance for a nation-state, but the point of a (good) nation-state is to preserve liberty, not to realize a particular vision (unless that vision <i>is</i> liberty or in the case of bitcoin, <i>is</i> the currency itself).*<p>What could work in the manner suggested is more akin to an autonomous, non-profit corporation. (Yes, individuals can profit by being early adopters or providing value-add services, but the corporation itself is self-perpetuating and not-for-profit).<p>I&#x27;m not saying such autonomous corporations shouldn&#x27;t be built, of course they should be if they fill a need (just like non-profits). I just don&#x27;t see this as a viable alternative to fundraising for a for-profit startup.<p>* There are of course several examples to the contrary (of a &quot;vision&quot; being achieved in such a manner).

I am, intimately so, and the difference is <i>huge</i>. It&#x27;s absolutely crazily different. St. Louis is dirt cheap compared to San Francisco. SF housing is most certainly well more than twice as expensive.<p>Also, I think your salary gap isn&#x27;t necessarily representative of the norm. $75k is closer to starting salary in many medium-COL cities, and $150k is definitely not the starting salary for the vast majority of developers in San Francisco. Most start at something like $100k, which is actually borderline worse than $75k in certain cheaper areas (especially those without state income taxes, like Texas).<p>All that said, I agree that one should probably take $150k in SF over $75k in St. Louis. I just disagree with the nuances of your post, based on experience.",1394427646

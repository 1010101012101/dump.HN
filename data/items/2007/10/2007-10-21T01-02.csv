I have had success with RH and CentOS. <p>My suggestion: get VMWare Player and play with a bunch of them for fun. Kind of inefficient, but it's cool if you like that sort of thing.",1192930947

Eventually with both project a proven failure in the market, he jumped ship to Raskin and took over the Mac project. <p>NeXT was a dismal failure. The product was too expensive for its market, it sold little in its market. They made NeXTStep, true, but due to a bit of Gassee's inability to market it properly, BeOS lost out despite how many internally wanted it instead. <p>All that said though, no, I don't think it's Steve's luck that's gotten him to where he is. His ability I believe is in leadership, vision, and strategy. Having seen him in action, I think his greatest asset is his ability to effect others. He makes them better, he knows what he wants immediately and has the strategic vision to see it through. His ability to get certain products right has propelled him higher and higher into upper management. Now that he's the CEO his vision only elevates and pushes more product out the door. The chicken and egg problem for others emulate though is: how do you get into a position of power, or, how do you push out people to push out the right product? <p>As for Marine boot camp and the subsequent combat tours, I can tell you without a doubt FMJ, nor any other movie, even come close.",1192929385

He can't build whatever it is himself, but he can choose among all the options unerringly, and get his choices built. He's like a really effective patron of the arts.",1192929011

70784,comment,70746,70772,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I suppose it is <i>possible</i> that Steve Jobs is the Forrest Gump of technology: for thirty years, he has just happened to be standing next to the biggest innovators in consumer technology. I've never met Steve, and Apple doesn't leak many rumors, so it's hard for me to know.<p>But if Steve's secret is being in the right place at the right time, he sure has a knack for finding that place. First the Apple II. Then the Mac. Then NeXT (which, once rebranded as ""Mac OS X"", finally became a huge success). Pixar. The iPod. The iPhone.<p>I think Steve Jobs is more than merely lucky.<p>And the fact that so many of the engineers who worked for  Jobs are famous is evidence of his management skill. I've heard it said that the job of a good manager is to hire the best engineers and then get out of their way. You have to relentlessly clear all obstacles from their path, give them whatever they need to do great work (which includes holding them to high standards) and constantly promote them and their work, both inside and outside the company.<p>I'm not saying that Steve Jobs is necessarily the perfect manager. I often wonder whether I would enjoy working for him. (Just as, when I watch a movie like <i>Full Metal Jacket</i>, I wonder whether I would survive basic training.) But you can't argue with the results: people who work with Steve Jobs become geek legends. Woz. Raskin. Hertzfeld. Atkinson. Ive.

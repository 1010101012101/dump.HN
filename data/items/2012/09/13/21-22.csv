I think this is more useful for sharing business logic code between Android, iOS, and web (via GWT) apps without re-writes in Objective-C and JavaScript.  Keep the respective presentation logic in ObjC+Interface Builder, JS+CSS, etc.  I'm not sold on the idea of developing iOS apps alone in Java since the Apple tools are so good.",1347573575
4518870,comment,4518412,4518826,7,0,desbest,,,"The difference between Quora and Facebook, is that me and my friends can upload photos of ourselves drunk and post wall posts of us swearing, and Facebook will be always a good product to the entire community despite this.<p>With Quora, the community isn't tied down to who you are friends with. There are no friend requests. On Quora, everyone is technically your ""friend"".<p>So with that said, it is not just enough to allow people to behave as bad as they want on Quora. If that happened, people would leave in disgust. If I was posting racist things on Facebook, only my friends would know and you would still be using Facebook regardless. On Quora it's not like that.",1347573553

Nothing I've seen since has changed that basic option.  (But wow, the technologies that I thought would go somewhere.  It is humbling to see how wrong I was.  But the points are still good.)<p>Now years later consider carefully that the ""failure"" that Joel criticized is what lead to Mozilla, Firefox, and the second browser wars.  Furthermore consider that Netscape had no real choice with its rewrite.  As a company they were going to die.  Hence their effort to open source the code.  But they didn't have licenses to everything in their browser, therefore the open source version <i>couldn't even run!</i><p>Now I'll grant that the decision to rewrite working production code is always to be undertaken carefully.  It can easily go wrong.  But in this case Dropbox decided to do it, they've done it, they've had no ill consequences (the lack of consequences is not an accident - they knew how to do it well), and they are more than satisfied with the result.

Complete lack of documentation for syntax. Because there are basically no more braces and parentheses, CoffeeScript just tries to guess what you're doing, as far as I can tell, based on a bunch of internal heuristics. Unfortunately, there's no way for me to learn how to write parseable code without constantly pasting into the coffeescript.org site, and seeing if CoffeeScript understands it or not. This is the first language I've ever used where the syntax rules are essentially unknowable, and a lot of time gets wasted trying to discover them through trial and error.<p>2. Unexpected side effects. For example, functions return the last evaluated value by default. If you're using $.each(), and your function's last line is something that returns false (like a separate function you call), then your $.each() loop will terminate unexpectedly early, since jQuery does that when it receives a false. So CoffeeScript isn't just a wrapper around JavaScript, but it really changes its behavior. Another example: CoffeeScript gets rid of function hoisting. A significant JavaScript feature, completely gone.<p>I personally am slower to code in CoffeeScript, because I know JavaScript 100% inside and out, but with CoffeeScript that isn't really possible, because so much of its implementation is undocumented. I mean, many times you're forced to end a line with a backslash in order to continue it, and even the existence of that necessary feature isn't mentioned once in the docs.<p>But a lot of people seem to love the syntax, and that seems to outweigh the negatives for them. I personally don't find JavaScript that ugly, but coding in a language I can't ever fully understand gives me a huge headache.",1347572345

CoffeeScript significantly reduces the number of lines of code in a project and therefore the number of defects.<p>CoffeeScript is cleaner and easier to read, which is better software engineering.  CoffeeScript solves many of the issues with JavaScript.  The fewer warts and plumbing people have to deal with related to the language, the more they can focus on the actual problems they wanted to solve.<p>This is a little bit like the architectural decision to program user applications in languages and platforms with garbage collection and built-in frameworks rather than using a language like C or C++ with manual memory management and minimal standard libraries.  Sure you get less control over the lower-level details such as allocation and deallocation of memory, but those lower level details actually are distracting from the application domain and were actually repetitive and could be automated.  So the best way to solve those problems is to move to a platform that abstracts them away or handles them for you.<p>The reason that developers don't like CoffeeScript (other than the fact that they haven't learned it yet, and don't want to take the time) is simple, psychological rather than logical, and its the same reason that they don't like platforms like the ones I was talking about above: it makes things significantly easier, and that is problematic psychologically for programmers for two reasons:<p>1) The whole point of being a programmer is that you are mastering complex ASCII codes that other people can't decipher.  Making things less complex takes away part of your identity as a programmer (not for everyone obviously, but for many).<p>2) Many programmers instinctively and falsely believe that any system which makes their job significantly easier must automatically come with compensatory trade-offs in things like performance or flexibility.  This is intuitive, but false.<p>CoffeeScript improvements: indenting two spaces and using -> plus no closing parens and curly braces makes nested callbacks much easier to read and write, fat arrow binds this making it easier to use classes, class and extends provide a standard, simple way to create and extend classes, iterating over arrays and objects is much easier and cleaner, control flow and function definition is cleaner, better variable scoping, simplified closer wrapper in loops, more straightforward boolean operators, existential operator for cleanly and simply checking for variable existence.<p>Thought of one other explanation for not liking CoffeeScript: plain old status quo bias.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias</a>",1347571871

I put off CoffeeScript for ages, because nothing was wrong with my JS code.  ""Besides,"" I thought, ""CoffeeScript compiles to JS, it can't do anything JS can't do.""<p>And that is true.  Nothing is exactly wrong with JS.  In fact many things are great about JS, which is how we end up with ClojureScript and CoffeeScript and x86 emulators.  JS is very powerful -- maybe too powerful.  There are a million ways to accomplish the same task, which means that <i>during an initial look at a new JS codebase, the program flow is not obvious.</i><p>Some developers hate semicolons, some always put commas at the end of the line and some at the beginning, some always use braces and some don't use braces with single-line statements.  One can never be sure where a statement ends, or what constitutes a code block, unless one hunts down all the trailing braces, parentheses, and semicolons.  I'm not even going to mention all the possible inheritance patterns.<p>CoffeeScript is not nearly as flexible in syntax.  There is one way to make a code block, one inheritance method.  It doesn't need semicolons, braces, or parentheses because of its strict style.  Therefore there is less to think about.  There is less to go wrong.  No one needs to use a CoffeeScriptLint, because CoffeeScript is not full of non-obvious 'gotchas'.<p>CoffeeScript code is more concise and more intuitive, because it reads more like an English sentence.  When I read another developer's CoffeeScript I can begin understanding the meaning instantly, rather than having to spend time determining the structure and programming technique.  List comprehensions, ranges, and other functional programming tools simply don't exist in pure JavaScript -- the JS equivalent is much more verbose and much less obvious.  CoffeeScript encourages creating small flexible code blocks, which together make a powerful structure.  This all leads to fewer opportunities for bugs to appear.<p>The only thing I don't like about CoffeeScript, is that I didn't keep an open mind and start using it sooner.  I think anyone who considers themselves a serious JS developer should give CoffeeScript a try.  It's a much more relaxing, simple way to write powerful JS.<p><i>(Credit goes to Spine.js switching to CoffeeScript to finally push me into it.)</i><p>EDIT: Of course it is possible to write ambiguous, unclear code in any language.  CoffeeScript is an opportunity to let go of old habits and find a fresh perspective on problem-solving:  Maybe there is a better way to do things.   (I had to let go of semicolons!)<p>CoffeeScript's functional programming style <i>has changed the way I approach programming.</i> My code is now more robust and less complicated.  Less bugs and less keystrokes mean I ship faster.  CoffeeScript is a better language because it's a tool which makes me a better developer.",1347571518

It also uses 3 cores during startup processing<p>The difference between JavaScript and C++ is less than one order of magnitude, and note that this is a hard case to optimize for JS engines since LLVM inlining creates huge functions that JS engines just give up on optimizing currently. So that the game ends up still running as fast as it does in JS is a nice surprise.<p>There are also lots of other compiled examples of real-world code, like Box2D and Bullet.

Originally I thought I noticed improvement, but only realized I was looking for improvement in every task I did, which made me notice everything I did.  After this realization I didn't notice anything at all, for the rest of my supplies.  I learned more than just their ineffectiveness during this self experiment...<p>EDIT:\nI will revise my statement to add that I do not think that *racetams are completely ineffective.

Lets look at what is going on here.<p>The US government is funding education that is tailored to focus on their topics of interest.  These students then spend 2 years working for the government getting more education and experience.<p>At this point, (a) is remedied by leaving government positions for better paid contractor ones (I think the US government / contractor relationship is greatly misunderstood in general) or feeding off into private industry.  If you read through several bios of people in the industry you find ties to DoD and intel agencies all over the place (some are as contractors).  But the idea here is (in my opinion), the government isn't concerned about who is on their payroll, but rather they have more capable professionals trained for this type of work in the country.  People whose skills they can pay for one way or another.<p>I think a lot of people misunderstand the requirements of (b).  And those that can't qualify for top clearances can be fed as ""infosec engineers"" into other agencies where a secret clearance is all that is required (FAA for example).  Again, just having more trained people spread about is the goal here.<p>Additionally, contractors can conduct work in non-classified environments with non-cleared personnel in some situations and/or you have more distant relationships.  Think vulnerability selling / purchasing.<p>As for (c), it is often hard to tie someone's direct work to some mandate.  Where do you draw the line? Not working in a specific group? Specific agency? Contractor? Supplier?  At some level, Microsoft is supporting the work NSA does.  Different people draw different lines at different places.",1347570285

Even more direct subsidies to the bankers who own ""your"" house, so they can continue their charade of overinflated home prices and demanding hefty rent simply for a place to <i>exist</i>. Never mind that you're still responsible for the maintenance, and probably have not the knowledge nor time to do it yourself, as you're too busy working to service your indentured servant mouse wheel.<p>I just don't get what keeps most people complaining about one or two narrow pieces of the puzzle, but yet completely accepting of the entire perverted ball of wax of over-abstracted, hollowed out, and corrupt institutions. This mild dissent is then amazingly converted into <i>support</i> every time an election roles around, where the socially acceptable thing is to cheer on your chosen republocrat, pretending that electing new faces will change anything (not that a third party would magically fix things either, it's just a minimum viable dissent). Is it just straightforward cognitive dissonance because of how painful it would be to admit most things you take for granted are simply not there? Is it that most people smart enough to actually see how rigged the game are still able to achieve an ""above average"" place in society and thus aren't interested in meta questions ?

If anyone needs to learn more, send me a mail from my profile, will be happy to tell you what I know. (disclaimer: I don't get paid by vpsfarm for these stmt).",1237978775

There's some pretty fun stuff going on under the covers.  I'll give three quick examples..<p>1) Xobni's data store sits strictly underneath the sidebar code in the stack.  It was originally built to support Xobni Analytics, our first product from 2006 that bombed.  Fortunately we got to leverage the same data store when creating the Xobni sidebar.<p>It's very cool.  When someone is building software leveraging our backend, say the sidebar, or the Invite Your Friends feature, the code ends up looking like this:<p><pre><code>  foreach(var mail in new MailIterator()) {
    Console.WriteLine(mail.Subject);
  }
</code></pre>
This code will print 10k subjects per second, from disk!  And it's from a key-value store, so it's easy to add new data fields and types.<p>2) Not only that, but the data store is built to be client agnostic above ""layer 1"" where we interface with the mail client.  So when we wanted to integrate Yahoo Mail all we had to do was build the adapter piece that knew how to speak Yahoo's language, and suddenly the mail floats all the way up the stack and appears in the sidebar right next to Outlook emails.  :-)<p>3) The areas where we display information from Facebook, LinkedIn, etc are all little embedded instances of Internet Explorer.  The code for those extensions is all just HTML and Javascript.  When the user changes the current email we invoke a specific JS function called updatePerson(), and there's a callback object the JS can use to make HTTP calls and write lines to the log file.  This architecture, which was invented by someone smarter than me, allows us to pump these babies out quickly and without much QA risk to the other parts of the program.<p>It just doesn't get any cooler than this!!!!<p>(Commercial: if you're a developer and are interested in being part of the team, send your resume to jobs@xobni.com!)",1237978574

Possibly I've just used git enough by now -- albeit not intensively -- that it was easy to follow, but I completely agree with his contention that you have to understand the repository format to understand git, and he does a good job of of covering that in context.<p>Scott Chacon's gitcasts included a keynote he gave which also has a good explanation of the repository and how it works: <a href=""http://www.gitcasts.com/posts/railsconf-git-talk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gitcasts.com/posts/railsconf-git-talk</a>.  He has a peepcode book covering the same material, which I bought out of appreciation for gitcasts at the time.",1237978088

531674,comment,531671,531671,0,0,sgrove,,,"I think a lot of the points are good, but the wording is dangerously wrong on some:<p>""Wrong: Find people to work for your for free and let them do as they please | Right: Selectively recruit people to work on your team for free and tell them exactly what they should be doing""<p>Yes, you have to find the right people. Even those working for free might be too expensive if they hurt your overall progress. And their interests have to be perfectly aligned with yours, so that even when left alone they produce good, useful results. But this comes off a bit as permission to micromanage, which would kill any normal hacker.<p>The emphasis on results is well placed though - in my experience, people crossing over into startup life don't always realize that ""hours worked"" doesn't equate to anything really useful. It all comes down to the progress made. Big companies can afford to estimate the average production per hour for a given employee and pay appropriately, and then take some time to see if it works out. Startups don't financially or strategically have that kind of leeway for key employees.",1237976083

The 3M projector used in this demo was made available only a year ago, but several phone makers have already started making projector phones. The next step is simply to add a mirror to the projector, attach a string so it can hang around the neck and start write some software for it.<p>It probably won't be as hugely successful as the iPhone, but for many users it will be very useful.",1237975381

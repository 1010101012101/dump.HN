8856934,comment,8856683,8856683,0,0,rmcastil,,,"A lot of salary negotiation and asking comes down to preparation.<p>It&#x27;s terrifying to ask for one the first time but it&#x27;s a natural part of employment. The basic principal behind hiring an employee is that they will become a financial net positive for the business eventually.<p>As an employee you can figure out how you affect the bottom line. It may take some imagination but you can come up with a ball park figure. In a larger corporation this may be a little tougher but with some digging you can come up with an idea whether you&#x27;ve become a net positive.<p>At the point you&#x27;ve become a net positive everything you make the company beyond your salary goes to profit or your bonus. If you&#x27;re really good at your job then a lot of it is going to be going to profit. This is the point where you should ask for a raise.<p>Again it will be nerve racking but if you go in knowing how you affect the business&#x27;s bottom line your raise will be justified.<p>I&#x27;d also suggest walking in with knowledge regarding how much people with similar job responsibilities make. This can be found on salary look up sites. A quick google search pointed me out to payscale.com and indeed.com",1420732793

Even if she was removed, it wouldn&#x27;t prevent the same sort of thing happening again.<p>Targeting the individual is crucial.<p>Carmen Ortiz has already done significant damage to her career over this. She hasn&#x27;t been fired (yet), but in all likelihood she is never going to rise above her current position. She&#x27;s damaged goods. That&#x27;s a good thing.<p>Any future prosecutor is already likely to approach a similar case with trepidation instead as they weigh up the risks of the public backlash vs. the possibility of making some powerful friends. That&#x27;s a (small) measure of success.<p>>Let&#x27;s not make it about one prosecutor.<p>To be honest, this is probably the lever that is most likely to achieve results. Indeed, it probably already has. Muted grumbling about &#x27;the system&#x27; does not achieve results anywhere close to making a powerful individual fearful of a ruined reputation.",1420732788

We do all of our work in Java, which is definitely not a great candidate for real-time in most cases, so a lot of what I&#x27;ve learned about real-time programming has come from having to wrangle the JVM in to doing what we need it to do.<p>The fields that come to mind when I think of real-time outside of HFT, though, are control systems and digital signal processing (DSP).  While DSP doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to be real-time if you&#x27;re doing it for analysis, doing DSP live definitely requires real-time programming knowledge since signals are often expressed in the time domain and any delay in computation of a discrete element will propagate in how the signal is interpreted. For example, if the signal you&#x27;re processing is a sound signal (like music), and you are doing software-based DSP on the signal before it reaches the playback device, it better be real-time or any delay spikes will ruin the playback.  This is why OS X is so popular with the music industry and especially DJ&#x27;s; the Mach kernel has really good real-time support and a pretty good real-time software based DSP library for building apps.",1420732086

SHA was slow, open source SHA implementations were rare at the time, crypto had a stigma due to export restrictions, and was generally problematic to work with due to limited hardware support and speed.<p>Second, several different implementations were needed and they needed to be different enough that a simple pattern search would not find them all. SHA implementations LOOK a lot like SHA implementations in the disassembly, and it&#x27;s hard to modify them in a way that leaves them functional but different enough that the compiler doesn&#x27;t optimize away differences. A CRC is simple enough that you can do things like that.<p>Third, these things were all over the code, and run frequently. They couldn&#x27;t just set a global flag and be done with it. They had to be fast. I am not sure, but I think the Playstation had hardware CRC support, but no hardware SHA support.<p>It&#x27;s amazing that we now live in a world where you wouldn&#x27;t think twice about using a cryptographically secure algorithm for data you don&#x27;t actually need to hide (just obfuscate for a month or two) and not have any concern about performance.<p>Incidentally, if you&#x27;re interested in an application of essentially every known antidebugging and antimodification technique known at the time in the same binary, have a look at <a href=""https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-europe-06/bh-eu-06-biondi/bh-eu-06-biondi-up.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-europe-06/bh-eu-06...</a>",1420732028

Never thought of it under that angle.<p>To me, Instagram is the culmination of photography, making shooting and editing available to truly everyone. When photography first appeared, it was this slow, clunky, expensive process that required extreme knowledge of the tools to produce anything. Over time, it got easier - we went from daguerreotypes to self-contained camera, to portable cameras that still required fiddling with settings, to portable cameras that could take shots in almost any conditions, to instant cameras, to digital cameras that still require effort to share the picture, to digital cameras that can share the picture instantly to the entire world.<p>And in counterpart to that, the editing process has gotten simpler too: we went from needing to know the chemicals of photography, to bringing your film at your local store, to tools like Photoshop (that allowed you to crop, adjust colors etc. but still required knowledge to do so), to Instagram: where there&#x27;s no manual to read, and an instant a 12 year old teenager or a 75 year old grandparent can crop, retouch, color balance, etc. their photos.<p>Sure, the purist might argue that Instagram filters are not the same as balancing your chemicals yourself, blablabla - but look at the end result: people are able to take ownership of photography in ways that were impossible to in 1840. Ultimately, photography, like any form of expression, is as much about the tools that enable it as the people it reaches.<p>Because Instagram (and other mobile photography apps of course, but Instagram is kind of the figure head) have put photography in the hands of everyone, I think they&#x27;ve really brought the medium to its best form.<p>(my views on this topic are mostly informed by the book &quot;L&#x27;Image Sans Qualités&quot;, sadly only available in French, and conversations with my uncle, a hardcore photographer who develops his own pictures and builds (!) his own cameras from scratch, also sadly only available in French)",1420731247

In fact, to the contrary, I have observed poor leadership as the greatest mitigable contributor to failure.<p>This article, in my opinion, is a bunch of feel-good management bullshit about workaholics and culture fit.

Swartz faced nothing resembling 35 years, because federal sentencing does not work by simply adding the counts up for every charged offense. Like charges &quot;group&quot;, and the convicted are sentenced according to the most severe of those charges.<p>The prosecutors threatened Swartz not with 35 years, but with ~7. 7 years is also a ludicrous sentence. But it was also an unrealistic sentence: under the sentencing guidelines, Swartz was likely to face (if convicted) a sentence denominated in months not years, and --- according to his own lawyer, and observable from the actual sentencing guidelines --- one that probably could have made the probation cutoff to avoid any custodial time.<p>So, your third bulleted suggestion isn&#x27;t valid: CFAA crimes are already not sentenced &quot;consecutively&quot;.<p>What seems clear now is that the prosecutors were determined to have Swartz sentenced for some amount of prison time (they offered a plea deal with a very short sentence, and rejected any deals that failed to put Swartz in prison at all). <i>That</i> is a problem. The first half of your comment captures it.

It is typical that there is a smaller ARM bootstrap core on the SoC that does the early boot process and kicks up the actual (bigger) ARM core(s) and then hands over control to a bootloader (like u-boot) or boots the OS using a device-specific bootstrap code.<p>In other words: it would <i>not</i> be fun to do this using a RasPi (depending on your definition of &quot;fun&quot; of course). You would be spending lots of time with scarce documentation, dealing with practically no debugging aids and the only way to know if your code is working is whether a LED lights up and no way to debug failures. If you had a development board, perhaps you&#x27;d have JTAG or other debugging means available but I&#x27;m not sure if you can find this on a RasPi.

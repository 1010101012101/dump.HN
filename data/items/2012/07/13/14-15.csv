(So each tester would generate its own ""correct"" images.)  Yes, it is possible that some of the images this other tester assumes are correct aren't actually correct on their machine due to the hardware configuration.  But if you care about this, you would not be able to share test results, anyway.  And you could still test actual rendering on different kinds of hardware in a separate pass.",1342191526

Could anyone provide some pointers, please?<p>> I'm talking about modal editing. Obviously I'm not against context.<p>When scientific proof lacks, appropriate analogies can be our only tool in analyzing a issue and reaching a conclusion. My point is that people don't seem to have issues with modality in other contexts, provided that they know how to cope with it, thus why should I doubt their ability to cope with modality while editing?<p>> This isn't how we progress. Do you have a study that demonstrates the opposite? Then claiming the study was flawed is meaningless.<p>Sadly, progress is slower than we wish. If a study contradicting empirical evidence is flawed, it doesn't prove anything, for empirical evidence wins and we are back to square one.<p>> I knew how to use it just fine, but mode management slows everything down.<p>This proves that some people have issues with modal editing. Why? Maybe:\n- they didn't approach it effectively (in the case of Vim, they lingered in Insert mode);\n- their tools were inappropriate (in the case of Vim, the Esc key was too far).\n- or modal editing requires some mental capability which not everyone possess (some people can type on Dvorak and Qwerty, indifferently);\n- or modal thinking is a learned skill;\n- or...\nIf we can solve this problem, instead of saying that modal editing is better, we could say that modal editing is better when some conditions are met.<p>EDIT: I've also thought about reasons for Vi-style editing not being as superior as it was in the past:\n- keyboard layouts do not resemble the keyboard layout used while designing Vi;\n- keyboards with integrated touch-pads and/or track-pads are available to make switching to a pointing device quicker.",1342191302

The board will have to be redesigned to fit into a new form factor and accommodate new peripherals. This will take significant time and effort, regardless of whether the engineering is done in the US, China, or Zimbabwe.<p>> Thirdly, it's interesting that you have both insight into the margins of several different hardware manufacturers and also into the internal R&D discussions of Ouya to know that they are going to end up selling a $200 Tegra2 instead of a $99 Tegra3 device. Gosh, they should've just hired you, no?<p>This is just silly. I point out a system <i>on the market</i> with much closer specs to what Ouya is trying to accomplish (no screen, similar outputs, etc) and point out that's still twice their price point.

4240029,comment,4238984,4239564,21,0,ballooney,,,"I rather agree with this. I love that there exists one person with a lot of cash, and technical chops, and the right attitude. That's rare and powerful. But as someone fairly familiar with the space industry I do see a lot of gushing nonsense on HN whenever SpaceX comes up, about how [rocket feature xyz] 'could never' be invented by a government agency when infact in several such cases of drunk-on-koolaid the [rocket feature xyz] isn't new and specifically was invented by NASA or the russians in the 60s. Or similar. Once or twice I've tried to correct these comments [1] but I usually don't as it just feels like pissing into the wind. SpaceX more or less got what was left of the FASTRAC engine[2] work given to them by Nasa as a starting point. Infact, the turbopumps in SpaceX's merlin engines, which most rocket engineers will tell you is the hardest bit to design in a rocket engine, are built by someone else (Barber Nichols), who also made the one for FASTRAC [3].<p>But this isn't a criticism - it's precisely what they should be doing and what I would do in the same situation! It would be madness not to start from a known working configuration (designing a rocket engine is a massive game of high dimensional parameter whack-a-mole, it's very difficult to get a passable configuration without a lot of iteration and forwards-backwards passes). They're trying to massively lower the cost of space access, and you don't do that by trying to redevelop everything from first principles. It's bloody clever to learn everything you can from people in Nasa who are willing to help you and are pissed off that their own beaurocracy won't let them do it themselves. But it's a far cry from the narrative that people on this site sometimes try and suggest, which is that Musk came out of the woods one day with technically revolutionary launcher-industry-disrupting rockets, catching Nasa by surprise. It is simply not true. He has some technical chops of course but his real strength was getting good people already doing interesting things (eg Tom Mueller, SpaceX head of propulsion) and get them all under one roof with his money and focus, and talking to as many people as possible to keep the string taught and avoid going down dead-end allies. This can't be done in a vacuum.<p>So the reason for this comment is to illustrate that people seem to be discarding their critical faculties when it comes to Musk, and getting carried away with excitement to the point of being irrational. That simply shouldn't be allowed to happen in a community like this, whose signal to noise ratio is, in other respects, among the highest on the web.<p>I don't know why it is, maybe it's because people think he's a good example of someone winning the game that they're playing (web widgets for a huge payout so they can work on something they think is more meaningful) but I'm sure he's the exception that proves the rule about web start-ups. I've certainly seen comments on SpaceX threads where people get defensive about their social thingamie because one day the payoff will let them work on <i>real</i> problems too. But this seems silly to me if that's the actual reason, as improbable as a hobby tennis player making a career plan that requires him to win Wimbledon. If you actually want to work in some field that holds you passion, and that's not what you're doing now, consider carefully if your long term plan is as unrealistic as my caricature above. Especially if it's space, stuff is really damn exciting right now. Take a look at something like Reaction Engines [4] in the UK, who just this week announced successful testing of their precooler. Have a look at the video on their website - this really really is revolutionary stuff, not taking existing tech and doing it faster+better+cheaper, but inventing really game-changing, throw-out-the-rule-book technology (I'm gushing now, irony). If I wanted to do something exciting in space, I think I'd be far more likely to be able to make a dent in the universe by going to work for someone like these guys or SpaceX than by some dream about billion dollar buyouts.<p>Whatever, I've digressed from my point which is that I think a lot of people are wearing the kool-aid version of beer-goggles, which are distorting their vision. Elon has done same fabulously praise-worthy stuff, his accomplishments stand up on their own merits without us (seemingly sometimes wilfully) losing perspective or distorting the context in which they were achieved.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3723065"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3723065</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastrac_(engine)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastrac_(engine)</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.barber-nichols.com/products/rocket-engine-turbopumps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.barber-nichols.com/products/rocket-engine-turbopu...</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/</a>",1342191084

4239984,comment,4239150,4239150,4,0,tokenadult,,,"I see several examples here of native speakers of two or more languages in the same language family (e.g., Indo-European). Our example at home is two older children (one who is grown up now, making his living as a hacker) who were brought up as native first-language speakers of both Mandarin Chinese and General American English. My wife is trilingual, growing up in a home that spoke Taiwanese (Taiwan dialect of Minnan Chinese), learning Mandarin as the sole language of school instruction, and learning English beginning in junior high school. Her higher education was in the United States, in the medium of English (of course). I grew up as a monolingual native speaker of General American English (although both my parents had had some foreign language instruction in school, in different languages, and each had living relatives born in the United States who were native speakers of non-English languages). I began learning Chinese, among several other languages, while at university, after learning German and Russian at school.<p>Oddly, the first language I ever spoke to my wife was actually Japanese, the usual Japanese greeting for a first-time meeting, "". ."" Over the years, we have grown strongly to prefer speaking English with each other (from initially mostly speaking Mandarin with each other) because she finds it more congenial to speak what is really on her mind when speaking English. That's a cultural difference between American culture and Taiwanese culture--greater frankness in family conversations in America.<p>We were quite resolute in speaking Mandarin whenever we were together, whether living in the United States or in Taiwan, as our two older sons were growing up. I would speak to them in English if I was alone with one or both of them. They switched effortlessly from English to Chinese or back as my wife was present or not.<p>Literacy is HARD to maintain in languages in which the relationship between speech and writing is more remote than in English, as is surely the case in Chinese. I know many, many, many native speakers of Chinese who received their primary, secondary, and even higher educations in Chinese-speaking countries who forget how to write many Chinese characters if they spend a lot of time abroad. Computer input used to be nasty for Chinese, but it is coming along now even in American versions of Windoze. Literature is also more interesting to read if it is uncensored by the government, which gives English-language literature an enormous worldwide draw. But it is definitely life-enriching and thought-provoking to know two or more languages to reasonably high proficiency, and I have enjoyed spending the majority of my life able to communicate in Chinese.<p>One considerable advantage for the child who grows up bilingual is learning yet more languages as second languages when an adult more readily than do adults who grew up speaking only one language. By diligent study of linguistics, after having some foreign language study (German) that began in elementary school, I acquired enough Chinese to work professionally as an interpreter and a translator, and have enough reading German to be able to do research in that language, and smatterings of other languages. But all the native bilingual members of my family do much better than I do per unit of time in learning languages, so they have many choices before them as occasion arises to learn other languages for various purposes. That helps with second-language acquisition of an understandable pattern of pronunciation, too.",1342190404

Code is not used side by side like an infantry of little computer processes working in parallel to make computers or phones go. It is rather organised and packaged in a huge network of building blocks, a pyramid of hundreds of thousands of libraries, APIs or functions heavily inter-dependent on each other. Whats more, the building blocks are usually not all written by the same people or organisations and a consistent interface is critical for enabling compatibility (often between millions of parts made by thousands of developers).<p>This hierarchical and networked architecture is inevitable and it is the best way to organize such complex information, however the stability it requires at the bottom of the pyramid of code means that some building blocks cannot be changed once the pyramid is built. Someone claiming ownership of the shape of a bottom-center block after the pyramid is built, someone having the power to force a bottom block to be removed and replaced with a different shaped one, no matter how simple and obvious this bloc is, does not have power over just this block but over the whole structure above it and all the components that depend on it. This means patent holders have a disproportionately large amount of power when they target such a bloc.  From a possibly trivial piece at the bottom, they can control a vastly more sophisticated structure built on top which they had no part in conceiving. They know that changing it would require tearing down, redesigning and replacing often tons of dependent work and probably break compatibility for huge amounts of users of these projects.",1342190131

You cannot have every combination of desirable properties you can dream up. There will be combinations that are too expensive. The example here is that we want a reference rate called ""LIBOR"" that is set by the market, but that is defined for every point in time. That's just not possible, because markets can freeze up. When there are no transactions there is no market rate.

People are likely to think you are quieter than you normally are (in your own language), basically that you are less of everything you actually are.<p>It takes a long time, I find, to reach a comfort level in another language that rivals that of how you express yourself in your mother tongue.

Sekilas tentang keputihan.\nKeputihan<p>Keputihan atau Fluor Albus merupakan sekresi vaginal abnormal pada wanita. Keputihan yang disebabkan oleh infeksi biasanya disertai dengan rasa gatal di dalam vagina dan di sekitar bibir vagina bagian luar. Yang sering menimbulkan keputihan ini antara lain bakteri, virus, jamur atau juga parasit. Infeksi ini dapat menjalar dan menimbulkan peradangan ke saluran kencing, sehingga menimbulkan rasa pedih saat si penderita buang air kecil.<p>Gejala keputihan<p><pre><code>    Keluarnya cairan berwarna putih kekuningan atau putih kelabu dari saluran vagina. Cairan ini dapat encer atau kental, dan kadang-kadang berbusa. Mungkin gejala ini merupakan proses normal sebelum atau sesudah haid pada wanita tertentu.\n\n    Pada penderita tertentu, terdapat rasa gatal yang menyertainya. Biasanya keputihan yang normal tidak disertai dengan rasa gatal. \n\n    Keputihan juga dapat dialami oleh wanita yang terlalu lelah atau yang daya tahan tubuhnya lemah.\n\n    Pada bayi perempuan yang baru lahir, dalam waktu satu hingga sepuluh hari, dari vaginanya dapat keluar cairan akibat pengaruh hormon yang dihasilkan oleh plasenta atau uri.\n\n    Gadis muda kadang-kadang juga mengalami keputihan sesaat sebelum masa pubertas, biasanya gejala ini akan hilang dengan sendirinya.\n</code></pre>\nPenyebab keputihan secara umum adalah:<p><pre><code>    Sering memakai tissue saat membasuh bagian kewanitaan, sehabis buang air kecil maupun buang air besar\n    Memakai pakaian dalam yang ketat dari bahan sintetis\n    Sering menggunakan WC Umum yg kotor\n    Tidak mengganti panty liner\n    Membilas vagina dari arah yang salah.

That's not how this works.  If you want to combat a study you need to do so with another one, not by just saying throwing out untested assumptions.<p>>From what I have seen, people who leave vim in insert mode are the ones making mode errors. Insert mode isn't the rest mode for vim, normal mode is. You are bound to make errors when starting because out of habit, your mind assumes insert mode as the rest state.<p>Thanks for the condescension.  Have you ever started to type a word and had your hands just finish it for you?  Sometimes there will be some relatively large word that I type out commonly enough that when my hands notice the first few letters of it they'll type it out automatically with me having to go back and delete it and type out the similar starting word I meant to write.  I even recall having my hands do it again on the correction once.<p>Having this kind of muscle memory is a killer for vi usage.  Lots of times I have intentionally left the editor in insert mode for just a second while I grab some text from, say, a website to paste in.  What I didn't realize is that my hands knew to always get back to command mode when changing screens so even though my mind had tried to save keystrokes my hands defeated me.  The result?  Pasted a huge document into command mode.  Great.  Similar sync issues came up regularly enough that I typically mashed Esc 2-4 times (in case there was, e.g. a command active that would write in the Esc char) rapidly before starting anything to ensure that I was where I thought I was.<p>In my experience, I wouldn't get the time savings I should have been getting due to having to slow down for the mode management.",1342188833

This simple clear economic approach -- Posner's broadly -- is the only sensible way to understand actual law and activity here.<p>All that stuff about 'personhood' and 'intellectual domination' and 'possession' is otiose. Any attempt to make an <i>a priori</i> case for intellectual monopoly seems certainly doomed to failure -- for a very simple reason: they do not fit the basic physical facts.<p>Informational goods are nonrival: they are copyable and usable with no loss to the original. The relation between copies of information is abstract. A copy <i>adds</i> its value, and subtracts nothing.<p>Two notable ethical points follow from that. Copying is consistent with the principle of universalisation: a general rule that all should copy is not self-contradictory -- the opposite: if we all do it, we all gain. Second, <i>restriction</i> of copying <i>fails</i> a basic rights-justification or liberty principle: we are restricted only so far as we would harm someone else, yet for the notion of unauthorised copying any claim of loss has no grounds in any physical fact.<p>Ultimately, we want to be governed by the basic physical facts and how their constraints and ramifications allow us best advantage. 'Personhood' justifications for intellectual monopoly seem about as reasonable a basis for regulating behaviour as believing that taking a photo takes someone's soul.",1342188323

We don't live in a perfect world, and brilliant people make trade-offs. Unless you know what kind of trade-offs they made, you can't generalize their choices. For instance, when Peter Norvig switched from Lisp to Python for his classes, many people argued that Python was an ""acceptable Lisp"". When asked about his decision, Norvig answered that Python was a better choice for his teaching goals, and nothing else.<p>Also, let's not confuse techniques with tools. It is unfortunate that, other than modal editing which is too generic, we don't have a name for Vi-style editing which does not involve Vi, so people confuse Vi-style editing (e.g. the technique), with Vi (e.g. the tool).

The point of patents is to allow for a monopoly for a limited time while a product ormideamis being invented. It was never a mechanism to be bought out by a larger company!<p>This entire argument is rife with problems.

Poster gives a variety of solutions, but the two solutions that would probably be most equitable are to reduce the term of software patents (no more than 10 years), force licensing terms when infringements are found (the license terms should be determined along with the patent), and a way of ensuring that any patent filed must have a commercial product of some form in the market within 5 years, else you lose the patent.<p>Administration of patents should be resolved too - there are too many patentsm being granted that should not be.",1342188013

They can no longer easily grab the top talents without direct confrontation with the local giants.<p>In the Enterprise space, where a lot of development is done in China, the top universities are often avoided, and have been so for quite some time, and purposely so.  The reason is staff attrition:  People freshly versed in the company&#x27;s systems and applications often leave when they realise they don&#x27;t want to develop tiny incremental changes in JAVA, or merge a COBOL codebase, and this is the case for top talent.

Or just &quot;ET&quot; or &quot;Eastern&quot;, which are good year-round.<p>Point taken. :)<p>>Doesn&#x27;t this mean that crossing a panel boundary means we need to pop up the stack?<p>Aha! Yes, now that I&#x27;m looking closely, I think that is possible, since the logic that handles crossing outside of the current &quot;pos&quot; pixel boundary is re-entrant.<p>However, I note that the line numbers in your trace are alternating. This looks suspiciously like an oscillation between the &quot;need to zoom out and find a new pos&quot; and &quot;need to zoom in and set pos&quot; states. It just occurred to me that since these conditionals compare floating point positions directly, it might be possible for a precision error to cause such a loop.<p>This exercise has made me realize a benefit to the mess of carrying code that happens further down, when wrapping around the 4 panels that are actively being displayed. That code will in principle operate past the point where a recursive implementation will stack trace, FWIW. According to StackOverflow [1], that&#x27;ll be around 25K/50K nestings in Chrome/Firefox.<p>>Would mipmapping help any here?<p>Yep! The current implementation only scales an image once per render, caching the resultant image data and reusing it for all of the other draws [2]. Images are also pre-scaled to various intervals (for example [3]), though that was to improve image scaling rather than performance. Actually, while working on the mipmapping implementation, I found evidence that the canvas putImageData call (for image buffers) is a good deal slower than drawIamge [4]. It looks like where I left things, I&#x27;m still using putImageData. Tomorrow, I&#x27;ll try caching the actual canvas elements and see if that gives the predicted huge performance boost.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/7828803"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/7828803</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/chromakode/xkcd-pixels/blob/master/zoom.js#L516"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chromakode/xkcd-pixels/blob/master/zoom.j...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://imgs.xkcd.com/turtledown/turtles-tiled.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgs.xkcd.com/turtledown/turtles-tiled.png</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://jsperf.com/canvas-drawimage-vs-putimagedata/3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsperf.com/canvas-drawimage-vs-putimagedata/3</a>",1410168416

Naturally, this led to a lot of resentment amongst the new non-Arab Muslims who would later support the Abbasid rebellion against the Umayyads.&quot;<p>First the Jizya was not a Tax payed because they weren&#x27;t Muslims. It was payed for everyone who didn&#x27;t participate in Islamic military. Think of it like a Latino living in the US and paying a fee (passport fees, green card fees..etc) for not participating in US military.

The brain is developing very rapidly at this age, and having seen the curriculum it seems bizarre to me.

In most cases you are using time tracking as a way to provide metrics for productivity or compensation. Once employees are incentivized to do a task within a certain time frame (i.e. average ticket close less than 2 hours) they will focus more on the end result (closing the ticket) rather than the actual task at hand (fixing the issue).

3093157,comment,3092558,3093041,1,0,cromwellian,,,"Dart is OSS, so I geuss if it really got mass adoption, Firefox and IE could adopt it. Yes, this would lead to a single implementation, I'm not sure how I feel about this. On the one hand, it limits innovation from multiple implementations, on the other hand, incompatibilities between implementations, have been a big source of programmer headache in the first place. Flash was not bad in that respect and is one reason for it's success, despite its shortcomings.  I mean, with Unix, most people are running a single implementation: Linux Kernel, and no one really cares about Open Solaris, or Darwin anymore.<p>Really though, Brendan has made the argument that Javascript is fixable and that it is a good target for higher level languages, and I don't really agree with either of them.<p>The changes I see being planned for ES.next don't really address some of the fundamental problems with JS, like network transport, or startup costs because of legacy constraints of not wanting to break existing JS. On mobile devices, loading a lot of Javascript is expensive, and I don't see anything in ES.next to bring it anywhere near competitive with native. If mobile is the future and the predominant way we consume the web, then we are at big risk of being dominated by native. Can we afford to wait years more for a promised fix that isn't even in sight?<p>For a mobile device, ideally you'd want a dynamic language that could be atleast partially statically optimized for a particular device platform, and transmitted in a highly compact format that is cheap to parse and execute on a mobile VM to not make the device waste bandwidth or precious battery performing tasks that could be done on the server for it (like executing a parse and eval)<p>Likewise, I don't agree that JS is an ideal intermediate format for higher level languages to compile to. I'm not saying LLVM or JVM bytecode are either, but if your HLL contains numerics like 64-bit ints or longs, for example, it's pretty crappy to translate. There's also double costs here: You're running a HLL compiler to parse, compile, and optimize one language, which then must be parsed, evaled, and optimized a second time on your target CPU.<p>Something like DVM, or a bytecode specifically designed for JS would be better I think.",1318242719

This is very useful for programmers who already understand the concepts that are being glossed over by the shiny syntax, but beginners may struggle to comprehend their own bugs / problems, or even explain them to others if they do not understand exactly how their language of choice is helping them by cutting out the boiler-plate.<p>All that being said - there are much worse places to start than Python.

You also cannot add such type inference to an object-oriented language, like Scala (it may be possible, but very hard and nobody did it).<p><pre><code>     the main benefit is catching errors early\n</code></pre>\nDynamic typing isn't about not specifying types. Dynamic typing is about creating types at runtime.<p>This enables certain techniques that are very productive, and totally different from what you would do in a language like Haskell, which does have full-type inference.<p>I also do not think a static language would work as a client-side in-browser language, simply because of the nature of browsers and the web. Such a language needs runtime introspection and even types created at runtime like air. For in-browser stuff I also prefer eval() over static-typing any day of the week.",1318242493

Its not either.\n	On the other hand the surprise of seeing it coming out looking so mainstream (i.e. its a mix of javascript and java) is a reminder that really the language doesn't matter that much.  The blub paradox is not half as important as one intuitively gives it credit for. See Peter Norvig's comments about how C++ programmers can be as productive as Lispers. Look at something like the iphone. The implementation behind the shiny interface is boringly mainstream, C, objective-C with standard OO GUI framework. Like it or not Google and Apple are about engineering and getting things done. From that point of view something like Haskell might improve things slightly but not half enough to make a significant difference to the end product. i.e. it just doesn't matter.<p>In summary when I saw the language this morning my first thought was: ""Nothing to see here"". But as a result my second was: ""Get back to work"". Maybe that's not so bad.",1318242438

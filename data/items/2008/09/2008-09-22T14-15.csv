311183,comment,311132,311132,0,0,technoguyrob,,,"I don't know why the second-top one has so many votes, it's completely wrong.<p><pre><code>   var x = 1;
   var y = 3;
   var list = [0,1,2];
   x in list; //true
   y in list; //false
   1 in list; //true
   y in [3,4,5]; //true
</code></pre>
That last expression is <i>false</i>. This is because the ""in"" operator does <i>not</i> check for values in the list; it checks for keys. Try this:<p><pre><code>   javascript:alert(3 in [3,4,5])
</code></pre>
The only things that will be true for ""X in [3,4,5]"" are 0, 1, and 2 for X (since these are the natural keys for the terms in the array). More specifically, ""in"" in general checks for members associated with objects (e.g., keys in an array, methods of a class, etc.):<p><pre><code>   javascript:alert(""The setFlag method "" + (""setFlag"" in {setFlag:function(){}} ? ""exists"" : ""does not exist""))
</code></pre>
EDIT: This makes the keyword considerably less useful (since indexOf doesn't work for the Array object in IE--although jQuery has a way around this), although it can be used to replace the less elegant<p><pre><code>   if (typeof object.method == ""undefined"")</code></pre>",1222095368

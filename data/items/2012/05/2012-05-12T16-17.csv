The extreme simplicity and flexibility of the language lend themselves well to the kind of special-case explosion that often occurs as I tinker with game logic, and puzzling out the cleanest way to express complicated ideas is very intellectially satisfying. Working on a simulated game console with no underlying operating system and unrestricted access to memory seems to be an ideal case for the language.<p>If anybody's curious, all my development tools and forth code are on github: <a href=""https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Mako"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Mako</a>",1336841985

That can vary locally, and over time, but it must apply to all cases filed at the same court at a time.<p>These rules exist to ensure that judges can't take over cases they wish to distort in some way (eg. because they don't like the plaintiff or defendant, they have a strict opinion on the subject matter, ...).<p>Unfortunately, the rules used in some places here allow(ed) the plaintiff to skew things in their favor (if they want a certain judge to handle the case). If assignment depends on the date of filing, they wait for the right day. If it's semi-random (but guessable to some very high degree based on prior day's assignments), they check the records to find the right timing...

You have in your presidency one or maybe two chances to appoint a new judge.<p>That judge is going to sit there for about 20 years. As you see right now with the upcoming supreme court decision on the healthcare issue, the decision is most likely going to be made along the party lines, with most of the decision power hanging on the mercy of a single judge. If you are the president and have the ability to appoint/suggest a judge, you need to find someone that you can rely on to keep his political leaning intact for the next 20 years. Otherwise you are significantly reducing the chances to see your worldview represented in the rulings for the next 20+ years.

Not until a couple of years later, when Linux was everywhere.

Although I agree that Linus Torvalds and Larry Wall had strong university background. Development of things like Linux and Perl happened in the most unconventional environments, to solve the most unexpected problems. Software design was taken over by hackers from academics and researches in big labs run by corporates.<p>For most talented people who didn't participate in those movements at that time, they basically a lost a shot at making their mark in history.

Suppose candidate #2 says ""well, a golf ball is such and such size, and there is empty space around each ball, and the bus is such and such size.....""<p>What, exactly, have we learned here? In my experience, nothing.<p>Having gone through this cycle as both a candidate as well as hiring manager (not my choice to use this line of questioning), the real-world results I've found is little to no correlation between candidate responses and accurate assessment of logic process. The false positive/negative outcomes were significantly higher, and the success rate for candidates into the positions we hired them for were mixed. Basically, these questions offered us nothing in finding candidates who would be successful in the position for which we were hiring.<p>If I were to ask a question such as this, it would be to gauge one's reaction to the question (assuming it's a stressor) and how they react.

If working on individual projects, sure. The problem is that best practices are an opinionated collection of tradeoffs. There are often other alternatives that may be better tradeoffs to work with for the situation. Most of the time, these tradeoffs involve coding style rather than any real functionality changes. At that point, whichever you advocate - either your own thought, or a ""best practice"" is going to cause disagreements among people. The ""best practice"" then, is a good option simply because you have a lot of public support behind it for whatever reason, so hopefully the people who disagree with that particular practice will be convinced to work with it.

Depending on the economic circumstances at the time, the ordinary person will vote for the person who promises to overcome their short-term pain, while ignoring the consequences for the long term.

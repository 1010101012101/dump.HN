Thus, while the less skilled programmer is still hacking away at the function, you are writing new functionality and earning twice as much while doing so.<p>Also, the less skilled programmer is going to have a hard time winning projects when his proposals are double the budget and four times the schedule length of yours.",1192769674

70150,comment,70073,70139,0,0,GammaStats,,,"It takes a lot of skill to identify the emerging companies of the future.  Why would they say something they do not mean?  You see VC's are very competitive.  The really good ones realize that there is untapped potential out there that are likely to be missed by the ""traditional VC's"".  Closed mindedness never innovates and this innovation creates the true leaders in any field.  <p>It's a lot like Ivy League universities.  They are under enormous pressure to perform and house the next great research endeavors.  Have you ever noticed that Ivy League universities never set strict requirements on admission whereas public universities do.  This is because they recognize that many innovative minds would be passed over if they set strict criteria.  Einstein, the great genious that he was, made lousy grades and was told by his early teachers that he would never make it in school.  In fact he was told he should drop out.  Einstein was actually told he did not belong in school.  Thats the product of closed mindedness.  It was not until Einstein recognized his true passions in life that he became the ""genious"" that he is considered today.  Quite frankly, it takes genious to recognize genious.  And traditional VC's don't have this genious.  That is why they would set more limits on who they fund.<p>We are all told how ruthless VC's can be and how they will take your company from you.  Michael Moritz of Sequoia capital invested a little over 12 million for a 10% stake in Google.  In fact, founders in these leading VC backed firms end up being recognized as the most powerful forces in the companies.  This is because the truly revolutionary VC's recognize that they do not have the vision of the founders.  They are willing to relinquish some control.<p>But I guess my point here is the leaders in any field are willing to listen to new ideas from new people because they must, to stay ahead in their game.  And that is what they want most of all. ",1192766944
70149,story,,,35,18,dhouston,"Rejection letter from summer 05",,"""We're sorry to say that we can't accept your proposal for the Summer
Founders Program.  We were surprised by the high quality of the
applications, and wanted to accept more.  But since this is the
first year, we decided we'd better force ourselves to keep the
program small enough to manage.<p>A lot of the proposals we rejected for reasons having nothing to
do with the quality of the applicants.  For example, we were very
reluctant to accept any proposals with only one founder, or only
one who could come to Cambridge, because we think starting a startup
is too much work for one person.  We also rejected a lot of proposals
simply because we didn't understand the problem domain well enough
to judge them, or because the project seemed too big to start on
only three months of funding.<p>It's quite likely, in fact, practically certain, that groups we
rejected will go on to create successful startups.  If you do, we'd
appreciate it if you'd send us an email making fun of us; we want
to learn from our mistakes.<p>If this summer works out, we're probably going to fund more startups.
(Check our site for announcements.)  If we do, we encourage you to
re-apply in the future.<p>Thanks<p>Y Combinator""<p>today might be a rough day for some. but if it's any encouragement, i was rejected in summer 05 and two years later (summer 07) applied with a different idea and more experience and was accepted. yc turned out to be mostly right about the problems with my first idea, and i learned a lot in the intervening two years.<p>so don't think it's the end -- hang in there!",1192766802

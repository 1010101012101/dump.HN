Here, we briefly detail integration with the Bitcoin protocol.&quot;<p>&quot;Zerocash breaks compatibility with the Bitcoin network. While Zerocash could be integrated into Bitcoin (the actual currency and its supporting software) via a “flag day” where a super-majority of Bitcoin miners simultaneously adopt the new software, we neither expect nor advise such integration in the near future and suggest using Zerocash in a separate altcoin.&quot;<p>&quot;Integrating Zerocash into Bitcoin consists of adding a new transaction type, Zerocash transactions, and modifying the protocol and software to invoke Zerocash’s DAP interface to create and verify these transactions. There are at least two possible approaches to this integration. The first approach replaces all bitcoins with zerocoins, making all transactions anonymous at the cost of losing any additional Bitcoin functionality provided by, e.g., the Bitcoin scripting language (see Section 6.1).\nThe second approach maintains this functionality, adding a parallel Zerocash currency, zerocoin, which can be converted to and from bitcoin at a one-to-one rate &quot;",1400471973

In some cases (especially with website hacking) those who create the spam will link to innocent third parties to create a smokescreen. Google can & does burn some of these &quot;drive by shooting&quot; sites to a crisp.<p>Check the people who try to drop profile links & comment spam links on your blog and such. Are there <i>any</i> websites which have as many spammy inbound links as YouTube does? How many people does Google allocate to cleaning up YouTube&#x27;s spammy link profile?<p>There&#x27;s another factor in that Google may shift what is considered reasonable over time. A buddy of mine got an unnatural link warning where the link cited was a link that has been in place LONGER THAN GOOGLE HAS EXISTED.<p>Now consider that some websites are bought & sold, change ownership, etc. ... does it make sense to penalize today for something which happened 10 or 15 years ago?<p>Another factor is that just by ranking you will pick up some scraper site inbound links you do not want. Many of those sites in various forms or fashion are monetized via Google ads. Google continues to run their ads on many of those aggregation sites, yet you may get an unnatural link penalty for having links from the same sites.<p>Good enough for Google, NOT good enough for you TM",1400471729

7765612,comment,7765047,7765383,2,0,dredmorbius,,,"Yes, thanks, corrected.<p>There&#x27;s a set of heterodox economic schools which hold that it&#x27;s principally energy which is responsible for economic growth, and specifically the abundance, const, and convenience of that energy.  Hydrocarbons, especially liquid hydrocarbons, are a spectacularly convenient form and store of energy.  Electricity is a useful <i>form</i> of energy, though it&#x27;s not particularly storeable.  This has been suggested and explored by numerous economists and others since the early Industrial Revolution, notably:  William Stanley Jevons (<i>The Coal Question</i> (1865)), US Navy Rear Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, Kenneth Boulding, Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, Charles Odum, Charles A.F. Hall, and others.  Generally, &quot;thermoeconomics&quot;, &quot;biophysical economics&quot;, or &quot;ecological economics&quot;.<p>Decoupling of energy (and resources generally) from GDP growth has been argued by numerous authors, though I find their case unconvincing.  It&#x27;s been argued <i>against</i> by others.<p>Global GDP vs. primary energy consumption shows a pretty strong correlation, and I find the causality argument plausible:  <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/42I4Jmf.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/42I4Jmf.png</a> (from Wolfram+Alpha).<p>Yes, efficiency has improved, but so has overall consumption:  <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/Hu0NWsI.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/Hu0NWsI.png</a><p>As for oil and GDP cycles:  my point is that while the price and supply of oil were highly stable, GDP variation was very regular.

Artificial Intelligence in the sense of what exists in Movies is either hard/close to impossible, despite several breakthroughs due to large scale processing.<p>However, there is a significant body of work that has been done in this field that may be off interest.<p>1. How does a Quadrotor fly? This could be an easy problem of getting an off the shelf quadrotor? Alternatively, you could learn a bit of control theory, get some modeling work done and figure out how to build your own Quadrotor? This is typically hard and you would need some math in your belt (Linear Algebra, Calculus, Dynamics and Control Systems ). Something off the level of a senior in an EE program.<p>2. Now that you have got the thing flying, what do you need next? You want it to follow someone. Let us make the problem simpler. Say, you want it to follow a line on a path. This could be as easy as building a program that tells the Quadrotor to keep following the line, which you will detect using a camera coupled with some edge detecting software.<p>3. How do you go after this? How do you make sure it follows someone? Same principle, instead of detecting edges, you have to make sure it detects a small moving object. Once you have figured that out, you iteratively progress till you figure out how to make it follow a person.<p>This is not the same as traditional Machine Learning. Although the same principles, a math heavy background with good programming skills can help you translate and make the switch.<p>If you are into Robotics or ML, a heavy math program coupled with good coding skills will always help you. It doesn&#x27;t have to be an EECS program. I did EECS. I know some excellent people who came from a Mechanical background. As far as courses are concerned, just go to college and keep working on your own personal projects, the structure of any Engineering program should be sufficient for your purpose.",1400470773

I&#x27;m of the mind that the one of most valuable changes that could be made is to tie a school&#x27;s accreditation (or more accurately, a given department&#x27;s) to their tenure-track:phd ratio. If every school were required to maintain something approaching 1:1 in those numbers, the disproportion of phd&#x27;s to open positions across the industry would eventually level out.  likewise tying accreditation to a maximum ratio of adjunct faculty would force schools to increase tenure positions.  Finally, grad students should unionize. In the grad student level, schools hold far too much power over student&#x27;s careers with no moderating influences. Given the amount grad schools depend on their own students for duties ranging from teaching to research, this is unacceptable, and unionization is historically one of the few effective means of balancing the scales.",1400470740

The government hands this money to the poor people who can choose to buy cable connections or not. (If they don&#x27;t, this is a sign that they have something better to use the money on.)<p>But I&#x27;m still having trouble seeing how this scenario improves on the original problem.<p>I thought that local governments were already charging $X for uses of rights of way, and build-out requirements are in addition to this.  So if I understand right, the idea is to charge more (say $(X + Y)) but not impose those requirements, and instead let the broadband companies decide where and when to build out; then distribute the excess $Y (and, possibly, funds from elsewhere) to subsidize Internet service for the poor.<p>The problem I see here is that, if I&#x27;m one of those N poor folks the broadband company decides it doesn&#x27;t want to build out to, I&#x27;m out of luck.  I don&#x27;t even have the <i>option</i> of buying broadband service, and offering up my $Y/N dollars does not give me much leverage to change that.  If enough of my neighbors got together and pooled our funds, <i>maybe</i> that would be enough to convince the company to build out to our neighborhood, but maybe not, especially if (1) the company has already decided our neighborhood isn&#x27;t worth it, or (2) building out would require the company to pay more in right-of-way fees (though maybe this is included in the initial $X+Y price?).<p>In short, it seems like our government trades the relatively strong leverage we have as a collected political force for the relatively weak leverage we each have as individuals, plus $Y/N dollars apiece.<p>In this particular case, that does not sound like a good trade, for the reasons I mentioned: Internet access is more or less essential infrastructure, and there is public interest in having nearly-universal access to that infrastructure, rather than a class of haves and a class of have-nots.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that the government doesn&#x27;t <i>trust</i> the poor (or really, anyone not yet built-out-to) to spend this money on responsibly.  Rather, it&#x27;s that divvying it up and letting individuals make their own decisions on how to spend it sacrifices political and economic <i>coordination</i>, which is required in this case to serve a desireable public end, near-universal access.  Solving coordination problems like this is a big part of why governments exist, and we shouldn&#x27;t be rushing to give up that coordination for individual decision making.

Once that happens, even if it starts for something &quot;nice&quot; like preventing large thefts, it can turn into censorship.<p><i>With</i> zerocash, I could see blockchain-based anonymous systems coexisting for low-throughput, high-persistence systems mainly going to blockchain tech, and high-throughput, non-inherent-decentralized systems doing their own Chaumian blinded token currencies.  And &quot;currencies&quot; not just being used for human payments, but lots of forms of resource allocation.",1400469111

Great people generally, and I&#x27;m glad to have them as friends. But I&#x27;ve just stopped telling them about new things I might be working on. If you&#x27;re doing a startup, extra discouragement is rarely something you need.<p>If a startup sounds dumb, that&#x27;s probably because you&#x27;re not an early adopter in the target market. As an example, the first personal computers were absolutely terrible for most people unless a) they were hugely in love with technology, or b) had a very specific business purpose that the tech could actually solve. A lot of people surely looked at early home computers and thought they were dumb businesses. In retrospect, we can tell which the dumb ones were, but at the time it sure wasn&#x27;t obvious.<p>If you want to help a friend whose startup idea is suspicious to you, don&#x27;t critique the idea; encourage them to prove the idea with their target audience. Prod them them to interview 10 potential customers and see how many have the hypothesized problem. Help them to do a concierge version [1] of the product and see how much money they can collect. Assist them in doing a landing page test.<p>But please don&#x27;t critique the <i>idea</i> unless you have deep expertise in the domain or are actually an early adopter in the target market.

Someone&#x27;s gender identity as woman, man, genderqueer, etc is, of course, not completely reducible to neurology or biology and has very significant social, historical, and subjective aspects.<p>Specifically, for myself: I&#x27;m a transsexual - i.e. I have a fairly rare neurological developmental condition that I&#x27;m undergoing treatment for.<p>But, much more importantly, I&#x27;m a woman - and that&#x27;s something much harder to define, something indescribably precious and wonderful, yet taken for granted and commonly denigrated.",1387580057

Certainly, if I change my statement to &quot;some port workers&quot; were economically damaged by the protest, purportedly on their behalf, in which they did not participate or call for, the point remains. Regarding the &quot;convenient mis-characterization&quot; -- my girlfriend worked in a major union for five years, specifically in the communications department; I know very well how to read statements made by, and on behalf of, union leaders. The kind of tension and political tiptoeing I described certainly exists.<p>The mere fact that we can point to two statements, one expressing support for Occupy, and one denouncing a specific Occupy action, <i>by definition</i> means that there is a conflict in strategy and tactics.<p>Now, I will grant that this is all based on my opinion and observation -- none of it is empirical or measured. So what? Supply some measurements if you think that my opinion is illegitimate. Tell me what percentage of Occupiers are actually from traditionally poor background -- those who suffer systemic disenfranchisement, a lack of role models, have insufficient access to education -- you know, the people who they claim to represent. If this is such a diverse movement of the working poor, go ahead and let me know how the demographics of self-identified Occupiers compares to that of East Oakland (the poorest neighborhood in Oakland.) Shit, speaking of diversity: I would be surprised to learn if even a <i>single percentage</i> of them were multilingual!<p>I&#x27;m all for advocating on behalf of those who have been systematically locked out of opportunity, who have never been able to access the things we all take for granted, which have made it possible for us to be so successful. The people I see at Occupy events are poor, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to me that it&#x27;s for a for lack of access. They are bitching, basically, because the opportunities for very well privileged slackers to get by decently without putting in too much effort have all dried up. The rest of us -- poor and working rich -- are busting our asses off.<p>Happy to be proven wrong, but these are my observations, and yes my biases too.",1387579589

6944527,comment,6943469,6943781,22,0,danudey,,,"A very similar situation is happening in Vancouver. In the older part of town, just past Gastown, Vancouver&#x27;s original neighbourhood, lies the Downtown East Side. The DTES is &#x27;Canada&#x27;s poorest postal code&#x27;, and is home to a large population of Vancouver&#x27;s homeless. In true Canadian fashion, it&#x27;s generally a safe and vibrant area, both despite and because of the homeless population living there (compared to the suburbs, where bored teenagers assault the elderly for something to do).<p>Recently, a few businesses have been cropping up; one of them, Save on Meats, opened a butcher shop and a diner; more accurately, re-opened, as Save on Meats was a cornerstone of the neighbourhood for decades before the previous owners closed it. The current owner bought the building, renovated it (or, more accurately, refurbished and restored it), began hiring the homeless and poor of the neighbourhood, and began a series of social programs aimed at benefitting the area. Their sandwich counter, a street-facing breakfast sandwich dispensary, introduced &#x27;sandwich tokens&#x27;, which can be bought from them in quantity and traded in by anyone for a warm meal. It&#x27;s a convenient way to give someone something that you know will be traded in for food, without having to go out of your way to purchase it. Everyone loves it, and even the police who patrol the DTES will give out tokens to people in the neighbourhood.<p>Another restaurant opened lately, called Pidgin, across from a location called Pigeon Park, a common area of congregation for the DTES&#x27;s residents, homeless or otherwise. On occasions, it&#x27;s blocked off and turned into a giant street market, where individuals sell whatever items they&#x27;ve managed to scrounge up, trade, for, buy, or sell. Pidgin is a nice restaurant, it&#x27;s the upper end of midrange, a place you could certainly go to in jeans and a button-down, but you might fit in better in a suit and tie.<p>Then came the protesters. The protesters came, spurred on by a feeling that Pidgin was making fun of the homeless people across the street, like a slap in the face. Ignoring the fact that Pidgin also hires people from the neighbourhood, the protesters congregated outside of the restaurant every day, shouting and harassing the restaurant, the staff, and the patrons. All this despite the fact that the people who actually live in the area disagree with them; both the homeless and jobless poor and the more well-to-do people who live, work, and own businesses in the area.<p>The other facet that the protesters seem to ignore is that part of the problem with the homeless population in Vancouver is a problem of perception; many people, especially those from the suburbs, see the DTES as full of dirty violent criminals, where you&#x27;ll get knifed for your sneakers before you know it, Canada&#x27;s Detroit. The reality is that these are just normal people in awful circumstances, making the best of what they have. The more people who see that, and who see how wrong their horrible misconceptions about the poor are, the easier it will be to gain support from the voting populace to improve conditions there, and the less uphill the fight will be to convince others that these people aren&#x27;t lost causes cluttering up the streets of Vancouver&#x27;s history.<p>The protesters never cared though. Even after being told by police to stop harassing people, even after being told off by people who&#x27;ve run businesses in the DTES for years, and working against the needs and wishes of the community in the DTES, they kept protesting.<p>And what population of them even live in the area? What population knows anything about the homeless that they&#x27;re white-knighting? None of them. They&#x27;re largely comprised of people from the suburbs, people who commute from all over the region to tell everyone how these people feel without ever asking them. Some leaders of the protest were even forced to give up their allegiances with organizations who actually aim to help the homeless populations, because their missions were so at odds and they were giving these charitable organizations such a bad name.<p>So the idea that trust-fund hipsters and well-meaning interlopers will thrust themselves violently and unnecessarily into a &#x27;class warfare&#x27; which didn&#x27;t exist (or wasn&#x27;t as heated or unpleasant) before their interference isn&#x27;t a strictly Oakland issue either. This behaviour, which focusses on driving people apart and creating open conflict where none existed, contrasts directly with what is necessary, which is for people to understand one another and interact.<p>It&#x27;s pretty sad.",1387578509

6944366,comment,6942145,6944213,5,0,sedev,,,"But it&#x27;s also wrong to say that an institution and its members are completely separate. They aren&#x27;t and can&#x27;t be. There is no institution without members, and there are no members without an institution to be a member of. You&#x27;ve got to deal with them as entangled, and treat them as such. There are <i>varying degrees</i> of responsibility for acts that we attribute to an institution, because generally we&#x27;re talking about institutions with internal hierarchies. So for example General Keith Alexander is much more culpable than a random sysadmin. But because of the responsibility-diffusing nature of institutions, no, you can&#x27;t completely let members off the hook without also letting the institution off the hook.<p>By the way, about your Mafia/Nazi examples: a zealous prosecutor could easily charge the housekeeper, and the police and FBI would certainly lean on them a bit whilst investigating the boss. That&#x27;s totally commonplace. Meantime, in the case of the literal Nazis, yes, there were in fact consequences for such people (leaving aside that you&#x27;ve constructed that scenario very poorly).",1387576894

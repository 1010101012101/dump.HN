But I don&#x27;t think these two are so different.<p>My definition of technical debt would be &quot;problems in the code base that make it harder than it should be to do work,&quot; whether that work is adding new features, fixing bugs, scaling up, etc. The startup that can implement new features quickly because their code base isn&#x27;t a disaster is more likely to succeed. They can try out new features quickly, seeing what customers respond to.<p>Customers need things like uptime, minimal bugginess, quick bug fixes, etc. Technical debt reduces uptime, increases bugginess, and makes it harder to fix bugs.<p>I think it would be hard to point at a startup and say &quot;technical debt killed it&quot;. In most cases I imagine there are many inter-related causes of failure, but an inability to quickly add new features, fix bugs, and keep the system stable can&#x27;t be a good thing!",1437879571
9949977,comment,9948255,9949296,0,0,mikeash,,,"First of all, so what? Somebody with a lengthy and violent criminal history still has just as much of a right not to get killed by police as I do. Only if there is an imminent threat to life which lethal force is <i>required</i> to stop should the police use it.<p>Second, while true it can still be racist. For an example in a slightly different direction, take a look at Sandra Bland. The whole business started when she got pulled over while driving. One could say that it was totally legitimate to do so, because she did in fact commit a traffic infraction. I would say that it&#x27;s still bad behavior by the policeman and most likely racist behavior, because it was a trivial infraction that tons of people commit every day, often in front of police, and almost never get pulled over for it.<p>In the case of victims of police shootings being violent criminals, that may be true for victims of all races, but the violent criminal history is emphasized much more for black people. So even if the histories are there for all races, if the histories are only brought up as justification when the victim is black, then the phrasing you object to is still accurate.",1437879535

I have had trouble with teachers, being something of an unruly kid to them at times. It&#x27;s easy to paint most anyone in such a light.<p>Why should I get shot close to my home?

Then when I was about to get one of these dongles, as usual and as for the above radio, I got sucked into the reviews suggesting this or that other model for better sensitivity or extra features. Now I understand the price range for these cheap sticks is just in the order of a few tenths at maximum, but maybe there is a chance anyone has investigated a bit more on the available choices already?<p>For example.. the one that has been written about in the article has 4 stars and 159 reviews while the first alternative in the &quot;Amazon recommends&quot; box has some 940 reviews and same 4 star score for just £ +2 (but I&#x27;m not even sure they do exactly the same things.. sorry). So, just wondering, maybe someone has already gone through this search and can recommend the best one to get?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Tecsun-PL-660-Portable-Shortwave-Single/dp/B004H9C4JK"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Tecsun-PL-660-Portable-Shortwave-Singl...</a>",1437879468

9949967,comment,9943159,9947029,0,0,TodPunk,,,"In that case, yes, it would be interesting to make a system to verify such and probably doable in the short term (ignoring the UI issues which are separate).  The problem still remains the same that your speech recognition is going to be very spotty on untrained processing, so you can at best (key word there) match maybe 500 words on one accent pool.  This means you have a limited set of questions and it does make it a barrier to entry, but certainly not unbeatable and definitely much more in favor of the AI programmer.<p>This is also why your average big-company automated attendant is so bad at interpreting what you want outside of the 5 common things people want to talk about (most of which I can do online, so it&#x27;s never what I&#x27;m there for) and again sadly only if you&#x27;re in the more common US American English accent pool.  Southern accents tend to get squelched pretty bad and that&#x27;s just the beginning of accents common in the US.<p>One could conceivably target an individuals desired accent recognition so you could let the user say &quot;Most of my callers speak in an X accent&quot; and then get a little more accurate for that pool of callers, but this also means installing disparate systems for recognition, each of which are quite expensive computationally.<p>This is a deeply interesting problem space, though, and if you&#x27;re interested there&#x27;s quite a bit of discussion over it in the sphinx project and several research communities.",1437879362

9949960,comment,9949278,9949278,0,0,olympus,,,"The author mentions that he used &quot;A 2 metre bit of wire jammed in the screwhole at the base of the tiny antenna&quot; to try and get better reception.  While the signal he is receiving is in the 2-meter band, a monopole antenna works better if it is 1/4 the wavelength, so he might actually get better reception with a 0.5 meter length of wire.  What he created is usually called a &quot;random wire&quot; antenna, and may deliver acceptable performance with a strong signal.<p>But the NOAA satellites (and quite a few other satellites) use a circularly polarized signal, and for just a tiny bit more money (perhaps the cost of the dongle) you can make a MUCH better antenna for circularly polarized signals.  Some designs are just helixes made with coax cable, some are just a couple of wires in an x-shape.<p>Google is your friend, and building an antenna is a fun cheap weekend project and will greatly enhance your results when hunting for satellite signals.<p>P.S. if you make a circularly polarized antenna and you discover that you made a LH polarization instead of the RH that you wanted (or vice versa), just turn the antenna upside down.  It may behoove you if you are planning on listening to signals with both polarities to construct one that is easily flipped over.",1437879073

This reply is a bit of a digression from the article, but I think still germane to the over-all conversation.)<p><i>> the scope of which may even be implied</i><p>Scraping the web and analyzing a website&#x27;s content is the basis for the primary feature of arguably the world&#x27;s most successful website. Why should Google expect to be able to use this content in one way, but other users not expect to be able to use it in a different way?<p>Where is the implied bright line?<p>Ultimately, a post-Craigslist-victory world introduces a situation where anyone can sue anyone else they feel is both threatening and also vulnerable. That would have serious and negative consequences for the internet as a whole.<p><i>> That ethical principle applies just as much to websites as coffee shops.</i><p>It does not.<p>We <i>already</i> distinguish between physical and cyber trespassing, even in a lot of ways that benefit website operators.<p>The CFAA exists specifically because trespassing law doesn&#x27;t immediately extend in an obvious fashion to websites.<p>If the legal extension has to be explicit, it&#x27;s worth asking whether an implicit ethical extension makes sense. And physical and intellectual property are different enough that this conversation is non-trivial.<p><i>> Just because Craigslist makes its website available to the public for a defined purpose does not mean it&#x27;s not trespass for a company to access that data for a different purpose.</i><p>There are substantive differences worth considering.<p>Most importantly, websites can <i>and do</i> regularly and maliciously change their terms without public notice, as in this case. This practice isn&#x27;t common, and probably wouldn&#x27;t be accepted, in the case of physical private property (that&#x27;s open to the public).<p>Suppose the coffee shop introduced a &quot;no other coffee shop owners allowed&quot; policy, posted along with 20 pages of other policies outside their store, and then filed suit a few days after posting the amended 20 pages on its front door (with no notice of change).<p>The other coffee shop owner might have been technically trespassing, and hell, a judge might even concede that point. But regardless, judges aren&#x27;t (supposed to be) banal computer programs applying law without context or human judgement.

We had probably 20 features that should have been developed that would have benefitted our clients.  Instead I allowed our team to focus on scalability (which wasn&#x27;t really an issue at the time),  plus we migrated databases, added ElasticSearch for full text search (which wasn&#x27;t an issue yet),  reengineered a number of features, all of which were working, although maybe not ideally.<p>Also, almost everything you mentioned is on my list of WTF was I thinking.  We wasted time adjusting code to meet new standards, adding tests to things we knew we were changing, adding scalability to places we had no scalability issues with (yet), adding new interfaces/code in places where something &quot;might&quot; happen etc.  None of these changes benefitted a client directly, so IMO we lost money on every one of those initiatives.  The reality is a lot of the code we &quot;brought up to standards&quot; was rewritten anyway when we started adding features and refactoring the old code to interface these features.    I also allowed the team to create their own modules instead of extending some existing node.js modules that existed in the community, which to me was a waste when I saw what we did. We would have done better to extend the community modules and open source them back to the community.<p>As for documentation, honestly, we have pretty good documentation, although I wouldn&#x27;t say it is without issues.<p>Overall I considered last year, the year of the &quot;it might happen&quot; screw ups.

9949876,comment,9948749,9949350,0,0,vidarh,,,"Here&#x27;s a short-list of some very simple things you can easily do in assembler which are either hard for a compiler to do, or which requires all kinds of extra optimization &quot;magic&quot;. A lot of it boils down to having more information available:<p>* Allocate registers globally or across large substs. Especially when targeting architectures (like x86_64, but unlike i386) with decent numbers of available registers, this has lots of potential for typical applications that e.g. frequently needs to access common data structures. Compilers for many languages (e.g. C) have a hard time doing this if doing separate compilation per module (since you need to be able to link to code that hasn&#x27;t been optimized the same way). You need whole-program optimization for this typically, but when programming assembler, it&#x27;s the natural thing to do if you have enough registers to treat some of them as assigned to specific variables that you know will be frequently accessed.<p>* Omit stack frames entirely or selectively. Many compilers have options for doing this, but often still ends up pushing/popping more stuff than necessary for things like local variable frames and arguments, where a programmer will often see that a function is not going to use much space and decide to put in extra effort to shuffle things around to keep things in registers only.<p>* Selectively violate the &quot;normal&quot; calling conventions. E.g. if you have a utility function you often need to use in settings where it&#x27;s convenient not to clobber certain registers, then you can opt to pass arguments in different registers easily. This again takes whole-program optimization for a compiler to do.<p>* Avoid saving/restoring certain registers based on the functions you&#x27;re calling. Again requires whome-program optimization for the compiler to know that the function you&#x27;re calling won&#x27;t clobber specific registers.<p>* Specifically adjust what registers you&#x27;re using based on what registers may be clobbered by other code you&#x27;re calling to avoid having to save/restore.<p>Other things include similarities/patterns in code that are non-obvious in a higher level language because it depends on how the code is translated, which often can allow you to re-write things to eliminate common sub-expressions that are not actually visible/present in the high level code.<p>It&#x27;s not that compilers can&#x27;t do all of these if given sufficient freedom and information, but it often violates expectations of the higher level environment (e.g. separate compilation in C)",1437877111

Imagine a discussion board run by any company where you authenticate with your external Bring-Your-Own-Data credentials. Through some SQL-like interface, that site is able to create tables and add data to the database but associating ownership of each piece of data with your identity.<p>At any time you can revoke your permission for their access to this data, or share it with others. Any modification to that data is version controlled so a hostile site cannot just modify/delete the data you created on it -- you&#x27;d still be able to gain access to any old version.<p>From a developer POV I think the key would be a SQL-like interface with appropriate caching/conflict resolution so you essentially just connect to a locally running proxy. Perhaps the advantage for the developer is some kind of tiered storage (e.g. your 100 GB database of posts is mostly stored in this external database with a 5% hot data cache local).<p>From a user&#x27;s POV, you know noone can take your data and hoard it. Transformation of the data from one service to another similar seems like it would be easier compared to hoping someone writes a good API for export/import. E.g. consider if you could write:<p><pre><code>      INSERT INTO feedly.reader (SELECT feedname, feed_url FROM google.reader);\n</code></pre>\nto migrate YOUR data from Google Reader to Feedly -- not just in a 3-month sunset period while Reader shuts down, but forever and ever.<p>If you want to be paranoid, the database could be federated, so rather than it being central, multiple providers can complete for your data.<p>All this could certainly make compliance with the European data protection act easier.",1437876917

Normally I&#x27;d think that using some kind of dedicated SSL terminating proxy, either a new version of HAproxy -- or stunnel/stud or similar -- would make more sense than deploying a new TLS stack that hasn&#x27;t been through any outside review?<p>That said, as mentioned by others here - openssl is clearly not a great example of a secure/good TLS implementation. I&#x27;m not sure there are any (yet). Hopefully libressl will become one. Personally I&#x27;d like to see a minimal library that combined a couple of AES/ECC primitives and implemented TLS 1.2+ only (No SSL), with a sane and clean API on top.<p>Something along the lines of NaCl but with a goal to support a subset of standard TLS with forward secrecy (and explicitly throw old clients under the bus, Android 2x be dammed).",1437876391

I&#x27;ve heard this story many many times. Yes - google makes billions in profits and could in theory hire someone to handle gmail issues. But, they don&#x27;t and it makes sense from a business point of view (why spend money on a guy who will support a service that doesn&#x27;t make money?).<p>> It could happen on anyone&#x27;s cell phone as well, how many fortune 500 companies have higher up employees with cell phones and gmail accounts?<p>If a Fortune 500 company uses gmail they would buy the google apps for work. If they buy google apps for work they get an 800 number to call if they have problems (and most likely a dedicated account rep because they are probably buying 1000s of accounts).<p>> Imagine in the future trusting google with a self driving car and home automation<p>Again - you would be giving money to google. And in return you will get support. I&#x27;m not saying Google is perfect but if self driving cars become a thing I&#x27;m sure (hope) there will be an 800 number you can call when your car becomes sentient.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9596258"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9596258</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https://wiki.gandi.net/en/hosting/gandi-expert/change-root-passwd-in-expert-mode"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.gandi.net/en/hosting/gandi-expert/change-root-p...</a>",1437876214

9949828,comment,9899866,9900306,0,0,aaronwall,,,"The assertion is 100% correct.<p>There are other reports out there & some of them do great breakdowns of click volume, click costs, click values & so on ... based on things like: device type (desktop vs tablet vs cell phones, or even across operating systems), branded keywords vs unbranded keywords, text ads vs PLAs/shopping ads, etc.<p>There are many such reports, but the SEM company which regularly puts out the best report on this front is RKG (which was bought out by Merkle last year <a href=""http://www.merkleinc.com/news-and-events/press-releases/2014/merkle-acquires-search-digital-marketing-agency-rkg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.merkleinc.com/news-and-events/press-releases/2014...</a> and even after the buyout is still putting out great reports each quarter).<p>RKG&#x27;s most recent report is downloadable here <a href=""http://www.rimmkaufman.com/digital-marketing-report/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rimmkaufman.com/digital-marketing-report/</a> & it is something I read (and recommend) every quarter. :)<p>In the report, they stated they saw Google dramatically increase minimum CPC on own brand keywords over the past year, that brand keyword cost was up 39% YoY, and that Google was now charging brands more for clicks on their own brand terms than Bing does. You can see a quick review of their report here\n<a href=""http://searchengineland.com/us-paid-search-growing-but-at-slower-rate-google-brand-cpcs-surge-report-225348"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchengineland.com/us-paid-search-growing-but-at-sl...</a><p>And there might be multiple factors in Google showing fewer ads. Some general assertions and/or hypothesis on potential drivers...<p>A rise in minimum CPCs on brand keywords might block out some of the lower value 3rd party arbitrage on the branded terms, Google might be showing larger ads (with more ad extensions) above the organic results & fewer ads in the right sidebar, some categories might have PLAs / shopping ads performing so strong that there is less need for text ads, in some categories (like hotel search) Google has effectively turned much of the &quot;organic&quot; search result set into another layer of ads via their hotel price ads, Google includes affiliate links in their knowledge graph, over time more of Google&#x27;s search volume is on mobile devices with a smaller SERP interface & no right rail to show ads in, over time more of Google&#x27;s search volume is in emerging markets with less shallower and less mature ad markets, etc etc etc<p>A few other things worth mentioning on their general economic trends: on smaller devices partners (outside of the big one in Apple) are easier for Google to squeeze out & represent a smaller share of Google&#x27;s ad revenues, over the last couple years the partner network keeps comprising a smaller percent of Google&#x27;s overall ad revenue (numerous sources on this front, like <a href=""http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2013/10/analysis_what_future.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2013/10/anal...</a> & <a href=""http://blog.pagefair.com/2014/adsense-smoking-gun/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.pagefair.com/2014/adsense-smoking-gun/</a> ), Google is getting higher revenue from clicks on Google.com & their regional search properties but the YouTube pre-roll ads generally go for less money (since they are earlier in the consumer funnel than search is & have less intent than a search does) & drag down the aggregate click price (because Google counts YouTube video ad views as clicks).<p>One other thing worth mentioning in terms of mobile is that while the mobile click values (and thus CPCs) are lower, Google offsets that by dominating the mobile interface with ads. 3 years back I wrote this post <a href=""http://www.seobook.com/mobile-seo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seobook.com/mobile-seo</a> highlighting how Google had over double the CTR on mobile search ads as they did on desktop search ads.

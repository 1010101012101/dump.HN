4370552,comment,4369111,4370209,1,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>Your phone is 90% of the time a mini Internet tablet, not a portable version of a land-line phone.</i><p>Your phone might be. Mine isn't.<p><i>The privacy issue isn't just theoretical.</i><p>No, I agree, it's not. In fact, I'm an active campaigner for privacy in various ways, and I don't share my life with on-line social networks for privacy reasons.<p>However, it's easy to get into a black-and-white mindset that values only complete privacy and assumes no value at all otherwise, which I don't think is helpful. Of all the ways someone could technically spy on me if they had the resources to do it, monitoring the location of my mobile phones is unlikely to be what causes me problems.<p>We are in an interesting and potentially dangerous time at the moment, because it's been too long since a mass of people all suffered due to a major invasion of their privacy. It is easy to dismiss the creeping invasions we see with things like CCTV, monitoring of the Internet and telecomms services, and social networking sites asking for ever more personal information, when these aren't yet causing serious consequences to most people. And of course, people often give up that information voluntarily because it benefits them in some way that they value more than any perceived intrusion. Privacy isn't about withholding data entirely, it's about controlling who know what and how they can use that information.<p>I think the pendulum will swing back in a few years, though things will get worse before they start to get better. As people start to find that they really can't get jobs because of some minor indiscretion, or that their credit rating is damaged, or that they simply can't get complete health insurance because they know too many people at a high risk of some lifestyle-related condition, social norms recognising the importance of privacy and the political climate that follows will rein in the likes of Facebook and Google. All that convenience won't look quite so cost-free any more. I also don't see the kind of abuses we see by governments, for example the excessively personal searches at places like airports, continuing indefinitely. These measures are unpleasant, and no matter how much the airlines/governments stick their heads in the sand publicly, the fact is that it puts some people off flying and that costs those airlines/governments some of their profits/taxes.<p>At the rate things are going -- even 10 years ago, Google were the new kid on the block and Facebook didn't even exist yet -- I don't think it will take 20 years for this to happen. The abuses (and resulting concerns) are already starting, and we're already starting to see savvy politicians try to get ahead of the curve on things like blocking employers from demanding to see their employees'/applicants' private social network content. The security theatre and government intrusion is getting tiresome, and ever more expensive at a time when the global economy isn't exactly doing well.<p>In short, I think far more powerful social pressures than open source software are going to be what preserves useful privacy and establishes new social norms for what is and isn't acceptable behaviour in the era of the Internet and big data mining. Open source may provide a valuable tool for audit purposes and watching the watchers to keep them honest, but it's only one tool in the box.",1344706970

To the latter half, I mean, not the former.  HN sees posts of more or less this type (the ""make an essentially meaningless metaphor and see how far we can push it"" type) quite often, plays with it for at most a couple weeks, and then forgets it ever happens.  The ""taking [it] seriously"" you see here is likely to be that case again: HNers like playing around with basically any classification that anyone presents (cf. the math/corn post where even I felt compelled to throw in a quick comment) and then moving on to the next classification system someone presents.  It doesn't mean they're going to now make all of their life decisions based on the classification of the week; it's just a bit of harmless fun.<p>Now, it's true that sometimes this does spread and gets to really silly levels but I see no reason to suspect that this is going to be in that camp rather than the ""harmless fun"" area.",1344706641

Although, as a group they always survive, while the hangers on and various big guys sometimes don't.<p>That's nitpicky though, I didn't mean to imply that there isn't/won't be significant damage to artists livelihoods, just that the damage to society and everyone else is greater if we continue down the road to the panopticon society necessary to continue to enforce our current copyright system.<p>> if they provide a better incentive than copyright, and almost no-one does<p>It's hard to beat a large scale monopoly distribution scheme. It's entirely possible that artists won't be able to make as much money under any new system as they did in the current one. Maybe there will be lowers highs and higher lows as the business moves away from being so hit-oriented. The one thing that's almost certain is that the distribution of music revenue among artists will be different, I find it more likely that the new technologies influence will be to flatten that distribution. Like you said, Kickstarter is a good example of an experiment that would do this if it does succeed.<p>I also agree that no one has figured out how to make blockbuster movies without a distribution monopoly to fund it, and they might never figure it out. Our generation's era of movies would probably be considered a bit of a golden age for high cost spectacle, like the old studio system was for serials and creating hollywood royalty.<p>> The trouble is, if we don't pull it off, those new business models are going to be things like always-online DRM schemes and locked-down hardware and walled garden app stores. Exactly none of these things ultimately results in better experiences for the public. They just happen to have defensible bottom lines for the businesses.<p>This is a good point, taking the path to locked-down hardware and DRM is an escape route that the existing industry can take/is taking. On reflection I agree, anti-SOPA/anti-surveillance sentiment pushes the industry to ramp up what Doctorow called <i>the coming war on general purpose computation</i>. Depressing thought, but at least some of the ideals that would motivate people to stop one will also motivate them to stop the other.

Here are two key paragraphs from his post, with just a few words searched & replaced so the text refers to ""entrepreneurs"" instead of ""mathematicians:""<p><i>Even if one dismisses the notion of genius, it is still the case that at any given point in time, some entrepreneurs are faster, more experienced, more knowledgeable, more efficient, more careful, or more creative than others. This does not imply, though, that only the best entrepreneurs should start companies; this is the common error of mistaking absolute advantage for comparative advantage. The number of interesting business opportunities and problems to work on is vast  far more than can be covered in detail just by the best entrepreneurs, and sometimes the set of tools or ideas that you have will find something that other good entrepreneurs have overlooked, especially given that even the greatest entrepreneurs still have weaknesses in some aspects of business. As long as you have education, interest, and a reasonable amount of talent, there will be some market opportunity where you can make a solid and useful contribution. It might not be the most glamorous idea, but actually this tends to be a healthy thing; in many cases the mundane nuts-and-bolts ideas turn out to actually be more important than fancy ones. Also, it is necessary to cut ones teeth on the non-glamorous parts of a field before one really has any chance at all to tackle hard problems; take a look at the early efforts of any of todays great entrepreneurs to see what I mean by this.<p>In some cases, an abundance of raw talent may end up (somewhat perversely) to actually be harmful for ones long-term professional development; if success comes too easily, for instance, one may not put as much energy into working hard, asking dumb questions, or increasing ones range, and thus may eventually cause ones skills to stagnate. Also, if one is accustomed to easy success, one may not develop the patience necessary to deal with truly difficult challenges.

498992,comment,498839,498948,0,0,Retric,,,"Videos like that are a clear sign of a company that can't innovate. Creating a video like that suggests Microsoft's ""creative"" people are not really part of the design processes and the company has no idea what to do with them.  And those ""Creative"" people don't understand what makes useful advances vs. art.<p>None of those ""products"" would be that hard to prototype today, but the interfaces are just not that useful.  Take that screen shot capture in the meeting.  Now outlook or some location aware system could keep track of where people are and link to the meeting notes, but no they want to guess where you're eyes are and figure out where the screen is ect.  It's different, but not useful.",1235917393

It is not tied to Linux kernel because it built for (patched) Fuse. With Infiniband hardware, it is fastest clustered system available for free.

498989,comment,498921,498921,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I think all 'free' online ranking sites give you data that you should take with a large grain of salt. You can use some of them for relative comparisons but not if the comparison is a close one.<p>Another use is to extrapolate from 'known' numbers to an unknown site (say a competitor).<p>It helps to separate truth from bull, but it is definitely not an exact measurement. If someone is off by a factor of 10 then you're on solid ground to call bull, if it is a factor of 2 or less then it gets a lot harder.",1235916947

498987,comment,498910,498956,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Techcrunch is indeed pretty nasty sometimes, and I have criticised them here before, but it would be utterly ridiculous if hacker news, a news site for startups, banned one of the preeminent startup blogs.<p>Techcrunch is influential and as such it is relevant for many people here. You can ban a site that is nasty and irrelevant, but you cannot ban a very relevant site just because some articles are odious.<p>Banning should not be about morals, but rather about usefulness.",1235916531

By that I mean do we want all networks to behave in the same way, do we want all devices to be represented by their lowest common denominator?<p>Essentially creating this specific hypervisor OS would create a lot of places for leaky abstractions, and you'd end up creating a lot more special case code to detect and fix those abstractions then you would if you just coded the drivers.",1235916353

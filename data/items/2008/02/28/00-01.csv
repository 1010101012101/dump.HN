125132,comment,124605,124605,0,0,michjeanty,,,"Regardless if you're bootstrapping, or get outside funding, an early startup should always bootstrap. Bootstrap to me is to spend every dollar bill like it was your last. Now, when you start a startup, you won't have time to cook (good way to save money, but not good way to save time), instead you can spend that time coding. Going to a restaurant is out of the window (way too expensive). The best way to save money, and save time is to buy pre-cooked food. I think noodle is the best in that case. I love noodles; just throw it in the microwave for 2 minutes, and it's ready. You can even eat it while you're coding. Trust me I've experienced it before. Noddle will save you time and money.<p>good luck!",1204160137

If we eliminated our military, for example, there would instantly be a 100% surplus as the military accounts for about 50% of the fuel this country uses.  As for why we abstract energy with bills, it's because people are easier to control that way.  Plus you need to account for the not to easy to calculate idea of ""human energy"" represented by money.  If China's population doubles, bankers can increase the money supply to account for their economic activity - to a point.  But how can we increase the energy ""things"" to do that?  A bit harder.",1204160082

The more I learn about life, the more I appreciate everyone around me more.  I'm sure lots of people underestimate civil engineers, car designers, pilots, surgeons, micro-biologists, etc. because life is complex and we have no idea how challenging people's contributions are and how they affect us.  Having said that, IMHO it's usually hackers who underestimate everyone else's contributions ... until they get to the point where nobody's signing up for their ""thing"" or they have people sign up, but nobody's willing to pay them for it.  THEN the value of business models, marketing expertise, sales techniques, etc. come into perspective, when they realize all the tweaking in the world doesn't necessarily translate into the handing over of the cash from paying customers.",1204159113

That will really help bring thing about much more efficiently.  Tell me, once you're done with your product, do you see yourself going to a VC for funding only to have the VC tell you in return, ""You want money from me?  Well, I don't know - if you're willing to spend years learning how to raise money from institutional investors all over the world, I might be willing to look at your proposal, otherwise, well, it's not worth it for me.""<p>Maybe you need a CEO with relevant experience.  I hope the people who you approach turn around and tell you, ""Gee, you're a noob when it comes to building/growing/managing a business - tell you what, why don't you first invest some time and become an executive at a Fortune 500 company like me, then I'll consider helping you out by adding my credibility to your ""startup"" which is basically just a bunch of code.

125106,comment,120843,120972,0,0,NSX2,,,">> Having ideas and being a user in your target market doesn't cut the mustard IMO. And an early stage team doesn't need a project manager, or detailed spec sheets, or other ""manager-y"" stuff.<p>I predict you'll fail with whatever you try to startup AS LONG AS you have this attitude.  A founder who used to be a former user and can point to the flaws in everything on the market and came up with a better solution is an IDEAL person to have start something.  Their intuition is based on their experience of what people like them (ie, former customers) will PAY MONEY for.  That's a business.  Hackers hacking all night is not a business.  Sorry to burst your bubble.<p>You can't be more wrong.  You only get PRACTICAL, USEFULL business ideas AS a customer/user.  That's why 99.99% of programmers who start businesses flop - they're so wrapped up in some tiny aspect of their warped reality and how their awesome code makes a tiny part of it a bit better in ways nobody understands, that they never stop and think that 99.99% of the general population of who they think will be their customers couldn't care less.<p>That's if they even bother to think about who their customers will be.  Most programmers can't think beyond ""users"" and I'm sorry, but now that we're entering recession times, you'll learn really quick that users does NOT equal same as paying customer.<p>The sad truth for you is that most successful companies were started by people without the technical skills but who were users of many things, had a ""big picture perspective"" and thought to themselves, ""You know what sucks about the current state of things, this, this and that - someone should make something different like this and this.""<p>Otherwise, from your model, you just have programmers making something most likely nobody will care about.  That's not a company, that's code.  If you get some users, that may a service, by which I mean of the charity kind.  If they pay you, that's a product, though not necessarily a successful company.<p>HERE - FORGET MY THESIS - imagine instead this scenario - let's say all the ""big idea"" people went on some Atlas shrugged type of strike.  That leaves you programmers in boston, and those in virginia, in New York, S.V, and about a hundred million others in Russia, Eastern Europe, India, China, Netherlands, Ireland, France ...<p>If the idea people are that irrelevant to starting great companies, and programmers are that all-important, why don't you guys all get together, form some sort of super development virtual company and spit out 50 million uber-companies all based on your awesome code?<p>I'll bet 50 idea people in various industries will start successful companies that MAKE MONEY for every 1 programmer with a brilliant algorithm to load YouTube videos 2% faster or whatever passes for a great business idea among hackers these days that manages to fool some desperate, inexperienced VC to put money into their project.<p>FINAL ANALYSIS: Masons build, but building without a good plan leads to well-executed crap.  No inspired architect/designer, no beauty, no inspirational ""thing"" that PAYING customers can wrap their minds around.  I've said it before and I'll say it again: just because you get ""users"" and maybe bought out by Mega-Corp. doesn't mean you've created a successful company.  Get people to pay you money for your thing, that's a business.  Otherwise, just a delusion that will never survive the next 4 years of economic slowdown.  Can't figure out how to make people hand over their money for your ""thing""?  That's where you need ""business idea"" people who've honed their intuition from using everything in the market.",1204158011

125098,comment,120843,120955,0,0,NSX2,,,"Don't take this the wrong way ... but I've had an inside perspective on how investors (who actually write checks, not blog articles about how cool they are) think.  You'd be shocked to discover what little value they place on your code.  And investors are not even the most important part of starting a business - customers are.  They could care even less than investors do.  If coding was that all-important, why doesn't every hacker code their way to multi-million dollar success stories?  IF ONLY STARTING A BUSINESS was as easy as you say.  I've been and am in a similar position, have come across COUNTLESS ""hackers"" with their own pet project, and coming up now a little over a year after they've all turned me down, amazingly, nobody cares about their excellent code - just like a year ago, and probably a year from now.  Yes, product development is important.  But alone it gets you nowhere.  You need communication skills, ability to motivate during hard times, ability to redirect hostility and stress found at many startups, ability to sense people's needs (for example, most people I've ever met that write more checks than blogs about themselves as investors usually have manic-depressive natures and are looking for the ""high"" of being involved in something cool/worthwile/humanitarian/state-of-the-art).  You need awesome design skills, ability present information in ways that make sense to non-technical users.  You need ability to document work processes that keep everybody current and on-track.  You need to be able to follow massive amounts of information to figure out who is likely to enter your space and where your space might branch off 6 months / a year etc.  You need the ability to quickly figure out countless people and pitch them on their secret desires, not your startup.  You need to be able to respond to massive, systematic changes in the market that can render your entire business model useless and be able to quickly figure out a whole new business from scratch that can still be built with dwindling resources.  You need to be able to write countless business plans at a moment's notice in case you get interest from who knows where who knows when.  You need to be able to figure out how to cheaply or freely market to your customers while overcoming a decade's worth of internet-enabled skepticism.  TELL ME, who the hell is doing all of these things and countless more things I forgot to mention while you're busy coding?  Or do you plan on doing these things ""after you're done"" coding?  If so, how can you compete with a startup that has people doing all these things WHILE their programmers code?<p>""Great deal for you.""  If someone does years of market research, comes up with a clever way to make money and beat potential competitors and figures out a way to get money to finance the project, you think it's a ""great deal for them"" if they get 50% of a company they start while a hacker hacks, as if though the hacker is doing them a favor?  Do you have any idea how many 1-person hacker companies trying to sell their ""product"" (ie, code) with no users to a larger company I have come across while looking for programmers for my startup effort?  As much as you may hate hearing this, remember all those snobby ivy-league MBAs during the dot-com bust that thought they were a gift to the rest of us, you know, the ones hackers hate?\nYou've replaced them.  You're the next version of them, and 10 years from now I guarantee you as the dollar falls and your value to the market is reduced exponentially as more and more eastern-european/chinese/indians are graduating with PHDs and work histories for major overseas companies starting from even high school all the way through their grad programs, I guarantee you you will be replaced by another class that will recall, ""Remember the days a decade ago when programmers thought they were God's gift to the world just because they could do what a billion foreigners with better educations can do just as well, or better these days?""

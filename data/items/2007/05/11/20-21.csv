Will you see that in me-too frameworks?  Will they ever do more than copy ideas and stay a step behind?<p>Plus, the difference between a dynamic language and java is  something like the difference between travelling at light-speed, vs. faster than light.  In Java you travel (code) in a straight line. In Rails or a dynamic language, you can fold space-time so the destination point is only a few lines of code from where you are now.  Cleverness gives you more leverage in a dynamic language.  ROR is solid enough, and Jruby can run rails now.<p>Eric\n",1178917137
21438,comment,21316,21416,0,0,mojuba,,,"Spam was never absolutely useless (except those special messages that check your address for availability), and some people do buy fake Rolex watches or cheap viagra pills. These offers may or may not be legal, and that's a different kind of problem. Unsolicited mail can be useful to someone, or otherwise it wouldn't exist at all.<p>The real problem with spam, again, is that you will always receive it unless you clearly define what's important for you, or maybe what's not important - either way. Is that possible?",1178917101

21436,comment,21413,21414,0,0,Tichy,,,"I am just considering giving up my exploration of Grails.<p>A lot of it seems like fun, but I am not sure if it is mature yet. My progress was very slow because nothing comes natural to me anymore. At the moment I don't know how ""save"" cascades in GORM. Maybe I am just not made for the Rails type of programming: seems I want to be in control of everything. With Hibernate, I can explicitly define the cascades, plus it is very easy to find out what to do in the documentation.<p>To be fair you can probably fall back to configuring Hibernate directly with Grails. I think I would rather have a classic Spring/Hibernate application and replace some parts with Groovy/Grails than the other way round. One thing I also don't like is that Grails doesn't use Maven (or gaven or whatever they will call the groovy replacement for maven they will surely eventually create). I am used to not putting binary libraries into subversion any more and don't want to go back.<p>My other source of frustration is that I couldn't get my grails application to run in Eclipse and therefore I couldn't debug. Also the Groovy plugin is extremly basic, all it does is syntax highlighting, for all I can tell (and debugging, if it would work). Also, Grails produces the longest exception stacktraces I have ever seen, looking for the source of the error in there is no fun.<p>I feel a bit pathetic - surely I should try harder and dig deeper into Grails, but somehow I can't motivate myself to do it.<p>That said, I still think it would be 1000 times more fun than classical Java development. I guess I'll just wait for a few version jumps and then I'll try it again. Wish I could find the time to contribute to grails myself.",1178916699

And yes, I read that article.<p>Self-learning algorithms suck, because they are not intelligent. Even if you had a human spam filter and you had to teach him/her what's important for you, even that kind of filter would give you false positives from time to time.<p>The whole Bayesian filtering business was doomed to failure for very obvious reasons.",1178916533

It really boils down to whether you think a centralized government can better allocate your dollars to your benefit, or whether you can.<p>You could certainly make an argument that people would free ride and/or greatly underestimate the benefit that spending 10 cents of each dollar on (say) the military or roads would provide, and this furthermore justifies taking that 10 cents by force as part of the price of membership in a community.<p>However, I personally find it less persuasive to argue that centralized allocation programs will produce greater wealth than distributed ones. A remote government simply doesn't have all the information and can't know your preferences.<p>One thing I find interesting is that many people can come to fairly good agreement on what the problem is (bad economy, low unemployment, etc.) but disagree very dramatically on what the solution should be. frossie is likely a Keynesian and rick888 is probably a Hayekian; in my experience, Keynesianism is in the water supply and the ""default belief"" for most college graduates, but most entrepreneurs tend to end up Hayekian:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0nERTFo-Sk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0nERTFo-Sk</a>",1282175283

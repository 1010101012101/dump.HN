It feels like someone is sticking their middle finger up at you. :) And that is what is at issue; we are potentially building a culture where people expect stuff for free and businesses are expected to earn revenue in other ways - to the point that people will take it anyway and to hell with what you think.

Menstrual cups, an alternative to tampons/pads, can be left in for a recommended max of 12 hours, but I'm sure there are women that use it for far longer without removal and any problems.<p>There was a past where IUDs and tampons (not even just high-absorbency, but the materials used for certain ones...) caused TSS and more, and the risk factor is still kinda there, but nowadays it's almost unheard of. And just keeping something in a vagina doesn't mean it's about to turn into a toxic breeding ground like it did in the past.

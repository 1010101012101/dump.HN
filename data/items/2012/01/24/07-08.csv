Companies should realize by now that engineers are not dumb.  We can play the game and negotiate hard to get the salary we deserve.<p>But my question to companies is, are you really just that stupid?  Every company should know that an engineer is an investment in time.  It takes months, maybe a year for an engineer to learn how the company works and be productive.  Many years in the domain and the company to go from productive to enhancing and improving the business.  It's not just about coding.  It's also the relationships you build up within the company that makes an engineer increasingly more and more effective the longer they are there.<p>So you manage to trick an engineer and hire him way before market rate.  You save a few thousand a year doing so, maybe tens of thousands.  You really think they're not going to find out pretty quickly?  There's so much salary data out there.  And what do you think they're going to do when they find out?  They will hate you, make plans to leave, and tell all their friends that you are scum who pay below market.  All that time you invested in the engineer?  Gone.  Your reputation in the job market?  Gone.  Your ability to be agile and adapt to business needs?  Gone.  Eventually your company?  Gone.<p>Was that really worth saving a few thousands per year?  Just skip the stupid salary game and give a fair salary.  It's the smart thing to do from a business perspective.",1327391441

However, that is way too high of a spread at that point of the negotiation to be a feasible discussion (the candidate should have been submitted at $90-$105, or $95-$110,000).<p>If the company is sold on the candidate, it is feasible for the recruiter to negotiate another $10,000. If the company has other options or isn't clamoring, you may lose the offer.<p>But, most recruiters are bunk, and the difference between $80,000 and $95,000 can be a breakdown in the offer being pulled, ergo the ""real estate"" example of closing the deal at a lower price (salary) and cost of losing it all together.

Now this ceo is quite a nice person, so please don't think that I think poorly of him.  Somehow, salaries came up and the ceo mentioned that we were all presumably doing pretty well.  Then one of my engineer coworkers mentioned he was paying $2300 or something like that in rent for a small one bedroom near Valencia and 20th, and I said my gf and I were paying $2600 for a medium one bedroom in upper haight.  The ceo was utterly shocked at what rent prices were, since he'd moved to the city and bought a house nearly 30 years before.  It turns out he was paying something like $1300/mo to live in a mansion in pac heights and his mortgage was almost paid off.  The thing that bugged me, in retrospect, was his lack of awareness of one of the primary drivers of engineering salaries: the cost of living in sf.  And the impact of the city being actively hostile to tearing down a lot of the pretty crummy housing we have and building up.<p>edit: not to mention, if you perhaps want to own, $500 - $600K in most of SF is not exactly living in luxury.  If you're near real public transport, ie bart, it's a small one bedroom and if you resign yourself to a crappy commute or driving it's a lower end two bedroom, 700-1100 ft^2.  Further, you'll pay $1.1k per million dollars of value per month in taxes, so for a $600k house you're giving the city nearly $700/mo for forever.",1327390596

You have to charge <i>significantly</i> more to account for just the direct costs of your employment (such as payroll tax, half of which is salary that every employee has but is unaware of) and the benefits package.  Basically, you get to pay your own fully loaded costs.  $74 an hour at 40 hour weeks gets you a package similar to that enjoyed by an salaried engineer at $80k to $90k or so.<p>You also tend to charge more than even that calculation suggests, because you're responsible for downtime, overhead in getting new gigs between clients, credit risk, yadda yadda.  The upshot is that you'd probably have a contracting rate in the low three figures.  (They do, of course, go up from there.)",1327389898

Some clients are simply going to walk away and you're going to be left without payment, so such a strategy makes sense.

The Court only partially decides whether the government can engage in GPS tracking without a warrant.<p>In order to determine whether the government violates the 4th Amendment, the Court must answer two questions.  (1) Did the government activity (i.e., attaching GPS tracker to a car) qualify as a ""search"" or ""seizure""?  (2) If so, was the search or seizure reasonable?<p>In the Jones case, the Court ONLY answered the first question, because the government based its entire case on the argument that attaching a GPS tracker is not a search.  The Court found that attaching a GPS tracker to a car does indeed qualify as a search, but did not determine under what circumstances it might be reasonable to conduct such a search without a warrant.  So, in a future case, the court might determine that it is reasonable to search (i.e., attach a GPS tracker) without a warrant because, for example, the car might be moved before the warrant could be approved.  In fact, it is already the case that cars can be searched without warrants in many cases where houses, personal belongings, etc. cannot be.<p>(Note that the Court uses the phrase ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" extensively, but this actually has nothing to do with the reasonableness of the search.

3503786,comment,3503574,3503574,1,0,nabilt,,,"No advice for these types of chairs, but I have been researching programming chairs recently.<p>I spent 2 hours in the store sitting on Herman Miller, Humanscale and Knoll. I've come to the conclusion that if you are going to work on a computer all day the most important feature is configurability. The perfect position is slightly reclined (seat as well not just the back) with a keyboard tray and a monitor arm. I think the entire package is needed otherwise you won't be comfortable. I had this type of setup at my previous job and it was great. After I started working from home I didn't want to spend the money to build a proper work environment, but that changed when I started getting leg pains. I know nothing replaces getting up every hour or so, but it can alleviate the discomfort.<p>I've tried the lazy boy type of chair and the problem with that is you are stuck in 1 or 2 positions forever. After a while I find myself curled up or sitting in an awkward position because of my need to fidget. This is why I've settled on the Aeron from Herman Miller and am in the process of buying it. The mesh seat removes the pressure point from my legs, the entire chair reclines spreading the weight to my back and it has lots of options. I actually liked the  Embody a bit more, but couldn't justify the price. Humanscale has some great chairs as well, but I found they didn't feel as good when you recline.<p>Summery, I plan to get the following in order of importance: (1) Good reclining chair (2) configurable keyboard tray (3) monitor arm (4) motorized desk so I can stand and work once in a while.",1327388567

5722904,comment,5720945,5722666,4,0,nzonbi,,,"Adobe Flex was also completely based on this ""components"" model. I would say that it is a useful approach, but as you suggest, not without its pitfalls. Adobe mxml was pretty much the same as this is: xml based markup, with custom components, these in turn implemented in a combination of mxml markup, AS3 scripts and css styles. I was a flex early adopter, and used it for some years. Later I abandoned it, mostly because I got tired of writing excessive boilerplate code in java-styled AS3, and also because html started to evolve. I can remember some tips. Please excuse my diffuse language, I am talking straight from memory.<p>- Avoid messy component structures. Keep component definitions simple. Use components hierarchies and keep nesting levels simple.<p>- On complex UIs, ""application intention"" can get lost in a sea of anonymous data bindings. Use good documentations practices. Avoid data binding spaghetti.<p>- On complex UIs, Use good planing for data binding. Because debugging it is ""data binding hell"".<p>- Know your components well. Sometimes components capabilities may differ slightly from what you are trying to accomplish. Trying to go against the components quirks, can be very expensive.<p>- Data binding is not the panacea. There are scenarios that are best served with other approaches.",1368770112

5722886,comment,5720945,5722075,3,0,straws,,,"The web is still for documents. It's for a resource that lives at a URL. It's markup, not programming, and that's the very reason it has lived to be twenty years old and the main way that information is communicated. It's how we're able to hold this conversation right now  people are comfortable stitching together words in XML-ish constructs.<p>The people making games, applications, and lush webGL marketing demos are people who can throw lots of engineering resources at a problem until it does the thing they want it to do. Web dev has always been an insane mountain of hacks in order to get pages to render, but the attractive and democratic reasoning is that that extra effort is worth it if the maximum number of people can access the information. People on old computers, cheap smartphones, kindles, chumbys, whatever. The best computer is the one you have on you, that sort of thing. Access and ease-of-adoption are powerful things.<p>So that's why I see web components as something that enables people writing markup more than it empowers people writing giant javascript applications. This is so that people can add <twitter-tweet href=""twitter.com/name"">My Cool Tweet</twitter-tweet> tags to their wordpress blogs, and so that the people making that <twitter-tweet> tag can be confident that it will render and not look horrible on that person's blog. It's so that the complex, app-ish things can be abstracted away and added to documents with a declarative and logic-less syntax.<p>No amount of java applets would have ever made up for that.",1368769640

Everything else is an excuse.<p>If you choose the former, it should start with a frank but non-confrontational conversation among all of you where you discuss what is and isn't working with your relationship.  Don't overfocus on the business.  The day-to-day of a startup grows from the relationship among the co-founders.  That's always at the root.<p>For example, if the business model isn't working, why don't you have a relationship where you can say ""Guys, this business model isn't working.  We have to do something different.  Let's figure this out.""?  Over-focusing on the business will result in a laundry-list conversation when everyone just unloads their grievances all at once.  It's not productive.<p>If going into the conversation you feel the urge to let your co-founders ""have a piece of your mind"" then don't have the conversation.  You need to be calm, in control, and aware of the real source of your own frustrations.<p>Most likely there's a long series of missed-but-unstated expectations, both big and small.  You have to acknowledge your own responsibility in this situation, viz., as a co-founder you have a responsibility to bring these up the second they happen to avoid a ""blow up"" situation. Yet here you are, in just such a situation.  You're partially responsible for that, whether your co-founders are actually idiots or not.<p>You have to be prepared for your co-founders to feel similarly about you.  Avoid the trap of allowing the conversation to become a tit for tat.  ""You forgot to publish that blog post.""  ""Yeah, well, you forgot to follow up with a potential investor!"" etc.<p>It might help to reframe this conversation from one where you're going to tell them all the things that aren't working to one where you ask for help with the things you think aren't working.  If you don't want your co-founders to be defensive then you need to be vulnerable -- probably much more vulnerable than you're comfortable being.<p>Good luck.  Welcome to startups.",1368769063

You might as well be talking about Billy Bob's Hardware Depot, with over ten thousand customers served in 5 counties.<p>""If people don't actually hold dollars and just change their bitcoins into dollars when they need to pay taxes...""<p>Sounds like businesses will find a way to save money (and thus be more competitive) by avoiding the cost of converting between currencies and demanding USD up front (or penalizing customers who use Bitcoin, as many businesses already do with customers who use credit cards).  There is also the matter of legal tender law:  an American business cannot (legally) refuse to take payment in USD, but nobody is obligated to accept Bitcoin.  It would take a breakdown of law enforcement in the USA, at a fundamental level, to make the situation you described possible.<p>"">USD is backed by the law: tax laws, debt laws, torts, fines, fees, etc.<p>Right. Nothing, in other words. The same was true for the Zimbabwe dollar until they gave up.""<p>If you think the law amounts to ""nothing,"" then go ahead and ignore it.  Don't bother with your taxes.  Refuse to take USD payments and demand only Bitcoin.  Put your money where your mouth is.<p>Take a brief look at what happened to the Zimbabwe dollar in 2008.  Hyperinflation was certainly the primary problem, but the last step in the failure of the currency <i>was the government's inability to enforce the law</i>.  People were illegally conducting business using foreign currency, and the government was unable to stop them.  People ignored price freezes and illegally adjusted the prices of goods throughout the day.  Ultimately, the government ""gave up"" and repealed laws that people were not bothering to follow.<p>You would have to be delusional to think that the US is even remotely near such a situation, or to even think that there are signs that such a situation will occur any time soon.<p>""The biggest obstacle to adoption is the fact that you can't hold a bitcoin in your hand. But if that mental block was overcome people could switch over very quickly.""<p>That is not just a mental block.

5722843,comment,5721653,5722654,6,0,oblique63,,,"Now, I find myself to be a pretty darn introverted mofo internally (I line up perfectly as a full-out INTP on the Myers-Briggs scale if that means anything to anybody), but I've found that socializing is just as useful of a skill as programming or playing a musical instrument. Sure, I find it to be significantly more tiring than either of those two activities, and I'm not nearly as proficient at it as I'd like to be, but it is a <i>skill</i> -- not some distant genetic trait that you might be hopeless to turn on -- therefore, it can be at least somewhat learned. The issue then is just about wanting to learn it.<p>I'm not about to be condescending about it and suggest something along the lines of ""if you really cared/wanted it bad enough... blah blah blah"", because I find statements like that to be annoying and unhelpful. I merely wish to bring awareness.  Learning is a skill, and equivalently but more to the point: learning how to learn any specific skill, is a skill.  It is OK to be inexperienced in this area, we all start off this way; it is merely <i>being aware</i> of this situation that seems to set mindsets apart. This inability to learn a skill that involves ""looking like an idiot"" as <i>part of the learning process</i>, signals inexperience with learning skills that require noticeable/major discomfort to acquire. And again, that is OK -- it makes total sense. The thing to realize is, that is all it is: discomfort. It's not really 'dangerous' regardless of how much it feels that way, it's just as benign (and possibly as annoying to some people) as developing callusus on your fingers to play guitar. It's a bit of a painful process, and you really can't get into the 'flow' of playing for extended periods of time until you develop them, which requires building up the calluses in baby steps; because otherwise you'd just be cutting up and burning your fingers up trying to go any longer. So if it helps at all, just look at it as building up 'social calluses'. It'll hurt, yeah, I acknowledge that. But hey, that's what's involved if you wan't to learn how to play. I mean, You might prefer to learn other instruments like piano because they doesn't involve this painful step, and you might get pretty darn good at pickup up those other instruments, but at the end of the day, you still wouldn't have learned how to play the guitar.<p>As for the depression, I've been completely and deeply suicidal many a time in my short life (used to be an annual tradition practically), and I really can't give you a quick answer for it unfortunately. The best thing I found is to just keep busy, but you seem to have discovered that strategy on your own already, so kudos! I know it took me a while... I believe there are many reliable findings about meditation reducing depression+anxiety (possibly as a result of its regenerative abilities with regards to 'willpower'), but meditation is really just an intense exercise in attention. And attention I believe, has also been found to invoke a state of anxiolytic relaxation. Therefore, keeping busy makes sense as an anti-depressive mechanism.  I wish I could produce some sources on this, but I'm already procrastinating quite badly on a paper I need to have done in about an hour, I just felt I needed to leave a response here before I forgot.

5722774,comment,5720196,5720791,2,0,KMag,,,"Others have rightly mentioned HMAC as being a good option, but being approximately equal to the work of the CBC encryption.<p>There are peer-reviewed standard cipher modes that provide a cryptographic checksum with a low overhead per block plus one extra block cipher operation per message.  These are generally known as single-pass authenticated encryption modes.  GCM mode is probably your best option.  If you're willing to rekey every 64 GB, are releasing your code under an OSI-approved Open Source license, and you're okay using a mode that's patented, OCB mode is another option.<p>Really, you don't want to use a static key.  Ideally you'd either use the shared master key just to provide confidentiality (in case ECDH is broken) and authentication for ECDH session key agreement.  Failing that, you'd use the shared master key and the current time to generate the session encryption keys in order to limit the amount of traffic under a given session key that an attacker can use.<p>session_counter = (AES256_enc(master_key, 0) + time()) | 0x0FFF; session_key = AES256_enc(master_key, session_counter); will generate for you a 128-bit key that changes every 1.13 hours (2^12 seconds).  If an attacker can notice some traffic pattern that gives away when the rekey happens, this will give away the lower 12 bits of AES256_enc(master_key, 0), but this is very little plain text to work with.  Note that due to the | 0x0FFF, it's impossible to accidentally use the leaked bits in a session key by using AES256_enc(master, 0) as a session key.  If you want a 256-bit session key, it's best to use a second 256-bit shared key to encrypt session_counter to generate the second 128-bit half of your session key.  Of course, in practice you'd pre-calculate when the session_counter rolls over rather than recomputing the session key for every packet.  You either live with data being lost a few seconds every hour, synchronize clocks very well using GPS or NTP, or else calculate two sets of session keys and use the MACs to figure out which key the sender is using.  When using two sets of session keys, you'd throw away the ""expired"" key and calculate the ""upcoming"" key 2^11 seconds after session_counter rolls over.  (That is, you actually roll your pair of session keys half out of phase of when you'd roll a single session key.)<p>Edit: Changed to use C's xor operator for exponentiation since Python's double-asterisk notation doesn't display properly on HN.",1368767109

Your social profile would be at risk (the sun would still rise tomorrow), but so would any other account on other services that are connected. Thats a little scary.

Security is hard. In my case, I'd trust services like Twitter and Facebook more than myself right now (they have tons of good engineers and much more to lose in case of a security breach).

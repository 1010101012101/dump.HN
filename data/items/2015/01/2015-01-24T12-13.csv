Although this is a very different case (cracked software was used to mix music), I wonder if something of a sort can be applied to Google here—they have the right and ability to &quot;supervise the infringing activity&quot; i.e. the Content ID system gives them the ability to know precisely if an infringement occurs, so a DMCA notice that is not compiled with might not be necessary for this to go to court.

It is seriously only recently that I have seen widespread discussion about how poorly linked lists perform in practice despite how theoretically nice they are.<p>Back in the olden days at least a few things were different compared to today: 1) your only point of reference and authority was academic writing that stressed theory over practice. Blogs weren&#x27;t around yet. So, you didn&#x27;t have any random blogs with hard measurements showing that in practice brute force often wins over elegance. 2) Back then, the memory/ALU gap wasn&#x27;t quite as drastic as it is today. 3) Available memory was drastically smaller than it is today.<p>Therefore, if you had a list with a length that was highly variable, the obvious go-to container was a linked list.  The idea of using an dynamic array of objects or pointers seemed highly wasteful from a memory fragmentation and copying point of view.<p>Today processors spend most of their time stalling on memory and only dreaming of the opportunity to copy a large, linear chunk of data.

Good time to contemplate and meditate.<p>09:00 - Work that I really like, feeling that I&#x27;m making something that makes a difference, with people I respect and being reasonably well paid for that.<p>12:15 - Lunch. 2 options: a) Buying something in the shop and walking around or going to the park to eat it. b) Going to a restaurant with colleagues/friends.<p>13:00 - Work that I really like, feeling that I&#x27;m making something that makes a difference, with people I respect and being reasonably well paid for that. Anyway I prefer to work mornings.<p>17:00 - Walking every day to a different gym in the city. Normally meeting friends there.<p>18:30 - Arriving home in the city and having a girl/woman with a great smile on her face waiting for you. Making/having a tasty and elaborated dinner together.<p>20:00 - Time for novelty: movies at home, meeting friends/new people, going somewhere. No TV. Unpredictability is great here.<p>24:00 - Sleep with a girl/woman with a smile in the face.<p><i>Worse (my unhappy times):</i><p>08:00 - Waking up alone.<p>08:30 - Long commute(1.5h) during rush hour to work, changing transportation 3 times.<p>10:00 - Work that I really hate, feeling that I&#x27;m making bullshit, with people I don&#x27;t respect and being very bad paid for that.<p>13:00 - Lunch. Taking food from home to compensate long commute costs and low wage.<p>14:00 - Work that I really hate, feeling that I&#x27;m making bullshit, with people I don&#x27;t respect and being very bad paid for that. Afternoons are even worse.<p>19:00 - Long commute home.<p>20:30 - Arriving home in suburbs. Too late and far way for gym. Eating something.<p>21:30 - Too late and far away to meet somebody. Crappy TV/internet till sleeping time.<p>24:00 - Sleep alone.",1422101734

8939407,comment,8935966,8935966,0,0,cpks,,,"This is the most confused article I have read in a long time.<p>1. &quot;Maker&quot; is one way to self-improve. As an engineer, it means that I pick up basic knowledge of other engineering domains in my free time, which lets me be a better engineer. As an entrepreneur, it lets me stay creative, and see what is possible.<p>2. Not being a maker is no more of a criticism than not doing pro-bono legal work, not volunteering, not engaging in continuing education, not being a cyclist, not doing yogo, or a million other things we do to make ourselves better people or the world a better place. We all do a few of them. None of us have time for all of them. The bad alternative is watching TV. There is no stigma attached with not being a maker, anymore than there is with not doing yoga.<p>3. Maker is not, and never has been, about the artifacts. It&#x27;s about the creativity, the process, and the learning. It&#x27;s fundamentally anti-materialistic. After a decade of making, I can sew. I can weld. I can machine. I can woodwork. I can code. I can design electronics. I can do a hundred other things. That makes me a better, more versatile individual than I was a decade ago. It&#x27;s also fundamentally different from making as blue collar work. Every artifact I&#x27;ve produced was about bettering myself or doing something creative.<p>4. On the other hand, she embodies why there is a stigma attached with being a homemaker, educator, and similar:<p>&quot;As an educator, the work I do is superficially the same, year on year. That’s because all of the actual change, the actual effects, are at the interface between me as an educator, my students, and the learning experiences I design for them.&quot;<p>I have a child. I have taken several courses in early childhood development. It makes me a better parent -- in very obvious ways. It saves me time in the net -- when my child has a behavior problem that I see other parents struggle with, I can usually resolve it quickly and efficiently. However, among homemakers, there is a stigma attached with knowing what you&#x27;re doing. The attitude is &quot;we don&#x27;t need somebody telling us how to raise our children,&quot; no matter how strong the evidence. Scientific research is confounded with parenting articles on link-bait sites. Properly raising children is essential, but that&#x27;s not what most stay-at-home moms do, most nannys do, or all but the most elite childcares do. Early childhood development has been binned into a blue collar job, and we see the unfortunate effects of that.<p>Teaching is very similar, especially at a college level. People clueless about teaching-and-learning run courses. At this point, I&#x27;ve taken about a dozen MOOCs in teaching-and-learning. I&#x27;ve engaged in a number of experimental teaching projects. All of my courses are blended. I actively and continuously measure the outcomes of how I run courses, use that to improve them, and when possible, publish about it.<p>If homemaking and teaching were to apply the same level of rigor to their work as engineering and coding, the level of those professions would go up to where it belongs. As it is, it has unfortunately become unskilled, blue collar work, and the author of the article embodies why.",1422101431

It is ruled by the bureaucrats running it, in conjunction with the artists that actually profit from it, i. e. old people with a large back catalogue. It&#x27;s constantly fighting with the businesses using music, i. e. youtube still blocks 90% of videos with music because they haven&#x27;t agreed on prices. Clubs might have to close because they&#x27;ve tripled prices recently. Small bands sometimes sign up, only to find out they actually have to pay to play their own songs, and through the magic of the most convoluted payout formula ever, might not actually get as much back as they pay in.

The running Linux kernel would then access physical hardware through a wrapper in the Rust kernel, while the Rust kernel would access hardware directly.<p>That&#x27;s really the only way I see this project gaining widespread adoption: by leveraging Linux. Linux simply has too much momentum to be replaced with something non-compatible.<p>Of course, a Rust kernel could be useful for all kinds of things other than replacing Linux.

A bad hire, especially in a startup, is terribly expensive.<p>Testing coding is mandatory.  Back in the &#x27;90s when C/C++ were the game, we used two tests, write code to create a doubly linked list, and look at a small function we&#x27;d put up on the white board and find problems with it.  Both were graded generously, it was pretty clear if the candidate had a clue or not.<p>Then general problem solving, i.e. some design problems, perhaps including a big/relatively difficult one, and have the candidate describe some design solutions they were proud of.<p>Code samples were very welcome if available, of course.<p>In all of this, you&#x27;d get a pretty good sense of whether you&#x27;d like to work with this person.  You&#x27;d also use the whole process to sell the company/project to the candidate, and see how they responded to that, they had to show either some interest in it, or for the more professionally oriented, something like an attitude that it would be no problem in due course and they would like the work.<p>Ah, especially for startups, get across the concept that &quot;you can&#x27;t be too proud to not sweep floors&quot; if needed, but that each engineer would be allocated both some of the less interesting work that just has to be done, and the interesting work.",1422101134

He just said that he was still facing those issues two months after the kid was born.<p>He seems like a smart and responsible guy.  The logical conclusion that most of us would come to is that raising kids is almost always harder than one expects.  Instead you somehow are convinced he should've rationally planned more.  And you are so confident of this without knowing anything about how he planned.",1216802606

254182,comment,254093,254175,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"That's a good example...and whenever I've brought up examples along those lines, a Java developer will say, ""But how often do those kinds of problems come up?""  And, then I pause to think about it, and I can't help but respond, ""What programming problems <i>aren't</i> that kind?""  When I think about development, I'm thinking, ""get some data, work on it, write it out"", and Java makes those tasks pretty complex.<p>I know there are problems for which Java is a great choice.  Google is not made up of stupid people, and they have a <i>lot</i> of Java code...it's their go to language for systems-level development.  But I can't think of any task that I write software for that would be better served by Java than Perl, Ruby, Python and probably even Smalltalk or Scheme or Lisp (though the latter three are weak when it comes to interacting with the system, and I build web-based systems management software--Smalltalk and Scheme and Lisp might be fine for the web-based part, but not so much on the systems management part, while Perl was pretty much designed for the purpose).",1216802104

254180,comment,254131,254131,0,0,sutro,,,"James Hong from ""Founders at Work"":<p>""And nothing ever goes according to plan. You can’t dwell on the fact that your plan didn’t work. In our case, we didn’t even have a plan, but it would have been worthless to have one anyway, since we just kept moving as fast as we could. You have to hustle; you can’t just have a plan and cakewalk it. You just have to know what direction you’re going in and run around like a rat in a maze trying to get out.""<p>Had James posted a question in a forum like this seeking advice at that early, clueless stage in his company's history, you probably would have chided him for his lack of sufficient up-front planning. Yet his story is indicative of many of the other founders profiled in the book, and many other founders that I admire. The reason these founders are successful is not because they are master planners, it's because they are master improvisers, a quality shared, I believe, by good parents.<p>Yes, kids are like startups, but pre-birth plans will change, and they are not what will make you successful as a founder or a parent. And if you haven't had kids or started a company, then your advice in those realms doesn't carry much weight.",1216801856

Completely new to working with the maps.<p>I've made a few of the more minor changes you recommended (including the scrolling), and just uploaded it to the server, but I think the fonts/images, etc is going to take me some time. Probably won't get that sorted today.<p>But you've really opened my eyes, shawndrost, I can't thank you enough.<p>I'll be making lots of changes over the next few days I'm sure.",1216801840

254176,comment,254131,254131,0,0,papa,,,"I enjoyed this post. For what it's worth, I often think of my startup as a kid (the analogy works both ways). Once the startup website went ""live"", it reminded me a lot of dealing with an infant. Site goes down any hour of the night, needs constant attention and tlc and doesn't give you much satisfaction for the first few months of its existence.<p>And I have 2 kids along with the startup, so I'd like to think I speak from experience. My personal feeling is that if you can handle raising a kid, you may be surprised at how prepared you are to handle a startup!",1216801608

I found it frustrating to watch as he struggled with even basic stuff like reading files, regex's and string splitting.<p>But here's the thing.. I couldn't even remember myself how to match or replace a string based on a regex.<p>I consider myself a fairly smart programmer, but I probably couldn't write a Java program to read a file and match some regular expressions without looking at the API. Java makes it hard!<p>Perhaps this example isn't very fair to Java, but this kind of thing comes up all the time.<p>I'm sure even the 'average' Java programmer would have no trouble doing this in Ruby (or Python, take your pick) in 2 minutes.",1216801328

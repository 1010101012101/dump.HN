A client can make a single request to ""open a session"" and receive a short-lived key that is used as the password credentials for subsequent requests. Store active keys - since they are short-lived, offline attacks are less of a concern and you can probably choose to not slow-hash them. When the token expires and a request fails authentication, the client simply requests a new one and retries. The token lifetime is a much easier adjustment for which to weigh security versus performance/load considerations, compared to against broader password storage security.",1366297193

5570960,comment,5570625,5570625,2,0,SeanKilleen,,,"A comment response I posted on the blog. It could use some more fleshing out, links to support, etc. but I think I captured what I feel. Apologies for the verbosity.<p>----<p>I appreciate your viewpoint, but I think you have a simplified idea of the context and history surrounding efforts at gun control legislation.<p>The Second Amendment reads: ""A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.""<p>Therefore, I have no problem with people owning as many weapons as they need...in the context of a well-regulated militia. Unfortunately, the Second Amendment has, over a long period of time, been co-opted and transformed from ""a well-regulated militia"" to ""everyone should be able to own an assault rifle"". This is, by no coincidence, backed by the NRA, who long ago became less about the rights of gun owners and more about the interests of gun manufacturers. (can't blame them; it's where the money is.) I don't see the type of gun control proposed here as eroding the Second Amendment in any way; however, supporters see any legislation that doesn't make it easier to get any gun as eroding the amendment. It has become a symbol, rather than people considering it in its context. Even strict interpreters of the constitution should find it hard to ignore the phrase ""well-regulated militia"". And it's not an answer to say ""oh, in today's context that would totally mean any citizen who wants a gun.""<p>Outside this context, I see guns for hunting as fine and guns for personal protection as fine, because I think we can agree that removing those would impede upon safety and liberty. However, outside of the context of a well-regulated militia, I fail to see a scenario where a citizen would need an assault-class weapon designed for a theater of war, even in a distressing scenario of personal attack.<p>Also, background checks are not an invasion of privacy, though that's a convenient claim to make. Whenever someone could impact the lives of others (e.g. teachers, government workers with sensitive information), they are required to undergo a background check. I see no reason to oppose background checks anytime someone is going to own something that could end my life and the main purpose of which is to inflict deadly harm. 89% of Americans agree with me on that, including the majority of both the GOP and the NRA's member base. And yet, the legislation was defeated -- not by a vote, but by the inability to break a standard filibuster practice that now routinely requires 60 votes for a law to pass.<p>The issue of privacy as a civil liberty and bearing arms as a civil liberty are completely separate amendments, and need to be considered in their separate contexts. The issue of privacy <i>could</i> have been applicable, if the gun legislation contained a national gun registry. There's a legitimate argument to be made there, and it would have made me slightly squeamish too. However, the law specifically did not include such a registry and would not lead to one; even John McCain and several other senators (with A ratings from the NRA) said as much. A misinformation campaign was spread to poison the bill based on fear, and it got the minority riled up, and was just enough to cower the senate.<p>I do think that an actual hypocrisy exists in this debate, but from a slightly different perspective -- time and time again, the same groups that claim they need guns to protect against the government, also rally to stop the military's budget from being cut in the slightest, claiming it endangers our security (despite the fact that our military budget outpaces the closest 10+ nations combined). The same folks who envision needing a small arsenal to protect themselves against the government are the same people who are totally OK with drones, seemingly without thought that those are the same weapons that would be used by a hostile government against them. Thus, the fantasy lives on -- folks stockpile weapons in a fantasy to play the hero against the tyrant, and at the same time support all the tools of supposed said tyrant. These are not the majority of gun owners, but they number a large portion of those who rally around the ownership of assault and military style weapons for use by civilians.<p>I understand the inclination to make these sorts of arguments; it's easier to say ""it's everyone's fault, really"" -- than to get down into it and be drawn in the sometimes vile world of partisan politics. I've been to a shooting range, and I don't demonize those who desire to own guns. But at some point, a reality has to become clear -- people are dying because we're doing nothing. We can argue about what should be done, but when near-universal agreement exists on something as simple as a watered-down background check, and it still can't pass congress, we've gone a little too far my taste.",1366297139

For the most part England was developing steam power not importing it, so while the US with massive coal reserves may have been interested in developing coal power presumably England would have focused it's R&D on other things.<p><i>The development of the stationary steam engine was an important element of the Industrial Revolution; however, for most of the period of the Industrial Revolution, the majority of industrial power was supplied by water and wind.  In Britain by 1800 an estimated 10,000 horsepower was being supplied by steam. By 1815 steam power had grown to 210,000 hp.[38]</i> Note: The industrial revolution started in 1760 and ended between 1820 and 1840. So, in my hypothetical situation England may have imported coal for shipping and railways but industry would have probably looked at imported coal as to expensive and used alternatives.

5570874,comment,5570625,5570625,5,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>""Do we really think that some civil liberties are better than others?""</i><p>Yes, we do.<p>This argument raises some interesting points, but it rests on several false equivalencies. The first is that all liberties are equal in weight, impact, those protected and those affected, etc. This is noticeably untrue, even at a passing glance. Consider the First and Third Amendments, for example. Would anyone credibly argue that the right not to have to quarter soldiers in one's home is equal to the rights to protected speech, a free press, and freedom of religion? No. The latter set of rights is much more broad, encompassing, foundational, and frequently relied upon. The former is incredibly specific, and has become less germane over time. Both are protected liberties, but their impact weights are different.<p>The second false equivalency is that all items written in the Constitution are equivalent in validity, timelessness, applicability, and contextual universality. A piece of paper written in the late 18th century isn't a living, adaptive, self-improving organism. <i>Society</i> is the living, adaptive, self-improving organism. We follow the principles of the Constitution, but we amend it (hence, the purpose of Amendments themselves) as situations arise and circumstances require adaptation. The Constitution is the code; we are the recursively self-improving expression of that code.<p>Please note: capital-L Liberty should not be conflated with specific liberties. An intelligent and self-improving society makes its best attempt to preserve all liberties under the rubric of Liberty, but recognizes that some liberties conflict with others, and that some have net-beneficial or net-detrimental social outcomes, and that the status thereof fluctuates over time and within specific contexts.",1366296421

The second subscription would most likely be used to engage other players, whether their victims are up for the challenge or not. If an EVE player is engaged illegally, the attacker becomes red-flagged, and if they keep it up, eventually won't be able to traverse high security solar systems without being pursued by a Faction Navy or CONCORD(EVE in-game police). Running from CONCORD is a bannable offense - as in, banned from the game.<p>EVE is a wonderful world of capitalism, piracy, industry, and exploration, but I do wish CCP had a way of counting the number of players instead of subscriptions.",1366296173

Were one to type that question into google, it would spit out hundreds of results saying the same things. The answer is already out there. As hackers, we follow the DRY rule, especially when giving help. If it's out there on the interweb, then please tell why we should explain it yet one more time.<p>In the end, it's a balance of efforts. While it would take the expert 15 minutes to craft a good explanatory reply, it would take the asker a few minutes to type it into Google and read the first few responses that pop up. For any good question, the burden of time should be on the asker.",1366295997

The major difference is the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which was ratified 31 years ago.<p>At the time, there was a furore in England over the fact that the Charter would supersede statutes (which, in turn, supersede common law). Some lawmakers considered it unconscionable that the courts could strike down a law for violating the Charter. Apparently the fact that Canada wanted to patriate its Constitution almost triggered a constitutional crisis in England.<p>Since then, Canadian courts have indeed struck down a number of laws, including restrictions on access to abortion, restrictions on religious expression and dress, denial of collective bargaining rights, prohibitions on same sex marriage, and the right of convicted prisoners to vote.<p>The Charter enshrines human rights protection and equality for women, minorities and other vulnerable Canadians - including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Canadians, through court decisions that extended the list of prohibited grounds for discrimination in Section 15.<p>The sections on legal rights have also driven changes to the way police services operate, strengthening protections for personal privacy, freedom from unreasonable or arbitrary detainment and seizure, and due process on arrest.<p>In the years since the Charter was signed, legislatures still have the right to pass laws - but thanks to the Charter, those laws must be so constructed that they do not curtail our rights and freedoms. Where they do, courts now have the power to strike them down.<p>I don't think I would want to live in a system where legislators were not bound by a charter of rights and freedoms to ensure that statutes do not violate them.",1366294789

Storage cost for nuclear waste (thousands of years - most likely hundreds if not 1000s of Billions in cost)<p>About 2 years ago in Europe an in-depth scientific study into the actual cost of (uranium based) nuclear power has been undertaken (paid by various European institutions) including all subsidies provided to the power companies for building these nuclear power plants (in Europe hundreds of Billions) and (as far as I remember) also parts of the actual cost for waste - the outcome: true cost per KWh ~1.20 EUR - cost base used in business / profit calculations about 0.02 EUR",1366293636

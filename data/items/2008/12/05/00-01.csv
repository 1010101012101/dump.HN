386433,story,,,6,3,matt1,"Ask HN: Should you hide members-only features for non-members?",,"I'm working on a site and am deciding on some semi-important design issues.<p>The app revolves around one main page, which new visitors will see when they arrive to the site and which registered users will see once they've logged in. The main difference is that when someone is logged in, they'll have additional options (links) on that page.<p>Few usability/business questions:<p>1. Should I hide these links for people who are not logged in or do I include them, but direct them to the login/registration page? On one hand, it's slightly annoying for a new customer to be unexpectedly led to a registration page but on the other hand, it'll likely lead to more registrations since they'll get to see the features they'd have with an account. Another viable option would be to make the members only links a different color.<p>2. Probably a small detail, but: 'Sign in' or 'Log in'?<p>3. What do you think about letting customers log in on the main page (with a email/password input box) vs link them to a separate log in page? Most sites let people log in on the main page, but I'm leaning away from it to keep the main page simple and uncluttered. Thoughts?<p>4. Does anyone else use Firebug to edit the dimensions of this text box while typing a post? :)<p>Thanks in advance.",1228438701

But I think it is possible the very thing that makes the site such a joy is what makes it hard to gain traction, and that is the lack of content/information outside of the actual music. Users need to be getting a constant stream of info to hold their attention. If a site doesn't do this it sends a subliminal message to the user ""nothing new here, I'm never coming back""- they may not even be aware of this and they may have nothing but great things to say about your site but they might not return either. I feel you may need more emotional branding of the artists to hold everyones attention, and more intimate connection to the music industry. In a perfect world you would not have to clutter up your site with any of the following suggestions but maybe there is a way to incorporate some new elements without sacrificing the gorgeousness of it all.<p>1)Video content never fails to resonate with users, it would be great for artists to embed their existing online video content somewhere on your site.\n2) Do any of the artists have their own groups on Ning? Can you create a loop somehow?\n3)Do the artists have flickr groups? Are they on tour, can you integrate their Dopplr profiles if they have them?\n4)Geographical info mashup? Where is the music coming from? Where do the artists live? Can you figure out how to provide information regarding gigs? \n5)Take the blog more seriously. Maybe don't hide it? Blog more often, mention music related links and stuff that may not directly concern the site. Maybe you should think of the blog as the marketing? (feedback loop again)<p>I could continue but I'm not sure if I'm on the right track here. I look at everything with a marketing/social engineering prospective, I don't write code.

It's a fairly interesting problem, but not normal ""startupish"" stuff.<p>I have no formal education, no credentials (other than code).<p>I landed this job by doing what I had been doing for a while: going to the bottom-of-the-barrel freelance sites like rentacoder, and skimming through the job postings each day until I found things that didn't look painfully boring, weren't asking for way too much for way too little, and weren't ""OMG FIX MY PHP CODEBASE"" - because I had done a few of those, and they are <i>far</i> from fun. That's another story though.<p>I did (and still do) have an ace up my sleeve - I live really cheaply.

You don't want to carry gold around - people aren't accustomed to trading in it and would be wary of it, and even a little bit of gold is a lot of money.<p>Key characteristic of something you can use as a currency of last resort is that it must be a liquid market - lots of people willing to trade in it.<p>Things that affect this:<p>- Whether or not the government can successfully enforces exchange controls (i.e. you accept that thus much gold is equivalent to thus many units of currency).<p>- Government mechanisms to outlaw rival forms of currency.<p>- Whether it is easy to determine the worthiness of an item of currency (gold is subject to the archimedes test)<p>- Whether you can deal in small items (you don't want to have to carry a fortunate around in your pocket, you want to be able to make small purchases).<p>The idea of redeemable value stores is something I have quirky ideas about from time to time. I first became aware of Gresham's Law (bad money chases good out of a marketplace) at school with marbles, when I accidentally debased the valuing system. I was rubbish at marbles and had lost all of mine but convinced a few people that there would be value in playing for marbles which were 'demented' in interesting ways (this was all I had left). It wasn't a grand plan - just something to allow me to keep playing. People tend to be protective of their marbles, but playing for demended marbles allowed them to have games with lower risk. But after a bit I actually saw a younger kid cripple a worthwhile marble in order that he could enter a game and remember a guilty feeling that I'd done something bad. The marble craze was dead within days. Maybe the craze was on its way out and the only reason the demented thing got traction was because people were already tiring of it. It was an interesting introduction to the idea of a store of value though.<p>Ideas: barrels of printer ink, ipv4 ip addresses (could you forge a currency from these? Probably not - I think they're site-bound and therefore not all that transferable or fungible), staples, bicycle tires, quality first aid kits. There's an interesting battle going on between free banking and governments at the moment. By bringing the banks further ""into the family"", eliminating havens like Swizerland and Luxemburg through strategic bailouts and undermining Lietchenstein with espionage, governments are delaying a separation between currencies and governments. Iceland may be a good place from which to launch such a scheme - they have the infrastructure, would be generally considered trustworthy and they are at odds with Britain. New Zealand could work as a base, also.",1228435336

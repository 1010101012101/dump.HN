Most folks who say that its hard or messy don't understand it and are approaching it the wrong way.<p>I'm learning Objective-C right now, and it seems to be hard to develop in, at first. Why do I have to put @ in front of strings, or NSLog(@""%@"", myVar); to log a string? Why are there so many data types? Wtf is up with all the brackets?<p>As soon as I actually started at the very basics, this stuff started to make sense. Its a different language with its own ways of solving problems.

Those photos of glowing curtains of color are taken from space, here on earth they just look like dim green glow (brief explanation below). You are not missing anything, I promise you.<p><i>Most of the energetic particles from the Sun are deflected around the Earth by the magnetosphere, but some get trapped. Electrons trapped in the Earth's magnetic field (the magnetic mirror effect) are accelerated along the magnetic field toward the Polar Regions and then strike the gases into the upper layer of the atmosphere, called the ionosphere. In the ionosphere, the speeding electrons collide violently with gas atoms. This gives the gas atoms energy, which causes them to release both light and more electrons. In this way, the gases of the ionosphere start to glow producing the spectacle that we know as the auroras.<p>Variations in colour are due to the type of gas particles that are colliding. The most common auroral color, a pale yellowish-green, is produced by oxygen molecules located about 60 miles above the earth. Rare, all-red auroras are produced by high-altitude oxygen, at heights of up to 200 miles. Nitrogen produces blue or purplish-red aurora.</i>",1304097359

I'm sure there are people that would give $500+ in one shot, but then he has to set a runway, keeping asking, etc. in order to continue that.

Most people haven't done it right in the past which is why they think it is a bad idea for everyone.<p>Find a hungry young performer who is willing to forgo a guaranteed compensation plan for a high potential compensation plan and pay them on performance. Somone with 3+ years under their belt, hopefully without kids and a high mortgage. (If they have renters subsidizing their rent: bonus points, that's a money minded sales person.) Use a ramp or draw if you have to. (Draw: is where salary now is taken out of future commissions. Ramp: it varies but maybe now they get X base salary and Z% commission and as the pipeline grows, they get a smaller base and higher commission.) I have been in sales for over 10 years and am dying to jump ship for a start up with potential but do not have the safety net at the moment.<p>Incentive-ize overperformance. Make their commission .75X at 0% - 75% of goal, X% at 76 - 100%, 1.25X% at 125%+. (Arbitrary numbers there, figure out what make sense for you.) You want to make them fight to make more money.<p>Don't think you have to bring in a seasoned VP of Sales from another company. They're like old Jaguars. Classy, expensive, impressive, high performance potentially, but you never know if they are going to start. Most of those guys are looking at you as a way to pass time between here and retirement.

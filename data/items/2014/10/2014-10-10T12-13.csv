And as you neatly clarified, I disqualified myself from serious discussion of my own depression.<p>I don&#x27;t think I have a better solution than what already exists, but I&#x27;m trying to get people to understand that human experience can&#x27;t be completely generalised. When your framework disparages the remarks of people that have been depressed and have left depression surely there might be a problem there?<p>I will reiterate:<p><pre><code>  1. I had depression caused by long-term external factors.
  It&#x27;s popular to think this doesn&#x27;t happen but it can happen.
  2. When I went to see a therapist I received platitudes and 
  coping strategies however as I had an external factor this
  felt like treating the effect and not the cause.
  3. It was really bad. I feel like I&#x27;m arguing with a bunch of 
  people that have no way of empathising.
</code></pre>
It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t believe people can be cured but a combination of internal and external factors can make this difficult, and in the few case I know of people that have been depressed they have been &quot;cared for&quot; but not &quot;cured&quot; by the system.",1412945947

8437418,comment,8436309,8436826,0,0,richardjdare,,,"That&#x27;s a very interesting question.<p>I&#x27;d guess that the technical decisions that differentiated early unix from the lisp machines etc. were based on hardware and cost limitations.(the development of unix is something I&#x27;d be interested in reading more about) Then as unix took off, these technologies became entrenched, with a kind of apologetics developing amongst users who liked those systems, or never used anything else.<p>There&#x27;s an interview with Bill Joy where he said that Vi&#x27;s famous modal interface was merely a result of his poor quality terminal and network connection, and now it&#x27;s used by millions of programmers. I&#x27;m not saying that these users are wrong about the benefits of modal editing or the unix text interface etc, but that these are <i>discovered</i> benefits that are then used to retroactively construct a containing narrative of justification that often walls people off from alternatives.<p>I&#x27;d also hazard a guess that many of these technologies were simply inaccessible and/or unknown to the mass of post-pc-revolution developers who create the bulk of our present systems. The number of devs who had access to Lisp machines was small compared to the number who came in with Unix with its success in the workstation market, and tiny compared to the number of devs who came in through home computers/PCs.<p>I myself grew up with 80s home computers, moving to the PC and Linux in the late 90&#x27;s. Lisp machines, Oberon etc. were unknown to me until a few years ago, and information about them is still hard to come by. Nearly all the lisp machine sites are web 1.0 with broken links etc. Very few of them try to market the benefits of these systems to people in the wider community.<p>After I got interested in lisp and lisp machines (thanks pg!) I spent a weekend getting that notorious leaked Symbolics Genera distribution working on Linux, inside virtual box on my mac. After a few hours in the Listener, with its rich output and superior incremental help system I wanted to show it to everybody I knew. It was one of the most incredible things I had ever seen on a computer. For the next few weeks at work I was occupied with the constant thought, &quot;This is not as good as Genera&quot;. It&#x27;s had a huge impact on how I think about software, even my indie game development.",1412945708

Erik Kain at Forbes published opinions on Intel&#x27;s decision[1], and also includes a laughably charitable take on the Leigh Alexander article that sparked the consumer revolt.  It&#x27;s worth reading if you are falling for the narrative that Intel buckled under pressure from a harassment campaign.<p>Eric Johnson also writes:<p><i>But that’s not what Gamergate has shown it cares about in practice. The labels of “ethics” and “corruption” are, to date, a thin veil over an ongoing attempt to undermine women in the gaming industry and the games press. Anyone who advocates for gender equality, or better representation, or even just a more open discussion is considered an enemy to be bullied, boycotted or, in some cases, harassed.</i><p>This is flat-out incorrect and full of dishonest generalizations.<p><i>undermine women in the gaming industry and the games press</i><p>Easily shown to be false.  #GamerGate is very diverse, actively promotes inclusiveness (#NotYourShield), and even helped raise over $20,000 to fund The Fine Young Capitalists project, which is specifically about helping women create games.<p><i>Anyone who advocates for gender equality, or better representation, or even just a more open discussion is considered an enemy to be bullied</i><p>Once again, easily shown to be false.  Many advocate for gender equality or &quot;better representation&quot; and don&#x27;t even attract criticism, much less bullying or harassment.  The Escapist Magazine started out in the middle of this mess, and has continued to publish opinions on the issue, but escaped boycotts and consumer action for two simple reasons:  1) Greg Tito stood by a fair and just interpretation of their site&#x27;s rules and allowed discussion to continue in their forum, even against his personal bias and in the face of Ben Kuchera (Polygon)&#x27;s bullying on the GameJournoPros mailing list[2].  2) The Escapist Magazine made a good faith attempt to respond to the fairest relevant criticism they were able to identify.<p>The publications currently under boycott and consumer action campaigns failed to do what The Escapist did.<p>But it wasn&#x27;t until Allum Bokhari stepped up and published an article at TechCrunch [3] that #GamerGate began to get any kind of fair coverage outside Breitbart, isolated blogs, forums, and youtube streams.<p><i>Even if Quinn were the person Gjoni and his adherents claim she is, she’s a person, not a government or multinational company; her only impact on the public was being a female game developer who made an atypical, critically acclaimed game.</i><p>Right, see what he&#x27;s doing here?  He&#x27;s reframing away from specific allegations in favor of a generalized narrative with conveniently defined identities.  But he&#x27;s not very good at it, since he still makes a false claim.  It&#x27;s most certainly not true that Zoe Quinn&#x27;s only impact on the public has been &quot;being a female game developer.&quot;  There are other allegations such as those related to The Fine Young Capitalists.

So while neither is as mature as Scala (I really don&#x27;t like Scala but I won&#x27;t get into that again), Kotlin is as close to risk-free as possible, while Ceylon is more ambitious.

In these cases, you&#x27;re right: discouraging women who have thought about the process would be seen as in bad taste.<p>But what if the woman was being pressured to abort (or to keep) the child by outside pressure? Then intervention would be seen as supporting the woman, not as interfering, and it&#x27;d be in good taste.<p>IMO, suicide is very similar. A large proportion of suicide attempts are people who go on to regret it and successfully seek treatment. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too much of a leap from that to the idea that a large proportion of suicides themselves are being done for the wrong reasons, i.e. the &quot;outside pressure&quot; of a brain that is suffering a mental illness.",1412943351

First, one must be nominated by an eligible nominator:[1]<p>&quot;Who may nominate candidates for the Peace Prize?<p>&quot;According to the statutes of the Nobel Foundation, a nomination is considered valid if it is submitted by a person who falls within one of the following categories:<p>&quot;Members of national assemblies and governments of states<p>&quot;Members of international courts<p>&quot;University rectors; professors of social sciences, history, philosophy, law and theology; directors of peace research institutes and foreign policy institutes<p>&quot;Persons who have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize<p>&quot;Board members of organizations that have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize<p>&quot;Active and former members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee; (proposals by members of the Committee to be submitted no later than at the first meeting of the Committee after February 1)<p>&quot;Former advisers to the Norwegian Nobel Committee&quot;<p>Then there is a process for choosing a prize winner or prize winners for the year from among the list of nominees:[2]<p>&quot;At the first meeting of the Nobel Committee after the February 1 deadline for nominations, the Committee&#x27;s Permanent Secretary presents the list of the year&#x27;s candidates. The Committee may on that occasion add further names to the list, after which the nomination process is closed, and discussion of the particular candidates begins. In the light of this first review, the Committee draws up the so-called short list - i.e. the list of candidates selected for more thorough consideration. The short list typically contains from twenty to thirty candidates.<p>&quot;The candidates on the short list are then considered by the Nobel Institute&#x27;s permanent advisers. In addition to the Institute&#x27;s Director and Research Director, the body of advisers generally consists of a small group of Norwegian university professors with broad expertise in subject areas with a bearing on the Peace Prize. The advisers usually have a couple of months in which to draw up their reports. Reports are also occasionally requested from other Norwegian and foreign experts.<p>&quot;When the advisers&#x27; reports have been presented, the Nobel Committee embarks on a thorough-going discussion of the most likely candidates. In the process, the need often arises to obtain additional information and updates about candidates from additional experts, often foreign. As a rule, the Committee reaches a decision only at its very last meeting before the announcement of the Prize at the beginning of October.<p>&quot;The Committee seeks to achieve unanimity in its selection of the Peace Prize Laureate. On the rare occasions when this proves impossible, the selection is decided by a simple majority vote.&quot;<p>With that in mind, it&#x27;s actually remarkable to me how often non-politicians and non-jurists have won the Nobel Prize for world peace. Each year, the committee has a lot of nominees to consider from a lot of different sources. During the process of investigating nominees and seeking unanimity, a lot of names fall out of consideration.<p>[1] <a href=""http://nobelpeaceprize.org/en_GB/nomination_intro/nomination_criteria/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nobelpeaceprize.org/en_GB/nomination_intro/nomination...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/peace/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/peace/</a>",1412943148

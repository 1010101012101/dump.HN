9450587,story,,,1,0,ElChe,"Run Goldy, Run New highly addictive game with 10% proceeds going to charity",,"Hey guys, I want to invite you to check out my new game, Run Goldy, Run! It&#x27;s basically a 2D sidescroller based on dodging a never ending onslaught of enemies, with the twist of being able to run on the top or the bottom of the floor. It sounds confusing, but it&#x27;s completely intuitive once you get into it. There&#x27;s two basic controls, FLIP and SHOOT, blending the simplicity of games like Flappy Bird with the insane difficulty of...also Flappy Bird. It tells the simple story of a sheep with golden fleece who was born to run, and the eternal swarm of enemies who will stop at nothing to claim his precious pelt. Anyway, it&#x27;s my first major game release and I&#x27;d really like to invite all of you to check it out on the AppStore or my website, goldythesheep.com.<p>Given that it&#x27;s my first real project and I have little to no experiencing designing games, I&#x27;m not anticipating to make a huge wad of cash off of it. However, 10% of whatever I do make off of content ads will be donated to charity, specifically Children&#x27;s Hospital in Dallas. I&#x27;m a guy who likes to play games, and I made a game that I hope you will enjoy playing, but if that doesn&#x27;t grab you, you can also help the disadvantaged. That&#x27;s right, you can play an awesome game, support a budding indie studio, and help the poor, all at the same time!<p>So again, try it out, let me know what you think, and if you enjoy, please share. Have a good run!

Their cars quite simply did not break down.<p>Detroit made cars that were not as good, but were quite fast and comparable in price.  Way different set of tradeoffs.<p>One was utilitarian and efficient and reasonably safe.  The other was VROOM!<p>A look at the odometers from that period revealed very few manufacturers bothered with anything over 99,999 miles.  Many American cars would not go that distance without requiring some very significant service, or encountering some critical failure.  Timing belt, pump, etc...<p>The Toyota cars would go much longer times between failures, and those tradeoffs have played out in the market.<p>Today, big American cars aren&#x27;t as cheap, they still are pretty fast, and pretty good.  I&#x27;ve an SUV that&#x27;s going to demonstrate a service life profile very similar to that old &#x27;89 Corolla, both of which I probably won&#x27;t retire until 400K miles.<p>The vehicles are that good now.<p>So that triangle can bend, and it&#x27;s not binary as others have mentioned.  It&#x27;s a continuum where a whole bunch of things are always moving and changing.<p>The other thing about time and money is how the markets play out.  Sometimes it&#x27;s good.  Apple took that path a few times and ended up with nice margins and in some cases great share.  In other cases, modest share, but margins that are worth it.<p>Fair enough.<p>Other times, being that late to market may well render the time and money expense moot as the use value is already being actualized in other products, leaving a superior entry with a saturated market that has very little incentive to purchase again.",1430194907

  point of the program. The thinking revolves around state, when it should be
  updated, and what it should be updated to. Stuffing this all behind a monad
  results in unnatural-feeling programs.
</code></pre>
Changing state is the point of almost any long-running user-facing application. And you are correct, thinking about when state should be updated and what it should be updated to is very important. So important in-fact, that allowing state updates to occur <i>anywere in the program</i>, with no rhyme nor reason, dramatically reduces an engineer’s ability to understand that program.<p>It may feel natural, or familiar, or easy to change state wherever it is convenient to do so. But that doesn’t make it a good engineering decision. As I mentioned in another comment it introduces complexity around logical reasoning, future change, code re-use, and testing.<p>It is much simpler if you define your application’s state in one place, and in terms of the actions that can be performed to update the state. This is simple, and easy to reason about. Then the functions to update the state can be pure. Again, this is simple, and easy to reason about.",1430751508

I&#x27;m totally behind golden rice.<p>Altering the organism to resist herbicides or express pesticides that have potential toxicity to humans is a matter for some concern.  The alteration itself may not even present a threat directly, but may enable an agricultural practice that causes harm.<p>For instance, herbicide resistant crops may absorb the herbicide, the safety of which was determined based primarily on inhalation and skin contact, and become the vector for an unforeseen risk from ingestion.  Some people have made some provocative unproven claims that the symptoms of gluten sensitivity are actually adequately explained by glyphosate poisoning, mainly from crops that have been chemically dessicated prior to harvest.  Obviously, glyphosate-resistant crops would not be dessicated pre-harvest with glyphosate, but they would have been sprayed with it during the growing season.  I can&#x27;t say for certain whether that particular chemical would be retained or degraded in any given plant.  But I know that a tiny, tiny amount is present in much of what I eat.  Is it dangerous?  I don&#x27;t know.  I don&#x27;t even know how I would prove it if it was.  I always have the option to eat different foods, or differently cultivated foods (i.e. organic), if I so choose.<p>But the primary reason I&#x27;m mostly against GMO is the brutish nonsense surrounding <i>patented seeds</i>.  The slow accumulation of possibly barely-toxic chemicals in my gut is less of a concern to me than the lawyer that orders a person to pay a license fee on each kernel of corn that he or she intends to plant.  <i>That guy</i> is manipulating the entire market for food, changing the whole business model for farming, and that scares the insoluble fiber out of me.<p>The primary threat isn&#x27;t in the <i>genes</i>; it&#x27;s in the <i>laws</i>.",1430751252

Rust&#x27;s compiler prevents you from moving data into a method which then nulls it out, leaving a dangling pointer in the calling code.  At best this dangling pointer will look at garbage and cause a crash or undefined behavior.  At worst, it will look at other, actively-used memory and cause a security vulnerability.

Everything is explicit, the only surprises are panics which are cataclysmic anyhow.<p><i>> And it seems just as likely you&#x27;ll end up crashing your program due to a bounds-check error (which may happen more often since Rust encourages indexing over references due to this very design.. at least, so I&#x27;ve read).</i><p>If you use iterators in Rust, you never need to worry about out of bounds errors.

The first was that she ordered the layoffs but reopened the same number of jobs in foreign countries, and in many cases more jobs. The work force of HP actually grew significantly over her tenure, just with cheaper foreign labor.<p>This is in contrast to Meg Whitman who, during my personal tenure at HP, laid off far more employees than Carly. Meg though did not try to add back head count in a cheaper way. She was just reducing the work force, which was needed. When I started HP had 360,000 employees, post Carly. (Disclosure: I was laid off from HP during a Whitman lay off).<p>The other thing which made Carly&#x27;s lay off controversial was that they changed HPs technical ecosystem pretty significantly. For most of HPs history they had been giving employees significant amounts of equity in the company. When Carly came in there were high ranking technologist with quite a bit of voting ability due to their stock holdings. This put a real cramp on the executives ability to make decisions without those pesky engineers using logic to ruin it. When she first came in, for example, she couldn&#x27;t get board approval to lay people off.<p>To solve the problem Carly did two things. First she diluted the value of the existing stock by merging with compaq. After that the existing power that the engineers held was diluted enough that she could make the decisions she wanted without as much problem.<p>This is where the quote having to do with laying people off quicker comes from. She really had to work for those lay offs by restructuring a company first. Another often heard comment from her was that a business as big as HP should never be run or managed by engineers...

It&#x27;s never seen a single battery, yet I&#x27;ve had it with me on camping, business trips, burning man - everywhere.  60 seconds on the crank gets me 20 minutes of radio.  I hope to have it with me another 15 years.<p>Likewise, my Mountain Equipment Co-Op Backpack that I&#x27;ve had for 18 years - I&#x27;ve had that with me <i>every single day</i> for 19 years, it&#x27;s my laptop case, my tool case, my document holder - In the Amazon Jungle, Luxembourg, and with Network Engineers in London, Dubai and Singapore.

This could be achieved thru various network sniffing tools, or some surreptitious people hacking. So relying on encryption alone does not solve anything.<p>If your guest WiFi is un-encrypted, i.e. no password/WPA, there is still transport layer encryption like HTTPS, that will secure the connection between the client and server, i.e. your web browser and your bank website. HTTPS assumes that you are on an insecure connection, that&#x27;s what it was designed for!<p>Finally, many guest networks implement client isolation, which prevents clients on the LAN from communicating directly with each other or to other private LAN&#x27;s connected to the guest network.

That would be the best-case though, and it might just bomb and be forgotten within months, which in fact seems to be the common expectation from many.<p>In any case, this was one of the most unabashedly biased articles I&#x27;ve seen on HN, with badly made attempts at revisionistic history. Perl is still my favourite scripting language, but even I have to admit that Perl 6 has little hope of adoption, and Perl 5 is dying a slow and painful death: due to the momentum, clarity and leadership and P6 took away from it. A few ported-back features gained can&#x27;t possibly make up for the lack of a cohesive vision that resulted from nobody being sure of the status of the Perl 5 language. Subroutine arguments have long languished in interminable bikeshedding due to this (despite actually having a few enthusiastic implementors - a rare phenomenon in P5 world now!), and we have embarrassments like autoderef and smartmatch[1] which reduce people&#x27;s trust in the language even more.<p>What makes the situation truly infuriating though, is the snarky and superior attitudes taken by most P6 folk, just like this article exhibits.

Not to loang after this UNIX graphics workstations like Sun, Apollo and MicroVAX came out and the market switch to UNIX/Linux.<p>Second was the expert systems boom in the mid-1980s.  This was fanned by Stanford professor Fegeinbaum who wrote the infamous book The 5th Generation about expert system computers being the future and Japan was building the best ones. These would either be LISP machines or an interesting French niche language called prologic. Prologic basically traversed a databse &quot;if-then&quot; rules (modus pons).

You need to be able to use the cache of the GPU in your application, otherwise your performance is guaranteed to be memory-bound. The reason you want to avoid branches is that there is only one control unit per a number of cores on the GPU, which means that if some threads follow one branch they will have to stall until the other threads complete. Generally the only code that maps well to the GPU is that which contains large for loops and has good spacial locality (e.g. matrix multiplication).<p>The author is comparing a GPU to a CPU, yet the CPU is only running a single thread (supposedly, the author did not provide the CPU code used in the comparison). For a true comparison the full capability of the CPU should be exposed by means of a multithreaded application (and, as someone else has already mentioned, vector instructions such as SSE).

9486306,comment,9485871,9485871,0,0,dalke,,,"While not essential to the argument, it uses software development as an analogy for scientific publications. Unfortunately, that analogy isn&#x27;t correct.<p>> Just as the software industry has moved from a &quot;waterfall&quot; process to an &quot;agile&quot; process—from monolithic releases shipped from warehouses of mass-produced disks to over-the-air differential updates—so must academic publishing move from its current read-only model and embrace a process as dynamic, up-to-date, and collaborative as science itself.<p>&quot;Agile&quot; is one name for a long line of software processes, which includes XP, RAD, and Unified Process. Iterative development stretches back to the dawn of software engineering. In modern practice, &quot;agile&quot; seems used for anything which is even a touch more flexible than the strictest of waterfall. Take your process, add a standup meeting or story cards, and <i>poof</i>, you&#x27;re agile.<p>Nor is &quot;agile&quot; development tied so closely to &#x27;over-the-air differential updates&#x27;. The development methodology has very little to do with deployment. Perhaps the easiest example is to look at the various language implementations (Python, Ruby, gcc, etc.). They don&#x27;t have auto-update. So I guess the question is, are they agile?<p>> But academic literature makes no distinction between citations merely considered significant and ones additionally considered true. What academic literature needs goes deeper than the view of citations as kudos and shout-outs. It needs what software engineers have used for decades: dependency management.<p>> A dependency graph would tell us, at a click, which of the pillars of scientific theory are truly load-bearing.<p>I have no idea of how to make this work. I give as an example the Kabsch algorithm algorithm for RMSD minimization of two molecular structures (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabsch_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabsch_algorithm</a> ). The original paper contained an error that sometimes resulted in a sign error. This was fixed in a subsequent paper.<p>Most cite the first paper, because it introduced the core concepts. Some cite the first paper but actually implement the correct solution from the second paper without even realizing there was a problem, because they combined the principles with their own mathematical understanding rather than duplicating the exact steps in the paper. Still others cite both papers.<p>How does this hypothetical dependency graph incorporate those details?<p>That paper is a simple one, because it really is a single algorithm for a single goal. Many papers introduce multiple concepts, solutions, or observations. It can well be that one of them was wrong while the others were correct, interesting, and influential. For example, in one paper I read the authors did not include a test case because, they said, the source material was invalid. I investigated, and discovered that it was due to a transcription error by the authors of the paper, and not a problem in the source material.<p>The addition of that one data point would have no material impact on the overall paper. But it&#x27;s still wrong.<p>How does his hypothetical dependency graph capture the multitude of disprovable points in the average paper? How does it capture what the &quot;pillars&quot; are?<p>Bear in mind that there&#x27;s been over 50 years of attempts to do this, so I think there&#x27;s no easy answer.",1430749751

9486296,comment,9485237,9485934,0,0,crdb,,,"Two reasons are generally put forward.<p>The argument put forward by Lee Kuan Yew (RIP) for exiling communists was that Maoist China was aggressively attempting to expand into the region. For example, see the Hong Kong bombing campaign of 1967 [1]. According to, amongst others, &quot;The Singapore Story&quot; [2], he was initially contacted by the Communists to represent them as a &quot;moderate&quot; leftist. His manoeuvering to win the 1959 election (scaring many businesses away to KL, thinking communism had won) and kick them out relatively bloodlessly thereafter has become legendary in Singapore, and is I think unparalleled anywhere else in the world. Part of winning included controlling the press and winning the PR battle. Whether it was justified depends on your stance on communism (and therefore if you consider the country to have been at war, suspending individual rights).<p>The second is that the island is racially very diverse, with a majority Chinese when both neighbours - who were also aggressive at the time - were of a different race and religion. Independence came a couple years too early due to Malaysian worries that LKY was not cooperating with their policies (Singapore was openly advocating racial equality amongst other things, against the pro-Malay discriminative policies from KL). Still in the 1960s, there was an explosion of anti-Chinese minority riots in neighbouring countries which involved some lynchings, and some Chinese had the idea of doing the same to Malays in Singapore (e.g. [3]). LKY&#x27;s response was prompt: he pushed for the Chinese rioters to be made an example of. Restrictions on hate speech grew from a need to quell these tensions. There were no more race riots until the recent incident where a drunk construction worker was run over by a bus and the mob got angry.<p>It&#x27;s important to view his actions not as if you lived in the prosperous United States, surrounded by a large ocean and coming out victorious from the largest war known to mankind but as the leader of a tiny island surrounded by enemies big and small, open and insidious. I ask his critics what they would have done differently; I personally agree with those who consider LKY one of the greatest politicians that ever lived, and I admire the Singaporeans for electing him year after year.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_1967_Leftist_riots"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_1967_Leftist_riots</a>: &quot;Bomb disposal experts from the police and the British military defused as many as 8,000 home-made bombs.

In this case it&#x27;s using technology and data to a higher degree to streamline the BS teachers have to deal with so they can get on with teaching. That&#x27;s cool and definitely a step above 99% of schools out there, but not a revolution in the Montessori sense.<p>I wish more people would grok the basic principles of Montessori and just focus on doing those right - because when it&#x27;s done well its perfect and really doesn&#x27;t take much structure. My wife runs a Montessori school from our home and has been a teacher for almost 12 years now. She has found that the more hands on she is (and other teachers are) with the students, the worse the outcomes are. As practitioners we see a lot of junk that claims to be &quot;Montessori&quot; but doesn&#x27;t really stick to the principles. These are primarily: self directed learning and building a community for exploration and creativity.<p>The best Montessori schools have agreements with local warehouses/mills/shops etc... where children can do internships and apprenticeships. Having &quot;curricula&quot; like the article states is generally antithetical to that and kills a large portion of what makes Montessori so successful - which is pupils taking prepared &quot;vocational&quot; paths which are liberal in educational scope. It&#x27;s simpler in the long run but takes much more up-front work and I think the technology is there to make that up-front work much easier.<p>The real challenge is fitting these types of schools into the larger &quot;schooling&quot; world of standardized tests etc... One thing we found was that many students leave Montessori because the clearest path into college is through the testing system and Monetssori doesn&#x27;t play well with that.

McDonalds is 4 things:<p>1) One of the largest derivatives players that isn&#x27;t doing it as their main source of revenue, ie they aren&#x27;t a hedge fund.  You will directly affect the commodities market.<p>2) One of hte largest property holders in the world, if your bet goes wrong you&#x27;ll screw up what is in effect one of the worlds largest REITS.<p>3) an employer of a mind boggling large number of people.  Make the wrong move and you just put a alrge portion of the lower wage community out of a job.<p>4) a company worth 94 billion by market cap.  When you run a company that large you don&#x27;t get to make brash decisions without the boards approval.<p>So if you make the decision to improve the quality of food you serve, you&#x27;ll have a few side effects.<p>1) you&#x27;ll shock the commodities markets, maybe this is good or bad, not sure.  But it will take you a minimum of 3 years I&#x27;m imagining before you can see meaningful change as food contracts are usually long term.<p>2) you&#x27;ll run a very real risk of pushing someone else out of the market as there is only so much of each food substance produced.  ie if McDonalds announced they were only going to use a better quality of chicken and beef then the first thing I&#x27;d do is short chipotle, and short them hard,  as if a supplier has the choice of upsetting McDonals or Chipotle, they will short change Chipotle every single time.<p>3) you run the risk of alienating your bread and butter customer, lower income people who are price sensitive to hamburger prices going from $1.50 to $3.<p>4) You are a dividend paying company, which means the market doesn&#x27;t expect growth in any area expect your dividend.  Fail in this regard and you will be punished heavily.  If you fail in your better food quality push you may just shave off 20 Billion in market cap.<p>TL/DR it takes alot of courage to change the MCDonalds menu!!",1430748642

Looks to me like you are not interested in a system with low transaction fees but one to maximize your mining profits.<p>Centralization Death Spiral: The amount of data to keep around depends on the number of transactions, not the block size. The larger block size only ever matters if the smaller block size gets saturated. And then you either increase the block size or you run a system that is constantly overloaded. Higher demand will cause higher fees and may push a couple of transactions that are not worth the costs out but in the long run you will make your users unhappy if their transactions are not executed unless they throw a lot of fees at them. And after all 1 TB per year is not exactly a huge amount of data.<p>Block Subsidy, Fees, and Blockchain Security: Bitcoin is by its very nature an expensive system. Not sure what the current costs per transactions are but they used to be on the order of $10 per transaction. None of the often mentioned target audiences of Bitcoin - unbanked people in poor areas, people looking for low transaction costs, micro payment services - is willing to pay that once the block reward is gone. Then you face the choice - reduce the hash rate or process more transactions, nothing else we reduce transaction costs. Especially not more efficient and cheaper mining hardware in case you want to maintain the security level because attackers will gain the same advances.",1430748454

Without an understanding of these in today&#x27;s world of the communications and the internet, you may as well not understand how to program at all.

Then they filled in the zip code and saw that it fetched the city/state and then realized how it worked then went back to delete it from the street name field.<p>Also, in the U.S., some zip codes can return multiple cities and states.

5339325,comment,5338576,5339048,9,0,dragonwriter,,,"> NULL is one of the most powerful features of SQL.<p>I'd argue that NULL is, from a logical perspective, the single most broken feature of SQL.<p>> It simply means a lack of data.<p>The semantics of NULLs are less straightforward than that, and have a poor relationship to how SQL actually treats them. Every table with one or more nullable columns really should be a table with all the non nullable columns, plus additional table with each combination of columns that would never be missing together, each of which has a foreign key relationship back to the first table.<p>That's for the simple case, where the semantics of missing data are always consistent for any set of columns; in real-world databases there are often more than one reason data that can be missing might be missing, and those different reasons (because they are different classes of fact), for any given column or set of columns to which they apply, each call for another table with a foreign key reference to the table containing only the mandatory columns.<p>> So, for example, if you were providing a survey with an optional question with a yes/no answer. NULL would mean ""no answer"", false would mean ""no"", and true would mean ""yes"". Storing the ""no answer"" as a false would be incorrect since they did not answer the question.<p>Sure, storing it as one table with all the questions as columns and storing the ""no"" answer when the answer was missing would be an error. If all the questions aren't required for the survey to be valid, then -- from a logical perspective -- the problem is presenting the whole thing as a single relation in the first place. Its a set of relations, that share a key (but not necessarily all <i>values</i> of the key.)",1362681844

Failing to collect and report sales tax can come with very hefty fines.<p>There's a whole bunch of other valid reasons too.  If there's a problem, it's nice being able to actually contact your customer.  Most businesses need to be able to produce receipts, with some data needed to even count as a receipt (""you were charged X on Y"" via email -- which you may not have anyway -- usually doesn't cut it).<p>And I'd love to see the data on this, but if someone has gotten to the point where they've decided to purchase and are presented with fields that are pretty standard just about everywhere else, I suspect abandonment rate is rather low.

QABot uses real browser and gets the monitoring as close as possible to real usage. At it's core, QABot is based on Selenium, an open source web browser automation tool. When we say monitoring, we mean more than checking http statuses and response times, we mean Continuous Validation of web apps, of rules defined by you using Selenium IDE.<p>To get started you need an account and a valid Selenium IDE test case (*.html file).

First (and most evocatively, I think) is the drug metaphor: the effects of the Ring are cumulative, and they also grow stronger in proximity to Orodruin. We can model the Ring as an involuntary opioid dispenser that is certainly harming Frodo's body cumutively. But, even more sinisterly, it's dosage is increasing in proximity to Mt. Doom. Clearly, if Frodo approaches Orodruin with high velocity, his ""dose"" of the Ring's power will become very, very high, and he will OD.<p>The second way to see this is a physics metaphor. In this case we model the Ring's action as a spring pushing away from Orodruin. Frodo uses his will to compress the spring. Each step he takes requires work. Frodo can only expend energy at a more-or-less fixed rate[1] (which is nicely called will <i>power</i>, and captures the same notion of work-over-time), so, as expected, his progress toward Mt. Doom slows considerably as the opposing force increases. (I would add that consuming nothing but lembas made the final leg of the trip even possible).<p>So, an eagle ride would have either a) resulted in Frodo overdose, or b) forced Frodo's mind to exceed it's capacity for work, snapping it and either killing him or letting the Ring take over.<p>[1] <a href=""http://psyserv06.psy.sbg.ac.at:5916/fetch/PDF/10978569.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psyserv06.psy.sbg.ac.at:5916/fetch/PDF/10978569.pdf</a>",1362681146

5339212,comment,5333508,5335824,1,0,SilasX,,,"Right, some claims don't generalize as I've indicated, but most that we actually see, do.  I should have perhaps used those examples the first time around.<p>The most typical one is, ""Raising the minimum wage, because it is the law, will mean that employees who previously made $x will make the new wage $y [rather than just be laid off or new jobs not created in anticipation of having to pay $y in the future].""  It's clear that this claim -- existing in the economic models in the minds of the typical proponent, is too strong, and thus false.  It is thus very appropriate to point out it's too strong by picking an arbitrarily high value for $y and showing that the economy ""just doesn't work like that"" -- that no law can make someone <i>worth</i> hiring at $y, so the typical need-based (""living wage"") argument is wholly irrelevant, much to the frustration of those of us trying to have a serious exchange on the issue.<p>The implicit model that you gave -- in which the typical min wage worker is underpaid relative to the (<i>appropriately discounted</i>) marginal revenue they produce would indeed imply that raising it will not (typically) mean job loss (or forgone job creation i.e. ""outsourcing"" work to a new hire).<p>It's also an extremely unrealistic model.  If it were true, that would mean any firm can steal the profits of other firms by bidding up worker income.  That they don't, would imply that competition for low-skill labor is weaker than for other labor, when all evidence indicates this is the opposite of the truth.<p>So yes, the arguments raised by responses to this reductio reveal the weakness of the case for raising the minimum wage.  I'd call that a fruitful point, not a strawman.",1362680738

You cannot set the default with anything better than random accuracy, and each box probably has at least 10 options.  Additionally, the expiration date box says ""2 - February"".  I have a lot of credit cards, and none of them say the name of the month on it, only the number.

Let's say your chargeback rate goes from 0.1% to 0.2%, but your conversion rate goes from 50% to 60%, then you come out way ahead.<p>In our experience, you can stop most fraud without putting up roadblocks for your users. Every site is different, but to give an example, we were able detect 90% of fraud for a site with a huge fraud problem without requiring any extra verification from the users.<p>The really key penalty to avoid is what is called an ""excessive chargeback program,"" which usually triggers for chargeback rates that exceed 1%. You initially get a warning, and if you can't get your chargeback rate down, your payment processor has the right to shut you off. If you're in an excessive chargeback program, then I'd definitely recommend ""playing it safe.""<p>But otherwise, I think slimming down your payment form and carefully measuring the effect on fraud is almost always a smart business move.",1362680562

5339152,comment,5337380,5338242,6,0,Dave_Rosenthal,,,"> The point is simply to show how SSDs can't be considered, currently, as a bit slower version of memory. Their performance characteristics are a lot more about, simply, ""faster disks"".<p>I come to the opposite conclusion when thinking about SSD's place between memory and disk. Let's talk about random I/O, which is the relevant metric for Redis: Yes, memory is a lot faster than SSDs (roughly 2+ orders of magnitude), but SSDs are also a whole lot faster than disk (roughly 2+ orders of magnitude). That makes them sound like they are sort of ""in the middle"".<p>But, let's look at another crucial property: something that I'll call the ""characteristic size"". This is the bytes of data such that the ""seek cost"" is equal to the cost of reading the bytes. You get this number by dividing the scan speed by IOps. I'll work in very rough numbers:<p>Memory:    20GB/s / 20M iops = 1Kb<p>SSD:       500MB/s / 100K iops = 5Kb<p>7K Disk:  160MB/s / 160 iops = 1000Kb<p>As you can see, SSDs are much more like memory than disk in this crucial parameter which dictates what data structures and algorithms will be most efficient.<p>So, actually, do I think of an SSD as more like slower memory than a fast disk.<p>* edit: Typo",1362680232

He has an experience that might be applicable to people who did not see the first link (like me, I come to HN multiple times a day but did not see the previous link or comment).<p>Pointing this out seems akin to hanging out with a friend in multiple social settings and when he tells a story you have heard before but the group hasn't, you stop him and tell him he's told that before.",1362679499

You probably want to pass around a pointer, anyway, so that you're not copying values over each time.<p>Sure, I'm not saying that the extra allocation will always <i>matter</i>. In most cases it won't. My point is just that this type system workaround does cost some performance. For example, a heap-allocated struct that contains two nullable ints using the pointer trick has 3 heap allocations, not one.<p>> Sure you can - that's literally what the NullBool, etc. types do<p>But that has to be done for each type. If you define a custom type Foo and want a nullable version, you have to write the NullFoo boilerplate yourself. This is what generics are for.",1362679478

Doom to intercept the eagles).""",1362679400

A date is not an appointment; an appointment <i>has</i> a date associated with it, and many other things.  Appointments do not change either:  they are canceled and rescheduled (which means making a <i>new</i> appointment).<p>The problem with C and C++ having the <i>const</i> keyword is that it is overly restrictive and is not flexible enough.  What you are trying to express with <i>const</i> is that the value of an object before a computation is equivalent to its value after the computation, under some definition of equivalence.  What <i>const</i> actually says is that the object will not change <i>at all</i>.  C++ tries to mitigate this with <i>mutable</i>, but this is too rigid:  the same things are mutable or immutable regardless of the context.<p>What we really need is what you see in specification languages:  the ability to declare precisely how a value is modified by an operation.

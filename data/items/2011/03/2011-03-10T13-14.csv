Many of the first great comet apps were built on twisted.  But you really have to work at using twisted - the docs aren't great, the reactor / deferred patterns take some time getting used to, and finally and most importantly the community isn't effective in evangelizing their product (sorry Glyph)<p>Another issue seems to be timing.  Low latency apps have a current buzz and you see people rediscovering old collaborative ideas like Push to talk (referenced in the article).  I wish them luck - PTT has failed spectacularly in the past but maybe will have a strong second life in a world full of smartphones.  Node.js seems to riding this wave - and the backers leveraging the buzz to drive interest in the platform.<p>I also wonder if location is an issue.  The Twisted team had a strong core in Boston while the Node interest seems to be coming out of the valley - and leveraging that environment's idea pressure cooker.<p>It also seems that node.js would benefit from a good implementation of the generator pattern that would enable you to write asynchronous code in a (somewhat) iterative style.  Unfortunately I don't think that V8 implements any of the ecmascript extensions pioneered by Mozilla that implement yield, list comprehensions, and other fun stuff.",1299765596

If we take your landing page as an elevator pitch, the feedback you get will mostly consist of obvious concerns, such as:<p>Won't that devolve into piratebay with a chatroom?
How will you pay for the huge bandwidth and storage required?
Will people want to chat ad-hoc with strangers while they're downloading?
Do people want others to know what they're downloading?
How can you make this legal AND interesting?<p>But those concerns are largely shots in the dark. We don't know what you got planned. So I guess the question is more: Do you believe in the idea? Do you believe you can make this work? If so, you shouldn't give the reins to naysayers, show what you can do; go ahead and try it out, by all means!

Person sees link. Waits for 30 seconds for it to be available and then sets it to download and continues with whatever they might be supposed to be doing.<p>So here come the questions
1) are you solving a problem? Or is this a novel idea you think might be cool? If it's the former then what is the problem? If it is the latter the next question will be even more relevant
2) typical file share downloads won't last more than 15 minutes. Minimum a minute. Average somewhere around 4 minutes. Why would people want to chat for that time?
3) given that people set stuff to download and move along you have to be adding value to what peoples time if you expect them to devote time to chatting instead. What's the value you add?<p>I will never shoot down an idea outright so go ahead and answer without worrying that I'll cream over you.

2309047,comment,2308044,2308044,0,0,notahacker,,,"Outsider perspective here:<p>The thing is, Singapore has done very well out of MNCs and government-backed large enterprises. Its comparative advantage over the rest of the world is in efficient implementation rather than innovation, and it achieves the former through values that are not conducive to innovation (central-planning, regulation, conformity). And it's a model that works so well for Singaporeans there's perhaps very little incentive to deviate from it either for entrepreneurs <i>or investors</i>. The country <i>collectively</i> went from ""rags to riches"" within the memories of the parents that most twentysomething Singaporeans live with, without a single Gates or Jobs to point to inspire individualism. Singapore's rich list is dominated by people who earned their fortunes through banking or smart property investments, and their highly-skilled job market is dominated by the finance sector, which pays very nicely.<p>At worst that can breed a sense of entitlement where not only is failure (the <i>expectated</i> outcome for any budding entrepreneur) inconceivable, but steady career progression is believed to be guaranteed simply by having the requisite qualities and turning up. A friend who headed up recruitment for an MNC noted how brazen young Singaporeans (by contrast to both immigrants to Singapore or job applicants in the Western world) were about stating that a percentage increase in salary was their prime/only motivation for wanting the job. Compare that with your average startup story where people are enthusiastic about working longer hours for less money for the challenge and the freedom - are these people as easy to find in Singapore?<p>Of course, that creates plenty of opportunities for those that do want to break out from the norm - it's a climate which is business-friendly, you can speak both the world's most important business languages fluently, the <i>basic</i> costs of living are cheap compared with much of the developed world, and if you've got the cash there's no shortage of smart, well-educated people to hire at lower rates than San Francisco.",1299764023

I think finding the root cause is far more important than differentiating between reasons and excuses, or belittling people because you think their reasons aren't good enough.<p>Example: ""Laptop ran out of battery"" - is that really a bad excuse? What if there aren't enough charging points in the office, so not everyone can keep their laptops topped up all at the same time? Analysing the surface reason alone is not enough to know whether it has merit, there may be a valid root cause for what appears to be a poor excuse.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys</a>",1299763945

Thanks, Daniel, for saying what I was thinking, far better than I could have.<p>I feel fortunate that my DNA is blessed with some sort of internal ""governor"".  I don't know where it came from, but I've always had it.  Here's how it works:  It stays out of the way when I am enthusiastic about something, allowing me work ridiculous hours and pursue almost anything that looks promising, whether it makes sense or not.  But when I reach a certain point, it turns me off, completely.  I don't seem to have conscious judgement of what that point is or when I reach it, but when it happens, I know.<p>A few examples:<p>- I have worked many times without sleep, preparing for a launch.  Sometimes, I know my judgement is failing and continuing would cause more problems in the long run.  So I stopped and apologize to everyone.  I went to sleep and informed everyone that the project would resume at x.  I'm not really sure exactly what happened, but I know I had little control over the governor.<p>- I had 2,500 invoices spread across the carpet, looking for a clue about a bug.  After 8 hours, everything was fuzzy.  So I just gathered up the invoices, filed them away, and went to sleep.  Three days later a lightbulb went off, I spread out 100 of the invoices, and found the problem in 15 minutes.  I know that if I had continued that night, I never would have found the problem.<p>- I worked 90 hours per week for 2 months for a big deployment.  Without telling me, my co-founder spent all of our reserves travelling to a customer site to oversee the install.  He emailed me every 20 minutes with a problem.  Between being pissed off at him and exhausted from working on the wrong things, I realized the project was going nowhere and would never succeed.  So I just stopped working completely.  I went to bed and didn't answer email for 4 days.  I'm not proud of this, just one more story about my internal governor.<p>I'm a little frustrated that I don't have much control over my governor, but also a little relieved that it does it's thing.  After all, I've never really been burnt out, and I'm still going strong.  Thank you, governor.",1299762241

516899,comment,516215,516712,0,0,cschwarm,,,"Well, what do you consider a proper explanation?<p>The core theory is in fact quite simple: People have a (serious) problem to solve and the text presents the product as a solution to these problems by pointing out its benefits. In other words: People are expected to be self-interested.<p>Of course, potential buyers also wonder whether the product will deliver. Since media is not interactive, you have to deal with typical objections up front. Thus, these latters tend to be rather long.<p>Next, you'd need the attention of the audience. Thus, you make (lots of sub-) headlines that are easy to scan and makes readers interested. Among others, curiosity is often induced to make people willing to read the rest of the text. ""Do you make these mistakes in English"" is a classic example. The magic word here is of course ""these"". It promises an answer in the text without revealing it yet.<p>In the text, you can use typical sales tactics to overcome buyers' fear of later remorse. Caldini's 'Influence' describes the common 6 tactics.<p>For example, people tend to buy from people they like. One way to make people like the seller is to point out similarities. Thus, the seller often uses a profile similar to the buyers -- in the above example: ""Natalie ('A Parrot Lover For The Last 12 Years')"". This also establishes the seller as an authority -- 12 years is quite some time to gain experience and thus she probably knows what she's talking about.<p>Additionally, you have a clear call to action. For some reason, people are either unable to figure out what to do next or they are willing to obey commands.<p>And that's it, basically.<p>As far as I know there's no agreement about an explanation on why these tactics work. Why do people obey commands by authorities? You may construct an explanation based on the different models of economic or biological or psychological behavior.<p>But it's hard to test which of those (if any) is the one 'true' explanation.",1237131715
516898,comment,516215,516804,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"Yeah. It's a category that people certainly have an incentive to care about.  I wonder if there are laws that prevent claims like, ""Learn the true secrets of diabetes management.""  Also, you'd be competing with WebMD and other free and legit sources.<p>Yesterday on the TeeVee, I saw an ad for a DVD on how to make one's child behave himself. Given that we have a 3 1/2 year-old who is a terror, I paused to evaluate the claims made.  Perhaps mental health-related stuff would get around the ""playing doctor"" problem?  I mean light claims like ""feel better"" rather than ""cure your depression.""<p>Not that I actually want to do any business like this...I'm no better at it than the next guy.

516890,comment,516215,516646,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"As someone elsewhere on this thread has pointed out: If this guy sold the books under his own name, and his own name happened not to be ""Joe Smith"" but rather ""Rajesh Bhatnagar""... people in Middle America [1] would not be as likely to buy his book. Despite the fact that there could obviously be plenty of people with Indian-sounding names, great writing skill, and a knowledge of parrots.<p>If working under a pseudonym is a ""fraud"" then a lot of great writers were frauds: Charles Dodgson, Samuel Clemens, Stephen King, Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, a sizeable percentage of the artists who draw your newspaper's comic strips, and 100% of the authors of the Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys books, among others. Many musicians are ""frauds"" (Farrokh Bulsara, Robert Zimmermann, Reginald Dwight), including most famous rap musicians. Half of Hollywood is a a ""fraud"": Frances Gumm, Archibald Leach, Margarita Cansino, Marion Morrison, Allen Konigsberg, Carlos Est√©vez, Maurice Mickelwhite.<p>(Sorry about the flood of examples. I just can't resist them. Isn't it fun how much less bland the world looks if we just remove the whitewash? But, alas, I can't blame Marion Morrison for deciding that he'd sell more tickets as ""John Wayne"", because I don't doubt that fact for a minute.)<p>As we've seen, many pseudonyms were chosen precisely to hide the author's true race or gender from the buying public: George Sand, George Eliot. And there's an analogous practice: the creative use of initials. (Especially common for women trying to break in to SF/F. Isn't that interesting?) Thus, Joanne Rowling publishes as ""J.K. Rowling"" [2], Carolyn Cherry's 60-odd works of SF are published as ""C.J. Cherryh"" [3], and Celia Friedman writes as ""C.S. Friedman"".<p>---<p>[1] I single out Middle America because it's the place I know -- I was born and raised in Ohio. I'm sure Middle America isn't the only place where this is true.<p>[2] Of course, this doesn't fool anyone anymore in her case.<p>[3] According to Wikipedia, the extra ""h"" is there because ""Cherry"" sounded too much like a <i>romance</i> novelist's name.",1237130959

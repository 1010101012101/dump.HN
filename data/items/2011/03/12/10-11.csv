If anyone out there can point me at a better source for this data, I'd be most grateful.<p>As a preliminary indicator of my findings, I've gathered start-up dates (and shut-down dates for reactors that are no longer operational) for the 12 reactors in countries that start with ""A"", yielding some 322 reactor-years of operation. If 12 of the 500-ish civilian, non-experimental reactors, including decommissioned, in the world have a combined 322 reactor-years of criticality, let's guesstimate that there's been something on the order of 12000 reactor-years of criticality globally, across all non-experimental, non-military reactors.<p>In that time, there have been 27 civilian nuclear ""accidents"" (defined as damage to persons or property directly attributable to something Going Wrong at a reactor), and 8 -- count them, <i>eight</i> -- ""incidents"" (defined as something Going Wrong at a reactor, but not causing damage to persons or property outside the plant, itself).  (Again, this data is from Wikipedia, so its accuracy is open to debate.)<p>Given the choice between one ""accident"" every 500-odd reactor-years (again, take that number with a cup of salt), and continually pumping ten <i>gigatons</i> of <i>just</i> CO2 into the atmosphere every year -- and that just from coal-burning power plants -- I know which I'd prefer.<p>That said, I agree with you on one point: we damn well should be investing massively more than we are into ""green"" energy technology. Much of that is unproven, and often has its own set of ecological consequences. Even leaving that aside, the best estimates say it will be decades, at least, before any of it can even <i>start</i> to supplant current energy sources.<p>What, exactly, should we do in the interim?<p>(EDIT: math is hard past 0300.)",1299924612

He shapes the reality on his own image and beliefs. It's not easy to grasp the whole concept, specially considering that everybody is projecting different realities and they have to be combined together, but to me this just confirms that the world is based on contradictions and if we are able to accept those contradictions we will understand more, but we will never understand everything.

Oftentimes, when people ask a question, questioning their motives <i>is</i> a good idea. I know that when I ask a question, I often discover that I'm trying to solve the wrong problem.<p>A very common pattern on SO is that the accepted answer is a practical solution to the problem, and the highest-rated answer is a longer talk about whether this is something the questioner even needs to do.",1299924019

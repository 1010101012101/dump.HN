I was naive and thought that I could build one like WoW single handedly and I soon realized that I couldn't. However I did then come across private servers for games like World of Warcraft. From that I started to learn how to run them, I started to learn about SQL to manage the DB, then moved onto to learning LUA in order to script for my server. Even going onto looking into C++. Even then moving onto learning about web development and web servers in order to run the site for my server. That's what sparked my curiosity in coding and development at a young age.<p>That's why I disagree with this statement. People will learn that they can't build a game just like that, but they make start to take smaller steps and learn themselves. Don't discourage people from trying.

I call it importance overload because that's what it is: when everything looks the same and feels the same, everything becomes the same importance. And when you have 1000 items of the same importance, nothing is important. This is a design paradigm used on information. I think it works well to describe the problem.</i><p>You stated the problem very well - if everything looks equally important then nothing is.... so don't do that ;-)<p>I've easily about 500 items organised on various kanban style boards ATM (not all in trello). That's actually pretty low for us. I've worked with places that successfully do this with many, many more than that.<p>The thing that the OP missed in comparing droptask to trello and similar tools is that you're not just making lists - you're modelling the process you're using to do work too. For me droptask makes it harder to deal with that information overload - not easier - since it seems to be focused on task categorisation - not workflow modelling.<p>When I'm looking at our company's current-work board I can see - at a glance - what folk are doing right now (the WIP column), what's blocked (the blocked column), what's been done in the last seven days or so (done), and what's coming up in the next week or so (on deck column) and so on.<p>Once a week we make sure the backlog on that board is topped up with another week's worth of work from a separate general-work board. Takes an hour tops as part of our weekly retrospective. Usually more like ten minutes.<p>With have a few class-of-service rules that decide whether incoming work goes onto the current-work board or the general work board.<p>Once a month we spend an afternoon sanity checking the general work board against our company goals and cull / re-prioritise as appropriate.<p>(It's a little bit more complicated than this - since we have some external public-facing boards we use for client work and some volunteer efforts we're involved with, plus create separate boards for one-off tasks like recruitment and for tracking our consulting sales funnel, etc).<p>In short I find that prioritised lists are a stupidly effective for visualising our workflow. Droptask seems to only have date-based ordering which is a <i>very</i> blunt - and often counter productive - tool to help prioritise work.<p>It seems a step backwards to me.",1362102673

Not everyone goes on to become an author and I won't expect everyone to go on to be professional programmers. I think the push back against this trend is due to the uncertainty surrounding how a movement like this will change the industry. Like you said it will empower people and I think one of the ways this can change things, in a good way, is by allowing services to be centered more around APIs so that everyone can build and customize tools the exact way they like.<p>Take for example todo list software, there will always be many offerings because everyone has a certain way they like to go about it. If you can program then you can customize the experience for your particular case while the data (the key resource being shared in the case of teams) remains the same.

I will point out that it also contains no such reports, and doesn't contradict my point.<p>> But it's also common sense, right? It is not controversial that the Taliban operate death squads. If you want to say NATO does too, fine, but that doesn't change the implications of the document dump. It does in fact create a list of specific people subject to reprisal killings by a group that is world famous for targeted reprisal killings on a scale even the US Army (in your least charitable interpretation) would have difficulty rivaling.<p>This is not a discussion about whether the US Army or the Taliban is worse. I'm not really interested in taking a position on that. You're kind of creating a straw man there.<p>> Still another response to your criticism is that you've set an unreasonably high bar. How many Pashtun residence of Paktia province do you know? I don't know many. How well reported to you think Ghazni province is compared to LA County? You're suggesting that we not take harm seriously until an extremely thin layer of journalists can document that harm carefully. Well, that's never going to happen. 60% of every Pashtun person identified by the document dump could already have been murdered and we wouldn't know.<p>I feel like although this makes sense, you didn't actually think about what you are suggesting. Yes, I do believe that in order to claim that someone is responsible for people getting hurt, you need <i>some indication</i> that it actually happened. Speculating about what horrible things <i>could</i> have happened is essentially an unbounded thought experiment that has no relevance. We have enough actual problems to worry about, let's not waste resources over hypothetical problems.<p>Note that I didn't even set a bar - I'm just pointing out that there hasn't even been a whisper of an actual papercut from a friend of a friend. Nothing. Given the propensity of people on both sides to exaggerate in order to further their agendas, the fact that there was nothing reported speaks volumes to me anyway.<p>Sure, it's common sense that they're going to look for traitors in the documents, but it's within the bounds of reason that one could take the position that they had a high probability of getting out of harms way, relative to the greater good that said person feels would come of releasing the documents. Of course, this is taking a chance, and reasonable people can disagree about whether or not that was acceptable risk. In this case, however, the ""for releasing"" position would have been correct as far as anybody seems to know.<p>> Julian Assange is alleged to have sat in a room full of journalists and said ""Well, they're informants. So, if they get killed, they've got it coming to them. They deserve it."" That seems like an easy claim for some journalist who was at the table to have knocked down. Has that happened, or is it likely that Assange actually said that? The journalist who made that allegation was David Leigh, investigations editor or The Guardian. FRONTLINE ran the claim in their documentary. Do you think FRONTLINE didn't fact-check?<p>What does a statement made by Julian Assange have to do with this?<p>I'm saying it's invalid reasoning to continue making serious attacks based on what ""might happen"", especially when the time during which said incidents would likely occur has now passed, and it never did happen as far as anyone seems to know.<p>The particular claim that I am addressing charges that his decision <i>potentially</i> caused unacceptable collateral damage. I am not taking a position on whether or not releasing the documents was justified or whether or not Assange is an egomaniac who doesn't shower. If one's position is that he should not have released these, it's bullshit to justify that position with this particular claim.",1362102123

5302278,comment,5301688,5301688,30,0,JoshTriplett,,,"A quick summary of the difference between this and existing implementations of deflate such as gzip or zlib:<p>Deflate combines two compression techniques: Huffman coding to replace each value with a string of bits whose length depends on the frequency of that value, and backreferences of the form ""go back N bytes and repeat M bytes from there"".  (Glossing over a pile of fun interactions between those two, such as Huffman-coding both literals and backreferences, and Huffman-coding the Huffman tables.  Not to mention the ability to have M > N, repeating the earlier parts of the thing you backreferenced.  See RFC1951, <a href=""https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951</a> , for the full details.)<p>Existing deflate implementations use various heuristics to guess when they should encode the next bit of data as a literal symbol or a backreference, such as a hash table of possible strings to backreference; the compression level (-1 through -9) tunes those heuristics to take more or less time, most notably by changing the lengths of strings stored and searched for for in the hash table.<p>Zopfil says it uses ""more exhaustive compression techniques"" based on ""iterating entropy modeling and a shortest path search algorithm to find a low bit cost path through the graph of all possible deflate representations.""  The entropy modeling allows Zopfil to estimate the effectiveness of a given approach to deflate.  The path-search algorithm effectively treats the space of all possible deflate representations as a single-player game, with ""moves"" that change the representation in some incremental way, and then uses standard search algorithms to find a near-optimal representation.<p>(Without reading the source in detail, I don't know whether the search space includes the choice of Huffman tables, the set of possible backreferences, or both.  I can see how either one could map onto a search space, though.)",1362101464

To repeat, we probably won't ever get proof of any particular death from the leaks, but we knew the leaks included information on groups of people that we know bad guys were actively seeking out for jailing, torturing, and killing, and so the odds are high that some are or will be killed from the leaks.<p>It's similar to the way we can conclude that smoking has killed people via lung cancer, even though it is impossible or nearly so to pin any particular lung cancer death on smoking.

5302196,comment,5301305,5301961,15,0,gdb,,,"(I work at Stripe.)<p>As an API author, I think your goal should be to make interacting with your API as simple and robust as possible. The downside with just recommending off-the-shelf HTTP clients is that there's always a ton of logic (whether request formatting, error handling, or turning responses into first-class objects) that the vast majority of consumers of your API want and will have to write on their own. If you look at the internals of our bindings, a lot of the logic is around understanding exceptions (<a href=""https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby/blob/master/lib/stripe.rb#L244"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby/blob/master/lib/stripe...</a>) or interstanding semantics of our API (<a href=""https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby/blob/master/lib/stripe.rb#L214"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby/blob/master/lib/stripe...</a>), which are tasks that would take a newcomer a lot of time to get get spun up on.<p>There will always be frameworks where your bindings don't work (e.g. our Ruby bindings aren't compatible with EventMachine) or paradigms that they violate (e.g. using error return values in PHP rather than throwing exceptions). That's actually ok -- just because you can't support everyone doesn't mean you should support no one. Instead, we put a lot of effort into making our bindings compatible with as broad of a range of environments as possible (e.g. <a href=""https://github.com/stripe/stripe-python/blob/master/stripe/__init__.py#L28"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/stripe/stripe-python/blob/master/stripe/_...</a>).<p>So my advice would be write bindings which convert the semantics of your API to the consumer's language, but which constrain the consumer's application as little as they can. Even if people end up having to use a lower-level abstraction to talk to your API, they can probably steal code or ideas from what you've written.",1362100200

Given 1.8 will be deprecated before the next release is out they won't have much choice but to use 1.9 then, or 2.0 maybe if its out.<p>Compare to the new(er) perl 5 releases, ruby 1.9 does change some core things. Take for example the ping class being removed in 1.9. In perl 5.10->5.14.1 all of the new things like ""say"" and the new case statement are things you have to explicitly request in a script which sort of implies you know you need it.

The book describes a post-scarcity economy: All the necessities (and most of the luxuries) of life are free. Whuffie has replaced money, providing a motivation for people to do useful and creative things. A person's Whuffie is a general measurement of his or her overall reputation and is gained (or lost) according to a person's favorable (or unfavorable) actions.<p><a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Whuffie"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Whuffie</a>",1311279069

Unless you find a set that magically fits your semantics, you will have to roll your own.  Think garbage collection, as well as hashes, lists, and strings.  That can be way more work than you want to get into.  I suggest picking a target language that better fits the semantics of your language.  Java, C++ or the like for a statically typed language or python for a dynamically typed language. Or Haskell, or lisp.<p>As the article mentions pay particular attention to debugging, even to compiler errors.  Put out line numbers, even if just comments.  Write the source statements as comments, because a syntax error in generated code can be hell on wheels to track down.  I know wherefore I speak.  I once wrote an application generator that generated embedded SQL, which in turn was translated into C with mountains of library calls (before the days of ODBC).  A syntax error in the ultimate C was often nasty.<p>If you want a debugger, be prepared to roll your own, unless your target language has serious support for generated languages.",1311278838

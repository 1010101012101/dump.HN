But games also have very narrowly defined win/loss conditions, and even in sandbox games (like <i>Grand Theft Auto</i>) success means that that players in the middle of the normal distribution are able to complete the game and interested enough to spend time doing so.<p>For creative or productivity software, the definition of success is open-ended, because while designers can anticipate the kind of tasks/problems users will want to perform/solve, the end product of their labors is fundamentally unknowable, rather than waiting within the software to be discovered by the diligent user (player). Sure, Michaelangelo used to say that the statue already existed within the block of marble and his job was simply to reveal it, but you should probably see that as an early example of successful branding rather than a design document. A game is like a theme park ride insofar as the riders may change but their interaction with the ride is highly constrained. An application is more like a civil engineering task insofar as it has to bear a substantial amount of traffic, but its job is to facilitate rather than fulfill. You want those things available on the toolbar, even though many of them may not see regular use, because it's the easiest way to signal the availability of such functionality.

We suggested a compromise where wed agree to never put any words in front of Scrolls, and instead call sequels and other things something along the lines of Scrolls - The Banana Expansion. Im not sure if they ever got back to us with a reply to this.</i><p><i>Today, I got a 15 page letter from some Swedish lawyer firm, saying they demand us to stop using the name Scrolls, that they will sue us (and have already paid the fee to the Swedish court), and that they demand a pile of money up front before the legal process has even started.</i><p>Firing up the internet hate machine wasn't the first thing Notch did.

We do a revenue share with the developers, so all you do is write the app, put up a link that has the url to your rails' app git repo, which branch to deploy from, and any environmental variables you want the app to launch with (so you can customize it at launch time), and then anyone can instantly launch the app. If they end up converting to premium hosting (based on a few factors like number of allowed user signins and apps), we'll split the revenue with you.<p>The goal is to help developers be more and more independent working on their projects of passion, and to app users way more choice in the apps they can use.<p>Let me know if you have any more questions, s@gobushido.com!",1314655550

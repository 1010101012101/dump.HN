30748,comment,30581,30747,0,0,Keios,,,"If the most important criteria for any seeding firm is how many startups exist in any given geographic area - I humbly disagree. It just indicates how easy it is to do business in a specific area, ideas and skills are not born in specific areas they occur universally. YC should actively look for great ideas from all over the world and then support the best, this may invlove moving them from thier current location, such as India, to one which is more conducive to thier pursuits, such as SV^^.The core competency for a YC type seeding company is to find talent and YCs primary service is to help hackers by providing an environment which gives them a shot. YC should be hunting for hackers who can create stuff that people want to pay for - in some fashion. Having existing startups IMO is not the criteria unless you wish to confound your judgment.<p>To summarize, you base your argument on a assumption that India should already be SV, while I think that is a superflous criteria for making great investment decisions as far as Tech startups go. I may well be wrong - but like you I try not to be blinkered.<p>PS: Please look at a wider spectrum when you talk of Tech Startups out of India, a great example is an IIT Chennai startup that works in a huge and untapped Indian rural market - can't recall the name. And that's just one, there are many more, I know of many tech startups out of New Delhi, who cater to an Indian audience.<p>^IMO Banglore and the Silicon Valley have very little in common - Indian tech startups are not yet geo-specific and may never be. Please don't compare Banglore with SV.<p>^^You may extend this logic to other industries and see that it works, Fashion comes to mind, Indian Fashion designers often also do work in Paris.",1182847648
30747,comment,30581,30708,0,0,Keios,,,"Chicken and egg indeed. Your perspective seems to be based on a very ""US"" centric view, which is perhaps one way to look at the issue. Needless to say entrepreneurial activity may not evolve in the same fashion in India as it did in the US. For example there may never be a specific area or city in India which becomes a Silicon Valley^(SV)<p>In the US specific areas/cities have historically done better in somethings - especially technology. This may never come to pass in India because of the presence of very different dynamics.<p>Also, you assume that India already has a world of startups - it does not, it merely has an untapped potential. I will not answer your question about programming languages that have come out of India, or Open Source intiatives - I would merely advise you to count how many Indians have contributed to similar goals in Silicon Valley, you could start back from the 1980s - I think oppurtunity called them to the US and they wisely followed. Also please check similar sources for linux, even the ubuntu flavor has Indians contributing. IMO in the future resident Indians will contribute to such projects, historically some non-resident Indians have. This is so because today's infrastructre allows us. (contd..)",1182847626

It's possible it was almost no one but them, but I think it was at least a small number of genuine users.<p>Another very similar example:<p>Wrigley's Chewing Gum used to sell soap, which people wanted, and he'd give customers some free gum as an extra. He realized that he could do a much bigger business in gum itself.<p>",1182847219

30741,comment,30693,30693,0,0,staunch,,,"It's obviously risky to go after hot markets, even though there's a lot of success to be had doing it. Joe Kraus says ""Better to be a trendspotter than a trendsetter"" and Marc is saying something like ""Make something people want, in a really hot market.""<p>So does the advantage of working in a hot market outweigh the advantage of solving a problem you personally have? I'm thinking it probably does. If you can make it past the initial hurdle on your own steam your ""hot market"" users can probably carry you to victory.\n",1182845865

Please let everyone know when you've got it working!-))<p>To the best of my knowledge there's no neural network technology available today currently that could be described as providing ""raw cognition"". Neural nets are for the most part focussed on backpropagation networks, which aren't prevalent in nature. The brain has much more variety in it's architecture.<p>Gerald M. Edelman has argued that a biological approach based on evolution and biology will prove more fruitful than the physical symbol system hypothesis(PSSH) of ""good old-fashioned AI"". Edelman explicates his ideas in ""Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On the Matter of the Mind"":<p>(<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Bright-Air-Brilliant-Fire-Matter/dp/0465007643/ref=sr_1_1/103-2087616-1051018?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1182842907&sr=1-1)."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Bright-Air-Brilliant-Fire-Matter/dp/0465007643/ref=sr_1_1/103-2087616-1051018?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1182842907&sr=1-1).</a> <p>In that book he clearly states his objections to the PSSH.<p>There is significant recent work on consciousness, tying it to neuroscience studies of the brain. Bernard J. Baars' explications of Global Workspace theory appear fruitful in leading us toward conscious computing.

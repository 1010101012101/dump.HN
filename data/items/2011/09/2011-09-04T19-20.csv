(Whoops.) I was employee #150 or so.<p>The second time as an employee, low-five-figures from the options, and close to $100K from a year's worth of retention bonus. Would've been more if I'd stayed for three years instead of one. Here I was around employee #100.<p>In both cases the startups were already mature when I arrived - not guaranteed to exit, but a stone rolling downhill. Whatever I made was gravy; I was paid at or close to market rate at both places.<p>In my opinion, employees do best at startups that've already had some success.

2960195,comment,2959540,2959540,1,0,s4yc,,,"Not sure if this is the case here, but in this business it's common that compensation is structured as:  base salary + guaranteed year-end bonus + performance-based year-end bonus.  The offer would include only the first two items.  The base salary should be similar to an average salary as a software engineer that you could get elsewhere.  The guaranteed part of the bonus can vary anywhere from 10% to 100% of your salary; it really depends on the company and your position (in your case, you should expect a lower number).  The non-guaranteed part of the bonus is where the real money can be found, though, and that cannot be negotiated.  It will be based on your personal performance and on the performance of the company each year.  So bargain carefully for the first two components of the compensation, but remember that the third component is where the real upside is.  In other words, especially with your almost non-existent experience (no disrespect), you should take whatever you can get from them.  Assuming that you want to work in that business, of course.  I hope this helps.",1315166236

2960186,comment,2947519,2958759,1,0,sixcorners,,,"> Declaring (inaccurately) that they're ""not true Christians"" doesn't help<p>So would it be accurate to say that your argument is that the brother harassing the divorced brother from this linked article and the ""god hates fags"" people are not true Christians because they do not take their beliefs from the same body of understanding as a group of theologians. However Christians who call themselves sheep and who would deny reason to uphold their own ""unreasonable"" nonmatching interpretation are still true Christians because they didn't do any of the things the group considers wrong even though embracing non-reason is one of the things that group detests. I guess I just think that the differences between the denominations are a lot larger then you do. Where the former is excluded for believing crazy unreasonable things, it seems like the latter should also be excluded on that same criteria.<p>Anyway, if one of the things that the true Christian crowd believe is that everyone is deserving of death then I'm not sure it matters. How can that be justified? Original sin?<p>>""falsifiability"" is a statement about theory, not about data.<p>I guess I should have said that their explanation of their experience is not falsifiable. I can't tell if that sound you heard was a ghost or white noise/pareidolia and you can't either.<p>>Also recall that a lot of types of data cannot be reproduced<p>Why should we need to rely on past data? What role does God take in the world today and how can we test for it? God giving GPS directions? Oh yes, I remember. He wants to prove that he exists, but not in a way that we will actually know right? ""That would take away free will."" It has to be a way that can also be explained by causes outside of God.<p>>Most of the seemingly huge disagreements between churches or denominations are actually small disagreements about how to balance multiple important factors<p>Like how many snakes to wield around at the next meetup or how to best cannibalise the blood and flesh of Jesus? I would think that the person who authored the mathematical laws of the universe would be the one most qualified to write how to perform an exorcism or a laying on of hands in a way that is understandable. That is the important stuff right? It made it in over stuff like germ theory. Now if you want rank and file, the Islam religion seems to have things going.

My wife is running a small business and she has been facing exactly the problems described in the article. Real customers posting real reviews but quickly disappearing in the filtered reviews for unknown reasons, some of her customers have been on Yelp for a while but still their reviews are filtered, while some competitors (we guess) post a negative review with what is most likely a fake account stayed, and are never filtered out.<p>Like in the article, my wife was contacted by Yelp to advertise, and she declined... Soon after some of the positive reviews vanished!<p>Yelp until a year or so ago didn't even let business owner reply to a negative review, so the power was in the hand of the reviewer. What is worst is that even with that in place, even if a fake review is posted and advertising for a competitive business which is against their TOS, Yelp simply do not care of removing such review.
Another area wher Yelp is doing a really poor job: it is still possible to review a closed business or a business that change name BUT the business owner can't reply to any such post. So the communication is borked and Yelp does't care to fix that. They do mention ""freedom of speech"" which my wife and I do get, but then how come someone can post a review on a close business, but the previous business owner can't reply to it?? If people are able to review but owner can't reply, it means that their back end system has some logic to handle that, but the code for the owner to reply has most likely been disabled ! Why? That's not really how freedom of speech work!<p>Yelp is NOT at all for promoting small business, they are in the business of selling ads and having the most page views. Trying to be a fair and honest business is not at all on their business plan.<p>From what I heard from other small business owner here in the Bay Area, they have experienced mostly the same.<p>Yelp is what I consider a SCAM and as a software engineer I will never consider a job in this unprofessional company. Sooner or later I think the truth will be shown on how Yelp manipulate their system for their own benefits.<p>Finally to conclude this rant, my wife business is still going on even with some negative reviews because we made sure that she was not dependent on Yelp for getting customers.

The bad thing about Scrum is that has also done more to facilitate cargo-cult agile than anything else.<p>Iterations?

If there was one terrible review written a year or two ago by someone with a reviewing history, and then suddenly twenty gushing all caps reviews filled with superlatives and exclamations of personal affection by reviewers with no other review history, all posted within the same week, I'd be upset if yelp <i>didn't</i> filter them out.<p>If some business tells all of their best customers to post a review on Yelp, a site they had never used before, then they actually are straw reviews and worth nothing - and this business owner <i>admits</i> that. Case closed. Filter working perfectly.<p>This is not to say that the one bad review characterizes this man's business in any way. He probably just doesn't have a tech-savvy, hip clientele, and the first yelper he ran into may have been a spoiled curmudgeon. What offsets the damage is that since he isn't drawing from that hip clientele, the review is likely not driving away any significant business.<p>The best response would probably be to put a Yelp sign in some prominent space, which might trigger someone who is familiar with their business to add a few more reviews.

They signed a licensing agreement and a document outlining the various inventions I had coming in to it. After their product was ready to ship, there was a buy out offer, but required exclusive ownership of my IP. The license was non-transferable and required renegotiation.  They didn't like this and asked me to transfer ownership outright to them for free or they would fire me and I would lose all my equity. They had absolutely no case whatsoever, but this didn't stop them from launching legal proceedings against me. These went no where since it was only for the purpose of strongarming and intimidating me. At one point, a vice president of the company was telephoning relatives of mine and threatening them if I didn't cave. I didn't cave, held to my position (which was very reasonable), and they didn't bother to proceed since they knew they had no case, but only after tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees to top notch lawyers to represent me against them. Several months after this they sold to another company (Fortune 500 sort) and lied to them that they owned my IP, not mentioning me at all. That company then patented it, with the VP claiming to have invented it. At the same time I have his signature on a licensing agreement, the exact text describing the invention which appears on their new patent, granted some 10 years after I first implemented it. (It was previously a trade secret that I was selectively licensing.) Of course the next question is why don't I sue them. That's easy. At the end of all this I was broke and in debt and there's no lawyer taking IP cases pro bono. They are tremendously expensive and in the end the company with the deeper pockets nearly always wins.

There's no direct evidence (measuring radiation that could have no other source than the evaporation of the black hole) nor any indirect evidence (black holes losing mass at a rate that cannot be explained unless Hawking radiation is included). So although it seems to fit nicely into the picture, it may not exist at all.<p>A second type of answer is: I don't know and I admit that the physical picture of virtual particles hopping in and out of existence indeed nicely includes an explanation of Hawking radiation. However, I'm reminded of the texts that illustrate how many physical phenomena were considered to be satisfactorily 'explained' within, for instance, the aether model, even though it later turned out the model was fundamentally flawed and all of those physical interpretations were hogwash.<p>A third type of answer is: sometimes things simply aren't what they seem. For instance, we can describe phonons as if they're particles: they are described by the same statistics as 'real' particles are. However, they decidedly aren't particles. They aren't properties of individual particles either: they only exist in macroscopic, well-ordered, amounts of material.

They get angry at Yelp for allowing bad reviews to show up and think they can fix it with reviews written in all-caps with text like ""Bob and Jane ARE THE NICEST, WARMEST, MOST AMAZING PEOPLE I KNOW and the person who wrote the review above DOESN""T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT."" We always advise them not to use these tactics but to instead put a sign up asking their customers to leave reviews on Yelp (since all reviews on the site trend to 4.3, they're probably improving their position with every new review).<p>To recap:<p>- So a business has a small amount of reviews online, one negative from someone who has left more than 400 reviews.<p>- The business asks their loyal customers to leave positive reviews all at the same time.<p>- Yelp sees abnormal traffic and abnormal acceleration of overly-positive reviews from brand new users (OMG. Best Dog Trainer EVER!! A+++++ Would recommend).<p>- Yelp's algorithm flags this activity as abnormal since it looks similar to spam/paid/fake reviews and won't alter their algorithm to accommodate an attempt to game their system.<p>The reality is small businesses do this kind of ""gaming"" all the time and sometimes it's benign, sometimes it's malicious or fake. I once worked with a client who had left dozens of reviews about themselves and complained that Yelp always took them down which ""wasn't fair"". Yelp sees way more attempts at gaming reviews than you'd realize and I imagine they've gotten pretty good at it. Like Google's algorithms, Yelp's algorithms may occasionally flag real reviews. Both have an incentive to improve.<p>The other thing is that if I'm a sales agent at Yelp (responsible for bringing in $8k in revenue this month), I'm going to call on customers who have bad reviews (and thus show up lower in searches) first. This is not because I'm trying to scam anyone. It's because the folks at the bottom are usually the most eager to pay to show up at the top. The guys who already sit in the top 5 spots of an organic search have trouble justifying the expense. If I call on someone who is on the first page of a Yelp search, their first thought isn't going to be ""this guy's trying to scam us"". Likewise, the companies that buy Google ads aren't the ones who show up first in an organic search either (unless they demonstrate that the ROI justifies it. SMBs aren't typically as sophisticated).<p>This isn't extortion, it's not a scam, and it's not wrong. It may appear obtuse from the outside, but nothing would harm Yelp more than for these allegations to be true. It would be downright irresponsible of Yelp to try to do things this way from a shareholders' perspective.<p>TL;DR: SMBs try to game Yelp all the time. Yelp's built algorithms to look for this kind of behavior. This business hit a lot of triggers.",1315163728

That's expensive and very isolating.  This may be great for well-heeled, older couples looking for a minimally-exposed, relaxing jaunt abroad, but it's not what you want.  It seems like every travel  brochure I ever saw in the U.S. featured a photo of a healthy looking, silver-haired couple laughing and enjoying views from afar.<p>Instead, traveling on the cheap, staying in hostels, and getting directly involved in adventures is fun, mind-expanding, and most of all, <i>not</i> lonely.<p>I stayed for a week in a very friendly guest house in rural, northern Thailand for $6 per night.  The hosts would cook meals for around $2, or you could tromp around and play every expat's favorite game:  Who Has The Cheapest Lunch.<p>Like I said, though, travel is a skill.  Just like that crappy code you wrote, your first trip will probably suck.

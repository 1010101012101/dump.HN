I didn&#x27;t fully read it myself, and it ends with this:<p>> In recent decades, farmers and cities have both made strides in reducing their water use. Already, the agricultural industry has embraced techniques like drip irrigation. Farmers are using about the same amount of water as they did in 1960s, but they have doubled the amount of money they get.<p>> The argument for focusing urban conservation may come down to practical concerns. It takes time and investment to make farms more efficient, and the state has already put money into encouraging farmers to buy efficiency upgrades. During drought emergencies, water use can be curtailed faster by simply telling people not to water their lawns.<p>> Besides, the cities are growing. Unless wasteful practices (like grass lawns) can be untaught now, urban users will start to consume more and more of the state’s water.<p>Egg on my face, and apologies to anyone mislead by my being sloppy, that wasn&#x27;t my intention.",1444705157

10378206,comment,10376254,10377813,0,0,mattmcknight,,,"&quot;Estimating work and committing to those estimates&quot;<p>I agree with you that estimation has value, especially at the large scale when you are trying to budget for a multi-year project. (and at that level- the detail you think should be there simply isn&#x27;t) You are also right that at some level it is a social problem, estimates and commitments are two very different things- and you don&#x27;t just commit to an estimate. Estimates are predictions, statements of probability about the unknown future, hopefully based on solid data from past performance and some understanding of the work to be done.  Commitments are promises to make things happen that are only partially within one&#x27;s control. In many cases, an estimate is needed prior to getting the level of information that one would need to make a truly accurate prediction, so we respond with a range of dates to reflect that uncertainty, but this can be too early to make any kind of commitment.<p>If you estimate at the point in time where you are 50% likely to get the job done, and commit to that, half of the time you will be late, even though it is &quot;average time&quot; it would take to do that work. You can&#x27;t take the easy way out and commit at 100% likely time, because you could be sick in the hospital tomorrow (and with a big enough project, someone eventually is). If you commit to an 90% confidence estimate, you get stuck with Parkinson&#x27;s law type problems. Not to mention that those predictions with percentages are hard to base on real data...but if you make enough of them, you can actually get feedback on your accuracy.<p>The problem is that most audiences for estimates aren&#x27;t able to deal with the uncertainty, and many givers of estimates are easily pushed into overcommitting.   This is why some of the ideas popularized by the Agile movement seem to work- if you fix the time increment, it is much easier to flex on the scope, especially when it is not possible for it to be well-defined in advance.  For example, there are many cases where an high confidence estimate can&#x27;t be made- as is often the case in more research oriented projects, where the path to a working solution, or whether one will even be found, is unknown, and it is part of the job of the project to discover that.  You are stuck with estimating how long it will take you to try approaches x, y, and z.<p>McConnell&#x27;s classic &quot;Software Estimation&quot; probably says it better. See ch 1 of McConnell&#x27;s book here- page one is on the commitment/target/estimation problem: <a href=""http://www.stevemcconnell.com/estimation-01.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stevemcconnell.com/estimation-01.pdf</a>",1444703139

  @    (bind v @(get-string (open-command `cd @path && git remote -v`)))
  @    (next :string `@v`)
  @      (skip)
  vps@a(fetch)
  @      (bind url @(trim-str a))
  @  (end)
</code></pre>
probably just wants to be something like perhaps this:<p><pre><code>  @(next `!cd @path && git remote -v`)
  vps@\t@url (fetch)
</code></pre>
Match directly into the output of the git command with @(next ...), and extract the url directly: it is delimited by tab from the remote name (which we can use literally or represent using @\t) and by a space from the (fetch) or (push) keyword. Thus we can eliminate the trim-str extra step and variable.<p>Also if v holds a string, `@v` simplifies to v!<p>Another thing is that if we are just marching through data to produce output, and don&#x27;t actually need to collect anything to analyze, we can convert this structure:<p><pre><code>  @(collect)
  ...match...
  @(end)
  @(output)
  @  (repeat)
  ...spew...
  @  (end)
  @(end)
</code></pre>
into:<p><pre><code>  @(repeat)
  ...match...
  @  (output)
  ...spew...
  @  (end)
  @(end)
</code></pre>
It&#x27;s not just shorter, but efficient too if the data is large (it doesn&#x27;t hang on to collected data as it marches through it).<p>Cheers ...",1444703105

I just meant for this specific idea, since spending the money is at the Department&#x27;s discretion, and they have shown a desire to get rid of Coward, then it seems likely accepting this donation would be just asking for trouble some time in the future when their conflicting motivations finally catch up to them.<p>And it&#x27;s not so much that the expendables are &quot;fungible&quot;. By definition, they are not, and it&#x27;s technically illegal to perform this sort of back-dating. It&#x27;s just not easily verifiable that such a thing has happened.<p>If the department decided to do a one-off like &quot;t-shirts for the programming team&quot; and put it into the budget, it&#x27;s highly likely there isn&#x27;t already a restricted fund of any type that would cover such a thing. If they got the budget approval for it, it&#x27;d almost certainly come out of the unrestricted fund. But then you come along, not knowing that the department has planned on doing this, remembering fondly your days on the programming team, thinking &quot;it would have been really nice if we had matching t-shirts for when we traveled to competitions&quot;, and you come up with the idea to give an expandable gift, but you end up giving it after the t-shirts have already been bought.<p>This sort of serendipity is common enough, for a variety of different things. The correct thing to do would be to send the money back to you, because the money is already spent, they can&#x27;t unspend the unrestricted money, but they aren&#x27;t likely to agree to do a second t-shirt run. But it&#x27;s highly unlikely you&#x27;d learn otherwise, or even care if you did, so they whitewash over the issue because there is almost zero chance you&#x27;re going to find out that there was a budget amendment saying the t-shirts weren&#x27;t purchased until after your gift, even if the students have had them for weeks already.<p>And I personally know of plenty of places that will do just that, not tell the little white lie and actually return the gift. They have a standard of ethics they adhere to and rightly view it as a slippery slope. It&#x27;s a short hop from this sort of thing to, say, back-dating donations given after the first of the year to say they were given before the first of the year so donors can claim them on their taxes, putting you into the realm of full-blown tax fraud.<p>But yes, unrestricted funds are, by definition, completely fungible. Often, you&#x27;ll be donating in response to a &quot;solicitation&quot; tied to a specific &quot;campaign&quot;, e.g. a mailing as part of a specific project to generate a certain amount of money. They&#x27;d likely be asking you to donate towards &quot;the so-and-so endowment for the arts&quot;, or some other named fund. This is just a form of salesmanship, structuring things in this way, supposedly people are more willing to donate money when it&#x27;s to a specific, named cause [0]. If you really care about your organization, you should write in a note that you wish to donate to the unrestricted fund, or to use the funds &quot;as deemed fit by the university/hospital/etc&quot;.<p>[0] I somewhat doubt anyone has actually done a study, and even if they did, I severely doubt it was conducted properly to show significant results.

It&#x27;s either friendly sympathy or friendly lust, and I would assume if I was super handsome, there would be more friendliness, not less. The closest to getting uncomfortable is when someone is into me whom I find very uninteresting; that&#x27;s just &quot;awkward&quot;, and so extremely tame compared to having to wonder whether she is just a bit creepy or maybe capable of rape. When women invite me to somewhere or strike up a conversation, I can just be relaxed without having to keep one eye on the exit. I consider that normal but it&#x27;s, sorry for saying it, a privilege. It really is.<p>My point is, it&#x27;s not the &quot;being considered attractive&quot; by itself that offends and hurts people.

I am only slightly familiar, but my understanding is that kaiseki ryori is not about &quot;tasty&quot; but a form of philosophical statement by the chef (for example, seasonal touches referring to the impermanence of life), and also a means of linking with nature. For example, the rough, asymmetrical, and &quot;used-looking&quot; look of the tableware, in contrast to say the impeccable and ornate perfection of the Chinese equivalent, references wabi-sabi and is meant to both complement the seasonal and natural feel of the ingredients, and make you think about the bittersweet nature of ephemeral life. There might even be cultural references. In many cases you&#x27;re supposed to get out still feeling slightly hungry. Each dish evokes a different feeling and the succession of feelings and the way in which they are executed are what a meal like Kikunoi is about. (dear Japanese readers please correct me)<p>It&#x27;s like &quot;no&quot; theatre (not kabuki!): a highly formalized, stylized art form where the audience is expected to be familiar with everything already and is appreciating only the &quot;how&quot; not the &quot;what&quot; of the play. A no performance uses archaic language modern Japanese audiences don&#x27;t even understand, but all the attendees know the words already. It would feel tremendously boring to an outsider (guilty!), with not much visually happening, whilst your Japanese host gets excited about the masterly way in which bending the head a couple of degrees down has utterly changed the implied feeling of the actor.<p>When I first travelled to Japan, I was frustrated by the lack of intensity present in, well, everything, from architecture to food (except fast food) and even fashion. My relatively frequent trips to Japan improved a lot after I took the time to read books to try and understand the local mindset, at least of Kamakura to Edo period Japan (when the warriors took over from the overly sophisticated aristocracy that ran the country from Kyoto in the Heian period). It is this refinement within the constraints of simplicity (with the tea ceremony the most extreme example) that makes Japanese arts so sophisticated. We sort of have it in the West too; Mozart is not impressive aurally in the way that, say, Rachmaninov or Liszt might be, but playing Mozart well (or something like Liszt&#x27;s Pilgrimage Years) requires a lifetime of study and is appreciated for its subtlety and control and life experience more than the sheer block of sound and expressed ideas in the content.",1444701948

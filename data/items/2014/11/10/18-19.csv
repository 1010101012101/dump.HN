And I enjoyed it when I was freelancing too. The world&#x27;s a lot bigger than the little bit of it you&#x27;re seeing now. Get out there and see some of it.<p>Ah, the patronizing tone of someone without a clue. Some of us enjoy working on large, important things that need standards.

Maybe being talented is like entering the billionaire raffle. Why is paying everyone $100k more fair than paying everyone $50k and giving some the chance at being billionaires?<p>It&#x27;s not more fair, but it&#x27;s more efficient. The boost in happiness that you get from having a billion dollars rather than $50k is not 19999x bigger than the boost you get from having $100k rather than having $50k.

What about the others that returned 0x?<p>They&#x27;re either complete write-offs, or a small percentage of the unused capital is returned to the VC fund. I&#x27;m pretty sure the author didn&#x27;t mean to imply that the return on investment for the entire VC fund was 95x. Any VC fund has a bunch of writeoffs and a bunch of homeruns. The homeruns have to compensate for the writeoffs. Looking at the average return for successful exits is a reasonable metric because if the successful exits are only 5x then clearly the fund is a hopeless position. And if there are a number of great exits it doesn&#x27;t matter much if the fund has many duds or only a couple. The average-return-on-exit metric isn&#x27;t great either, because the largest exits matter most and the average doesn&#x27;t properly reflect that.",1415645812

8585472,comment,8584189,8584189,0,0,taylodl,,,"I worked on two Smalltalk projects in the early 90&#x27;s at two different companies. Both efforts were abandoned for C++. Some of the issues we encountered at the time:<p>* Numerical computation was too slow. Numbers used to be objects and all numerical computations followed object messaging. Ouch! This was eventually remediated but not before we&#x27;d dropped Smalltalk.<p>* Garbage collection was S-L-O-W. Your workstation would randomly freeze 30-60 seconds. It was that bad.<p>* The built-in windowing environment was an albatross in the early days of Windows and OS/2. Customers wanted a native look-and-feel not the weird (to them) Smalltalk window manager.<p>* Not everyone had yet bought into object-oriented programming, much less making everything an object. This was really bizarre at the time - even code was an object. Makes sense now, but few people were thinking that way then.<p>* It was strange. C++ seemed safer since everybody at the time knew and was comfortable with C programming. Little did we know the pitfalls awaiting us when using C++! :)<p>In the end I think the Smalltalk experience left such a bad taste in everyone&#x27;s mouth that when these issues were resolved  no one was interested in going back and giving Smalltalk a second look. Nowadays Smalltalk lives on in Objective-C. In fact one the shops I was in abandoned Smalltalk for Objective-C, which is one of the few instances I know of people using Objective-C outside of the Apple ecosystem.",1415645804

Everything must be absolute. It&#x27;s idiotic. In complex systems, it&#x27;s actually pretty rare for the optimum point to lie at the extreme end of any variable range. Fitness peaks are almost always found at some intersection point that represents a best compromise between multiple interacting tradeoffs.<p>History seems to indicate that a free market economy with some amount of wealth redistribution represents an optimum, or fitness peak. Experiments in extreme free markets seem to devolve into pathologically ridiculous wealth concentration, while experiments in pure egalitarian socialism seem to succumb to free rider parasitism problems and corruption. The terminal state of pure capitalism seems to be corporate/financial feudalism, while the terminal state of pure socialism seems to be the mafia state (e.g. Putinistan or the Chinese kleptocracy). Neither extreme seems either desirable or stable, and both seem to devolve rapidly into some form of totalitarianism.<p>I&#x27;d personally advocate a simple, completely impartial system like a universal basic income or a negative income tax along with some benefits like a basic level of universal health coverage and public education. Taxation should be progressive because it&#x27;s precisely at the extreme ends of the income curve that the relationship between value creation and renumeration seems to break down and become most pathological, but that progressiveness should probably be rather skewed toward the high end. The taxation curve should probably look like a hockey stick.",1415645430

I do not think they should have been used in subsequent wars.<p>First, the war against Japan and Germany was about as close to an unambiguous fight against evil as you can find in the real world. The post, while trying to paint them as unrealistic caricatures, still manages to understate it. Ultimately, the war was justifiable and winning it was the best outcome for everybody.<p>If we accept that the war had to be won, then winning it in the most efficient way possible, in terms of time and lives, is best. I think the atomic bombings accomplished that. It&#x27;s debatable and can probably never be known for sure, but it seems likely that Japan would have held out much longer without them. Even with them, there was a nearly successful palace coup aimed at preventing the surrender. Even ignoring the Allied lives that would be lost in an invasion, many more Japanese would have died by the time the war was over.<p>That establishes the (fairly standard) reasoning for using the atomic bombs on Japan. How about afterwards?<p>None of the subsequent hot wars were anywhere close to being as black and white. The post mentions Vietnam as an example where the lack of atomic weapons made for a glaring plot hole. But really, are you going to use atomic weapons on a country that poses no threat to you whatsoever, in a conflict which is basically a war of independence where you&#x27;re fighting on the side of the colonial oppressors? I&#x27;m not going to argue that Communism was a good thing for Vietnam or that victory by North Vietnam was a good outcome, but it doesn&#x27;t look like our side was particularly in the right. Would lives have been saved by nuking Hanoi? Would evil have been defeated? I don&#x27;t think so.<p>And even ignoring all that, the practical realities of the world order prevented it. Maybe you could win Vietnam by nuking Hanoi (although I&#x27;m not sure how the one follows from the other exactly) but it&#x27;s hard to see a scenario where that doesn&#x27;t quickly turn into an all-out nuclear war between the superpowers, where nobody wins and everybody loses big. The only time it was remotely feasible was for a few years after 1945 until the Russians had enough nuclear capability to make it an unwise choice, roughly 1955 or so. What does that leave us with, using nukes in Korea like MacArthur wanted to? I don&#x27;t know if that wins the war either. (Mao was famously welcoming of nuclear war, believing that China&#x27;s massive population meant they would weather it and win it.) And even if it did, would it be worth it? I don&#x27;t see the balance of lives working out in favor of dropping a hydrogen bomb on Beijing the way it did with Japan.<p>One more thing to consider: if WWII had been won without nuclear weapons (either because the choice was made not to use them, or the project took a little longer than it did in reality) then my guess is that we wouldn&#x27;t have seen the subsequent restraint in using them afterwards. Rather than the first (and so far only) use in war being two small bombs, it might have been an exchange of hundreds, with the participants realizing what a terrible idea that is only too late. This has no bearing on justifying the decision in 1945 (how could they be expected to know all these future consequences?) but it&#x27;s interesting to consider that the timing of the development and use of nuclear weapons may have been extremely lucky.",1415645424

It&#x27;s that VCs are, to a large degree, responsible. They don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to play get-big-or-die. There will be a nonzero failure rate no matter what, but it doesn&#x27;t need to be this high. To a large degree, it&#x27;s the VCs&#x27; fault for pushing their companies to take unreasonable risk. Often, worse yet, that risk is often counter-innovative... it&#x27;s not creative risk but &quot;hire 200 people next year and do Pearson&#x27;s grunt work in large amounts&quot; risk.<p>At the low end of the risk spectrum, you have small consultancies with minimal overhead and businesses with secured assets that you can take bank loans for. At the high-risk, high-growth end, you have companies that will either be 100 times their current size, or dead, inside of 3 years.<p>The mid-risk, mid-growth businesses, targeting 20-60% annual growth, tend to be too risky for bank loans but not interesting to VCs. Those will be 5-10x (at 10 years) most often with an occasional 200x, but rarely a 10,000x.<p>The thing is, the goal of the game shouldn&#x27;t be to maximize your chances of getting (extremely rare, and difficult to get in to) 10,000x&#x27;s. It should be to make money. If you can do that with a string of 5-10x results and a lower (say, 30%) failure rate, instead of swinging for 10,000x and having a 90% failure rate, then maybe you should. Not only are those 10,000x&#x27;s rare no matter what you do, but unless you&#x27;re extremely well-connected you&#x27;re not going to be able to put more than a small amount of money into them.<p>Why is the Valley like this? Ultimately, it&#x27;s not about making money. It&#x27;s about the VCs&#x27; careers. You get a lot of credit, as an individual, for having &quot;been in on&quot; Facebook or Twitter. It&#x27;s difficult to predict the successes in advance, which is why you get the creepy co-funding culture, which doesn&#x27;t make money for anyone (in fact, they make less money because of it, because they fund lower-quality stuff) but spreads around the career credit of being an early investor in something that hits big.",1415645382

For example, in the MyKlass case.<p><pre><code>    v.push_back(MyKlass(2, 3.14f));\n</code></pre>\nWhat&#x27;s being invoked: a move constructor or copy constructor? How would you verify? You could maybe add a move or copy constructor with some logging, but defining either of those can change which one gets invoked! So I guess you have to hunt through the assembly.<p>Here&#x27;s another case that terrifies me. Testing with clang 3.5:<p><pre><code>    return a; // invokes a&#x27;s move constructor\n    return true ? a : a; // invokes a&#x27;s copy constructor\n    if (true) return a; else return a; // elides constructors using RVO\n</code></pre>\nSo even when you do get it right, seemingly irrelevant changes can silently break it.

First version of Chrome for the desktop supported extensions, because it was competing with a popular Firefox, and now on Android they don&#x27;t give a shit about enabling users to customize the behavior of their browser, which pisses me off.<p>So I switched to Firefox on my Android because it allows me to use these plugins ... AdBlock Plus, HTTPS Everywhere + LastPass. Plus it has a handy Reader Mode, that&#x27;s like  Readability built into my Firefox. And I find the UI nicer on my 7-inch tablet. This naturally led to a decision to switch to Firefox on the desktop too, because Sync.<p>2. In Firefox on my desktop I like having Tab Groups + the Awesome Bar (which does a good job of doing full text searches in my history, much better than what other browsers are capable of) + a really cool tweak to the Australis theme called &quot;The Fox, Only Better&quot; which is awesome and will make it much harder for me to switch browsers again.<p>I also love it when Mozilla develops something, then everybody benefits, like Asm.js or PDF.js. Try using Chromium instead of Chrome, it&#x27;s not the same experience.<p>3. I&#x27;ve been all hooked into Google&#x27;s stuff, I even pay for a Google Apps account and everything, but I noticed that Google hasn&#x27;t been aligned with my interests.<p>For example they killed Google Reader to promote Google+, they showed no interest in fixing Gmail&#x27;s broken IMAP support, they showed no interest in fixing Google Calendar&#x27;s broken CalDAV support, they discontinued the Exchange support from Gmail, they discontinued the XMPP support from Google Hangouts, they announced no interest in providing alternatives that I know of, certain features in their online products only work in Chrome. It seems to me that Google is only interested in standards as long as they are the underdog.<p>I also moved to Dropbox as my cloud storage, because Google Drive still does not have a Linux client. I mean, Google out of all companies should think that Linux support also means headless servers (like home servers or other appliances), so providing Linux support should be obvious. But no, 2 years later, the OS X client is still shitty and still no Linux support. I have to trust my data to a third-party if I want that, or suffer one of the shitty open-source alternatives and risk my data.<p>So there you have it - Firefox is a great browser and it also tries to make me happy.

8585365,comment,8583572,8585334,0,0,api,,,"This creates a problem though:<p>If you are a highly intelligent and motivated person, you have many choices about what to do. This suggests that doing the kind of basic R&D work that might lead to the invention of the WWW is a sucker&#x27;s game. You shouldn&#x27;t invent wheels. Instead you should invent Ferrari&#x27;s using other peoples&#x27; wheels.<p>This over time will lead to brain drain from the realms of basic research and invention. I&#x27;d posit this as a possible explanation for the decline of fundamental innovation since roughly 1970, which coincidentally is the era when the groundwork for this shift in wealth distribution really got laid with the emergence of the &quot;new left&quot; and the &quot;new right.&quot; (What I call the reactionary left and the reactionary right -- note that in both cases the naturalistic fallacy is a cornerstone of these belief systems.)<p>I&#x27;d count myself among the drained. I decided not to do a Ph.D partly because I didn&#x27;t want to take a vow of poverty to do work to make other people rich.<p>Free markets reward things exponentially as they near the point of consumption. The person who puts the icing on the cake is rewarded exponentially more than the person who baked it, who in turn is rewarded exponentially more than the person who made the flour, and so on. The folks rewarded exponentially most of all are the financiers who simply move money around to fund these activities.<p>This seems unfair in virtually every case, but it&#x27;s incredibly unfair in the realm of ideas, invention, science, and technology. In ordinary manual labor the difficulty of each step tends to be similar, while in intellectual realms the fundamental steps of invention and discovery are often exponentially <i>harder</i> than the ones closer to the end of the line. So for intellectual work, the relationship between difficulty and importance and compensation is <i>really</i> pathologically skewed.",1415644840

Never top-end, rarely popular: TRS-80, Coleco Adam, etc. though we really never knew much about computing, I think it was my father&#x27;s endless fascination with them that made them ever present. I frequently visited my friends who all had C-64s, Mac Classics and Amigas and we&#x27;d spend hours tooling around on them.<p>Then somewhere along the way, my parents splurged and bought a 386sx with 2MB of RAM (so I could run Windows) and I was hooked. I remember buying my first soundcard (a SoundBlaster) so I could play .mod files, installing it was a harrowing experience, nobody in my family had ever seen the guts of a computer that wasn&#x27;t broken (and rendered into pieces out of curiosity). I started getting modems, external at first until I exceeded the speed of the UART and installed my second expansion card and I think it was around that point that I was <i>hooked</i>. I kind of felt like I was hot rodding.<p>My first real job was at a mom and pop computer repair shop where I learned to resurrect by then ancient machines and bring to life top of the line Pentiums. Along the way I bought and built several of my own machines out of spare parts lying around the shop, the pinnacle was a 486dx2-66 with 8MB of RAM, a decent machine at the time...built for around $50.<p>My friends, knowing I had an inside line and the knowhow started buying parts, memory, whatever through me. It felt like the ascendancy of power.<p>I won a Pentium Pro motherboard at a conference drawing and spent a couple month&#x27;s wages completing the rest of the system, it lasted me for years.<p>I remember when a local computer store ran a promotion, &quot;Computer for $1000!&quot; and the line was out the door and around the block. It made the Windows 95 release madness look tame. People were thirsty for affordable, accessible, usable computing. Most people in that line were buying their first computer and had no idea what they were going to do with it. The store solved that by giving out disks for a local free ISP they could dial in and suddenly thousands of people in my area were connected to millions of other people.<p>I&#x27;m continuously in awe of how powerful an affordable computing has become. A $200 device that also happens to be a phone is an order of magnitude better computer than the one those people were standing in line hours for. It&#x27;s also connected to the same Internet, but the things we can do on that internet today are orders of magnitude bigger.<p>I do worry about today&#x27;s kids in a sense, they&#x27;ll never know the joy of learning to build a boot disk from scratch so they can play their favorite game, the OSs are simply too complicated for that kind of fooling around. The entire OS, including a BASIC of my 386sx fit on a couple floppies, came with a few games and was only a few dozen files.<p>In some ways the Pi brings lots of that back, it&#x27;s bareboned enough that you <i>have</i> to figure it out to get it to work.

Aside from the special election in the case of NOTA getting a plurality, it requires no change to the existing voting system except for the addition of a NOTA option for each position being voted on in an election.<p>Second, it is very easy to understand.  IRV, Approval, other schemes are not that difficult to pick up once you&#x27;ve seen an example, but just about everyone already has experience with None Of The Above selections, and often on ballot-like forms, no less.<p>Third, it encourages [the segment of non-voters who abstain from voting due to feeling that there is a lack of viable candidates] to make their positions known, resulting in a better understanding of the wishes of the public.<p>Fourth, due to the other reasons listed above, it is very hard to argue against.  What good reasons are there to NOT have this?  The only place I can see a strong argument taking hold against the adoption of this measure is that a special election is required if NOTA wins, and that&#x27;s a non-trivial change to the system.<p>In order to see this get widely implemented, I would explore the idea of starting out with NOTA being non-binding.  I do not know if this is a good idea.  If it starts out &quot;toothless&quot; (in the sense that whichever candidate gets the most votes still gets in even if the candidate is outranked by NOTA), will the realization of the public that the plurality does not approve of any candidate provide enough pressure to update it to something more powerful once it&#x27;s established?  Does the risk of that not being the case outweigh the benefits we get from seeing just how little approval there is for the candidates selected for us before the voting starts?<p>We know that public pressure is one of the best tools that citizens have to rein in their governments.  I believe that starting with a narrow wedge--implementing a non-binding NOTA option at state levels--makes it more likely to be adopted in a larger number of states than otherwise.  Seeing in hard, official numbers how disappointed the public is with the choices they are continually offered should be enough to enable further action.  Of course if there is a strong enough public will for it, the binding law is better to have from the start.  It just seems to me that there won&#x27;t be enough support for something like this until there&#x27;s more widespread awareness of how abysmal the current situation is.",1415644560

As a premise, poor people and young people spend aggressively, wealthy households invest and don’t spend proportionally to their means, and a significant number of older Americans have no retirement savings to speak of, and therefore cannot spend proportional to offset their declining economic contribution. Essentially, this is a perfect recipe to grind an economy to a halt: Wealthy people don’t spend, elderly workers don’t spend, poor people and young people love to spend but can’t without reasonable access to funding.<p>Hi, Federal Reserve, is it comfy in between that rock and hard place?

Throwing a bunch of keywords tailored to a specific job ad is completely pointless, from my perspective.  I have successfully learned the work of several different skilled professionals and reduced large portions of that work to computer programs.<p>What you ask, and is mirrored at hundreds of other companies, is roughly analogous to someone in the construction trade building residential homes, commercial office space, retail buildings, and municipal buildings over the course of their career, and then having someone suggest that they ought to list &quot;hammer&quot; and &quot;screwdriver&quot; on their resume.  Never mind if the person actually uses pneumatic nail guns and power drills for the nails and screws, the magic keywords are &quot;hammer&quot; and &quot;screwdriver&quot;.  Never mind if the person is actually smart enough to be a general contractor and halfway to being a civil engineer.  If that resume doesn&#x27;t say &quot;hammer&quot; on it, he doesn&#x27;t get called back.<p>What you are asking is irrelevant, gratuitous, and counterproductive--thus, hoops to jump through.  My skills are <i>not</i> Java and C#.  My skill is making other skilled workers more productive, by any means necessary--though usually with the help of a computer.  Part of that is recognizing that when thousands of people are each wasting their time on unnecessary steps every time they perform a task that may be repeated several times every day, the situation may be improved dramatically by eliminating that waste.<p>There are several potential solutions.  One is to tell you, and everyone else in a similar position, that your expectations are ignorant and counterproductive, and show a cavalier lack of respect toward potential hires.  You are asking that they invest five minutes of time specifically into your company, rather than into their own general job search, just so that you will not arbitrarily toss their application into the trash.  This is <i>in addition to</i> the 20-60 minutes the typical HR gatekeeper <i>already</i> requires to re-type every single datum from that resume into a non-portable custom form in their candidate tracking system.<p>If I&#x27;m going to spend <i>even more</i> time on your company, I&#x27;d like the potential return to be worth the effort.  Until you actually talk to me, I won&#x27;t know that.  And as long as we&#x27;re talking, we can just skip the resume and spend that extra five minutes on the way to &quot;yes&quot;, instead of just evading &quot;no&quot;.",1415644209

We do! It&#x27;s a lie that ads give people content and services for free (explained below). If Mozilla truly wants to fight for users, it needs to end its reliance on advertising revenue, and help invent honest ways for content and service creators to get paid by end users. We are a creative industry. We can find ways to do this while also keeping access open to the fraction of the population that can&#x27;t afford to pay (which per below would only be people who don&#x27;t buy advertised products).<p>I know this truth is hard to swallow for an industry that has grown so dependent on ads. As Upton Sinclair said, <i>&quot;It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.&quot;</i>  But if we are to do the right thing, we have to really think about the truth:<p>1. The advertisers who pay web providers get their money from us, added to the prices of other things we consume. There is no free lunch.<p>2. The overhead cost of advertising is huge and we pay for that too.<p>3. We pay the opportunity cost of a product that cannot put users first because ad-supported web providers live or die by giving advertisers what they want (and what we want indirectly and secondarily). This includes both the cost of lost privacy as well as business, editorial and design decisions that optimize for advertising revenue. As has been said, they are using us as products more than treating us as their paying customers. Let me restate to be extra clear: WE are the paying customer, but we don&#x27;t look like that to their finance department.<p>4. We pay for all the collateral damage of advertising, such as the tremendous amount of link-bait and other garbage that advertising perversely incentivizes.<p>5. We pay the social costs. Whether or not you agree with the social costs laid out in the above article, I&#x27;m sure most can agree democracy and the free market assume people make voting and purchasing decisions based on facts and reason. Advertising undermines democracy[1] and the free market[2]. Advertising is predominantly about manipulation and deceit. I believe the social costs are the most expensive.<p>Added together, we end users are paying a lot more for &quot;free&quot; product than if we could just straight up pay for it. And even we non-users are paying the social costs and collateral damage.<p>Ads are simply a sneaky and dishonest way to get at end users&#x27; money without them realizing it.<p>-<p>[This is a condensed version of a more detailed case with reference links that I made here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7485773"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7485773</a>]<p>[1] You don&#x27;t need me to explain.

If the heads on an engine were steel and much thicker you could do the same job with a couple of bolts instead of a dozen.<p>If an auto manufacturer was enterprising they could probably move some of the oil passages away from the coolant and combustion (which by their nature need to be close to one another) and they could make cavities for o-rings and seal the oil from the coolant a lot more effectively.  But the failure rate for head gaskets is fairly low already and that would be adding a fair amount of cost and fiddly-ness to a not-that-big problem.  When I say &quot;fairly low&quot; what I mean is that it might comprise 10% of engine failures but engine failures are already pretty rare, so 10% of 1% isn&#x27;t all that big of a deal.  Those are made-up numbers, btw, so don&#x27;t crucify me if they&#x27;re wrong.",1415643793

They must not go in search of it<p>The better solution is there should never be a need to search for it. AMD already knows their Mesa driver is all around a better user experience than Catalyst, and are making steps to depreciate work done on the Catalyst side by using a free kernel driver. Hopefully soon they will depreciate it entirely and dedicate all their Linux developers to making Gallium great.<p>Because Gallium is not just about playing games anymore. It is the basis for every other free software graphics driver besides Intels. It has the potential to revolutionize not just the Linux ecosystem but all operating systems by providing a well architected way to support dozens of GPUs with one system API and one driver model. It has a state tracker model that lets you run OpenGL, DirectX, OpenMAX, EGL, GLES, etc all on top of one driver implementation.<p>And Nvidia should get in on that, but those who hold the reins over there (business suits) are incompetent twat assholes who don&#x27;t want to play ball with free software and damn all of us for it, and cripple the industry and any momentum they have because nonsense like &quot;SteamOS only works on Nvidia cards&quot;.<p>OpenGL 4.2 will land soon™.

8585090,comment,8582641,8582641,0,0,themagician,,,"I used to have money. When I got divorced I decided I would let my wife have it all. It was mostly hers to begin with, so it wasn&#x27;t some great act of generosity. She walked away with somewhere around $2MM in liquidity. I walked away with about $10,000.<p>It&#x27;s really made very little difference. Money makes some things easier, but I wouldn&#x27;t associate that with happy. They are two separate things. There was a time when I thought money would make me happy, and I think there was a time where maybe it did, but there was a realization that my &quot;happiness&quot; wasn&#x27;t my own. I don&#x27;t even know if that makes sense to anyone but me, but that&#x27;s the only way I can articulate it. I was happy because I thought I should be happy with all the stuff and &quot;freedom&quot;, but at the end of the day I didn&#x27;t really care about those things.<p>Now I&#x27;m in this place, this awkward state, where money can&#x27;t buy any of the things I want. It&#x27;s a confusing place to be because the world doesn&#x27;t really operate that way. I wish money made me happy. That would make everything much easier.",1415642533

1370305,comment,1368051,1368051,0,0,Jun8,,,"Some interesting facts about the Chinese writing system:<p>* The consequences of not having an alphabetic script are large. There can be no crossword puzzles, no games like Scrabble, no anagrams, and no Morse code! To get around the last problem, The Chinese have devised a system where each word was assigned a number, e.g. ""Person"" was 0086 [<i></i>The Mother Tongue<i>]<p></i> Massive statistical tests in the past two decades have repeatedly demonstrated that 1,000 characters cover approximately 90% of symbols in typical texts, 2400 cover 99%, 3,800 cover 99.9%. Based on the study of other logographic systems (Mayan writing, Egyptian hieroglyphs), it seems that there's an upper limit on the number of unique forms that can be tolerated in a script. For most people, this value seems to be in the range 2000-2500.<p>* A Chinese character is generally confused with a word, the assumption being that Sinitic language are exclusively monosyllabic. This is not true. In modern Mandarin the average length of a word is almost exactly two syllables.<p>* The Chinese writing system is very well suited to writing Classical Chinese but ill-equipped to record the vernaculars (local dialects/languages) of which there are many in China. Consequently, to write Cantonese, Taiwanese, and Shanghainese, it is necessary to invent characters or resort to romanization.<p>The source is <i>The World's Writing Systems</i> by Oxford University Press. I recommend this book to everyone who's interested in these matters.<p>[Edit] In case you're wondering, Chinese has palindromes, but not the letter-based ones like we're used to. Hofstadter in <i>Le Ton beau de Marot</i> relates an anecdote with a Chinese professor. Prof. Wu first shows them a famous Chinese palindrome: Ye luo tian luo ye (At leaves-fall season, fall the leaves). In turn, H shows him the quintessential Panama palindrome, but Prof. Wu has difficulty understanding it because he was reading it word by word (p. 143)",1274536796

When you go on vacation, the first thing you do is drop into a mobile phone shop and pick up a new SIM for whatever country you happen to be in this week.<p>When I moved back to England from Spain, I walked into a store, paid 5 pounds, and received a SIM with 5 pounds credit on it.  The whole operation took upwards of a minute and a half.<p>It's just so simple, straightforward, and cheap this way.  It's amazing that people in the US tolerate it any other way.

1370296,comment,1368024,1369088,0,0,Terretta,,,"I read all books in order as well.<p>I prefer e-readers (Sony Reader, Kindle DX, iPad) because I read at the speed of about one airport novel per hour, meaning I need five books for a cross country flight.  It's easier to carry these electronically, and I keep a backlog of 50 - 70 books available to read.<p>For computer books, such as the jQuery Cookbook I purchased yesterday from O'Reilly in this sale, I will also read each one from cover to cover.  With that reading I form a visual spatial memory of where in the book I can find any information I need.<p>My memory is not eidetic.  I can't read the actual words, and I don't remember every page number.  But I do know about how deep in the book, left or right page, and where on the page to look, so I can usually find a needed reference within a half dozen page turns.<p>With e-readers, this is fuzzier.  The ""where in the book"" depends on the progress bar, and there's no left or right to halve the search, so takes at least 10 - 20 page turns instead.  These page turns are SLOOOOOW.<p>On the iPad, page turns are many times faster.  So, finding reference material in a thick reference book that I cognitively mapped on the iPad is commensurately faster.",1274536597

However, I have to agree with the point that the article places the church in a bad daylight for the first item. Galileo wasn't refused because what he said was against scripture (was it even?). The main argument from the church was that his theory was methodologically flawed.<p>First there was no good reason to assume that telescopes provided a good image of distant bodies, so observations made using them had no credibility and could thus not be counted as 'evidence' as the article states. Secondly, if the earth moved and we with it, why did an object that was dropped from a tower, land at the bottom of that tower and not a good distant away from it? Assuming that the earth and the tower moved with it, but not the object since it was touching the earth nor the tower.<p>Galileo had a lot of explaining to do: the observations he made simply could not be placed in the prevalent scientific model. The easy way out is was to refute the evidence because it did not fit, the long way out was to rebuild the model.",1274534765

So they let Apple do their thing and then after the media frenzy had died down a bit, made their big announcement. Of course Google I/O was already planned so that made the perfect forum to make their announcement.<p>Now to add insult to injury, the week after they talk about all the new features, they actually release them.

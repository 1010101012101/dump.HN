13086,comment,12932,13061,0,0,bootload,,,"'<i>... I'm not sure I understand what you mean about privacy details. We actually do let you delete your documents ...'</i><p>Hi Phil. <p>I just tried a simple set of tasks of an old file that I had (open office) and worked on it as I would each week. I remember reading your article a while ago on how you started, so I'm not surprised its so polished. Re-reading the original parent article I missed the collaborative blogging bit.<p>So I took some time and tried some more stuff and it works fine. I wouldn't go overboard on the 'underwhelming bits' I mentioned (spelling - because real-time could hit you on the server & you could optomise. eg: Firefox 2 with spelling included on the textboxes). So what I found, was pretty factual for a single user working on a document. <p><i>'... I'm not sure I understand what you mean about privacy details ...'</i><p>The privacy deletion bit,  I mentioned happened when I did a bit of a poke around in your licensing files [0]. It states you keep a copy but remove the viewing capability, but not remove the file.  This could be a problem for users (it would for me) but I don't know.<p><i>'... but we're making a tool that's useful any time you're working on something with other people ...'</i><p>I didn't get to do this bit. I assume you differentiate the users additions to documents?  Can 2 users work at the same time?<p><i>'... If there are other privacy features you want, we'd love to hear about it (get us at honchos@writewith.com) ...'</i><p>I'll add it to the todo list I have, can't promise ... gotta work on my product as well :)   One thing I will add is, check flickr for the way they license their text/images (creative content).<p>Regs PR<p>Reference<p>[0] writewith, legal privacy, 'Your Preferences: ...

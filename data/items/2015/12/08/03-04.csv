Security is hard enough without adding in the possibility of 3rd parties hearing the protoocol - or worse.<p>> directional<p>A common misunderstanding of radio is the belief that it can be contained in an area. Unless you&#x27;re building a proper Faraday cage (which is <i>hard</i>), the ability to hear a transmmission often depends on the receiving antenna.<p>For convenience without involving radio, one simply has to get creative. Something like the (defunct) Java Ring[1] would allow most of the ease-of-use of RFID (possibly with a simple proximity sensor for auto-logout, if needed).<p>[1] <a href=""http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/home/digital-jewelry3.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/home/digital-je...</a><p>edit: fixed typo",1449547195

10694697,comment,10688606,10688606,0,0,haberman,,,"This analysis misses one major part of the equation: configuring the build.  Almost every non-trivial piece of software can be built in multiple configurations.  Debug vs. Release, with/without feature X, using/not using library Y.<p>The configuration of the build can affect almost every aspect of the build.  Which tool/compiler is called, whether certain source files are included in the build or not, compiler flags (including what symbols are predefined), linker flags, etc.  One tricky part about configuration is that it often needs a powerful (if not Turing-complete) language to fully express.  For example, &quot;feature X can only be enabled if feature Y is also enabled.&quot;  If you use the autotools, you write these predicates in Bourne Shell.  Linux started with Bourne Shell, then Eric Raymond tried to replace it with CML2 (<a href=""http://www.catb.org/~esr/cml2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catb.org/~esr/cml2/</a>), until a different alternative called LinuxKernelConf won out in the end (<a href=""http://zippel.home.xs4all.nl/lc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zippel.home.xs4all.nl/lc/</a>).<p>Another thing missing from the analysis are build-time abstractions over native OS facilities.  The most notable example of this is libtool.  The fundamental problem libtool solves is: building shared libraries is so far from standardized that it is not reasonable for individual projects that want to be widely portable to attempt to call native OS tools directly.  They call libtool, which invokes the OS tools.<p>In the status quo, the separation between configuration and build system is somewhat delineated: ./configure spits out Makefile.  But this interface isn&#x27;t ideal.  &quot;make&quot; has way too much smarts in it for this to be a clean separation.  Make allows predicates, complex substitutions, implicit rules, it inherits the environment, etc.  If &quot;make&quot; was dead simple and Makefiles were not allowed any logic, then you could feasibly write an interface between &quot;make&quot; and IDEs.  The input to make would be the configured build, and it could vend information about specific inputs/outputs over a socket to an IDE.  It could also do much more sophisticated change detection, like based on file fingerprints instead of timestamps.<p>But to do that, you have to decide what format &quot;simple make&quot; consumes, and get build configuration systems to output their configured builds in this format.<p>I&#x27;ve been toying around with this problem for a while and this is what I came up with for this configuration->builder interface.  I specified it as a protobuf schema: <a href=""https://github.com/haberman/taskforce/blob/master/taskforce.proto"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/haberman/taskforce/blob/master/taskforce....</a>",1449547088

Then compliance prohibits the use of commodity components not designed with those specific requirements in mind, which requires everything to be custom for the industry at extreme cost, which in turn impairs competition and allows the vendors who do pay all the compliance lawyers to sell low quality software for big money.<p>And it&#x27;s not clear how open source or cloud would solve any of that, other than possibly through some kind of regulatory avoidance shell game, which sounds more like a loophole than a solution.",1449547044

Part of it is due to other interests and commitments...I read almost nothing for pleasure during grad school and then spent what felt like every non-working moment reading for the next year. Then there have been two periods where I read <i>The Economist</i> cover to cover <i>every</i> week. The first was two years the second was one...well almost or maybe most of one.<p>That sort of hits on the other major reason for cyclic reading. My tastes and interests change. Sometimes the right book comes along at the wrong time...and sometimes the same right book comes along twice, by which I mean that one of the interesting things about getting older is that rereading books is not rereading the <i>same</i> book. The greater narrative of which it is a part has changed as I have changed.<p>One of the other features of getting older is that <i>not</i> finishing a book doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore. I&#x27;m ok if a book doesn&#x27;t speak to me or stops speaking to me. I enjoy finishing books, but don&#x27;t see not doing so as quite the moral failing I once did. Maybe I&#x27;ll come back. Maybe it wasn&#x27;t that good. Maybe it&#x27;s overdue. Reading for pleasure is supposed to be pleasurable and the suffering of a hard book or long book or a challenging book has to be worth it, and making it worth it is the <i>author&#x27;s</i> responsibility, not mine.<p>Anyway, not having time is the biggest constraint, e.g. currently the time slot that I had been using to read is being used to journal.

10694635,comment,10688606,10688606,0,0,johncolanduoni,,,"I think a good way to handle this convergence would be to move away from repeated invocations of the compiler. Instead, your build system/IDE could keep an active instance of the compiler running that keeps the last generated ASG/intermediate representation/machine code in memory, along with bookkeeping information that remembers the relations between these. When a file changes/a rebuild is requested, this lets the build system to not only correctly identify dependencies, but also allows far more granular incremental compilation than is possible now. For example, if you really only change one function, then only that function&#x27;s code (and possibly any code which relies on optimizations based on that function&#x27;s form) need to be changed. You could even add more to this by tracking dependencies in unit tests and automatically re-running them when the result may have changed, or using it to facilitate some sort of live-coding.<p>This sounds like it would need a huge amount of memory, but IDEs already do this to the ASG level, and much memory and computation is wasted on the compiler re-generating the ASG in parallel when the IDE has a similar one already analyzed. The main disadvantage is it would restrict how build systems could be structured, as to pull this off the build system would need to have much more ability to reason about the build (call command X if Y has changed after Z won&#x27;t cut it). Macro systems would also need to be more predictable.<p>As far as keeping things non-monolithic, you could still have plenty of separation between each phase of the compilation process, the only extra interface you would need between passes is the more granular dependency tracking.<p>edit: grammar",1449546068

If we&#x27;d have 50 people and 25 ingots of iron, we&#x27;d only produce 100 forks and 15 novels.&quot; Which is retarded.<p>If you want to beat a strawman, be my guest. You can even get to call it retarded, it wont care. But to follow with your example.<p>If you start with 100 people + 50 ingots of iron -> 200 forks + 30 novels. Then you cut your inputs by half:<p>1. If you want the magic fairy of science to come and sprinkle its progress dust on the ingots so you can keep the same production as before... I am going be calling you something much more offensive than &#x27;retarded&#x27;. Most people around here have firts hand experience of how that kind of paralogic results at the end (ahem, Deathmarch).<p>2. If you value forks badly enough, you might get to produce maybe 120, not the 100 expected, but neither the 200 demanded. You will be able to do this by cutting on the novel writers and put them to figure out better fork designs and more efficient manufacturing projects. You will end up with like 3 novels instead of the expected 15, but probably 10 out of those were going to be crap anyways, so you did not miss much. The best creatives just have to go and express their creativity regardless of financial gain.<p>3. If you want to push your luck and build 150+ forks, you will succeed in the short term, but then you will face a fork crisis a few years down the road. You cannot apply infinite brain power to make infinitely better physical stuff. If you have only so much iron ore, and you try to make too many forks out of it, the material will be spread too thin and it will break under tenssion. Now your overworked 99 fork makers (1 recognized novellist, 2 moonlighting authors) will have to design a second process to refurbish the broken, low-quality forks, diverting valuable time and resources from making brand new forks.<p>So, do not dismiss those theories out of hand. You don&#x27;t have to agree 100% with what they say, but give&#x27;em the benefit of doubt and analyse them before making any judgements.<p>The issue with the crowd that hangs around this &quot;finite growth&quot; thing is another matter.

If such a hailstorm were ever encountered (unlikely, the record in the US is 1lb 15oz) then the helicopter would be completely destroyed.<p>If we consider a somewhat more sane hailstone size of 8cm, that has a terminal velocity of about 170km/h and weighs about 1.5lbs. And a helicopter is not going to survive flying through a storm like that either. This drone, by comparison, weighs twice as much. The helicopter&#x27;s cruising speed is about 245km/h, so that would be about the impact speed.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why anyone would think that a 3lb chunk of machinery moving at 150MPH relative to a helicopter wouldn&#x27;t go through the windscreen.<p>I also don&#x27;t understand why everyone in this thread is apparently so eager to minimize the risks presented here.

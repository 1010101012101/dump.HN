It has all the tools I use, all the power underneath, and it comes wrapped in a pretty pretty wrapper.<p>Linux to me has become a loose term for any Unix.  I've heard it used to refer to any of the BSD's, Solaris, and even OS X.",1177620237

17182,comment,17138,17138,0,0,jward,,,"Incorporation was really easy and fairly cheap.  My corporation has one shareholder, just me, and no real rules outside the formal ones needed to exist.<p>I did this for three main reasons.  First, I wanted to experience the paperwork and hassles when I wasn't on a deadline.  Second, it gives me a limited legal shield.  It's easy to say 'Oh yeah, that was done by the company!' if I ever get sued.  Finally, it's a good springboard if any of my ideas and implementations actually take off.<p>The structure is there <i>if</i> I need it.  The cost to get everything formalized was a few hundred bucks and about a hundred bucks a year to keep going.  Easy investment.  It will save me one more headache when things take off.<p>Also, it's nice to have business cards that say CEO on them.",1177619880

That's what options backdating is - stealing from the company's shareholders.<p>And by fining companies, the SEC is hurting those shareholders.  It's important for the shareholders (you and me) to realize that.  <p>It's like telling a thief: If the police catch you stealing: they're going to fine the victims as punishment.  What kind of motivation is that?",1177619703
17176,comment,16972,17108,0,0,Tichy,,,"That article falls a bit short, though. While probably there is no metaphysic power enforcing a karma balance, I like to think of the karma concept as simply another formulation of common wisdom. Some murderers get away with murder, but most probably don't, or if they do, they suffer from it etc. Likewise stealing ideas as a habit might eventually ruin your reputation and your career (although you might be filthy rich by the time).",1177619609
17175,comment,17138,17138,0,0,cwilbur,,,"Incorporating protects your personal liability somewhat, in the event that your startup tanks.  It can be a paperwork- and lawyer-intensive process, and if you wait until you're seeing significant traffic, you'll be converting from a sole proprietorship, which will make for even more paperwork and lawyering, at a time when you'd rather be focusing on technology.<p>\nIn short, if your company fails, you want to be incorporated because it protects your personal assets.  If your company succeeds, you want to be incorporated because it makes hiring and taxes and office leasing much simpler.  Venture capitalists won't fund a sole proprietorship, and they certainly won't buy one.\n",1177619243

While on the surface you might think you will be able to whip out a clone of one of the popular web apps easily (let alone a brand new idea) but you will find the devil is in the details.  What makes or breaks those sites are the thousands of minute implementation level decisions which build up to make a quality application.<p>",1177618231

This was a couple years ago, and driver support for the Centrino's built-in wireless was pretty spotty for Linux.  Rather than beat my head against it, I shelled out a couple hundred bucks for VMWare and mooch off the Windows wireless support.<p>VMWare gives a lot of other nifty benefits too, like I can burn my whole computer to DVD, swap it out, back it up, run multiple OSes, etc.  Free imaging too; I have a VMWare image with a base Debian install, all preconfigured with my favorite settings, and when I start a new project I just pop that in and copy it.",1177617747

356152,comment,355881,356040,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Realistically, I don't see a way other than strong, SSL-style crypto with private keys and AP certificates. I'd like to see a crypto expert analyse and write about RADIUS-authenticated WPA2 in a way us mortals can understand. My understanding is that it should be safe, but I'd like to hear about it from someone like Schneier. A lot of APs actually support RADIUS, but you do still need to set up your own RADIUS server somewhere on the network. I guess the open-source firmware available for some APs could help here.<p>My current OpenVPN solution is actually pretty user-friendly - it doesn't ""magically"" connect as soon as my AP comes into range, but it is just one click to start. It's almost certainly possible to run the script from the event directly. The nice thing is that you can implement this <i>now</i>, and OpenVPN runs on Linux, OSX, Windows, probably the BSDs too.<p>I also have an OpenVPN server that's accessible from the internet, which is handy to use from public wifi. I realise that it's not end-to-end encryption, but having my cookies etc. available to everyone around is just a little too scary.",1226008088

However, it doesn't allow you to sniff traffic that isn't headed your way. For example, Alice is using her laptop to load data from Bob's PC, which is attached to the access point. Eve cracks the AP's WPA passphrase and logs onto the network. She can initiate traffic to Alice and Bob's machine, but she can't see the data they're exchanging because individual wifi users' encryption is negotiated separately.",1226007318

356134,comment,355881,356129,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Absolutely. It definitely beats going with your average access point's default of bridging wifi to your LAN, though it does make your wiring slightly more complicated. I use two separate VLANs actually, one for the unprotected wifi access points and one for the actual LAN traffic. You have to watch out that you use high-quality VLAN-capable switches, however, as some of the cheaper ones fall over and supply the world with your protected packets if you fill up their MAC address table with spoofed packets... which is of course easy to do via an unprotected access point. That kind of thing might stil DoS you with a good switch, but it shouldn't open up your network.",1226007062

356130,comment,355719,356100,0,0,sridharvembu,,,"I believe we need a ""converse of Lisp"" - in Lisp code is data, I believe what we need is the notion ""data replaces (most) code"". That leads to the question, what really is data, and I believe Codd supplies the best answer to that question. One of the truly original ideas in Computer Science that post-dates Lisp (and is not anticipated by Lisp) is Codd's relational model of data, which is not to be confused with relational databases used for storage.<p>Note that Codd's model is not Turing-complete, while all but the most trivial definitions of code lead to Turing-complete systems, hence the parenthetical most in my ""data replaces (most) code"". Data is easy, code is hard could be another way to state that.<p>We have experimented with such ideas, and we can report that they do significantly improve clarity and therefore productivity.<p>As an aside to a pg essay, I believe clarity is <i>not</i> the same as succinctness and as a corollary, succinctness does not imply productivity except in the somewhat trivial sense of ease of typing.",1226006837

R is a good domain-specific language -- it has a great library of statistical methods for analysis and modeling -- but it's dog slow, a huge memory hog (i.e. forget large datasets), and has I/O facilities that are only a bit more advanced than what you get in FORTRAN 77.<p>My general research workflow was to do all of my custom logic in a faster, smaller language (i.e. Perl, C++), then to dump tab-delimited files that I could load into R for summary analysis and graphing.  I would also sometimes prototype my code in R (if it involved tricky matrix math or statistical models), then re-write everything in a more capable language when it came time to work with real data.<p>That said, R has its strengths -- the graphics language is <i>really</i> powerful, once you take the time to learn it.

356104,comment,355685,355897,0,0,Retric,,,"There are plenty of things that would change my stance on global worming.  But, like most long studied subject's there is a <i>lot</i> of evidence to back up global worming.  Everything from samples of arctic ice from thousands of years ago, to plant samples, weather models, and satellite data. But, the two basic factors that would change my mind are:<p>#1) A well defined mechanism that limits the impact green house gasses on temperature and weather.<p>#2) An accurate, global, and long term temperature measurement that strongly links global temperature to some other factor and shows little correlation with CO2.  Which is more accurate than all the other data we have collected to this point.<p>I studied the physics behind global climate models and there are other factors that impact temperature, but most of them are short term factors and CO2 has a stable long term impact.  At the basic level CO2 changes how much energy leaks to space though the atmospheric absorption gaps in EM spectrum.  At temperature rise that changes some but 280 kelvin vs. 282 kelvin is minor etc.<p>Local areas can experience dramatic shifts in weather but as a global system energy in must equal energy out +/= extremely tiny fractions which are stored / released energy. etc.<p>PS: I am willing to change my stance with new information which is why this is not a religious stance. But, without such information there is little reason to change my stance.<p>Edit: The reason I called his statement as a religious argument is it equated the process where I gathered data to a religious viewpoint.  However, if your staying that you feel global worming does not exist as a religious stance, I will stop talking, because there is little reason to present information to someone who does not care about it.",1226005225

It&#x27;s &quot;very long&quot; ie. No one has time to read it all and you shouldn&#x27;t either/it&#x27;s of bad quality and could easily be summarized.<p>&quot;I also encourage you to read this very different take by a current Amazonian:&quot;<p>- said article has no merit versus an article written by someone who actually works here. Never mind the bias.<p>&quot;Here’s why I’m writing you. The NYT article prominently features anecdotes describing shockingly callous management practices, including people being treated without empathy while enduring family tragedies and serious health problems. The article doesn’t describe the Amazon I know or the caring Amazonians I work with every day. But if you know of any stories like those reported, I want you to escalate to HR. You can also email me directly at [edited]@amazon.com. Even if it&#x27;s rare or isolated, our tolerance for any such lack of empathy needs to be zero.&quot;<p>- these are bizarre isolated cases, empathy must be respected. Probably because there are serious legal ramifications for us if we don&#x27;t so donth take it elsewhere, raise internally so we can make it go away. Also note that I dont mention working you to a pulp on weekends etc. Fuck you. You&#x27;re here to satisfy my &quot;vision&quot;.<p>&quot;The article goes further than reporting isolated anecdotes. It claims that our intentional approach is to create a soulless, dystopian workplace where no fun is had and no laughter heard. Again, I don’t recognize this Amazon and I very much hope you don’t, either. More broadly, I don&#x27;t think any company adopting the approach portrayed could survive, much less thrive, in today’s highly competitive tech hiring market. The people we hire here are the best of the best. You are recruited every day by other world-class companies, and you can work anywhere you want.&quot;<p>- again, isolated cases so all good. You better not think like that, you&#x27;re an &quot;amazonian&quot; we&#x27;re fucking hard to get into, we&#x27;re &quot;world class&quot;. You should be thankful we gave you a chance. We THRIVE mother fucker are you a loser or an amabot?<p>&quot;I strongly believe that anyone working in a company that really is like the one described in the NYT would be crazy to stay. I know I would leave such a company.<p>But hopefully, you don&#x27;t recognize the company described. Hopefully, you’re having fun working with a bunch of brilliant teammates, helping invent the future, and laughing along the way.&quot;<p>- if you feel like that get out. We don&#x27;t care. Get out. But if you don&#x27;t,  you&#x27;re a winner who laughs at working your life away for me while I amaze myself at what people will do to remain &quot;winning&quot;.",1439823295

Quite the contrary, I have plenty of bad experiences with HR that made me believe those things. I&#x27;ll give you my favorite examples:<p>I once got fired because I told some bitch (she was really a bitch, and that&#x27;s not just my opinion, the whole workplace thought of that) to mind her own business. I was on a break and reading a magazine when she came in and started lecturing me on to &quot;why I&#x27;m not doing other stuff? why do I read those kinds of magazines? (It was a gossip magazine, but who cares it was what it was nearby) I&#x27;m a little old for that.&quot; Politely but firmly told her something like &quot;This is my break. Fuck off, you can&#x27;t tell me what to do on my break and I read whatever I want to&quot;. She left. Three months later got called to get fired, turns out she was secretly raising reports about me that were small stuff (and completely fake) like &quot;... was asked to do X and refused&quot;, &quot;... yelled at a client&quot;, &quot;... reads magazines while at work (of course)&quot;. When I had like 10 or so of them she fired me because of a &quot;bad overall attitude&quot; and those were her (fake) proofs. That&#x27;s the kind of shit HR LOVES to do man.<p>Another one. I once knew (but not as in &quot;a friend told me&quot;, I saw it) of a place where all the candidates that got hired were because they were laying down with the girl that ran the interviews. Later when they got the job, they started to get fired when that girl found them not sexually appealing anymore. Yup.<p>I think there has to be something psychological behind that, because other while other teammates may be assholes your job does not depend direclty on them or you are pretty much at the same level. Since HR is above you and can fire you at will there is a lot of power bestowed to only one side of the parts involved. I think it may be some kind of Stanford Prison stuff right there.

If I  make any mistakes on the database security, the entire DB is already pre-leaked to the world? The final dencryption/encryption happens in client javascript, which is a whole other hornets&#x27; nest. Besides that, the implication is that I write my entire system stack in client javascript that is exposed to everyone, including any proprietary algorithms or credentials? Even if that was ok, and the system can live in the user cloud, where does system processing that is independent of user activity (scheduled tasks, etc) happen?

But (s)he would have to be aware that roughly 90% of what (s)he learned and enjoyed while doing combinatorics research would not be relevant to the job. The hiring would depend on a combination of how much of that lifestyle (s)he is willing to give up for this job, as opposed to trying to find a tenure track faculty position where (s)he could continue pursuing research, and how much the software company thinks about the enthusiasm of the candidate (to switch from research to software development).<p>Going through TAOCP and doing exercises and learning relevant math is a close approximation to that, IMO. Keep in mind that a significant number of exercises in TAOCP are about proving theorems.",1439822627

Upper management has a vision for the organization, but it gets lost on its way down the chain.  A simple phrase is the main culprit: &quot;...<any given policy> is up to manager discretion.&quot;<p>For example, upper management: &quot;We are creating a flexible part-time teleworking agreement whereby employees can work from home up to 2 days per week.  Usage of this arrangement <i>is up to manager discretion</i>.&quot;  Lower management: &quot;I know about the new teleworking option, but our department is not participating because how can anyone get work done at home?&quot;<p>If upper management does not actively monitor and intervene with stifling lower-level managers, they can definitely create an organization that, in practice, differs greatly from the one they imagine, the one they <i>wanted</i> to create.",1439820996

I think it&#x27;s one of those areas where, if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that corporate involvement would categorically be too politically incorrect, good (GOOD) ground-up UI/UX is a completely un-tapped field.<p>A few months ago I was thinking about the old MinWin improvements (to Windows&#x27; basic core services), how Windows 8.1/10 are (arguably) smaller and lighter than Vista, etc... and it clicked: Microsoft have realized they&#x27;re no longer the &quot;hardware industry killer app,&quot; if you will, and have moved out of the way... to let the Web take its place.<p>In my opinion, Web browsers are basically mind-bogglingly complex rube goldberg machines, based on conflicting standards that are also rube goldberg machines, and the whole scene is basically meta-rube-goldberg-ception.<p>A lot of the complexity and conflict is mostly due to the history and tradition behind the technologies we&#x27;re using: on the one hand, all you want is arbitrary sandboxed code execution and sane UI; on the other hand, sites start delivering content exclusively via JS and everyone gets mad. And in the meantime, who audits their web browsers? What was that about &quot;safe&quot; code execution, where the browser protects you from &quot;nasty&quot; code? We hear about <i>the browsers themselves</i> doing the wrong thing by users almost every week.<p>We need to fight this. I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that the only way this can be done is to simply <i>make the effort and do the hard graft to port a bunch of existing applications to a new coherent, practical modality/paradigm</i>, dump the whole thing on an unsuspecting world, and wait to see what happens next. It might catch on. It might not. Get feedback, try again. Keep trying until it goes viral enough to make a dent and improve people&#x27;s lives.<p>There are so many interesting and fascinating UI experiments out there, but nobody seems to want to commit to actually practically trying out a few of them in real applications :( and I think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s holding everything back - everyone&#x27;s waiting for everyone else to make the first move.<p>Here&#x27;s where I&#x27;d start: everything should be able to send messages to everything else, to work around the language problem; everything should be an object with arbitrarily settable properties - everything from the files in the filesystem to the windows on the screen; with the appropriate security context surrounding everything, you could do crazy things like programmatically share the tags you attach to the files you share over P2P, or tag images with text descriptions of their contents; the console should be inherently textual but in such a way that it is exclusively touch-gesture-drivable; I strongly believe in the anti-mac/post-mac UX paradigm; I believe that it&#x27;s impossible to create the &quot;ultimate&quot; solution that will work for everyone, and that all I can ever hope to do is nudge everything in what <i>I</i> think is a good general direction. And the only sane way to release an implementation like this is to put it into the public domain.<p>Agh, this probably reads like a rant, and I guess it is.

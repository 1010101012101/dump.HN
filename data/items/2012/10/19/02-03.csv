It is the people who sat at the opposite end of the interview table hearing 'no' too often that decide they had enough with society and create their own success.<p>Every single successful person I ever met starts with the same story: ""I was doing X, and I just quit. I promised that I would never have a job again."" Simply put, it is the mindset that is inherent in those that go out and create that make them create.<p>The reality is that people who have a lot to lose are those that aren't going to take a risk. Giving more raises, more insurance, and more social security is going to make people more comfortable with their life as-is.",1350615584

4672092,comment,4671530,4671796,1,0,brc,,,">The Agenda has often wondered if decoupling health insurance from employment might encourage entrepreneurship.<p>That is from the article.  It's a stupid comment.  Of course it will encourage entrepreneurship - no other outcome would make sense.<p>Why is health insurance coupled to employment anyway?  All you need to do is reform the health insurance market so that it is individual based, rather than company based - your employer does not pay for auto, home or life insurance, so why health?  To me, as an outsider looking in, it seems like collusion between big companies to make it harder for small companies to compete for staff.<p>As a non-US resident, I just buy my health insurance whether I'm working, not working, or doing whatever.  If I got a job with bigcorp limited, they might offer it as part of a package, or maybe get a slightly better rate due to group rates, but it's not a case where I have to be employed in order to get insurance.",1350615489

4672087,comment,4671926,4671970,1,0,001sky,,,"Think I wrote/deleted the comment you were repsonding to.  Let me re-summarize just for the conversation. Not all of this was in the original, nor what ended up in the edit.<p>Risk/Return is two-factor analysis. You might get lots of $ return from risking lots of money. You may get modest $ return risking everything you have. Who has the higher risk return? Well, on a proportional basis you need to know both factors.<p>> US has lots of $$$ big returns.  But there is very effective capital markets and legal infrastructure. A venture c-corp is not risking the entrerenuer's personal capital (per-se), in the same way as a self-funded business. The purpose of this setup is to take ""more"" risk with more money. The <i>less risk</i> there is structurally, then, the more risk is taken. Seeing lots of risk being taken is thus consistent with less actual risk being taken. When there is more <i>proportional</i> <return> than risk, you invest more. But sometimes those returns are not there without threshold-scale capital. You want to see massive risk? Invest in sub-saharan africa. Or in Afghanistan. Etc.  Those are counter examples, and people who take lots of risk ""with no safety net.""<p><i>Countries with much broader safety nets for entrepreneurs are not producing the risky innovative companies that America is.</i><p>On the flip-side, there are massive returns to minimal capital that happen all of the time. And massive innovation as well. Again, taking lots of risk, because they have little (but all) to lose. In this case, downside protection really does help people to take risk.  The classic example is Harry Potter.  Athough entire other areas (sports, fashion, music, art) are born ""on the streets"" everyday. Many of these folks (the most talented) benefit from a safety net (JK Rowling, for example). The willingness to take risk is there, its just not in VC backed data-points (for obvious, but also structral reasons--see above--its too risky). But these examples are in industries that are not capital intensive (human or physical) for a variety of reasons.  Thus, the don't look like SV. [Edit: also, while for society the benefits may be massive/large scale, it is also the case that not all the returns to to the creators or the takers of risk. this is espcially true in the latter examples where people have minimal capital but all to lose.]<p>Anyway, just some food for thought. or thoughts for food. =D",1350615307

The study that I remember reading was done in Australia with white wines that had been aged for 5 years with different closures(though in the same environment).

Synthetics had more oxidized notes, Screw cap wines tended to be reduced and have varietal characteristics consistent with younger wines, while cork aged as expected.<p>""Better"" is a subjective term, and most people would actually prefer the fruitiness of a youthful wine.

4672038,comment,4671196,4671196,2,0,tokenadult,,,"I live in Minnesota. I am enrolled for five Coursera courses (of which I am really keeping up with two, Keith Devlin's Introduction to Mathematical Thinking, a ""transitions"" course, and Mohamed Noor's Introduction to Genetics and Evolution). I have received no notification from Coursera to this effect. Checking my email messages from Coursera, I see no such notice, and logging into the site, there is no attempt to use geolocation to give a Minnesota-specific notice to me.<p>Moreover, I only see two blogs reporting this (one presumably cribbing from the other) as I do a Google News search. No local news organization in Minnesota has picked up this story. So thus far I'm not even sure that this is a true factual report. (I'll check with my state government during business hours tomorrow.) I doubt that this is true, and I doubt that this will hold up. Because I just met my incumbent state senator and state representative this evening (at a candidate forum in our newly redistricted state Senate district), I suppose I could contact their offices for immediate response to this issue, if there really is an issue here. My advice from a Minnesota Coursera student (who is also a lawyer familiar education regulations in the state of Minnesota, continually discovering new regulations that bureaucrats have ignored for varying lengths of time) is stay tuned for further news, and check the facts before proceeding to react to this.<p>AFTER EDIT: The first reply here refers to the Coursera terms of service,<p><a href=""https://www.coursera.org/about/terms"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/about/terms</a><p>not a very prominent link on the Coursera site, and in context the notice fits in a big wall of text like this:<p>""Notice for California Users<p>Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California Website users are entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 1625 N. Market Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.<p>Notice for Minnesota Users<p>""Coursera has been informed by the Minnesota Office of Higher Education that under Minnesota Statutes (136A.61 to 136A.71), a university cannot offer online courses to Minnesota residents unless the university has received authorization from the State of Minnesota to do so. If you are a resident of Minnesota, you agree that either (1) you will not take courses on Coursera, or (2) for each class that you take, the majority of work you do for the class will be done from outside the State of Minnesota.<p>Choice of Law/Forum Selection<p>""Sites are managed by Coursera, located in Santa Clara County, California. You agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use or any content posted to a Site, including copies and republication thereof, whether based in contract, tort, statutory or other law, will be governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law provisions. You further consent to the personal jurisdiction of and exclusive venue in the federal and state courts located in and serving Santa Clara County, California as the legal forum for any such dispute.<p>""Excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief, for claims related to the Coursera Sites where the total amount sought is less than ten thousand U.S. Dollars ($10,000.00 USD), either Coursera or You may elect at any point during the dispute to resolve the claim through binding, non-appearance-based arbitration. The dispute will then be resolved using an established alternative dispute resolution (""ADR"") provider, mutually agreed upon by You and Coursera. The parties and the selected ADR provider shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; rather, the arbitration shall be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, online, by telephone, online, or via written submissions alone. Any judgment rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.""<p>That's about midway down a rather lengthy ToS, definitely ""below the fold"" for a casual glance at usual screen resolutions. Again, I will say that Coursera has not sent any notice to users of Coursera about that by email (I searched in my emails again) and doesn't draw attention to that by geolocation as users log in. So while Coursera feels compelled to add terms to its ToS, at least as of this moment, there doesn't seem to be any actual change in user interaction based on this. I will contact the relevant offices in Minnesota and see what they have to say about this during business hours.

Coursera has put up a pro-forma legal notice, but it is still dealing with Minnesota students, and no one in Minnesota seems worried about signing up for Coursera courses.",1350613675

The idea that having a pre-existing condition can screw you pretty severely if you have to switch insurance ilproviders is crazy to me, especially since insurance is so tied to employer in the US.

Its overall level of safety nets, taxation, infrastructure spending, etc. is <i>much</i> higher than in the U.S. (tax revenues about 2x as high, as a percentage of GDP). But in some ways it's actually more privatized: for example, the bus system in Copenhagen is bid out to private corporations to operate. The government comes up with the fares, set of routes, etc., and then the corporations bid on how much subsidy they'd need to operate under the specified parameters (Movia won the current contract). Whereas, most American transit systems are operated by city or state employees.<p>And: it's fairly easy to fire someone, certainly easier than in most of the rest of Europe. The compensating factor is that the social safety net for the person who gets fired is also quite good, and not just in monetary benefits, but in active assistance to help them find a new job (both through job banks and training/internship programs). Incidentally, <i>that</i> is also outsourced, with a number of private (though subsidized and nonprofit) ""a-kasse"" social-insurance organizations competing for members. I'm a member of one that specializes in researchers, for example. If I become unemployed, for the first two years I would deal with them, not with the state. That tends to lead to people joining the organizations that they feel will provide the best job-finding assistance.

I think it depends on WHO is buying WHAT. For example, if I'm buying a pillow...yes, I'll buy the cheapest one available. If I were buying a watch, no. I'd be more than happy to pay over $10,000 for a watch (insane ah? if I could just convince the wife...) Why? because a different set of criteria come into play and the utilitarian aspect (telling time) loses importance (heck a $5 Casio can be more accurate sometimes). Things like the engineering behind the construction of the watch, the history of the brand, the materials used, etc, become purchasing decisions factors. The point is that for some it's worth $20 or more because it's either beautiful, stable, etc, or they might just like Tapbot as a company.<p>>Tweetbot is working against the precedent set by other apps in this regard. It yields near-negligible utility over free alternatives and competes in an ecosystem dominated by free apps. (If anything, it yields less utility over others, because once the token threshold is met, it will in all likelihood become abandon-ware.) Thus the value of Tweetbot and of software in general goes down.\n>The work put in by the developers has no weight in determining the price. The market's tolerance, perception of value, and willingness to pay is the only factor. Even if I spend 10,000 hours making a great latte, it's unreasonable that I charge $1m for it because my competitors are selling a similar product at $4 and the increase in utility of my latte versus theirs is likely not enough to warrant the increase in cost to the consumer. Their logic is flawed and is totally incongruous with the most fundamental concepts of economics. Commerce is a quid pro quo, not a charitable donation.<p>And yet...I'm confident and I really hope they sell enough copies to make a good profit out of a great product.<p>>You really can't fault them for price-gouging: Everyone loves money.<p>I truly disagree with this statement. It's not about greed.  Come on, they even took the time to explain to their users why they had charge more than they had initially planned.<p>>As for me, I won't be buying TweetBot. It's more money than I can reasonably afford. Even if it weren't, it's price simply outpaces it's value to such an extent as to be unjustifiable.<p>Look, you wrote it more clearly than me: it's about ""perception of value"".

In the end of the day, (for me) it is much more about learning and doing something I love rather than doing something to go on a resume (or my lack of a resume. :P). \nSo think about these questions:\n1. What is your goal in doing this? (i.e. combinations of to learn, to have fun, to add to the resume, etc.)\n2. What motivates sufficiently at 4AM in the morning?",1350612175

It's that I hear <i>predominately</i> stories that are negative to my side and positive to the other.

Plenty of trust fund babies face no risks and accomplish nothing.<p>Of course, another way to look at things is to realize that taking no risks is the biggest risk of all.  If one wishes to sit and wait for life to do whatever to you, you can always do that.<p>Don't go to school, don't strive.  Don't ever invest in anything that isn't 100% guaranteed.<p>No, there is already incentive to take risk.<p>If anything, the government ""help"" we've gotten so far makes it harder to take risks.  Just ask the people with student loans or those in an upside down mortgage if that helps them take risks.<p>Those programs are designed to help the person that goes down a specific track, not help the person who thinks different.<p>And those programs don't even actually help once they are converted into corporate welfare.",1350612094

Most people, if they want something, they'll buy it at any price they consider to be reasonable. Why? Because they really want it  just like people really want to be entrepreneurs, or don't. But lo and behold, when the price of a consumer good goes up, demand almost invariably goes down, because for some people, the cost/benefit equation did change just enough to make it (not) worth it.<p>I know many, many people in Europe that have dreams of starting a company or startup, but without ready access to venture capital, making that dream a reality suddenly becomes much, much harder. So you compromise, and you focus on other dreams that are more attainable.<p>Yes, human psychology might be an important factor in deciding whether someone wants to be an entrepreneur or not, but people's attitudes are generally not as black and white as you make them out to be.",1350612081

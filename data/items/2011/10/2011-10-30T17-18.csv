3174912,comment,3174599,3174599,6,0,ramanujam,,,"Being an international student at a US university you will get 12 months of OPT (Optional Practical Training) once you graduate. It is a free pass which allows you to work without any restrictions for one year in the same field of your degree. If you have your company registered by the time you graduate, you can use the OPT to work for the same. The OPT can be extended for another 17 months if the company is enrolled in e-verify (free registration with the USCIS). So, you can effectively get 29 months of work authorization without any external help.<p>If you company is successful and generates revenue/raises money in the first ~12 months you can file for your own H1B. I am not a lawyer but talk to the immigration officer at your university and also to a lawyer and you will get more information.",1319997518

I also believe, more generally, that the growing tendency to express  negativity towards people (instead of ideas) is just as much of a problem as frequent offtopic threads. Luckily, this is somewhat easy to fix, because it may be easier to remind participants to keep a respectful tone than to define what actually constitutes a hacker-relevant topic.",1319997446

3174905,comment,3173276,3174693,1,0,nhashem,,,"Well, just a few counterpoints here:<p>- I gave font size as very easy example, and there are dozens of products that make that very easy.  But a lot of our testing ends up being very heavily backend-oriented (e.g. ""let's try this new optimization engine combined with this optimization engine"").  So any third party tools probably won't be plug and play unless we made some fundamental changes to our web applications.<p>- And I have quantified making those changes long before the layoffs (although I had another in-house solution in mind, not one that used third-party tools), because even if 1% of engineering time is spent executing scripts like robots, that's 1% that could be better deployed into a profit center for the company.  The problem is, like I'm sure many engineers understand, is dealing with executives who don't quite grok the technical limitations of the current system, and who have a hard time prioritizing anything that doesn't directly lead to more money in the bank account.<p>- And this is my main point... so we had layoffs, and ended up coming to a defacto more efficient solution, which would be okay if me or anyone else involved in this solution was compensated accordingly.  Instead it's executives that will get lauded for cutting costs, even though the current solution now introduced a high risk of impacting our ability to actually execute on the aforementioned initiatives that would lead to directly more revenue.<p>- So basically, what I'm most frustrated about, is this: I had a proposal that would have improved an inefficient process.  That proposal got ignored, then we had layoffs, then we were forced to improve on that inefficiency in a way that wasn't that much more efficient.  If we ultimately get this all to work, the executives get bonuses for increasing profit by lowering headcount.  If it doesn't, they get cut loose with what I assume is some generous compensation package.<p>I'm not trying to just rattle some populist chains here or complain about ""the 1%.""  My point is, it's not the actual elimination of jobs and creation of 'shadow work' that is a problem, but the context of which is eliminated.  In most cases it sucks for the people whose jobs got eliminated, and it sucks for the people who now have do the shadow work because they're not seeing the rewards of the new efficiency (e.g. lower prices at the grocery store).  Instead, some layer of people highly detached from the process typically gain the most benefits.",1319997416

3174870,comment,3174599,3174599,2,0,hooeezit,,,"The critical parts to being an entrepreneur are to build a product, raise capital, manage a company and sell the product. For each of those pieces, you need a good professional network. Co-founders to build a product are easy to come by if you are studying for an engineering degree, but finding people for the other 3 pieces of the puzzle are equally or more important and are difficult for an engineering student. So, you have to spend an incredible amount of time networking both within the town/city you are in and in other major tech hubs. You will need to search for and attend every possible free/cheap gathering of techies and through them find people to help with the 'other 3 pieces'. But then there is this other big hassle that looms over everything else.<p>American immigration laws are specifically designed to keep people out, and that is the biggest barrier you will face. The only way around it is to find a local co-founder and sponsor an H1B visa through the company showing yourself as an employee. There have been recently proposed changes to the H1B rules allowing a sole founder to sponsor their own H1B provided they have investors investing in the company and the company has a board of directors. You will also need to wait a little for enough such cases to go through the USCIS to determine what's the winning formula for such H1B visa approvals. In parallel with all of your other efforts at finding people, you will hence have to find a good immigration lawyer who will also work on a project basis at low rates. Of late, USCIS has be onerous in demanding documented evidence for H1B cases, so you can very well rule out applying entirely by yourself.<p>The gist is that although it's possible, it's very hard to be an entrepreneur straight out of college if you are not from the country. The shortest route is to fall in love with an american (citizen) girl and marry her. And I don't say that in jest.",1319996542

There are several reasons for this but just going into one of the reasons as to why there should be a ban on these type of submissions is because, if you go to any political thread you will see that they all eventually turn into flame wars and because there has been an uprise in the political submissions around HN recently and as a result of these flame wars, they have been spreading out into other areas of the site which have been reducing the comment quality.<p>Likewise, I think people should stop saying ""This."" - I'm not going to fully go into this as it has previously been covered - <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.org/item?id=3153377"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.org/item?id=3153377</a> but its really of annoying when people just comment for the sake of commenting. I think that, if you are going to comment, then you should be commenting because you want to add your 2 cents and not because, you're commenting to say that you agree with someones comment yet don't add any other value because, this is what the ""up vote"" button is for. Maybe, some text could be added above the Add Comment button which says ""Does Your Comment Add Value? If So:""<p>I might not have enough karma to do this, or it might be not available to users but like the down vote (which I do have access to) I think there should be an option to flag comments which are deemed unnecessary by users (this could be implemented via a certain amount of karma) to remove some of the unnecessary comments in particular the ""This."" comments and the ones involving flame wars between users.<p>Likewise, I also think there should be an ""infraction"" system used on Forums. I think there is already a system like this in place, as I know if you get a certain amount of downvotes then, the post will get deleted etc but, on Forums the users are clear of their infraction points and it encourages ""good behaviour"" on the site after they rack up infaction points - making them be more considerate etc. The infraction system could work in the sense that - if you submit something that is ""fluff/banned on HN"" then you would get +2 infaction points likewise, a bad comment would get +1 infraction points.<p>Infraction Points would last 30-45 days and if you get 10 infraction points simultaneously then depending upon your karma you would receive a punishment such as:<p>Under 200 Karma - 24 Hour Submission/Commenting Ban<p>Under 500 Karma - 24 Hour Submission/Commenting Ban + Loss Of Header Colour Change<p>Under 750 Karma - 24 Hour Submission/Commenting Ban + Loss Of Header Colour Change + Loss Of Downvote.<p>ETC<p>Users would be allowed to earn the ability to have the header colour change and downvote button back via the Karma System.<p>Likewise, repeat offenders of Infractions would get more severe punishments. Such as having a script which shows for certain users, where the site keeps messing around whenever they try to do an action for a duration of time they are on the website.<p>Whilst, there are other smaller aspects which could be improved around the site, I think if these were tackled then Hacker News would have its strong community over the long haul and we won't see, flame wars/poor comments off users as often.",1319996448

One of the kids kept writing this big message on blackboards and stuff that Osama bin Laden was still alive.  One of the local volunteers read what he was writing and was upset at him for fooling around so much.  Later, I asked her what's up, and she told me what he was writing.<p>WTF.<p>So in the team meeting later that night, I talk with my fellow volunteers about this, and wonder if I have some kind of crazy kid on my hands.  Then the Chinese volunteers told me not to worry about it, he's just writing stuff.  I'm like, ""What do you mean, how do you know?""  Then they started talking about how people distrust the government these days, are unhappy, etc.  I'm like, ""What the heck does that have to do with anything?""<p>Turns out that all over the Chinese web, this was a really popular meme where Chinese youth displayed their sarcasm at anything the government said.  Even things that they knew to be true could not be true because the government said it.  It was only a meme, much like the Hitler videos we see on Youtube.<p>Scared me for a day.<p>But suffice it to say, people in China aren't so trusting of what their nation says as before.  Living here, I hear it from my colleagues and friends every day.

I am a graduate student in the humanities, and it sounds like many of these mechanisms aren't designed to extend beyond the sciences.  Most humanities research is not done with support from NIH grants, for example---at least, not directly.  Humanities faculty with smaller research budgets are less likely to voluntarily pay a fee to make their work open access through Elsevier and Springer.  And I don't know of open office humanities journals on the level of e.g. PLoS One (though of course that doesn't mean they don't exist!).<p>So, it sounds like the only mechanisms you've mentioned that might also apply to the humanities are institutional policies like Princeton's, or the Federal Public Research Access Act.  Princeton and other top tier research universities are in a unique position of leverage over journals, because few journals can afford not to accept research from faculty at these institutions, but most researchers are not working at institutions with that kind of leverage.<p>Does the Federal Public Research Access Act have language that extends to humanities research?  A lot of humanities research, I think, is <i>indirectly</i> funded through public funds, since universities take a cut of incoming grants for the sciences, and then redistribute that money to humanities departments.  The right language in this bill could therefore extend open access requirements to humanities research by requiring that whatever research the money ends up supporting be published open access.  Do you have any idea whether language like this is in the bill?<p>(I also worry that, if it isn't, even science researchers could start using the ""university cut loophole"": the university takes the entire incoming grant and redistributes it to science researchers without open access requirements attached.  Is there any danger of this?)",1319995427

3174796,comment,3163473,3164280,1,0,bdonlan,,,">  Transplants are still non-trivial in humans.<p>The biggest problem behind human transplants is that our defense mechanisms (which is a hard problem in computing!) will kill the foreign material. So it's a trade-off, not a hard problem.<p>In any case, the real difference between biological DNA and programs is the latter is designed to be modified in a _directed_ way. You could think of DNA as a highly compressed program which is modified _in its compressed form_. In evolution, changes are made randomly, so this isn't really a problem - if anything, the magnification effect is a good thing. But in computer programs, we know what we want to change, and don't want to have to make several million random changes to try to find one that brings us closer to the goal. And so computer programs are more brittle - small changes have small, predictable effects - while human DNA is more flexible, but at the expense of predictability.",1319994512

From some brief chats with <i>JMLR</i> editors, they're in that camp: they run on donated server space from MIT and volunteer editors. No staff, no office, no recurring expenses, yet they're still one of the top journals in CS. That seems like a significantly different cost structure from something like <i>PLoS ONE</i>, perhaps closer to the arXiv model turned into a journal.",1319994483

3174791,comment,3172430,3172430,1,0,JHLewisJr,,,"There are numerous paths for going back to school.  A big question is cash - Will you have enough to pay for school and take care of other obligations in your life (do you have a family? Mortgage, etc)?<p>Learning is always good - you just have to pick the method/path that works for you.  You also must keep your expectations inline with your abilities and method of schooling you pick.<p>Unless you go to a very good school or you want the full-time campus experience, you might be better off going part time.  At 30, you will not be part of the regular social scene - so you can gain most of the experience in a part time program.  If you live near a large city (New York, Boston, Washington DC, etc) there are very good schools that have programs aimed at you.  The hours are arranged for people with full-time jobs.<p>In your 10 years of work you have learned how to manage your time.  You are also much more motivated than you were when you were 18.  Studying and homework are easy compared to work.<p>If your company will reimburse tuition, you can afford the better quality, higher cost university.  Unless you have high hopes (move into research) just about any reputable school will be fine as you stated your goal is to learn and change the direction of your career.  Not having a BS is a handicap.<p>I highly recommend going back to school.  Look at the programs close to your location and weigh the benefits/costs of part time vs fill time.  Will the cash cost of going full-time be recouped by a much higher salary?  If you are serious, you can finish in 4 years if you take classes in the summer, test out of everything you can and take distance learning classes.  Maybe less than 4 years if your classes transfer.<p>It will be a lifestyle change - can you handle going to class 2-3 nights a week?  Read and study on the weekends?<p>Get some information and get started.  Even if you think there needs to be some changes in scheduling at work, I bet you could do one course a semester.<p>BTW - I went back and got my BS in CS after 5 years - then an MS part time and finally a PhD.  If you enjoy the material - it can be done.<p>Good luck!",1319994340

The vast majority of quantum physicists now agree Many Worlds has won, including Feynman, Gell-Mann and Hawking. The concept of 'collapse of the wavefunction' is silly and shouldn't even be considered for reasons outlined here: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/q8/many_worlds_one_best_guess/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/q8/many_worlds_one_best_guess/</a><p>> Determinism; Philosophers disagree.<p>It's just basic reductionism. There are absolutely no fundamental problems surrounding this.<p>> On the subject of morality, neuroscience cannot possibly deliver any concrete answers at all.<p>All moral thought and all moral beliefs up to now have happened inside the human brain. Most moral thought is confused and self-contradictory. If we want to figure out why we are moral the way we are, what our ""true"" moral beliefs are, and how to build societies that flourish, we have to look inside the brain to see how it all works. Either morality has bearing on the real world and is therefore subject to measurement or it has no bearing on the real world and is therefore irrelevant.<p>> Then we don't really understand logic and math either, do we? The foundations of logic and math are still part of philosophy after all.<p>Where the line is drawn between math/philosophy isn't a very interesting question.<p>> And, well, Hume didn't really understand causality, did he?

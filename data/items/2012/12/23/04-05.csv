OOP is, I would argue, <i>about</i> managing incomplete knowledge, on the (correct) assumption that if systems get large, it will be inevitable that people don't understand all the details of what they're working with.<p>Good abstractions deliver a lot of value. Files and sockets, for example, should be treated as objects, because the client should (usually) be agnostic of how the things are actually implemented. So OOP isn't all bad.<p>What's messy is a paradigm that gives an unbounded right to inject complexity. Programmers don't have enough autonomy in most corporations to do things right, so the result in most cases of Brownian-motion requirements is an increasingly gnarly pile of hacks.

Probably nowhere near as detailed\n   as your studies, but I enjoyed it.\n  B: Oh?  Which course?\n  A: Science fiction.\n  B: Never took that one.  Which books did you read?\n  A: A bunch of Heinlein, some Ursula LeGuin.\n  B: I never liked Heinlein - thought he was a sexist pig.  I love LeGuin though.\n</code></pre>\nThe problem with asking a lot of questions is that there's unequal emotional investment between a question and an answer: the answerer is putting themselves out there a lot more than the questioner.  (This is one reason why he who asks the questions controls the conversation.)  If you're trying to build a relationship, this feels very awkward.  Instead, the point of most conversations is to find & build a connection between the two people, one that lets both of them feel safe simply volunteering information and knowing that the other person is interested.  By relating topics back to yourself, you a.) give both parties a chance to ask questions, and b.) show that you're in the same boat as them, and so they can feel free to open up to you.<p>Notice that conversations between close friends rarely have questions - they consist of people taking turns volunteering new information, often rather animatedly if they have good rapport with each other.

The end-user will price-shop, but unbeknownst the end-users, all the distributors get their stuff from the same few suppliers. The end-users squeeze the distributors, and the distributors squeeze the suppliers, and it ends up no one makes any money. This then gets compounded because China is raising their prices, and at times, choking off the supply chain completely. After the end-users can't find what they want, they just look online and order direct from China.<p>I've been convinced for quite a while that price-slashing is the ultimate killer. The only advantage US suppliers have at this point is keeping foreign-bought stock locally so that they can deliver in less than a week. End-users are learning very quick, especially with the price of software decreasing, that keeping things in-house is not only more convenient, but cost less too.",1356236573

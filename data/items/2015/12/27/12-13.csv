But none of my friends were in honors and this created one of the worst times of my life.  The previous year had been one of the best.<p>In that dark year, at 14, I became focused on hacking and social engineering.  I had lost my best friend and girlfriend, and the dynamics of it all isolated me from my other friends.  Being 13 and somehow in love with the prettiest girl and then losing it all was devastating.<p>I barely graduated but had a fun and worked on cool side projects.<p>At 18, I met a hardware engineer and went on to work on various projects.<p>I have had a lot of interesting job offers or deals just by meeting people.<p>I had a major investment bank recruit me but I never even had a real job and probably couldn&#x27;t get hired at Burger King.  The deal I was offered was absurd.  In the end, I declined it and somewhat regret it.<p>But my point is, had I dated that girl throughout high school, I probably would had went to a great University.  And today would be some strange diminished version of myself.",1451221164

When there is low utilization in your neighbourhood it&#x27;s fine but when everyone is home for the holidays for example it becomes unbearable.<p>For example, I usually get about 8ms to a server hosted in the same city as me (10ms to google) but on bad days it gets as high as 60-80ms.<p>I regularly tether my LTE enabled phone where I get around 20ms but it&#x27;s consistent.",1451221162

Your modem can bond multiple channels on the same coax but each channel is shared amongst all the subscribes on the CMTS. Each DOCSIS revision ups the spatial efficiency of each channel but also ups the number of channels.<p>On a side note, my ISP incentives users to upgrade their modems by offering more bandwidth for the same money if you buy a modem that can bond more channels. For example I had a 8/3 DOCSIS 3 modem on a 60mb plan, for the same price they gave me 100mbit for upgrading to a modem that could bond 24/8.

The local CC has an arrangement with UCLA, so if the student gets good grades in a specific curriculum, they are guaranteed admission to UCLA for their final two years of college.<p>In theory, that&#x27;s great, but in practice the CC is underfunded and there aren&#x27;t enough classes offered, so it takes 3, or even 4 years, to get into all the classes required for the transfer. Upon getting into UCLA they find their department won&#x27;t accept some of their CC classes for credit because they weren&#x27;t rigorous enough, or that they need some prereqs that weren&#x27;t offered at the CC, and it will actually take 3 years at the UC campus to graduate. They enter the workforce 2 years after their peers who went straight to 4 year universities and the 3 years of CC is easily more expensive than the 1 year of UC tuition saved, especially considering they fed and housed themselves for 2 extra years. Their lifetime earnings drop or they have to retire later.<p>None of this is their fault, either: The CC eagerly offers the few students who successfully (and luckily) navigated the class scheduling and credit transferring bureaucracy as the mode, and a 17 year old kid -- likely the first in their family to attend college -- isn&#x27;t equipped to evaluate those claims. After all, why would they distrust the CC? They&#x27;re told they&#x27;ll save money and graduate at the same time, with the same degree, as their friends who went straight to UCLA and there&#x27;s no reason for them to doubt that.<p>While I&#x27;m sure many CCs are perfectly good places to spend the first 2 years of college, there are at least some tar pits out there. It&#x27;s a real shame, too.",1451220707

That and I am probably too enamored with the belief that &quot;making predictions is hard, especially about the future&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s another saying as well, which I think <i>might</i> be a billg thing (but don&#x27;t quote me on that) which goes something like this (paraphrased a bit probably) &quot;People tend to overestimate the magnitude of technological change in the short-term (2-3 years out) and under-estimate the magnitude of technological change in the long-term (say, 10+ years)&quot;.<p>I find that&#x27;s largely true.  Next year, most things will be mostly like they were this year, just incrementally different.  2017 will be mostly like 2016, and so on.   But somehow these amazing things tend to sneak in there just the same...<p>I guess I still didn&#x27;t actually make any predictions, did I?  OK, find, you twisted my arm. I&#x27;ll take a stab at some:<p>1. Wikidata will continue to grow in maturity and scope and will be a terrifically import piece of the Semantic Web as it continues to grow.<p>2.  People will continue to insist that the Semantic Web is dead, and you&#x27;ll see  a continuation of something like an analog to the old saying &quot;once it works, people stop calling it AI&quot;. Nobody will ever say that the Semantic Web has arrived, but we&#x27;ll be using Linked Data and related technologies (although perhaps not the RDF/SPARQL stack)<p>3. I&#x27;ll predict that at least one new (or new&#x27;ish) probabilistic programming language will gain some major traction in 2016.<p>4. Hadoop / Spark / etc. will continue to grow in the enterprise and start to move beyond POC&#x27;s and demos.<p>4.5 - but most businesses are still just spitting in the wind, stumbling in the dark, etc. when it comes to <i>actually</i> becoming more scientific / data-driven.  But you&#x27;ll see more &quot;stuff&quot; (tools, technology, methodologies) etc. promoting the use of scientific thinking, analysis, etc. in business decision making.<p>5. Zeppelin will grow in popularity as people write additional integrations / interpreters for it.<p>6. MOOCs will continue to eat the foundation out from underneath traditional education.  It&#x27;s arguably already the case for programmers and people like us that a traditional university degree isn&#x27;t all that important for many jobs; and  more employers will start really looking at certificates from things like Coursera classes and hiring people without those traditional degrees.",1451219510

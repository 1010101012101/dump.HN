262560,comment,262460,262535,0,0,bjclark,,,"LOL, I don't think the github guys are worried about pissing off the lighthouse guys. Hell, you can do issue tracking in git itself with Scott Chacon's awesome Ticgit (<a href=""http://github.com/schacon/ticgit/tree/master"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/schacon/ticgit/tree/master</a>). I would think it would take them a day to slap a web interface on that.<p>Instead, I think they don't WANT to do ticket tracking. That's not what github is about. It's a social network built around code. I don't think it's a business oriented project management site.",1217469521

262558,comment,262513,262513,0,0,theantidote,,,"Great. I can see positive responses that a person may have to a demonstration of Vista by a trained salesperson.<p>We have no idea how many thousands of people Microsoft had to go through in order to elicit these few positive responses.<p>I work in IT and Vista is just a major headache. It's fine once you get used to it and turn off all the flashy features, but at that point it's hard to see the difference between it and XP. There are a lot of changes for the sake of change, and many of them hurt usability a lot. For example, the old Network Connections control panel has been changed and hidden multiple mouse-clicks deep for no real reason. What if I want to enable a network adapter? There's no easy way to do it!<p>Maybe the next version of Windows will bring real changes that make sense, rather than slapping a pretty face on an old OS and changing things around just enough so people don't notice it's the same thing.",1217469352

262556,comment,261829,261829,0,0,ars,,,"Very interesting, but the problems have less to do with raising life expectancy than they do with a drop in birth rates.<p>The former is easily enough fixed: raise retirement age. The problems of the old ""blocking the way"", are not a problem if there is growth.<p>But a drop in birth rates is a big problem that has little to do with life expectancy, most countries are built on growth. Few know how to manage things with a shrinking, or static population.<p>And to make it worse the higher the class of the person/country, the less kids, which is very bad. Reminds me of the idiocracy movie.<p>Plus those that can most afford it have the least kids, again, that's not right.<p>So everyone: if you consider yourself better then average, take a pledge to have lots of kids. You owe it to the future.",1217469210

I went down to check out Gangplank tonight, and the guy I talked to (who worked for one of the companies down there) said he wasn't sure if you'd ever been to a Gangplank event! (He did know who you were though; I'd asked for you so I'd have the news.YC connection to get an explanation about what was going on down there).<p>Anyways, it seemed pretty cool over there, but it's definitely just a step up from going to the coffee shop to code - I guess I should have brought my laptop and a project to work on.<p>I think I'll check out Refresh next; that sounds like a pretty good stop.",1217469188

Watch the individual videos:<p>- a lot of MS:""this is really vista.""  pawn:""really?""<p>- a lot of MS:""Here, let ME show you _randomGadget_"" pawn:""huh. wow.""<p>One thing I notice is what few actual pawn responses are given, seem to be coming from people who either a) have never touched or seen Vista aside from this 5-10 min DEMO or b) have never touched or seen a computer aside from this 5-10 min demo or a kiosk at their local mall...  Again, this is DEMOED by a MS rep - these pawns don't even get to touch the box or use Vista...<p>Vista looks pretty at first - thats about it - and that really all that is required to convince people that an OS's UI looks friendly with just an glance.  The real trick is taking the OS home, putting it on your box and continuing to like it after the novelty wears off - exactly what did not happen.  Instead, countless people, MS fans and haters alike, obtained Vista, installed and used Vista and then decided they did not like it.<p>I was really excited about Vista - until I used it for about 2 weeks... Then I became tired of the excessive boot times, the sluggish performance on app load and the general bugginess of it all - on my new dual core 2.4 ghz, 2GB machine... Then I installed Vista, run XP virtually and could not be happier... I have booted Vista several times over the past couple years to update and try it again - always go back to Linux...<p>But thats just this pawn's experience.",1217468677

I believe you can be very successful as an individual, but this will be limited by your capacity.<p>One person can go only so far (not that this is by any means insignificant e.g. PlentyOfFish apparently serves millions of uniques and earns US$10,000 per day with a staff of one). ""Singles"" will inevitably hit a glass ceiling where they will need more resources if they want to break through.<p>The secret to continuing your initial success is ensuring that these additional resources can leverage off your initial good work AND add value of their own in excess of the complexity added/strain they place on you and your new ""organisation"".

I hate that the maximize, etc buttons are just colors with no symbols, I can never remember what each one does.<p>The finder folder windows have tons of unused space that should be filled with buttons for useful actions.

It wasn't pre-emptive until at least Windows 95, after a decade of work, when a typical PC had much more than 4 MB RAM. The hard work of designing a good, modern GUI was done by PARC and Apple; Microsoft just had to reimplement it for different hardware.<p>I don't think Windows was good until Windows NT 4/Windows 2000.<p>Don't act like Microsoft's success is entirely due to engineering, nothing to do with IBM's retarded decisionmaking, nothing to do with Bill Gates's extralegal bullying, and nothing to do with John Sculley's mismanagement of Apple.<p>Getting back to Raymond Chen, he finds Windows' annoying quirks and flaws to be amusing.

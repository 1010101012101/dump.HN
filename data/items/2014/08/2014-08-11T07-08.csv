One of such popular template comes in the form of &quot;X number of reason why Y is not true&quot;. Although these bullet points doesn&#x27;t seem such a &quot;creative&quot; content, in the experiment these kind of template-based approach won hands down VS asking people to come up with something original. Why? Because most people suck at being original and creative. It requires years of experience + some level of genius gene and avoiding pitfalls and keeping delicate balance to be original. So if you can&#x27;t hire 75 Oscar Wilds, then your best bet to create the popular content is follow the templates.<p>BuzzFeed&#x27;s model is simple.

[0] And the A380 itself is not the largest plane ever built [1] - the sizes we&#x27;ve standardized on are an economic tradeoff of land availability, energy consumption, and carrying capacity.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s not just planes that a train competes against, but automobiles; simply, if more people drive, we waste more energy. The state&#x27;s planners have run the numbers and determined that HSR will diversify the transit capacity cost load and make it less risky to hit capacity targets 20 years out. [2]<p>In current urban planning practice, rails are preferred as a way to encourage dense and sustainable development; when you go downtown-to-downtown, the land value around those hub stops skyrockets. The Japanese rail system was built around this principle, encouraging the rail companies to be real estate investors as well as transportation companies - as a result, the trains go to nearly every major destination. In the case of CA HSR, the stops in the Central Valley will become secondary hubs for businesses that want equal transit times between SF and LA. This puts the Central Valley towns on a more stable economic footing and is good for the overall welfare of the state.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/2044309/#9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/re...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_large_aircraft"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_large_aircraft</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.transformca.org/sites/default/files/moving_ahead_with_high_speed_rail_sept_2012.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.transformca.org/sites/default/files/moving_ahead_...</a> (page 31)",1407741794

What I (mis)understand to be happening here is &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot;; it doesn&#x27;t at all appear to be a free choice on the particle&#x27;s part.<p>In essence we established via the KS paradox that our two particles couldn&#x27;t have &quot;agreed&quot; on their spins ahead of time, because there&#x27;s no consistent way to assign all of their spins.

If it were the case that the particle was deciding its spin at measurement time (explanation (2)), wouldn&#x27;t the two particles have to communicate faster than c (or whatever our speed limit is) in order to ensure that they made the same decision?  We explicitly ruled out this possibility via the FIN axiom and our experimental setup.<p>The only way I can think of to make this work is to say that the universe doesn&#x27;t &quot;choose&quot; which result I got until I meet up with my friend who measured the other particle.

8162271,comment,8160395,8160395,3,0,dgreensp,,,"Conway&#x27;s description of entanglement is misleading.  FIN does not actually apply here.  According to quantum physics, no information is exchanged between the particles.  If information is exchanged, it is not limited to any finite speed we know of.<p>The thought experiment he describes is well-known in the popular science press: you create two particles with opposite spins (angular momenta), but such that the spins are not determined.  As soon as you measure the spin of one the spin of the other becomes determined -- INSTANTLY.  There is no speed-of-light limit here.  If you describe the situation as two particles colluding by sharing some &quot;information,&quot; then FIN does not apply, as far as we know!  (And if there is a limit, it is greater than the speed of light.)  A physicist would instead say that no actual information is transmitted, and entanglement cannot be used to transmit information faster than the speed of light.<p>Since the metaphor of wave function collapse as information sharing between particles leads to incorrect physics, I don&#x27;t think we should read too much into the metaphor of measurements as &quot;free choices&quot; of a particle.",1407740533

That doesn&#x27;t mean it didn&#x27;t have side effects.<p>I don&#x27;t understand your problem with people criticizing some of the things they did. It&#x27;s just saying they wouldn&#x27;t be attracted to the conference. It&#x27;s a piece of information the organizers can ignore or not, it&#x27;s their conference.<p>I suppose in economic terms it will work out because having more women will attract more men. What mix of people they&#x27;ll have is another issue.",1407740532

I don&#x27;t care that I&#x27;m downvoted, that&#x27;s fine by me (muh fake internet pointz!), but to see how often HN users try to feel smug and superior over other communities while doing the same thing is frankly hilarious and sad.",1407740494

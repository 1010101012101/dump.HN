The number of times that I have been shocked by people's behavior towards my coworkers and myself is ghastly.<p>One thing I find interesting is how the actors in these situations tend to have the idea that such behavior is always going to end with their desired result. Or, to put it another way, the actions have gotten them what they want in the past so they continue to act in said manner because they believe it will deliver repeat results and it usually does.<p>I have been lucky to work for employers that have, I feel I can say, trusted and respected my decisions and abilities. And, with that preface, I offer you this... Challenge these actors whenever possible. Once I reached the emotional maturity where I was able to not allow such the actors actions to impact me emotionally, I decided that I was no longer going to allow myself to be attacked for trying to help or serve their needs. Instead, I put a smile on my face and refuse to help them unless addressed or treated in a respectful nature.<p>I have challenged these actors in many different types of situations and some of the results are what you would expect, dissatisfied and angry patrons/customers. But, that is exactly what they were before, right?? Many, though, upon realizing they weren't going to get what they wanted began to change their ways. At first, begrudgingly, but on the second or third visit/encounter with particular customers I could see that their actions were becoming more polite and sincere. It sounds weird, but it is almost like they developed a sort of respect for me standing up to them.<p>Of course, I understand this doesn't apply to every situation and is not going to be possible for a lot of people.

Pretty much everyone supports children being automatically treated as their mother's property - including feminists - to the point that if you stand up to this you'll almost certainly be accused of wanting kids to be their father's property. The accusation usually sticks too - it's such a deep-rooted assumption that everyone just talks about doing what's in the ""best interests"" of the kids without even stopping to think whether it is.<p>Not even if it involves an underage rape victim paying child support to his rapist to raise their kids. Not even if it means keeping the father of some kids away from them long enough for their mother to brutally murder them, ignoring the warning signs she was showing and just choosing the ""safe"" option of assuming their father is dangerous based on his gender.

3367875,comment,3366268,3367107,5,0,larsberg,,,"Yes, certainly the vector instructions. There are a few keys issues many C compilers seem to run into today:<p>- Loop unroll identification is really bad. For example, ICC will unroll and turn a single-level loop with a very obvious body into streaming stores if the increment is ""i++"" but not if it is the constant ""i+=1"".<p>- The register allocation problem has some subtelties. Many of the SSE registers overlap the name of the multiple packed-value register with those of the individual ones (e.g. ""AX = lower 16 of EAX""), so knowing that you want four numbers to be in the right place without additional moves means a little bit more thinking.<p>But, there's also very little control-flow analysis done or global program analysis done except for some basic link-time code generation and profile-guided optimization. There's a lot you can do (e.g. cross-module inlining; monomorphizing to remove uniform representation; dramatic representation changes of datatypes), though admittedly some of it requires a more static language with some additional semantic guarantees.",1324252145

3367873,comment,3361322,3365235,2,0,chc,,,"You referred to the number of votes the post got. I was saying that's a red herring. Given a choice between a great question about the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of a feature in Clojure 1.4 and a picture of a cat in front of a computer, several orders of magnitude more people would vote for the cat than the programming question. This is why getting a lot of votes doesn't really prove relevance.<p>As for ""I know the exact rules better than you know the exact rules"": I don't see that at all. The rules are pretty simple. Here's a summary  if you follow it, you will not get your question locked:<p>1. Is it about programming?<p>2. Is it possible to give an objectively correct answer?<p>3. Is it stated politely?<p>In the particular case of this question, it doesn't even try to follow #2. It's an <i>interesting</i> question, I agree, but there's no right answer, so it's not a good Stack Overflow question. S:N ratio is extremely important on a site like Stack Overflow (because the people who answer questions well lose interest fast when they can't find good questions to answer, and vice-versa), so it is important to make sure that the site sticks closely to its purpose.<p>Incidentally, this isn't true of Wikipedia. Some of its rules make the site better, but a lot of the rules exist more for their own sake than because not following them would ruin the site (e.g. an article that's just descriptions of Pokemon episodes is pretty useless, but it doesn't make the article on Afghanistan less useful).",1324252052

You can maintain a local Git cache that contains the newest tree and clone from that; Git uses hard links, so the clone will be fast. So something like:<p><pre><code>    cd $cache && git fetch origin && git reset --hard $version && \
      git clone $cache $temp && ln -sf $temp $current
</code></pre>
Of course, apps can be designed to avoid the race condition, by caching the application's files. Rails and Sinatra will do this (but only for Ruby files), for example.

The current batch of self-checkout systems are very very fragile.  It seems that instead of optimizing them for throughput/efficiency, they optimized them for detecting if you are trying to steal something.  For example, something as simple as brushing the weight sensor will trigger an alert that takes 15-20s to go away.  There's really no reason to do that unless you are worried about people stealing.  In reality, checking the weight is a very poor way of detecting this (every system I've seen has an ""I'm using my own bag"" option that makes the alert go away.<p>These are actually very unoptimized from the UI point of view too.  For example, most of the people have their own loyalty card they scan at the beginning.  Why not track these, and adjust settings on the machine based on it?  For example, I mute the volume whenever I start, that would be nice to keep track of.  Defaulting to showing me a list food that I've purchased over my last few trips would make things go quicker instead of me having to dig through pages of items looking for common things.",1324250433

3367806,comment,3365858,3366133,1,0,cnunciato,,,"See, statements like this really get under my skin, because they're wrong in so many overlapping and crisscrossing ways, it's hard to know where to begin in responding to them.<p>First, ""Flex/AIR"", as you say, doesn't make sense -- there is no such thing as ""Flex/AIR"".  Flex is one thing (a bunch of open-source code), AIR is another (a bunch of runtimes).  You can't just throw a slash between them and call them the same thing, because they aren't, and indeed Adobe's roadmaps for both are completely separate and in this case divergent.  To those who aren't familiar with the Adobe stack, it sounds like you know what you're talking about, but to those who do, you just sound like yet another uninformed FUD-spreader.<p>As an ActionScript framework, Flex is only ""dead-end"" insofar as the Flash player itself is dead-end, which at near-total penetration on the desktop puts it about as far from extinction as anything could be.  Flex per se, as a Flash-targeted framework, is only dead-end if someone builds something better to replace it, which also doesn't appear to be happening anytime soon, as those of us who do choose to use Flex generally happen to like working with and contributing to it.  And last I checked, open sourcing a project was anything but sentencing it to death by definition.<p>Despite abandoning Flash for mobile browsers, Adobe is actually redoubling its efforts around Flash for the desktop and the various AIR runtimes, which are, of course, extensions of the Flash player.<p>And not for nothing, but polygeek is already a Flash developer -- he's not ""putting his effort"" into learning these skills; he already knows them.  He's merely complaining about the prospect of having to learn another way of doing something he already knows how to do and enjoys.<p>For my part, I'm equally experienced in both the Flash stack and in Web scripting, and I dig both; I love my Flex and love my jQuery, love JavaScript and the prospects (if only partially realized) of HTML5, and I've been around long enough to know that both have their applications and there are plenty of places where they don't even remotely overlap -- despite how often comments like this seem to suggest their interchangeability.<p>So yes -- if you're writing Web apps that'll have to run in mobile browsers, then obviously, you shouldn't use Flash.  But Flash and AIR are not going anywhere, and Flex is there for your use if you like.  That's a little closer to the truth than ""Flex/AIR are dead-end platforms.""<p>FWIW, I'm not responding at this length just because I think you're wrong and feel some need to correct you.  As a consultant, fairly recently, I has a good-size project go less than spectacularly because some underinformed product manager decided to impose a ""no stinking Flash!"" policy on an application intended to run solely on desktops simply because she'd gotten the sense somewhere, God knows where, that HTML5 was trendy, and Flash was passe (and despite my having built several successful Flash projects for them previously).  The problem, as I was forced to point out repeatedly as we went through the project, was that many of the functional and design requirements they'd set for it were tailor-made for Flash and Flex and trivial for them, but because they'd excluded it as a technology choice, the equivalent functionality without Flash would require considerably more time, be less uniformly compatible, and in some cases just couldn't even be done.  By enforcing no Flash, they ended up with an inferior product, and all because of an arbitrary and unnecessary technical constraint.  (And on the next project, they opened the door to Flash again.)",1324249991

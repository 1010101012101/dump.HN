The old world is actually far more diverse than the USA, where a single language, culture, political system and economy dominates in all corners, and is continually more homogenized by the mass media and highway system.<p>It is just that you don&#x27;t see the diversity in foreign cultures, or don&#x27;t rate the diversity you do see as relevant, while your brain exaggerates the diversity within the culture you are familiar with. It&#x27;s the same mechanism that makes &#x27;all Chinese look alike&#x27; to white westerners, and &#x27;all westerners look alike&#x27; to people in China.",1387357141

Thanks to generators and arrow functions, ES6 lets you write code using either.<p>When you&#x27;re writing in functional style, you&#x27;d use arrows, which work nicely both for small lambdas and for writing combinators that can be partially applied. When you&#x27;re writing in a more procedural style, generators are your &quot;do syntax&quot; equivalent(-ish):<p><pre><code>  async(function* getCredentialsByToken(token) {\n    credentials = yield NewCredentials(token)\n    return User.findByName(credentials.userName)  \n  });\n</code></pre>\nES6 is a lot more powerful than it looks :)",1387357055

But, now that China is strongly incentivized <i>not</i> to invest in Bitcoin, it&#x27;s going to be a very slow climb back to $1106.  And at the end of that long road (I&#x27;d say at least several months, but what the hell do I know, right?) I get to look forward to:  &quot;Yay.  I&#x27;ve lost $0.  I&#x27;ve also gained $0.&quot;<p>EDIT2:  Oh, nope!  It just fell from $520 to $500.  So, at current market prices, my $11k is now $4,780.  Of course, we&#x27;ve all seen bitcion dip and quickly rise again.  It&#x27;s just very... interesting... to me that within the timespan of writing a HN comment, I&#x27;m down another $320.<p>Yes.

I&#x27;m going to go build a product and sell it now.<p>EDIT3:  The market rose from $500 to $540, so that means I&#x27;ve earned back $474!  And since my last edit was an hour ago, that must mean I&#x27;m earning $474/hr writing HN comments in my pajamas!  Why hold down a programming job when you can write HN comments fulltime for 4x the wage?  Quit tomorrow, sell everything you own, and invest it all in bitcoin immediately!",1387355690

This makes it less than efficient when both people are at the same knowledge level. The extra eyes looking for bugs is debatable; the bugs are more thoroughly found with tests.<p>Test-first TDD is even less popular. Norvig vs Jeffries was enlightening - <a href=\"http://devgrind.com/2007/04/25/how-to-not-solve-a-sudoku/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://devgrind.com/2007/04/25/how-to-not-solve-a-sudoku/</a> .<p>Software does have a much heavier focus on testing than it used to, to the point that in many projects, everything is implemented twice - all features have two representations, one in the form of the implementation, another in the form of tests, and often with the lines of test code outnumbering the implementation.<p>But other things have suffered IMHO; making code easy to test tends to over-abstract it, making it more parameterized and exposing more implementation details of high-level abstractions.<p>APIs are often uglier with a lot more exposed symbols to handle the parameterization, with various bits and bobs asking for interfaces that only have one concrete implementation that can only be created by a factory, and you have to learn the knack of actually instantiating the useful bits anew for each library. I&#x27;ve got Java squarely in mind, of course, and I&#x27;m convinced better language design can solve the problem with less harm to the software.",1387354140

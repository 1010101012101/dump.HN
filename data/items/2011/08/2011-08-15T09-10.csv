What we've come up with is a means of enabling users to go pretty much password free if they so desire.<p>What we've done is taken the usual email verification/password reset link (something like /keys/65a8c7bc16e759f28d37950664a397d231c552f9) and instead of directing the user to an account setup or password reset page, we use this to authenticate the user and log them into the app. Currently the links expire but I'm toying with extending the length out to a month or more. Users are free to create and use passwords if they prefer.<p>Internally keys are treated like passwords (we use bcrypt) with the exception that a user can have multiple valid keys and keys expire.<p>Weaknesses I can see are - someone who has access to email (physical machine) can log in, will it be a pain to launch an app from an email link (for me, yes, but I've seen users do some very rube goldburgesque things to get to websites). Aside from the physical/email access I think it's probably more secure that the usual users' choice of password",1313400292

They are a huge single point of failure both for getting locked out of accounts and for security breaches.<p>I think passwords are fundamentally broken as a security mechanism, once you take human psychology into consideration. We've spent decades trying to teach people to pick better passwords. That didn't work; people still pick stuff that gets cracked in minutes. And now, as Randall Munroe said, it turns out that the ""better"" passwords we taught people to use are actually very bad. Great, let's spend the next 3 decades teaching people to use long passphrases, and watch that fail too. Then we can start teaching them to stop sharing and reusing passwords (good luck).<p>A security token (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_token"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_token</a>) is a fundamentally better solution to authentication. It's not perfect and it's not a panacea, as the RSA security leak/breach shows. But it's better than a completely broken paradigm. Once these tokens acquire enough compute power to perform challenge-response calculations internally, they will be very safe even at untrusted terminals. They've already become ubiquitous in places that really care about authentication on a large scale (like the military), and they should become ubiquitous everywhere. You can have several of them (one for banking sites, one for social...), to avoid single points of failure. They are reliable, and you know when you've lost one. A leaked password manager password, on the other hand, could have the attacker using your logins for months.<p>A technical solution is preferable to a solution which involves changing human behavior on a massive scale; that is just not going to happen.",1313399330

Sussman's joke languages published in InfoWorld and, later, to several USENET groups. It is a parody of Forth, a stack-based programming language.

  The original description by Sussman is: FIFTH ... FIFTH is a precision mathematical language in which the data types refer to quantity. The data types range from CC, OUNCE, SHOT, and JIGGER to FIFTH (hence the name of the language), LITER, MAGNUM, and BLOTTO. Commands refer to in- gredients such as CHABLIS, CHARDONNAY, CABERNET, GIN, VERMOUTH, VODKA, SCOTCH and WHATEVERSAROUND.

  The many versions of the FIFTH language reflect the sophisti- cation and financial status of its users. Commands in the ELITE dialect include VSOP and LAFITE, while commands in the GUTTER di- alect include HOOTCH and RIPPLE. The latter is a favorite of frustrated FORTH programmers who end up using the language

</code></pre>
However...<p><pre><code>  In the 1980s, Kriya Systems developed and sold an object oriented Forth-like programming language which was initially announced as FIFTH. FIFTH never appeared on the market, but Kriya Systems did launch an object oriented Forth variant, named NEON. FIFTH is also the name of a Forth-based programming environment, described by Cliff Click and Paul Snow at the 1986 Rochester Forth Conference.

Want to create a start-up? Sorry, you're not professional enough to create a start-up, so you're legally banned from doing so.<p>That's what's called a slippery-slope argument. It's also a fallacy. A startup does not have to ask Apple to provide a storefront, distribution network and billing system for them.<p>> How can you hope to speak for all iPhone users? Do you really think that the interests and goals of every single iPhone user align perfectly with no conflicts?<p>By creating a marketplace with a baseline of quality, you improve everybody's bottom line. Developers can spend less effort convincing the customer that their product isn't a buggy piece of crap that won't run, or needs special access to a restricted service, or any of the other things that Apple's review process screens out.<p>Apple is removing barriers-to-purchase for the customers by converting them into barriers-to-entry for the developers. Doing this has made the App Store an impulse-buyer's dream, and this benefits everyone.<p>> We should also make it easier to identify 'professional' programmers from the lowly hobbyists by creating a 'professional programmer' certification program.<p>Perhaps that's coming, too. Despite your sarcasm, a legal profession with Bar exams or medical profession with licenses is still substantially better than one without. Even if, at the very least, they only provide a mechanism for taking consistently poor practitioners out of the system.<p>But that's unlikely, because professional certifications are used when the professional himself is the product. Here, the app is the product, and Apple is screening on the merits of the product.<p>I'm going to guess it's logistically impossible to train so many reviewers to look at each product in detail (with turnover, very high submission rates, etc.), so they have to give them broad rules.<p>Right now, someone is claiming that CS5-compiled Flash games HAVE made it to the App Store, and that they are slow pieces of crap:<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/bpdpo/see_for_yourself_why_flash_was_banned_from_the/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/bpdpo/see_for_yoursel...</a><p>If CS5 unleashes a tidal wave of Flash games into the App store, then yes, I imagine that iPhone owners will be disgusted with the state of the market, hurting everyone trying to sell a product there.

1257160,comment,1256516,1257002,0,0,brandnewlow,,,"I'm a picky eater along these lines though I've gotten better.  It's not a good life.  Here's how it's been for me in the past.<p>Picky eaters are people who use food the way an alcoholic uses booze.  For the picky eater, food's purpose is to help regulate one's emotional state. Picky eaters choose food based on utility, not taste.<p>You can't get a food high off of broccoli, spinach, or asparagus.  You can however get high off potato chips, french fries, pizza, macaroni and cheese, cheeseburgers, and chicken fingers.  Therefore these foods are useful.  Asparagus and friends are not useful.  They don't ping your pleasure sensors.  They do not address the picky eater's problem: some mild to major emotional distress.<p>Many picky eaters don't like their food to touch, and don't like odd ingredients in their dishes because it creates a risk that the food won't deliver the sought after high.<p>Once when visiting my cousins, their mom made macaroni and cheese for lunch.  I got pretty excited when I heard that. However, when I heaved the first spoonful into my mouth and bit down on a piece of onion, my whole body tensed up, my eyes started to water, and I felt myself getting angry.  What had she DONE to my reliable drug?  Basically, I freaked out.  I was 7-8 at the time I think, and yes, I am embarrassed by this story.<p>A picky eater doesn't want carrots to touch his/her mashed potatoes. The contact might ruin the potential potato high, like mixing baking soda in with your cocaine.  When the picky eater puts something on his plate, he puts it there because he knows how it will affect his brain chemistry.  If it touches something else, who knows if it'll still get the job done?<p>When a picky eater goes to a restaurant, they look for things they recognize on the menu and order those.  They do this because their relationship to food is different from the average person. The picky eater is dependent on specific foods that create the food high.  A new dish might fail to create the food high, leaving the picky eater with a serious problem on his/her hands.<p>As a kid I learned that junk food made me feel good while vegetables and stuff like it tasted funny and didn't.  To my kid brain, it seemed logical and efficient to not waste time eating stuff that didn't make me feel good.  So I embarked on a life of ""picky eating,"" aka, not eating vegetables.  This continued through college, where I began experiencing negative social consequences.<p>I've gotten a lot better in the last 4-5 years.  I still can't stand Caesar salad's and anything with iceberg lettuce in it, but quite like leafier, greener ones that aren't so crunchy.  I no longer detest broccoli but appreciate that it kind of tastes like beef if grilled properly.  There are still a lot of vegetables I have a strong aversion to, but I manage to hide it well in social settings.",1271003763

Too much of C++ is held back by its C compatibility requirement, but I will admit I haven't paid attention to it for a few years.  In either case, they very seldom have GC runtimes, and very few interpretive run times for them have been developed.  Scheme had both in 1975 (by virtue of running on top of MACLISP).<p>As I understand it, Objective-C is C with Smalltalk style classes.  Wikipedia says it ""is a thin layer on top of C, and moreover is a <i>strict superset</i> of C.""  A quick skim of the Wikipedia article suggests that it's very much like C++ in how I view this, both are mid-'80s languages that built something on top of C with similar backward compatibility and efficiency design goals (the two are of course linked), including no GC.<p>You can do conservative garbage collection of both and Objective-C 2.0 added it as an official feature (although that's not available on the iPhone version according to Wikipedia).<p>Anyway, all things considered, I don't consider them modern in the way Scheme and Clojure are (Common Lisp got stuck in amber), and I'm pretty sure I'd consider some version of FORTRAN after 1977 more modern than they are.  Certainly higher level, see Fran Allen's flames in <i>Coders at Work</i> for how much the low level nature of C has set us back.<p>C is a good universal assembly language.  C++ is good for certain performance critical applications (VLSI design and simulation were good '80s examples as I understand).  Neither are good for many if not most i<whatever> applications.<p>I can't render an opinion on Objective-C's suitability for these type applications (I only have theoretical knowledge of Smalltalk style objects and know nothing about the whole package), and it's almost certainly the best language under the new restrictions ... but suppose we just defer this until it has a REPL.  (A LISP feature from the very early '60s, after the first punched card FORTRAN subroutine version.  They'd <i>just</i> switched from vacuum tubes to transistors....)<p>That is or was a design goal, but I gather from all the discussion it's not even on the official road map.

1257129,comment,1256516,1256544,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Agreed, it's complete nonsense. Specifically McDonalds is world renowned for having the saltiest fries on the planet, and salt is one of the worlds best preservatives. Frying a food also creates a barrier, the core is heated well beyond the point any microbe is capable of surviving and the natural porosity of the potato is sealed with oil that itself doesn't decompose.<p>Essentially a McDonalds fry is sanitized on the inside, sealed and coated with enough salt that microbes won't develop on the surface. Salt is used in antimicrobial rinses for mouth infections and is regularly recommended by dentists and doctors for oral issues, so somehow a food preservative known and used for as long as human civilization appears to remember is now synonymous with inediblity?<p>The burger again is made with highly salted meat and is fried not grilled, which has the same effect as with the fries. Not to mention protein and fat has a much longer decomposition cycle than carbohydrates.<p>Simply put it isn't anything to do with the edibility of McDonalds foods its a testament to the preservatives used in their main consumables.<p>I'm sorry, there's hardtack in museum pieces that have been fully unpreserved and stored to the open environment for going on a century that would still be edible and fully digestible - and it's mostly carbohydrates!<p>The McDonalds food would not still be suitable for human consumption, if it was the author should have eaten it. The bread doesn't look dehydrated it looks like its probably saturated with penicillium, which likely aided in the preservation of the meat it encases. Again the meat is highly discoloured compared to the original photo (golden brown originally to a near black) and has also shrunk considerably (in the original it is to the edges of the bun, in the new photograph it is considerably smaller than a shrunken bun). The fries also are considerably dehydrated, which again only has a preservative effect.<p>Exceptional use of a combination of preservatives does not mean a food is inedible or non-nutritious.<p>As for their assertion that flies wouldn't touch it, that is likely a combination of two reasons. The first they attest that it had no odor, which is a key navigation system for flies to reach food (like flies to cow shit isn't a saying because cow shit is odorless, you can smell most from half a field away). The second reason is that insects, especially their larvae, are relatively unprotected against the environment and any becoming in contact with the salt would rapidly have succumbed to salt poisoning.<p>If they wanted to argue that nothing other than humans are foolish enough to eat these products then they obviously have never left a city. When virtually every city in England has signs posted everywhere against not feeding the pigeons/seagulls isn't because people are feeding them bread or a nice piece of sirloin steak, no they're being fed fries. Go to any coastal city in England and you'll see entire flocks of seagulls fighting over leftover fries from fish and chip shops. These animals wouldn't be thriving to the order of thousands over inedible and indigestible foods.<p>The author obviously wants to sell a book about nutrition for infants and is trying to do so by arguing that feeding your child a Happy Meal is bad for the health. However a Happy Meal isn't bad for your babies health, it isn't poisonous and it isn't going to kill them, perhaps its not nutritionally the best you can supply for your child but then neither is Kraft Dinner, hot dogs, bacon or any other of a long list of foods that children are routinely given that aren't nutritionally ideal.<p>Excessive quantities of anything is harmful, including supposedly healthy foods. Polyunsaturated fats whilst apparently heart and brain healthy have been linked with marked increases in skin cancer when not consumed in proper quantities (IE when not from eating actual fish). The holy grail like treatment of polyunsaturated fats led directly to a monumental increase in trans fats when it began being used and advertised as a healthier baking/frying medium when the healthiest is actually saturated fat as it is heat stable. Companies are now returning to saturated fats to remove the trans fats that the misguided health Nazis introduced into our diets as being <i>HEALTHY</i> for us. They swapped a fat with a minor link to heart disease with a fat with a major link with heart disease.<p>Simply put: Eat the burger or don't fucking buy it.",1271003113

Rather than go to someone who has actual social skills/management skills/whatever is needed, they then rail about the problem, usually in a way that alienates the very people they want to win over.  My experience so far has been that most such individuals are not interested in constructive feedback on how they could more effectively manage that end of things.  They feel ""wronged"" (or whatever) and telling them that what they are doing is counterproductive just seems to make them defensive.

About 99.99% of the time, you have no control over what other people do but you can exercise some control over your own behavior.

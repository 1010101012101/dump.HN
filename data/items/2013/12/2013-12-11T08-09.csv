6886654,comment,6883611,6884698,2,0,Ygg2,,,"TL;DR. Theory of evolution meets anthropic principle<p>I think you are missing my point as well. Reality IS non-local, we just PERCEIVE it as local. No triangle on Earth surface has sum of angles 180, but we say - well it&#x27;s close enough to 180 so lets say it&#x27;s 180.<p>We perceive causality because it&#x27;s an easier approximation than calculating probability distribution of each molecule. It&#x27;s like a Russian doll, we perceive the outer doll as whole because we don&#x27;t look close enough.<p>Because we don&#x27;t need to. Evolution didn&#x27;t specialize us to notice the subtle effect of quantum reality, when a good enough approximation allows us to survive and thrive. We perceive things we perceive, because of their importance for our survival. True nature of reality isn&#x27;t important to our survival. Thus we don&#x27;t perceive it.<p>Reality requires infinite amount of data to process. So we approximate it to stop being overwhelmed.<p>E.g. geocentric or heliocentric model of solar system are both equally valid. We just choose Heliocentric because its orbits are easier to calculate. Or earth is essentially flat even though it&#x27;s a sphere etc.",1386752331

It&#x27;s, as I said in my original post, a subtle and mostly technical one, so that&#x27;s not unforeseeable.

What Uruguay has done falls in the latter. They didn&#x27;t merely say, &quot;There&#x27;s no penalty for committing this crime.&quot; They didn&#x27;t merely say, &quot;We&#x27;re going to make prosecution of this crime our lowest priority.&quot; They said, &quot;This is not a crime.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s what&#x27;s different here, and it&#x27;s an important, but apparently overlooked distinction that I think needs pointing out.

Even possession of amounts less than one ounce is specifically listed as a crime, albeit not a terribly serious one.<p>The court&#x27;s ruling in <i>Ravin v State</i> does not <i>change</i> the law; it <i>interprets</i> it. The referenced statues may have been added after that ruling, but they have not yet been challenged. As such they are, if only technically, <i>still the law</i>.

There are plenty of obtuse American theorists, and plenty of philosophers whose conception of power and relations is very similar - for example Chomsky has a lot in common with Foucault in examining relations of power and control, and their relationship with language, and is fond of constructing similar thickets of prose. Many writers from James to Joyce to Faulkner also delighted in creating obtuse literature in the &#x27;Anglo-Saxon&#x27; canon.<p>The label Anglo-Saxon is an absurd, racist simplification which undermines your argument. There is no coherent Anglo-Saxon way - except as it exists in the imagination of the French intelligentsia as a foil to their clearly more sophisticated approach.

What do we do with your old posts and comments? Deleting all the data for inactive users seems like an awful approach. If we keep the data, you lost your username, so what&#x27;s displayed beside your comments? Do we just replace your username with the word, <i>inactive</i>? What about your profile? If I come across your old comments, enjoy them, and want to see your profile, I obviously can&#x27;t go to <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=andrewhillman\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=andrewhillman</a> any more, so where is your profile moved to?<p>2. People expect their identity to remain consistent. What happens if you take a season off HN since you&#x27;re busy at school? Meanwhile, you have links to <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=andrewhillman\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=andrewhillman</a> on your linkedin profile, or your website, or maybe you have business cards or flyers printed with that URL. Uh oh, you come back to HN, and that profile now belongs to someone else. All those great contacts you recently made, and gave business cards to, they&#x27;re browsing the HN profile for someone else, believing their opinions are your own.<p>Ok, now printing your HN profile URL is unlikely, but what about your Twitter? Or Facebook? Or Gmail? This could be a disaster if you have hundreds of links to your Twitter account in blog posts and comments around the internet, then you decide to abandon Twitter. Someone else takes the account name, and has a less than stellar reputation. Lots of communities will not allow you to edit posts past a certain date, so you&#x27;re out of luck, and all your old data is asking people to follow you on Twitter, <i>andrewhillman</i>.

6886542,comment,6885321,6886223,2,0,sethrin,,,"In practice police do not pursue charges for marijuana possession unless it&#x27;s bagged for retail. The general idea seems to be, that you can do what you want in the privacy of your home, but smoking marijuana is not socially appropriate.<p>It&#x27;s not actually the law that&#x27;s the problem. We have had ballot measures to legalize the retail of marijuana, and so far the public opinion seems to be against it. I gather that people are more or less happy with the situation as it is.<p>You may be confusing the law for something that actually exists, when in reality, and especially in Alaska, the question is merely what category of offense may provoke an officer to arrest you. I cannot admit to having practical experience growing, buying, and selling marijuana, nor tell of any experience that I have had in conversing with uniformed law enforcement officers about said activities. However, another person of my acquaintance suggests that marijuana use and trafficking is widely tolerated. Another person of more distant acquaintance had the curious story of having had much confiscated growing equipment returned to them out of police custody.<p>It is very important to note that Alaska, being in the northern latitudes, has most of its population in areas which receive less than 5 hours of daylight at the solstice. In humans lack of exposure to daylight is known to produce vitamin D deficiency, which can result in depression among other symptoms, and this disease is both prevalent and largely untreated. This to my mind is the strongest correlating factor, but the fact remains that Alaska has extremely high rates of alcoholism, murder, child and other physical abuse, vehicular accidents, as well as other drug problems.<p>No one is going to call the cops if you&#x27;re smoking a joint, even in public. They will think you&#x27;re an asshole, and being an asshole is often a good way to be arrested. If you are drunk and weaving, and you have a bag in the glove compartment, you will probably be busted for both. If you&#x27;re not going out of your way to bring the fact that you smoke pot into public view, everyone will be okay with that. That may not be <i>your</i> definition of legal, but it is certainly <i>a</i> definition of legal, and as much as you or I might wish it to be otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty hard to argue with the vox populi.",1386749756

6886540,comment,6880474,6886428,2,0,Tomte,,,"Good points.<p>First, I&#x27;m not saying that cryptographic randomness can be created out of thin air, without entropy, I just argue that you don&#x27;t need n bits of real entropy to get n bits of high-quality randomness.<p>I mean if you really needed 4096 bits of random seed to generate 4096 bits on randomness, why not just take the 4096 bits you waste on the seed as randomness?<p>Of course you need a random seed. That&#x27;s what i was alluding to with the boot-time or VM remark.<p>But you&#x27;re not really interested in lots and lots of potential output sequences, one of them is enough. Remember, the first requirement of a block cipher is that it is indistinguishable (to a computational polynomial bound) from a random distribution.<p>The real counter-argument is the state attack. And that&#x27;s mitigated by a modern RNG&#x27;s design. Fortuna, for example, constantly mixes incoming entropy into outputs that occur far in the future (technically, it reseeds every now and then, but without estimating entropy). This does not protect you from a total state compromise, a computer is deterministic, after all, but it&#x27;s quite hard to argue with a straight face that such a total compromise matters, because everything you might want to use the randomness for would most certainly be quite as compromised, as well.<p>So why take that (probably insignificant) risk?<p>Because the alternative is worse. If you want to have Linux&#x27;s current /dev/random behavior, you have two things:<p>First, it blocks when there&#x27;s not enough entropy in the pool. That&#x27;s bad. Just google for &quot;sshd hangs&quot;. Either your system doesn&#x27;t work anymore, or people find creative ways to subterfuge all the crypto stuff to make it work again. Just for the far-fetched fear about this total state compromise?<p>Second, how much entropy do you have? Lots and lots has been written about it, but despite all this technobabble (&quot;&#x27;entropy&#x27;, there must be hard physics behind it&quot;), estimating entropy is not really an exact science. More guesswork. So you never know how much entropy you really have. That&#x27;s why Fortuna got rid of all that estimating that its predecessor Yarrow still did.",1386749752

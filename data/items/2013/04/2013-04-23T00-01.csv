If the people want a language changed, most abuse the current prototype system to be more classic class like (including top notch programmers), and there is a demand for it, why not add a proper class syntax, even as a sugar for the common workaround?<p>It's like saying people must adapt to the idiomatic ways of a language without offering any proof that those are better (and no, random qualities like ""more flexible"" is not necessarily better in actual use).<p>I don't think we should worship ""idiomatic"" ways of each language. For example, tons of Beans, XML, and boilerplate was the idiomatic Java way, but then projects came along and showed it could be done better (e.g Play). Using every feature under the sun and abusing templates is kind of an idiomatic C++ way, but people are arguing successfully for merely using C++ only as a C with classes and some minimal features.",1366678687

New code looks like better code because it is more similar to your current style and preferences, and nearer to you in memory than that old code was.<p>To really analyze whether your code is good or not you must do what you did with that self-identified bad code: step away for months, forget everything about it, and re-visit it to modify it in some way.

Never written much JavaScript myself, but as an Objective-C / iOS developer I understand the delegation part well, as it's an integral part of Apple's UIKit and AppKit API's. Though the concept was kind of alien to me before I started writing Objective-C code.<p>A few years ago, when I started learning Objective-C I used a book written by Aaron Hillegass. I liked the way he explained delegation vs. subclassing:<p>> Once upon a time (before Baywatch) there was a man with no name. Knight Industries decided that if this man were given guns and wheels and booster rockets, he would be the perfect crime-fighting tool. First they thought, ""Let's subclass him and override everything we need to add the guns and wheels and booster rockets."" The problem was to subclass Michael Knight, you would need to know an awful lot about his guts so that you could wire them to guns and booster rockets. So instead they created a helper object (delegate), the Knight Industries 2000 Super Car, or ""Kitt.""<p>> Notice how this is different from the RoboCop approach. RoboCop was a man subclassed and extended. The whole RoboCop project involved dozens of surgeons to extend the man's brain into a fighting machine. This is the approach taken by many object-oriented frameworks.<p>Source: Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X by Aaron Hillegass.",1366678023

bandwidth was too small for sending pictures
of people easily.<p>(2) I was trying to develop on OS/2, which
seemed to be more advanced than Windows in
1995, but there the infrastructure for building
such a Web site was still very poor.<p>(3) For storing photographs of people, hard 
disk prices were still too high.<p>(4) I was highly concerned about privacy,
e.g., concerned that some pretty woman 
would have her picture and information 
on the site, and some wacko would download
all that info, print it out, and put it
up on trees, lamp posts, doors, walls, 
in men's rooms, etc.<p>(5) Believed that, still, really needed
a walk-in local office, as was common 
at the time.  That is, could not expect
that could do it all with just a Web 
site.  In the local office wanted an
environment for couples to be introduced
that would be safe for the woman.<p>(6) At the time, the matchmaking industry
was moving from data on paper in books 
to video clips in VCR cassettes to be
viewed in a walk-in local office.  I 
wanted to have the video clips in 
digital form that could be viewed 
on computers in the office, but then
the conversion of video from analog
to video took way too much computing
power, and the disk space cost was
way too high.  Also the operating
systems didn't supply easy means of
working with digital video.<p>(7) Was concerned about how to keep
up the image and reputation of the
company that it was for serious
romantic matchmaking, e.g., looking
for a spouse, and not for another
version of pimps and prostitutes.<p>So, I gave it up.<p>Lesson 1:  A lot of those 'social'
concerns in the end people don't 
much care about.<p>Lesson 2:  The infrastructure was not
ready, and developing it just for that
project would have been way too 
expensive.  E.g., Firewire was just
getting started; there was a prototype
card for a few thousand dollars; there 
was no device driver software.<p>But all the infrastructure
did become ready, solid, and very 
cheap but for much more general
purposes than just romantic matchmaking.
So, even if the needed general infrastructure
is possible, likely can't afford to develop
it just for one, narrow purpose but likely
can get it for free if just wait until
it gets developed for larger considerations.<p>Lesson 3:  The project just needed to wait
5-10 years.",1366677590

I'm not trying to prove that I do, take my word for whatever it's worth to you. In equities I've derived it from the Graham-Dodd-Buffett approach. I've found it exceptionally easy to spot when to short stocks by reversing the Graham Dodd approach (it works for spotting undervalued equities, and it works equally for spotting overvalued equities, I just happen to be good at that side of it).<p>On the technology side, if you understand Apple's business model, and you understand how technology markets work toward consolidation around standards, and then you apply the context of what Android is and its vendors / support / ecosystem (and whether it's of high enough quality to be good enough for that 80% to 90% of consumers, to rule ala Windows) - the rest is obvious, it lays out a momentum line that can't be stopped.<p>There are exceptionally painful consequences to Apple losing market share that very few are pricing into things. The mistake I see often is linear thinking on market share to profits; eg if Apple is making $30 billion on 20% market share, said people then think Apple could make $15 billion on 10% market share (when in fact there are numerous destructive penalties for falling below thresholds in the market, regarding developers / apps, music, media, consumer perception, negotiating position with suppliers, stock price falling and losing key employees and on and on).",1366676615

It's exactly this secret keeping that emboldens governments to violate international law, commit acts of war and so on in secret.  If it had to be public knowledge that our government is about to commit an act of war against a country with nukes they might be stopped from doing so.",1339487965

Those codecs, for instance, are a click away in Ubuntu (either at install time or in Software Center).<p>That being said, I prefer Unity to any of the DE in Mint. Plus there's HUD and I'm going to assume all the other stuff Canonical is going to put out soon. I'm one of those people REALLY looking forward to being able to buy an Ubuntu for Android phone. I mean REALLY looking forward to it. In that case, I'll like the consistency of Ubuntu everywhere (Perhaps we'll see a TV soon with Ubuntu TV on it...that would be sweet. etc.).<p>Nothing against Mint.

It seems that the quieter you get your environment - the more bothered you can become.   I've a pretty decent asus gfx card that remains unused, because it has an onboard fan.  Both my desktop and laptop are whisper quiet.<p>I had a friend with a Pentium 4 machine, that he just kept in a nearby cupboard.   Once shut behind the door, you couldn't hear it at all.  If I was a home owner (and could modify my house at will,) I'd probably just place my PC in another room (preferably a store), and channel cables through the wall.  Would be cheaper than wasting money on over-priced cooling.  The good thing about this, is that you also don't have to worry so much about what your PC looks like.

4099358,comment,4097613,4098480,2,0,tallanvor,,,"Amazon probably isn't paying 15 cents/megabyte in the US.  But they're probably paying significantly more outside the US.  They've figured out the average cost per megabyte and probably added on a few cents.  This way the author is getting charged something in the neighborhood of $2.70 to deliver each book rather than being charged $0.50 for some and $15 for others depending on where the purchaser happens to be.  Also keep in mind that Amazon lets you download purchases again at a later time via 3G, so they're probably factoring variable delivery costs based on the number of times people are normally downloading the books.<p>Amazon also has a pretty good track record at lowering costs when their costs go down (at least when looking at AWS), so it wouldn't surprise me to see the delivery fees dropping over time as they negotiate better deals with AT&T or if they start working directly with other mobile operators in other countries.",1339487835

And if it's for both, simplify. Pick one, or maybe have separate pitches (like BuySellAds.com has for advertisers and publishers). Readers are interested in ranking and finding great content (what HN does), writers are interested maybe in stats, spreading their content publishing equally over time and across multiple social platforms.<p>You probably want to stick with the readers pitch since there are specialized tools for writers that have already significant features which are doing all of the above. For the readers pitch, don't promote too much ""statistics"", no content consumer wants to deal with statistics, they just want ranking that magically works. If you still want to mention the word, the best you can do is a pitch which tells people they don't have to deal with it (""magic ranking based on insightful analytic statistics that work for you transparently in the background"").",1339486407

Chromi would be at an evolutionary disadvantage in the gut. This is because the E.

4099213,comment,4098470,4098470,20,0,edanm,,,"Any article that talks about tricks in Sublime Text 2 without mentioning Multiple Cursors is... lacking (no offense to the OP).<p>For anyone that doesn't know it, Multiple Cursors is the ONE BRILLIANT FEATURE that Sublime Text has. Don't get me wrong, tt's great in many other ways too, but Multiple Cursors is, IMO, a feature that should become part of every friggin' text editor in existence, it's that important. And it only exists in Sublime Text.<p>It gives you multiple cursors at seperate places in your document. Each one acts completely independently, moving around with your commands. Everything works as expected, including copy-pasting (it will match the copy-pastes up to your cursors).<p>Most text editors have a column-select mode, except that Multiple Cursors are the same thing on steroids:<p>1. The selections don't have to be contiguous. So if you have a bunch of:<p><div><p><pre><code>  <p> Text And more Text</p>\n\n  <p> Something </p>\n</code></pre>\n</div><p>You can put the cursor only on the <p>s.<p>2. Since each cursor acts independently, you can do operations that you simply can't do in column mode. For example, place the cursor on each <p>, select to the end of that </p>, and delete the text. This is even if the contents of the </p> are completely different.<p>3. Multi Cursor gives the same power as macros, but: They're visual! You see all the changes you're making in realtime. Any long-time vim user has probably recorded a macro, tried playing it back, and discovered that it didn't work. Well, with Multi Cursors, you see the cursor and changes in real-time. Make a wrong command? Undo it instantly.<p>Want an example of another actual use case? I used to have a plugin for Sublime Text that let me split a selection into multiple selections, based on a character. So, let's say I had this code:<p>foo(int a, char b, char c)<p>I could select the paramater list, run my shortcut to split by "","", then I'd get a different selection on each paramater. Then, I could simply multi-select three lines below it inside the actual function, paste, and I've got this code:<p>foo(int a, char b, char c)<p><pre><code>  int a\n\n  char b\n\n  char c\n</code></pre>\nA dead-simple editing task I do 300 times a day.<p>Another example? Let's say I have two ""if"" blocks in the top of a function:<p>if (somecondition):<p><pre><code>  return\n</code></pre>\nif (anothercondition):<p><pre><code>  return\n</code></pre>\nNow, let's say for a second that I just realized I don't want to return, I want to do some processing, then return. This happens a few times a day for me. I just multi-select both ""if""s, hit enter, and add the code. If it's two functions and I need to use the function names, I can even go back, copy the function name, and paste it as part of the processing!!<p>Phew. If it seems I'm a fanboy for Multiple Cursors, I totally am. It's a brilliant tool that only exists in Sublime Text. I've unfortunately gone back to Vim, and am too far in Vim's world to manage working in Sublime Text, which is why I miss multiple cursors so much!<p>But I AM working on a Vim plugin that gives Vim Multiple-Cursors. Been working on it for a while, but I think I'm getting near a more-or-less stable version. Hopefully, it will be released soon.<p></way-too-long-rant>",1339484694

Though I still don't believe a hard problem justifies those sale prices.<p>R&D is expensive but what % of the pharma company income goes to it? Let's take the largest one Pfizer: ~9 billion total out of 67 billion income in FY11.<p>Even for medical expenses it's not that much of a COST. A Top of the line MRI machine costs 1 to 3 mil Usd. Let's say a hospital scans 5 to 10 people a day. The machine pays itself in 2 to 4 months at that 3K pricepoint.<p>Drugs also don't have to be made in the US and go through the whole FDA loop jumping.<p>What I'm saying is pricing seem very wrong to me. There's people with deseases all around the world and supply of drugs is being limited to a very slim percentage of people from 1st world countries due to pricing, because there's people willing to pay those price. Maybe if these cheap drugs companies get to be some sort of ""the walmart of pharmaceuticals"".

Lawyers become friends of their clients and this prevents the clients from easily doing something that isn't in the best interest of the lawyer.  Large ticket salesmen frequently wine and dine clients (including sports tickets and if you believe some accounts prostitutes). Specialty doctors entertain primary care physicians (well at least in the old days they did) in order to maintain a flow of patients. The very clear intent of all of that is to protect a legacy system and prevent you from entering into a relationship with another entity that may actually be better for you.

And even after you spend hours getting these estimates and negotiating fees and payment schedules, these have absolutely <i>no</i> bearing on what you'll ultimately be billed.  Nor will the various legally-distinct parts of the ER necessarily be clued in or included in your discussions.<p>And ERs and ambulatory care centers <i>will</i> turn you away if you can't pay, up until you are delivered by an ambulance (or in that kind of state).<p>And, yes, HMOs and the like are a wild improvement over that.  You may have crappy care with piles of restrictions, but the starting point for your fees will be far lower than if you were on your own.  And the plans' coverage will spare you from hospitals pushing expensive services when cheaper ones will do.  And it will spare you from other hospital shenanigans, like the $40 over-the-counter aspirin. The $200 saline when a gatorade will do, the procedures that were never performed, the ambulance rides you never took, etc.<p>And you will receive 1 bill.  And have 1 company to deal with to pay it. And whatever you work out with that company <i>will</i> be binding on the entire event.  There will be no surprise follow-up bills from parts of the hospital that you didn't even know you received a service from. (And you legitimately may not have)<p>My parents were self-employed when I was growing up.  I've had health coverage on and off over the years.  I know of what I speak.  Not from a one-off event in a relatively healthy youth.  But from 30 years of experience seeing an entire family having to deal with health care.  And let me assure you, that the billing shenanigans are the rule. Fee-for-service has warped the practice of medicine and the uninsured feel the pain disproportionately.<p>Also: what do you think insurance company healthcare is, if not run on a budget? It all is. Even your hypothetical 'the best i can afford' care.  Up until you reach a budget of tens of millions of dollars.<p>And you'll always be able to get better care if you pay more.  That's true if you're uninsured, if you bought your own care, if your employer pays your coverage, or if you get coverage from your government.  The UK has higher levels of care available. As does Canada.  As does Australia.<p>Why do you assume that correcting the problems in our healthcare system and providing everyone with a sane base level of care remove any incentive to get better care?  Are you suggesting that for-profit healthcare will evaporate in a single payer system in America, despite that having never happened in any other country with a single-payer system?",1336421291

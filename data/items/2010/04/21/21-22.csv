I will at least take a look at Adobe Air.<p>Edit: The article says that all major companies Apple, Google, MS, Adobe try to lock in customers. One thing i find positive about Adobe nowadays is, that it seems to be the only Company to bring different platforms together. Except for HTML/JS, i don't know how i would write apps/games for the variety of platforms.\nxmlvm.org comes to my mind, too.

There are two reasons why I say that.  (1) Your knowledge of the AV industry is outdated.  McAfee has actually been trending upwards in recent years. (2) A 97% detection rate is obviously bullshit. If any product achieved a detection rate anywhere close to that number, the false positive count would be through the roof.  As this incident makes clear, the cost of a false positive can be astronomically high.  Again, any AV product advertising or claiming 97% detection is bullshit. Any AV engine can achieve that number if accepts an unrealistic number of false positives. The fact that you even quoted that number makes me question your qualifications for giving advice about AV.<p>For non technical people reading this thread, the general sentiment of other commentators is correct.  Most AV is garbage. It will protect you from about a 1/3 of what is out there at the cost of computer performance.  Make an educated decision about whether to run it at home or not.

There's also non-trivial C++ and Lisp integration, replacing Lisp FFI with Java JNI in some of these cases might not even work _at all_. ITA also <i>does</i> use Java, so Java integration is already there, to plug into Google's front/middle tier.<p>I imagine data persistence and distributed workloads are handled by the C++ portion of ITA code, which means plugging into GFS, BigTable, Chubby and more wouldn't be that difficult. ITA had already done the hard job of working around Common Lisp's missing pieces (a standard on concurrency and systems/network programming), something which would have been a huge distraction to e.g., Google in 2001 (when Ron Garrett attempted to evangelize Lisp).<p>Lastly, ITA isn't dependent on an acquisition by Google in the same way a start-up with no revenue (being acquired for talent and/or audience) would be. They're being bought <i>partly</i> for talent, but also they're being bought for actual technology and a working, profitable business. That gives them a lot more leverage in setting the terms of the acquisition (has e.g., Postini undergone a full re-write?). \nThese issues is what ""technical due diligence"" is supposed to work out and resolve: would an integration necessarily mean driving the employees away? If this is so and such integration would <i>have to</i> occur, then the merger may simply not happen.<p>Even in the case of a pure talent acquisition care has to be taken to avoid an exodus. Money isn't going to the deciding factor here: I'd imagine ITA employees are less bound by golden handcuffs; they're not staring at life changing sums of money and (like most hackers) are more motivated by doing interesting work with smart peers and powerful tools, than by what is effectively a equivalent to a yearly bonus (I am assuming they're likely looking at $100,000-$200,000 in shares vesting over a four year period).",1271884621

Even more interesting is the response it raised with our local HN deniers who seem more interested in discrediting global warming and climate change than in building our understanding of the current state and the climate.  They are the moral equivalent, in my opinion, of the folks who dispute evolution.<p>The denier culture is sociologically interesting.  Those interested in the process should a look at John Mashey's report<p>The current(185-page) PDF, has a much higher production quality and a lot  more information on funding and activity patterns than earlier versions.  The current version is at:<p><a href=""http://www.desmogblog.com/crescendo-climategate-cacophony"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.desmogblog.com/crescendo-climategate-cacophony</a>\nJohn suggests that you read the first 4 pages, and, then, if you want to read more, do the following:<p>a)      Print pages 2-4, the navigational aids<p>b)      Download the full PDF, and for on-screen reading, open a second window (Acrobat: Window>new).  Use one window to read the mainline narrative, and the second for rummaging the Appendices.  Different people are familiar with different subsets, so I know of no way to linearize it that makes sense.<p>A few highlights:<p>p.167-168 on plagiarism:<p>Not just the tree-rings, but a  big chunk of the “social network” part of the Wegman Report seems plagiarized from the Wasserman and Faust(1994) textbook.

Someone with subpoena power could find out more, as there are many potential funding routes.<p>For amusement, see Fig A.3.1 p.50  “What’s in a Name?”  to see how often names like “Institute” and “Science” pop up in entities that basically do PR and lobbying, despite mostly being tax-free 501(c)3s.  I  don’t know the (murky) 501(c)3 law enough to understand whether the amount of lobbying they do is OK or not …<p>However, here’s an interesting GoogleMap:<p><a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?hl=en&ie=UTF8&msa=0&msid=107940825189517771981.0004815492d08b0c445f9&ll=38.882481,-76.978455&spn=0.771829,1.253815&z=10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?hl=en&ie=UTF8&msa=0&#...</a><p>Hint: zoom in and see how many of these are located within one block of a Washington’s K Street.

I’d guess someone might do some more social  network analysis.<p>At point, I was going to do PeopleXpeople … but in that group, no one was more than 1 hop away<p>The attacks on the hockey stick (which could also be called A.Mann) are now split:<p>A.Hockey is the 2002-current   visible use of attacks on the hockey stick as a pillar of climate anti-science, basically used by almost everybody in Figure A.6.2(a).<p>A.HOCKX is  my label for the 1998-2006 effort culminating in the Wegman Report, much of which was behind the scenes.<p>That’s the part that may well be investigated for 18USC1001 (misleading Congress) and 18USC371 (conspiracy) as per A.14, Possible Legal issues, p.184.",1271884169

What motivation would Adobe have to Adopt these features in CS5?  How long would it take Adobe to adopt these features (if at all)?  What if Adobe instead wanted to create their own ""XBOX Live"" system?  Apple would be at the whim of the business interest of the meta-platform, much like they are with Flash on OSX.<p>After all, Flash devs are going to stay Flash devs, they're not going to port everything to Obj-C just to get one or two features on one platform they're deploying on, they're going to stick with what their meta-platform provides.  Apple knows this and they don't want to be stuck the hoping meta-platform want's to move at the same pace they do.<p>Thats what Apple is talking about when they say these cross-platform apps suck, and if you look at the big ones out there for the desktop (eg, Eclipse, Firefox), they're right, those apps don't take advantage of the OSX features (CoreData, CoreAnimation, GrandCentral), they take advantage of the meta-platform features.",1271883796

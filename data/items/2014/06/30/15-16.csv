Unfortunately, it just takes a long time to build an excellent credit rating. One ding you&#x27;ll likely see on every report you pull will be something saying you haven&#x27;t had credit very long. After about the five year mark, this starts to disappear.<p>Once again... caps for emphasis - PAY EVERYTHING ON TIME. A year of great payment history can be erased by a few late/missing payments. Keep good track of when bills are due and set up auto-payment if possible to ensure payment. But also watch those accounts like a hawk as even auto-pay is not a guarantee.",1404143993

If you were to take a 3 lane road that is at 70% capacity and make it 6 lanes I very highly doubt you would get a 6 lane road at 70% capacity.

If an institutional investor (e.g. a pension fund) were to announce to the world &quot;We are going to sell a shitload of Apple shares tomorrow!&quot;, the Apple share price would fall, as everyone front-ran the trade. That would result in a lower price for the pension fund when it actually got around to selling its shares. Regulators actually recognise the advantages in reducing market impact and they specifically allow delays in reporting large, off-exchange trades between clients and broker-dealers to the market for that reason.<p>Dark pools were conceived of as a mechanism to allow institutional investors to trade off-exchange (in theory, with one another), so that they didn&#x27;t have to post bid orders publicly on the &quot;lit&quot; exchange. The reason they&#x27;re called &quot;dark pools&quot; is because you can&#x27;t see the order book, so you don&#x27;t get to see big orders being added to the book (and take advantage of the knowledge that someone&#x27;s just placed a big order, to front-run them). In other words, you don&#x27;t know how deep the pool (i.e. the liquidity on the order book) is - just like you can&#x27;t see how deep a dark pool of water is.<p>As someone who works in financial markets, it&#x27;s weirdly fascinating to watch terms like &quot;dark pools&quot; and HFT end up being used as epithets, almost, by the media.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like how the word &quot;hacker&quot; came to be regarded by many as describing a computer criminal.",1404143252

The single most important thing about Go is it&#x27;s simplicity:<p>For me it is a language that feels like a hybrid between a scripting language and a &#x27;real&#x27; programming language. Simple syntax with some powerful, easy to use features, impressive library support for being only a few years old, but compiles (static) to native code.<p>That fills a gap that Haskell and Rust don&#x27;t, These more advanced languages sacrifice simplicity for an attempt to be perfect. Go makes the clear statement of being simple above everything else.<p>Give an average python/ruby/<insert scripting language here> coder the link to &quot;A 30-minute Introduction to Rust&quot; ( <a href=""http://doc.rust-lang.org/intro.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.rust-lang.org/intro.html</a> ), and he/she will give you a strange look and not understand half of what is being said there.

Give it to a C++ coder and he&#x27;ll say &#x27;oh nice, but I can do that in C++, use Boost<whatever>, because C++ is superior to all!&#x27; - and that coder there is their target audience. A decent C++ coder will have invested too much time to learn another language to solve problems he already learned to solve for himself in C++ a long time ago. Rust might be better and would make his life easier in a lot of cases, but still the majority won&#x27;t make the switch.<p>Give the same <insert scripting language here> coder the Go documentation, and he&#x27;ll be off in no time, writing better code than he used to do, producing a single binary which will not be an absolute nightmare to deploy. And that&#x27;s what every coder of scripting languages has always dreamed of - being able to make programs in a simple straight-forward way, with as little dependencies as possible, without needing a <language X> runtime. On top of that, Go makes cross-compilation dead-easy.<p>There are a LOT more <insert scripting language here> coders out-there than there are C++ programmers.

We actually tested that 8+ years ago and although I don&#x27;t recall the exact numbers, sending the password lead to much higher login rates than creating a new password.

I&#x27;m sure that other services have popped up to take it&#x27;s place and that it&#x27;s popularity is dropping, but I really find it hard to believe that they are Youtube (completely different service), Blogger (Which up until now I was under the impression that Google had forgotten that it even owned) and Google+ (More recent and less established than Orkut, and still a small amount of active users).<p>Google didn&#x27;t say that YouTube, Blogger, or Google+ have taken Orkut&#x27;s place. Google said that YouTube, Blogger, and Google+ have outpaced Orkut&#x27;s growth and are, largely as a result of that, more appropriate focuses of Google&#x27;s resources.<p>> I&#x27;m thinking more that non-Google services are the real threats<p>This isn&#x27;t about &quot;threats&quot;, its about opportunities -- more specifically, its about where Google effort has the best returns for Google.",1404140448

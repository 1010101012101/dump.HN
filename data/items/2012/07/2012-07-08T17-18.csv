The functional retrogames series of posts (starts at <a href=""http://prog21.dadgum.com/23.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prog21.dadgum.com/23.html</a> ) summed up the issue well I think,<p><i>When I first mused over writing a game in a purely functional style, this had me stymied. One simple function ends up possibly changing the entire state of the world? Should that function take the whole world as input and return a brand new world as output? Why even use functional programming, then?</i>",1341770223
4215126,comment,4214800,4214886,3,0,planckscnst,,,"Awesome's ""tile"" layouts can do a whole lot - enough that I only ever use tile and max.<p>The tile layouts have a primary area and a secondary area. There are four different tile layouts with the primary area either on the left, right, top, or bottom. Once you pick one of those, you can control how many windows are in the primary area - the rest fill the secondary area. You can split the secondary area into divisions and increase or decrease the number of divisions; it will fill each division with windows in a round-robin style, placing the new window in the primary area - if the primary area is full, the oldest window gets pushed into the secondary area.<p>Of course, if you open a window and specifically want to move it to the secondary area, it's as simple as giving focus to that window and moving it down the stack.<p>This might sound complicated, but the keybindings are quite natural once you learn them (kind of like vim). All the window manager shortcuts start with the [mod4] (""windows"") key. It's that with j/k to cycle up and down the stack, add [shift] to shift the position of the window in the stack. It's the [mod4] key with h/l to increase/decrease the size of the primary area; add [shift] to that to increase/decrease the number of windows in the primary area or [ctrl] to increase/decrease the number of subdivisions (I remember ""C""ontrol ""C""olumn, even though it's not columns if you're using a layout with the primary on the top or bottom).<p>You might wonder how one could use tile mode for everything: what if you're coding away (which usually involves several terminals open), then you need to open gitk - one of those tiny panes is way too small! Well, you don't need to change the whole layout for that; you can toggle properties on individual windows to add either fullscreen [mod4]+f, maximized [mod4]+m, or floating [mod4]+[ctrl]+[space].",1341770222

It's not an application as you suggest, and the author doesn't suggest it's a good idea for applications, either.<p>The conclusion isn't ""use Haskell & never test your code!"". After all, he explicitly offers no conclusion. :) It's just an example of how, sometimes, you can be reasonably certain that your Haskell program is correct when it compiles.<p>Myself, I'd still run it, or at least QuickCheck it.

Clients want to make sure that they can feel secure in your ability to accomplish the task properly, and they want to feel like they will not be ripped off.<p>As someone who has hired contractors before, I can tell you what makes me feel comfortable. One is to hear specifics about how the contractor has experience with the specific technologies I use. If I am using Python/Django and the contractor mentions experience with that, then I know he or she read my specification and has the particular types of qualification that I need. I also like it when contractors have some open source work they can point to, since that gives me an example of their work and also makes me feel that they are active and interested in their field.<p>Not everyone on freelancing sites is choosing the cheapest bid. It might be worth it to you to give it a try even if you take a few less than ideal projects to begin with, just to build up a portfolio and a job history.<p>Also (and I know this view isn't super popular on HN), I like working with a new contractor on a fixed-price payment plan. If they are willing to do that, to me it indicates that they have confidence in their ability to complete the task promptly, and I don't risk that a bad contractor will drag the project out and cost me lots of money. Perhaps that would help you reassure clients that you are capable before they have had the chance to work with you, at least until you have a strong portfolio to demonstrate your skills.

Your comment about hunger strikes underscores my point. <i>It is completely inappropriate for any citizen of the modern US to express any indignation about the democratic process going on in another country.</i><p>In the US we are given a standard explanation about other countries:  Women are mistreated there, children and the poor are victims, governments there are corrupt and ineffective, sectarian or criminal gangs run things, etc.  We as enlightened Americans are supposed to feel indignant, and we're supposed to support bold action that will free the people in question from their oppressive circumstances, since the people themselves are too dis-empowered to do it for themselves, too clueless to realize they should, etc.<p>The author's story was strongly influenced by this kind of explanation, right down to the indignation he ever-so-confidently expresses.<p>This is why I mentioned a few aspects of American society that ought to put things into perspective a bit.  If someone is drawn to indignation and feels inspired to allow his life to be motivated by its sharp pangs, he should look closely at  the environment he knows most about -- his own city or possibly his own country.<p>The narrative/explanation above is used to promote meddling in other countries and is a hallmark of neoconservative thought.

It's not like I just twiddle stuff until it compiles. I look at it and say, ""Duh! That was dumb of me!"" It's like using Unit Analysis working out a long physics problem... errors in your thinking about it are very likely to show up in unit analysis.

It is an experience that will kill you, and leave you discovering life  discovering you.
Take your senses on a ride with its varied geographies that will raise you - with the tranquility to numb your
thoughts - above the highest Himalayas and send you dipping to the complex of seas - angry some and
transparent the others  not before it coats a layer of earth with the never ending plains on your humility and
etches the burns of beauty on its deserts delving into the east so green as though you have travelled through
the womb of nature.
And all that changes the way your body smells, your senses perceive, your brain thinks.
The sheer variety of a cocktail of experiences that is shoved towards you  from the dead stone caves of the
Deccan to the fragrances of spice bazaars fighting among themselves, from the historical makeup of its
traditions to the coexistence of its diversity layered with the shine of modernity all glued together by the
religious cores of its life, from chaotic noises of it populated cities to places pure virgin, unexplored, from the
finest of luxuries that the world has to offer to the free meals of a temple, from the complexity of languages to
the simplicity of the hearts of its people  jostles your entire being.
You learn that taste of food is not by its ingredients but by the hand that cooks it, that vivacity of culture is not in
the art but in the artist that practices it, that the law of the land in not by civilization but by the embedded
civilization, that modernity is not evolved from the old but that new is just a function of time and that time has
varying speeds & that it can even stand still or fly by - that relationships do not necessarily need people to know
each other.
You may spend all your money but might not be able even cover Indias peripheries or you may travel all of India
for almost no money. You may be astonished by the dynamics of families; be warned - strangers may seem too
eager to help. You may follow the trails of most ancient of religions or you may stroll through shiny city culture.
India doesnt need a preparation. Indian accepts you as you are.
Sometimes India will scare you. Sometimes India will confuse you. Sometimes it will demand patience and
sometimes it will test your sense-of-humor. Other times, all of it would get so overwhelming that you would
want it all to just stop. And yet there will be times when you will let the experience flow through you.
Most people come to India in search of peace, some inner philosophy or finding religion. You will be escorted to
the most tranquilizing places on this planet, to the most psychedelic aura that the nature has to offer and to the
most comprehensive of eastern philosophies. But that will not quench you. And then, in the busiest of the
moments, amongst the crowded of places, you may discover it.
Leaving India, it may not be certain that you will have your answers but it can be assured that you will be at
peace  with yourself.
Incredible. Absolutely unforgettable.",1341768855

I hope everyone will forgive me for the following aside, as it has little to do with the OP:<p>Despite what PG and others think, there is a difference between troll and differing opinion. Unfortunately, since I buck authority and general consensus, I've lived in the shadows here ever since I was devmonk, a user that rose quickly in status, and then quit HN (changed password to something I could never retype and logged-out) when I realized I was addicted to it when someone else did the same thing. Unfortunately for me, PG, and HN, I can't stay away. I've written under so many different usernames and every time now I don't use a password I could ever retype, that way when I get tired of it, I logout never to login under that again. I like the community here and like to contribute. I would rather just post anonymously though. I think that any good system that relies on experience to promote thought can benefit from analytic criticism of some sort as long as any offense it causes is not permanently or long-wounding and does not limit beliefs or freedom. YC and PG unfortunately promote a sort of discussion that is slightly too limited. Reddit, Slashdot, and others are there for the ""others"", and HN for them is a place to act as an online part of YC that provides a way for ""hackers"" (though I hate the use of the term, as it invented it's own definition of ""hacker"") to share links, news, and science and discuss tech startups, SAAS apps, and ideas about tech startup entrepreneurship. That is fine, but what's also good is letting discussions manage themselves organically without axing dissenting opinion. In fact, the times that I've brought up how PG manages dissenting users, that gets shot down, too. Ok- maybe to some extent that is acceptable, to some extent, but a better way to handle it is by laying it out and saying each time, ""I am making it harder on you to post by doing X because of Y.""

My degree is a double major in CS / math</i><p>My deepest sympathies about your job search. The ""double major in computer science and mathematics"" part of what you wrote sounds scary, as I have a large circle of acquaintance among young people who are pursuing similar studies. I don't have comprehensive information about how the general mass of such students is doing, but I'll relate a few anecdotes that may suggest some paths forward for you.<p>Anecdote 1, a scary anecdote: A few years ago, that is BEFORE the financial system crash threw the world into recession, I had occasion to meet a young man who had been on his state's all-state mathematics team to compete in the ARML contest<p><a href=""http://www.arml.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arml.com/</a><p>during high school. Rather than stay in-state for his computer science degree, he went to another state to attend its state university (presumably on financial grounds). The other state's state university is a Big Ten university that ought to have a decent reputation for its computer science department. But as I met this young man, he was four or five months out of college, and living in his parent's basement while still looking for work.<p>Anecdote 2, a lot less scary: Another young person I know, nineteen years old (barely) just now, accelerated his high school studies by doing two years of dual enrollment (college studies as part of his high school program) with a grade skip or two thrown in besides. He did not participate in any formal mathematics competition programs. He then transfered to our state university as an advanced standing undergraduate, and finished up an undergraduate degree in computer science (with a few but not a lot of elective courses in mathematics beyond the computer science major requirements) before he was eighteen years old. Since he turned eighteen, he has been out on the west coast, and is now in Silicon Valley, telling many of his friends that there are a LOT of jobs for anyone who is a decent programmer. He programs for fun and has apparently always done well in his school programming assignments and in technical interviews. He is convinced that anyone who can get through a technical interview with coding work-sample testing can find a good job in Silicon Valley.<p>Anecdotes 3-5: I know several other young people who got various summer internships during various phases of their recent undergraduate studies in computer science at various universities, and once they made a good impression on one company by their work in the internship, they started looking around at other possibilities around the country. All of the better job opportunities seem to use the research-based process of work sample tests as part of hiring. One young person I know who is in the job search phase just now while wrapping up a summer internship has had full-day technical interviews with multiple work-sample tests and discussion of each phase of the work samples after each test. It's gratifying to hear that some of the young people I know are getting to the second interview phase at multiple companies and some others have started career jobs at Google (if that's the kind of job they like) or at brand-new startups (if that is what they like).<p>The crucial thing seems to be being able to do on the spot what industry jobs expect programmers to do. In the extreme case, people who can do that who haven't finished their college degree programs seem to be able to find career jobs. It doesn't sound like the degree as such is really the crucial hiring criterion in most places.<p><i>Is it, in your opinion, possible to have decent software development skills without years of experience under your belt? Do you meet many such people?</i><p>It is possible to have strong development skills without years of full-time employment in career industry jobs if one does the right kind of recreational reading and takes on challenging programming tasks ""for fun."" I know a few such people. For them, where they went to college, what they majored in during college, and whether or not they finished college seem to be almost incidental details about their biographies.<p>Good luck in your job search!",1341767941

4215012,comment,4212680,4212680,4,0,paisible,,,"A few months ago, I started a projet with a few friends, whereby we commit to each writing and recording one original song per week, then meet on thursday to listen to everyone's creations and critique. As far as I am concerned, this experience persuaded me that taking more time does certainly not equate producing higher quality material ; up until now, I had taken months and sometimes years (!!) to finish and sometimes never end up recording songs, always unhappy with the final result, and with no deadline, unable to simply let go of my ego and release.
The goal with la Chanson Du Jeudi (www.lachansondujeudi.com) was to adopt a more ""Bob Dylan"" approach, ie : do one-take recordings if that's all we had time for (none of us are professional musicians in any capacity), and respect the act of creation above that of perfecting.  In most cases, we'd end up writing, composing and recording the night before or day of, which led us to go down creative paths that would otherwise maybe have been discarded. 
Interestingly, I was talking with a friend last night who is applying pretty the same concept to picture-taking : a group of friends decide on a topic, and submit pictures every week to a Flickr channel and vote on them. Much like the need to produce songs on a regular basis forced me to start recording any little idea that came to me to be sure I had something to close the week, she now consciously takes her camera everywhere she goes for this project's purpose.",1341767585

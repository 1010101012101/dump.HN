6861006,comment,6858402,6859625,1,0,terminal,,,"I think sales are being approached in a good way, especially by my partners. I started contacting prospective clients by myself and got about 15% to 20% fast and positive responses to cold-emailing, which I&#x27;m told is a very good figure. But having those &quot;hot&quot; leads test my SaaS and finally go live is taking ages. Considering my pricing and according to some statistics I found online, my clients should make a decision within 2-3 weeks, whereas the times are now in the range of 3-4 months and getting longer.<p>As PG suggests in one of his essays, I&#x27;m &quot;digging a hole that&#x27;s narrow and deep&quot;. I&#x27;m targeting a few thousands companies worldwide. The business area they&#x27;re in is fast-growing and fast-changing and I suspect that they might be wary of adopting innovative solutions because they don&#x27;t have clear ideas about where their own business is heading. Some don&#x27;t even seem to have clear ideas about the prices of their own services and products (I tested this hypothesis by offering a simple, free tool to help them model their costs, and the feedback has been clear and positive).<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say there&#x27;s a risk of regret: I&#x27;ll certainly regret it. Presently, apart from my mental exhaustion, I&#x27;m in pretty good shape, both physically and financially, but I need to set limits and draw lines. One of my main worries is that I cannot figure out what&#x27;s not working, why I cannot get more clients on board and why it&#x27;s taking so much time for them to go live. I developed the app at blazing speed and now the sales are going so slowly that it looks like nothing is moving and I find that unbearable. Maybe I&#x27;m just missing some entrepreneurial skills? I wish I knew which ones. Right now, I would just like to get rid of the whole thing, as irrational as it may seem.",1386338153

I used essentially the same methodology nearly three years ago to estimate the potential maximum price of Bitcoin over time, but I reached a different conclusion: <a href=\"http://cs702.wordpress.com/2011/05/29/on-the-potential-adoption-and-price-appreciation-of-bitcoin-in-the-long-run/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cs702.wordpress.com/2011/05/29/on-the-potential-adopt...</a><p>The main difference between BofA&#x27;s analysis and mine is that I see Bitcoin as a <i>far superior</i> alternative for many financial and other types of applications.  For one, Bitcoin as a platform provides a global, decentralized, irreversible log of programmable transactions. For another, bitcoins as &quot;money&quot; are easier to secure, transport, hide, and backup than all prior forms of money ever used by civilization. (Actually, no prior form of money ever used – whether made of bank credits, paper, metal, or other substances[1] – could be backed up like a Bitcoin wallet.)<p>Therefore, <i>if</i> Bitcoin continues to work as intended (i.e., proves immune to attacks) and gets easier and safer to use (for non-technical people), it will slowly gain credibility in the public’s mind, <i>not just as medium of exchange and store of value, but also as application platform</i>. Over a period of many years or even decades, as the world gradually learns via trial-and-error how to use it, becomes familiar with its properties, and ultimately comes to trust it, nothing can prevent Bitcoin from gaining as much credibility as other alternatives, including gold.<p>--<p>[1] I highly recommend Nick Szabo&#x27;s essay on the origins of money: <a href=\"http://szabo.best.vwh.net/shell.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://szabo.best.vwh.net/shell.html</a>",1386338026

At least, the part where you need specific code paths for every web browser that you want to support.<p>It&#x27;s sad, really.  We&#x27;ve had HTML5 sold as the holy grail where you get to write your code to The Standard and it will work the same everywhere.  Except The Standard is open enough to interpretation that no two browsers implement the same thing exactly the same way.  And little bugs in one browser&#x27;s implementation mean you can&#x27;t rely on individual features, to the point where <i>most</i> features have to be either crossed off your wishlist or worked around.<p>It was the same when the DOM and CSS changes came in around the turn of the century, and all you need do was code to The Standard and everything would work everywhere.  (But then Netscape 6 came out and couldn&#x27;t even render netscape.com anymore.)<p>The saddest part is that this same demo could have been written in Flash (a 15 year old version of it if we wanted), and it would run not only on every major browser in existence, but also faster and smoother by pretty much any benchmark you care to name.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still have my bet squarely on HTML5, and I really really want the browser vendors to get their shiz together.

I thought it was just saying &#x27;please flush more often&#x27; and the how is client-side code supposed to know what went wrong when it goes wrong, and how is it supposed to roll it back for the user?  In a typical web server, does the request have to be held until the mongo eventually acks so the user isn&#x27;t lied to?",1386335480

6860858,comment,6859371,6859678,1,0,acdha,,,"> 1. The fewer steps, the less chance of making a mistake. With node/npm there is no need to set up anything, &#x27;virtualenv&#x27; is enabled by default, just npm install and you&#x27;re set.<p>You&#x27;re assuming that setting up virtualenv is a heroic, error-prone process rather than a couple seconds the first time you get a new system – just like node/npm.<p>Once you&#x27;ve installed virtualenv or npm, the process is identical: you need something, you install it and if something breaks you have to debug that particular package. In both cases, you&#x27;re going to need to be able to read an error message and in neither case does the challenge usually involve packaging rather than, say, an issue with a shared library or incompatible/unavailable dependencies.<p>> 2. Some tools make it easier to detect the mistakes and guide you to a solution.<p>Again, there&#x27;s no meaningful difference between the two unless you choose to make your environment complicated, which is not a problem specific to a language. I use both node and python on a regular basis and there&#x27;s no general conclusion to be made about either one – npm installs are slower, python requires me to activate a virtualenv when I open a new window[1], and none of that really matters because no developer should be spending all day installing packages or opening terminal sessions.<p>1.

6860852,comment,6859832,6860688,3,0,icebraining,,,"Let me try to unpack the problems. sgk284 described two situations:<p>- One is that Amazon can identify your wallet when you pay them for something.<p>My objection is that if you have multiple addresses, it&#x27;s not easy at all for Amazon to know if they all belong to you or not. Of course, it doesn&#x27;t work if you just create an address, transfer the payment amount to it, and then immediately transfer it to Amazon.<p>But if you keep a savings address and few payments wallets and maybe a web wallet (which is not really a &quot;wallet&quot;, since it mixes your bitcoins with everyone else&#x27;s), it becomes increasingly hard to tell apart.<p>- The second problem is that Amazon, having identified your wallet, can then see what <i>other</i> retailers have you bought from.<p>But this doesn&#x27;t work, because other retailers will use payment processors, and that kind of tracking (correlating in → out) doesn&#x27;t work, because payment processors don&#x27;t do that. Instead, they pool all the payments and send you (the retailer) a single transfer at the end of the day/week/etc.",1386335009

Although I&#x27;d say most no-SQL databases guarantee partition tolerance (I can guarantee availability using a SQL database).<p>SQL Express runs as a single instance on a client so you get all three - consistency, availability <i>and</i> partition tolerance[1]. When running something else on more than one node you can choose two of those three. Availability and consistency are usually chosen because of business drivers. If partition tolerance is required (I&#x27;ve yet to encounter a scenario that makes a compelling case for it [2]) then eventual consistency is the price.<p>There are databases out there that will suite any combination of the three. Unfortunately the equation is somewhat more complex because databases that offer consistency and partition tolerance (for example) don&#x27;t typically offer JOIN -like functionality.<p>Everything&#x27;s a trade-off.

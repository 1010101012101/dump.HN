Or when people nearly got blacklisted from industries because a couple of people hated their political views?  Or perhaps a certain portion of the media&#x27;s attempt to sweep under the rug any bad behaviour by groups they consider &#x27;disadvantaged&#x27;. Or a willingness for certain social media sites to ban people and delete content for mentioning those negative issues.<p>A lot of this isn&#x27;t boycotting.  It&#x27;s trying to kick someone off a large portion of the internet because they said something you don&#x27;t like by pulling strings or falsely reporting their work as &#x27;illegal&#x27;.  It&#x27;s trying to remove &#x27;wrongthink&#x27; because your political narrative crumbles the minute it&#x27;s put under any scrutiny.<p>There&#x27;s definitely an interest in censorship there.

I&#x27;m comfortable with your basic HTML/CSS page, have a basic handle on Javascript (assuming I&#x27;m not doing anything more complicated than using getElementById to change some attributes on a click), and I can use jQuery/Bootstrap when I need to.<p>Right now the biggest hump for me is figuring out how to make mobile-friendly sites WITHOUT resorting to a framework. I feel like the vast majority of books or e-courses right now will go the following route:<p>1) Teach basic HTML/CSS for barebones basic and legacy pages<p>2) Introduce HTML5 syntax<p>3) Briefly show how to do a &quot;pure&quot; mobile-friendly page using \nviewports, flexbox, and media queries.<p>4) Spend fifteen minutes on the above, and then say, &quot;But that&#x27;s too much work. So now we&#x27;re gonna use Bootstrap and never do Step #3 again!&quot;<p>That above has happened consistently, and it disappoints me. I can do Bootstrap, but frankly I hate writing it. I feel like I have to go five or six div&#x27;s in deep before I&#x27;m actually writing any text that&#x27;s going to be visible to the end-user.<p>I&#x27;d really like to find more resources on making a mobile-friendly webpage that doesn&#x27;t rely on Javascript to resize itself. In particular, I&#x27;ve got a few webpages that I built as past projects or coding exercises that I otherwise think look fine, and I&#x27;d like to figure out how to easily retro-fit them so that, say, the images don&#x27;t stretch more than 100% of the screen width without having to rewrite the entire page using jQuery.<p>Anyone have any suggested resources for building mobile-friendly pure HTML/CSS sites?",1454810073

It would also allow for the use of a CDN like Fastly, Akamai, CloudFront, or CloudFlare in front if things get very hot.<p>An even more impressive trick might be a TLS server with SNI running vhosts which could check that the content was signed by a keybase user with a DNS proof for controlling that same domain.

There&#x27;s a lot more to China than just the eastern areas. Xinjiang and Tibet are two areas of the PRC that are essentially occupied countries experiencing ethnic cleansing via dilution. The ethnicities that are the majority (or used to be the majority) in these regions are second class citizens in the PRC.<p>Insterestingly, I think by using China as an example is an example of an issue I&#x27;ve raised a few times in this thread. Countries as large as the United States and the US are hard to generalize about. There are many remarkably different regions flying the same flag. One of the issues the frustrates me is that Silicon Valley needs to be representative of the United States instead of California, neighboring states and those US states and cities that many California transplants come from. Large countries have utility insofar as exerting economic, political and military force upon other nations, but they present internal complications because of internal diversity. There&#x27;s no reason that Silicon Valley should be representative of US diversity. US diversity is and should be merely one of several contributors to diversity of Silicon Valley. The US, like China, is one nation composed of many states many of which could function as their own nation as many countries in the EU do.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashan"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashan</a>",1454809078

I mean to claim that restricting foreigners from competing in US labor markets is bad for the same reason that restricting black South Africans from competing in the labor markets of white South Africa is bad.<p>In apartheid South Africa, it was illegal for blacks to work in the white parts of South Africa without getting a permit (sort of like the H-1B visa or the green card in the case of the US). Most people consider this to be wrong primarily based on the intuition that such severe discrimination on the basis of  race is unethical.<p>1. Why is it not okay to discriminate on the basis of race but okay to discriminate on the basis of country of birth? Why is it not okay to require that only highly skilled, highly paid black South Africans be allowed to participate in the labor markets of white South Africa but okay to disallow less competent Indians willing to work for a lower wage access to the US/UK labor markets?<p>2. The South Africa analogy is particularly compelling because black South Africans were not considered citizens of white South Africa.<p>This analogy is not original to me. I stole it from Lant Pritchett. This is what he says in &#x27;Let their people come&#x27;:<p>&quot;The analogy between apartheid and restrictions on labor mobility is almost exact. People are not allowed to live and work where they please. Rather, some are only allowed to live in places where earning opportunities are scarce. [...] The restrictions about who can work where are based on conditions of birth, not on any notion of individual effort or merit. The current international system of restrictions on labor mobility enforces gaps in living standards across people that are large or larger than any in apartheid South Africa.

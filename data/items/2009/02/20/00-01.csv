488115,comment,487601,487662,0,0,sstephenson,,,"Cool, django-compress looks similar to the sprockets-rails plugin. A few differences:<p>django-compress makes you define your source files and concatenation order in an array in a configuration file. Sprockets lets you define your dependencies with annotations in the source files themselves, meaning plugins can have their own dependencies and integrate themselves with your applicaton's build system.<p>Sprockets doesn't do minification yet.<p>Sprockets doesn't do CSS concatenation, either. But it does have an asset provisioning feature, where plugins can specify a collection of files (e.g. css, images) that should be copied into the document root. (Rails itself provides basic CSS and JS concatenation.)<p>It's nice to see other similar but independent implementations of the same idea.",1235091375

488100,comment,487686,487686,0,0,sho,,,"This is probably going to go against the grain a little, but I have some problems with GitHub.<p>Firstly and probably most obviously, their business is based almost in its entirity around a single third party open source tool, without which they would have nothing at all, and yet their site is not open source. I know they have every right, legally, to do this, but to me it seems .. exploitative.<p>I wouldn't even care, really - that's what it's all about, after all - but they're just so arrogant about it. Wanstrath especially. Just go look at the very latest post on his blog. The last sentence - ""Welcome to distributed version control."" is just so smug and really rubs me up the wrong way.<p>Maybe I'm an idiot for thinking that way, it's very probable, but something just feels wrong.<p>Secondly, the whole point of distributed version control is that it is <i>distributed</i>. Github is the antithesis of this! And it has real-world consequences, too - it's slow as hell. It's not Facebook for programmers, it's Geocities for programmers, and I for one can't wait until all those Github users learn how to set up their own repositories.<p>Don't get me wrong, I don't hate Github. It's nice looking and works fairly well, apart from the speed. They certain picked the right wave to jump on and it was very right place, right time. And I love git.<p>But Github can't last that long, IMO. Trying to force a distributed version control system into a ""hub"" is not sustainable. Many people, including myself, would never host the fruit of their labours on some free ""social"" site. And the web interface is better than gitweb but hardly light years ahead of everyone else.<p>I think it's just a matter of time before we see a proper distributed git community - a ""git mesh"", if you will. Obviously there are some pieces missing before that can occur, but I think it's inevitable. These ""hubs"" never last. Just try to name one that has.",1235090236

488096,comment,487773,487959,0,0,theotherjimmy,,,"from my experince at 16, you are correct. volenteering with te school will get you into trouble. get the kid a computer of his own with an open source operating system on it. this is a) harder to break than windows  and b) a more friendly platform for exploration. I did this at 13, but my parrents are hacker literate.<p>I cannot comment on ethics though, or parrenting. Both of my parrents were computer scientists at one time in there carreer, and I still bounce Ideas off of my father. Personaly, I think this is the best way to grow up with such a skill set. my only regret is that I have not had much motivation to hack when I can have a rely interesting discussion with my father.",1235089801

Google uses annotated timeline primarily for their Finance site, which has a lot of data.<p>Long time ago, before new JS engines (FF 3.1B2, Webkit Nightly), canvas performance was not very good. I remember I abandoned my JS charting experiments because of this. For simple static graphs it was ok, but changing complex graphs based on user input was painful, redraw was not fast enough to have a smooth experience.<p>It was especially bad on Explorer, which doesn't have native canvas support, so it must be emulated (usually using VML via ExplorerCanvas from Google [1]). I think Flot also uses ExplorerCanvas.<p>BTW There are a pure JavaScript solutions for annotated timelines, though they look different - MIT Simile project's Timeline [2] and Timeplot [3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://simile.mit.edu/timeplot/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://simile.mit.edu/timeplot/</a>",1235089645

488086,comment,487349,487593,0,0,gyardley,,,"The presentation combines data from a lot of sources, including some of the quality applications you've mentioned.  I didn't break out the retention characteristics by decile, but late in the presentation there's a slide on cumulative sessions over time by decile.  As you can see from it, there's a small percentage of kick-ass applications people return to disproportionately.<p>I honestly can't tell you what's best for your business - a series of quick applications that many people will buy on impulse, use once or twice, and uninstall, or a quality application that's lovingly supported, sold at a higher price point, and gains additional users gradually through a growing reputation.  Luckily, the AppStore supports both styles.<p>Greg Yardley\nCo-Founder, Pinch Media",1235089037

The barrier for paid applications is a lot less - about a tenth.<p>I've seen application developers experiment with this approach, generally using in-application advertising, but the conversion rates aren't compelling - and if you fail to get ranked, then you've blown a lot of money.  I'd only try it in conjunction with a lot of simultaneous free press, working whatever opt-in e-mail list you've built up for your app business, etc.  And I'd stop for a bit when you get onto the top 100 and let the natural benefits of just being on that list carry your application higher.<p>Greg Yardley\nCo-Founder, Pinch Media",1235088822

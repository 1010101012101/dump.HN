(every menu in almost every application I use contains <i>only</i> Cmd shortcuts).<p>- The ability to remap shortcuts to anything in a menu being <i>built into the system</i> for all apps systemwide (System Preferences -> Keyboard) is amazing and underappreciated, methinks.<p>- The almost completely consistent use of a single windowing toolkit (Cocoa) everywhere makes a whole bunch of controls incredibly consistent in feel, which includes all textboxes supporting OS X and Emacs cursor movement keys, irrespective of the application - the mind boggles. o_O<p>- Similarly, the systemwide use of Cocoa means that the endless tools that allow for keyboard rebinding and window movement that we see (Slate, BetterTouchTool, ...) not only <i>can</i> exist but work very reliably and with few corner cases with most-every application on the system, oftentimes through the Assisted Access APIs (another thing Apple do well on all their platforms, I&#x27;m quite reliably informed).<p>OTOH, on Linux I use Xmonad as my DE and I will admit to missing the amazing keyboard-based window control I get with the tiling window manager (I use Slate on OS X for a poor facsimile to the same effect).",1389646718

7053172,comment,7051121,7052668,6,0,rprospero,,,"The reason why that specific group was chosen is that they represent non-voting citizens.  There are 73 million Americans too young to vote.  They are subject to laws and pay sales taxes, but have no representation in the government.  The proposal isn&#x27;t a &quot;reward&quot; for being a good breeder, but an attempt at rectifying that almost a quarter of the population has no electoral power.  I believe that the age range was mostly chosen to ensure that these are parents of children who are not of voting age, but I think it would be easier to allocate one vote to each social security number and let parents proxy vote for their children.  Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure that this is a good idea, I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s any worse than just denying representation to a segment of the population.<p>My other concern is your policy on referendum for war.  I&#x27;m opposed to war and would vote no on pretty much any referendum.  However, I also have cerebral palsy and am completely ineligible to serve.  Do I not deserve a say in our foreign policy?  Also, the US has gone through its past few wars without instituting a draft.  My more bellicose relations would be able to vote for this war without any serious fear of being drafted.",1389646301

BASIC typically used one, as did many other languages. Smalltalk is famous for using a virtual machine, for example. Microsoft&#x27;s original Mac apps all ran bytecode in a virtual machine.<p>It seems crazy, because these computers were already tremendously slow, relatively speaking, and adding a virtual machine makes it much worse. However, it was ultimately a useful tradeoff because these machines were even more limited on RAM than they were on CPU power, and using a virtual machine with bytecode that allowed for an efficient instruction encoding could save a lot of space.

These states are completely ignoring an entire demographic!<p>First, Wyoming should not be on the list. They had zero students take AP CS.<p>For the other states, here are the total number of students that took AP CS in\n2013.<p><pre><code>    Alaska       21\n    Idaho        47\n    Kansas       47\n    Mississippi   1\n    Montana      11\n    Nebraska     46\n    North Dakota  2\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s obvious that North Dakota and Mississippi should also have been left off\nthe list as they had less than five students take the exam. We&#x27;re now down to\nfive states. Let&#x27;s look at the Hispanic population size in these states[1]<p><pre><code>    Alaska       6.1%\n    Idaho        11.0%\n    Kansas       11.0%\n    Montana      3.1%\n    Nebraska     9.7%\n</code></pre>\nWith these percentages, we can calculate the expected number of Hispanic\nstudents for each state.<p><pre><code>    Alaska       1.28\n    Idaho        5.17\n    Kansas       5.17\n    Montana      0.341\n    Nebraska     4.462\n</code></pre>\nSo we can take take Montana and Alaska off the list.

I ran into this on my own site: RedCarpet had a Markdown parsing bug that was fixed in version 3, but the Jekyll that GitHub Pages uses depends on version 2. Jekyll loosened this dependency weeks ago, but it&#x27;s not in a full release yet.<p>- You can&#x27;t use any Jekyll plugins, even the ones marked safe.<p>You can avoid the above by building your site locally and uploading the output, there are still a few other caveats:<p>- Like timrivera mentioned, there is no support for server-side redirects outside the baked-in ones (i.e. www to or from naked domain; name.github.io to domain). S3 has these out of the box.<p>- You can only use one domain per GitHub Pages repository.<p>- GitHub will allow Googlebot to index your repository&#x27;s master branch. If you&#x27;re used to that convention, you&#x27;re out of luck: it&#x27;s hardcoded into github.com&#x27;s robots.txt. You need to use a different name for your mainline branch.<p>- You cannot use a private repo for GitHub Pages, and GitHub&#x27;s terms of service require you to allow other people to fork your public repositories, regardless of license.<p>- There is no support for SSL.<p>If you&#x27;re okay with all of that, GitHub Pages is totally fine. But if you aren&#x27;t, non-VPS alternatives like S3 are pretty attractive.",1389645186

The use of line numbers and GOTO allowed BASIC to run closer to the metal - GOTO 15 is an Assembly Language JUMP to the address of where ever the instruction on line 15 mapped by the assembler. Without it, BASIC would not have been such a successful path to a higher level programming language for serious programmers steeped in assembly language.

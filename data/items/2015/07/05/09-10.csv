I suspect many developers, even Google in some of their examples, will forget to add it or think it doesn&#x27;t apply to them/their app, I find this a huge concern (the web until now embraced accessibility as a universal value).<p>Web Components are not ‘just’ composites of plain old HTML, some styling and JavaScript, they require tooling and polyfilling (and some polyfilling will make apps slow for users that don&#x27;t have the latest tech). This is potentially bad for new people in the industry (have to learn many tools before they can get started), and bad for users (as their device might be toos low).",1436090369

9833022,comment,9832825,9832825,0,0,danabramov,,,"Hey, lib author here.<p>Let me first explain Flux in five seconds.<p>Instead of mutating your models, any data mutation in your app is described as a plain object describing “what happened” (e.g. { type: LIKED_POST, postId: 42 }) and broadcasted globally. Models (called Stores in Flux) have no setters and change their internal state in response to specific mutation objects (called Actions).<p>The goal of Flux is to have single source of truth and make it easy to avoid race conditions and cascading updates. If some data is wrong, just repeat the same Actions in the same order, and you&#x27;ll get the same data in Stores. Very easy to debug.<p>Now, for Redux.<p>It keeps the properties of Flux (mutations described as objects), but instead of Stores mutating internal state, it has Reducers—pure functions with (state, action) => state signature. While writing Flux apps, I noticed that the _essence_ of every Store I ever wrote was a reducer function.<p>It turns out that using pure functions instead of event emitters has many benefits: they are composable (<a href=""https://gist.github.com/gaearon/d77ca812015c0356654f"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/gaearon/d77ca812015c0356654f</a>), it is possible to hot reload their logic (<a href=""https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5688a6141e6a86baca5d252463dbbce86f8f71d2/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f662e636c2e6c792f6974656d732f325a324433553236306432413331316b3242307a2f53637265656e2532305265636f7264696e67253230323031352d30362d3033253230617425323030332e3232253230706d2e676966"" rel=""nofollow"">https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5688a6141e6a86baca5d25246...</a>).<p>I wrote Redux for my React Europe talk about Hot Reloading and Time Travel (<a href=""https://github.com/react-europe/cfp-2015/blob/master/live-react/proposal.yaml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/react-europe/cfp-2015/blob/master/live-re...</a>).

That is just how it is meant to be used by the folks designing it: transferring content. Calling that stealing would be like calling the righteous transport of goods from one warehouse to another warehouse stealing: it is not, all involved parties know that after the transaction the first warehouse will be empty and the latter is full. The premise set in this article (first move, then use the object again and expect it to have content) goes against this.

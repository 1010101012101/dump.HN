556964,comment,556908,556950,0,0,alain94040,,,"Here are some details based on my personal experience (I have been under 6 different visa status over the last 15 years).<p>There is a misconception that an investor visa requires cash investment (in the order of $500K to $1M). That's false. This number comes from the EB-5 green card route. The E visa is a temporary visa, but it is valid 5 years and renewable pretty much as long as you want. There is no minimum cash investment required in the statute.<p>You do need to convince the US embassy of your home country that you have a good business plan. Actually, to be convincing, it better be more than a plan: early customer interest, letters of intent (LOI), etc. all constitute strong elements to include in your application.<p>In line with PG's idea, letters from prominent VCs about their interest may work as well.<p>For about $6,000, you can get a good, proactive immigration lawyer to prepare your case, assuming your business opportunity is real.",1239405938

Why, a 4-foreigner web news or classified startup could put dozens of (unionized, citizen, voter) newspaper employees out of work!""<p>Of course I don't believe this is true, nor would it even be a good reason to restrict entry if it were true. (Better to have the new disruptive companies here, than elsewhere.) But that's the sort of deranged logic used against broader immigration. The neat trick of limiting the visas to those starting companies will only help a little against anti-immigrant emotions.<p><i>They wouldn't all grow as big as Google, but out of 2500 some would come close.</i><p>I suspect close-to-Google-scale successes come more like 1-in-100,000-tries than 1-in-2500. There's a tendency to see every startup as a potential little Google -- we could call this 'Google Goggles'. But Google is one-of-a-kind, and it shouldn't require even one success of that scale to make the case for broader immigration.<p>For example, shouldn't these visas be available to immigrants whose 'startup' is a donut shop, nail salon, or bodega?<p>(I also suspect such a program could be easily gamed... but as I'd like to see more immigration of anyone ambitious, I suppose that's a feature not a bug.)",1239405719

9126683,comment,9126347,9126660,0,0,hurin,,,"That document which you sign presumably stays confidential between the retailer and you (i.e. a perspective employer won&#x27;t see it).<p>The article also states that:<p><i>If someone started to take the course and paid for it—if they change their mind and they want to get their day in court, we’ll refund their money and put the case back in the retailer’s hands. They’ve got multiple opportunities to step back from this.</i><p>So I&#x27;m not sure how the two of those square.<p>I&#x27;m not vouching for this sort of practice (and it&#x27;s probably been abused) - but it may in fact be preferable for a dumb young teenager/adult, to take an online course, than to have theft on their criminal record (that would probably make it pretty hard to find employment, even at a crappy job).",1425207571
9126682,comment,9125865,9126520,0,0,lambda,,,"The moderation works based on votes one one of a few pre-canned reasons from several different users. If enough users vote to close, the pre-canned response that the most voted for is what is listed. That means that it doesn&#x27;t always exactly match the reason that the question was really closed, but it means that it&#x27;s possible to give an approximate rationale for the close that was performed by several people, not a single person.<p>I have answered a lot of questions on StackOverflow. One of the worst type of questions is the &quot;please, write this code for me&quot; question. There are frequently lazy or incompetent programmers who just ask for code to do their job, along with students who are asking people to help them cheat on their homework. So many people on SO are very quick to downvote and close any such questions.<p>Now, there&#x27;s a grey area. Asking how to do one specific task which is a small component of a larger program is different enough than asking someone to deliver a completed program to you that it&#x27;s tolerated. Asking something like &quot;how do I use this one facility in a language&quot; is different than asking &quot;please write this tool for me.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s also just the fickleness of the crowd. Any site which is based on voting, like StackOverflow, Reddit, HN, and so on, can have some questions upvoted and some downvoted due to sheer bad luck, different sets of people looking at different sets of questions, and so on. Trying to expect that a large group will act in a coherent manner, when only a small subset of that group ever even sees any given question (and with strong bias, as different people follow different tags), is just going to set you up for disappointment.<p>> nobody who&#x27;s fundamentally asking other people to just do their work for them is asking about text->html transformations in elisp, it&#x27;s pretty easy to read between the lines and see that.<p>Actually, take a look at melling&#x27;s later comment: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9126537"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9126537</a><p>>  Elisp isn&#x27;t the most widely used language so coming up to speed could be time consuming.<p>Yep, sounds like he was just asking someone else to do a job for him, he wasn&#x27;t interested in learning elisp.",1425207348

This is just the confirmation bias and similar factors at play.<p>Those, who have studied human physiology, not just cellular metabolism, which is also important, could tell that the problem is too complex to be dealt with by silly slogans like &quot;avoid red meat&quot;. There are many subtle ratios involved, not just an ability of a particular enzymes to convert a particular molecular structure into molecules involved in the metabolism and support of the homeostasis, but the ratios among these processes. The balance is what is important. In other words, &quot;substituting the protein sources&quot;, is not that simple as it seems.<p>There is no scientifically proven reasons to avoid dairy products, except for individual cases of lactose intolerance, while there is a consensus that the food industry is the cause of the problem to which veganism seemed to be a solution.<p>Tribal eating habits is a quite interesting topic, btw.<p>As for birth control, this is quite another topic, which, perhaps, cannot be discussed in this context. For some members of so-called &quot;urban-middle-class&quot; in some region of the world the policies of forced birth control are acceptable, while in other societies there are quite different reasons about how many children should a family have and why. And, of course, it is not for some &quot;vegans&quot; to decide what other people in other regions of the world should do.",1425206784

9126588,comment,9125193,9126565,0,0,crdb,,,"Well, depends what you define as tech. I might get some flak for this but in my experience, the AVERAGE quality of developers in Europe and especially in the US is much higher than in Asia. For example, a majority of the data science candidates I interviewed in Singapore, outside the Haskell community would fit all of the data I provided them with and call that their model (the concept of validation never entering their mind). Similarly, most didn&#x27;t know what the relational model was and just wanted to use NoSQL methods without justification (mostly because it&#x27;s hot and would look good on their CV). The exceptions usually already worked in the US, and wanted to come home to their family, so I&#x27;m guessing there&#x27;s a fair bit of brain drain going on. Some specialties which are &quot;harder&quot; to acquire, like dev ops, also help fetch higher levels - I can think of one of our dev ops candidate who was getting 280k USD in Hong Kong managing 100 servers.<p>I&#x27;d say those offers are mostly in the financial industry (obviously) or in big corp (think F500 companies, pharma, etc.) and involved a bit of leadership or specialised experience, not being yet another RoR developer. But keeping up with friends in the US, I find the rates are substantially higher if you can differentiate yourself. YMMV.",1425204465

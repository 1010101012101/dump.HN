If it's a quad core Cortex A15, it should have decent performance, while keeping the cost very low, and high battery life.<p>However, knowing Google's track record with ""new"" products, they usually start out making them very expensive, because of stupid decisions they make (like using Intel chips). They did it with the first Chromebook, they did it with the first Google TV, with the first ""real"" android tablet, the Motorola Xoom, and the Nexus Q last year.<p>For some reason they don't seem to ""get"" the right price for a very new type of product, from the first time they launch it. They need like another iteration or two, before they get it, like with the ARM Samsung Chromebook, which hit the sweet spot for a low-end Chromebook at $250.<p>What ""makes sense"" to me is to do the same Chromebook now, but with a quad core A15 CPU, a bigger battery, a bigger screen and much bigger resolution, and a touchscreen. And with all of that the sweet spot should be $500. Definitely no more than that.<p>But again Google's track record is not great here, and I <i>really</i> fear they will build this with some dual core or quad core IVB chip, and make it like $800, which would be way too much for a Chromebook.<p>I do hope I'm wrong and they get it right though.",1360195079

5179650,comment,5177932,5179257,1,0,juiceandjuice,,,"A map is a hash table. I'm confused as to why you don't use either a custom hashing function or your own custom datatype that organizes your data according to the sequence order of your key. While a generic hashing function that can operate on any type of data could be implemented in the language, I believe the flexibility of defining the hashing function yourself is perfectly acceptable considering the performance implications of having a universal hash function. The reason why is this: The table lookup should fundamentally be roughly an O(1) operation <i>after</i> hashing your key value. A universal hashing function that operates on arbitrary-length immutable sequences would likely be an additional O(n) (where n is the length of the sequence) complexity built into the map structure. I don't believe that's acceptable from a language standpoint.",1360194075

If you use the Advanced plan, that means you are finding enough value in us automatically resolving your problems and giving you proactive guidance.  On that plan, you are paying 2295/month on an annual plan.<p>I know this might sounds like a lot, but its actually reasonably lower than some of our cheaper APM competitors. The bottom line though is, if you are professionally running  a web application, this is chump change compared to the time this saves you:<p>- If you are a 1 person shop with 5 servers lets say, you may be paying ~150/month.  If we just saved you 3 hours this month, you paid for it already.<p>- If you are a company with 30 servers, you probably have a lot more at stake in making sure your servers run well. But also, you probably employ several full time developers and ops people who manage your servers.  You get my point I am sure.<p>This all depends on whether we are able to truly generate huge time savings in your work day by eliminating the time consuming investigations and troubleshooting.

5179603,comment,5178914,5178914,13,0,AngryParsley,,,"First: I completely agree. Keeping plaintext secrets in source control is a bad idea. Encrypting them is a good idea. If you have plaintext secrets, encrypt them <i>now</i> using this makefile or git-crypt. Then rotate them.<p>That said, this solution has a couple of issues:<p>1. It encrypts the entire file instead of individual secrets in the settings file. Encrypted files can't take advantage of many version control features. A small change in plaintext creates a huge diff in ciphertext. Git blame doesn't work anymore. Git diff gets a lot more spammy, since you'll see a diff for the entire settings file if there's the slightest change in it.<p>2. It uses symmetric key encryption. If a developer knows the password to encrypt a secret setting, they can decrypt all the other secret settings. This is true until someone rotates the passphrase and re-encrypts the file.<p>To fix both of these problems, I recommend using Keyczar (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/keyczar/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/keyczar/</a>). If you write the right wrappers, it allows you to encrypt individual settings with a public key. Decrypting them requires a private key that exists only on production servers.<p>At a past job (Cloudkick), sensitive things in our settings.py looked like this:<p><pre><code>  from cloudkick.crypto_wrappers import kz_decrypt\n  ...\n  BORING_THING = ""whatever""\n  SECRET_THING = kz_decrypt(""kz::xxxx...."", ""/path/to/private/key"")\n</code></pre>\nkz_decrypt did exactly what you'd think: given an encrypted string and a private key, return the decrypted string. The private key was only on production servers, so the risk of leaking a secret was minimal. The public key was in source control, so anyone could encrypt a secret. For debugging or testing, one could also replace the call to kz_decrypt with a plaintext string. I wish the code had been released. It was only 100 lines or so.<p>This set-up would require a some extra work for settings files that don't allow code execution. Still, once you've set it up, it's pretty close to the most secure and convenient way to store secrets.",1360193433

A better example is, you might hire a consultant to help you tune up your app, or have your developers get training on performance tuning.  Those developers will then potentially use New Relic or Redgate tools to support them in doing their work.<p>In our world, you just use our product and receive that level of expertise automatically from our service.  Without having to hire those consultants or have your engineers spend their time learning about the insides of IIS.<p>Re: leaking information.  If you are not comfortable with leaking information, you are not using the new SAAS APM tools like us or New Relic.  Thats certainly your tradeoff to make. I have to say though, we worked really hard to make sure we dont collect sensitive data:<p>- We dont load a profiler/debugger into your application like most other APMs (e.g. New Relic).  We collect only external information, which does include errors/stack traces but no data/code/cookies/etc.<p>- We provide a mode where our monitoring service is sandboxed to a non-production vm in your environment, so nothing to install on prod servers.<p>Re: scale. We've handled Viddy.com, Vevo.com, etc.  Are you larger? We do a lot of engineering to reduce the data volume and process it effectively while maintaining high resolution.

I didn&#x27;t use the word &quot;wrong&quot; in any of my comments and I don&#x27;t think I implied it either. What I (thought I) was implying is that the low perceived value of reusable bags was hurting the <i>city&#x27;s goal</i> (note: not &quot;my goal&quot;, which I also never said, though yeah I support it) of reducing the use of plastic.<p>Clearly you&#x27;re taking issue with what you assumed was the subtext of my comment.

10118758,comment,10115607,10118076,0,0,bunderbunder,,,"I have an original Lytro camera.<p>I had a whole lot of fun with it at first, but it&#x27;s fallen into disuse. The live refocusing is a fun trick, but in practice what the camera is really doing is taking ~10 simultaneous pictures with different focal lengths, and letting you choose among them after the fact when you&#x27;re using their special app.<p>The novelty of this trick wears off quickly. In practice, I know what I want to focus on at the point when I&#x27;m taking the picture in the vast majority of circumstances, and if I want to keep my options open I can bracket. In those situations, using 90% of the sensor&#x27;s pixels to record versions of the image using focal lengths I don&#x27;t care about just means I&#x27;m getting a 1 megapixel image when I could have had 10.<p>Where I had high hopes was that this would be great for macrophotography, where focus is a lot harder to get right. Unfortunately it&#x27;s really difficult to convince the camera to focus in close enough to capture the subject. I&#x27;m not sure if this is a physical limitation of the hardware or if it&#x27;s a firmware issue, but either way it was disappointing.<p>So all that negative nellying aside, one spot where I think this technology could be really neat is in computer vision for robotics. I&#x27;m guessing that using a plenoptic camera instead of a stereoscopic pair of cameras for vision would enable capture of better 3D information, or at least 3D information with different characteristics that might be more useful in some circumstances.",1440529154

Certainly women I know don&#x27;t think so.<p>They clearly have a greater number of suitors to choose from, yes, but like you say - men tend to approach women in such great numbers that there&#x27;s no way to know who&#x27;s worth pursuing.<p>How do you have a quality conversation with a stranger when 100 strangers are trying to talk to you simultaneously?<p>To top it off, the stakes are a little higher for women.

10118752,comment,10115336,10118595,0,0,mokus,,,"zinc&#x27;s &quot;ioregs&quot; macro system takes care of that sort of optimization quite nicely these days, actually.  For each peripheral register, one of the things it generates is an &quot;update&quot; structure that the optimizer can eliminate, which allows you to chain updates to multiple fields in a single write.  For example, in my stm32f4-discovery &quot;blinky&quot; example it does the bsrr writes to flip 2 LEDs in a single write (I&#x27;ve inspected the generated asm to verify this).<p>EDIT: nevermind, I realize I misunderstood; you&#x27;re referring to the optimizer being able to see that both reg addresses have the same high 16 bits.  I thought you were referring to the actual interactions with the register contents.  Yea, that makes sense.<p>EDIT 2: for what it&#x27;s worth, i did a quick test just now and found that moving the addresses into the source actually made the generated code significantly worse.  I&#x27;m just tinkering around on a lunch break and I need to get back to real work, so I can&#x27;t investigate too deeply, but the 2 biggest factors I see are that (1) it simply doesn&#x27;t perform the optimization you describe, and (2) it makes things even worse because rather than addressing relative to the peripheral base address it loads a complete new constant address for every operation.",1440529091

That said, a patched MPlayer linking to rump libraries has been able to play OGG files on a Hurd system: <a href=""https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2015-08/msg00027.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2015-08/msg00027...</a><p>Though obviously in the very initial stages, the implications of this development taken to its end could be enormous. Have the GNU Hurd implement translator or server interfaces to the rump drivers, plug it on top of an immutable package and configuration management suite like Guix (actually already being done), and for the first time in history you have a complete, general-purpose microkernel-based Unix-compatible (but beyond plain Unix) system that could rival the likes of GNU/Linux. The great thing about it is that the Hurd isn&#x27;t afraid to break POSIX semantics where beneficial. This makes it have, among other things, processes running under multiple uids, true Plan 9-style namespacing, unprivileged mounts, token-based authentication, and so forth.<p>I&#x27;ve been playing with it on-and-off (including cross-toolchains) and been pondering about Mach kernel emulation on Linux. A pure userland server would be most desirable, but faces real changes with modeling port rights as file descriptors sent over ancillary data, how to reliably handle user-level page fault handling on a per-application basis, mapping VM regions across address space boundaries and properly emulating RPC. Kip Macy did successful work on a port of OSF Mach from the MkLinux sources as a FreeBSD kernel module for use with launchd, XPC and other OS X modules, so I think that might end up being a concession I&#x27;ll look into taking one day. I&#x27;m occupied with other projects in the meantime.<p>It&#x27;d be also funny to have Linux &quot;eat&quot; itself in such a manner by becoming a host for the Hurd. Poetic justice, I suppose. But I&#x27;ll wait to see if the rump kernel stuff pans out first.<p>(MINIX 3 is great too, much better microkernel, but it&#x27;s more meant for reliability rather than exposing end-user flexibility like Hurd does with translators.

10118705,comment,10115683,10117505,0,0,cryoshon,,,"Hm, sounds a lot like Barack Obama&#x27;s defense of the establishment of surveillance, namely that the concerns are purely paranoia and that the government is responsible and trustworthy. Let&#x27;s rip these ideas into shreds.<p>First, your claim that we &quot;aren&#x27;t being actually spied on&quot; is utterly false, given that the NSA has a multitude of programs which explicitly harvest and analyze the &quot;metadata&quot; (telemetry content) and also body content of all American electronic communications. They lied about this, then were refuted-- check the Snowden files online at the Intercept website. They have a dossier on every last one of us.<p>This brings me to your next point, that they can&#x27;t spy on all of us. It&#x27;s all automated, idiot. They have enough hardware to do it, and they&#x27;ve spent years making sure it&#x27;s all done without any hands on from their analysts. This is also in the Snowden files. They don&#x27;t need to &quot;totally reconstruct your life&quot;, they already have it right there, with every shred documented electronically. Sure, they probably haven&#x27;t integrated all the times you popped up on a CCTV or dashcam, but they have the data from your phone, which is even better.<p>Your emails are stored indefinitely and are in a searchable database, tagged by keyword, topic, you name it. Nobody will actively read them, but it doesn&#x27;t even matter since the computer system  has read them already. They know you aren&#x27;t up to anything because they automatically checked as soon as the email left your outbox.<p>Your discussion of the tree in the forest is irrelevant; people react differently to events when they know that they are being watched, which is now the case on a societal level. I will say this again because it is critical for the next section: people react differently when they know that they are being monitored.<p>There is actual impact to people because of this aspect of human behavior. Investigative journalism is moribund because sources are afraid to come forward, meaning that the public has one less (of very few) way of understanding what the government (and corporations) is doing in their name.<p>Then there&#x27;s the problem of the intelligence agencies spying on the political organizations that are supposed to oversee them. They capture all of the political communications too, after all. Remember when Dianne Feinstein publically claimed that the CIA was surveilling her and threatening her as a result of the torture report that was being put together? Think about all of the times that you never even heard about that because the blackmail was successful.<p>Speech has been chilled, with people afraid of saying what they really think for fear of ending up &quot;on a list&quot;. Anyone who runs for office is sure to be already on the list, and frankly, if they&#x27;re running on a left wing platform, may have already been targeted for disruption via JTRIG or an equivalent US group.<p>To speak a bit more about JTRIG, I want to emphasize that JTRIG is an active platform out of GCHQ that is currently operating whose mission is to disrupt, degrade, and encourage obedience among nonviolent, legal groups. They likely target public dissenters and protesters. This is not acceptable, and it isn&#x27;t something that an actual democracy would partake in, but hey, we found it in the NSA&#x27;s slide decks.<p>Moving on, I agree that Big Brother 2.0 takes a lot of data from the big tech companies-- the difference being that it&#x27;s optional to participate. You can opt out, and shut out their tracking or spying, if you want. Can&#x27;t do that with the NSA.<p>In conclusion, the actual impact is invisible to the public, but certainly present. The impact takes the form of things not said, blackmail in private, and disruption via proxies.",1440528622

For smaller matrices it&#x27;s faster to use naive O(n^3) multiply because of the large constant factor with Strassen&#x27;s algorithm.

Likewise, I wouldn&#x27;t speak out loud a lot of common phrases I use in texts, because having a conversation through the medium of a phone is psychologically different than in-person, and I think that&#x27;s the issue I was getting at. While texting, you have to be more cautious about word choice and sentence structure so that you can convey not only the message, but the tone as well, which will naturally come out in-person. 200 years ago, all instant communication was done in person. This is a relatively new field of psychology that hasn&#x27;t seem to be explored due to the fact that, especially texting, is an extremely new form of communication.",1440527377

The ultimate point is absolutely right: you will not make money on your first production run.  But there are three big warnings that should be in BLINK tags under the headline:<p>(1) This is a decent estimate for a completely commodity product (Bluetooth headphones).  No iOS/Android app development, no content development, very little custom firmware or electronics development required.  (That correspondingly means you face the least differentiation and the most competition.)<p>(2) This is for a &quot;plastic and PCB&quot; product build.  That&#x27;s as simple as it gets.  Any product that goes beyond a PCBA inside a plastic enclosure is usually going to have significantly greater design and engineering challenges, not to mention COGS costs.  Moving parts?  Temperature?  Water?  Cameras/lenses?  Sensors?  etc.<p>(3) The marketing / customer acquisition cost is either ignored or assumed to be some laughably small number.  Even at its highest, this article assumes $3/unit customer acquisition cost.  That&#x27;s ridiculous (go look at Fitbit or Gopro or any other filing statements).

It&#x27;s not like they could play the &quot;well the USSR isn&#x27;t _real_ communism!&quot; card - for decades the CP had been a blatant Stalin worship cult<p>It was probably a lot easier and safer for heterodox (from the perspective of the Soviet-affiliated hierarchy) Communists to continue to network with each other within the CPUSA while maintaining a front of orthodoxy within the party outside of their own inner circles than to do so outside, <i>especially</i> given the political climate toward Communists -- without distinctions for variations within that category -- in the broader society.<p>That being said, nothing in the article indicates that Bradbury was a member of the CPUSA. It indicates that Martin Berkeley, a self-described former member of the CPUSA made a number of claims including:<p>* &quot;That Bradbury was one of the more prominent writers of science fiction in the United States.&quot; (which, apparently, the FBI needed an ex-Communist informant to discover?)<p>* That Berkeley &quot;<i>felt</i> Bradbury was <i>probably</i> sympathetic with certain pro-Communist elements in the WGAW&quot; [0] (emphasis added)<p>* That Bradbury denounced supporters of a proposal to expel from the SWG those were Communists <i>or who had asserted their Fifth Amendment rights</i> before the House UnAmerican Affairs Committee as being &quot;cowards and McCarthyites&quot;.<p>* That Berkeley perceived that &quot;<i>some</i> of the writers <i>suspected</i> of having Communist backgrounds have been writing in the field of science fiction&quot; and that &quot;science fiction <i>may be</i> a lucrative field for the introduction of Communist ideologies&quot; (emphasis added, in both quotes)<p>* That &quot;some of Bradbury&#x27;s stories were slanted against the United States and its capitalistic form of government&quot;.<p>So, basically, an ex-Communist described Bradbury as someone with (as far as he could describe) no clear Communist links, but who seems like he might remotely be sympathetic to Communist ideology because (1) he writes science fiction, and some other people who write science fiction are suspected (presumably, by the same ex-Communist) of being Communists, and (2) he&#x27;s opposed to McCarthyism, and (3) some of his writings are read (by, again, the same ex-Communist) as opposing the <i>status quo</i> of the US government.<p>Its appalling -- but not surprising -- that any of that would be noteworthy and considered as evidence of any dangerous Communist leanings by any thinking person in the 1950s.<p>Its even more appalling -- and surprising -- that it would be treated as equivalent to membership of the CPUSA by any thinking person in the 2010s.<p>[0]&quot;Writer&#x27;s Guild of America, West&quot;, formerly &quot;Screen Writer&#x27;s Guild&quot; (SWG)",1440525882

This is the situation in Japan, Germany, Russia, South Korea, and almost all of Eastern Europe.<p>The U.S. population growth rate has also been in decline for the past 50 years, dropping from 1.7 percent to 0.7 percent, heading towards negative growth if this trend continues.<p>So much for &quot;an ever increasing population&quot; to bolster a market that always goes up.",1440525853

10118394,comment,10117970,10117970,0,0,philipn,,,"Yes, almost all employee (and founder!) shares are vested over a period of time.  Typically, shares are vested over 4 years, with a one year &quot;cliff.&quot;  This means if the employee (or founder) leaves before the one year has elapsed, they don&#x27;t get any of their shares.  Then, after this set &quot;cliff&quot; period has ended, they get some fraction of their total shares each month.<p>But based on your question, I&#x27;m guessing you haven&#x27;t yet set up your own founder share structure yet?  If so, that&#x27;s probably the best thing to do first.  Sites like Clerky.com can help a lot like this, and you can figure out how all the bits and pieces work together with a good amount of googling and persistence.  Of course, if you have some money, talking to an attorney about this can really speed up the process and help make sure you don&#x27;t make any obvious mistakes.",1440525834

Anything app that thinks it has the right to pop up notifications whenever the hell it feels like it (and why is &quot;3am&quot; so often when they feel like it?) better have a setting to undo that easily found, or they&#x27;re in for a rude uninstalling. Anything else that thinks it gets the priority interrupt had better be prepared to discover it doesn&#x27;t.<p>Because I need to save that priority interrupt for the actually important &quot;site down&quot; notice.

If it&#x27;s that important, pick up the phone and call me. Provide social proof of its importance by putting your own attention into the conversation.

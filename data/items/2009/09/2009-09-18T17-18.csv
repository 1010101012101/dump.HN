""the big problem to me is that people think somehow humans are distinct and unique {and _above_ all other life forms). That consciousness begins and ends in homo sapiens.""<p>But except for the part I bracketed, the above is pretty much true. There is little evidence of self-awareness in other animals and certainly nothing like what humans display. Along with that, our language ability is unique (Sure I know about signing apes, dolphins, African parrots, et al, wherein minimal language abilities are present).<p>No doubt that animals have emotions. But consciousness? No. Animals other than man live in the ""here and now"". Other than following genetically-programmed patterns, they neither plan for the future nor reminisce about the past as we do. And that is just fine: that's all they apparently need.<p>Some unique situation (I have no idea what ) must have occurred in man's history for the ability to think outside of the ""here and now"" to develop.<p>About the bracketed part: I would omit it because I don't think that there is any design where man has any inherently ""higher"" role/purpose/goal than other animals.",1253296786

I have a number of pink shirts that I wear for work (amongst a whole load of other colours) and I've never even thought about my masculinity when wearing one. Frankly, the opposite seems to be true to me. If you have to put a big sign on your pink shirt talking about ""real men"" then you are pretty insecure about your pink shirt and your man status.</i><p>I agree -- the ""wear a pink shirt to indicate confidence in your masculinity"" trick only worked briefly (was it in the late 90s?), for the first few men who started doing it. As soon as it got noticed and people started writing articles about it, it stopped working, since it was an easily-faked signal; I remember the bars suddenly being flooded with desperate-looking weak-chinned men in pastel pink shirts at some point. Nowadays, I think, that whole phase is over and pale pink is just another colour for men's shirts, though I personally try to avoid it because of all the layers of attached symbolism.<p>This, of course, is the whole point about fashion -- those who aren't at the top try to look like those above them, and those who are at the top try to look different from those below them.<p>If you're thinking ""but surely a highly confident man doesn't care what he wears"" then you're right, but a highly confident man still needs to go to great effort to make sure he doesn't look like he cares what he's wearing, otherwise he risks being confused with those below him.",1253296598

I trained pigs for 4-H and showed them at the county fair. I could walk a pig around with just a cane to tap it and keep it going the way I wanted. Bringing my dog to the fair would likely take all of my strength trying to hold the leash. Dogs require acclimation to novel stimulating situations or they forget their training. Pigs don't seem to care.<p>The interesting thing to me was that if we forgot to feed them they would always seem to be able to take apart the fence and get out to eat.

I think more companies will go this route in the future or at least migrate to Office Online. One of the biggest issues I see with Office is the expense of keeping a homogeneous environment. Every company I've worked for seems to have at least 3 different versions of MS Office at any given time. Sometimes more. We have a decade span -- Office 97 to Office 2007. That presents a lot of support challenges. With a cheaper, or free, product you can always keep people on a standard version. I find the variation in Office versions with radically different UIs (2k to 07 for example) makes switching to an alternative a bit easier. People have learned to hunt & seek for features so if something is in a slightly different spot in OpenOffice it's not a big deal.",1253296115

Hiring a poor developer was somewhat in the noise in overall outcome - in other words, a slow programmer who produces some code that ""kind of"" works might be judged as above average based on other, non-engineering talents (personal communication skills, perception as non-trouble causing, etc)<p>Part of the problem boils down to ""it takes one to know one.""  Even that assumes that you've already got a good programmer and that person has hacked the hiring process enough that they can effectively filter out bad programmers.<p>I'm thinking lately about how we (the hacker community) can help non-IT people judge programmers.  Credentials don't seem to be the answer, personal networking is hard, judging code is usually a flame-war between language acolytes, and in the meantime . . . users are working too hard.  Heck, your typical (non-software oriented) organization can't speak to whether or not language X or Y is the appropriate fit for solution development.<p>An interesting angle for me would be to hear your thoughts about how to build a good programmer and how you would market that person to employers, assuming that employers don't have a super-hacker on board who can help with candidate filtering.",1253294945

If you're selling directly to people, you have one chance to get it right. You need to be 100% sure they will buy what you're selling, at the price you're proposing. Also for several types of service, charging the user may not make sense - who would pay for access to a search engine?<p>With advertising, you're effectively acting as a middle-man, providing the users with the opportunity to buy millions of different things related to your own service. The risk is ridiculously low. That's why advertising as a model works so well on the web.<p>Both are completely valid, good business models. It's just funny how 37singles take every opportunity to make out that a business making money from advertising isn't a 'real' business.<p>The thing that hurts the model is silly people who slap up adsense, don't do their research or learn about how to make advertising work, and then moan about how they only make a few cents a day.",1253294613

Many of my long-time crowd are ecstatic to make $15/hr, and we still hang out on a regular basis.<p>After a few mistakes, here's the tack I've learned to take.<p>Treat everything you give as a gift. Don't expect _anything_ in return, and say so very clearly. This keeps you from giving more than you would like to, and prevents the recipient from asking for more.<p>Any kind of loan leaves the door open to additional requests; after all, they're going to pay it all back, so what's a little more? Which leads to resentment if you decline.<p>Considering it as gift prevents you from going overboard - if a gift is inappropriate (paying off a friend's debts falls here), then don't do it.<p>In my experience, the best way to give money to your friends isn't for the necessities, but for the luxuries. When I go to a party, I bring plenty of really good booze and/or beer. If we go out to eat, we go to nice places, and I pick up the tab. On trips, I pay the difference between the Motel 6 and the Sheraton (or whatever).<p>Part of it is couching it all in the right terms. You aren't doing this for them, you're doing it for yourself. I don't like cheap vodka, I like the good stuff. I don't like Motel 6. Then don't bring it up again.<p>The tone you want to set is that you don't want to share your money, you want to share your experiences. After all, that's how we all became friends to begin with.<p>ADDENDUM: it is also important to leave openings for your friends to help you, in whatever way they can. Right now, I'm prepping my house for sale, and I've had a stream of friends come over to help me clean and fix things. I could just pay someone, but this way is much more fun.",1253294565

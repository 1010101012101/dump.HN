You don't want the magazine owner modifying something basic with an unexpected consequence.<p>I've worked recently on a lot of projects that use Business Rules Engines - similar concept - externalise your logic into tables of data/rules. End users can modify these rules to change the way the system operates.<p>The lesson I learned is that the causal downstream user isn't as cognizant of change control than someone who's been in the development cycle. This led to a lot of unexpected conflicts - for example, a certain threshold was lowered considerably as part of a campaign. This made 90% of submissions eligible for automatic (Straight-Through) processing as opposed to 10% before... Unfortunately the downstream systems weren't prepared for a 9x increase in the amount of load. So it fell on it's face.<p>Not to say this isn't a good idea - but something to keep in mind.",1225007694

344111,comment,344066,344066,0,0,jwilliams,,,"I'm not sure a lot is gained from this comparison (caveat: I've used neither language in anger).<p>PG states that Arc is intended as a 100-year language, so getting your core axioms and constructs right is pretty key. This kind of approach has a higher activation energy, but momentum can continually build.<p>The philosophy for Ruby is getting things done <i>now</i>, although arguably it gained a lot from it's time in the Japanese niche. It's a fantastically productive language and favoured by a lot of productive ""lets get it done"" people (not to say Arc isn't...). This philosophy accelerates quickly, but tends to eventually hit conceptual limits. In my view this happened with Java - but this doesn't mean it's a bad thing.<p>I'm struggling with some of the same problems (in microcosm, maybe nanocosm in comparison). For example, if you build an exception mechanism - do you make it an ultimately flexible signal system, or do you constrain it to certain norms?<p>The latter favours rapid growth as all your libraries have consistent exception mechanisms. I can build a library and integrate it easily with another library. The same applies for a whole bunch of other constructs, such as network models, concurrency, etc, etc. So what you have done is constrain X to allow growth in Y... (A lot of what a language is about is what it <i>doesn't</i> let you do, rather than what it allows).<p>The former may result in some nasty mutations in the short-term - For example, libraries that aren't interoperable because they have different exception mechanisms. However, if you are taking a long term evolutionary view then this approach may yield a much more innovative, stable mechanism in the long term.<p>So really, they are just two different philosophies with different start and end points - that's how I read pg's quotes also.",1225005021
344110,comment,334355,334355,0,0,silverton,,,"This post is almost entirely dead WRONG. It's revenue that matters, period. ""People"" are not what matters. Satisfied customers matter. If you provide a product or service that people are willing to pay for, then nothing ... NOTHING can take that from you. You don't NEED investors. Get off that trip. This article mentioned that, ""the reason Larry and Sergey are so rich is not so much that they've done work worth tens of billions of dollars, but that they were the first investors in Google."" Sorry, but again WRONG. The reason they are so rich compared to the rest of us is that we've lost track of the concept that we live in a Shared Fate world. We're all in this together, but we've forgotten that fact. It is physically and philosophically IMPOSSIBLE for any individual human being to be worth BILLIONS more than any other human being. We all put our pants on one leg at a time and we all only have 24 hours in a day. ""All men are created equal."" Remember that? It's called the Declaration of Independence. I believe your writing eminates from the right motives, but it fosters many of the wrong reactions and sentiments. Find a customer. Provide what the customer requires. No customer, no business. End of story. Yes, this post is intentionally terse and dialectical in order to to elicit meaningful dialog instead of pointless ass kissing.",1225004532

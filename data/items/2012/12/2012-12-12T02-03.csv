It seems like the best way to gain adoption for a product like this is word of mouth. As a totally free product, they could get thousands or tens of thousands of users in a short time period. Real people having positive experiences with a product is the best marketing there is.<p>The strength of glance seems be design and UI. Charging a monthly fee doesn't seem to be the best way to take advantage of that strength. Nice UI products do best when they have lots of people using them. I feel like it's too much trouble to set it up knowing that I'll have to make a purchase decision after 30 days, (not to mention that it doesn't say what the price will ultimately be). This looks like a cool product, but this might not be the right business model.",1355281024

They switched from GPLv3 to AGPL overnight claiming that ""OpenERP SA"" (the company behind OpenERP) owns the entire codebase. Looking at it from many sides:<p>* the product is NOT open source if a single company owns the entire copyright ? why will they not call it proprietary tomorrow ? (they don't have a contributor agreement either)<p>* AGPL is the wrong license to have for an ERP system. In addition to all its ambiguity, AGPL software ""must offer an ... opportunity for all users interacting with your Program through a computer network to request immediate transmission by HTTP of the complete source code of your modified version or other derivative work"" [1]. Does that mean that 2500 users of the software in your company should be able to download the source code of your ERP to comply ?<p>For me, the license switch was to make the software impractical to use for any serious business and offer a ""private use"" license at a price as a vendor lock in.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.affero.org/oagf.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.affero.org/oagf.html</a>",1355281009

Thus maintaining the solid provider as the adoptive parent makes up for this. Of course, a man (evolutionarily speaking) has no interest in raising another man's kids. So the woman has to be sneaky with the affair. If the deceit remains hidden, this setup is by far the best the woman can do.<p>As far as having kids who are themselves not good providers, an alpha man's strategy is usually one of spreading his genes far and wide.

The changes went into 16.0.2 which was released on 10/26/2012.  initial report on b.m.o[1] reads as follows:<p><pre><code>  Steps to reproduce:

  1) Load http://www.delorie.com:81/some/url.txt

  Actual results:

  The User-Agent header exposes the security patch level as either a minor version
  number or as an alpha/beta/pre indicator. This data is exposed twice: in the 
  Gecko version and in the application version.

  While it is of value to expose this data to e.g. AMO, exposing it to all sites
  makes the browser more fingerprintable (see https://panopticlick.eff.org/ ) and
  doesn't serve a purpose more important than user privacy. Point releases don't
  change functionality beyond security and stability fixes, so sites shouldn't be
  sniffing the patch level anyway.

  Making trunk, alpha and beta builds look like release builds for sniffing
  purposes reduces sniffing-related failures that waste time when treated as
  functionality-related regressions by mistake.

  Expected results:
  Expected the version numbers to show the major version of the most recent 
  Firefox beta that Mozilla has shipped and not to show the security patch level 
  or an alpha/beta/pre indicator.

  Additional information:
  Internet Explorer doesn't expose the security patch level in its UA string.""

Why isn't your ""render-player"" not a method?<p>It would have been interesting to go into more details about the CES design. For example, how do the components interact with each other?

You misunderstood my comments about the plastic discs.  I hate them because they take up space, but I love them because they can be copied!<p>Why are there ads in Hulu Plus?<p>Again, a thousand channels I will never use, and I don't get a copy of the merchandise to keep for myself.  What happens when I move out to the boonies and I can't get good internet?  Oh yeah, I cancel all of my web-based subscriptions and I can never watch any of my favorite shows again.  How about my favorite content providers?  Sure, the partners will be paid, 70% of Hulu's revenue goes to... the advertising partners.<p>OK, I wasn't able to find any hard numbers on how much MrScruff gets for his contribution.  But you know, I don't care, if I lose my access when I cancel my credit card and internet subscription.  Tell me what ongoing benefit the ISPs provide!  New content?  No... they just provide peering, and hopefully reliable access, and then they also mail a bill every month.  And guess what... it's more than Hulu is charging.<p>But you're right.  They earned that money.  The telecom lobbyists and the streaming advertisement providers made sure that I can't legally obtain a copy of anything new for myself, and now I'll have to go on needing them forever, no matter how much favorite content I've amassed into my collection.  My archives will never be complete, at least not until I've received next month's internet bill.",1355278210

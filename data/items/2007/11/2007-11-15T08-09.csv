If you want to say that this is really a human operating through indirection, we need to again follow the chain all the way back through evolution and say that it was the fundamental physical laws which ""created"" the knowledge.<p>If I am misunderstanding your definition of ""create knowledge"", please clarify.<p>""<i>human brains do evolution. they do replication and selection of ideas.</i>""<p>I'm not sure if I'm understanding you correctly here, but I'll respond to it as I interpreted it.<p>Let's be more precise, since ""evolution"" can pretty much apply to anything. e.g. The Grand Canyon ""evolved"" from a big chunk of rock. I assume that you're referring to the process of natural selection when you say evolution.<p>It's true that <i>memes</i> replicate and undergo a process analogous to natural selection in biology, memes float around the memepool, and their success at ""infecting"" minds (getting that mind's owner to agree with the meme) determines their fitness, which in turn allows it to reproduce, etc. But this is entirely separate from the process used <i>within</i> the mind/brain to determine whether or not to agree with the meme. Through <i>some</i> process brains arrive at decisions and opinions, and those decisions are what put selective pressure on the memes. But this says nothing about what's going on inside the brain to arrive at the decision, so we can't say that the brain operates by evolution. All we can say is that once the brain arrived at a decision, that decision added a bit of selective pressure on the memepool.<p>Saying that decisions themselves are produced by an evolutionary process is analogous to saying that death operates by evolution. Death is a biochemical process, and there's no natural selection going on inside the organism to cause it to die. We don't yet know what's going on inside a brain to arrive at decisions.<p>Anyway, having said that, there is a theory that brain <i>development</i> operates by something called ""Neural Darwinism"", but I don't know how valid it's considered to be. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_Darwinism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_Darwinism</a><p>""<i>Imperfect replication + selection -> complexity/knowledge</i>""<p>Yes, but the converse is not true; complexity/knowledge do not imply imperfect replication and selection. Natural selection doesn't have a monopoly on all complexity. It's entirely conceivable that the brain uses some ""algorithm"" other than something analogous to natural selection.",1195115871

Hopefully I will expand into other media. <p>I know for myself, how music has enhanced my life and it may sound lame, but I still think that if you discover a new band or some band you never knew of, you might go to a show, experience different music, meet new people or just learn something new.<p>Beside my awesome answer, I think this is a great question and want to hear others responses.

I use Outlook at work and Gmail for my personal email, and I think that the main feature that's missing from Outlook is good search. All the other features that Xobni provides sound, like, well, features. Just because my emails my contain implicit information about my ""social graph"" (whatever that means), it doesn't mean I care about it in my daily work. All I want from Outlook is to give me a decent search feature like Gmail and I'll be happy. It's great that Xobni provides better search than Outlook, but that's not enough to get me excited about the rest of the product. I certainly don't see myself using a plugin that ""enhances"" my Gmail experience -- it's already quite good as it is. Gmail is my inbox 2.0. It came out a couple of years ago.",1195114308

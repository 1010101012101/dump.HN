2886638,comment,2885720,2885774,1,0,JohnLBevan,,,"Nice demo - I like it.<p>I had the same comment - adding a key with this info would be really useful (especially if you could also use it as a filter).
It would also be great if you could draw a line across the graph (optionally applying a curve) to allow the results to be filtered and the section beneath the curve zoomed in on (potentially two curves if you want to cut out anything suspiciously low priced also).  You could also allow this selected section to then be displayed on different axes; i.e. these are the cars with a mileage and price I'm happy with, now plot my selection as price against age.
Further user customisation would also be good - e.g. allowing users to change the meaning of the colours (colors) / dot size.<p>Nice work though - much better way to represent & search this data than the standard fixed range filters.  I'd love to see something like this done for computers; when custom building & selecting processors for example, rather than getting a load of codes, plot serial task performance against price, filter it down, plot parallel task against price & further reduce the data set until you find the ones which meet your requirement.",1313413155

2886623,comment,2886241,2886241,15,0,bignoggins,,,"ad impressions are meaningless. eCPM in mobile ads has been on a precipitous decline. As an example, last year ad revenue made up ~15% of my total revenues and my eCPM was around $3 (with paid apps and in app purchasing making up the rest). This year? It's barely a rounding error (< 1%) and my eCPMs are ~ $.10. Other developers are reporting the same thing across the board. Granted this is for iOS and not android, but I can't imagine android being a whole lot better.<p>To make an analogy with the web, I think mobile ads are pretty much stuck in the Yahoo era. It only works because there are new suckers to replace the old ones. Almost all of the indie developers I know that have tried mobile advertising have said it doesn't give you a good ROI.<p>I'm not sure what the solution is, but to me it's clear that the future for app monetization is paid apps and in app purchases.

Fear of both failure and success are, in short, fear of change, fear of losing control, fear of not being a master anymore.<p>It is indeed quite common to trade a, sometimes illusory, feeling of easiness with the known current situation for the potential uneasiness of an unknown situation given as one the possible outcomes of the failure/success. Particularly in the last case, I have seen that it is not unusual to rationalize that we have already gained achieved should not be ""gambled"" against the changes that would result from the success of the activity we are procrastinating.<p>In short, the ""I'll do it tomorrow"" is usually a ""I'll do it when I will feel confortable with outcomes I now consider most likely"".

In the 60s and 70s it seemed that the weirdos and labor guys were able to work together because they had the same goals.

Password systems, by their nature, require lots and lots of actions from users: making up passwords, resetting them when expired, making a keyfile and keeping it safe and backed up (if using a password manager), remembering a long and random master password, and the list goes on - e.g. remembering not to reuse passwords or use similar passwords. It's been proven over and over and over and over again that users will not do these things. It's not like password managers are new; they've been around for 15 years, and haven't made a dent. We can keep banging our heads against that wall, or we can give users a solution that doesn't depend on them doing and remembering dozens of technical actions. ""This is the key to your bank account. Don't lose it, but if you do, call us.""

2886575,comment,2886187,2886344,0,0,Jebdm,,,"At the risk of repeating myself: the ""opinion"" he is expressing is actually a theory of procrastination.  When you make broad statements like ""the reason why human-beings procrastinate is to feel in control of their life"", you are declaring your belief about why a widespread phenomena occurs of the type which is either right or wrong (or partially right).<p>Making such statements without providing any evidence for them is not only intellectually vacuous (since if there is no need to provide evidence, then any claim can be made), but it leads to bias in others where people assume that because an argument was not made, that the information is ""well known"" or the person providing the information is an expert.<p>There's nothing wrong with sharing opinion.  I'm guessing that the reason he came to the conclusions he did was based on personal experience (probably mixed with some reading); if so, then he shouldn't have said ""the reasons why human-beings procrastinate is to feel in control of their life"", he should've said ""I noticed that I seem[ed] to procrastinate not because of (...), but because I didn't feel in control of my life"".  If his evidence wasn't introspective, then he should have shared whatever his evidence was.  If he didn't have any evidence other than plausibility, then he should've framed what he was saying as a hypothesis (and ideally still explained his reasoning).<p>You don't have to back up everything you say with scientific evidence, but you shouldn't make sweeping claims, especially in fields like this one where the jury is still out, without either providing evidence or qualifying your claim.  (And I don't buy the ""it's too much extra writing"" argument; he could've inserted ""I have a hypothesis:"" after ""Dear procrastinator"" and had it completely covered.)<p>And no, I'm not just being nitpicky; a number of well-known biases like the primacy effect, confirmation bias, the ""trusting the confident statement"" bias I mentioned earlier (which I can't remember the name of for the life of me), and wishful thinking (in this case, wishing for a solution to procrastination) mean that humans are very vulnerable to forming irrational beliefs when ideas are presented in this way.  An ounce of prevention, in the form of stating the reason you believe what you believe at least when you're making new or potentially controversial claims, is surely not too much to ask given how easy it is and how far it goes.",1313412192

If I sell you something for $10, you sell it back to me for $20, and I sell it back to you for $30, GDP is up $60.<p>But in all of Stupidtown, PPP is the village idiot.  First, which basket of goods do you choose?  Whatever you select will favor some cultures over others.  Second, what about the quality of goods?  Butter might be cost the same in terms of hours worked, but for that same amount, the Swiss get pure, mountain-made butter, whereas in LA they get corn-oil margarine.  Then there's the flattened world.  It used to be that you would earn more in Switzerland, but a couch, for example, would cost more.  But now, both go to IKEA and the costs are nearly identical.  A tablet computer?  Flat-screen TV?  Car?  Those things essentially cost the same everywhere.  When the Swiss go on vacation, their better income means they get a lot more and they go to much nicer places.  Then there's taxes.  The Swiss pay about the same percentage as in LA, but for that they get amazing things: free university, guaranteed health care, etc.<p>Finally, there's the wet-finger test.  If the weather models show that it should be sunny and you step outside and it's wet, please consider that despite what you read: it's raining.  I'm American but I've lived in Switzerland, and I must humbly admit that there's nowhere in America that comes close to being as wealthy as Switzerland.<p>Visit Baton Rouge and then visit Zurich.

Investing this money for the sake of it is not always beneficial to the economy or society, I favour a persons right to choose what to do with their own money.<p>I am coming from this from a libertarian perspective, whether you earn 50k a year or 500k the government should not be taking a higher percentage from you than other people.  Especially considering that with a percentage rate whilst the proportion is the same, the actual amount of tax high earners pay is greater (which is socially progressive enough for me, but  perhaps not for you).  I believe I am using the word proportion correctly here, but if not please feel free to let me know how I have got it wrong.<p>Here in the UK the top rate of tax is 50%.

2886493,comment,2885367,2885935,9,0,_delirium,,,"I think your analysis is close to home, but with one huge caveat: it really only applies solidly to the <i>white</i> working class, which is these days only about half the working class (though it depends on how you define ""working class""). The black and hispanic working classes, which are a large portion of the country, are strongly organized within the Democratic Party, though the hispanic working class is a bit more split.<p>There are plenty of disconnects between them and the white middle-class wing of the party as well, especially around issues like gay marriage and separation of church/state, which tend to be seen as ""rich white liberal"" issues. But I think it's a bit more complicated than simple conservatism, and it's often more than balanced by significant left-leaning sentiment on economic issues. There is, for example, huge support for social safety nets, welfare systems, socialized healthcare, etc., among the non-white working class. If you put single-payer healthcare to a referendum in black working-class neighborhoods in Atlanta or Brooklyn, it'd pass by lopsided majorities. So I think the left wing of the Democratic party is fairly well in tune with that portion of their concerns, but most of the party is arguably out of touch by not being left enough on economics, promoting more of a middle-class, centrist liberalism that's roughly ok with the economic status quo and not very interested in major social-justice initiatives.<p>There's also no real cultural understanding between the GOP and this segment of the working class: a <i>good</i> showing for a Republican is 10% of the black vote, almost all of it coming from the wealthier portion (i.e., they only connect on class issues). But I agree that the Democratic connection is not great, either, especially if you take the national party; they're often seen as economic-centrist social liberals, less bad than the GOP but not really willing to fight for the working class on economics (or at least not succeeding at doing so).",1313410382

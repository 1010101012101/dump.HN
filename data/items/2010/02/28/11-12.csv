It just happens to back onto the cloud.<p>I.e: a secretary saves files to their D: drive, and it's in the cloud. And when you run out of disk space, you buy more from your cloud provider and suddenly there's another 10TB on your D: drive.<p>I find this very neat as it brings cloud benefits (around reliability and expansion) to real people, using crappy early 2000s desktop apps - ie, most people using computers.<p>Jesse's blog port on the launch:\n<a href=""http://jessenoller.com/2010/02/09/say-hello-nasuni-launches-today/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jessenoller.com/2010/02/09/say-hello-nasuni-launches-...</a>",1267358127

I wanted to take one last stab at self-employment before turning 40.  (Yes, yet another wannabe iP* developer)  While having a day job and playing WoW prior to the achievement system wasn't a problem for me, having to be self-motivated to work with a constellation of ""Achievements"" at arm's reach probably cost me about 3-4 months of self-funding time getting underway.",1267357332

It would require a sturdy knowledge of linguistics, physics, computer programming, etc. The sampling model in contrast is a piece of cake.<p>The anatomical model does indeed sound very interesting. Each phoneme would be recognized as one particle, on which intonation and dynamics effects could be applied algorithmically; and much of advancement in this area would be employable by speech recognition models, probably increasing their accuracy by a considerable amount.<p>I really hope some serious contenders step up to the plate for this.",1267356842

1156759,comment,1148079,1155740,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"> Just to be clear that all this only makes sense if we assume that intellectual property is a sham.<p>I do. It's a useful sham, however, so I'd think twice before abolishing it.<p>> So with the BSD [â€¦]<p>I don't think the GPL forces you to choose free software. GPL software just can't be used to make proprietary software. Right now, you still have plenty of proprietary alternatives. People still buy them. You still have the choice. In the end, if the GPL takes over, that will be because everybody who didn't chose it will be out of business. I'm not sure this is bad in any way.<p>I think what you actually don't like about the GPL is its give and take nature: if you don't give, you can't take. So, being forced to give imply being forced to take. If nobody is forced to take, nobody is forced to give.<p>Do you think anyone is somehow forced to take? Meaning, does anyone is forced to distribute GPL derived work? Do you have any example (actual or hypothetical)?",1267356390

From what I gather, when they tell you this ""lie"", they actually believe those words. \nAs far as why the lie exists to begin with, well it all boils down to saving face. Women have to keep up their social status, lest they fall victim to the double standard of being labeled a ""slut"", while a men who is true about his desires (and acts on them successfully) is called a ""playboy"" -- with obvious differences in the connotation.\nI won't say too much here, but message me, and I can go more in depth.",1267356056

1156752,comment,1155907,1156553,0,0,DLWormwood,,,"> I wish the sounds were dynamically computerized by way of mechanical simulations of the anatomical parts involved in human speech articulation.<p>Actually, I think that's what was attempted in the first place in the early 80's.  I remember seeing TV shows and museum exhibits that demonstrated this approach.  One I especially remember, and highly dates the efforts, had a vector imaging display (think of the original Tempest and Asteroids arcade games) project a silhouette of a tongue and vocal cavity to demonstrate how the current phoneme was generated to listeners.<p>Of course, back then, such simulacra were limited by lack of parallel processing power and inadequate understanding of biophysics.  This lead to the brute force ""sound sampling"" approach nowadays as memory became more cheap and audio capture hardware was perfected.  I do wonder if it's time to return to vocal anatomy modeling again, now that we have a better understanding of how to perform biometric and physics modeling via massive computational parallelism.",1267355797

What helped a lot was that we had a surprisingly sensible publisher who acknowledged that safe disc prevention was (at the time, I'm not sure about now) virtually worthless and allowed us to ship without it. This gave us the benefit of knowing ahead of time the hashes for various areas of our binary and being able to use and layer those into different checks.<p>While non of these were crack-proof (or even close to it!) they did serve their purpose and prevent any zero-day or launch window warez releases - which as the author states in this article is about the best you can really hope for.",1267355744

They find them sexually attractive, just like men find pretty women sexually attractive.<p>What confuses your argument is that women also tend to go for <i>long term relationships</i> with men that are high status and in such cases seem to place less importance on looks.<p>This leads to situations where the wife of a scrawny and unnatractive alpha male (the emperor of Rome, say) will bear children who bear a suspicious resemblance to a particularly hunky albeit lower status male from her surroundings (a beefy member of the Praetorian guard, say).<p>Which is exactly what this paper is saying: women differentiate between sexual attractiveness and desirability for marriage, but when it comes to judging sexual attractiveness, looks win out.",1267355534

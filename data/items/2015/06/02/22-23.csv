If you have an hour of video footage of a blue car that you happen to collect from an aircraft while tracking a suspect then on it&#x27;s own that says vary little.  Historically you need to track a suspect to there car and then follow a car so together it&#x27;s vary labor intensive to track large numbers of people.<p>However, if the blue car passed a license plate reader it stops being a random blue car and becomes license plate ABC-1234 registered to someone and your now &quot;following&quot; that specific car plus the original subjects car for that hour.  Basicly, the readers enable you to track people not just where the reader physically is but wherever you have footage either leading up to that scan or after the fact. Together you can potentally follow millions of people for fairly low costs.<p>Granted, nothing says the person who the car is registered to is the actual driver, but you have someone who can probably tell you who was driving that car.",1433285843

Error correcting codes allow much shorter error-free communications, with lower probability of failure than your method.<p>Consider an N bit stream of data, with a probability mu of any given bit being flipped.  Then the probability of your stream containing an error is gamma := 1-(1-mu)^N.  Since you&#x27;re sending the identical stream twice, there&#x27;s a 1-(1-gamma)^2 chance that your overall transmission is unrecoverable.  The hash will tell you that the transmission failed, but not how to correct it.  Furthermore, there&#x27;s a probability that your hash has a bit flipped somewhere, too...<p>An error correcting code makes a guarantee that if up to m bits are flipped, the original message can be recovered exactly.  A Reed-Solomon code can correct up to m errors while adding just 2m bits to the message length; even with a pretty conservative upper bound on the number of expected errors, this should be way less than 2N+k.",1433285111

I have heard that what the bill wants to accomplish would require a constitutional amendment due to legislative entrenchment (the current congress cannot bind a future congress) but I do not know what the truth of the situation is.<p>This is pretty universally accepted as true among everyone I&#x27;ve heard discuss this kind of issue, including (especially) legal and constitutional scholars. Anything Congress can put it a law purporting to constrain what laws it can pass, it can undo with any new law, simply by passing a law that conflicts with it.<p>> * Read The Bills Act: &#x27;Yea&#x27; votes require that the congressperson has read/heard the bill (no more &quot;I didn&#x27;t know that was in there!&quot;), mandatory 7-day public review period of final bill text. I think that the additional requirement of a mandatory reading of a bill&#x27;s text before a quorum will keep this one from being considered though.<p>Like OSTA, this is an attempt to legislate a fixed element of the rules of the houses of Congress, and would therefore seem to require a Constitutional amendment, for the same reason.<p>> Enumerated Powers Act: Congress must cite the constitutional authority on which any proposed bill rests.

Using parity instead of mirroring (or a mirroring+striping approach like RAID10) - i.e. RAID3, RAID5/6, and (IIRC) RAID-Z - assumes that disk failures are rare; in reality, the probability of subsequent disk failures increases significantly once one disk failure occurs (which makes sense: unless you&#x27;re mixing/matching vendors (which has its own problems), you&#x27;re probably buying a lot of disks at the same time, probably from the same or similar batches, and therefore with the same failure tendencies).  For things like SANs and other large arrays of disks (where the use of ZFS is more prevalent), the difference in safety between two and three parity disks is negligible.  You could keep adding more and more, but at that point, you might as well just use RAID10.  If you&#x27;re running a smaller array, you also might as well just use RAID10 (or RAID1 if you only have 2 disks in the array, but that&#x27;s playing it dangerous for the same reason why RAID5/6/Zx is playing it dangerous).<p>This is part of the reason why ZFS supports a variety of different RAID and RAIDlike configurations.  If you&#x27;re using a pure-ZFS approach, I&#x27;d strongly recommend having zpool create striped mirrors (i.e. RAID10) in order to get the benefits of ZFS&#x27; data checksumming <i>and</i> not be susceptible to such a high risk of data loss.",1433284332

I have heard that what the bill wants to accomplish would require a constitutional amendment due to legislative entrenchment (the current congress cannot bind a future congress) but I do not know what the truth of the situation is.<p>Downsize DC&#x27;s Agenda page has a list of all of their bills[1]. OSTA is the one I think has the best chance of being implemented. Some others with good ideas include:<p>* Read The Bills Act: &#x27;Yea&#x27; votes require that the congressperson has read/heard the bill (no more &quot;I didn&#x27;t know that was in there!&quot;), mandatory 7-day public review period of final bill text. I think that the additional requirement of a mandatory reading of a bill&#x27;s text before a quorum will keep this one from being considered though.<p>* Enumerated Powers Act: Congress must cite the constitutional authority on which any proposed bill rests.  The full text of OSTA[3] includes this citation.<p>I don&#x27;t view Downsize DC as a very effective organization (don&#x27;t sign up for their newsletter unless you like poorly-formatted rants), so I would love to see other orgs throw their weight behind OSTA and RTBA.

One of the sisters wound up in control of a certain bank account, and after the burial she simply kept all the money left in the account.  My spouse was angry, until I explained that we were <i>never</i> entitled to a dime of it, because my mother-in-law is the one who failed to manage her estate properly.  We could either accept it or go to the graveyard, argue with a tombstone for a few hours, and then accept it anyway.<p>The fact remained that the sister-in-law did what was legal instead of what was right.  She kept the money, and lost the trust and respect.  We haven&#x27;t forgotten.  That&#x27;s why if my spouse and I die unexpectedly, the guardianship of our minor children is now separated from the trusteeship for their inheritance.  If they choose to live with any of my spouse&#x27;s siblings, whoever that is may have to submit their expense receipts to my sister and parents in order to get a check.  We were simply fortunate to have learned something about the moral fiber in the family before it impacted anything actually important.<p>The worst part of the whole affair for me was listening to the person whinge on and on about how much she <i>deserved</i> that money.

Not getting money that was never mine is a very, very, very small price to pay to learn whether someone is trustworthy.

However, they do it the other way around: types are merely values. This is very similar to what you&#x27;re saying except DT languages would not have that<p><pre><code>    5 : 5\n</code></pre>\nInstead, we introduce the idea of a singleton type. It works like this: for any type A and any value (x : A), we have a type (Sing A x) with exactly one value, (TheSing x : Sing A x).<p>The other thing to keep in mind is that subtyping is kind of a rocky place to lay your type semantics. This is rough because most people are used to subtyping in their types. Instead, we note that whenever we have that (A :> B) then we have a function (A -> B) which is injective (really, an &quot;epimorphism&quot;). This broaden&#x27;s our view to consider any injective function between types instead of merely some subtyping relation. Immediately it ought to be clear that (a) this is intractable automatically and (b) it&#x27;s far more rich. Then it turns out that subtyping itself is fairly intractable (which subtypes are the right ones? there are <i>many</i> types intermediate between (Sing Integer 5) and (Integer)).<p>So throw away automatic subsumption and require explicit coercions. This is workable and indeed in use today.",1433283146

9649328,comment,9647253,9649014,0,0,sago,,,"MS responds very well to a whole range of therapies that have no proven disease modifying abilities. It is an almost perfect disease for a methodology to claim success on. The Relapsing Remitting course is variable, so people with the condition are likely to seek new treatment during worse periods, and thereafter regress to the mean. The knock on effects of the lesions in brain and spine can often be self-limiting (tiredness, pain, lack of coordination, mood changes, diminished vision), so are very conducive to placebo effects. MS can in some patients plateau and relapse rates drop off or cease (not often, but sometimes), so it is perfect for testimonials of dramatic benefits, if you don&#x27;t systematically count the failures.<p>If you check out just about any &#x27;alternate&#x27; modality, you&#x27;ll have a very good chance of finding it claims high success on MS. In comparison, most modalities don&#x27;t tend to claim success rates on amputations. Though both involve the destruction of tissues.<p>It&#x27;s a great case study in science based medicine.<p>&quot;what do you have to lose?&quot; - in general time, often money, and a demonstrated reduced likelihood of pursuing scientifically valid treatments. The more claims of beneficial treatments adding to therapeutic noise, the harder it is for individuals to assess treatments properly. On aggregate, we&#x27;re worse off for the claims of well meaning (and hucksterish) folks.<p>&quot;it would be worth the inconvenience of trying it out for a few months even if the odds of success are very small.&quot; - isn&#x27;t that the sales pitch of every snake oil salesman or true believer?<p>FWIW: I have PPMS, and I&#x27;ve heard literally hundreds of claims, ranging from many different (and contradictory) diets, through &#x27;eastern medicine&#x27; to revival prayer meetings. The details of the method change, but the structure of the claims, and the way they use evidence, are remarkably similar.",1433282482

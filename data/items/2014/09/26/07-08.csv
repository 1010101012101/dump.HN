Having insurance is usually the only feasible way to get preventative care.<p>Even with insurance you are often still responsible for a portion of your care, at least until a certain amount. This obligation to pay renews every year in most cases, so even if you reach the limit of your obligation this year, next year you will have to reach it again.<p>If you are not insured, you will have to pay out of pocket.

8371746,comment,8370321,8371302,5,0,mafribe,,,"<p><pre><code>    > The sexism is what made it work.\n</code></pre>\nThis is a nonsensical claim and characteristically (for an\nengineering-oriented discussion forum) a-historic. The reason for the traditional division of labour between the sexes is rooted in biology: before humanity had worked out (1) how successfully to control female fertility and (2) make birthing an almost risk free process (a process that started about a century ago, and was successfully completed  only in the last two decades) a large fraction of women were either pregnant or had recently given birth. Carrying out jobs other than looking after offspring was difficult for them and deeply problematic for society on many dimensions. A lot more can be said on this than I have time for but roughly, it made a lot of sense to give the task of rearing offspring to female and to let men provide, and protect. What you call, with derogatory intent, sexism, are simply the rational sex-based division of labour and the concomitant social expectations that stabilised and on this biological basis.<p>Recent innovations in medicine and fertility control such as condoms have -- to a certain extent -- made obsolete (some of) these sex-based social expectations. However, social expectations evolve slowly, more slowly than technological progress. Moreover, it is entirely unclear if the new orthodoxy, that it is unanimously better completely to abolish sex-based divisions of labour, and modern society is currently in a fierce struggle over this question.<p>Marx, in &quot;Preface to the Critique of Political Economy&quot; (1859) claimed\nthat revolutions occur when technological development has moved so far\nahead of (and hence made obsolete) the social expectations that govern\npropery relations, that revolution must occur:<p><pre><code>    At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces\n    of society come into conflict with the existing relations of\n    production or - this merely expresses the same thing in legal\n    terms - with the property relations within the framework of which\n    they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the\n    productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then\n    begins an era of social revolution. The changes in the economic\n    foundation lead sooner or later to the transformation of the whole\n    immense superstructure.\n</code></pre>\nWhether so simplistic a view is tenable (I don&#x27;t think so) is another\nquestion and I don&#x27;t want to side-track this discussion. Instead\nI want to remix/repurpose the quote:<p><pre><code>   At a certain stage of development of the contracteption technology,\n   the division of labour between the sexes come into conflict with\n   the existing relations between the sexes or - this merely expresses\n   the same thing in legal terms - with the property and entitlement\n   relations within the framework of which they have operated\n   hitherto. From forms of development of the reproductive forces\n   these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of\n   sexual revolution. The changes in the socio-sexual foundation lead\n   sooner or later to the transformation of the whole immense\n   superstructure.\n</code></pre>\nIt is too early to tell how this will play out. On one hand educating women leads to increases in productivity, because skilled workers are so much more productive. Moreover workers who feel (whether correctly or not) feel that they have self-choosen their career paths, their destiny, are also more productive than workers who feel they are herded into a career. Even though women, on average, still work  less then men, I think the impact is already felt, and this\nwould point towards societies without sex-based divisions of labour\nwinning out. But there is an antithetical tendency which is difficult to\nignore: highly educated, working women don&#x27;t have children, or have\nonly few. We already see this clearly when we compare e.g. female academics with that groups with\ntraditional sex-based labour differentiation (e.g.  conservative\nreligious groups, and societies that are too poor to offer educational\noppertunities and up-to-date fertility control and reproduction\nmedicine): The latter are vastly outbreeding the former.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to see how this will play out in the long run.",1411717377

I drink very little because the following [1] is incomprehensible to me:<p><pre><code>   Alcohol â€“ Euphoria has been reported during the\n   first 10â€“15 minutes of alcohol consumption.\n</code></pre>\nI have gotten very drunk and yet not experienced euphoria or anything similar. To be sure, alcohol has physical effects on me (e.g. impairment of judgement and impairment of coordination). But it just doesn&#x27;t do anything mental, for better or worse. I&#x27;d bet that many/most of the 60% or so of people that have less than one drink a week fall in that category. I.e. to us alcohol is &quot;meh&quot;.<p>I&#x27;d much rather have chocolate or sugar than alcohol. E.g. I like Grand Marnier, but that&#x27;s because it has a pleasant sweet taste, not because it has alcohol.

While we have been working on our IntelliJ plugin to edit with others in real time JetBrains has given us discounts, engineering help (via their forums), and we have even started talking to their business development team about getting our plugin more attention. They&#x27;re also very responsive on Twitter. JetBrains is a great company, with good people. It&#x27;s weird to me that as a long time vim user to be so happy with their editors. I still use vim for a lot of editing, but the features in IntelliJ and PyCharm and WebStorm and all the others are amazing. I don&#x27;t use vim anymore to write Java. I use IntelliJ, because you hardly type. You just tell IntelliJ what you want and it writes your code for you, one piece at a time. Even with Python I&#x27;m finding myself using PyCharm more often.

If the treasury ceased to issue new debt, then this &quot;problem&quot; with free-trade goes away. This &quot;problem&quot; is not bidirectional. It does not affect both sides identically. If it did, the &quot;problem&quot; would cancel out. So don&#x27;t blame free-trade for increased debt issuance. Just because they raise your credit card limit doesn&#x27;t mean you need to max your your card.<p>Complaint 2 is also not a problem with free-trade. If China undervalues its currency -- by printing money as the comic states -- to make its products cheaper and therefore not play &quot;fair,&quot; imagine the converse: the US starts printing money out he wazoo. Nope. Not a good idea.  No one would suggest that, and everyone would warn against it. It would lead to increased inflation, which is not good. So if it&#x27;s a bad idea for the US but a good idea for China, what is the explanation for that? There isn&#x27;t one. China is engaging in an enormous monetary scheme that&#x27;s almost certainly not beneficial in the long run, to change a statistic (current exchange rate) and coax the US into buying cheap goods for a while. Imagine if China maxed this idea out:  just gave us everything for free. Yea, doesn&#x27;t do them any good, and comes at a huge cost for them. This is a very poorly thought out comic.<p>Complaint 3 is just very odd. It doesn&#x27;t even attempt to show what is meant by if the &quot;business&quot; goes to Guatemala. How does the math change? If comparative advantage maths say A should make X and B should make Y, what on earth does an organizational structure and trademark name have to do with the production? What in blazes?

7263824,comment,7263490,7263490,9,0,tansey,,,"I&#x27;m not sure why the author picks Myth #5 as the big pro-frequentist point. The &quot;online learning&quot; problem he&#x27;s describing is a simple multi-armed bandit problem. The magical frequentist algorithm that he&#x27;s touting is UCB-1. It&#x27;s a great algorithm, it has finite-time optimality guarantees like he mentions. However, it still has a tuning parameter that can matter quite a bit in practice. Also, the Bayesian approach to MABs is Thompson sampling, which is also finite-time optimal. I guess I don&#x27;t get the big deal on this point.<p>From a machine learning perspective, frequentist methods are great because they scale. All of these fancy nonparametric Bayes methods coming out these days take weeks to run and include so many approximations that you&#x27;ve got no idea whether what you&#x27;re actually inferring is truly similar to the original model.<p>The biggest problem with frequentist methods is that they are conceptually odd in their approach. Bayesians take the view that you should fix the data and integrate over the possible parameters. Frequentists take the view that you should fix the parameters and integrate over the data. That is kind of weird to me.<p>So you either start out conceptually pure as a Bayesian and compromise to the point of meaninglessness or you abandon your morals at the start as a frequentist and things go smoothly from there.<p><i></i>Edit<i></i>: As noted below, it&#x27;s actually Exp3 rather than UCB-1.

7263819,comment,7258866,7262260,1,0,nousernamesleft,,,">My issue here is that types, once defined, rarely change in any significant fashion. Refactoring is (generally) an exercise in mutation of logic, not so much the underlying types. When types do change the code that operates on them drastically changes as well. We&#x27;re no longer refactoring at that point, we&#x27;re re-writing and then the issues more or less disappear.<p>That is the exact opposite of my current experience.  I&#x27;m changing types constantly.  As I flesh out more code, I realize I needed to pass an (Account, Client) not just a Client.  Now the compiler tells me every single line in every single file where I need to fix the code to handle that.<p>>What? In Scala it is perfectly possible to pass an uninitialized reference to a piece of code<p>Because scala has to make bad concessions to java compatibility.  Scala itself is fine, but java opens the door to problems.  I did not say scala accomplished this, I said static type systems can.  Use ocaml or haskell.<p>>Just as long as the count and the X co-ord are of different types. Which I&#x27;d guess isn&#x27;t always the case.<p>But you control the types, that is the point.  So if you choose not to use the type system, then obviously it protects you from very little.  That is not a problem with the type system, it is a problem with you.  You could write a program using only strings if you really hated yourself, and you would thus get absolutely no benefit from the type system.  But nobody would be silly enough to blame the type system.<p>>My belief is that the class of errors they catch are among the most trivial, and most easily caught in testing (unit-testing or otherwise). Thus I simply don&#x27;t see big gains in either runtime correctness or refactorability. Maybe slight ones, but nothing worth the loss of expression provided by more dynamic languages.<p>I do not believe your earlier claim to not have been writing java in scala now.  If you think there is a &quot;loss of expression&quot;, you do not have experience with a modern statically typed language.<p>>&quot;Static type checking limits programs to only expressing things that the static type system can prove are OK<p>And if you have no idea how much you can express with the type system, then you draw bad conclusions from that.",1392821219

7263730,comment,7260368,7261150,2,0,pbacci,,,"Hello there, Pierpaolo from Dropbox here. Good questions!<p>HLS support on Android is quite spotty... yeah... We try our best to build a solution that works as ubiquitously as possible and indeed it gets challenging on Android. Given our engineering resources, we need to pick our battles so a good solution (even if not perfect) is better than no solution. Anecdotally, our code has quite a few conditional statements to deal with Android. For instance, at some point we dag into the code and found that certain useful tags like the EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE (see <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-12#section-3.4.7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-...</a>) are simply ignored. As other folks commented already, we did find the support to be much more stable on ICS and above.<p>Multiple bitrates is a must for a few of reasons. 1) Apple requires a minimum supported rate of 64Kbps, 2) networks are really still incredibly spotty and providing multiple representations enables the player to act intelligently and switch according to the instantaneously measured throughput of the channel. 3) providing a high quality gratifies the users that are previewing content on a fast wifi network.<p>Good point on the segmenter built in ffmpeg. I felt like this part of the explanation was a bit too technical for a general audience but I can comment here. There are several reasons why we went with our own solution. Some are because of the way our pipeline works and the fact that with our tool we can create segments with variable lengths to minimize the startup latency. Specifically, having shorter segments at the beginning of the video allows the player to download less data before starting playout. I want to warn the reader to be careful if you want to experiment this path because the standard poses some constraints on how fast you can change the segment duration. So far, our approach seems to work fine so we are happy with that. Also, at the time we started development we were on ffmpeg 0.8.x transitioning on 1.x and the builtin segmenter support was not great. As we move forward, we are likely to reconsider the builtin segmenter.",1392820129

A higher trajectory gets you into thinner sections of the atmosphere more quickly so you lose horizontal velocity to air resistance less quickly.  Air resistance doesn&#x27;t seem too big a problem to us in our day to day lives, but increases as the square of velocity so at the speeds that artillery shells travel it will tend to start out as a much stronger force than gravity.<p>What ICBMs (and space_bound rockets) do is to travel vertically initially to get out of the thickest part of the atmosphere before starting to put on rotational velocity.  You&#x27;ll notice the article you linked specifies a <i>reentry</i> angle of 22 degrees, not a launch angle of that.  A missile has an advantage over artillery in that it can apply thrust over time, and wait to start accumulating horizontal velocity until it has gained some height.<p>EDIT:  A better way to explain things.  When a bullet leaves the barrel of an artillery piece the forces on it are dominated by air resistance.  As it travels it&#x27;s kinetic energy decays exponentially with distance due to air resistance, and eventually it&#x27;s traveling slowly enough that gravity becomes an equal source of acceleration as it settles into terminal velocity.",1392819926

7263683,comment,7263425,7263425,5,0,karmajunkie,,,"I&#x27;ve seen reports that up to 70% of workers are in jobs that could eventually be automated. This is a pretty scary statistic when you think about it, which is why I&#x27;m also a huge proponent of the idea of a basic income guarantee. With numbers like that, pretty much every job is going to be overcome by competition for the position, no matter how intricate it is, as long as we have this notion that everyone HAS to work in order to earn the right to live—even if there&#x27;s no work available.<p>But if you&#x27;re looking for jobs where your likelihood of being outsourced is negligible, look for the ones that are hardest for machines to do. These, by the way, aren&#x27;t necessarily those at the top of the knowledge spectrum. Doctors as a profession, for example, will eventually fall to machine learning systems like Watson, and medical school will become more a technician&#x27;s school than anything else.  Nurses, however, perform a wide variety of functions that are difficult to automate safely, nor can they be offshored. Its difficult to outsource sticking a needle in someone.<p>Last thing: I&#x27;d argue with the idea that web development is commoditized. At the lower end of the spectrum, sure—tons of wordpress themes out there, its easy to offshore something like that, basic development provided by good software. But higher up the food chain, where you&#x27;re at the end of the market where you actually DO stuff like write original javascript, or develop some new server platform, or whatever it is on that end of the spectrum—those jobs aren&#x27;t going anywhere for awhile.",1392819475

An interesting read.<p>Apart from the political and human-rights implications, what I find most interesting is how the police knew what Miranda was actually carrying. Paragraph 11 of the judgement quotes a police document (written before Minranda was stopped) justifying his detention:<p><i>&quot;We strongly assess that MIRANDA is carrying items \nwhich will assist in GREENWALD releasing more of the NSA \nand GCHQ material we judge to be in GREENWALD’s \npossession. Open source research details the relationship \nbetween POITRAS, GREENWALD and SNOWDEN which \ncorroborates our assessment as to the likelihood that \nGREENWALD has access to the protectively marked material \nSNOWDEN possesses. Our main objectives against David \nMIRANDA are to understand the nature of any material he is \ncarrying, mitigate the risks to national security that this material \nposes...&quot;</i><p>Which reads like supposition to me. Based on open source research? Please.<p>Later, in paragraph 13:<p><i>&quot;The claimant’s hand luggage was examined, and items retained which as I \nhave said included encrypted storage devices. Mr Oliver Robbins, Deputy National \nSecurity Adviser for Intelligence, Security and Resilience in the Cabinet Office, \nindicates in his first witness statement (paragraph 6) that the encrypted data contained \nin the external hard drive taken from the claimant contains approximately 58,000 \nhighly classified UK intelligence documents.&quot;</i><p>Which is a very definite statement. Either it&#x27;s based on guesswork, in which case the best that could be said is that it is merely an opinion, or else they broke the encryption (TrueCrypt?). I can&#x27;t find anything in the facts section of the judgement to indicate that Miranda disclosed what he was carrying, or surrendered passwords.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/miranda-v-sofshd.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgment...</a> [PDF]",1392819459

7263648,comment,7263350,7263350,7,0,pyalot2,,,"I think there&#x27;s two problems nobody seems to be addressing about space elevators.<p>1) A vehicle starting at the earths surface has the moment of earths rotation. As it climbs the cable it would need to be accelerated to a suitable orbital momentum. If you don&#x27;t do this, then it&#x27;ll &quot;tug&quot; on the cable counter its rotation.<p>Edit: To clarify why that is a problem. The climber would be accelerated by the tension of the cable, but as that happens, the cable would be bent at the point of the climber, which might be problematic. Also the counterweight that provides the tension would be decelerated, so the whole cable would &quot;tilt&quot;. That is all, as long as the climber climbs. When it stops climbing (or is jettisoned), both counterweight and climber would now start a pendulum motion (at different frequencies). That&#x27;s probably also not good.<p>2) To reach geostationary orbit at a speed of say 100km/h would take 2 weeks. Traveling 500km/h it would still take 3 days. Unless you jettison the climber at the top, only one climber could be on the cable at any one time, and that would put a lot of strain on recovering the initial cost of building the elevator by putting an upper bound on how often you can send a climber up to anything between every 6 days to a month. I don&#x27;t think anybody would engage in a project that cost trillions of dollars to get built, and then can only send 12 missions per year into orbit.<p>Edit: People are pointing out that a second cable would solve this issue. I think it might be challenging to keep the two cables from tangling up across a tens of thousands of kilometers.",1392818807

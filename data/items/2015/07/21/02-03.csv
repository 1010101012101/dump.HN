As instructed in Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution, the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court (William Rehnquist at this time) was sworn in to preside, and the senators were sworn in as jurors.<p>Five weeks later, on February 12, the Senate voted on whether to remove Clinton from office. The president was acquitted on both articles of impeachment. The prosecution needed a two-thirds majority to convict but failed to achieve even a bare majority. Rejecting the first charge of perjury, 45 Democrats and 10 Republicans voted “not guilty,” and on the charge of obstruction of justice the Senate was split 50-50. After the trial concluded, President Clinton said he was “profoundly sorry” for the burden his behavior imposed on Congress and the American people.<p><i></i>*Yes, he did go through impeachment proceedings, but was acquitted on the articles of impeachment.<p>Sorry, should have been more clear.  It was just an example anyway.  Didn&#x27;t mean to endorse, or imply anything about Clinton, just to show how the two coarse factions I mentioned in my comment differ and impact how sex related things very often plays out.",1437447570

Generally works much better in dense air, and it makes an interesting beam weapon when you aren&#x27;t launching things with it. I read an earlier proposal which I can now not find which used the same sort of laser aggregation that the NIF was planning on using for fusion containment but as a field of smallish (10kW) lasers which could all be trained on the same target to input a bunch of heat which the target would use to convert a liquid gas into the necessary reaction mass to lift into orbit.<p>They all seem to peter out at 25 km or so. The goal with lasers was to pick a wavelength that the atmosphere was relatively transparent too but could be easily converted into heat through absorption on the receiving end. Microwaves would work to if you are careful about your wavelengths and don&#x27;t point them at satellites.",1437447158

Otherwise, I imagine I would be using them.)<p>I was thinking of switching from the default text messaging application to Hangouts, on my phone, for the sake of maintaining a history of texts that the default app will dump beyond a certain count, but after incidentally running across comments about how fucked over Hangouts apparently has become, I&#x27;m pretty much not going there.<p>Google seems to be doing fine, revenue-wise, but they are losing me as... well, I guess I&#x27;m one bit of the &quot;merchandise&quot; that forms the basis of their revenue.<p>I don&#x27;t hate Google.  And I like the initiative on security and, &quot;true names&quot; aside, privacy.

In my work, particularly in large organizations, I saw the need for something like Wave.

What if you took that time and invested it in bettering your skill sets, etc.?<p>This sort of sentence is extremely annoying to me. I&#x27;m good at several things, one of which is a video game that I&#x27;ve played for most of my life, so I&#x27;ve heard people say things like this for a good portion of my existence and it&#x27;s up there with some of my biggest pet peeves. I&#x27;ve noticed that when people say this, it&#x27;s usually a skillset that bothers them on some level, and usually for reasons that are unconscious to the person saying it.<p>No one says &quot;you could spend more time developing a valuable skillset&quot; to me regarding, say, fitness, because most people would enjoy having better bodies and the reasons for this are immediately apparent. But they&#x27;ll say this regarding a few video games I am extremely good at, even though the results of having a better body and being really good at a video game are both satisfaction on my end. You might say that fitness leads to better health, but that&#x27;s still using the assumption that health maximizes enjoyment in some way by extending the number of years you&#x27;re alive -- because no one would be parading health as a virtue if every year alive were miserable.<p>I&#x27;m sure the reasons differ, but the mentality is always the same: this thing I derive obvious satisfaction from is objectively good (&quot;bettering myself&quot;), while this thing I can&#x27;t see obvious satisfaction from (or are threatened by) is a waste of time, even if both, extended to their ultimate goal, just result in more satisfaction. It ignores that our skillsets have the same extensional goal: things we value. When you extend the purpose of your skillsets, you&#x27;re always going to end up with some sense of &quot;I value this thing.&quot;<p>Example: a lot of guys will improve their skillsets so they can get money so they can have lots of sex with women they find really attractive. But if you&#x27;re already able to do that, and that&#x27;s your primary motivation for doing that, then you&#x27;re not going to have as much of an incentive to develop that skillset. Conversely, if the skillset is intrinsically satisfying to you, you&#x27;ll eschew sex and develop it. But the goal is the same thing: maximizing your own utility from what you value.<p>You&#x27;d better a skillset, in other words, to derive more satisfaction. And since you don&#x27;t know that they don&#x27;t already have a developed skillset, since lots of people are good at many things, you don&#x27;t know how much satisfaction they already derive from their existing skillsets. So you&#x27;re just saying &quot;you should better yourself&quot; in a vacuum, which is effectively telling them that they could be deriving more satisfaction arbitrarily, even if they&#x27;re already deriving lots of satisfaction.<p>So either this ignores that you&#x27;d do these things for more satisfaction anyway, or presumes that you can tell a person you&#x27;ve never met how much they&#x27;re going to get (or should be getting) satisfaction from utilization of their skillsets, which is insanely presumptuous.",1437444894

Nobody is arguing that it should stay, but it&#x27;s important to understand WHY they are still around. Just because it&#x27;s the major standard doesn&#x27;t make a good one.<p>Ignorant? Really? I expect more constructive comments here on HN instead of running around and calling people&#x27;s comments &quot;ignorant&quot;. Perhaps you need to review the HN Guidelines [2].

I just tried to explain to you that printing money without producing more goods/services just dilutes your purchasing power. The pain caused by _moderate_ inflation is easier to hoist on unsuspecting public, so inflation is typically chosen over  bankruptcy (if you control the money printer - Greece is out of luck).<p>>there would be an accompanying increase in production.<p>Easier said than done. The US GDP has been bumping barely above 0 over the past several years, which means we are not producing more. A lot of reasons for it, but one of them is lack of consumption caused by excessive debt of consumers, who are flat out broke (and heavily in debt).",1437444212

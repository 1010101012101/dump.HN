You shut down broad classes of functionality entirely, and are required to provide all legit Javascript through <script> tags, which furthermore must come from your whitelisted sources.<p>(Actually, there are some other modes too; consult the spec for details. However, I expect this is the one people will be talking about.)<p>The article isn't exactly wrong, but it doesn't accurately convey what is going on, either. Basically, if you can discipline yourself well enough to only use included files (which isn't a terrible style anyhow), then this allows you to ensure that you won't execute injected content.<p>Is this something that you should be correctly escaping? Yes, absolutely. I am a huge advocate of that in my workplace. But I would certainly take advantage of this extra layer of protection, too, rather than rely on everybody in my company getting it all absolutely right, all the time. The problem with something like escaping is that you make one little error and you lose everything.

Our product is slowly growing and getting traction, but that's only because we don't expect to have tens of thousands of users.  Each of our users is worth more to us than the average twitter user, so we put more time into recruiting them to the site (generally it's a personal contact 50%+ of the time that gets them there).<p>So in our case, we can afford to put the time in with individual users.  We thus don't really need to integrate with existing products, because our market doesn't demand it.  In fact, in the IRDM area, I've found that almost everything is proprietary and very secretive; every company protects its trade secrets tightly (not because they are advanced or cutting edge... just because they hold on to every minor edge they can, regardless of the wisdom of doing so).  In short, it's very old school business-types who think their secret sauce is in their product rather than in their relationships and experience.<p>But I would definitely like to second the ""figure how to make it work from Email or IM or similar products others have already accepted.""

Literacy was at a sufficient level that most were able to complete the single question, which was, of course: ""How long do you think the Emperor's nose is?""<p>When the forms were collected, mathematicians added up all the values, and divided by the number of forms. Thus it was known that the length of the Emperor's nose was 6.734602 cm. The complete set of data was of course preserved, and many years later, with advances in statistical understanding more advanced mathematicians pointed out that fringe values - obviously the product of deranged minds - were distorting the honest opinions of the rest, and by eliminating them and using the very latest numerical modelling techniques, the mathematicians corrected this value to 4.980403 cm.

If he hates his job then fine he can change that but if he hates his life(which I would assume since he wants to change it) then changing jobs is lip stick on a pig.  Perhaps he just needs a new hobby?<p>>The problem is, he does not really know what could that be and feels completely lost.<p>Well when completely lost the first thing to do is stop moving and figure out where you are.  Put together a list of skills everything from tying his shoes to painting the mona lisa(and perhaps rate them from good to bad).  Figure out how he feels about the skills he does have. Use these to determine things he finds interesting.  Now attempt to do these things in a non commited  manner but with an eye towards doing it professionally(don't play video games and then say I am going to be a game developer).  Be wary of new car smell(something seems good because it is new and exciting.)  Talk to people who actually do it about their experiences.  From here make larger investments in the field: training, credentials needed etc.",1254776771

Is it expensive in itself, given the damage it does to your credit rating? Well, yes, but that doesn't mean it's not there, or sometimes the best choice. Should you not have ended up in the position where that was the best choice? Well, yes, but if that's where you are, that's where you are.<p>It's important to separate the ideal fact that you shouldn't be in that position from the practical fact that it is indeed an option.",1254776735

You'll have to spell it out a little more carefully than that for me to understand you, as that sentence alone makes no logical sense to me.<p>I don't think they, or the author, are so far down the rabbit hole as to imply anything like that.  What they are implying is more rational, but still, in my opinion, is wrong.",1254776692

I agree with you that Digg is a great product for the niche it is serving. That's why it is successful.

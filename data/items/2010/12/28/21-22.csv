It's higher for reading than for math, because kids in high-SES families spend much more time reading at home than they spend doing math at home. And even for literacy it depends on what you're measuring, e.g. it's different for vocabulary knowledge than for reading comprehension.<p>The reason I linked to the 1969 paper is that it was the first of its kind, so the easiest way to find the more recent research is to look for papers that cite it. A quick glance at their research shows that upwards of 80% of the variance in their reading metrics was due to differences in how students spent the four summer vacations. This isn't taking into account either the initial gap (100% from home differences) or the fact that home differences effect progress made during the year. Basically the amount of variance due to home differences is definitely over 90%, but there isn't enough information from this study to put an exact number on it.<p>Basically the only two things that have changed since 1969 are that A) poor people are much poorer and B) schools for poor people are worse. I don't know offhand how these two factors balance each other out, but I'd guess that overall the numbers are pretty similar.",1293573331

2046912,comment,2042717,2046765,0,0,applicative,,,"It will infer you mean Integer if you just evaluate it, read what it says about "":set +t"".  Crudely put, `:t foo` puts a question to the interpeter that is about the expression ""foo"" - ""in what sense can this expression be taken?"" -- it would be tiresome but maybe a little clearer if `:t` demanded quotes.  If you just ask it what 5 or (4 + 1) or 2+2+1 is, it will say that it is 5 and assume that we were talking about an `Integer` -- the command `:t it` gives the type it is associating with the sign it is exhibiting to you as the result of calculation or evaluation, the second sign, not the one you entered.<p>In the type query `:t 5`, ghci doesn't have to decide or resolve anything, it gives all the possibilities, `5: Num a => a`.  But if it is to evaluate the expression it needs you or it to make decisions.  You can see this pretty clearly in the following:<p><pre><code>     Prelude> :t 5\n     5 :: (Num t) => t\n     Prelude> 5\n     5\n     Prelude> :t it\n     it :: Integer\n     Prelude> 5 :: Float\n     5.0\n     Prelude> :m + Data.Ratio\n     Prelude Data.Ratio> 5 :: Rational\n     5 % 1\n     Prelude Data.Ratio> :t it\n     it :: Rational\n</code></pre>\nIn the first case, it decided, in the other two, I decided what type I meant.<p>I'm not sure I grasp everything about this, but in your example, `p [1,2,3,4,5]` ghci couldn't make its natural assumption - i.e. the one you in fact think should be it's natural assumption -- since no Monoid (in your sense) instance had been declared for its preferred case, Integer, so it backed off and demanded clarification.<p>You had unconsciously over-ruled the defaults you wanted. As has been pointed out, if you had realized that Integer is the name for Haskell's integer type, and Int a dirty approximation like Float, and had used it, everything would have gone as you claim to have wanted. In fact you get everything you want if you just add these lines to your module:<p><pre><code>    instance Monoid Integer\n        where\n          addId = 0\n          add = (+)\n</code></pre>\n<i>keeping all of the other Int stuff intact</i>.  Then in ghci can use its defaults -- the defaults you want -- and you get:<p><pre><code>    Ok, modules loaded: Main.\n    *Main> p [1,2,3,4,5]\n    (5x^4 + 4x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1)\n    *Main> :t it\n    it :: UnivariatePolynomial Integer\n</code></pre>\nThough of course the <i>unevaluated</i> expression is given a more general type:<p><pre><code>    *Main> :t  p [1,2,3,4,5]\n    p [1,2,3,4,5] :: (Num t, Monoid t) => \n                       UnivariatePolynomial t\n</code></pre>\n-- and rightly, since this very module permits an Int interpretation of the expression.  In a case that goes against its defaults, I have to tell it that that's how I want the complex functional expression to be understood, before I ask for evaluation:<p><pre><code>    *Main> p [1,2,3,4,5] :: UnivariatePolynomial Int\n    (5x^4 + 4x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1)\n     *Main> :t it\n     it :: UnivariatePolynomial Int\n\n</code></pre>\nIt is the same if you add another Monoid instance for the non-default reading of ""1"", e.g.<p><pre><code>    instance Monoid Float\n        where\n          addId = 0\n          add = (+)\n</code></pre>\nThis can exist side by side with the others.  Then you get:<p><pre><code>     *Main> p [1,2,3,4,5] :: UnivariatePolynomial Float\n     (5.0x^4 + 4.0x^3 + 3.0x^2 + 2.0x + 1.0)\n     *Main> :t it\n     it :: UnivariatePolynomial Float\n</code></pre>\nNote that even with three Monoid instances in play in the module, we still get what you wanted:<p><pre><code>    *Main> p [1,2,3,4,5] \n    (5x^4 + 4x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1)\n    *Main> :t it\n    it :: UnivariatePolynomial Integer</code></pre>",1293572364

What most analyses like this ignore to too great a degree, and what most of the more than 100 comments posted here so far aren't focusing a lot on is how much provision of government-operated schooling costs in the United States compared to what it costs in other countries. By most reasonable standards of comparison, United States schools provide less learning added to learners per dollar of inputs than most schools in quite a few other OECD countries. That's apparent whether one looks at a variety of comparisons of mathematics achievement (a crucial educational goal), or second-language achievement (a goal often neglected in the English-speaking United States), or in science achievement (a safeguard against irrational public policies). Having grown up in the United States, and having lived overseas for two separate three-year spans, the second one with my children, I can't be complacent about the provision of government-operated schools in the United States.",1293572266

Most cable news networks don't easily distinguish between news and opinion reporting since both are regularly done by the same people.<p>So your argument is: ""Most people don't realize that there's a difference between opinion and reporting, so there isn't one.""? I don't accept that people can't distinguish, and even if true, I don't accept that it makes any difference in the truth.<p>There is also a difference between real new organizations -- viz. print -- and cable news. Even on Fox News, however (note: I don't watch cable news frequently, I'm assuming this is still the case), their opinion shows are clearly separate from their actual reporting. O'Reilly, Hannity, Fox and Friends all discuss the news but aren't reporting it.<p>> Again we're focusing on Julian Assange. While there is a story to be written about him, that story is easy and lazy. The far harder story is to actually investigate the cables.<p>Forgive me, but, It's a bit offensive to the reporters at the New Yorker, or the Times, or the NYT to imply that such a story is easy and lazy. You make it sound like the two stories are mutually exclusive and it's not as it the cables themselves are being ignored by anyone.<p>> The rape accusations against him (while serious and perhaps true) do not change the information contained therein.

If Obama were accused of rape and tried to pass DADT, you can bet it would be reported on too.

There were definite wrongs that needed to be fixed (segregation being the prime example), but in the process of fixing them we inadvertently damaged key aspects of our societal structure.  I think that this happened because of the way our culture lumps together completely unrelated positions into strongly correlated groupings that we label ""conservative"" and ""liberal.""  As a modern example, consider the fact that people's positions on gun control, abortion, and taxes all tend to correlate very strongly in our country, even though all three are orthogonal (libertarians being an example of people who buck this trend to some degree).  In the '60s and '70s, bad things like racism got lumped in with many of the good things we collectively label as ""family values,"" to the point where many of the people fighting against the bad stuff saw the good parts as being part and parcel.<p>This carries over today: my most liberal friends consider ""family values"" to be an ugly euphemism for ""racism,"" ""homophobia,"" and ""misogyny.""  They don't make any distinction for the good parts like ""get married before you have kids,"" and ""marriage is a serious and important commitment which requires a lifetime of compromise and sacrifice.""  They think that the bad parts are inherent aspects of the culture, which implies that the only way to get rid of them is to radically change the entire culture.  I've even read positions more extreme than those of my friends: people who think the parts I label good, like the institution of marriage, to be part of the problem.",1293570518

The biggest thing that I hear from teachers in NZ is that the Ministry of Ed is doing its best, through a variety of stupid policies regarding untested National Standards for primary school kids, to demote teachers from being education professionals to mere technicians.  Teachers have survived for years educating a lot of people with freedom to adapt their delivery of education how they see fit.  Now, however, under pressure from all sides to be ""accountable"" (not real accountability, but performance destroying, lip-service style accountability) teachers are being destroyed as independent professionals as the bureaucracy crushes and bows to political will.<p>The biggest problem with this political will is that applying pressure to the teachers is politically easy.  They get all this holiday, they just play with kids all day ""how easy is their job??? zomg"" /sarcasm.  The real problems with most bad kids start at home and are best addressed with some sort of intervention from the very beginning of the kids life from social workers monitoring the family home and environment and various other early stage policies designed to create and mentor the parents into raising a good child, not a drain on society.  But supposedly, policies like this ,which are normally far more effective than simple standardised testing, are ""socialism"" and therefore bad.",1293570395

2046785,comment,2045684,2046240,0,0,driax,,,"Pyramid is actually pretty much a fork of repoze.bfg with some minor changes that allow Pylons developers easier porting. Essentially repoze.bfg were newer than Pylons (and therefor learned a lot). It incorporated more flexiblity while being simpler in design. This flexibility also means that a lot of what TurboGears 2 implemented ontop of Pylons isn't needed anymore, Pyramid allows you to use idioms common to both Pylons and TurboGears 2.<p>Additional Pylons were designed as a lot of WSGI middlewares pulled together. Pyramid is not (so much). The repoze.bfg developer so that Pylons developers had already settled on a common configuration of core middleware, and thus made many of the common middlewares required and therefore more tightly integrated.<p>So while Pylons were very much a meta-framework, Pyramid is not as much.<p>I'm unsure about what Turbogears developer exactly wants to do, but there simply isn't as much need for a monolithic framework ontop of Pyramid since it itself is somewhat monolithic and flexible enough to allow extension through libraries. Instead what probably will happen is that a lot of all the extra libraries already built as part of Turbogears 2 will be reworked to work as libaries for Pyramid (not on top of it). (but all of the is conjecture)<p>Note. I follow the mail-list much don't really participate in the development of any of these projects.",1293570254

The original meaning of ""otaku"" not only includes ""someone else's house"" - it can also be used to politely refer to the person you're addressing.<p>It spread from there, first into print media geared towards the otaku (though it didn't go by that name yet) community and then into use by the community at large.

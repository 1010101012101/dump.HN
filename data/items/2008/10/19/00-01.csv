336791,comment,336556,336770,0,0,netcan,,,"There is a problem with the type of ideal you describe.<p>If (as previous comments suggest) libertarian ideal is something that only works in its entirety, then introducing a 'libertarian law' outside of a libertarian system is damaging. It may be a step towards the completion of you ideal in a very general way, but if it doesn't get you closer to it, doesn't improve the intermediary state etc. etc. , then it's not a good law.",1224377782
336790,comment,336455,336497,0,0,hugh,,,"The Freudian model isn't simpler: it postulates three ""selves"" with constant, fixed agendas. This model talks about arbitrary numbers of selves with arbitrary agendas which pop into existence all the time.<p>The ""short term self"" vs ""long term self"" conflict is unlike the id vs ego conflict in that there isn't a ""superego"" to adjudicate it. The no-superego model fits better with my subjective experiences.<p>Of course the ""long term self"" and ""short term self"" are themselves composed of multiple selves... for instance I have one long-term self who is working towards one set of goals, and another who is working towards another set of semi-contradictory goals.",1224377743
336789,comment,336556,336690,0,0,netcan,,,"Actually I think yters deals with your sort of complaint. He deals with it fatalistically. Libertarians will continue to say that libertarianism never had a clear shot. Communists will continue to say the same. Both are not particularly easy to test. This argument is stuck when you encounter this.<p>But we do have a situation that is not high level theory that we need to make a decision about: We can push Governments to be more/less liberation, elect libertarian politicians etc. etc. What are the likely consequences of these actions assuming that an imperfect world exists where there will be opposition from politicians of different opinions etc.",1224377475

336787,comment,336556,336678,0,0,walterk,,,"Being something of a utilitarian myself, I see intervention being necessary when market incentives are not aligned with what's best for society.  I've never seen anybody make a convincing case that such misalignments do not exist, or that a free market is always able to account for them more efficiently than the state.<p>EDIT: Feel free to make such a case or link to one. I'd <i>like</i> to be proven wrong.",1224377236

336783,comment,336556,336675,0,0,netcan,,,"I agree that this proves nothing. I agree that the US financial system or market in general was never free in a sense that would appease a libertarian but..<p>Your sentiments are interestingly similar to what a lot of Marxists/Communists had to say (not too many left though) when that 'failed':<p>That is, point to the Soviet Union & say: 'That was never true communism. So it failed. If it was truly a Marxist regime, this never would have happened.'<p>As I said, I wouldn't personally take this as a 'proof' of anything. But what seems inevitable is that this is causing a swing (in public opinion) away from deregulation of financial markets. I think it's very likely that there'll be a wholesale swing against the suite of things associated with 'libertarianism.' That's a shame in a way. Whether or not financial regulatory policies are optimal or not, has very little to do with the moral theories of libertarianism for example.<p>Anyway, there seems to be a big shift in the sway these ideas hold.",1224376857
336782,comment,336694,336694,0,0,pedalpete,,,"This doesn't seem so much to be 'What if the US Collapses' as 'How the US is like the USSR and why that will lead to a similar collapse'.<p>However, the USSR was not a free-market system, and there was very little incentive it seemed for citizens of the USSR to band together and solve problems.<p>Are there similarities between the US and pre-collapse USSR, sure. But the human mind is great at finding similarities and patterns. Postulating that the US will collapse JUST as the USSR did is a stretch.<p>The US may fall from it's height of power relative to other nations of the world, but a full collapse in the near term I think is unlikely.<p>Of course, every empire falls at some point, and I suspect we have seen the height of American power, but the American way of life is far from over.<p>By the way, I'm Canadian!",1224376832

But you’re pushing compromise as an ideal and that’s just wrong.<p>An ideal is an ideal and compromise is what people do to make their ideals compatible and create an actual system of government.<p>So what you want comes out in the process because, as you said, a society run by politicians is going to be interventionist by its very nature and people with Libertarian ideas are going to have to compromise.  But if the people with Libertarian ideals don’t come to the table firm in their own beliefs they end up compromising even more than they normally would.<p>Which (bringing it back to the housing bubble) is exactly how we ended up in this situation.  People with libertarian views were willing to compromise to the point where what actually got implemented is the polar opposite of libertarianism and the result was disaster.",1224375198

Alex has made his choice, now he's trying to force it on others as if it is in fact gospel.<p>I don't care what people call me. I don't care personally that Alex slammed my business. <i>I</i> know what I'm doing is right for me, because I get to reap the rewards every day.<p>But what I do care about is that this further stifles the discussion of choice. There is so little presented about bootstrapping. There are so few role models. It's an information wasteland, like I wrote in ""Drawing Back the Curtain"":<p><a href=""http://unicornfree.com/2011/drawing-back-the-curtain/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unicornfree.com/2011/drawing-back-the-curtain/</a><p>Most people don't realize that ""tech business"" and ""funded startup"" aren't the same thing. Most people truly believe that they couldn't start a company on the side. They may believe that they are a caged lion because they have a job (as per your metaphor [1]), but that there is nothing for them between being a caged lion forever and having to have some kind of earth-shattering idea that will get funded by somebody so they can develop it full time just to see where it goes.<p>THAT is what Justin Vincent is railing against: the lack of choice, the ""soaking in it"" issue, the conflation of ""tech business"" and ""funded startup"". The lack of apparent choice. That's what I write against, too.<p>Justin never wrote about ""This is what you should do,"" he said ""This is what you see everywhere but look, there's a totally different way."" Alex, on the other hand, slammed my work as an individual. And told us all that merely seeking happiness is not enough for the world, because he's a secular humanist.<p>Tack-y. Chilling effect. Just like labeling somebody else's business a ""lifestyle business"" just because it is bootstrapped.<p>That is the core problem: the attempt to discredit anyone who does things differently. The attempt to stomp out anyone trying to pull the ""norm"" over from one extreme. Labeling -- such as ""oh, that's just a lifestyle business"" -- is a way of trying to shut down the discussion.<p>And witnessing THAT behavior is why everyone is so engaged.<p>[1] By the way, if we're talking about matters of identity... caged lion?

2344594,story,,,1,2,chaosprophet,"Ask HN: A completely e-mail based support helpdesk",,"Hi,<p>Reading the recent thread about the launch of Freshdesk from a HN comment made me go back and read that entire HN thread. While thinking about what a better helpdesk system would be like, I remembered a line in a recent post from Paras Chopra of Visual Website Optimizer, wondering how to cut time on support.<p>So here's my theory:\nEarly stage startups typically can't afford to have dedicated support guys, so they usually have one of the founders or the developers doing support also. Also, a founder/developer (in such a startup) typically has much better ways to spend his time, than answering support requests. So what if there is a support helpdesk which acts entirely through email?<p>Imagine:\nWhen a support request is sent to support@foo.baz, the email is read, automatically categorized depending on predefined categories, tagged, indexed, and then assigned to a particular person depending on predefined criteria. An email is then fired off to that person with it's content being the original text of the support request, a list of 5 similar support requests previously handled (numbered 1 to 5), and the actions performed and responses given to those previous requests.<p>The developer can then simply reply with a command verb such as 'reply 3' to tell the support desk that the same response as the third request in the suggested list should be sent back to the user. Or, if none of the suggested responses match, they can simply type out a new response to that request. Or, if they are working on some crazy awesome new feature, they could simply reply with 'reassign' and the system would reassign the request to another person and send them the same email. The responses are then indexed and tagged and sent back out to the user who first asked the question.<p>This way developers/founders answering support don't have to deal with clunky interfaces, and they can save time by quickly responding to a query without having to search through a knowledge base or something similar. I realise that this is probably not the way you would want to handle support as your company grows, so there would be easy ways to export all your data for use with some other service too.<p>So what do you guys think of such a system? Does it already exist? If not, is there a good reason it doesn't already exist? Most importantly, would you use such a service? Why or why not? Also, how much would you be willing to pay for such a service on a monthly basis?<p>Regards,<p>chaosprophet",1300565591

How much time will it take in the worst case? How much in the best case? How much in the average case? Can you improve on this?""<p>These follow-up questions, and the fluency with which the candidate navigates them, are actually the point of the exercise. Well, that and to learn whether or not you're talking to someone who can't properly state <i>any</i> algorithm, and to help gauge your candidate's level of primadonnatude.

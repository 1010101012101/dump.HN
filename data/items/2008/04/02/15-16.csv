Just go verify for yourself - you will find entire books there.<p>Yes, YouTube has established a ""role model"" here, but just because they got away with it - at least dumped any potential legal problems on Google - doesn't make it <i>right</i>. Google could still be held liable and it is <i>certainly</i> the case that YouTube has turned a blind eye to large scale copyright infringement.<p>I get the gnawing feeling that way too many start-ups are in this mode of ""Let's see what we can get away with"".

153082,comment,153000,153001,0,0,thorax,,,"Quick feedback:<p>* I like the idea. Reminds me of Google's CSE tools, but with individual crawling control.<p>* I think you need to proofread the text on the main page a bit. Some of it doesn't parse correctly for me, for example: ""You decide what sites to crawl indexed and search""<p>* A lot of your links on the right are 404 or missing.<p>* Your signup form does not accept emails with a ""+"" in them. So I cannot signup with my default email address. Please resolve this if you can.<p>* So the crawler itself has to be a local app? In other words, my local computer is doing the crawling? I had assumed the service was that your site would do the crawling based on the information I provided and on the schedule I wanted.<p>Seems like an interesting project, but you do need to work on the user-facing aspects a little to prevent people from being confused.<p>The layout is pretty unprofessional, so it doesn't encourage me to want to download an EXE client to run locally.",1207151012

153076,comment,140553,151346,0,0,jsmcgd,,,"OK. I agree that Facebook doesn't play well with anyone else. Not meaning to be contentious but I'm not sure if this can be classed as a failing us.<p>I have to strongly disagree that their implementations of existing functions are half-assed. I, and many people I know, communicate more with Facebook's messaging service than email service.<p>I would also argue that the user experience is considerably better than performing the same communications via email clients such as Gmail. Their photo sharing service is also highly adequate for my and other's needs. I have never considered creating a Flickr account because on the whole I think the centralization of features by Facebook outweighs any benefits provided by additional features in Flickr.<p>Perhaps you view these Facebook features as superfluous however for me they are the reason I use Facebook so much. I deliberately decide to message my friends using Facebook instead of email. I deliberately log in to Facebook to see if any of my friends have posted any new photos. The supposedly core features of Facebook like the profile and the wall are things that I rarely use.<p>I have a feeling that we may be 'violently' agreeing with each other.",1207150603

153062,comment,151390,152289,0,0,jules,,,"After having read a few pages category theory somehow seems similar to OOP. As with OOP you package data with its operations (morphisms).<p>> Quoting Asperti and Longo [1]: “The basic premise of category theory\nis that every kind of mathematically structured object comes equipped with a notion of\n[ . . . ] transformation, called ‘morphism’, that preserves the structure of the object.” By\nmeans of the categorical language one cannot express properties of the internal structure\nof objects. The internal structure of objects is accessible only externally through the\nmorphisms between the objects.<p>What is described here sounds a lot like information hiding/encapsulation.

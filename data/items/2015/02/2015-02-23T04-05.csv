    subset Wday of Day where M .. F;
</code></pre>
Currently Rakudo does not treat any subsets as static types.<p>> So what are dynamic types?<p>Subsets that aren&#x27;t (treated as) static are (treated as) dynamic subsets and are thus treated as dynamic types. These are the <i>only</i> dynamic types.<p>> Which code avoids dynamic types and hence is fully type-checked at compile time?<p>All &quot;untyped&quot; code. Scalar containers ($foo, @bar[1], @bar[2] etc.) and values are assigned the static type Any. Of course this is pretty trivial but it is type checking and it does happen at compile-time. :)<p>Most if not all the code in the core libraries.<p>Most of the code in the ecosystem.<p>----<p>I&#x27;d appreciate correction or wholesale destruction of any wrong ideas in the above.

Your suggestion that they are and a far drawn remark that it relates to the oppression faced by blacks/jews is an appeal to extremes and is a logical fallacy.</i><p>Why is it an appeal to extremes?  Not all racial prejudice or violence is extreme.  My original point was that we should apply the same standards to claims about tech workers as we would about racial stereotypes, that is, to view them critically and demand evidence.<p><i>#2 : In the real world, people conduct violence against others all the time for varied reasons. Just because you have a well paying job doesn&#x27;t make you immune.</i><p>This is a view of mine that you have invented.  I never said tech workers should be immune from the real world, but rather that inciting violence is always wrong, and is wrong in this case.  Would you tell middle class gays that they are not immune from the real world, and need to deal with violence from people who don&#x27;t like them?<p><i>#3 : The left/right/center .. Has nothing to do w/ this matter. If you&#x27;re an asshole, someone might...</i><p>You can&#x27;t just rationalize violence so easily.  I&#x27;m not saying it doesn&#x27;t exist, or that tech workers deserve special protections not afforded to others.  But just because worse things happen to other people, doesn&#x27;t make violence against tech workers ok.  People who face real struggles and adversity probably find White middle class feminists to be cry baby&#x27;s too, but that doesn&#x27;t mean these feminists have nothing to complain about.<p>I don&#x27;t need any lesson in how to live my life, I live a life consistent with my views which are different to yours.  You see value in the grittiness of people&#x27;s lives outside the White middle class.

I never said that &quot;women only care about social validation&quot;. Is it wrong to say that more women frown upon occupations that are seen to be held by social pariahs and outcasts by society at large? Why would an ambitious woman be interested in becoming what&#x27;s seen as an educated plumber or janitor when she can aspire to become a respected high level, finance executive or powerful lawyer instead? imo it&#x27;s more common sense rather than misogyny.<p>Also some sweeping gender statements are actually true, such as men being more prone to violence than women.<p>&quot;Second, that&#x27;s sweeping under the rug the constant discrimination against women that is keeping them out of our industry.&quot;<p>I agree that there&#x27;s a ton of discrimination against women in the tech industry. But really how of this discrimination keeps women from actually joining our fields? Your argument would make more sense if there were a lot of women entering AND then leaving, but that doesn&#x27;t happen. Few actually even try entering our field. Look at the military. While things are slowly changing, there are few environments more toxic to women than the military&#x27;s male dominated, authoritarian atmosphere (gender discrimination is horrible, but rape that isn&#x27;t prosecuted and punished is much worse); the tech industry isn&#x27;t even close to being as bad. This is pretty well known to society at large, yet there are more women joining the military (and then leaving) than there are women joining the tech industry; which leads me to believe that the general social perception of our field is just horrible when the even armed forces are beating us at female recruitment. Now let&#x27;s look at finance. The average wage gap in the financial industry for genders is the worst compared to other industries (about $0.70 to a $1), investment banks have the reputation of being &#x27;frat houses&#x27;, and yet more women enter finance than our industry. imo gender discrimination isn&#x27;t as strong of a force for deterring women from entering a field. Gender discrimination is much stronger at affecting how long women stay active and how far they can rise within a field.<p>Historically there&#x27;s been a ton of discrimination against women in pretty much every field. I feel that the sectors that already got &#x27;fixed&#x27; (i.e. somewhat better than before) were the ones where large numbers of women have entered due to interest (i.e. politics, healthcare, business, legal). Those women were well aware of the toxic environment, but the interest level was so high they joined anyway.

That complexity must be expressed in full in any program which performs that task correctly, whether in terms of language/library constructions or the ways in which those are combined. When the tools with which you implement a task (here, C and the core Unix API) are structured substantially differently than the high-level concepts of which that task is composed, there is additional complexity inherent to mapping those concepts.<p>In light of that, I don&#x27;t understand what you mean by, &quot;complexity itself is a sin,&quot; unless you&#x27;re referring specifically to the strictly unnecessary complexity introduced by a sub-optimal mapping of high-level semantics to core constructs. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the kind of complexity we&#x27;re seeing here. I think we&#x27;re seeing the complexity inherent to mapping shell-level semantics to C semantics and the semantics of the Unix API, specifically error-handling semantics.<p>I agree with jws that what this code demonstrates is that the core Unix API is difficult to use for writing precisely correct high-level programs, even ones as simple as echo. I feel that this is exactly why it&#x27;s important that <i>core</i> high-level programs like echo encapsulate as much of the complexity of mapping to C as possible (that is, in the style of GNU rather than SysV): so that one can easily write reliable programs with high-level tools like the shell without worrying about that complexity.",1424666189

The comment you so rudely dismissed made an excellent point. Misogyny is a deep-rooted problem in our society, not just the tech world, and has been for quite some time. This is evidenced by the fact that some of the worst discrimination against women comes from other women. Dismissive name calling will only lead to complaining. Only through understanding will we achieve progress.<p>We need to examine why we&#x27;re creating work environments that benefit aggressive personalities. In my job as an engineering manager, I&#x27;ve had to coach two male engineers to be more influential across the organization. This journey has been hard for them since they&#x27;re the quintessential type-B personalities that are most happy simply getting their work done. But it&#x27;s been made abundantly clear to me that they cannot advance beyond the Staff level without becoming more vocal leaders. I know this journey well since I&#x27;ve had to force myself into the same unnatural tendencies.<p>It frustrates me to hear stories like the one we&#x27;re responding to. Women complaining about being shut out of discussions? I had the same thing happen and for quite some time and I had to constantly ask my manager why I wasn&#x27;t included in certain meetings. Over time, I started getting invited to more. I&#x27;ve realized that getting my due promotions has required me to be somewhat of an asshole. I don&#x27;t think my workplace, a large enterprise software company, is uncommon and that&#x27;s a huge problem. Women complaining about being paid less for the same work? I&#x27;ve witnessed about 100 salary negotiations in my time as a manager and every female prospect has either undervalued herself or caved much too easily whereas most male prospects know their value and fight for it.<p>I think we can all agree that the outcomes, when women are underpaid, overlooked and made to feel unwelcome, need to change. But the processes that lead to those outcomes are incredibly complex and oversimplifying them does an incredible disservice. These issues are incredibly nuanced and when people like you deny that, you prevent the discussions that might lead to the understanding that is our only hope of remedying the situation.",1424664941

When the targets emerged from the building, the human would select and prioritize them similar to how people interact with games like Starcraft, and a CV system would begin tracking them. When the human hits &quot;go&quot;, the computer system would make a shooting plan that it thinks maximizes the probability of achieving the goal, and would aim and fire the gun as appropriate. To me it seems possible that several people could be hit before they even hear the first reports.<p>Or more generally, human in charge of selection and prioritizing, CV system in charge of aiming and firing. I think it&#x27;s not super crazy to think that someone might be sitting in an armored vehicle, steering the vehicle with WASD, tagging targets with a mouse.<p>Stuff like this sucks! But it seems inevitable because it&#x27;d be so effective.",1424664197

Relying too much on logic or rationality will thus be a barrier to social advancement. In other words, it doesn&#x27;t matter how right you are; if what you say makes people feel bad, that&#x27;s ll they&#x27;ll remember.<p>- The more vociferously people express their opinions about some external issue, the more likely it is that they&#x27;re talking about themselves.<p>- Pay less attention to the news. If it&#x27;s really important you&#x27;ll hear about it anyway.

It was important to them, so they did what it took to become famous. Being good at something is a small part of that, small enough that famous people aren’t usually all that good. Their time was better spent becoming famous. (This is the biggest lesson from this list. It basically implies that you can ignore people who have blogs and podcasts. Seek out the unknown experts in your field.)<p>Don’t make decisions based on money. Don’t stay at a job because the shares might be worth something, or because the company might get acquired.

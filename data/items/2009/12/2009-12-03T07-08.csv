973927,comment,972248,973682,0,0,gruseom,,,"The automatic distaste in our industry for things that are old is a disease, a form of vanity. Old ideas are not inadequate because they are old. Most great ideas are old. Sometimes, of course, an old thing is a vestige of some ancient limitation that no longer applies. Those ones are good to clear away. But the prevailing thought process in the software industry, no less dominant for its astonishing primitivity, is to reject the old <i>per se</i>. The will to novelty is so extreme that it doesn't matter if the new thing is worse, only that it is newer. We want to program in new languages like we want to drive new cars (a bad analogy in Common Lisp's case, unless you assume that the older car is both faster and more fuel efficient). Lisp in general, and Common Lisp in particular, is up against this dynamic. You can't understand the reactions to it without accounting for that.<p>That CL contains TAGBODY is a brilliant thing. It amazes me that a language can be at once so high-level and so low-level. I haven't had occasion to use it yet, but the fact that it's there, and that the higher-level abstractions are built in terms of it, is a thing of beauty to me. (I don't know about PROGV.)",1259827172

973920,comment,973803,973803,0,0,drusenko,,,"From a startup company's perspective (hiring a web developer):<p>- Any effort you make to show interest in the company goes a long way. Use the software, come prepared to talk about what you did/didn't like, and have questions for me. Are you interested in working here? Then you should be full of questions!<p>- Have a personal home page. Doesn't have to be flashy, but it should suit its purpose. An appealing website is nice (it says, I have some design taste, and I can do basic design tasks on my own), a sparse website can also communicate something (here is a list of my impressive projects, I am very technically knowledgeable). If you can combine both, even better! :)<p>- Work on cool stuff. This is the #1 differentiator (and it's all about differentiation). If you have 3 links to something really neat you worked on in the last 3 years, that places you well above most other candidates -- it shows that you love what you do.<p>- Be excited! I know you're probably nervous (most people in interviews are, and hey, your interviewer might be too), but get yourself excited about the job, and show it. Startups need enthusiasm and commitment, and this is a great way to show that you're going to be someone who ups the energy level.<p>You'd be surprised how many people fail here on some basics. Getting hired is a differentiation game. Your resume doesn't get you an interview (it can only prevent you from getting one). A short email along the following lines places you in the top 90% of candidates who apply:<p>""Hi [company person],<p>Josh [mutual friend] sent me your job listing for a web developer, and as I was reading it I kept thinking that it sounded like a perfect match.<p>I'll be graduating from [school name] this spring and am currently looking for a full-time position. I've been following [company name] for a while and love what you guys do.<p>I've attached my resume, but even more importantly, you might want to check out some of the projects I've been working on recently: [really cool project 1], [really cool project 2], [really cool project 3].<p>Feel free to call me anytime at [cell], or email me back.<p>Looking forward to hearing back from you.<p>[name]""",1259826687
973919,comment,973803,973803,0,0,Dav3xor,,,"I interviewed 2 recent college grads about a year ago, and they both had the same problem.  Both had a demo they had made (this was for someone to help with OpenGL work), and seemed to be reasonably competent and intelligent.<p>What I worry about most is whether someone will be easy to work with.  I assume most people have made it through the resume sorting process by the time they get to me (I'm just an engineer were I work, we're a small company, the boss did the initial vetting).<p>They were both so worried about making a good impression, I couldn't get them to open up and talk to me.  I couldn't tell if they had a sense of humor, or if they were flexible enough to learn something new quickly, or anything else really.<p>So, my advice..  BE YOURSELF.  Write a resume that reflects who you are, This will make you attractive to people who would want to hire you.  When you interview, just BE YOURSELF.  If you are goofy, let it show.  Talk about your enthusiasms, show that you aren't a cookie cutter job applicant.  Stick out...<p>You don't want to work for someone that doesn't want to hire you, it'll make you miserable.  I've had several really cool jobs (911 dispatching software, glass panel cockpit displays, digital music encoding/distribution, designing paper airplanes...), and I got all of them because I went in to the interview knowing that the guy doing the hiring interviewed me because he could think of me as someone he could work with from my resume, and we 'clicked' when we met in person.<p>Everyone is going to give you a list of things you should/shouldn't do in resumes and interviews, but except for the obviously universal ones (spelling/grammar/personal hygiene...) these lists are full of exceptions and personal taste.  Do what YOU think is the right thing, this will innately sell you to the kind of people that you want to work for.<p>One of my previous bosses is a regular on here, he's probably going to laugh himself silly if he reads this (I wasn't always the best employee once I got hired -- but that's another story...)<p>Good Luck!",1259826365

To the customer who values the item (Wii/Sporting Event/whatever) over the (inflated) cost, it is a net gain, not a loss.  To the person who doesn't value it above the asking price, they don't have to pay, and they don't have to get the item.<p>I bought my Wii for an inflated price on eBay and I have no regrets about it. I have a friend who bought her Wii at an even more inflated price (almost double the asking price, if I remember correctly), and she also had no qualms about it.<p>Furthermore, scalpers who wait in line for hours to buy tickets/game systems, and then flip it for profit are essentially providing a paid service to those who are too impatient, late, or otherwise incapable of buying said items when they go on sale, knowing that there is a limited supply that will not meet all the demand.",1259825795

When watching Gary Bernhardt's refactoring session, he was using text editing operations to refactor. Text editing operations aren't an effective basis for refactorings.

It sometimes appears that Y has its particular business model anyway: basically an attractive and ready product in which they can invest at a very low price and then just take it by the hand, polish it a bit and introduce it to their contacts in order to get a good valuation through either funding or sale and hence a significant return on their investment. Nothing wrong with that as long as one realizes it. Maybe one should just copy that business model - as some have done already anyway.",1259825248
973898,comment,973803,973803,0,0,ghotli,,,"Recently I interviewed roughly twenty candidates for a software development position. There were a handful of recurring things the candidates did that bothered me.<p>If given a programming problem, don't stand/sit quietly while you work out the solution. Give the interviewer some insight to your thought processes. It would be nice if you could answer the question correctly. What would be best is if you can express to me that you're going to try different approaches to solve a problem when you hit a roadblock.<p>If you need help and it is offered, take it. Quite a few candidates got very close to the solutions but were too stubborn to accept help when it was offered. That sealed the deal on me not hiring a handful of people.<p>If you really don't know the answer to a technical question just give it your best shot. Admit that's all you've got and ask the interviewer how he would solve the problem. What I'm looking for in that situation is that you can show me honesty and that you are genuinely interested in learning that which you don't currently understand.<p>If you wrote your own resume, have it edited and cut down to size by someone completely non technical. Less is more as far as resumes are concerned.<p>Be prepared to answer ad hoc questions based upon things you put in your resume that you profess to be an expert in. For example, if you put Javascript on your resume instead of just jQuery or some other framework I'm going to ask you about the prototype, variable scope, and closures in the language.<p>Quite a few candidates just stared blankly near the end of the interview when I asked them if they had any questions for us. Ask questions about the technologies we use and why. Ask us what hard problems we've had to overcome. Engage with us, your future coworkers.<p>Smile. Be sure to smile.",1259825173

973894,comment,973803,973833,0,0,potatolicious,,,"It's about differentiation.<p>Sure, you're looking to get hired for your code chops - and your employer is looking to hire you for your code chops, but in a sea of new grads something has to make you stand out. Given that traditionally hackers have been very bad at design, UI, and aesthetics, being one who <i>isn't</i> blind to these virtues is very valuable indeed.<p>And image is everything, especially when trying to get hired.<p>I think the submitter is off to a good start - he doesn't portray himself as the stereotypical hacker. He's active, he loves mountain biking, and his life doesn't revolve around sitting in front of the terminal. Great. Having sifted through piles 'o resumes before, I can tell you he's already on the top half (yeah, it really is that simple to get in the top half of the pile, especially for new grads). Oh, it's not just the mountain biking, it's the fact that he appears to have substantial <i>actual</i> code experience (as opposed to ""I took a class on that"").<p>Uhoh, I think this about to turn into a short essay:<p>For the submitter: I grew up in Metro Vancouver, and before graduation I did make a concerted effort to find code jobs there - the pickings are truly slim. Have you applied to jobs out east? Toronto, Montreal, and Ottawa are all epicentres for tech jobs in Canada - far moreso than Vancouver. Also do not neglect the good old US of A, as a Canadian citizen getting a TN visa is almost trivial so long as you have a job offer. Oh, and for some odd reason Nova Scotia is also pretty rich in programming jobs...<p>I see you went to SFU and seem to have a co-op term of experience - this is good, but to be perfectly honest may not cut it against other candidates who have more fleshed out co-op experiences through university. Your cards have been dealt and you must play them, but remember this as a potential comparative weakness and try spin your open source contributions more strongly.<p>To address your concerns directly from my own pre-grad job hunting experience (as well as 6 co-op terms of sometimes insanely difficult job hunting): do not expect companies to call you back, or be overly timely on most contacts. In this market there are far more employees than positions, and while it would give everyone warm fuzzies to give personal callbacks for failed interviews, this realistically isn't going to happen. <i>Not</i> calling you, for better or worse, <i>is the de facto standard</i> for most jobs. Also, being disappointed at your lack of experience is not really lacking in courtesy - it's a fair observation that may actually be correct.<p>If you want a response, call them. No, I'm not being sarcastic, condescending, or facetious. I've opened more doors cold-calling people than any job website or spiffy resume has ever earned me. Differentiate, find out who will be reading your resume (cold calling works wonders here) and pen a cover letter with their name on it. Talk to your interviewer, ask questions, make an impression outside of the interview room. This goes back to the point about differentiation - it makes all the difference in the world (it is worth noting that this works both professionally and romantically ;)). <i>DO NOT</i> treat the job like ""yet another job"" - for the interviewer that leaves a very bad taste. Failing to be knowledgeable and curious about their work and their company is very bad for this reason - you are communicating that they have yet-another-generic-position-at-generic-company. Showing enthusiasm about what they do, and asking good question, especially pre-interview (e.g., during the job fare) is a <i>very, very</i> good way to make a good impression. It may shock you how few people do this.<p>Whatever you do, do not treat the job finding process as mechanical - that you toss your resume in one end, follow the handy on-screen instructions, and kablammo! Job! No, it doesn't work that way - every worthwhile job I've ever had has been hard fought and won. Following the ""rules"" (submit resume, wait for response, go to interview, wait for response) is honestly for suckers, and you'll be one too if you follow it without deviation.",1259824949

There are thousands of early stage start-ups.

What rational reason is there, then, to choose to be the first engineer in an already established company (given your equity will likely end up being worthless)? There could be exceptions: if the company broke into an entirely new market (product has to be ""good enough"" vs. high quality), or if the founders gave you <i>absolute</i> freedom to choose the technology (e.g. letting you use Haskell and Erlang if you so wish), but generally the scenario is ""I'm a business guy with a super-duper idea and I want an engineer to build it for me in two weeks, in PHP"".<p>To the ""business guys"": any technical guy who accepts this situation isn't a ""gold mine"".

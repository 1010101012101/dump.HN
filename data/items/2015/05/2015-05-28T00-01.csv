For example, they explicitly note limitations:<p>> <i>Because the QMT representation uses frequencies to encode the state, the number of qubits would be limited by bandwidth. Using an electronic voltage as a physical representation, we find that frequencies in the practical range of 0.1 Hz to 100 GHz would allow for about n=40 entangled qubits to be realized. [...] Since the quantum state is explicitly encoded in the signal spectrum, security applications such as quantum key distribution would not seem to be amenable to this approach, although they may be emulated.</i><p>And they even note that their approach has not been demonstrated to be superior:<p>> <i>It remains to be shown that this approach can be realized in a fault-tolerant manner, using existing quantum error correction techniques, and that it ultimately has utility and merit over current approaches to quantum computing—or standard digital computers, for that matter.</i><p>My takeaway is that the paper&#x27;s intended goal is to explain a neat, perhaps practical, way to emulate some qubits. It doesn&#x27;t do anything &quot;magical&quot;, it encodes all of the amplitudes into the signal (in a real quantum computer, you&#x27;d have no direct access to the amplitudes) and explains how to emulate operations being applied.<p>1: <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/1367-2630/17/5/053017/article#njp512897s9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iopscience.iop.org/1367-2630/17/5/053017/article#njp5...</a>",1432774086

9615412,comment,9609887,9615294,0,0,nickcano,,,"That&#x27;s a horrible example. SQL injection IS the fault of the programmer, not SQL itself. SQL injection is achieved by adding extra code to a query, which is only possible when a programmer allows inputs that can contain code to be concatenated directly into a query. Here&#x27;s an example:<p><pre><code>    query = &quot;SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE NAME = &#x27;&quot; + userinput + &quot;&#x27;&quot;;
    exec(query)
</code></pre>
This input can be given:<p><pre><code>    &#x27; OR 1=1--
</code></pre>
To make the application show the entire list of users. If this programmer used parameter binding, which is supported by PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and any other SQL platform you can think of, then SQL injection wouldn&#x27;t be an issue. They could simply do something like this:<p><pre><code>    query = &quot;SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE NAME = @:USER&quot;;
    statement = prepare(query, &quot;USER&quot;, userinput)
    exec(statement)

Security experts just charge you by the hour to teach you that you&#x27;re unfamiliar with the existing security mechanisms inside of these platforms.<p>Also, just to be pedantic, I&#x27;ll point out that a type system wouldn&#x27;t change how SQL injects currently work, lol, no clue how you think that&#x27;s the case, but I wouldn&#x27;t put it past you at this point.",1432773895

When we get too enamoured of the math, we go off the rails, because the universe isn&#x27;t very good at math and doesn&#x27;t obey most equations very well (thus the reason most wave equations require us to throw away half the mathematically allowed but physically forbidden solutions from of the off, for example.)<p>This is why the search for &quot;naturalness&quot; has been such a loser. Elegance and naturalness are attributes of our descriptions, not attributes of the universe we describe. Newton&#x27;s laws aren&#x27;t in any sense &quot;natural&quot;: they are counter-intuitive and weird. Einstein&#x27;s equations even moreso.<p>Mathematically-minded physicists convince themselves of the &quot;naturalness&quot; of these descriptions and go out seeking the same quality, but they fail to realize that it is something that is bolted on afterwards. Using it is a guide will very rarely work (the Dirac equation is arguably the one time it ever has, which is an equation that actually seems to describe the universe without any extra bits left over.)",1432773461

It <i>is</i> a copy, after all. In the same way that the music industry would argue you can&#x27;t upgrade all your vinyl records to mp3 without paying again. For example, should I be able to get Photoshop for all available platforms just because I happen to own one copy?<p>This, of course, brings us into the thorny world of whether copyright even makes sense in the software business.

Ford created jobs for autoworkers despite increasing productivity by 10X. Uber is creating jobs by lower the cost of a taxi ride.<p>Word perfect revolutionized document production at law firms. Before you had to actually take a red pen to a document and write in changes. If someone else gave you a document, you&#x27;d have a secretary go word by word and underline changes. Now that stuff can be done in 3 seconds with a plugin in word.<p>So what happened? People exchange drafts like 10X as often because it is easier. Sure some sectaries have been lost. But it&#x27;s increased the need for lawyers because more work is done that couldn&#x27;t before. And laypeople produce probably 50x more documents than before email and word processing.<p>Legal research: before you&#x27;d look it up in a book that contained key cases. You&#x27;d find something or not. Now with Lexis and Westlaw giving you way more cases to look at it, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if we end up researching more. People dig for a needle in a haystack.<p>And if you want to see how far we&#x27;ve got to go, legal research is still mostly done by having a human read the case and create keywords and classifications. It&#x27;s still more accurate that Google is for legal issues. But I bet that won&#x27;t last long. Frankly I&#x27;m shocked searching isn&#x27;t better.<p>But most professionals aren&#x27;t doing repetitive tasks a machine is better at. For lawyers, the only real easily picked fruit I see is document review. People are trying what we call &quot;predictive coding&quot; now.

And --this may surprise you coming from an atheist-- they should be taught in school as part of human history.  It is no different from teaching any other aspect of human history.  People need to know where we came from.  That said, the minute these primitive beliefs are placed on an even plane with science we&#x27;ve crossed from the reasonable study of human history into a delusional attempt to use the supernatural to distort realty for usually twisted control purposes.

That&#x27;s exactly the problem.  You are biased and, if a true believer, intransigent.  That&#x27;s is the HUGE difference between a scientific approach to reality and one founded in superstition.  Reproducible and verifiable proof is all that is needed to shift masses of people from an old understanding to a new discovery.  This can happen virtually overnight.  There&#x27;s almost nothing I can say to make you consider that the guys in the funny hats telling you that a snake spoke and bush sang are floating you a pile of shit that you are, for some reason, swallowing whole despite reality.<p>What would make me accept creationism?  Proof.  Proof that is supported through masses of evidence and cross-checked across a range of disciplines.  Proof that survives challenge and testing.  Proof that can be reproduced by anyone on this planet.  Proof that shows how the existing mountains of evidence to the contrary might be wrong.

Assuming that each of these devices remain widely used (as it is the case today) I think that people will make a choice to reach a balance.<p>> In that scenario, it is easy to see how an expensive watch that replicates smartphone&#x27;s functionalities would be a commercial failure.<p>I&#x27;ve thought about this problem for me personally and agree that I definitely don&#x27;t want all four. I&#x27;m fine with three of them, though. In my case, I&#x27;ve decided I&#x27;d actually much prefer a smartwatch over a tablet, in the sense that I think a tablet is actually more redundant on top of the phone than a smartwatch. I&#x27;ve actually completely lost interest in tablets over the last year or so.<p>I had a Moto 360 and there were moments when I felt a glimpse of the genius of a smartwatch. The rest of the time I was frustrated with the incredibly laggy interface, the pixelated screen, the flat tire at the bottom, the general massiveness of the watch, and the extreme unreliability of the fitness tracking options. From what I&#x27;ve seen of the Apple Watch, it&#x27;s a huge step forward in terms of basic quality, both hardware and software, but I&#x27;d have to switch to an iPhone to use one.<p>The Pebble Time has a quirky appearance, but it looks great in terms of usability and software quality, so I&#x27;m definitely excited to try one when I can get my hands on one.",1432771829

- The separation of writes (through log) from reads (through any of the consumers) is sometimes called: CQRS (command query responsibility separation)
- having a centralized log as the defining store for updates/ change events is sometimes called: eventsourcing
- as mentioned in article: elastic search as a consumer of the log, which only gets updates through the log, is an example of an Eager Read Derivation.<p>All defined on site of Fowler.<p>Glad to see this getting more attention.

Batch/periodic (e.g. Hadoop, DWH)<p>You actually need all of these at least somewhere in a company, and they each have their place.<p>The dividing line for request/response is that someone is waiting on the other end and that if the request fails you can just show them an error and continue on your way. So when a web service gets overwhelmed it usually just times out requests.<p>Consider an e-commerce site as an example:
1. Request/response
Displaying a product
Making a sale<p>2. Stream or batch
Restocking
Logistics and shipping
Price adjustments
Analytics
Product catalog import
Search index updates

If you have a domain name that was registered a long time ago and then realize that it's a name for some successful business and <i>then</i> start to use your domain name for something related, then you are guilty of trademark infringement. If on the other hand you've been running a business since before the other one started, then it's <i>they</i> who are guilty of infringement. If you own ibm.com for your business ""Indiana Boomerang Manufacturing, Inc."", IBM can't really push the trademark infringement allegation because the risk of confusion is small.

882648,comment,882480,882480,0,0,teilo,,,"Not surprisingly, AT&T redefines net neutrality to somehow mean that a service provider is required by law to provide specific services. There is a reason we don't call it ""service neutrality"". The network is the network. That's what's supposed to be neutral. A service is a service, which by definition is specific, meaning NOT neutral.<p>An IM provider, such as Yahoo, can offer any level of service they choose. They can choose to not allow you to message Skype accounts. Likewise, VOIP is a service. A VOIP service can offer any level of service they choose, and the network provider has no say whatsoever in the transaction. Don't like Google's service? Use another one that offers the services you want, all while keeping the same <i></i>neutral<i></i> network connection. Just what about this is so bloody hard to understand?",1255574914
882647,comment,882112,882292,0,0,reasonattlm,,,"The benefits of calorie restriction are only partially caused by carrying less fat (specifically visceral fat that triggers higher levels of chronic inflammation). Here is a demonstration of what happens when you remove visceral fat from mice, for example. You get life extension, but not as much as calorie restriction:<p><a href=""http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2008/03/lose-the-visceral-fat.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2008/03/lose-the-visceral...</a><p>Calorie restriction is doing other things to metabolism as well.

882645,comment,882619,882619,0,0,dasht,,,"""Cheap hotels"" depends a bit on your standards.  There are a number of motels - a little bit, mmm.... well, rudimentary especially along University Ave. that are the least expensive stays in town.  I've stayed in them, multiple times, and found them satisfactory for the budget.  If you want quality, there's several options easily found via web searching but that will cost you (last I checked) about 3x as much.<p>Restaurants:  Well, it's <i>tempting</i> to rant about <i>my</i> favorites but basically there is a huge spectrum here of price and quality and at any point in that spectrum it's hard to go wrong.  I suggest, if you have the time, walk around downtown, around Telegraph, perhaps further west.  It's basically hard to go too terribly wrong if you use some common sense.  If you like fine beer, I'd suggest Triple Rock.  If you like fine dining (and dropping some serious money), the cliche recommendation is Chez Panisse but there are tons of other options.<p>Transportation (what airport?) there are shuttles that are the best bang for buck.  Again: web search.  Cabs will soak you but are also more convenient and sometimes you have interesting conversations.<p>BART will help if you are coming from SFO.  If you are coming from OAK you need a bus or taxi to BART but BART can deposit you dead center downtown.  (""BART"" has nothing to do with the cartoons - it's ""Bay Area Rapid Transit"" and there's a very long (and ongoing) story behind it.)

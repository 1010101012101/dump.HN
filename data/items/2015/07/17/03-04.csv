But interestingly, my guess is that an Uber-style service probably works even better for the &quot;bad&quot; parts of town. First, it&#x27;s easy to identify the gap and start driving to fill it. All of the passenger vetting and geo-location reduces risk. Surge pricing helps smooth supply/demand curve. Feedback and monitoring ensure good behavior and that drivers don&#x27;t skip too many rides. Right?",1437105487

If they really cared, they wouldn&#x27;t ingest unknown chemicals. Actions speak louder than words.

Purifying street bought drugs and carefully measuring dosages is surprisingly easy and doesn&#x27;t require a lot of money (FWIW, I&#x27;m a chemist).<p>The absurdity of the situation, in my opinion, is that people are willing to blindingly trust some random (or even a well-known) pusher because the consequences of making due diligence are harsher, in their minds.

If a young person took this advice in 1993, he/she will most likely end up being lawyer because that was <i>the</i> hottest thing during that time while computers/Internet far from being mainstream. The thing is that predicting what would be hot 5 years down the line is almost impossible.

The internet has innumerable &quot;ugly&quot; sites (which are akin to subs for reddit). Do advertisers not buy web ads? No, they just buy ads on the sites they want to buy them on. Maybe Reddit was struggling to monetize at the rate they wanted. I&#x27;m sure investor pressure is high. But Reddit had a shot at being something like the internet on top of the internet, and choosing this path kills that. Doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s the wrong decision, but the response I&#x27;d have liked would have been something like &quot;we&#x27;re working hard to ensure these less savory parts of reddit are only encountered by those looking for them and are very much aware of the content.&quot;<p>NOTE: The illegal stuff obviously falls outside this, as the internet (and a corporation) clearly have to operate within the relevant laws.",1437105010

Will python analyse that I&#x27;m only ever reading from &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot; within the gen_uc / gen_lc loops, thus optimizing away the the other side in the upstream generator? So I&#x27;m basically trusting the runtime to optimize for me? Do we have benchmark showing the overhead for this runtime analysis? Does it work consistently with JITed pythons like pypy?<p>So far I&#x27;m just always too skeptical that I could program myself into a performance hole that require complete rewrites to get out of, so I stick with code where I know what will happen on the machine. Python for me is just the toy language to try these concepts before diving into actually performant ones, but not finding any significant Haskell/F#/.. benchmarks that can perform as well as good C or Fortran code, hasn&#x27;t helped in reducing my skepticism. IMO the thinking of &quot;correctness now, performance later&quot; is a fallacy in that the choices I&#x27;m making in the design phase can lead to complete rewrites in order to get something performant - in the worst case switching between languages.",1437104708

9901111,comment,9900291,9900633,0,0,prawn,,,"I&#x27;m sympathetic to the medallion cost/lock-in situation, but in my experience in the US, taxis have always provided a vastly inferior experience to something like Uber. You get attitude for anything bar a giant tip, you get trashy cars, etc. With every Uber I used, the drivers were friendly and enthusiastic, the cars were excellent and the app/setup is obviously a huge improvement over anything taxis do.<p>What gets me is that there is nothing stopping taxis improving their customer service, ditching their attitude, not filling their cars with advertising or pushing for big tips, or creating a decent app that everyone wants. That is all within their control. And they didn&#x27;t do it when there wasn&#x27;t competition and they&#x27;ve failed to do it since.",1437102359

Adding to this idea I would sign up for service that let me move around just so I would get exposed to different people and ideas. If you worked in a different location with different people each week you would build an amazing network pretty quickly.

They are still overly reliant on search and advertising revenues and their hold over the Android platform isn&#x27;t particularly strong (only via Google Play Services). They also haven&#x27;t demonstrated really any skill at product management with so many failed efforts and overlap between apps/services.<p>It&#x27;s also confusing where Google is going with some of their acquisitions e.g. Nest was expensive and arugably unnecessary and the self driving car is solid technology with very poor product positioning i.e. existing car manufacturers have their own technologies and don&#x27;t want to bet their business on Apple/Google.<p>It seems like Google desperately wants to be a consumer company like Apple when in fact they would be much better servicing business and diversifying their revenue stream. AWS and Azure Cortana for example both should have been available from Google years ago.",1437102073

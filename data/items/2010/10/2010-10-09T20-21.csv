The superficial quality of the science, its apparent professionalism, depends on the power and wealth that depend on the political idea.  That is sufficient to explain the prestige and apparent professionalism behind global warming.<p>On the other hand, every issue has its cranks and skeptics, and whenever somebody stands to lose a lot of money because of an increase in human understanding, they will fight against it, demonize it, and cast doubt on it as effectively as possible.  Cranks can tell a compelling story of the establishment's arrogant dismissal of them and refusal to engage intellectually, but their very unreasonableness creates the story.  Sane, successful people exploit their position to marginalize cranks because debating with cranks on an intellectual level is a waste of time and effort.  And the plum prize for a band of cranks is an aging genius of yesteryear, declining in his powers and feeling ignored and left behind by younger competitors.<p>On the other hand, ""everything-fun-is-bad-for-you"" hair shirt crowd has definitely moved on from Sex to Consumption, and they're joined with the ""we-privileged-deserve-nothing-we-have"" hair shirt crowd.  Attacking our primary energy source is a game-ending strike for people who are against consumption, so you can count on their instant unexamined enthusiasm for the idea.  (I'm one of these, though a lazy and indifferent one.)<p>On the other hand....<p>On the other hand, I'm never going to get anywhere reasoning like this.<p><i>simply invest in my own sustainability and remain healthily sceptical about any new GW science</i><p>A cop out, to be sure, but I can't come up with anything better.",1286657973

His massive body of work, which includes nearly 100 books, has for decades deflated and exposed the lies of the power elite and the myths they perpetrate.<p>Should I keep reading?<p>See, I've actually <i>read</i> some of Chomsky's political work where he's defending the Soviet Union, North Vietnam, and Khmer Rouge. ""There's no concentration camps in Cambodia, that's made up propaganda"" type stuff.<p>Despite the fact that we now know that 2 million people - one third of the Cambodian population - was brutally murdered by the Khmer Rouge, he's never retracted that or apologized. He did some interesting work in linguistics, but his political theories are whacked. Mind you, I'm not left or right, I try to be a pragmatist. But this guy is not a pragmatist, he's someone who doesn't understand the real world and has defended and apologized for and lionized almost all of the most murderous regimes since the Axis powers fell. And then he wags a finger at the United States, which for all its faults, is still one of the freest countries in the world.

Given how much we're spewing into the atmosphere, critics should be proving that something else is causing the recent heat records.<p>If it was really that simple, I doubt there'd be much argument: ""Measured increases in CO2 levels correspond to a change in atmospheric absorption from X% to Y%  in Z wavelengths, which works out to W petawatts. This is P% of our energy budget, and requires a temperature increase of T to dump that energy through other wavelengths."".<p>But of course we also have to deal with clouds and water vapor, and the models rely on accurately guessing some ginormous amplification of any CO2 effects in what appears to be basically a chaotic systems, so...<p>> Merely pointing out that models aren't perfect predictors, or that some esoteric and uncontrollable phenomenon is responsible for some of the warming does nothing useful to help us decide how to act.<p>It says that we can't <i>actually</i> expect that things will be as different as the models are saying.

>Global warming is not a theory, it is a fact,<p>It seems you feel you are entitled to your own facts.  The fact of the matter is, the planet is getting cooler, in recent history, due to the abatement of the solar peak, despite CO2 increasing.  These facts are easily verified and disprove your ""global warming is fact"" claim.<p>IF you go back far enough you can find that the earth has been warming since the last Ice age. If you go back further you can find that the earth has gone thru many of these cycles, including having CO2 rise as the temperature rises, even before there were human societies.<p>I believe you believe in this ""fact"" because it is a religion to you, and you believe in it like christians believe in jesus.  Thus, you are the target of your own criticism of rejecting things out of hand.<p>IF you were being the least bit honest, you would recognize that global warming is a theory.  And a very dubious one at that, with a long history of fabrication and dishonesty behind it, that originated in political, not scientific circles and which shows a clear political purpose.<p>The politicians have the motive- to gain extraordinary control over the economy. They have the opportunity- control over scientific funding and a clear mandate to defund projects that are not consistent with global warming theory.  And a history of falsifications and other frauds coming to light.<p>This makes you a religious zealot who thinks that simply calling something a ""fact"" is some sort of an argument.",1286657272

I mean, if one of these cars went haywire and mowed down a bunch of pedestrians before the ""driver"" was able to take control, I reckon Google would have some splainin to do.  With autonomous vehicles coming closer and closer to a reality, it's somewhat alarming that there appears to be no legal body attempting to define some guidelines on this subject.  At the rate our government works, we'll have fully functioning, marketable autonomous vehicles long before it's legal to use them.",1286655112

The very first thing I saw when I arrived at the page was a popup that asked me to sign in with Twitter or Facebook.  I didn't really read the title or the text; I immediately pressed back.  This is easily fixed by letting the user know what you are before signing in.<p>2) Switching between sites is really well done, I instantly understood how to do it.<p>3) I dislike the ""I like this too"" button.  It's not clear with what it does; I clicked on it hoping for a ""post to Facebook or Twitter"" option but it went straight to my Twitter.  I'd prefer having two separate buttons to know exactly what I'm doing.<p>Overall, neat idea -- but it feels like I'm being tricked into doing certain actions since I don't quite know what's going on at first.",1286655022

I am thinking along the lines of Knuth's literate programming.  What I'm proposing is a programming language combined with natural language, but instead of annotating a programming language with natural language annotations, I'm proposing doing it the other way around.  There would still be two separate languages involved.  You are talking about a single notation system with the qualities of both natural language and a programming language.  Yes, that is a crank idea, which your mind seems to be stuck on.",1286654991

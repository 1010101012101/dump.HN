Three companies I&#x27;m working with need a solution to this problem in the next 10 days.<p>I would literally have paid for three $24 subscriptions by now but sadly it failed to meet my expectations.<p>Some immediate problems:<p>1) I can&#x27;t add the metadata it requires to my Stripe transactions without writing code which I will then have to maintain. I&#x27;m using WuFoo&#x27;s Stripe integration to create the transactions.<p>2) I connected a Stripe account but I can&#x27;t work out how to import existing transactions at all. (Maybe above issue is blocking this.)<p>3) Why is connecting Stripe the 5th step in setup when it&#x27;s the core part of the value proposition and could be first?<p>4) I&#x27;m feeling annoyed and frustrated that time has been wasted building features I don&#x27;t care about (Expenses, Estimates, Contacts and Delivery Notes) when it doesn&#x27;t do the core thing I want to buy it for.<p>Here&#x27;s how I&#x27;d like it to work:<p>Step 1) I sign up and give my credit card details immediately. (I would have trusted you with a money back guarantee)<p>Step 2) I connect my Stripe account and you instantly show me a list of invoices I can download or email to customers.<p>Step 3) I change my company details until invoices are rendered correctly.<p>No step 4 or 5.<p>An extra bit of logic which would be fine for my immediate purposes:<p>- When I add my UK/EU VAT registration number include VAT, at the UK rate, on all invoices where Stripe reports that country of the customer to be an EU country.<p>e.g.<p>A $50 payment in Stripe from someone in the UK, France etc should result in an invoice for $41.67 + $8.33 VAT<p>A $50 payment in Stripe from someone in the US, Canada etc should result in an invoice for $50 + $0.00 VAT<p>(Once we hit significant revenue we might need something more complex but right now all I care about is making sure we&#x27;re properly accounting for VAT.)<p>Brilliant idea! I very much hope all this is helpful.",1400068791

7743190,comment,7742221,7742700,2,0,NateDad,,,"So, I think the key thing here is unboxed.  You <i>can</i> write methods on values whose in-memory representation is the same as an int.  It performs in all ways like an int (you can do arithmetic operations on it, etc).  It&#x27;s not boxed, the way other languages would require it to be in order to have methods.<p>C# extension methods are just syntactic sugar.<p><pre><code>  public static int WordCount(this String str)\n</code></pre>\nYes, this means that you can now do this:<p><pre><code>  string foo = &quot;howdy partner!&quot;\n  int count = foo.WordCount()\n</code></pre>\nIs that really any better than this?<p><pre><code>  string foo = &quot;howdy partner!&quot;\n  int words = WordCount(foo)\n</code></pre>\nThe only reason this is useful in C# is because it doesn&#x27;t support bare functions, all methods have to be on an object.  In Go, this is not a problem, you can have bare methods.<p>Also, extension methods, in practice (and I have a lot of practice with them), are a pain in the butt... because they&#x27;re magic additional methods on a class that only exist if you include the right project... which means if you try to copy some logic, some of the functionality will not compile in the new location until you figure out what projects to include in the new spot.  That&#x27;s still requiring work by the caller, except that it&#x27;s much less obvious what you need to do to get it to work.<p>In contrast, Go&#x27;s type definitions are 100% clear and obvious, and there&#x27;s never a question where the functionality is coming from.  That clarity makes a huge difference when you&#x27;re trying to understand the code.<p>Of course, you&#x27;d never actually do that for most C# extension methods in Go, it&#x27;s ridiculous to make a new type just to make it look like you&#x27;re calling methods on that type.  You&#x27;d just write a bare function like a normal person:<p><pre><code>  package count\n  func Words(s string) int {}\n\n  // elsewhere\n  foo := &quot;Howdy Partner!&quot;\n  words := count.Words(foo)</code></pre>",1400068144

If you are deficient in vitamin C because you are forced to eat foods without it for a long period, then you should take vitamin C pills to prevent scurvy. But if you are <i>not</i> deficient in vitamin C, and you do get it from your normal diet, then no one has established any benefit to its <i>supplementation</i>.<p>In that context, I think that the meta-study is relevant. People supplemented their normal diet with omega-3s, and it didn&#x27;t help. Yes, there are other circumstances we have to test.

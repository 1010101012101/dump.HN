4259634,comment,4258670,4258670,2,0,thedufer,,,"> Build tools for procedural content generation that work for game designers. What if game designers could procedurally generate a map that they mostly like, and then make tweaks to it as needed? The client would download both the inputs to the procedural map generator and the tweaks, instead of an entire raw map file.<p>This strikes me as nothing more than an awful form of compression.  Re-worded, they're saying write a lossy compression algorithm and compress the map with it, then diff the compressed version against the uncompressed. Then, send the client all of the compression algorithm, lossily compressed version, and diffs.  How does this beat using a known compression algorithm?",1342593084

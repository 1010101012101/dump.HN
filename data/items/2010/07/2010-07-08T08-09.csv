1496858,comment,1496791,1496791,0,0,antirez,,,"Another common flaw in broken benchmarks: use a single client instead of many simultaneous clients. In this configuration you are mostly measuring the RTT plus the client lib implementation latency.<p>Another one is testing on-disk DBs with datasets that fit in RAM: the whole DB data will be cached in OS buffers and you don't get the picture of how the DB will perform with big data.<p>Benchmarking is one of the most complex tasks, but for some reason benchmarking is usually not done by the most expert guys in the field.",1278579164

I'm working on a project that I'm calling ""Spaceduino"" to use an Arduino as the flight computer for a high-altitude balloon.<p>The idea is to have the Arduino interfaced to a Telit GPS and GSM unit plus a 433Mhz radio for telemetry downlink.

If I write one, that difference will go.  Therefore this is not an <i>intrinsic</i> difference.

They are big double-glazed windows, very nice, that are made of a single pane of glass with a horizontal axis so you can rotate it to open the window.<p>There is, of course, a latch, to make sure the window doesn't open past a dangerous point (we're on the 7th floor of a 20-floor building). The clever designer who designed these windows managed to hide the latch in such a way that it doesn't look like an ugly safety latch. Result? When cleaning the windows some time ago, one of the windows rotated all the way around and then latched itself. We couldn't figure out what was going on (the latch pin is entirely concealed) and so while trying to close it again, broke the pin, which required us to call in some window fixing people whose only option was to actually saw through the pin to close the window, because the pin was so inaccessible.<p>We also got them to install some simple latches. Those are clearly visible, and involve a little bar of metal with notches that you can hook onto the window to latch it. Clear, obvious, and I can guarantee you that no one will ever break one of <i>those</i> latches while trying to close the window.<p>Kudos to the designer who managed to screw up the usability of a <i>window</i>, though.",1278577418

(Long Post)</i><p>That is your major problem, right there - you are still typing a lot! When you're in a hole, <i>stop digging</i>. I had similar problems about your age, made some splints at home to correct some weird posture habits I had developed (eg crooking my pinkie fingers), and I took a break from typing for most of a month. Amazingly, the world continued to revolve without my help :-)<p>So here's what you do. First, set up an auto-responder on your email: 'Hi, this is me, but I've hurt my wrist and can't type for a few weeks. You can call me on 555-1212 if it's really important, but otherwise I may only be able to send you a one-line reply, if at all. Sorry!'<p>Next, like Zed says, stop lying on the sofa. this is bad for you in a bunch of ways. Sit up straight - it's uncomfortable at first but once you get used to it it's actually much more sustainable for hours at a time. You can't type, so don't torture yourself by surfing. As you're unemployed but still consider going back to school, how about a few textbooks (cheapie used on amazon, or from the library) to pass the time in a useful manner? You can make notes with a pencil and notebook - not much strain on your wrist when you're doing it at a leisurely pace, and writing is slow enough compared to typing that you'll be a bit more selective about what <i>needs</i> to be noted.<p>Of course, I am no doctor, and certainly not your doctor. But based on my own experience and that of many others I've spoken to, simple rest is one of the best therapies. You can still perform other tasks, the nature of carpal tunnel and the like stems from spending too long performing a limited set of movements with poor posture. Take it easy, chill out, and you'll find your brain still functions perfectly well without a keyboard.",1278576083

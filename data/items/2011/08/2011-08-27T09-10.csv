2931213,comment,2929693,2931085,0,0,gaius,,,"Teachers are in a bit of a weird position. On the one hand, they want to be considered as professionals, as a lawyer or a doctor might be, empowered and trusted to make decisions in the best interests of their ""clients"" (e.g. parents and children). But they organize themselves as labour, with rigid unions and collective bargaining. Do you know many teachers a year are dismissed for just not being very good at the job? None, yet as a society we have no problem dismissing doctors, airline pilots, whoever, if they can't do the job, despite passing the qualifications.<p>Given this, <i>all</i> policymakers can do is try to limit the damage that can be done by e.g. the worst 10% of teachers, by imposing strict syllabuses. The other 90% suffer for it - but hey, they are the ones who place protecting their union brothers ahead of the best interests of the students.",1314438859

Remember to check for injections and remember to hash the password.<p>Next you have to create login form and function to query the password with the username, then hash the password used in the login and check if the two hashes match. Then you create session cookie for the user.<p>This session cookie should have random hash which is regenerated always when the hash is checked (""Logged user updates the page""). Remember to check that the database does not have identical random hash when you generate new hash, if you take care of that then there wont be authentication collision happening, because this random hash will be used to ""login"" the user on every page after the user has logged in with his password.<p>Remember to store the random hash in the database and in the cookie and check that they match on every page load. If the cookie does not exist redirect the user back to login page.<p>Logout can just be handled by deleting the session cookie and the random hash from the database.<p>Wola! You have functional login script. Remember to check for injections everywhere!",1314438532

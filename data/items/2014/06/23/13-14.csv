This breaks with enough levels of indirection and gift cards add such additional level of indirection.<p>Also gift cards have secondary (and probably more important) use for thieves. Giftcard is legitimately looking magstripe card that in many cases gets processed in same way as card payment, so you can just write stolen magstripe data onto giftcard and get something that does not raise suspicion (store clerk is not going to verify that card number matches or event that payment method matches).",1403531986

I wouldn&#x27;t have recognized him if it weren&#x27;t for the shop owner. He had lost a significant amount of weight due to cancer and was out purchasing a new set of suits. He was in good spirits however, boasting that he had beaten cancer, and was on his way to pick up one of the last hand made Maybach cars.<p>I told him I had read his book and that I&#x27;m an aspiring entrepreneur, and so he proceeded to give me some advice, saying: &quot;the right time to start a new venture is now&quot;, &quot;go out and just do it&quot;. As we parted ways he tapped me on the shoulder and said, &quot;go and do it, when you leave this shop go and register your business right now and start it. Don&#x27;t delay. The right time is now.&quot;<p>Edit: I was just reminded that although he was filthy rich (as he described himself), he was also frugal in some ways and always after a deal. When we met, he mentioned that he had been wearing his suit for 20 years, but it no longer fit due to his illness, and so if I recall correctly, he bought at least 3 new suits from the tailor on that day. He would walk also around Central London, with his offices in Soho, and as of 2012 did not own a mobile phone.",1403531722

The &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; argument.<p>My counter argument is that bike lanes, while important, are not sufficient. Much more important, larger and prerequisite issues need to be attended to <i>before</i> bike lanes become part of the discussion. But I&#x27;m arguing against people who have a vested interest in biking, and really don&#x27;t give two rats asses that biking is a horrible inconvenience most everywhere and would rather shoot derision and scorn and the car driving masses. Weather, environment, convenience, terrain, distance, time, hygiene etc. be damned; clearly most people are simply too fat and stupid to enjoy the glories and <i>obvious</i> benefits of riding bikes everywhere. Everywhere is exactly like the Netherlands right?<p>I&#x27;m actually a strong supporter of bike lanes for lots of reasons beyond biking.

And more to the point, what are crooks going to do, switch to landlines?<p>b) The Federal LE agency involved in grabbing the records set aside for ACLU. The U.S. Marshals are, if I understand right, the law enforcement arm of the Federal courts themselves, so were they enforcing a Federal magistrate&#x27;s order when they seized the records?<p>c) The reasoning they use to say the search is reasonable; I know the law and technology have not mixed well with digital comms, but it would seem to me that if you have to MITM or otherwise actively communicate with and interfere in the operation of a person&#x27;s cell phone, that you&#x27;ve performed a search, even if you only end up grabbing metadata.

Moore&#x27;s law isn&#x27;t fixing that unless it somehow makes the web into a hugely better platform for apps.<p>As it stands, we are limited to only using these lame DOM-based APIs which have been strained far past their origin in hypertext, and only using Javascript, which has been strained far past its design as a way of merely scripting a browser. These contained some good ideas but they&#x27;re essentially dead. People want apps. So the original intent is warped to fit that demand, and the result is neither fish nor fowl. It&#x27;s mystery meat.<p>If the web weren&#x27;t so crappy, the monopolist would not really have an opportunity. Mobile platforms bring a lot of value because the web is a bad app platform; where you have the choice, keeping HTTP but using other client technologies is the best compromise available.  \nMobile platform creators had that choice and went with decent languages and more appropriate environments. Where a graphics API can be just a graphics API, and so on for everything else.<p>We can count on Firefox OS and anything like it to fail to thrive for as long as it is Mozilla against the world, defending the awkward status quo by throwing more lame hacks on the pile and awkwardly bolting on new device APIs to its browser.<p>Don&#x27;t tell me that if I can use a decent language and decent APIs rather than Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, that I am &quot;screwed by systems incompatibility and fragmentation.&quot; The web status quo sucks at a technical level and that is why it is threatened by monopolists. Doubling down on the technical suck isn&#x27;t going to help. If you want a benevolent monoculture to emerge, you aren&#x27;t going to get it by doubling down on the status quo and waiting until everyone gives up mobile platforms for ideological reasons, or because a cheap phone uses Javascript.",1403530949

7931779,comment,7930207,7930207,6,0,iconjack,,,"Back in 2008 I submitted a similar idea to Google for their 10^100 idea fest. It goes a step farther in that not only do you get directions from your phone, but the buses are re-routed dynamically, in real time, to optimize travel times. Think of your phone as a fancy elevator call button—you use it to summon a bus but furthermore the central routing computer knows where you are and where you want to go. The buses (er, bus drivers—for now) also get directions from the routing computer.<p>The 10^100 deal seemed to just quietly fizzle. I never heard back anything, and I&#x27;m not sure they ever picked any projects to run with. FWIW, here&#x27;s the submission.<p>10. What one sentence best describes your idea? (maximum 150 characters)<p>Bring the bus system into the new millennium.<p>11. Describe your idea in more depth. (maximum 300 words)<p>The goal is to revamp the municipal bus system by using a little technology. The key ideas are:<p>a. Riders use their cell phones as a kind of &quot;elevator call button.&quot; Using an Android app, they tell a central computer where they are (possibly automatic with GPS) and where they want to go.\nb. There are no fixed routes. A central computer is continuously processing requests and sending routing information to the bus fleet in real time. \nc. Riders are given instructions, via their phone, as to where to go to catch which bus, and where to get off.\nd. Integration with Google Maps is an obvious win!<p>12. What problem or issue does your idea address? (maximum 150 words)<p>Current bus systems are underutilized because of long wait times and because most riders don&#x27;t know the routes well enough to feel comfortable.<p>13. If your idea were to become a reality, who would benefit the most and how? (maximum 150 words)<p>The biggest beneficiary would be those who want to ride the but but don&#x27;t now because of route unfamiliarity and long wait times. All commuters would benefit from the decrease in traffic and pollution.<p>14. What are the initial steps required to get this idea off the ground? (maximum 150 words)<p>At first, a simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new model. Then, a pilot city to give it a real spin.<p>15. Describe the optimal outcome should your idea be selected and successfully implemented. How would you measure it? (maximum 150 words)<p>The desired outcome is an increase in ridership and fewer cars on the road. A straightforward metric is a simple rider count.<p>18. If you&#x27;d like to recommend a specific organization, or the ideal type of organization, to execute your plan, please do so here.

The federal government is actually circumventing the law and the justice system in order to illegally incarcerate citizens.  The American government is the enemy of the American people by the governments own admission.<p>It turns out it wasn&#x27;t Brave New World or 1984, rather it&#x27;s both, each enabling the other.<p>I just pray America elects someone who can turn this ship around, rather than doubling down on the stupidity of it all.",1403528834

If a fellow developer tells you something, <i>listen to him!</i>  If someone who doesn&#x27;t know what a CPU is tells you something, try to figure out what he really wants.  But even then, if he tells you something simply doesn&#x27;t work well for him, don&#x27;t dismiss it as him not understanding your vision.<p>The problem with some projects (e.g. GNOME) is that they consider all feedback to be equally invalid, and the self-appointed &quot;designers&quot; are always right.  This is the result of the Apple-inspired worship of almighty &quot;design,&quot; and is contrary to the very idea of <i>personal</i> computing empowering people.",1403528832

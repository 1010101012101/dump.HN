723494,comment,722562,723480,0,0,BrentRitterbeck,,,"What you are talking about is market efficiency at work.  You can't accept some things about the market and not accept others.  The market can be viewed as a machine that takes information and turns it into a stock price.  Previous information, such as an analyst's predictions, do influence the price of a stock.  If the company releases their earnings, a new piece of information, it is only natural that the price would adjust to reflect that.  What many people fail to understand, is that an earnings announcement carries with it much more information than just how the recent quarter was.<p>Now, with that said, I will say that I don't believe the markets are 100% efficient.  No matter how many papers Sharpe, Fama, French, and others publish, I will never change my mind.  Globally, the markets are extremely efficient, but there are local inefficiencies.  Identifying and exploiting the local inefficiencies are what makes one really good at making money off of the markets.",1248544633
723493,comment,723380,723430,0,0,JimmyL,,,"I don't read it that way. I think it's part of the character in the ads - for lack of a better word, he's <i>too cool</i> to always drink beer, and to always drink one particular brand. Doing so wouldn't be very...interesting of him.<p>Similar to what the article suggests:<p><i>But the most interesting man hasn't actually been conceived as a brand icon a la Mr. Clean or Ronald McDonald. He's more like a celebrity endorser. One who happens to be fictional. He doesn't shill with brio for the simple reason that it would undercut his claim to awesomeness. The most interesting man in the world, by definition, would not be found enthusiastically endorsing a mass-market consumer product.</i><p>I think it's also designed to be a link that the guys watching the ad can hook onto. Most guys (and this ad is squarely aimed at guys) won't only drink beer at a bar, and if they do, they won't generally only have one type. So if you follow the analysis that he's a celebrity endorsement, what he's saying is <i>Interesting people - like yourself - vary what they drink, so when it comes to beer, try this one.</i>",1248544484

723488,comment,722855,723354,0,0,alanthonyc,,,"I've heard the Watergate story used as an example before of a reason why news organizations should ""matter.""  At first thought, it sounds like there  <i></i>is<i></i> a third value proposition there (the three being fact distribution, analysis and investigation).<p>Upon thinking about it more, don't you think that the value of the Washington Post is a little over-emphasized in that story today?  As much as the newspaper itself played a huge part in allowing the story to break - from employing and training their staff, through providing an infrastructure for doing the investigation to publishing the actual piece - they almost had as much of a role in <i></i>killing<i></i> the story.  If the editor at the time had succumbed to the pressure from the politicians, he may have caused the story to disappear.<p>In the end, it wasn't the ""newspaper"" who investigated it, it was two guys named Woodward and Bernstein.<p>One thing I believe in is that the internet empowers <i></i>the individual<i></i> to do things that were previously impossible to do by one person.  Theoretically, I think this applies in this situation as well.<p>As for the SJ Mercury News example, would that not be the same thing here?  I'm sure there at least a couple of individuals in that group that are driving this kind of journalism.  Maybe the newspaper as an organization helps foster and nurture this type of behaviour, but so what?  Couldn't an organization that is not in the business of printing on paper do the same thing?  What is the difference between a newspaper and a blogging organization anyway?  Is it the salary?  Is it the medium?<p>Nobody is decrying journalism, just the old (economically) unsustainable models.",1248544129

723481,comment,722517,723028,0,0,philwelch,,,"Economics is great for telling us about these hidden costs, and I agree the minimum wage example is a good example where the costs outweigh the benefits. But it's not a clear-cut libertarian case of ""all things that cause economic inefficiencies are bad policies"". All economics can tell us is approximately <i>how much</i> inefficiency, for instance, would be caused by subsidized food stamps. It's up to everyone to learn what that cost-benefit is and decide whether we can afford to subsidize some folks' food purchases. (Food stamps, and voucher schemes in general, seem to work well in my opinion.)<p>Or conversely, if we come down and say we want to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions, we might say, ""Oh, let's inspect and license all the smokestacks in the US and write each of them permits every year."" Economists will shake their heads and say that's an inefficient allocation method, and then they will invent cap-and-trade, where we sell them permits and let them trade the same fixed number of permits, so that SO2 emissions stay under a determined scarcity, but that scarcity is market-allocated. We've been doing that with SO2 for years and it's one of the great recent triumphs of economics.",1248543878

It's become a world of side bets and arbitrage plays.  When an outsider analyst has more influence over the price of a stock than the company itself, then the market is a game, not an investment.<p>For example: a company can show growth, real POSITIVE growth...but ohmygodholyjebus if it's not EXACTLY what the analysts predicted then the stock is toast for the quarter.

They might be able to scale the number of neurons to the right amount in the near future (many estimate the number of neurons in the human brain between 10G and 100G). But the biggest problem is the number of neuronal connections.  Current estimates on the number of synapses in the human is around 10P (P for peta- i.e. 10^15). That doesn't sound as easy as ""just scaling it up"".<p>It seems most articles and discussions about the brain talk about the number of neurons and how to get enough processing power to simulate them, the way I see it, the bigger challenge is to be able to simulate the connections between the neurons.",1248543691

Monetarists think it's mostly a supply-and-demand thing with the money supply outpacing economic growth, for instance. But, of course, inflation is sometimes thought to be only one component of the cost of living.<p>In macro, there's two measures of inflation: the cost of living index (which is based on the cost of living and a market basket of equivalent goods) and a factor that is used to adjust nominal GDP measurements from year to year. Cost-of-living may change based on efficiencies (for instance, Wal-Mart has been credited with single-handedly holding down the cost of living for years) while the GDP factor is more closely tied to ""true"" inflation.<p>In other words, you may be right but cost of living is fucking complicated.",1248543369

The Linux kernel API is huge and local privilege escalation exploits are discovered on a regular basis (like every few weeks). Docker makes no real attempt to reduce that API -- it doesn&#x27;t want to, because removing any feature would break some app. Docker really shouldn&#x27;t be used as a sandbox; it should be used to run code that you trust but that you want to isolate for the purpose of easing deployment.<p>But, imagining for a moment if Docker were actually a sandbox...<p>> B can guess the contents of A’s secret files’ pages by writing its guesses to a file and then reading them and recording how quickly the kernel serves them back.<p>That kind of timing attack usually relies on systems where you can work on one byte at a time, cycling possibilities until you think you have it right, then go on to the next. In the hypothetical case you describe, though, you&#x27;d have to guess the entire 4k page at once. Even if the file just stores a single encryption key followed by zeros, you are still talking about an attack requiring 2^(key length in bits)*(time to force a cache flush and then wait for the other container to bring their file back into cache). You&#x27;d have an easier time bruteforcing the key from cyphertext.<p>The first part of your concern is true -- you&#x27;d probably be able to tell if anyone on the machine has (and is using) a particular file.

Most water companies aren&#x27;t big enough for a pipe factory to be economically viable, let alone building their own minerals division, oil rigs, oil refinery and chemical plants.<p>I suspect that security and running cafeterias do have economies of scale (e.g. a business might only need a drive-by check a few times a night, and so it is more efficient to have one guard drive around different businesses than for each business to hire their own guard), but Google&#x27;s demands for security and cafeteria services are probably high enough that they gain many of the same benefits of the economy of scale.<p>Allowing management to focus on core competencies is also important for smaller businesses, but eventually most decision-making is delegated to middle managers or even subsidiary companies, so the top tier of management doesn&#x27;t have to worry about it. For big companies like Google, it is likely that they have modelled it, and worked out it will cost them less to vertically integrate this function.<p>Businesses generally have far more efficient control over employees than contractors, so if they are unhappy with something, they can just change it rather than needing to renegotiate a contract.",1412490918

Although the distinction make no effect on your argument.<p>>Are you suggesting that morality has no purpose other than to provide a civilized society? That&#x27;s one view on morality, but it&#x27;s not that common nowadays.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s what I meant (roughly). And while your example (don&#x27;t harm other so you won&#x27;t be harmed) sounds selfish, how about &quot;help others in needs so you will be helped in time of need&quot; sounds? To quote Wikipedia: &quot;Morality can be a body of standards or principles derived from a code of conduct from a particular philosophy, religion, culture, etc., or it can derive from a standard that a person believes should be universal.&quot;. It does not necessary have to be because people are selfish, but because there are many many possible behaviors, and a universal standard (morals) allow us to know what to expect. The complexity of dealing with a large group of people (society) can get really messy real quick, just because of the sheer number of possible possibilities . That&#x27;s also why many people believes that when it comes to two adult with sounded mind dealing directly with each other, any thing goes.<p>I&#x27;m well aware of utilitarianism, and that&#x27;s actually (partly) where I got the idea of moral standard as a basis for a functional society, but I digress. It seems like the difference between your and my argument was how we tallied up the happiness sum. I draw the line at &quot;being human&quot;, and you have a bigger one that encompasses &quot;sentient being&quot;.<p>> Ok, then what happens if you decide a certain person or certain group no longer reasonably belongs in the category of &quot;one another&quot;? For example, how some Sunnis view Shiites, and how Hutus view Tutsis. That group is no longer seen as a vital part of civilization and can be treated in any way at all, because behavior cannot be intrinsically good or bad.<p>I was about to say that that there is no difference between, let&#x27;s say Sunnies and Shiites, except their belief, in the sense that except for historical accident, an eternal war between the two won&#x27;t end.

The rationale I am going by is that every class I introduce proliferates new symbols: the class definition, the instances, the methods, the values, the references to yet further symbols. Each time I introduce new symbols I bulk up the code and diffuse its meaning; the meaning of these symbols exists in the class, not at the call site. Thus, everything in a class definition is doing its job correctly as long as you want the class to be a true &quot;black box&quot; that hides behind the symbols it provides.<p>But in many situations, the algorithm is basically &quot;business logic&quot; and conveys the most meaning when inlined at the call site: &quot;Given this type of data, do this. Otherwise, do that.&quot; This type of algorithm assumes a schema onto the data, which is usually our true intention; having determined the schema, we can cease further indirection and begin our actual computation. And in this code, ADTs become less important, because we&#x27;ve already used those to query for the data; when we have the queries abstracted, we can stop. We don&#x27;t need to abstract the meaning any further. Relational database modelling is analogous; when the data is normalized, it&#x27;s very indirect, yet also very simple. And this pattern can be followed from within a program as well.<p>Consider the &quot;composable component-entity&quot; model that has become somewhat of a cargo cult fad. These systems generally understand the entity as a record of &quot;which components are used/where to find them/how they fit together&quot;. The implication is that a definite schema of &quot;types of components and their properties&quot; exists at or near the top level, and entities do not hide arbitrary blobs of data and functionality in deep recesses, as results when trying to build from class inheritance. Since the concept is poorly defined, actual implementations are all over the place, of course, but the general direction of it is towards flat/primitive/normalized.<p>The result I got from killing off some classes and inlining their functionality was that I found some lurking unused variables, clarified the top-level, improved the code&#x27;s flexibility, and reduced total lines of code. So at least in this instance I seem to be on the right track.",1412490025

The protocols are likely to get better but the number of infected people trying to leave is likely to be substantially higher in each month going forward for at least three to six months.

I would be interested in thoughts along two lines:<p>1. Maybe working Google will not be that great. They sure do have very smart ppl - but I guess you know by now that startups are a different beast. There was a reason you went into the startup world - maybe because you found more meaning in the complete responsibility a startup endows you, and probably that wont exist in Google - nor the adrenaline. Maybe you need to balance that 'meaning' in your job with having fun - your starup was all about meaning and probably too hard to be fun so a stint at Google looks exciting. Maybe you will crave meaning very soon, in which case Google might not be the best option.<p>2. ""And I have no cofounder, so I'd be doing everything myself until I could afford employees, and then I'd have to build a company culture. That will be no 'fun'"" 
Maybe you can still find a cofounder(maybe in Google). I am not sure, but I think there should be a way to do startups while keeping the fun intact. One thing that I have seen is that big companies afford you a default(big) social circle which a lot of times is the source of the fun you have. (Also startups typicall dont have cute HR's ;)). But maybe you can still create a big enough social group by just hanging out with other startup folks and have as much fun.<p>Just some random thoughts. Feel free to (not) reply.",1228827376

The model behind Long Term Capital Management, as well as a ton of quant firms that went under this past Q, was the take-a-bunch-of-trades-for-small-profit... and it works until you get a six sigma event (see 2008).",1228827049

391237,comment,390413,391050,0,0,steveplace,,,"I don't know if you've traded /es futures, but that's nearly impossible to do. There's a couple different markets that put in bid/ask, and normally you'll just see the closest spread, but there's usually underlying bids as well. That's why it's so liquid. I'm looking at premarket futures right now and the qty of contracts offered at the bid/ask ranges from 10-100. That means to take the bid out you'd have to have a margin of around 100k.<p><i>And since making money is presumably based on volume, if you did small trades, you'd end up doing a lot of them to make it worth your while.</i><p>Not true with futures. They are risky, but you can get some pretty nice returns, especially in the volatility that we're having right now. On a single contract you can expect to pull 1k-2k, and that's on one trade per day. In terms of R, you're looking at 10R-20R per trade if you're experienced enough (>2 years).",1228826845

It is that the Nash Equilibrium for mutual assured destruction involves the occasional nuclear explosion simply because players must be credibly irrational for the threat of deterrence to be effective. I can't figure out if this is interesting or crazy. But the fact we're not all dead suggests to me that rationality is overrated in politics as in economics.",1228826391

391231,comment,390139,391166,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"I wouldn't say Objective-C is supposed to be ""a better <i>C</i>"", just different, and better. They're quite different (besides the obvious fact that Objective-C is indeed a superset of C). C is a statically typed procedural language while Objective-C is a very dynamic object oriented language with optional static typing.<p>It's really quite elegant if you think about it. It's a highly dynamic language that was designed more than 20 years ago and is still very relevant today as the platform of choice for developing nearly all Mac OS X and iPhone apps. As far as dynamic languages go it's very fast since it's compiled. It integrates seamlessly with C (and even C++).<p>Just because <i>you</i> don't know or care about Objective-C doesn't mean there aren't plenty of people who do. I regularly see articles about Objective-C on the front page of Hacker News, Reddit, etc.",1228826198

391205,comment,390782,391156,0,0,olefoo,,,"The way I see it, identity verification is one of those dull, expensive, necessary things that will have to be done for the network economy to function. A private player will always have incentives to screw with it Imagine getting a message like ""You must be logged in to facebook if you want to buy groceries. Do you want to let the dietsnoop application see your purchases (Y/N/there is no cancel)?"" 
When you swipe your card at the grocery store?<p>And to go through your objections one by one.<p>a. Any identity validation system has to be a universally accepted standard with strong penalties for misbehaviour on the part of validators, relying parties, and authenticating individuals. If it's less than universal, it doesn't work nearly as well, a bunch of people can opt out, and the effectiveness drops drastically; and we're back where we are now with a bunch of different standards and competing providers each with their own agenda.<p>b. Microsoft Hailstorm? Yahoo IDs? Facebook's multiple data wankeries over the years? All the times that people have horked 100s of thousands out of other people's bank accounts by having the bank email a password reset to an email account?<p>If past is prologue, the cost to businesses of screwing up their identity verification is relatively low. Which is fine if all they control is some crap email and a few digital photos, but rapidly becomes unfine if it's your bank account, or your deed to your vehicle, or your house or your ticket to New Zealand; or (going 15 minutes into the future) your house keys, your medical records, your ownership of businesses, etc.<p>c. But as mentioned in my response to a. a body that can set standards and enforce them with real teeth is exactly what is needed. The other side of that is that any private party that had the wherewithal to pull off the introduction of a new economic system (weak identity authentication is the foundation that credit cards are built upon) is going to be or be rapidly on the way to being a heavily regulated entity.<p>I'm not saying I'm necessarily enthusiastic about the prospect of the government holding the root signing keys to everything; I just think it's inevitable. And the thing is we need to be talking about it now, so that over the next 6 months to two years as the economic crisis plays out and the necessity of doing something is brought to the fore; we can push the discussion towards sane alternatives.<p>We have a window to affect the policy discussion, but that window is closing rapidly, and there are lots of people who would like to close off certain avenues of discussion. You want peer to peer disconnected transactions? You have to convince people that those matter more than law enforcement, garnishments and debt collection. Anonymous transactions are going to be a tough sell; so are pseudonymous transactions. Hell, we're probably going to have to fight to keep J. Random Moral Prude from putting a kill switch in everybody's wallet that will limit purchases to socially acceptable ones (more of a worry in the UK and commonwealth nations).",1228824240

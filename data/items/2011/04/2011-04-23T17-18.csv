It's true this a policy violation, but I can tell you unequivocally that a huge percentage of used sellers on Amazon are actually arbitraging their competitors inventory. As a midlevel sized buyer and seller on Amazon, I've always assumed that these sellers had some kind of secret upper-tier arrangement with Amazon?  Because as buyers, we see high volume sellers do things on a daily basis that we would never do as sellers for mortal fear of our account getting banned. Yet somehow these megasellers seem able to muddle on year after year?<p>A lot of them are not necessarily even primarily e-commerce sellers, but are semi-camouflaged divisions of larger traditional publishing entities - like how the seller oneworldbooks is actually the textbook wholesaling giant MBS Books. These sellers are companies so large they are akin to major new-book publishers, so I assume their relationship with Amazon as a company is cozier than ours is as ""random small bookstore with Amazon account"".",1303581168

The broader question is, when does a foreign language stop sounding foreign?<p>I taught myself many languages and I can definitely recognize a point where I no longer feel like I'm just making sounds, but speaking actual words.It is true in the other direction as well when it comes to listening. It doesn't take years of study or anything remotely close to fluency to cross that bridge. For me, I think it takes two months of immersion for a foreign language to no longer sound foreign.I think unfamiliarity with a particular language's set of pitch, volume and cadence is what makes a language sounds foreign. Once you're familiar with them, it no longer sounds foreign.I may not know the words, but I'm more familiar and comfortable with the cadence, intonation, sound library, pitch, volume, etc of that language.<p>For example, every language has a particular native pitch. And if you're used to one language, this pitch change might strike you as jarring when hearing a foreign language. For example, my Japanese voice is deeper than my English voice and my Cambodian voice is higher than both of them. When speaking Swedish, my voice drops very deep compared to English.<p>Because of my meta-awareness of this phenomenon, I can actually ""switch"" my brain off of English and hear what English sounds like to foreigners.",1303580575

2477165,comment,2476440,2476778,10,0,kragen,,,"> Whether the naive implementation of map can be easily parallelized across multiple machines/threads/processes is not relevant. In fact, he even says that you need a 'super genius' to write the scaling map and reduce operations.<p>I think this brings out why I wasn't just ""nitpicking.""  Even though you're presumably pretty savvy, Joel's article has confused you. You're thinking that the easy parallelization is an attribute of the <i>implementation of map</i>, and that a sufficiently smart implementor could make it work.<p>In fact, the implementation of parallel map is pretty irrelevant here. The important thing is that the <i>function provided to map</i> create no inter-loop dependencies.  And given that, you don't need to be a super-genius to implement MapReduce.  The super-genius was in coming up with the interface constraints in the first place and recognizing that they were applicable to a large class of problems.<p>So there are two problems with these ""details that are not relevant to the article"".<p>One is that Joel is presenting these details in order to convince you of his point of view.  But since they <i>aren't actually true</i>, any confidence they inspire in you is misplaced. You'd be better off with a bald assertion of the importance of functional programming, backed up with ""trust me, I know better than you.""  Admittedly, that's not as much fun to read.<p>The second problem is that, although Joel has achieved his goal of convincing many people of his point of view, he has done damage to their models of the world in the process.  I fully expect to see newbies for years believing that you could never possibly implement MapReduce in C or C++, or that Java requires you to create a whole new file instead of an anonymous function, or that Google Search works by invoking a MapReduce job.  And these false beliefs will do real damage to their lives.",1303579380

So it won't happen til that concrete technology (eg. 100 cores) is widely available.

Imagine a painter and a programmer. A painter, starts with a blank canvas, slowly starts sketching, then fixing the sketches, then he colors the sketches (many methods, he's the one to decide), then fixing colors, then he is finished. He produces art. Well, the same applies with the programmer. He starts with a blank editor, slowly writes codes, fixes it, re-writes, fixes, maybe attaches UI, fixes UI -- and so on -- until he ships the final program. That's art, too.<p>It's our art, the generation of hackers, geeks, nerds. People who speak via electrodes and the Internet, open-minded people, people who contradict the system, ""RIAAs"", governments--the world itself.<p>For better or for worse, that's what I like to think of programming.

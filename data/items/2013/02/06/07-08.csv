LaserMotive still works in this space using directed laser light, funded (IIRC) by NASA.<p>From a practical perspective, wireless power transfer (of pretty much every form) can have major drawbacks... but they're ""rearranged"" in the system to make 'em palatable.  For example, the system as a whole may be incredibly lossy -- but that's predominantly at the ground station where you have ample access to power.  Often, you're willing to accept 10% conversion efficiency when 100% of the converted power is useful to the target (think of RFID tags).  In other cases, the benefits of near-field (short-range) inductive charging are (1) lack of wires and (2) more robust physical design (check out Sphero).  TL;DR: there are circumstances where all these things make sense, but it's very application and system specific.<p>As for your take on acronyms... UAV => Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.

Those ""other"" Christians believe in God, but don't accept the literal interpretation of the Old Testament.<p>To argue that all Christians are fundamentalists would be like arguing the all Muslims want to fly airplanes into buildings. As a viewpoint, it lacks evidence.<p>Even Einstein held something resembling a religious outlook -- but his supreme being couldn't be bothered to deal with us lowly insects:<p>I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.<p>Also, remember that, until the end of the 19th century, there was no plausible way for the sun to have been in existence for more than a few million years (in that pre-relativistic era, the sun's energy was thought to arise only from gravitational contraction), which wasn't enough time to support Darwin's timetable. So at that time, even scientists couldn't explain how complex species arose.<p>> We're just machines fueled by chemistry.<p>That's my outlook also, but I can see how religious people might possess different views on the literalness of scripture.",1360136940

I think the reason is just that the file-management I do these days is very different from what I needed to do under DOS; I don't have to copy files around to or from floppies to transfer them, nor do I have to shuffle files around from one partition to another to maintain enough disk space. I don't even have to navigate between all the different directories where my apps are installed, because in Linux they're all on my $PATH.<p>Using MC, I really miss bash's tab-completion (Esc-Tab completion isn't the same) although ^S incremental search helps. The NC copy/move/rename dialogs are really designed around the MS-DOS semantics of filename globbing (under DOS, you can say ""copy <i>.doc </i>.bak"" to make a backup of every document, but ""cp <i>.doc </i>.bak"" does something very different in Linux), so coping/moving/renaming files in Midnight Commander feels weird.<p>I dunno, I <i>want</i> to like Midnight Commander, but I just think it's a brilliantly-designed user-interface for solving problems that don't exist, or don't exist in the same form, as they did in MS-DOS.",1360136704

This is the identical market to the ultrabook/netbook segment. The ultrabooks would generally have better text input, while this surface pro tablet would have slightly better battery life and be lighter and easier to carry around (but not by much, really). Not too bad a product at all for this, and should get a number of sales from business users within a few years when it has been tried and tested by daring others in the respective companies.<p>However, from any other POV, this product seems to fall flat. Unless you have to, nobody is going to use a win32 app on a tablet if they can use a similar iPad app designed for touch. Nobody will give up the battery life of a real tablet for the difficult to use win32 stylus programs, and the win8 apps just aren't there yet. So this device will fail to compete in the tablet sector for the identical reasons the RT tablet did not compete. It's just not as good a tablet for tablet uses as an iPad.<p>Obviously it won't compete in the desktop/high end laptop segment, it's just not capable enough.<p>I don't see this device being any kind of success in the short term, but with revisions and company deals it may be able to corner the mobile business market in future - a very large market - if it survives that long with the politics at Microsoft and is able to reduce the price to compete with current budget business laptops.",1360135640

Extreme time constraints can often be a useful tool to break conventional thinking and prompt disruptive solutions.<p>Here's two suggestions that might produce a more focused outcome and reduce wasted effort:<p>1) Engage key stakeholders throughout the hackathon - so that a deeper understanding of their problems is reflected in the hacked solutions<p>2) Offer an ""overtime"" session for those who are interested in working with the stakeholder over an extended period (a few weeks or possibly months) to refine the solution",1360134361

5175259,comment,5174448,5174838,3,0,evo,,,"While it's commonly bandied about that it's easy to build a nuclear weapon, and I don't dispute that, I think those sorts of claims are contingent on having a pretty wide range in the amount of fissile material you have at your disposal. ""Straightforward"" bomb designs can be achieved by being willing to start with a lot more than needed U-235/Pu-239.<p>I would assume that the US has very few of the ancient ""enough fissile material to go critical trivially"" sorts of bombs. The miniaturization of atomic weapons to fit into, among other things, ICBM warhead nose cones, likely came about by using smaller quantities of fissile material with much higher precision explosives, timings, and pit shapes to push that smaller nuclear pit into supercriticality. Instead of a soccer-ball of dozens of explosive lenses like the Fat Man, you've got maybe two or three lenses tops. Less moving parts, smaller overall bomb, but much much more timing sensitive.<p>So if tampering or failing the PAL blows out an EEPROM with the detonation timings on it, you've got a chunk of fissile material that's likely not enough by itself to construct a working nuclear bomb without 30-40 years of superpower-levels-of-funded R&D into materials sciences, precision machining of nasty stuff like beryllium, slapper detonators, so on and so forth.<p>Most of the gigantic TOP500 supercomputer clusters we've built over the years at national laboratories are likely used towards simulating whether the pits, even in their current configurations, are decaying in a reliable way that the weapons still function if needed. Reprocessing a single given pit into a new weapon is quite possibly an even harder problem.<p>Now, if you can steal a whole cache of nuclear weapons, then it gets a lot more feasible, since you can probably make one ""easy"" bomb out of a few hard ones, and either way you have nasty dirty-bomb potential, but I think if you had the capacity to build a working nuclear weapon out of a modern warhead, you probably already have them to begin with.",1360134211

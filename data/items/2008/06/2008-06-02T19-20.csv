But for those that do learn it to a sufficient level of mastery, it's not only usable but at times wonderful.<p>I think there are actually two ""problems"" going on at the same time.  On one hand, open source software is ""too difficult"" for most people to use.  I agree.  But on the other hand, most people aren't putting that much effort into learning the software.<p>Is software supposed to be easy to use?  As much as possible, I would think.  But some ""hacker"" software that has a tremendous initial learning curve (TeX, Emacs, even Lisp, depending on your background) offers equally tremendous rewards over similar software that is easier to learn.<p>The reason, perhaps, is that in learning TeX, you are learning how to prepare documents at a more abstract level than Microsoft Word.  The resulting documents may be largely identical, but TeX offers the user more power and control in exchange for taking the time to learn how to operate it.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, especially if your job is to prepare documents.  It may be a totally awful thing if you only need to prepare an occasional document, as the benefits of TeX are not likely to be worth the effort required to learn it for you.",1212436780

Are they looking to make it easier for other SNs to adopt their technology?<p>3. Do you think people outside Facebook will actively contribute patches back to the project?

They've released Thrift as OSS already, so this is just another release in that vein?<p>I think the most likely scenario is two-fold.  One, they want to look like the good guys, especially in the eyes of the technical set.  Releasing a major component as OSS goes a long way towards doing that.<p>Two, they want other platforms using their technology rather than Google's.

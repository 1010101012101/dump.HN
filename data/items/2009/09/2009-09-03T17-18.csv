803043,comment,802381,802880,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Haskell is making explicit (and inferring - you don't need to type it!) what Python implicitly assumes will probably work, but <i>checking whether it's actually correct</i>.<p>The terminology is math-y to the point of exclusiveness because of Haskell's close association with academia* , but there's a point after which it's simpler to make the compiler check than to rewrite the same kinds of tests over and over and over. Type systems are for expressing your requirements in a way that the compiler can do the tests once, at compile time. Computers are good at automating tedious and repetitive work, y'know?<p>It's too bad most of the people discussing how these things work seem hell-bent on using Greek letters and other insular terminology for everything. Static typing is kind of a wash for smaller projects (I'd just use Lua or Python for something that will only be a few pages of code), but once you start worrying about maintenance or testing changing interfaces between modules, the immediate feedback from a <i>good</i> static type system really comes in handy.<p>OCaml is a pretty great language, but has some major usability warts and not that much written about it in English.

I never said that Serbians didn't commit attrocities. What I a blaming here is the Western propaganda machine (well ok, not Western, mostly NATO i.e. American) for lying.<p>Would you deny the facts that Serbian paramilitary forces intensified their attacks greatly after the bombing started?<p>I am not saying there we no masacres before, it is just that US knew it would get worse afterwards, they knew international observers would withdraw, but they decided to bomb anyway. Then they lied through their teeth when they used the victims of the retaliatory attacks of the Serbs to justify the bombings.<p>Yes, it was Serbian army who killed, but US (a suposedly rational country) knew that Slobodan would react in that way, and they didn't give a fuck. So it wasn't about humanitarian help, it was about saber rattling and not letting NATO get embarrassed in the middle of Europe.<p>It was not too long after USSR fell, European Union was gainging strength and US and NATO had to show the world who is boss. Yes, as a result they helped Albanians, and it is hard to play the ""what if"" game and guess what happened if they never went it.

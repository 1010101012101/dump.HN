If you live in, say Westmont or Downer&#x27;s Grove and want to get to O&#x27;Hare or Midway by public transport, you might as well give up before you start. It&#x27;s a minimum two hour train journey that involves going all the way to Union station and then to the airport.<p>It&#x27;s not just the airports. My wife works at ANL. There are exactly two buses a day which go from our place to the lab. And this is after a ten minute walk. If you miss those, you either have to drive or take a taxi. There are no other options whatsoever.<p>Maybe public transport works well in the city, but good luck surviving in the suburbs without a car.",1427608746

It reduced the amount of build failures by 99% and test failures by a similarly high amount.  On the server we would run those tests first and we would continuously sort the order of tests so tests that failed in the past would be run first to reduce the build+test time and find failures faster.<p>There are lots of tweaks that can be done, but these days having automatic build+test before a commit gets into the main branch feels like it is the norm.

9284029,comment,9282748,9283320,0,0,waps,,,"According to the ILO (UN labour organisation) [1], in PPP dollars global average wage is 1480$ per month. So for the US equality would mean that 50% of working age people earn less than that. This is only counting wage-earners. No freelancers, children, elderly or anything like that are collected.<p>In the US, average wage for employed individuals is about 42000 [2]. Since there are 300 million Americans and 6.7 billion non-Americans, America should shift almost entirely to the average to get income equality. This will mean the equivalent of a 55% across-the-board pay cut for every American, provided prices do not go down. Your rent will stay the same, but your income should go down 55%.<p>(This is in fact happening, but is manifesting as uneven inflation without corresponding wage rises, so you&#x27;d experience an 81% rise in average prices, rent, food, restaurants, ..., while seeing your wage stay the same)<p>Also note that average worldwide unemployment is at least a factor of 3 higher than in the US. So it would not just take a massive pay cut, but also firing close to 20% of all workers, to bring the US into the worldwide average.<p>This is why socialists are (or should be) against immigration, and should be pro-isolationist. I think that if you want to improve the conditions of the American working class, that would be the correct attitude to have.<p>In reality the period of 1950-today has been a very exceptional period in history where not only incomes were higher, by most measures, than ever before, but income inequality was far lower than the vast majority of economic history.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17512040"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17512040</a>

This lessens the chance it will mis-align when inserted into the plug.<p>- Use scissors or some other tool to clip the wire ends so they are of equal length and can extend inside the plug completely. after years of practice this has ended up being the length of my thumbnail, which is convenient since that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m holding the wire as I cut.<p>- Put wiring into plug and view that wires enter their correct slot.

If it&#x27;s the worst place you&#x27;ve been to, then I can only imagine you have not been to many places. Admittedly it lacks good mass transit, but that&#x27;s true of most of California (I personally would say all, because SF mass transit isn&#x27;t great either, it just happens to make the rest of California look barbaric - I say this as a proud Californian). And the car culture is especially strong in SoCal. Not to mention Irvine was originally intended to be a suburban community, not a metropolis. A measure was put forth to add light rail a few years ago, but the &quot;not in my backyard&quot; folks voted it down.<p>It has 8 lane surface streets precisely because of forethought (it&#x27;s a planned city, btw). Most of the north-south roads have 65 mph speed limits. You don&#x27;t get that without proper planning and zoning. It operates its own shuttle service independent of the county. Then there&#x27;s the high ratio of parks, green belts, wildlife reserves, and dedicated bike lanes relative to its neighbors. Demand to live there is outstripping supply, which leads to traffic, which admittedly sucks and hopefully Californians will realize you can&#x27;t keep throwing more lanes at the problem.

Moving from a relatively non-degradable substance such as gold or an easily-replaceable substance such as paper to a degrading unit of exchange completely conflicts with one of the major functions of money: a store of value. Fine, it can work for things such as cattle and if we accept your argument, humans. But one of the fundamental reasons paper currency exists is for small cash transactions. Are you going to exchange some of your equity for that weekly bag of groceries? How about that tank of gas? How much equity is that cup of coffee worth to you? I&#x27;d be interested to see how hypercapitalism could deal with these simple transactions.<p>As for inflation: is it as simple to control inflation as you suggest? Why is 0% the target? Inflation is a terrifically complicated subject.<p><i>While there is agreement that inflation is costly and should therefore be minimized, for a number of reasons policymakers nevertheless aim for an inflation rate above zero. First, available measures of inflation are imperfect and tend to overstate “true” inflation. Second, a little inflation may make it easier for firms to reduce real wages—without cutting nominal wages—when necessary to maintain employment in an economic downturn. Third, a negative inflation rate—deflation— could be even more costly than a similar rate of inflation, suggesting that a low rate of inflation might be desirable to insure against falling prices. Finally, at very low levels of inflation, nominal short-term interest rates may be very close to zero, limiting a central bank’s ability to ease policy in response to economic weakness. Because nominal rates cannot fall below zero, policymakers cannot cut short-term interest rates any further once they have lowered these rates to zero.</i><p>-George Kahn, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas<p>2.

In the following three months 3m people visited takeourjobs.com, but 40% of the responses were hate mail, says Maria Machuca, UFW&#x27;s spokesman. This included e-mails such as one reading: “We&#x27;re becoming more aggressive in our methods. Soon it may come to hands on, taping bitches to light posts.”<p>Only 8,600 people expressed an interest in working in the fields, says Ms Machuca. But they made demands that seem bizarre to farmworkers, such as high pay, health and pension benefits, relocation allowances and other things associated with normal American jobs. In late September only seven American applicants in the “Take our jobs” campaign were actually picking crops.<p>That was the point, says Arturo Rodriguez, the UFW&#x27;s president. America&#x27;s farm jobs, which are excluded from almost all federal and state labour regulations, are not normal jobs. Americans refuse to do them. The argument about stolen jobs is “just a façade” for a coarser scapegoating, says Mr Rodriguez, and “we demonstrate the hypocrisy.”<p><a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/17722932"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/node/17722932</a>",1427605709

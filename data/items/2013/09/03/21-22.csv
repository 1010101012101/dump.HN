I&#x27;ve been talking about this for years!</i><p>> <i>Grrr, I am upset that I am no longer unique for my suspicions.&quot;</i><p>The first part is entirely true, but the second part is a misplaced caricature. If one wasn&#x27;t operating with this threat model pre-Snowden, they mustn&#x27;t have been analyzing the situation too hard.<p>The people who saw the Snowden revelations as inevitable had to endure being buzzkills for the past several years while everyone else leaped at the chance to party with the &quot;cool kids&quot; as geeks entered the limelight. It was clear that Apple&#x27;s/Facebook&#x27;s/Twitter&#x27;s advances were primarily in the marketing department, but it was easy to ignore this to avoid being negative when you&#x27;re finally gaining long-craved social acceptance.<p>Now that the herdthink has shifted towards privacy, we&#x27;re seeing the same wishful marketing being applied to a lot of non-solutions to privacy (encrypting servers like Lavabit, remote code like Hushmail, facades of anonymity like Bitcoin, etc), when the reality is that <i>solving</i> (as opposed to merely obfuscating) these problems is extremely hard and any solution <i>requires</i> users to start taking a modicum of responsibility for their computing environment.

That part is fine - IMO the opportunity for sober, quiet debate about sexism in IT has sailed.<p>We work in an industry where blatant sexism can be seen around every corner, and yet every time it is (politely, respectfully, intelligently) brought up the overwhelming community response has been deplorable.<p>We work in an industry where a large portion of the population does not believe sexism is a real, substantial problem. I think getting angry is about all anyone&#x27;s got left.<p>That said, that&#x27;s not the &quot;off the rails&quot; part I was referring to. Discrimination is, despite the common lay narrative, not frequently about <i>hating</i> anyone, it&#x27;s about treating individuals by the (alleged) characteristics of some class they belong to. It&#x27;s about treating someone based on Asian stereotypes if they&#x27;re Asian, or female stereotypes if they&#x27;re women, etc etc.<p>It is an incredibly suffocating environment to be in, where every corner you turn you must first prove &quot;I am more than your mental construct of my class&quot; before you can be treated like an individual.<p>So it would be doubly hypocritical for those of us fighting these injustices to engage in the same. &quot;White male&quot; is stereotyped with &quot;bigot&quot;, but we need not engage in persisting these stereotypes, and we need not paint individuals with large brushes based on the alleged transgressions of their (involuntarily chosen!) groups. This is, after all, exactly what is frequently done to us. The off the rails part is the repeated use of &quot;White male&quot; as a synonym for bigotry and intolerance.",1378245299

And if your proxy server pattern is in any way predictable, and in particular if you ever visit a site where you need to sign in, then they have everything -- who you are, and where you went.<p>Also, a proxy server doesn&#x27;t undermine cookie tracking. The cookie scheme doesn&#x27;t care what your IP is, only that you have the right cookies, so this undermines the goal of anonymity.<p>Also, if for the sake of argument you encrypt everything, and if later on the police want to know what actually happened, they can try to force you to unencrypt your communications (or grant permission for experts to do so). In a recent landmark case, the police tried to make a child pornography suspect provide a password to unencrypt what might have been incriminating files of alleged child pornography. This effort ultimately failed (and the police decrypted the drives by brute force), but it indicates the direction things are going.<p><a href=""http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/08/feds-crack-encrypted-drives/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/08/feds-crack-encrypte...</a><p>> Lastly, if my ISP can actually see what I&#x27;m doing, is there a way to hide from them (e.g. does connecting through an HTTPS proxy hide what I do)?<p>There are intermediaries that scramble your transactions, encrypt them, so the content cannot be monitored. Others randomly route your traffic in such a way that it becomes very difficult to trace. Here&#x27;s one example:<p><a href=""https://www.torproject.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.torproject.org/</a><p>As to https, it&#x27;s a suitable level of encryption for everyday matters, but it&#x27;s not unbreakable, so if there&#x27;s anything that might come back to bite you, don&#x27;t rely on it.",1378245238

You might like to consider that stuff like the NSA is also part of the security theater; the ambiguity over just what it is listening to, combined with the perception that it has a universal reach, primarily benefits the US in that it keeps antagonists awake at night worrying about the security of their own networks.<p><i>I think people need to realize that the number of Bad People in the world is really small, and that they shouldn&#x27;t give up freedoms in hopes of somehow decreasing their exposure.</i><p>True, but it&#x27;s also unrealistic to be indifferent to an obvious danger.

Of course, <i>some</i> people get radicalized is response to western actions, but some people are bigoted assholes to start with. Recall that one of Bin Laden&#x27;s primary beefs was that the US had a military base on the sacred soil of Saudi Arabia (by Islamic standards), and this was just intolerable. Disapproving of US military installations on your non-US soil is entirely reasonable, blowing people up over it is not. Although the US had hand tangles with AQ before 9-11 (eg the USS <i>Cole</i> bombing, among others), the western response had been quite restrained, indeed proportionate. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the inherent fault of the west that AQ is built upon an a reactionary and quite absolutist religious viewpoint (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutbism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutbism</a>).<p>Now, I do think that when you consider Islam is ~1400 years old and look at where Christianity was at a similar stage in its history, it might well be that schisms, reformation, and sectarian violence are just stages that you would expect Islamic society to go through; but that doesn&#x27;t impose any obligation on us to accept the role of punching bag.<p>I don&#x27;t share your belief that scale is the problem, and if we just keep everything local and avoid the formation of large states or corporations we&#x27;d have peace.",1378245131

For anything outside the office/home having to rely on network access, if we are talking about business, simply isn&#x27;t smart.</i><p>I mean <i>precisely</i> that.  A server you own on your own private network, connected to remote views via IPSec/L2TP or similar.<p>Such a model would allow people who are not interested in running their own compute servers to lease capacity on a managed host.  But for users with privacy or control needs, we&#x27;d run our own servers on our always-on networks.<p>The model would require progress in network connectivity, bandwidth, and latency.  My frustration with modern technology is that many feel we have reached &quot;good enough&quot; plateaus with home networks (and other technologies) and these plateaus postpone the emergence of new ways of computing such as this model I&#x27;ve described.<p>I feel for 99% of my productivity and entertainment needs, <i>today&#x27;s</i> network connectivity would more or less suffice using an implementation not far from what we today call &quot;remote desktop&quot; paired with RemoteFX.  The chief barrier would be transfer limits imposed by wireless carriers.<p>If Microsoft were to seriously pursue such a computing model, an evolved version of RemoteFX could bring the remote/mobile experience more in line with local computing.<p>Reading your message, I think you and I actually agree on a great many things.  For example, I too strongly prefer (even) consumption on a high-powered desktop with large displays.<p>(Also, to be clear, I really enjoy my Surface Pro.  My earlier point was just confirming the OP&#x27;s remark that it&#x27;s not zen-like.

It has been a combination of racism, power-grabbing, and lobbying by big business <i>from the start</i>.  Look at the things that were said in newspapers and to Congress in the early days of drug prohibition, back when cocaine was an ingredient in Coca-Cola, if you do not believe me.<p>&quot;The thing that tears me up about it is that some of these drugs (primarily meth and to a lesser degree heroin) completely obliterate lives and leave a huge cost to the general welfare of society&quot;<p>The funny thing about methamphetamine is that it has medical uses -- it is used to treat narcolepsy, obesity, and ADHD.  Yes, the same drug that people smoke out of broken light bulks happens to be available by prescription and sold at your local pharmacy.  You know what the most important difference is?  Quality control.<p>See, pharmaceutical drugs have regulated purity, dosage, and ingredients.  You know that the methamphetamine your doctor prescribe will actually be methamphetamine and that it will not be contaminated with oxidizing agents.  Methamphetamine is not the safest drug to use to get high (the dose is higher than it would be for medical uses) but even at medicinal doses the black market version is not safe.  Likewise with heroin:  adulterants are a bigger problem than the drug itself, and pharmaceutical opiates are safer <i>because</i> their production is nice and clean.<p>&quot;Weed, MDMA, I can see being legalized, but the hardcore stuff I&#x27;d be more comfortable simply decriminalizing usage.&quot;<p>There is a bit of irony in saying that you think MDMA should be legalized but that methamphetamine should not be.  MDMA is not all that different from methamphetamine (in terms of chemistry, effects, and danger to users) and quite a few &quot;MDMA&quot; pills actually contain methamphetamine (as a mixture, or maybe just methamphetamine depending on how unscrupulous the producer is).  MDMA carries with it all the negative effects on amphetamine withdrawal (the &quot;crash&quot;).<p>Really what we need is to legalize and regulate all recreational drugs.  A world where methamphetamine is legal but regulated is better than a world where it is decriminalized and unregulated.  If someone checks into the hospital because of a bad reaction to drugs, they should be in a position to tell their doctor exactly what drugs they took -- and their doctor should be able to assume that those drugs were not laced with heavy metals.",1378243996

6323938,comment,6323472,6323472,47,0,dasil003,,,"The self-righteous anger about the irredeemable horror of the new Gmail compose is starting to get a bit old.<p>First of all, it&#x27;s not as one-sided as people are making it out.  I was also annoyed when it first came out, but there are some clear benefits.  Being able to browse email in the background while composing email is a huge win for my email workload (CTO for a 30-person company).<p>There are some important philosophical reasons behind some of these changes that I strongly agree with:<p>First, the small window by default encourages short emails which is always good.  The OA seems to glorify long-winded CEO screeds, but by definition the vast majority of emails are going to be short (and if they&#x27;re not I don&#x27;t want to work with you), so it&#x27;s correct to optimize for the short case.  The two levels of pop-out (the second of which the OA appears to be completely ignorant of) scale up and out quite nicely.<p>Second, the hidden headers and formatting options are encouraging simplicity in email.  Most email should <i>not</i> have formatting, and arguably most emails don&#x27;t have CCs, BCCs, or edited subjects either.  Putting them behind one extra click is really not the huge usability nightmare people make out.  It takes a little while to get used to and then you just subconsciously do the double click, it&#x27;s not really any harder than finding them in a sea of icons, it&#x27;s just that previously <i>you were used to that sea of options</i>.  The optimization for the common case is done correctly.<p>For me the new design (after turning on compact view) is a moderate improvement that did nothing to dilute the core value of Gmail which are the labels, keyboard shortcuts/navigation, conversation view and search/filters.  Running it inside Mailplane makes it even better.<p>There are definitely annoyances, but nothing that&#x27;s even close to driving me to something like mutt, and forget about GUI clients, all of them feel like molasses compared to Gmail.",1378243807

Each annoyance is small enough to tolerate individually, but in aggregate it seems to me that Google has really lost something in the attention-to-detail department; this kind of persistent annoyance was the same thing that led me <i>to</i> Google from other services years ago.<p>Two examples:<p>- maps: new interface is so terrible that I am actively looking for a replacement. It is painfully slow, search results are no longer displayed on the same page as the map (what?), and in general the minimalism has gone too far: the interface requires too much hunting.<p>- gmail: Previous/Next-message buttons flake out constantly (grayed out - clicking does nothing). New formatting options are hard to use and obnoxious.<p>And an old one that I ran in to again today:<p>- there is no (intuitive) way to copy a URL from google search results without all of the google redirect garbage. This fundamentally degrades the world-wide web. For example, I want to email a link to a pdf. If an in-browser pdf reader is not available, then the link downloads immediately and there is no way to get the de-obfuscated link. I clicked the &quot;share&quot; button in hopes that <i>this</i> might give me the link; but no, it wanted me to share on G+.",1378243496

Avoiding progressive enhancement, and then bolting on a hack for search spiders in a way that is less robust than the technique you&#x27;re avoiding.<p>&quot;The advantage of using Ember.js for Bustle is that it&#x27;s really, really, ridiculously fast. Seriously, try it. Go to bustle.com and click around.&quot;<p>The initial load is horribly slow. For example: <a href=""http://www.bustle.com/articles/4549-pew-poll-american-people-dont-support-syrian-strike"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bustle.com/articles/4549-pew-poll-american-people...</a> took 10 seconds. That&#x27;s very slow for a one page article.<p>That&#x27;s gonna hurt people following links to the page. That&#x27;s exactly the reason why Twitter walked away from it&#x27;s JavaScript driven content and went for progressive enhancement. A substantial portion of new visitors will have a cold cache, and have this annoying wait for what is effectively a one page article. (cf. <a href=""http://statichtml.com/2011/google-ajax-libraries-caching.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://statichtml.com/2011/google-ajax-libraries-caching.htm...</a> )<p>&quot;They could make it work without JavaScript, but they&#x27;re a new company with a long list of technical challenges to solve. They ran the numbers and the percentage of users with JS disabled is so microscopic it just doesn&#x27;t make sense to spend time on it.&quot;<p>Another contradiction. Progressive enhancement isn&#x27;t a technical challenge, it is so brain dead simple.<p>So they figured out the number of users with JavaScript disabled is too small to warrant supporting. Interesting, except, progressive enhancement isn&#x27;t solely about people with JavaScript disabled, right? cf: <a href=""http://isolani.co.uk/blog/javascript/DisablingJavaScriptAskingTheWrongQuestion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://isolani.co.uk/blog/javascript/DisablingJavaScriptAski...</a><p>Also, so they ran the numbers of these, under the incorrect assertion that progressive enhancement only impacts people with JavaScript disabled. But did they run those same numbers that determined the number of search spiders wasn&#x27;t microscopic, to justify the PhantomJS bodge you initially mentioned? Are you really implicitly asserting that there are far more search spider visitors to bustle.com than visitors with JavaScript disabled? (I&#x27;d love to understand the logic that lead to that determination).<p>So, what justification was there to spend time on building a PhantomJS site scraper to provide static content to search engine spiders, and yet fail to appreciate that progressive enhancement would have served that spider audience, as well as the JavaScript audience, as well as the variety of issues that progressive enhancement helps alleviate?<p>But, if bustle.com were a content site, then progressive enhancement is the way to go, right? But this is an ember app, so it is not a content site (clearly). Except when search spiders visit, then there&#x27;s a need for a static version of each page. It&#x27;s very confusion. is bustle.com an app or a website?<p>Also, how does bustle.com / ember, guarantee perfect delivery of assets other than HTML to a visitor&#x27;s browser? How does it guarantee robustness?<p>For example, when using a CDN, how does it manage when this happens: <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/01/05/google_opendns_clash/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/01/05/google_opendns_clash...</a><p>How does bustle.com / ember protect your JavaScript so that when a third-party chunk of JavaScript (like Google Analytics, Disqus, Facebook, ChartBeat, Quantcase, WebTrends) does something funky, or hiccups and causes a JavaScript error?",1378243007

I suspect Google has reengineered Android to allow for modular system-level updates, while leaving user-space modifications, (such as carrier and manufacturer-added software,) untouched, similar to how Canonical has stated Ubuntu Touch updates will work.<p>We&#x27;ve already seen Google take a more modular approach to adding Android enhancements via individual application updates to the Play Store, GMail, YouTube, etc. This has allowed users running older versions of Android to take advantage of more up-to-date software, despite the lack of manufacturer-provided updates. Given the degree to which the Play Store service can modify the OS in the current version of Android, it seems reasonable to suspect that these modular updates could be extended to include the kernel, system services, and low-level run times. Google may have decided that they will own and update key portions of the operating system, and leave their partners to focus on updates to their device-specific &quot;enhancements.&quot;<p>This prediction is consistent with the tag line associated with Android 4.4 on the linked page: &quot;It&#x27;s our goal with Android KitKat to make an amazing Android experience available for everybody.&quot;<p>How to explain the value behind such a &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; feature to the technologically illiterate masses?

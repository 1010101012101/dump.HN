(As luxurious and well designed as the MBP is, it can&#x27;t hold a candle to a Lisp Machine.)<p>Sitting down in front of one of those monsters with a big mug of coffee, an interesting task to work on, a rack of my favorite music on cassette tapes, many hours of free time to hack in the privacy of an air conditioned lab in front of me, and a bean bag chair for naps when I pass out from exhaustion behind me, will always be one of my cherished memories.<p>Ricardo Montalban couldn&#x27;t have expressed the luxurious feeling of power and control more eloquently: &quot;I have much more in this small Chrysler than great comfort at a most pleasant price. I have great confidence, for which there can be no price. In Cordova, I have what I need.&quot; \n<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsg97bxuJnc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsg97bxuJnc</a>",1402761548

That&#x27;s why I assign weight to his opinions and tweet sets.<p>Why should I assign weight to the opinions of the author of this rambling piece?<p>><i>&quot;Marc Andreesen tweets that tech superpowers “upgrade us as creators, builders, inventors, designers, artists: </i>producers<i>.” And it is certainly true that the smartphone — infinitely more accessible and far cheaper than the personal computers of yesterday — democratizes access to the information age. But what he fails to mention is that, when everyone has superpowers, that’s the same as nobody having superpowers, and the same social inequities that give some people advantages over others will reassert themselves.  The advantages of class, wealth and location don’t vanish.&quot;</i><p>This is a huge logical jump.  Everyone having superpowers is <i>not</i> the same as nobody having them.  Yes there are some positional goods but there are also many, many others that aren&#x27;t.  Consider the <i>typical</i> person&#x27;s existence now compared to 50 years ago when most the world lived in poverty.  Or compare it to 4000 years ago when lives were shorter, more violent and offered fewer options.

7892953,comment,7890104,7892365,2,0,msandford,,,"The contract says &quot;up to&quot; whatever because an ISP can&#x27;t make any claims about how fast your link to any and all websites will be, once the traffic leaves their network.<p>Let&#x27;s imagine for a moment a very simple case.  A network with nodes A, B, C, D and E<p>A <-> B <-> C <-> D <-> E<p>Now let&#x27;s suppose that (A,B) has a 1Gbps link.  And (B,C) has a 10 Gbps link.  And (C,D) has a 10Mbps link.  Finally (D, E) also has a 1Gbps link.  What is your ability at A to receive data from E?<p>It&#x27;s the minimum bandwidth of all the links that limits your rate.  So clearly we can see that the available bandwidth from (A,E) is 10Mbps because that&#x27;s the limiting factor.<p>Let&#x27;s suppose that my ISP consists of just the link (A,B) and they advertise speeds up to 1Gbps.  And then let&#x27;s assume that I can&#x27;t (at node A) download from node E as fast as I&#x27;d like.  The problem is that the ISP doesn&#x27;t have any meaningful control over the link (C,D) because their network only covers the link (A,B).  That&#x27;s the reason that ISPs advertise &quot;up to&quot; a particular speed, because they have no control over what happens once you leave their network.<p>Now let&#x27;s suppose that the ISP actually covers A, B and C.  In other words they have both a consumer facing link, (A,B) which is the cable modem to POP link.  And they have a back-haul link, which is (B,C) to their peering station, which is at node C.  Node D is on the backbone providers network and is the other end of the peering arrangement from the ISP to the backbone provider.  E is just about anyone else on the backbone network, perhaps Netflix.<p>In this case the ISP does have some sort of control over the bottleneck link.  They can&#x27;t unilaterally upgrade it like they could (A,B) or (B,C) but with the cooperation of D the 10Mbps link could get upgraded thus providing better (A,E) service to me.  Ostensibly when I purchase 25/5 service I am paying to get 25/5 all the way up until the ISP doesn&#x27;t have control over the network anymore.  But here the ISP has DELIBERATELY bottlenecked me ON THEIR OWN NETWORK by refusing to upgrade their half of the (C,D) link.<p>I am 100% sympathetic to the idea that ISPs don&#x27;t have any control once traffic leaves their network and thus the 25/5 isn&#x27;t a guarantee.  But the idea that they won&#x27;t make a good-faith effort to provide 25/5 transit across their own network to a backbone provider but still advertise &quot;up to&quot; 25/5 to me as a customer is completely reprehensible.<p>If you don&#x27;t have to make a good-faith effort to provide the 25/5 then why not advertise &quot;up to&quot; 1Gbps or 100Gbps?  Customers are never going to see those kinds of speeds but by the logic that &quot;up to&quot; language absolves them of any and all responsibility to actually provide it, why not advertise it?<p>The reason is that they would get sued for fraud.  They have no reasonable ability to claim the 1Gbps number over a link that can never ever get close to 1Gbps, either cable or DSL.  What&#x27;s the difference if they move the bottleneck a single link or two away but still inside the ISPs own network?  As far as I can tell it just makes it harder for customers to figure out and thus less likely that they will get caught.  The fact that it&#x27;s confusing and many people don&#x27;t know how networks work doesn&#x27;t make it not fraudulent.  It just means that it&#x27;s highly unlikely that enough people will figure it out and start a class-action suit.",1402760065

7892892,comment,7892471,7892471,12,0,kator,,,"LOL One day working on a very old machine many years ago in a galaxy far far away at the end of a 12 hour coding binge I accidentally typed:<p><pre><code>   rm -f *.c\n</code></pre>\ninstead of:<p><pre><code>   rm -f *.o\n</code></pre>\nI then typed:<p><pre><code>   make\n</code></pre>\nI saw tons of missing files and in literally maybe 200ms I hit the reset button on the machines&#x27; console!  I happened to be sitting there the only thing I could think is these blocks are still in the free list and maybe even the disk didn&#x27;t sync yet (did I mention this was Xenix, and 1985?).<p>I rebooted the machine from a 8&quot; floppy that had a copy of fsdb(ADM) and stated sniffing around.  Sadly the file changes had been sync&#x27;d but I found my code on the free list in the filesystem!  I then wrote a C program to dump the free blocks and proceeded to reassemble it into the original C file I needed to recoup my 12 hours of work.  Luckily most of the files where the same from a prior backup just one file had a ton of changes from that session.  It took me a couple hours to get perfect but it was better then re-writing everything I&#x27;d done in the past 12 hours.<p>Needless to say I then added a &quot;make clean&quot; target and I got much better at backing up my code every couple of hours instead of being a code zombie and waking up 12 hours later without backups!<p>With today&#x27;s modern filesystems I have no clue how you could pull off a hat trick like this but that was then and I used the tools I had at my disposal to recover from my own blurry eyed mistake.<p>A friend of mine once said to me:<p><pre><code>  It&#x27;s not how bad you mess up it&#x27;s how well you recover.\n  And you&#x27;re a professional at recovery.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m still not sure if that was a compliment or an insult...",1402758523

I do have one question: you say you went from someone who was quite ok to someone who was having a hard time and then you say you know things will get better with age; how do you make sense of this? I&#x27;m asking because some people do get more anxious with age so my understanding is things tend to get worse with age but, on a somewhat positive note, you will eventually learn how to deal with it with age as well. So, given you can only work on one of the sides, the end net result can be positive.<p>What does suck though is you migth spend a big part of your life fighting against yourself. That&#x27;s something I still have a hard time thinking about, it&#x27;s hard to accept it.",1402758164

I was thinking of the comparison between a top regional University, where there may be 1-3 (typically) students graduating each year who could become theoretical physicists, while at MIT there will be dozens.  Would you say Queens is a top regional University in Canada?

Its not just the VCs there but also the angels, where else can you find engineers who are worth 7 figures and can comfortably work for free or even invest themselves?<p>But this is an almost exclusively US club if you currently have a start up. It takes years to get a visa and go that route unless you already have, I believe over $1.5 million funding, which somewhat defeats the purpose of the move which would be to raise money primarily.<p>So if you have a start up in London and are not a US citizen and do not already have millions in funding you simply cannot move to Silicon Valley.<p>So if you are not a US citizen get a job there for the visa (not at all easy,  remember all of this years allotment of visas disappeared on the first day) and work on your start up on the side or get the funding and go.<p>",1192067296

For example, I'm in the market for a platform bed (because right now my mattress is on the floor), but I'm not going to check every day. This application would probably be similar to EBay's ""Want It Now"" application, but would be more geographically based. It's a great idea, and I think we put it on our YC application (as one of the ideas we thought about).",1192067197

66111,comment,65936,66050,0,0,nostrademons,,,"MIT, but it's not really a fair question because the Boston startup scene isn't shaped like a bullseye.  It's really two lines, following major traffic arteries.  The city corridor is along the Red Line, from Davis to South Station.  The suburb corridor is Route 128, from Rt. 3 in Burlington to Needham.  <p>Both of them don't really drop off with distance - Davis (near the end of the red line) is as much of a startup center than Central, and Burlington (the northern end of the 128 corridor) is more of one than Weston (though this isn't really fair: Weston is a bedroom community for all the venture capitalists that fund them).  They do, however, drop off dramatically if you move laterally: Billerica and Carlisle are rural bedroom communities, dramatically different from the high-tech industries in neighboring Bedford and Burlington.",1192066822

Which is more or less what I'm proposing.<p>Also, I see your point about the knowledge seeking demographic. Not sure whether I agree or not. For every Jimbo Wales looking to hire a philosophy postdoc, there could be a hundred MySpacers looking to hire someone to clean out their bongs. Or maybe not, who knows.<p>Also, on a different topic, there should be a way to embed ads for experts onto my blog or homepage.",1192066409

66105,comment,65969,66087,0,0,Alex3917,,,"If the user knows what a site does and what they're trying to do, then it makes sense to have a really clean design that gets them where they're going in the fewest clicks. But back in 1997 most of eBay's prospective users didn't know what eBay was, what they were doing there, or what eBay could do for them. <p>Hypothesis: The less the users know what the site does and what they want to do, in other words the less clear the goal, the less important it is to minimize the number of clicks to reach that goal. And the more experience users have with a site, the more important it is to streamline the process.<p>I think premature optimization applies to not just code but also design. For example, joining the Wikipedia community is probably much more difficult now even though the meta pages are much more ordered and clean than a few years ago. Whereas when the community pages were a hodgepodge of random crap it was a lot easier to just jump into the community and start contributing. ",1192065723

66102,comment,65969,66100,0,0,rwebb,,,"Ah yes, that does clarify things.  We've helped our buyers write their first listings, so that's probably why they look similar.  The steps that buyers go through prompt them for specific data points that help them create complete listings, but the description you are referring to is just a text field.  It's interesting that you were scanning those - I just did as well and the similarity of the text jumped out at me too.  Thanks for the feedback!",1192064588
66101,comment,65969,66036,0,0,jkush,,,"No, but you also need to have a very clear design which transmits a mental model of how your site operates. I'd be skeptical of a site that was messy and over cluttered <i>especially</i> if I was going to be using it to trade knowledge!<p>I think a clinical, empty look wouldn't do, but adding more mess is the wrong direction.

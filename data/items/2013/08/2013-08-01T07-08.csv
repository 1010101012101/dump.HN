In addition to the problems you highlighted, were are currently approaching the maximum yield capacity for many crops, and are pushing the maximum land under cultivation for some.<p>There are huge problems to solve in all those areas. The biological problems are made more important by the lack of progress in solving the world equality problems. By 2050, when the world population is something in the region of 9-12 billion, either billions will be starving or we will have solved one or more of those problems. The science problems are tractable, while the others are ill defined and involve many factors we cannot control, so I think there&#x27;s a stronger moral imperative to work on the science.<p>The other consideration is that working in a job that, by chance, invokes positive social results is not equivalent to working directly on trying to solve a problem. Progress in science suffers because there aren&#x27;t enough good people working on these problems, because so many of them are seduced by industry.<p>I don&#x27;t work for Monsanto; that&#x27;s a straw man.

When N is {1, 2, 4} a fast inverse DCT algorithm can be used with great success.<p>In fact, N == 1 is a trivial inversion and it might be tempting to use it as the low-resolution image instead of a thumbnail, but you still have to unpack all of the DCT coefficients to get to it, which can be expensive (Huffman).",1375342167

You can lossily compress the audio that produces binarual beats and it&#x27;s just fine.  All it really is is two pitches being played, one of the left channel and one on the right.  The two channels play tones that are almost the same pitch (but not quite, usually separated by 4-20 Hz).  There&#x27;s no inaudible part of the waves.  Two sine waves work great, with no harmonics, and nothing inaudible about them.  Unless your mp3 encoder is changing the pitch of the sine waves (which it isn&#x27;t), it will work perfectly.<p>You can find all sorts of (compressed) Youtube videos with binaural beats that are reproduced correctly.",1375341432

You must set out an assortment of foods and hope that the majority of the plate appeals to a palette that isn&#x27;t your own. Children are finicky eaters. They lack the vocabulary and experience to tell you when a flavor isn&#x27;t working for them. You have to puzzle out the situation, which oft times looks suspiciously like boredom or defiance, and seamlessly redirect to another dish. In many ways, adults are easier students. Cooking for someone excited about eating is a joy.<p>Start teaching by teaching. Approach your local [Parks and Rec Department, Adult Ed program, homeschool group, SBA/SCORE office, science museum] about offering a short intro class. Be modest in your proposal but be prepared to exceed the lessons outlined. You just don&#x27;t know your student base yet. Different programs will bring in different kinds of people. Experience will allow you to dial in your favorite student type as well as your methods and materials before going independent. You may even keep these gigs as a steady source of new private students and cash. Try it out.<p>(As an aside: Six year olds are still learning basic grammar structures and logic. Many still need physical objects to perform basic math equations. Even those who appear to grasp abstract concepts are often &quot;looking&quot; at objects or example situations in their mind&#x27;s eye. Programming is a stretch at this age. Isla succeeds because offers immediate and &quot;tangible&quot; feedback and works using a basic adjective-noun structure young children understand. Scratch is a steep step up from Isla. Probably age eight would be the soonest a typical child would enjoy playing with the language without an adult sitting next to them helping.)",1375340846

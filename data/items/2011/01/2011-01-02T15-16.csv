2060178,comment,2059964,2060114,0,0,FooBarWidget,,,"> It's not the sort of thing that's easy to prove empirically one way or the other<p>On the contrary. People on real production environments encounter the lack of compatibility guarantee all the time. Bundler is a way to guarantee compatibility regardless of actual future release compatibility.<p>> other languages take that guarantee more seriously<p>In general this seems to be true, but they do so on a best-effort basis. None of them provide perfect guarantee; that is, if there's some kind of law that would allow you to sue them $1000000 every time they break compatibility you would be VERY rich by now.<p>For example many people who use Python in production environments use virtualenv to guarantee compatibility. Virtualenv has a similar function to Bundler. Java people just tend to vendor specific versions of dependencies and don't rely on shared dependencies at all.<p>Even high-profile libraries that have extremely well-defined compatibility guarantees - such as GTK - tend to mess up from time to time. A few years ago they made a change in GObject. If you upgraded GTK then that would break the GNOME login manager, rendering your desktop useless (this problem was later fixed).<p>Breaking compatibility because of human error happens all the time, and often in unexpected ways. Bundler and similar tools provide protection against that in return for a bunch of other disadvantages. The point is you can't see compatibility as an either-perfect-or-nonexistant thing.",1293982923

There was a time, in living memory, when this argument was strong. But it became moot several years ago when they started giving away free encyclopedias in my breakfast cereal.<p>B) Duplicate code sucks up memory in running processes. This argument is still potentially strong, but without getting into the important Ruby-centric details (Can separate processes usefully share Ruby code anyway? What are the mechanisms for that? Do people really often run more than, say, two Ruby interpreter codebases on any given machine?) let's just point out that this is premature optimization -- especially in 2011, when RAM is cheap, boxes are cheap, everything is virtualized, and you should probably be running every application in its own virtual server anyway.<p>In the general case, it is more important that code be simple to install, correct, and reliable than that it have a light memory footprint. If you are smart enough and motivated enough to understand the need to optimize your software you have the tools to do so.<p>C) Duplicate code creates management headaches. You think you've updated the gem, but you've really only done so in one place. You forgot the other six places.<p>This is a real concern, but RVM plus Bundler represents an improvement, not a regression. For one thing: Before RVM there were several incidents where I battled the infamous `gem install` vs `sudo gem install` dichotomy.

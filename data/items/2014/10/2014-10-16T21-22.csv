8468051,comment,8466023,8467960,0,0,brandonb,,,"Sounds good. What I&#x27;ve mostly seen is that LDL, total cholesterol, and triglycerides seem to be highly correlated, and adding in any one of those three (assuming you also have HDL) gives the same accuracy, so the risk modelers usually just stick with total cholesterol since more patients know it.<p>For ratios, this particular model is log-linear:
  risk = b^(w0 + w1<i>log(cholesterol) + w2</i>log(hdl) + ...)<p>So adding in variables to represent ratios would change the coefficients, but not the final risks.<p>For that last one, the &quot;low cholesterol&quot; bucket they allude to is people whose total cholesterol is <180 mg/dL. 180 mg/dL is exceptionally low, particularly for an older population. There&#x27;s also a potential confounding effect when you study only total cholesterol (ignoring HDL)--your &quot;low cholesterol&quot; group of people includes a disproportionate number whose HDL (&quot;good&quot;) cholesterol is also low, and who thus are actually at a high risk of heart disease according to models like the Framingham one.",1413496660

8468040,comment,8465640,8466383,0,0,zackmorris,,,"I was surprised to get down voted for my comment, but, that&#x27;s a perfect example of the chilling effect that the DMCA has had upon discussing freedom in the information age.<p>What the DMCA (and similar IP law) gets wrong is persecuting sharers with &quot;intent to distribute&quot;.  Copyright law was originally intended to protect creators from other people profiting off of their work by copying it.  I&#x27;m all for the government cracking down on bootleggers.<p>But I’m very much against the notion that we should go after people who use or view content that is already publicly available.  To use your example, the MPAA could and should go after someone who leaks a movie online.  But, they should have to prove that the person profited in some way from his or her actions (and correspondingly, the penalty for doing so should be somehow proportionate to that profit).  Individual users who share the movie on BitTorrent are not breaking copyright law, because they are not selling copies.  It’s really that simple.  I personally don’t think that it’s the government’s responsibility to devote resources to tracking down sharers, and certainly not to prosecute them.  If we want to consider laws regarding “stealing” intellectual property, we can certainly do that as a society, but that has nothing to do with copyright (trademarks or patents either).<p>And to be clear, the only thing that new IP laws could address is the potential lost income of content producers.  But, there is no way to prove that a sharer would have paid to view that work in the first place.  I personally think that this flies in the face of free market economics.  The government’s role is to create and manage a fair playing field for all players.  So if it is going to start prosecuting thought crime, then it needs to remember its duty and crack down on monopolies and the bribery (ahem, lobbying) that props up media corporations with lifetime-length copyrights and the loss of the public domain through the use of paywalls (among other things).  So the DMCA put the cart before the horse by not reinstating the Sherman Antitrust Act, not setting realistic limits on copyright and other IP laws, etc.  The DMCA has done nothing to increase the income of new artists, and everything to further enrich established media corporations like Disney (I would argue by design).<p>We need to also consider that courtrooms and juries are the most important link in the legal chain.  By not hearing every case in a court of law, we are passing the burden to individuals to prove their innocence against large institutions (by settling out of court, since they simply can’t afford to lose).  I think this flies in the face of the notion of innocent until proven guilty.  Whenever I see another child or elderly person being prosecuted for file sharing, it strikes me as being closer to extortion than justice.<p>So to summarize, I don’t recognize “§ 512 of the DMCA” as necessary or even valid, because ISPs and hosting providers that don’t sell the copies they store are not breaking copyright law in the first place.  A website that charges money to view HBO Go’s stream is breaking the law.  A website that provides a storage space for a file is not.  So the DMCA was not necessary in the first place, and we should be enforcing the laws that are already on the books before creating new ones.<p>My hope for the future is that we reduce copyright and patent periods to something reasonable like 5 or 10 years, only cover works by copyright (so physical records, books, paintings, movie reels, etc, not bits), invalidate all process patents (so no software, business or medical patents), make it illegal to create laws regarding DRM schemes (in other words, leave it up to the private sector to fight the arms race against cracking), and force worries about whether a work is fair use to be heard in court (judged by people, not metrics).  Then I hope that we bring back the Fairness Doctrine to promote broadcasts that are in the public good (real news, not infotainment), more funding for public television and teaching art in school, and bar prosecution for using works for educational and nonprofit purposes.<p>I think this is a case of, what you are saying about protections for businesses (both producers and carriers) has some validity, but for me, democracy, personal freedom and liberty come first.  I don’t want to live in a country where we can be shaken down by corporations because they are worried about their bottom lines.",1413496542

At the end of Uni most people are lucky to get an internship. Students leaving our program are looking for exactly that, at best a junior position or their first couple small freelance contracts.<p>Its not that I disagree with the claim that many, most, maybe almost all bootcamps fail to educate their students on the status they leave the course in (before they do the course) and on how to effectively approach the industry, but that&#x27;s business side unfortunately.<p>I also don&#x27;t see it hurting the industry at all, but that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re saying. What you claim is that it hurts the individuals who are misguided, therefore the guinea pigs. Totally fair. We work pretty closely with each student and though we might sell big at signup, the conversations before enrollment are all based around realistic expectations and getting them psyched to start the long haul towards a new career. Of course I could just be saying that, but its one way we try to define ourselves and the quality of our students.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I understand the Facebook comment. Do you work there?

Lots of governments and school systems working towards this. We actually launched something today which is part of our first attempt at helping this effort along, providing training specifically designed for teaching teachers how to teach code, as that&#x27;s currently the ed system&#x27;s biggest barrier. Would love your thoughts on the concept, not as a business but as a way of advancing technology, filling the &quot;skills&quot; gap by creating early awareness, and then putting bootcamps in a position to advance people with perspective should it come to that...

GCC has many tools for detecting problems in your code, and there are some options which enable several such diagnostics at the same time.  Note that ubsan doesn&#x27;t include asan, which (in my mind) is way more useful than ubsan.<p>However, an implicit conversion from void * is very common in C.  As an observation, most C programmers do not cast the result of malloc().  If you use an explicit cast on your malloc() on Stack Overflow, C programmers will come out of the woodwork to explain not only why it&#x27;s unnecessary, but why the cast can hide undefined behavior[1], and so you shouldn&#x27;t do it!  So this is a no-go.  Maybe you can ask for it as an optional warning if you really want it.<p>The other one you asked for is already available: -Wwrite-strings.  If you want an error, -Werror=write-strings.<p>I suggest browsing the docs, if you are interested in getting more warnings:<p><a href=""https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.9.1/gcc/Warning-Options.html#Warning-Options"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.9.1/gcc/Warning-Options...</a><p>[1] If you forget to include <stdlib.h>, then you will get an implicit declaration for malloc() which returns int.  An explicit cast from int to e.g. char* is NOT what you want.  You can, of course, turn on -Werror=implicit-function-declaration.  However, if you just omit the cast, you will always get an error because the int can&#x27;t be implicitly converted to a pointer type.",1413496232

The idea was that authors were skilled workers practicing a valuable craft, and that the mere fact that distributors <i>could</i> ignore them in practice did not mean they should be entitled to do so with impunity.<p>Nobody ever though that nobody would create anything without copyright.

The value of cable was that you could get channels (and thus content) that you could not get from &#x27;over the air&#x27; stations. Early cable adopters people with poor or non-existent over the air reception. Then cable added the equivalent of UHF channels (sorry if that is a US centric thing but all of the channels on that band in the US were a bit &#x27;off&#x27;). Then came the &#x27;movie&#x27; channels which you could <i>only</i> get on cable and the reason people paid for cable was that other content which they had no other way to get.<p>Internet service was never a threat until bandwidth got to the point where you could watch video on it with the same fidelity as bad TV, then suddenly other ways to get alternate content were available. Netflix dropped into that change just as affordable 1 - 3 mbit bandwidth was hitting (the whole ADSL revolution in the 90&#x27;s) and since the bandwidth race that has just gotten worse.<p>So cable, which you paid for, was the only way to get this &quot;other&quot; content, which carried free over-the-air content with its concommitant advertising as a &#x27;favor&#x27; to its subscribers so they didn&#x27;t need an antenna (and they did get better reception, but not HD, but that is a different thread). Now folks are dumping cable for things like Netflix and Hulu because they can get content &quot;ala carte&quot; and Netfix on demand is better than all of the &#x27;budget&#x27; movie channels on cable (think Encore, Starz, or Cinemax) and now they go back to over the air reception (now digital) of the free content. Comcast is disintermediated because they don&#x27;t bring anything to the party (except, to their pain, fast internet access).<p>That is the sea change that is going on here. Fat pipe providers as a commodity, and a bunch of different services being content providers on demand.",1413495267

When you grow up hearing your parents and your preachers and your teachers all telling you that alcohol is okay in moderation (for adults) but that using other drugs is wrong (and thus illegal), that can have a real impact in establishing your moral compass for those issues. Those influences are pretty much the defining source of your community&#x27;s norms and traditions.<p>So if you&#x27;re the sort of person whose inclination or upbringing leads you to strongly honor your elders and their ideals, it&#x27;s not a matter of &quot;irrational circular argument&quot;.

The heart disease risk from smoking probably stems from damage to blood vessels caused by toxins generated in the tobacco burning. &quot;Toxins&quot; is really the best word here, even though it&#x27;s so general. I use it to encompass thousands of different chemicals like free radicals, known carcinogens, etc.<p>Current thinking is the body repairs that damage with clots and cholesterol. But, these repairs accumulate over time to occlude a blood vessel (atherosclerosis). If red blood cells can&#x27;t get through, oxygen can&#x27;t either, and heart cells downstream to the occlusion will die in minutes to hours.<p>Marijuana most likely generates a significant amount of toxins as well. However, marijuana smokers generally smoke less than cigarette smokers. Given that heart disease and cancer risk increases with the amount smoked, it would be reasonable to assume marijuana smokers are much less at risk (though the risk is nonzero). But, we don&#x27;t have a clear conversion between marijuana and cigarette smoke yet. You may also consider that marijuana may be contaminated with other plants or chemicals.<p>Electronic cigarettes are possibly more safe than non-e cigarettes in terms of cancer risk (this is theoretical as no significant study has been done yet). However, some in vitro (cellular) research suggests nicotine may play a role in atherosclerosis discussed above.

The guilds were constructed the way they are because of the in-and-out nature of working in production. Without going into detail, the model just doesn&#x27;t fit unless all devs turn freelance.<p>Now a union, as the states has for many different labor professions etc: this is a concept that could work, but without an effective standardization system (something VERY hard to do in a world of open source, fast moving technology development, and new coding languages) it would be for show and simply an opportunity for the 5% who shook the right hands to sit on their golden thrones.

So this would be inverse to the problem we&#x27;re trying to solve, which is qualification of good devs versus &quot;bad&quot; or under qualified.<p>So what would work? Well if we all started by doing Oracle IT and Microsoft certificates, the furiously patient devs of the world could at least recognize each other for it. Actually... they already sort of do. :-p<p>I think ultimately the next form of standards is going to have to be written by the academic world OR some other government sponsored party of incredibly savvy individuals who&#x27;s entire &quot;business&quot; revolves around standardization testing for devs. Not that there aren&#x27;t companies kind of doing this, but well? And on a government level of respect and reach? Nope.<p>I suppose the only back draw is that it risks removing the creativity and how problem solving abilities are associated to personality type. I&#x27;m sure you could eventually formulate that as well, but sheesh, what data mayhem. Would be awesome.

If, a year from now, someone else, without my permission, reprints my article in a book called “The Most Thoughtful and Penetrating Essays of 2014,” I can complain that my right to make copies is being violated and, if the court agrees with me, legally suppress the book... Although not the author of this piece, you, too, would likely feel that the publisher of “Most Thoughtful Essays” was a bandit.</i><p><i>> But suppose that a Web site ran an item that said something like “This piece on copyright is a great read!” with a hyperlink on the word “piece” to my article’s page on The New Yorker’s Web site. You wouldn’t think this was banditry at all. You would find it unexceptionable.</i><p>I would argue that the latter seems unexceptional because it is qualitatively different than the former.<p>If I pick up an essay from the <i>New Yorker</i> and print it in a book that I then sell, I am depriving the <i>New Yorker</i> of revenue, because now there is a way to get it that doesn&#x27;t involve paying the rights-holder (the <i>New Yorker</i>). This -- taking money out of the hands of the people who own the content to put it in my own -- is what copyright is designed to stop.<p>If I link to an essay on the <i>New Yorker&#x27;s</i> web site from my own web site, I am <i>not</i> depriving them of revenue, because you can only read it by following the link, and the New Yorker is free to put up any financial barriers -- paywalls, ads, etc. -- between you and the endpoint of the link that they wish. So they&#x27;re not losing the opportunity to sell you the content; I&#x27;m not taking money out of their hands. And maybe my endorsement that there&#x27;s good stuff to be found behind the paywall will be the factor that convinces you to pay up.<p>Or, alternately, they can decide to forgo the money they&#x27;d make by forcing you to subscribe in the hopes that they can make more money by showing ads against the content instead. But the crucial point is that it is <i>their</i> decision, not mine. Whereas if I put the essay in a printed book, and then sold it, I am making the decision <i>for</i> them.<p>Where all this breaks down, of course, is in cases where I, the linker, reprint large portions (or all) of the article on my own site in addition to just providing a link. In that case, yes, I am depriving you of revenue, because the reader no longer has to click through to get the meat of the story.

All I&#x27;m allowed to do by the doctrine of fair use (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use</a>) is reprint a small snippet.

8467889,comment,8466011,8466395,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"The problem is the same as it is with print; the subscription fee usually only covers the cost of distribution. The cost of content is typically paid for by advertising, which brings in more than subscriptions do. This CBS streaming service is going to be $6/month. So for each million subscribers they get $6m/mo.<p>But CBS&#x27;s most show, <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, which is the most popular show in the USA in that time slot, pulls in about $6.5 million of ad revenue <i>every episode</i>. So CBS would need 4 million subscribers just to match the revenue stream from that one show. Put another way, they need 50k subscribers to replace the ad revenue from one single 30-second commercial spot on that same show. <a href=""http://www.ibtimes.com/economics-prime-time-how-much-does-it-cost-place-30-second-ad-prime-time-weeknight-tv-show-1424544"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibtimes.com/economics-prime-time-how-much-does-it...</a><p>This is why the economics of TV are so brutal and many shows are canceled after only a few episodes or a single season. It&#x27;s not necessarily the fault of the show itself - if a new show goes up against a much stronger offering from another channel, it may not attract a critical mass of viewers and it&#x27;s more economical to cancel further production and fill the time slot with repeats of more popular material that draws a reliable audience.<p>Now it could be possible for individual shows to break even. I don&#x27;t watch a lot of TV, so I only ever watch one program on CBS, a show called <i>Elementary</i>. I would be willing to consider paying something like $1/episode or $25 for the whole season up front - but that has run for a few years already. For launching a new show with the production value and baseline quality of acting that a commercial audience expects, you probably can&#x27;t get people to pay for it without spending the same amount of money on marketing as on the production itself. So without the cross-subsidies from advertising it would be quite difficult to raise the capital to finance new TV shows. Obviously you have alternatives depending on what sort of show you want to make, eg you can produce a wacky animated comedy relatively cheaply and launch it on YouTube or somesuch to get your initial audience critical mass. But if you want to do an hour-long serious drama or current affairs or science programming, your up front costs are far higher and you need people to open their checkbooks - your MVP probably costs at least $1 million.",1413495133

Global game states and determining the winner/ending the level might need a reliable call.<p>With UDP and only some reliable calls you drastically improve real-time performance with less queueing. TCP is ok for turn-based or near-real-time but high action real-time games almost all use UDP with a RUDP twist. Using a mix can also be harmful [4] so the best option is RUDP where needed, default to UDP.<p>UDP is great because it is a broadcast, almost like TV/radio in that you can show the data you receive and smooth the rest.  Although, TV/radio needs every data frame to prevent static/lag but imagine the broadcaster having to error check all connections, it would quickly saturate. UDP allows saturation later. Games can predict movement and smooth out missing data for most game actions, you only need a few points for a bezier to be smooth or you might have variables for speed/direction/forces that you can predict with. Pretty good reliability and lack of ordering are not really an issue, if out of order (timestamp older than last) discard and use next or predict until the next valid message (too much of this leads to lag but normal UDP operations it is enough and actually smoother).<p>[1] <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-sigtran-reliable-udp-00"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-sigtran-reliable-udp-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/OculusVR/RakNet"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/OculusVR/RakNet</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://enet.bespin.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://enet.bespin.org/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.isoc.org/INET97/proceedings/F3/F3_1.HTM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.isoc.org/INET97/proceedings/F3/F3_1.HTM</a>",1413495025

I wrote a fairly detailed critique of it, back in the day, which is now lost to history, but the gist was, &quot;Murry doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of making his case regarding IQ and race.&quot;<p>For one, &quot;race&quot; is a very slippery concept, and as a social construction is so deeply correlated with other determinants of well-being in the US that any imputation that it is an independent causal factor is problematic at best. Murry doesn&#x27;t do a great job of untangling these effects.<p>For two, as applied to populations, IQ isn&#x27;t necessarily more than a measure of general well-being. Alternative measures of IQ correlate pretty well with the Stanford-Binet, but you know what else does? Grip strength. The strength of your hands correlates about as well with your standard IQ score as various alternative IQ measures. The most plausible explanation for this is that all these measures are metrics of well-being, not &quot;general intelligence&quot;.<p>The very notion that &quot;general intelligence&quot; is a measurable property, like height, rather than a complex multi-variate phenomenon that cannot be unproblematically reduced to a single number is worth taking seriously.<p>Murray seems mostly unconcerned by all that, and insufficiently aggressive about looking for ways of challenging his own hypotheses.",1413493871

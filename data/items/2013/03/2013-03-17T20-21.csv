5391022,comment,5390726,5390919,7,0,igravious,,,"There is a growing realization that cognition is fundamentally _embodied_ cognition. If you think of the mind as an ethereal entity removed of its physicality (or at the very least made out of a different substance from the body - that is to say, substance dualism) then it is easy to imagine the following scenarios. Containers are unimportant, so minds can be uploaded and downloaded, whether machine or human the housing is unimportant.<p>If we come to accept cognition as fundamentally embodied then it becomes less sensible to compare cognition across differing architectures - human cognition will always be quite unlike any other type of cognition except itself. I think machines will have consciousness (why should they not be able to, what is so special about us that would limit this phenomenon to us?) but it will be a machine consciousness and radically different from ours.<p>I think we're going to have to get a lot more fine-grained about how we talk about features and functions of brains whether human or machine. You've already put ""smarter"" in quotes which shows that already you're aware of how blunt and crude our terms are.<p>Does this all seem reasonable?",1363553976

5391020,comment,5390420,5390841,3,0,akiselev,,,"The obstacle of going to Mars has long since been a problem of desire and not technology. Obviously better radiation shielding, drugs that reduce the negative effects of zero-g, nuclear propulsion, and other technologies would reduce the risk of failure but at the end of the day going to Mars is a massive engineering and logistics problem.<p>A good analogy (I think) would be the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza. Sure it is trivial to build today with our technology, as (I hope) it will be trivial to travel to Mars in the distant future, but the reason its a great wonder of the world is because, despite a lack of modern technology, it was built as a national engineering project that spanned decades. Just like a mission to Mars, it was a daunting task (one that required a generation or two of slaves perhaps) that was pulled off through pure grit.",1363553908

Perhaps the only overlap would be Mathematics, but that's the foundation for pretty much everything.<p>Shantanu - You're right. Simply throwing money cannot solve global issues and no single person including Mr. Gates and Mr. Buffett combined have the monetary resources at their disposal to tackle even 5% of global issues. However, they're the right kind of people to take on sociological challenges and eradicating diseases because there's a lot more to the problem than that. For instance, bureaucracy, corruption, beliefs, natural causes, etc. I was really surprised (shouldn't have been) to learn that a significant portion of their funds are allocated for dealing with corrupt governments for our mission to globally eradicate diseases like Polio, Malaria, HIV, TB, etc. With my limited experience in that realm, I can state that the problem is definitely way more complex than it appears at the surface (and I think you get that as well).",1363553599

5390995,comment,5390138,5390138,6,0,orionblastar,,,"I am 44 years old, I ended up on disability in 2003 and haven't worked a job ever since. I have two degrees one in computer science and one in business management. I earned the later after I was disabled and graduated with honors. I suffer from schizo-affective disorder and when I developed that mental illness I lost 95% of my friends and family who basically abandoned me, and wrote me off as a loser and failure. I lost my job and my career was basically ruined as well.<p>I learned over 37 different programming languages over 30 years of my life, and most if not all are obsolete. Like Turbo Pascal, FORTRAN, COBOL, ADA, 8086 Assembly Language, JCL/JECL, etc. Yes I worked with a variety of different operating systems and computers. Even mainframes and minicomputers as well as many old 8 bit microcomputers, etc.<p>Pointers, basically some modern languages did away with them. It seems one has to learn how computer memory works to figure out how to use a pointer, and for that one has to learn how a computer works. But if they can eliminate pointers and direct access in modern languages then more people can learn how to program. Many programmers forgot to set their pointers and ended up with a null pointer that may have been set to the address of 0 (system memory) or may have been set to some random address that happened to be in the memory the location of the pointer is stored at. Basically a pointer holds a memory address to a block of memory that data is being stored at. But it seems to be too complex for most people to understand. Back in my days in learning Pascal and Pre-ANSI C it was required to learn.<p>Anyway don't feel like you are a loser or a failure, just learn from your mistakes and failures and then keep trying until you get better. That is how we human beings learn. It is how we learned to walk as infants. We fell down a lot, had to crawl first, but basically we put one foot in front of the other and learned how to keep our balance and walk. But we don't remember all the times trying to walk that we failed and made mistakes.<p>Startups are like that too, I want to share a link to a blog. Some flag it as offtopic because it talks about mental illnesses and technology and startups, yet when others post those same things it makes the front page.

5390994,comment,5382601,5385132,3,0,spion,,,"Deliberate practice is all about pushing yourself outside your current comfort zone. In programming, that might mean things like learning a language such as Haskell, or making a DSL. Solving problems completely different than the ones you usually solve or trying completely different methods. Solving problems you think of as ""hard"".<p>Or even better, try to solve problems you think of as tedious in ways that are not tedious. I always find it strange that so many programmers complain about boring grunt work. There is a perfect opportunity there to invent tools that optimize and speed up this boring grunt work. The next level is to make those tools work in a way that is usable and intuitive for other programmers. The end result is worth gold (or glory, depending on what you're after)<p>Good practice is all about doing hard things. Doing the same things that you can already do perfectly (both in music and programming) leads to no improvement. Doing things you consider hard leads to amazingly quick improvement.<p>Musicians that concentrate on practicing only the hard and unpolished parts of their performance are more effective than the ones that practice both the easy and the hard parts. Those musicians that have found a way to  ""modularize"" their practice and split it to the tiniest most focused bits are the most successful ones. (This is not easy because beyond a certain point the flow of the music is lost)<p>In programming we must do both the easy and the hard parts, but we can turn the easy parts into hard by writing code to make them even easier or to completely eliminate them.",1363553546

Heroku's recommendation has always been that you're supposed to write your ""app servers"" to serve A-type requests directly, while asynchronously queuing your B-type requests to be consumed by workers. You then either poll the app server for the completion state of the long requests, or have the worker queue a return-value paired to the request-ID, that the app server can dequeue and return along with the next request.

It was definitely of the 'my code is haunted, that's the only explanation' variety -- audio files that were discarded were still faintly audible in the background. I read that article, sat down at my computer, stepped through my code in the debugger again and realized that I was setting my audio stream format to 2 channels/interleaved whilst converting to a mono stream. So, whenever I filled the buffer with a new audio file, my file-length parameter was incorrect, and some bytes were never freed. Because the files are all close to same length, I never noticed the issue before. It only surfaced when I parameterized the 'grain duration' in the engine. The irony is that just yesterday a friend was asking about getting started in Core Audio and the advice I offered was to spend a lot of time learning about Audio Stream Basic Descriptions, because they're usually the cause of most problems.",1363553171

At that point there simply is no way that you can get out because the interest of the debt alone is impossible to be paid without contracting more and more debt.<p>That is what happened to Greece, for example, where a state default took place.<p>Now people know that states are going to default so nobody wants to buy government bonds anymore: so the states are basically forcing the banks to buy govt bonds (with a last resort using the BCE as a ""bad bank"").<p>So when a country defaults, lots of banks are suddenly virtually bankrupt: they either need a bail-out or go bankrupt. Should they go bankrupt that would deal a huge blow to the economy.  Nobody wants Deutsche Bank or BNP Paribas going down: that would probably mean civil war and the end of the western world as we know it.<p>So states are basically forced to bail out these banks.

Sending people there with the explicit expectation to die soon speaks of poor planning and not a lot of willingness to export the basic tenets of humanity into space with us. It's a bad precedent, it carries the wrong message about the value of intelligent life, and I'm afraid the mission's limitations also impact its overall chances of success.<p>Although we have experienced a sad regression in our space capabilities, there is nothing in principle preventing us from sending humans and basic building blocks there, let them build a decent base, and then instate a regular shuttling service. Even if building the outpost takes 10 years, that's not the same as sending them onto a suicide mission as the article implies.<p>We're missing a lot of necessary infrastructure for this though, and without it the stated Sept. 2022 launch date might as well be 2122 or even 4022. We'll need a moon base to stage this thing (not only the initial flight but more importantly the supply line), and if we're serious about expanding into the solar system, one or two space elevators are probably a necessity. The political will to build any of these, never mind maintaining them, does not exist. We're too busy propping up corrupt political and financial systems, not to mention the importance of waging an eternal war the expenses of which could provide enough for a decent colonialization program many times over.<p>Scraping together a suicide team and shooting it roughly in Mars' general direction is not the answer to this problem.",1363550730

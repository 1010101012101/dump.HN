In that case the huge FLOP/s count will only be realized in &quot;high orders,&quot; that is when these spectral methods are pushed to their limits - in which case much existing research today breaks down and the methods can simply become unusable by e.g. yielding a &#x27;theoretically&#x27; invertible matrix that has a numerically infinite condition number; no amount of fourier transforms can dig you out of that hole. This problem is not fully understood in the spectral method literature, and it rears its face in many different ways depending on the problem context.<p>GPUs have a similar problem, their ability to churn out dense linear algebra operations at high scale is so good that the vast majority of algorithms have a huge memory bottleneck, not a FLOP/s bottleneck. The result is people rarely see the insane promised 100X speedup of their simulation codes because they rarely are one massive dense linear algebra operation such as a matrix-matrix multiply, but rather a combination of small dense linear algebra ops + memory bound operations  like gathers and scatters. Ironically spectral methods also work very well on the GPU in high orders, because they effectively replace memory bound operations with dense linear algebra operations - which the GPU eats for breakfast, but again: high orders -> still an unsolved area of simulation mathematics; a lot of things happen which we don&#x27;t have the answer for and they frequently disrupt the method from being applicable.<p>As someone who uses spectral methods every day I would love to see this optical device work and therefore hopefully really push research hard on resolving some of its problems. I suspect its initial use will be limited to specialized problems, however.",1407731808

The Kindle store does not make very much money, in fact Amazon does not make much money from selling things because they sell them as cheap as they can almost at cost or in some cases below costs like their Kindle tablets.

8161903,comment,8161322,8161322,1,0,couchand,,,"In addition to the criticisms raised by others (the most important of which is significance!), I&#x27;d add that the dots are a poor way to demonstrate the pay gap.  People are notoriously bad at estimating area, particularly when the variance is so small.  The only reason pie charts are acceptable is that you double encode the metric in area and central angle.<p>Here you are trying to demonstrate the ratio between two values: the average pay of women versus men.  However, the dimension encoding this metric is overall area, so the fact that this is a ratio is obscured.  Perhaps worse, the areas are misleading: WY pays its women 37% less than men, yet the dot is barely visible, far smaller than 63% of the area of the circle (which would be the intuitive explanation); likewise, it looks (on the scale to the right) that even 100% pay equality is represented by an incomplete circle.<p>Also, it looks like you&#x27;re plotting DC but it&#x27;s basically impossible to click on to see the data; for that matter RI, CT and MA are pretty hard to deal with.<p>It seems like you&#x27;re using a force-based layout for the charts, which I take to mean that the states aren&#x27;t accurately placed.  Please don&#x27;t move data points around to suit aesthetic concerns.<p>Okay, enough negativity, some positives.  I quite like the scales to the right.  Some may complain about the animation, but I think that&#x27;s valuable object constancy in action.  It makes it quite intuitive what&#x27;s happening when rolling over the various states.  I also like the use of left/right to represent the political lean.<p>However: it isn&#x27;t at all clear where the ends of the scales are and why they were chosen.  The arrowhead makes estimating the length of the political lean bars difficult.  The fact that they are offset by the width of the circle makes comparison around the middle impossible, and comparison elsewhere hard.<p>Is this data geographically related?  If not, a choropleth is probably not the right solution.  The fact that you&#x27;re charting state-based data is not enough to justify a geographical representation.<p>EDIT: the most important aspect of a data visualization is the message.  Don&#x27;t just try to make something pretty: think long and hard about what you are trying to convey.  And add text!  An explanation is required to make an interesting visualization comprehensible.  If a visualization is completely understandable without an iota of text, the message is probably entirely obvious without the visualization.",1407730494

Well there is a cap  and one reason is probably because opening the gates wide open will skew the job market in US. For better or for worse it is hard to say but if you ask those in US they might say for worse.<p>So there is a cap. (And obviously it is being pushed against, there is demand, you wanted to work for Apple, others want to work for other companies and so on). So how to you fix the problem?<p>I can see these things as possible solutions:<p>1) First come first serve. That would be interesting, each year on a midnight of a particular date. Some server or some office in DC will will swamped with thousands of instantaneous requests. In less than 1 second it will all be over. Those with servers closer to the facility or those that have better synchronized clocks will win. Or put everyone in a long queue maybe and just wait year to year. Watch the queue extend for decades.<p>2) Make it an auction. So now each spot initially costs some processing fee to handle. Then well do first come first serve but increase the fee according to the demand. Maybe it takes $2k for initial spot. And $200k for last available.<p>> Since the job required me to be in Cupertino, the deal simply fell through.<p>Shouldn&#x27;t you also blame Apple here too, at least just a bit. Presumably if there is this huge talent pool abroad they would at least consider opening an office in EU or let you work remotely in some capacity. Tech sector is interesting because that becomes possible (and has been done). I don&#x27;t quite understand their position either.

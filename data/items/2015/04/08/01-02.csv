The call (~45 minutes) was spent doing a programming exercise involving string manipulation where the interviewer was essentially silent, while I dealt with the details of getting string manipulation on C correct (the actual problem was trivial from an algorithm standpoint, and could be banged out in python or a similar language in ~10 minutes with access to a REPL to check the details). I wasn&#x27;t about to try to remember the proper syntax for another language on the fly (especially since the interviewer didn&#x27;t want me to use anything other than a shared text buffer during the interview), and didn&#x27;t have the prototypes for various string-related functions memorized, so I&#x27;d bet I came across as incompetent in the reviewers eyes.<p>Never mind the fact that they could have asked interesting questions about how I wrote a rather complex piece of an IP stack from scratch recently, and successfully deployed it to various customers.<p>I suppose if you have a big enough candidate pool and a reasonable compensation package, you&#x27;ll find someone acceptable with this approach - but you&#x27;ll spend a lot of interviewer-hours doing it.

9338325,comment,9338071,9338198,0,0,deathanatos,,,"I was also thinking this would be related to DST. The &quot;tricky&quot; bit about Australia is that DST is &quot;backwards&quot;, at least compared to those of us in the northern hemisphere. Because the seasons are reversed from those north of the equator, DST is also likewise reversed. They spring forward in October, and fall back in April. It all should make sense when you think about it. (Longer days are still in the summer, and thus DST is still in the summer.) This is of course not unique to Australia. (I think they just happen to crop up probabilistically by having a high population using technology, and are south of the equator.)<p>The cool bit, at least to me, is that the mnemonic &quot;spring forward&quot; still works. Likely, this is only cool to me because the whole thing is unusual.<p>The other odd bit is that some TZs sit on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of the international date line, and thus get interesting offsets such as +13 or +14h from UTC. I think there&#x27;s some that are -13h too, so the total &quot;length&quot; of day (that is, how long you could remain on a calendar date) is >48h. Thus, at any given time, people in their local time are in as many as three different calendar dates.<p>There&#x27;s also a few TZs with half-hour offsets. (e.g., they&#x27;re something like 4.5 hours off UTC.) There&#x27;s a 3-hour TZ jump at one point on China&#x27;s border, I think, because all of China is on a single timezone, and the nation is quite wide, east-to-west.<p>We&#x27;ve not even gotten to leap seconds, or that 2100 won&#x27;t be a leap year.<p>And governments regularly muck with this stuff. The set of timezones and their offsets and DST preferences are constantly changing.",1428457230

Now, would it be the best language for that?  Depends.  If you&#x27;re looking just for speed and massive computations, then no.  In the end, C++ pretty much rules everything in that regard (except for maybe Fortran in some instances).  But, I would say that it might be more fun to set it up in Erlang/Elixir.  And you could pretty easily expand the whole thing just by adding more processors and simply telling it to spawn more processes (the Erlang VM is pretty awesome).

If we recall context; we&#x27;re discussing a person who has allowances made for his religious observance, and that process being described by someone else as effectively pandering to his mental illness at an organisational cost.<p>That is, why should an allowance be made for him to go to church at 3pm, but not for Mitch in sales to go gambling at 3pm? At least gambling offers the potential for a return. By the interpretation under discussion, which is not entirely without merit, religion is just a mental illness that people unfortunately fall into. Why should it be encouraged or facilitated by workplaces or allow for the abrogation of duties which they would otherwise have on the same level as raising a family which is indisputably essential for the continuance of society?",1428455006

It&#x27;s a common problem. Here is my advice... accept that you can&#x27;t do everything. (This is reality and it catches up with you soon enough anyway). Find out what is important and focus on that. Just that. Don&#x27;t worry about what other people are doing. It has absolutely zero impact on what you are doing. In life, people will make more money than you. Others will make less. Some will be happier, some less happy. It doesn&#x27;t matter. At all. It&#x27;s you that you should be concerned about. Why are you chasing tech? What is the end game? That&#x27;s the question.<p>Do one thing, or a few things, and do them well. If you aren&#x27;t going to do that, then don&#x27;t do these things and accept that you aren&#x27;t going to do them and don&#x27;t worry about it. Don&#x27;t flit. There is a cost associated with switching tasks and that makes the whole thing harder.",1428454947

Warrants will generally be granted, and the search of any particular individual is going to happen if the government wants it to.</i><p>Yes, but at the time the Constitution was written warrants were a requirements for a search. If a British officer showed up on your property and demanded to search it without a warrant you could literally shoot him.<p>This led to the issuance of &quot;general warrants,&quot; allowing British officers to search entire houses and estates. The Fourth Amendment was a direct reaction to that, which is enshrined in the language &quot;no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.&quot;<p>But you conveniently left out the most important part: the rationale at the beginning of the Amendment: &quot;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,[a] against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated&quot;<p>The <i>whole purpose</i> of the Amendment was to protect individuals from government searches. The text says so right on its face: <i>&quot;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated...&quot;</i><p>The exclusionary rule or &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree&quot; doctrine, with which you seem to be confusing the Amendment itself, is a twentieth century invention of the Warren court.",1428454923

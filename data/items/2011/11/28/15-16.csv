He said that there was virtually no chance that a cell phone would cause any interference. He said that as far as he could tell the FAA rules stemmed from the FCC that stemmed from the cell carries pressuring the FCC not to allow it. The reason he suggested was that cell phones at altitude have line-of-sight to dozens of cell towers. As airplanes full of cell phones fly through the air they associate and disassociate with cell towers very quickly. The towers have to switch the handsets from tower to tower more quickly than usual causing a lot of network traffic signaling overhead between cell sites.

3286307,comment,3279079,3279079,2,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Riak is interesting, but its performance characteristics are unfortunately interesting in a negative sense.<p>First, single-node performance is awful. You would think that even on a single node, simple key/value lookup would be able to compete against something like Postgres; after all, the read pipeline should be much simpler. But it doesn't come close, in my testing. Not just key/value lookups; it's also dog slow at chasing links, and scales very badly with the number of links.<p>Now, Riak is intended to be deployed on many nodes, but in my testing with three nodes I did not see a significant increase in performance. The overhead seemed to be constant. In a master-less, distributed database, some compromise on performance is acceptable, but Riak looks much worse than would be acceptable.<p>Riak is focused on random access. Sequential access similar to that offered by Cassandra and HBase just won't scale beyond a few hundred objects. This problem is made worse by the fact that a Riak ""bucket"" isn't really a bucket, but a namespace; all data in a Riak database resides in the same storage, and bucket operations simply filter that data based on the bucket name. This means that any sequential access is off the table.<p>The Riak people suggest using links in order to emulate sequential access patterns and entity relationships. For example, if you want to blog post with bunch of comments, you would store the post in one key, and then comments in other keys, and then use child/parent links to glue them together. Unfortunately, this seems to scale very badly with the number of objects linked.<p>Not just read performance, either; it seems links are stored in a single chunk whenever an object stored, so when adding a single child, you have to write all children back to the object! Obviously that does not scale to thousands or even millions of objects. For a database that has no other means to deal with relationships, the weakness of the link feature is serious.<p>After all, you would face the same problem if you stored the list of objects as a key value (you have to rewrite the entire object every time, since Riak does not have partial updates), and since it's not feasible to scan keys based on prefix, for example, you end up with no alternative. I suppose you can use Riak Search, but last I checked it was built on top of Solr, which is not fast.<p>There are various minor annoyances, too. For example, unlike Cassandra, there is no operation to delete the entire contents of a bucket -- something which you want to do before/after unit tests --, so you have to sequentially enumerate the bucket's keys and delete each one, something which is just excruciatingly slow.<p>Here is a test case I wrote in Ruby to test performance: <a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12091499/Share/riaktest.tar.gz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12091499/Share/riaktest.tar.gz</a>. It contains a script to test similar operations/queries against Postgres. The included Riak test results are for a three-node dedicated test cluster (plenty of CPU, RAM, I/O). I am open to the possibility that the config needs tuning, of course.",1322495276

It is very difficult to explain this without math, but some of the important points are:<p>IF the Higgs Boson exists, it interacts with the usual matter. The main part of the interaction is the (apparent) mass.<p>The Higgs field is not constant, we can think about the irregularities in the field are particles, this particles are the Higgs Bosons.<p>The experiments in the LHC are trying to measure how this Higgs Bosons bounce with the usual particles, how the Higgs Bosons are created from usual particles and how the Higgs Bosons splits in a few usual particles.<p>The experiments try to get an isolated Higgs Bosons for a very small time, because they are not stable (perhaps 10^-20 seconds?). It is impossible to see it during that small time, so the experiments analyze the particles that are created after the Higgs Boson splits.<p>All the process is very difficult and noisy, so the experiments have to run for a few years.

This went so far as Roman Catholic services being held in Latin until IIRC the 1960s;<p>- Prior to the printing press, books were the province of monks and the like so being educated (in Western Europe) involved speaking Latin;<p>- In England, Latin was the language of court and the law for centuries. There are many Latin terms--even in American law--for a reason;<p>- Latin was the language of science. Element names in chemistry, species names in biology and so on have Latin roots;<p>- For centuries, Latin was the <i>lingua franca</i> of the ruling class of Europe.<p>The short of it is that being able to speak, read and write Latin in medieval and Renaissance Europe was <i>power</i>. More to the point, if you didn't know Latin, you were essentially excluded from many things (as many people were). Knowing Latin had as much power and influence as literacy in general.<p>So what the author is saying is the ability ""speak"" the language of computers, the ability to communicate with them and make them do things, is the 21st century version of the thrall once held by Latin.<p>Many have spoken about how expensive it was to launch a dot-com company in the 90s and how that cost has essentially decreased by <i>two</i> orders of magnitude in a decade. One might have thought this would make engineers less valuable as our skills would've been commoditized to some degree.<p>The converse has happened. While other costs have largely vanished, more businesses became possible that never were before.

That its value and demand is great speaks for what a great piece of art it is.<p>Whether the mind perceiving an object is trained to comprehend what is perceived is a different issue from whether the nature of the object can be perceived at all. This is why much of ""modern art"" is accompanied by several pages of explanation: given the education required, the audience has at least a hope of comprehending what is striking the senses. 4'33"" makes some kind of sense given preliminary background/training; ""Thidreks"" is great literature if one but learns Old Norwegian; a viewer may be persuaded Pollock's paintings are great art ... in all cases, the material is there for perception, and is what it is regardless of training. Most viewers may be unable to discern the Hope Diamond from like-shaped glass, but that's not the cutter's problem - the outstanding beauty is there for the viewing, stifled only by the viewer's mind. You're hard-pressed to fake the Hope Diamond, and a solid fake WOULD share the artistry outside of the intrinsic value.<p>In this case, there is NOTHING in the exhibit for the audience to perceive. No application of senses can reveal what's there. Plugging it into a computer for conversion to perceptible form may reveal its intrinsic value, but as there is nothing to perceive otherwise then there is no art any more than sticking the Mona Lisa into a welded-shut steel box, covering a sculpture with a tarp, or displaying the Hope Diamond before it was cut to shape.",1322494368

I'm actually a bit surprised this sentiment hasn't been expressed more often, but I guess it's part of the bubble a lot of Valley entrepeneurs live in. I am just a 25-year old guy working as a regular employee in a small consulting company with flexible hours and freedom to take unpaid leave pretty much whenever I feel like it, but I have some pretty strong opinions on parts of the startup culture.<p>To be frank, it seems like a lot of startup employees suffer from OCD (literally). Working really long hours and improving the product, changing the world etc. is what it's always about. Lots of people seem to lose sight of the ultimate goal in life, which is being happy. Or maybe they didn't have a goal in the first place, and working really hard is a substitute for something else which is missing in their lives.<p>Unhealthily hard work is a good idea _for a period of time_, if it _seems as if it's working_, as a means to an end: Making a lot of money in a few years instead of throughout a lifetime, creating something of your own and leaving your mark on the world, reaching your true potential, etc. But if you're working 12 hours a day for _years_ with nothing to show for it, you are on the wrong track and should take a step back.<p>I realized this after experiencing burnout at 19, spending two years where I was capable of doing absolutely nothing traditionlly productive. Therefore, it's really surprising to me that a lot of supposedly older and wiser do this rat race for years, losing sight of the goal along the way.<p>Pushing really hard to achieve something great is a huge risk to your mental well-being, and this is something you should go into with both eyes open. It's better to make a tactical retreat if things seem too hard.<p>You can be perfectly happy not being a Steve Jobs. In fact, if it doesn't come naturally, you're almost guaranteed to be happier by being a little easier on yourself.",1322493518

In fact Lean is nearly synonymous with TQM, or Total Quality Management. If you've separated the two, then you've missed the entire point.<p>This tenet is carried over into the software world by Martin Fowler in his book Continuous Delivery, as well as all of the major advocates of lean software processes, for instance David Anderson and the Poppendiecks in their highly influential series of books on Lean Software.<p>Essential to a successful continuous deployment process is unit testing, continuous integration and built-in testing processes all along the way to feature deployment. These should be focused on quality all along the way: that's the point of continuous deployment, to allow for focused feature development that is highly tested and can be released with higher confidence than the old method of multiple feature release, which are heavy, harder to test and have more integration concerns.<p>The point of fast releases should <i>never</i> be to allow for ""shitty software,"" but rather to deliver features that users can enjoy as soon as possible, create a process where deployments become highly automated, low-risk events, and gather feedback early and often on the experience of users with finished <i>polished</i> features so that effective product evaluation is happening constantly and the company can adapt quicker to new data and new trends.<p>A quick perusal of even the first chapter of <i>any</i> of the major volumes on Continuous Delivery should clear this up:<p><a href=""http://martinfowler.com/snips/201006021426.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martinfowler.com/snips/201006021426.html</a>\n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Lean-Software-Development-Agile-Toolkit/dp/0321150783/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1322492548&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Lean-Software-Development-Agile-Toolki...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Lean-Software-Development-Concept/dp/0321437381"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Lean-Software-Development...</a><p>And there's a fantastic presentation by David Anderson on Kanban on InfoQ, which nicely illustrates why quality is one of the major reasons you should consider a rapid release process like Kanban:<p><a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/kanban-for-software"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/kanban-for-software</a>",1322492984

3286111,comment,3283768,3285867,2,0,lucasjung,,,"><i>millions of flights have been conducted in the cell phone era without an issue.</i><p>First of all, this is not true.  I have read aviation safety reports that cite consumer electronics as a contributing factor.  Second of all, the fact that no <i>major</i> mishap has been attributed to consumer electronics is probably due in large part to the controls in place.  There may be a few individuals who don't care about safety who disregard the rules, but as long as the overwhelming majority of passengers comply, the chances of an incident are dramatically reduced.<p>Aviators are tought a ""swiss cheese"" model of mishaps: there are safety precautions in place (equipment, procedures, etc.) to prevent mishaps, which you can visualize as slices of swiss cheese, with holes in them.  The holes represent things that prevent a particular precaution from working properly: broken equipment, failure to comply with procedures, etc.  A hazard might make it past one precaution by slipping through one of these holes, but then get stopped by some other precaution.  A mishap occurs when enough holes line up in a row for a hazard to get all of the way through.  In most mishaps, there are three holes that lined up to make the mishap happen.  For example, bad weather alone would probably not cause a mishap, nor would a hyrdaulic malfunction alone or a slightly low fuel load alone, but when you get all three together, shit gets out of hand and a mishap can happen.  On a flight where nothing else goes wrong, consumer electronics alone are not going to cause a mishap, but on a flight where a couple of other things are going wrong, a single cell phone might be all it takes to tip the scales from ""a really bad day for the pilots"" to ""mishap.""<p>><i>Please stop the fear mongering on this.</i><p>I have personally experienced degradation of safety-critical systems in-flight due to EMI from on-board devices, including devices that are not designed to be transmitters.  Nothing you carry onto a plane is going to cause it to explode without warning or go completely out of control (which are a couple of straw-men I have seen in this topic).  What can, and does, happen, is that safety-critical avionics don't work right.  During critical phases of flight (takeoff, departure, approach, and landing), this could be a contributor to a mishap.  If your ILS goes haywire when you're in the middle of shooting an approach in actual IMC, you've got a big problem; likewise, if you can't talk on certain radio frequencies in the terminal area due to noise interference, you've got a problem.<p>><i>I put it into WiFi only mode about 10 minutes after takeoff when I can't get a signal anymore and just turn it back on when we are a half hour within landing.</i><p>If you have a GSM phone, then allow me to speak for every pilot you have ever been a passenger to: fuck you.  No, really: fuck you.  Put your GSM phone next to a cheap set of speakers: it will periodically make a noise (especially if you are sending/receiving calls or data, or if your phone is searching for the network).  The same thing happens with most ILS receivers and with the ICS on many planes.  So first, they'll have to use some other approach rather than ILS, which may not have been their primary plan.  Then, imagine trying to run checklists and land a plane with that shit going off in your ears.<p>Even if you have a CDMA phone, there's a good chance you're interfering with something, making the lives of your pilots that much harder at a time when they can ill afford additional distractions.",1322492813

As a vim pre-novice, I think that part of BBEdit's appeal is that the features you may not use often enough to remember a command for are just a little mouse-hunting away. Having used Textmate a couple of time and the somewhat similar e.exe for Windows a lot, the appeal of BBEdit is that features are integrated into the application instead of loosely coupled in bundles that may or may not work well.",1322492663

I find this title ""Coding - the new Latin"" as a bizarre way of inducing people to learn to code.<p>Latin is dead. Very dead. Back in my day Latin was billed as ""The Fastest Growing Language"", but that never transpired.<p>Now if you want to read Caesar, Virgil, Catulus et al, then fine learn Latin. But Latin is no longer the ticket to an elite private members club that it once was.<p>Latin - is also a language that you exclusively read. There is so little creative element to it. One furthers oneself in Latin by re/interpreting existing works.<p>Coding - is a creative craft where you take instructions and make something that never existed before.<p>It would be better to strap coding onto something intensely creative:<p><pre><code>  Technical Drawing\n  Metal Work\n  Fine Art, Sculpture</code></pre>",1322492422

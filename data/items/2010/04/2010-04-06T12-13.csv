More than half of the stock exchange's trades are made by high frequency traders.<p>There are ups and downs and each situation should be weighed individually.<p>Overall, I'd say the epiphany that the author had is sadly something that many people miss.

So I quietly sat and enjoyed the excellent presentation.<p>At the first break the MS hero took his microphone off and 6 of the other people in the row stood up instantly and quite literally skipped towards the podium forming an MVP wall of knowledge around the hero. On their way back I could see several of them proudly sporting MVP shirts and one of the others I recognised as another MVP that I had some knowledge of.<p>At the time I cringed a little, these guys were all blatantly trying to befriend this poor MS superstar as well as try to outsmart him on several topics that were unrelated to the presentation. The introductions that went along the lines of ""Hi, I’m John Smith, MVP of XXX"" accompanied by the longing look of ""Please please know who I am"" made me smile inside.<p>Next break arrived, MS man popped his microphone down again and... yup, the same six jumped up again along with another couple of folk.<p>The Most Valued Phanboy program is an excellent way of rewarding the good in the MS community, but after witnessing this I have to say that I was a little bit disgusted at the behaviour of these MVP’s. Rather than make it look like a fantastic gang of helpful product experts they succeeded in making it look like a really unwelcoming clique.<p>Obviously this is my view of one event and undoubtedly not representative of the community as a whole.",1270558183
1244453,comment,1243842,1244362,0,0,dsplittgerber,,,"Stating that Wikileaks has not uncovered any meaningful information is quite a stretch. It's true that WaPo and NYT have already covered most of the factual details of the incident - the WaPo reporter was supposedly embedded with the troups arriving on the scene shortly afterwards.<p>You're mixing up your timeline. Reuters staff were able to view the material released by US Central Command (military investigation write-up and selected photographs) and also the video itself once, before they were told to file an FOIA request for it, but their FOIA request for the video was rejected multiple times. The relevant question remained whether the shootings were justified under Rules Of Engagement and also whether what the military stated was true.<p>I think it is similar to reading about how torture is going on and seeing actual photos of it. To accurately assess what exactly went on, a military investigation write-up is quite different from the actual gunship video.<p>I agree that one may have quarrels with Wikileaks' methods. But please differentiate between their methods and the material they release.<p>From NYT 07/13/07: “There is no question that coalition forces were clearly engaged in combat operations against a hostile force,” said Lt. Col. Scott Bleichwehl, a spokesman for the multinational forces in Baghdad.""

He can't engage him because he's unarmed, so he wants him to go for some kind of a weapon because he wants to put the guy out of his misery.",1270555464

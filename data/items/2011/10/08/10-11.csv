Ill respond to a few of the specific points above in a bit to clarify or address things as I see them (which is my opinion and not that of the foundation, to be clear<p>Generally, yes, the design should appear more raspberry in colour then it seems here. By that I mean, not quite red, but definitely not purple. This is my fault for designing in CYMK on a wide-gamut monitor calibrated for print and then not checking the colour profile was set properly on other monitors when exported from EPS. Looks like RGB #e7113c is closer to what Id expect. Mea culpa.<p>If Ive underplayed the Pi/Pie aspect, it because the ideas I tried along those lines always ended up too fussy and indistinct and I felt that the Raspi needed something that would be eye-catching, friendly and recognisable worldwide even when photocopied badly in one colour and without any supporting text.<p>While you cant please all the people all the time, I did go for something simple enough to have room to grow. Its be easy as pie to anthropomorphise (yknow, for kids) and some people have already seen this, which makes me smile<p>Influence wise, it might help to think of it as the love child of the Apple logo and Bibendum. <a href=""http://guru.gg/lovechild.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guru.gg/lovechild.png</a><p>* delete as appropriate.",1318071239

A windowing graphical user interface is objectively easier to use for most people than alternatives at the time, for example. But he saw it at Xerox, recognized it for what it was, refined it until it was sharp and crisp, and made such an impression that everyone followed suit. How long would it have taken otherwise? How many failed attempts and how many iterations? How many more failed tablets and how many more incremental improvements on feature phones? It's not like it only happened once.<p>Anyway, you may very well disagree. I was just trying to explain why some people who think differently might be more than a little sad about it. And that just because he was a stranger doesn't limit the amount of sadness people may legitimately feel.",1318070177

What would make me buy your laptop (even with shipping from the UK to Germany) would be the assurance that everything, including suspend-to-ram, works 100% on the laptops you sell.

You can't make any assertions about the behaviour of the system if only one part of it is verified.<p>The way to verify the entire system is not to verify that quantum physics works; that doesn't help.

2297712,comment,2296550,2297636,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Rather than link you to an individual study, here is a link to an NYT Magazine article that summarizes many studies about how the attitudes of high-SES (""rich kids"") students are more highly valued (""better"") than those of middle class and poor kids. You can find all of the primary source studies via the article.<p>""In her book “Unequal Childhoods,” published in 2003, Lareau described the costs and benefits of each approach and concluded that the natural-growth method had many advantages. Concerted cultivation, she wrote, “places intense labor demands on busy parents. ... Middle-class children argue with their parents, complain about their parents’ incompetence and disparage parents’ decisions.” Working-class and poor children, by contrast, “learn how to be members of informal peer groups. They learn how to manage their own time. They learn how to strategize.” But outside the family unit, Lareau wrote, the advantages of “natural growth” disappear. In public life, the qualities that middle-class children develop are consistently valued over the ones that poor and working-class children develop. Middle-class children become used to adults taking their concerns seriously, and so they grow up with a sense of entitlement, which gives them a confidence, in the classroom and elsewhere, that less-wealthy children lack. The cultural differences translate into a distinct advantage for middle-class children in school, on standardized achievement tests and, later in life, in the workplace.<p>...The disadvantages that poverty imposes on children aren’t primarily about material goods. True, every poor child would benefit from having more books in his home and more nutritious food to eat (and money certainly makes it easier to carry out a program of concerted cultivation). But the real advantages that middle-class children gain come from more elusive processes: the language that their parents use, the attitudes toward life that they convey. However you measure child-rearing, middle-class parents tend to do it differently than poor parents — and the path they follow in turn tends to give their children an array of advantages. As Lareau points out, kids from poor families might be nicer, they might be happier, they might be more polite — but in countless ways, the manner in which they are raised puts them at a disadvantage in the measures that count in contemporary American society.<p>What would it take to overcome these disadvantages? Does poverty itself need to be eradicated, or can its effects on children somehow be counteracted? Can the culture of child-rearing be changed in poor neighborhoods, and if so, is that a project that government or community organizations have the ability, or the right, to take on? Is it enough simply to educate poor children in the same way that middle-class children are educated? And can any school, on its own, really provide an education to poor minority students that would allow them to achieve the same results as middle-class students?""<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/26/magazine/26tough.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/26/magazine/26tough.html</a><p>As for work ethic, how are you defining work?

I'm not referring to the obvious ones like which fork to use at a restaurant but rather to the more subtle ones like what constitutes appropriate small talk.  A 23 year-old from any socio-economic background might not have sufficient knowledge to contribute in a particular high-level meeting with a client.  However, the kid from the upper class background is more likely to have proven in subtle ways that he is unlikely to be an embarrassment.

While I agree that it does make a slightly different set of assumptions about the browser model, I don't think that application developers are employing it just because it is a "" cool new thing"".<p>In many cases, the hash-uri enables a new class of applications and system architectures that were not previously possible on the web.  Naked (hash less) uri's require that all state transitions round-trip to the server.  This isn't at all desirable if you want to support offline, or high latency (mobile) clients.<p>I am in agreement that we want to retain the link structure of the web.

Often its a bit more than just learning to program and building your site. Technical co founders are generally hard to find, because the good ones get taken quickly. Additionally many technical co-founders don't see the idea in the same way you do. I'd recommend doing all you can to first validate your idea before attempting to find that technical cofounder or learning to program yourself. Your #2, seems like a great starting point. From there I'd focus on both #1 and #4, #1 more to build out your concept and prove it than to fully build the product. While it might seem like extra work, it's worth it to work through issues and will make finding a technical cofounder easier.<p>As for actually finding a technical cofounder, go to various events. Since you're in the bay area there's no shortage of them from Hackers and Founders meetups, to Lean Coffee.

2297665,comment,2296550,2296550,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"When I used to interview a lot of college kids, I found that I could guess accurately within a few minutes of conversation which had lived in a dorm/frat house/whatever and which had lived at home while going to college.  The differences in social skills and worldliness/perspective were immense.  Was this due to the effects of being surrounded by a bunch of relatively ambitious young people or was it due to the socio-economic selection bias inherent in the decision to live at home while attending school?  Although I have read nothing to back up this claim, I presume that there is a positive correlation between high family income and the decision to go ""away"" for college.  Living with one's parents implies going to a local college/university vs. the one which is a tight fit with one's goals.  Also, it seems that those kids who live at home socialize with their local friends who, more often than not by virtue of still living in the town where they grew up, are less ambitious and worldly.  Causation is hard to tease out, but correlation is definitely present, at least based on my sampling from doing college interviewing in the Cleveland area (another cause of selection bias, of course).",1299516250

Dictators of 30 and 40 years are being cast off.<p>Unfortunately, revolutions are nothing new.  Bigger revolutions happened in the past quite impactfully without such technologies.  These technologies perhaps add benefit in the arms race to better organize against government's controls for infrastructure, institutions, and society.<p>>> I think that's a pretty skewed view of history. Another way to see it might be that we used to mostly have largely anarchistic/socialist societies that were overrun by a few greedy people and we've spent the rest of our history taking back our freedoms from the elite few of our day.\nNow you could say that even if we ever managed to get to a utopia state more greedy people will just show up but I would counter argue that e.g. Alexander the great wouldn't have gotten off the ground if people could have just sent a twitter to warn everyone else what he was up to.<p>The same technology that people use for freedom, powers that be can use for more nefarious purposes.  Technology in of itself is amoral and neutral.  It's rather about who uses it more effectively.  Today, the general populace perhaps has an advantage in that they're maybe more savvy than governments.  Not necessarily will be the case all the time though.  And besides that, it depends on whether people would love what Alexander stood for and would actually prefer to follow him.  Look at what happened in Germany.  Nobody better cite Godwin's Law here.  Mein Kampf is seriously a great example of how a single idea, communication, or piece of media can rally the people to a cause that people in hindsight realized was incorrect.

It took me a long time to learn proper social skills and I feel ten years behind my peers. This is typical in technology. I wont even go into how tech is this ghetto that rich kids never bother with anyway, they are just on the fast track to management.<p>On the other hand money is concrete and real.

The main upside is durability meaning the file is always readable and never left in an odd state. As noted, however, this has the downside of requiring compaction to reclaim disk space. You should note that if you are using bitcask, the default backend for riak, you will have the same problem that you had with couch as bitcask is also an aol (append only log) (aka. wol - write only log). Bitcask will also need compaction but as of the latest release there are various knobs to tweak regarding when that is queued up and when it is executed.<p>Re. database being one file:<p>I'm not exactly sure why couch uses one file but I suspect it is due to the use of b-trees internally. Would love to hear more from someone more experienced in couch. Riak splits its data amongst many files. Specifically one file (or 'cask' when using the default bitcask backend) per 'vnode' (virtual node, 64 by default). The drawback here is that you need to ensure that your environment has enough open file descriptors to service requests.",1299514783

This is because past Nintendo Wii updates <i>have</i> damaged modded systems, not because of any particular malicious intent on Nintendo's part, but because the mods changed the system in ways that Nintendo didn't expect. On the other hand, Nintendo could probably test that its updates work properly against the top few system modifications -- but it's hard to fault them for not doing so.",1299513928

Most of the job is figuring out how to deal with complexity in a way that is economical, maintainable, and satisfies secondary requirements like security and performance.<p>In any system design involving software, the software is where the complexity goes.  To save money, you might replace an electronic component with an algorithm.  To make a better product you might replace a tedious user action with an automated system.  This is because (some!) software developers/programmers have tools for dealing with complexity.  Things like abstraction and re-use that <i>don't</i> trivially map to the concrete world.<p>Frankly if software were about enumerating steps, I would have been out of this business long long ago.",1299513889

You are just asking them to buy a box (rent a virtual server) with more RAM because the equals operation just became memory intensive. A machine with 128GB of RAM will still give a near-constant result to ""does my test hash equal the user's password?""<p>""Just add more fake hashes"", you say. To get around the above, you have to use billions upon billions of fake hashes. The database abuse will eventually catch up to you.<p>This is trying to accomplish what bcrypt and scrypt do using tunable parameters, which is force the attacker to spend significantly more to break passwords than it costs you to test passwords (because they are doing it billions of times, you are doing it once).

4217010,comment,4216760,4216944,2,0,repsilat,,,"It's worse than the average strength would suggest, too. You can't do an arithmetic average and get a meaningful figure because cracking difficulty doubles with every bit.<p>Say passwords were distributed evenly at 35, 40.5 and 46 bits. You may have a lot of difficulty cracking the 46-bit passwords, but the 35-bit ones will be easy. Now, you can't tell which users have easy passwords, but it's easy enough to try the ""top 10,000 passwords"" (from previous dumps) on all of the hashes you get and see if any match.<p>Without the scheme outlined in TFA <i>many</i> users' passwords can be compromised this way. At 64ms each you can run those top 10,000 passwords on each user in less than 11 minutes, and you're almost guaranteed to get some hits. With this new technique, though, you <i>won't</i>, because you'll be lucky to even pick a ""real user"" in the first place.<p>EDIT: Of course, if your system is going to remain at all practical to use you can probably filter out the fake passwords with a simple join. You won't have user-data for all of your fake users, and you don't want the username space taken up by trillions of realistic-sounding dummy names preventing bona fide users from registering.",1341816975

I want to increase cost on as many axis as possible, in this case, by requiring you to steal 1TB of mostly meaningless data, and not just 100 odd bytes.<p>[Edit] sillysaurus - It's a great image, but a little hard to parse since it doesn't actually show you the bits of entropy for each choice.  If they did show a column for 40.5bits (average strength of a user's password) you would see the result is a lot closer to $150 for 'scrypt 64ms' than it is to the very sexy looking $4.8m.<p>Of course the technique could work even better with scrypt behind it (find/replace 20 bytes with 32 bytes).",1341815338

Sticking with your terms, the 900 and the 100 bought and sold out the show in 2 minutes. Now, 900 people who wanted to actually buy tickets and see the show have to go to the secondary market. 900 speculators crowded out 900 fans and now they are clearing prices that are anywhere from $10 to $100 above face. It is relevant to point out that the 900 have a number of methods for essentially cutting the line, so there are instances where the ""service"" involved some form of cheating the system. Is that good?<p>In fairness, the scenario you present is also not the norm. More often, 1,000 sophisticated buyers compete with 15,000 average Joe buyers for 10,000 tickets. The 1,000 buy the best 2,000 seats and the 15,000 fight it out for remaining 8,000 tickets, assuming there are no hold backs and that Ticketmaster's website works properly, which it often does not. At that point, some fraction of 11,000 desperate and dedicated fans turn to StubHub, eBay, etc. to find that that the $90 ticket is now $190. On the one hand, there was never enough supply to go around in the first place, on the other, 1,000 buyers were crowded out by speculators. The efficient market is really not so efficient with tickets for a complex series of reasons.<p>Finally, there are some sophisticated buyers who know that they can wait it out and buy tickets at or near face value close to show time. We are among those few, for now.",1341815327

I think some people are afraid to really be honest at the risk of being politically incorrect, and I appreciate the author's honesty.<p>I had the same reaction the OP did when I saw so many living side-by-side with the impoverished - especially children - and being so callused.  But the reality is that poverty is everywhere in India, and because it's a way of live, people simply adjust.<p>But it doesn't make it any less sad.  It's sad to see full-grown, gaunt men struggling to pedal their rickshaw in flip-flops over washboard roads for pennies.  But it's devastating seeing small children who are really, truly famished.<p>We would buy food for hungry children whenever we could, and often they would stare at us blankly at first.  They'd accept the food, but would have no reaction.  I figured they simply didn't appreciate it or couldn't muster a reaction.<p>But then I started watching them after we left.  And after they realized they weren't being had - and we really were giving them food with no strings attached - they were transformed.  I looked back at one begging child to see him absolutely gleeful, grinning from ear to ear.  Another child who I gave some candy and bit of money ran after our departing rickshaw - while holding his 1 year old sister - waving, smiling and dancing with joy.  It almost most made me cry.<p>But I didn't cry, not until the night before we left.  After three weeks in India, I was ready to to leave.  But at the same time, I felt almost guilty that I was able to return to such a country of prosperity and wealth while the children I'd taught would simply stay behind.  And while my wife and I had worked our ass off for 2 weeks to improve the school, the curriculum and the educational prospects for the kids, ultimately our effort wasn't going to move the needle, and few if any would ever leave the slums.  They had almost no shot at making a life for themselves.  With all these emotions stirring in my mind, my wife held me as I cried.<p>If you're living in the U.S. or any Western country, you are incredibly blessed / lucky.  Don't take it for granted.

They see the opportunity and the power.<p>But they also like to wax about the old times... and make no mistake, the old times was just a big boys club. Alcoholism was rampant, misogyny was par. A big story or scoop would take weeks if not months to develop and it might get buried on some fucked up principle (see Caro's excerpt in the New Yorker this year on LBJ's impending downfall until JFK and Dallas... a scoop, if not buried, alters the history of a million young American men and American foreign policy in profound ways), and then, once ready for the presses, after the editor trimmed it down, they'd all go celebrate their Pulitzer chances at a pub. It was a culture of exclusion and entitlement; your entree was ""J-School"" pedigree, or worse, your ability to kowtow to as a junior to an established writer until you got your chance, because that was your only path to being heard.<p>It was a time where accountability was proportional to distribution, which is to say, tightly controlled at all levels and, for better or for worse, self regulated. It was also a culture of self-congratulation. The only redeeming quality of the old school is that self-control over distribution gave them stupendous levels of access and leverage, something that doesn't seemingly exist anymore.",1341813634

Clearly there is very little incentive to buy a local newspaper when so much information is available for free from so many different suppliers online.<p>Anecdotally, I live in Melbourne and get a weekly local newspaper, but I don't pay for it since it comes with a bundle of advertising flyers.  We sometimes glance through the newspaper, but I wouldn't be willing to pay for it.  I'll wager that given the choice, most people would rather ditch the newspaper and keep the flyers.<p>FWIW the future of journalism will probably increasingly look like <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/</a>.

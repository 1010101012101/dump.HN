234606,story,,,1,0,brandnewlow,"Feedback Request: Executive Bored - Support group for people stuck at work",,"I just opened the doors on a site Monday and would love feedback.<p>http://www.executivebored.com<p>Background (read after you check out the site)<p>I'm a mid-20s city-dweller with lots of accountant/consultant/white collar friends.  They all share one thing - they hate their jobs. Also, the sites they used as procrastination fuel in college are definitely not work safe.  The old tricks don't work in the office.<p>A writer friend (he works in HR) and I wondered if we could make something that ""took care"" of them during the work day so they could laugh about the situation together and get on with work.  That's the audience and problem.<p>That was 12 days ago. Here's what we did since then to road test a solution:<p>1)  Decided to attack with an ""open magazine""-style site, a la JPGmag.com and College Humor.com. These sites are driven by a stable of contributors who ""seed"" the way for members to post their own stuff.<p>2)  Picked Drupal to build it on.  It's got the feature-set for a site like this.<p>3)  Grabbed a domain name - Executive Bored,.<p>4)  Thought up content with an eye toward making it easy to post stuff that seems natural in a work environment.  You can post stuff you bought at work, links to music you listen to at work, videos you watch at the office, games you play in the office and stories about work, all anonymously.<p>I added some basic social networking features, profile pages, friending, a few profile fields, ability to track your submissions.<p>5)  I worked away on it in my spare time for a few days.  Sunday night we e-mailed friends and family about it.  We started posting the next day. Response has been very positive.  We're just now telling people we don't know about it.<p>So that's Executive Bored.  Monday we had 70 people drop by.  Yesterday we had 200 people drop by. Today's looking like a 250-300 day and another 10 sign ups or so.<p>Thoughts?",1215035828

234601,comment,234550,234550,0,0,tstegart,,,"I don't place much value in web 2.0 marketing strategies. There is a difference between the user who would come to your site and stay and use it and the user who would just come in response to a campaign. You need to make sure your groundwork is done first before you start thinking about campaigns.<p>What value do you provide to users? Figure that out, then figure out what people would find that valuable. Then figure out where you can find a lot of those people, then think up marketing campaign ideas.<p>There is also a difference between marketing to your current users, and marketing to potential users. Separate the two. The contest idea for the top 5 commenters is really valuable to existing users. and it creates value (content) for you, which helps entice other users. But if you direct it at potential users, you're wasting your time, because they're not likely to join just to comment on something and hope to win something. Most people would assume an existing user would just beat them out for the prize, and they'd probably be right.<p>So my advice is to do a lot of groundwork first, then come up with an interesting idea that fits who you want to target. Not come with an interesting idea, and then try to fit it into what your research says.<p>And congratulations by the way, its a big step, so good luck. :)",1215035558

Don't get me wrong if you actually have something to do, its perfectly fine working for 100 hours. But don't try to force yourself into working a 100 hour week, just to convince yourself that you are taking it seriously.",1215034825

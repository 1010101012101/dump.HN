I mean a real certified banking system? Are they required to meet governmental guidelines of official banks?<p>What guarantee (if any) do I have that my money will be there in the morning? Is there some guarantee that if I go to login to bankSimple tomorrow morning and the domain doesn't resolve emails get bounced etc, would there be any recourse for me? [again, never bothered to ask that of my real bank but I suppose a brick and mortar institution instills more confidence]<p>Visa, MasterCard, Amex... Is the bankSimple card backed by any of these institutions? Can I walk into to some random QuickStop gas station and pay using your card like I could with my current bank card?<p>What kind of development and testing infrastructure do you guys utilize? Are you able to roll out updates to limited groups of real users so you can test changes on a small scale before rolling them out to every one? I'm more curious as to this aspect because I attribute to BankSimple more of a website or new software company [which I envision bugs and glitches that get worked out with feedback] rather than a traditional bank [which surprisingly even though I know is capable of making mistakes, I don't really worry about bugs]<p>Will BankSimple eventually if not at launch do other bank-y things like consumer loans, offer savings bonds, etc?<p>What about fraud protection? What if some one steals my card and buys a bunch of stuff with it? [Ok, I've asked my bank about this one at least]",1316631420

There are a lot of people out there who are unhappy with their banks. 
If they get enough users to sign up with them, the actual banks on the back end (which will probably be a collection of smaller, unknown, entitities), wield less and less power, cause in theory BS would be able to switch over from one bank to another and the user wouldn't know, or care.

The fact that Wallace and Darwin were pursuing very similar agendas at the same time speaks to this. We had the notion of evolution and atomism since the pre-socratics, just no plausible scientific evidence to give it public political traction and philosophical (in the sense of epistemological) credibility.<p>So I guess I end up agreeing with you -- it was a hard <i>public</i> sell before Darwin, but reductionism's advocates had been around for thousands of years. Also see F.A. Lange's _History of Materialism_. That also may be of interest to you. Lange was a Kantian who had tremendous influence on other atheist thinkers, especially Nietzsche.",1316631011

But it's absurd in the AB testing context to advocate not acting on your data. Of course it's also absurd to look at conventional p-values if you do.  So it's a bit of a Catch-22.<p>All this confusion goes away if you realize you are interested in p(lift | data) rather than p( data | lift=0). The sampling distribution -- the distribution of the statistic under repeated sampling, p(data | lift=0) -- does not play a role in Bayesian statistics.  Obviously the ""model"" (likelihood/prior) does, but this doesn't include the experimental procedure provided that the experiment is only based on observed data.<p>AB testing, as a decision procedure, is an area where I don't think the standard frequentist - Bayesian debate applies.  The Bayesian decision rule is the <i>only</i> profit maximizing solution.  That said, I""m sympathetic to being practical.

I also dedicated a chapter to the issue of producing content on a regular basis.<p>Your question is covered amply within the book, but the gist of it is that you need to take the following steps.<p>Step 1: Have the right mindset. Blogging is not optional for your business. Inbound marketing is an extremely cost effective tool to help you promote your business. To ignore it is to to leave money on the table - and potentially a lot of it at that. Blogging, for your startup, is a marketing activity.<p>Step 2: Schedule it. Do you code just when you want? Do you answer support emails whenever the mood strikes? No. So if blogging is a serious component of your business, you need to schedule time for it. OK, you're busy, we all are, but can you spare one or two hours a week? Set that time in your calendar. That allocation is sufficient to publish at least one post per week.<p>Step 3: Write it. You just had a pop up appear from your online calendar that says ""Write a post titled 'How Coach to 5K changed my life'"". Good. Now sit down and start writing for an hour in order to complete the post. The more frequently you do it, the faster you'll become. The book suggests several techniques for focusing (including the Pomodoro Technique), and includes a large list of suggestions for dealing with writer's block.<p>Step 4: Promote it. Use an hour, usually much less, which you booked ahead of time, to promote your article. I dedicated Part 3 of the book to this topic. Just follow the steps, it's all written down and ready for you to avail of.<p>Other parts of the book will guide you in terms of strategic decisions, and the chapter 11 (which is in progress at the moment) is going to be solely dedicated to aiding startups in promoting their own products.<p>Your concern is valid for sure, but I believe my book will squash it out and put your mind at ease well before you finish reading it.",1316628307

It will always hurt, and it never goes away, but you do come to be at peace with it over time.<p>I am really thinking about you and this wonderful tribute you've written for your lovely mother right now.  You've done something beautiful and she is so proud of you.<p>My advice at this time is to fully allow yourself to mourn.  It's OK. Only you can experience your mourning and it may be the same or it may be different from how other people experience it, but just remember that only you can experience your mourning in the way you need to.<p>And that is totally cool because you are a beautiful piece of your Mom that is here right now.<p>Plus... Betty would've wanted it that way.<p>My sorrows are with you / Marc",1316628274

Why?",,"As an accounting student, I've always been confused why there are rarely accounting/finance roles at startups. Is it that there simply isn't a 'need' that early in the game? Do the founders typically take care of it? Is it better to be outsourced initially/taken care of by investor-mentors? Something I'm entirely missing?<p>I'll be doing my time at a Big 4 starting in spring, but I've been intrigued with ycombinator and firms like Sequoia since high school, often trawling their job pages to see what kind of knowledge/experience would be required for someone with my interests (financial reporting, business intelligence, etc.) -- what to ""do"" for startups or small businesses is never to very rarely discussed in the top accounting education programs. It's almost always large corporate or Big 4/mid-size public accounting employer that are pounded into us, regardless of future interests after those experiences.<p>So, I guess... thoughts?",1316628082

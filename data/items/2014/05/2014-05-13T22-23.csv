That would still put it squarely into the rewrite-break phase of the cycle, so it&#x27;s too soon to tell whether the &quot;leave&quot; phase will follow or not.<p>> Getting a commit bit to the most important bit, Rakudo, requires evidence of competence<p>The few Perl 6 contributors I know were highly competent.

Its not totally clear that the url that you are supposed to use is the url that is generated when you create a new app and land inside of Forge.<p>2.  Its also not <i>totally</i> clear that in retrieving data you&#x27;re supposed to follow the structure of you JSON schema.

7741112,comment,7735141,7737157,3,0,dgreensp,,,"There&#x27;s actually an interesting deeper connection between OT and CRDT, in which OT comes across as a special case of CRDT.<p>Suppose your state is a text document or array of characters (we could also examine other kinds of state like an unordered set of objects with properties, but it&#x27;s less interesting).  CRDT assigns a semi-permanent name to each unique data element (character), which is typically a string that indexes into a tree.  It&#x27;s permanent unless the names get too long, in which case you rebalance the tree.  The papers I&#x27;ve read treat the rebalancing as an offline operation, to be done one day at 3am when no one is using the system, but in principle you could do it online, as long as you save enough information to rewrite the names in any operations you receive that were meant for the old tree to apply to the new tree.  OT is equivalent to rebalancing the tree after every operation.  You don&#x27;t actually need a tree, then, and the names are just numbers (in the case of an array).  Names are scoped to a revision, and operations are always rewritten to use the appropriate names before applying them.<p>Another maintenance operation you might do on a CRDT tree is to remove &quot;garbage&quot; (deleted elements, which you keep around so that you can perform insertion operations relative to them).  OT always delete garbage immediately, and operations that refer to a deleted element are rewritten (when they are transformed against the operation that deleted the element).<p>I&#x27;m not saying one is better than the other.  People seem to have an easier time wrapping their heads around CRDT, but maybe just because OT hasn&#x27;t been explained well.  The CRDT tree and name strings sounds like kind of a pain to implement versus OT&#x27;s arrays, but I&#x27;ve only implemented OT and not CRDT.<p>Saying that APIs are a &quot;mechanism of state transfer&quot; is as overbroad as saying function calls are a mechanism of state transfer.  The article at first seems to provide itself an out, by saying that only a certain class of APIs is being considered, but then it defines API as a &quot;set of names.&quot;  Similarly, you say that any application touching more than one computer is a distributed system, and then you preemptively defend against exceptions by saying, &quot;If this doesn&#x27;t apply to you, maybe you don&#x27;t have a distributed system.&quot;<p>More concretely, APIs do a lot of stuff.  They send and receive text messages and emails; they transcode video; they turn on your coffee maker; they post to your Facebook wall.  Often there is little or no shared representation, except perhaps the status of the operation, which can typically be communicated in a simple way.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think more APIs could work by synchronizing state.  Basically, use something equivalent to a git repo under the hood.  Gmail could work this way.  Maybe mail servers could even work this way.<p>Posting to a Facebook wall doesn&#x27;t work this way.  The way to make posting to a Facebook wall use CRDT would be to replace API calls like addPost and deletePost (say) with a single API call &quot;updateWall&quot; which performs arbitrary operations on a user&#x27;s wall.  Thanks to CRDT, this operation never fails (though the client may still want to know when it has completed).  In casual conversation at Meteor, we call it the &quot;Lotus Notes&quot; model when all operations go through the data layer, which synchronizes over the network.  Asana&#x27;s internal framework also uses this model, so a couple Meteor devs who worked at Asana have experience with it.  The main drawback is that it is difficult to perform validation and security checks.  If the Facebook API only has &quot;updateWall,&quot; Facebook must determine whether the diff it receives constitutes a valid operation or series of operations for user A to perform on user B&#x27;s wall (for example, you can add any number of posts to anyone&#x27;s wall, but only delete posts off your own).  This is much more complicated than having addPost and deletePost, each with the appropriate security checks, and knowing that no other operations are permitted.<p>To abolish The API completely like you say, you&#x27;d have to not just have updateWall but basically one, unnamed API call for all of Facebook, and then you could say there&#x27;s no API.",1400021317

Far from representing a break with history, this tradition--wherein reputations are sticky and inescapable--is consistent with how human societies lived for thousands of years. Until relatively recently (~100 years ago), the vast majority of people lived in the same town for their entire lives, and there was a collective remembrance of their character.  Everybody knew everybody&#x27;s business, and preserved it through gossip. At least partly out of necessity, our cultures evolved significant traditions of society-wide shaming; stealing an apple could be punished by public shaming in the stocks in the town square. Social acceptance and even livelihood was based on your character, and the punishment for even minor moral failures was severe.<p>I submit that reputations were only escapable in a meaningful way for maybe the past 75-100 years, when our cultures (at least, industrialized cultures) became increasingly mobile: people left home to pursue education on the other side of the country, to begin careers and new lives in new cities without a trace of their old lives and reputations. This ability to escape your past and reinvent yourself was a brief aberration. The size of our communities exploded in the last 15 years as the internet expanded, and it seems not that different from when we lived in teeny communities and everyone knew our business.<p>There isn&#x27;t and never has been a statute of limitations for dumb and embarrassing things. Whether to create one now is a normative question, and regardless of how you come down on that, I just don&#x27;t think you can justify robust privacy protections--particularly at the expense of transparency--based on supposed historical respect for privacy.",1400021219

A very specific and specialized form of dog disappeared almost overnight once the artificial selection maintaining it was removed. It&#x27;s a testament to the ability of genes to repair themselves given the least bit of diversity to work with.<p>That&#x27;s a pretty weird way to look at it. &#x27;Repair&#x27;? No one is shining x-rays at turnspit dogs. What happened is that the selection pressures changed, and as quickly as they adapted to the turnspit niche, they adapted to the alternative niches like being mutts or lapdogs. Selection is fast, artificial or &#x27;natural&#x27;.<p>Which incidentally suggests that we&#x27;re wasting a lot of potential.

I reasoned that presentations are critical for marketing, sales, and entrepreneurship in general, and that the students had very limited presentation experience so the format would give them experience. Then I followed many presentations with students meeting one-on-one to give advice to each other.<p>Public presentations with feedback are accountability tools that force them to do thorough, quality work, to pay attention to each other, to see how others tackle similar challenges, and to develop communication skills. Several of them were scared to present at first but then reported improving presentation skills as one of the most important parts of the class. They grew a lot in that area.<p>I also made deliverables similar to real-world problems. I assigned them to talk to people in the field, even experts in the field, which forced them to prepare (I didn&#x27;t just throw them to the wolves. We worked up to that by having them practice with classmates and then friends and family to develop their business communication skills).<p>Regarding breadth, I told them at the beginning of class something like this: &quot;Even the best salespeople learn sales their whole lives. Nothing anyone can do can make you the worlds&#x27; best salesperson or marketer in one semester. You&#x27;ll always have more to learn. If you became the best, you&#x27;d probably keep learning faster. My goal in this class is to develop in you the skill to improve yourself by finding out what you need to know and learning it -- to improve the slope of your learning more than the y-intercept.&quot;<p>The most important tool was having them act, not just listen or read. I can&#x27;t comment on how things will go for them in the future, but they&#x27;ve already hit major business challenges and learned how to overcome them, like how to find an expert in the field and get him on the phone. Each saw others do it. Their barriers are lower. If they have depth without breadth and they need it, I hope they&#x27;ll figure out how to get that breadth. The class is only a semester so we couldn&#x27;t cover everything no matter what.<p>By the way, they weren&#x27;t purely self-directed learners. I created the course structure and they never worked more than a week without oversight.<p>Incidentally, I don&#x27;t claim to have mastered inquiry-driven project-based learning, only that it&#x27;s gone great so far. I expect to keep learning my skills in it forever. Part of why I&#x27;m posting at such length here is to try to find or create community of people who work similarly.

There is a very important difference between a self-taught student and one that has undergone through formal education, and that is scientific rigor. Not to say that a self-learned person is less knowledgeable or &quot;worse&quot;, it&#x27;s obviously not true and there are always extremes, however actually attending lectures, going through the daily (and sometimes boring) routine of grinding through contents as explained in a boring way by your lecturer.. it&#x27;s all part of building your determination and character as a researcher.<p>More often than not I find self-taught people staying at a very shallow level of knowledge, broad and generic, never digging through the details, going that extra mile to properly master a subject in a structured and well-disciplined matter.<p>In my opinion, that kind of education can only be achieved in a mentor-student relationship and, especially, through formal lectures.

Besides the name of the degree, I can&#x27;t think of anything that was particular top-notch about my education here. Class sizes were big and are only getting bigger. The intro CS class had a few hundred when I took it. Now? It can have up to 1100 students. I would say I&#x27;ve only had 4 good or great professors (enthusiastic, interesting, smart but also good at teaching) my whole time here - one in CS, one in EE, the other two in humanities. Everyone else ranged from useless or unbearable to okay. Many were simply too smart, so to speak. In other classes, the lecture powerpoints did most of the work for them.<p>In fact, most of my learning took place while taking notes independently on lecture notes / slides (rarely the textbook, although sometimes they were okay), sometimes watching lectures from other schools, and then trying to apply the knowledge to projects and practicing for exams. Discussion sections were only occasionally useful, generally for the more difficult classes where I actually needed an empathetic person who recently took the course to explain things to I.<p>For the most part, though, I feel like I taught myself most of what I learned here - I would have done fine if lectures didn&#x27;t exist. Mind you, this only applies to the CS program. I took only the required EE courses.<p>The great thing about the institution is definitely the research. My graphics professor, for example, does a ton of awesome work both academically and professionally. Working with him would have been a great opportunity to get into that industry.<p>Otherwise, I don&#x27;t see why I couldn&#x27;t have just done my education by myself. The only problem would be motivation to slug through the difficult / boring but important stuff. My databases class got quite boring at points such that, if I were teaching myself, I may have just skipped over a good chunk of the class material.

Greece counts between several dozen to hundreds of religions. 500 year later, 3 big religions left. Roman republic + empire, starts out with hundreds of religions. When it ended ... 2. 200 years after it ended, only one religion really survived it. Or you could take Africans in America. At one point African genes were pretty much the only genes of 18% of the population of the United States. Currently, about 2% of Americans have majority African genes, a number that&#x27;s dropping exponentially (but obviously only once per generation).<p>But as I said Google &quot;island species&quot; and read around a bit. It is part of the original theory of evolution, described by Charles Darwin, and pretty much the only part that has survived almost unchanged.<p>Essentially, diversity can exist where large natural barriers separate different groups, so that when individuals copy eachother, they copy, imperfectly, one of their own group. Because small errors make the groups drift apart, diversity occurs. The result is that an ethnic barrier gets created along the natural barrier. When the barrier goes away, because of technology, climate change, military conquest, or a natural disaster, so does the ethnic and/or ideological difference. It does not go away by merging both races or ideologies, it goes away because one of them dies out, to be replaced by the other.<p>Needless to say, modern technology has been tearing down most of those barriers. If the result is diversity, that will be the first time in history, but it is plainly obvious that there is nothing all that different between the current time period and previous time periods where for some reason populations mixed. The result will be the same : only one culture survives.",1400019627

Plus, TLB misses can be avoided in our loop, especially with such a friendly linear sweep.<p>The main problem here, in my view: trying to coax the OS into using memory the way we want. Huge pages surely help in that regard, but they help the most in code that we do not control. The sum itself over 1 GB of memory would be roughly the same speed, regardless of page size.<p>To put this to the test: generate 1 GB of random bytes on the fly, instead of reading them from a file, and do the same sum.

7740938,comment,7740339,7740339,5,0,languagehacker,,,"Another good dimensionality reduction technique to consider is Latent Dirichlet Allocation. I use this approach for natural language or other &quot;bursty&quot; data sets. &quot;Bursty&quot; data sets are characterized by having Zipfian distribution over features, but certain long-tail features achieving a higher probability of multiple observations given initial observation in an instance. For example, &quot;armadillo&quot; is relatively rare, but an article mentioning an armadillo once has a high chance of mentioning it again.<p>A cool thing about LDA is that it allows you to express the latent characteristics of a given document as a point in Euclidean space. This gives you the ability to use spatial distance metrics such as cosine distance to express document similarity. I specifically use this for recommending large-scale UGC communities based on their latent characteristics. Furthermore, since you&#x27;ve turned your language data into spatial data, you&#x27;re able to use spatial classifiers such as SVMs more effectively over natural language data, which is normally a bit better suited for Bayesian classifiers.<p>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Gensim for its LDA library. It&#x27;s even capable of distributed computing using Pyro4. It&#x27;s relatively trivial to deploy an LDA pipeline for extremely large datasets using EC2 and the Boto AWS library.<p>Edit: If you haven&#x27;t heard of it, scikit-learn is an awesome Python library for highly performant machine learning using Python&#x27;s C extensions for numerical computing (scipy, numpy).

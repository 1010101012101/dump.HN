900927,comment,898675,900028,0,0,shachaf,,,"I like to think that people vote on a comment based on the content, not on the (current) score. It is not particularly unlikely that twenty-four people thought:<p><i>This is a worthwhile comment! It points out something that I did not realize, and change the meaning of the article to a degree. I may as well vote on it, that it may move upward in the list and other people read it earlier than other comments.</i><p>Also remember that +1 isn't specified to be ""Insightful"" or ""Informative"" like Slashdot; nor can you vote a ""half-good"" comment up a half-point. Instead, to achieve the same effect, a half-good comment must appeal to half as many people. This comment happened to appeal, on its own merits, to twenty-four people.<p>(Does this mean that the highest-voted comments might be the ones that appeal to the biggest percentage of the site, rather than the ones of the highest quality? Hmm. Does that mean that for the voting system to work well, a good percentage of users must specifically only vote comments that are very good?)",1256417397
900926,comment,900542,900622,0,0,soundsop,,,"It used to be the case that DRAM was more sensitive to soft errors than SRAM until about 8 to 10 years ago. Today, soft errors in SRAM are more of a problem than in DRAM. The capacitance per unit cell of DRAM has remained relatively constant, while the capacitance per node of SRAM has shrunk dramatically with transistor scaling. So even though SRAM actively holds data, contrasted to DRAM, which passively hold data, SRAM's low capacitance makes it more susceptible to soft errors.",1256417337

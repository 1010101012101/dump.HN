5395902,comment,5395339,5395339,1,0,japhyr,,,"I teach high school math and science to at-risk students, and I teach an intro to programming class when I can.  I have heard numerous stories of smart kids who realized in middle school that they wanted to be programmers.  It often falls along the lines of ""I noticed that all of my peers liked playing games, but I was more interested in how you make games.""<p>These students often spend years chasing different leads about how to follow up on their interest.  All of the software tools needed to dive into programming are free, but the ecosystem is really hard to navigate if you don't know anyone who is aware of current professional programming practices.  Many ""computer science"" teachers do harm to these students by directing them to dead-end languages on old school-district-based Windows systems.  I don't use the term ""do harm"" lightly, either.  I have seen numerous examples of young people who have built up serious resentment towards education in general because of their frustration in dealing with teachers who know less than they do.<p>/rant<p>Here's what I'd suggest:\n- Look for the students with a spark in their eye.  See if you can pick out which ones already know they want to be good hackers.\n- Map out their next few years of learning, so they know what to focus on.\n- Tell them to learn Linux.  Tell them that if they can find a beater laptop, download a distro, and load it, they can have functioning computers their whole lives.  Low-income students have a difficult time maintaining Windows computers at home.  If they can build a linux box, they can take charge of hardware issues.\n- Tell them to learn python.  The community is incredibly supportive of non-traditional programmers, and the language leads you to whatever kind of actual work you want to do in programming.\n- Last, and most important: if you can do a followup visit two weeks or one month from now, your impact will be deepened.  Ask the students which of them have tried to follow up on your talk.  Those are the students who need your support.  Just act as a guide for them; help them find a beater laptop, help them get a distro running, help them run an interactive shell, point them to some learning resources.\n- If you really want to make a difference, keep visiting every 2-4 weeks so these students spend minimal time lost in the programming ecosystem.<p>In closing, thank you for doing this.  There are incredibly smart kids in low-income areas, and many of them have a strength in them from dealing with adversity.  If we support them, they can channel that strength towards very meaningful work.",1363629325

People are then free to gauge whether or not the asking price is too high, and opt not to buy. Ultimately, the choice of distribution channel becomes determined by both parties, the buyers and sellers, by agreeing on a price.<p>On the other hand, if the consumers collectively decide to subvert this process and set the price at zero, where does that leave the author? Their message is ""I'm going to take your work and pay you nothing for it. Get back to us when you can offer us a better deal than something for nothing.""<p>Which option seems like a better system to you? Technology has made taking content and paying nothing for it a frictionless transaction. Many people here seem to believe that since technology has enabled it, or made it so easy, or made it so difficult to regulate, it therefore must be a natural right that we've had all along, but can only now fully enjoy due to the miracles of modern technology.<p>If some group on the supply side gains a monopoly, the government in theory steps in and regulates to protect the consumer from price gouging. This notion appeals to us, that when one party in the holds all the cards, they shouldn't use exploit that power to price gouge. Yet when the consumers suddenly hold all the cards, we turn a blind eye to imbalance in power.<p>I'm not saying that movie studios and record labels should be protected so that they can cling to old distribution methods.

5395718,comment,5391077,5393131,1,0,onedev,,,"Ok so I'd like to start off by saying thank you for expanding your views. I enjoy debating with people who are willing to provide reasoning for their views. I didn't really like your original comment, but your response was much better.<p>>That was hardly true until Apple started requesting product-bans world wide. They broke the truce. They started the avalaunch. They get the bad karma. That's how it works.<p>I'd like to argue that those types of lawsuits weren't widely <i>publicized</i> until Apple's whole situation since everything Apple does is high-profile. I think to an extent they were right in wanting to ban blantantly similar looking devices, as they take their original designs very seriously, design is at the core of Apple. Samsung has a history of blatantly ripping off Apple design, and as such deserved the outcome of the lawsuits. You might accuse me of being an Apple fanboy, but the one thing that tipped me in Apple's favor is this Samsung cable connector: (<a href=""http://johncblandii.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/samsung30pin.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://johncblandii.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/samsung30...</a>). Now be honest, does it not piss you off that a company would be so committed to copying another company's design to the extent that they would rip of a completely proprietary connector that Apple have been using for 10 years (since the OG iPod)?<p>>Trying to hijack the entire future of mobile computing by exploiting bad laws and preventing everyone else from entering market still makes you an asshole, a wanne-be monopolist and generally shows off your true identity.<p>I think <i>hijack</i> is a strong word that should be reserved for Microsoft and IE6. I agree that they were very aggressive and certainly not very ""open"" as a company, and maybe you don't like that, which I can completely understand. But this is the way Apple has <i>always been</i>. They were never about being <i>open</i>. They had their entire proprietary stack of hardware and software and that's what makes Apple..Apple and consumers seem to love that ecosystem, as well as developers. Not defending them at all here, but just saying that they never claimed to be a company committed to ""openness"". Also, to be fair, the iPhone and iPad completely revolutionized the future of mobile computing. Android is certainly pushing the boundaries today, I agree (Google is a software powerhouse), but you may forget that back in 2007, the iPhone was an absolute revolution and magical in every sense of the word. The iPad wasn't nearly as magical when it came out, but it's widespread adoption set the tone for the tablet market as we know it today. I don't think you'll disagree with me here. Does this give them the excuse to be so aggressive? Maybe not, but that's the way they've been, and you should give credit where credit is due, regardless.<p>>You want everyone locked in to your solutions with no way out. In fact you dont want there to be any other ways at all.\nWhich by no means is illegal. It just means that you are showing off values which are completely orthogonal to everything I believe in: freedom.You believe in zero freedom. You want to take mine away. I am free to hate you for that. Deal.<p>I don't know how Apple is taking away your freedoms. Can you explain a little more on how you think they're contributing to that? You're free not to buy into Apple's proprietary stack, just like you're free not to buy into Facebook's proprietary stack, or Google's increasingly proprietary stack (killing off Reader and CalDAV was for a reason), or Microsoft's proprietary technologies. Apple is kinda <i>known</i> for being extremely proprietary but lets not forget the other elephants in the room either. How do you think these companies are taking away your freedoms? What freedoms did you have before that you miss now because of what Apple did?<p>>Yes. They are using their rounded corners and want everyone else in the mobile industry to create devices made out of spikes. Cry me a river. Design and trivial UI implementation details should not be patentable. Apple has bad karma for exploiting these laws.<p>I really hate the ""rounded corners"" argument. I know the patent may say ""rounded corners"" but if you read deeper into such patents you being to realize that its a much more specific patent than the phrases suggest. Patents are usually given to a very specific implementation. You can't judge a patent based on it's name or one little excerpt that you read. Now, we both agree that patents needs reform. How that reform plays out and how it will deal with such patents remains to be seen.<p>Let's ASSUME that Apple did have a patent for just ""rounded corners"" and it really was as straightforward as that. Why the hell was Apple awarded a patent for rounded corners? Who the hell was in charge of giving Apple that patent? That's the real issue. If I was a company and I had tons of money laying around, I would for-sure try to enforce any patents I had (again, remember I'd be a business). The problem would be giving me patents like ""rounded corners"" which gives me more ammunition against my competitors. But remember, this is all assuming that ""rounded corners"" is really as simple as the phrase suggests, which I can assure you isn't. However this doesn't mean there is an excuse for Apple being allowed to hold such a patent either.<p>>Not agreed. I can hate both the player and the game. Gues what? I do. In Apple's case they have shown that they are willing to take the game anywhere their products are facing competition.<p>This is your opinion and I gladly respect it. I don't think you're wrong for holding this opinion as its completely valid. I can understand your hatred of companies that are aggressive and use such tactics.<p>My point was that many many companies use such tactics and you shouldn't single out Apple just because the media loves to single them out for page-hits. You should take a look at the lawsuits Amazon have started for their one-click patent (which I'm sure we can both agree sounds just as frivolous as ""rounded corners""), or any of the other numerous patents. We can take the argument one step further and criticize Twitter and Facebook for heavily regulating their API (which we can draw parallels with patents since both are proprietary), but at the end of the day I still like the technology that they build and I can respect their business decisions even though I may not agree with them. Twitter needs to make money, as does Facebook and they're trying to stop the commoditization of their data in exchange for perhaps a less free and open API. Does this mean they're hijacking the future? I wouldn't say so, but you might feel different and like I said, I can respect that.",1363627924

Instead it would be:<p><pre><code>    if (value == 0) {\n        return result0;\n    }\n    if (value == 1) {\n        return result1;\n    }\n    if (value == 2) {\n        return result2;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nor:<p><pre><code>    if (value == 0) return result0;\n    if (value == 1) return result1;\n    if (value == 2) return result2;\n</code></pre>\nThen on this page:<p><a href=""https://github.com/shichuan/javascript-patterns/blob/master/general-patterns/for-loops.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/shichuan/javascript-patterns/blob/master/...</a><p>there is this code:<p><pre><code>    // optimization 1 - cache the length of the array with the use of `max`\n    for (var i = 0, max = myarray.length; i < max; i++) {\n        // do something with myarray[i]\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe code is OK, but 'max' is a very poor name. It sounds too much like Math.max, and it isn't the <i>maximum</i> value for the loop. It's one greater than that.<p>If you want to cache the array length like this, then any of these names would be far better than max: either 'length' to match the 'array.length', or 'len' for something shorter, or 'n' if you want it really short. These names all better reflect the meaning of this variable: the length of the array. ('n' stands for 'number', as in the number of elements in the array.)<p>Later on the page it recommends:<p><pre><code>    // preferred 1\n    var i, myarray = [];\n    for (i = myarray.length; i--;) {\n        // do something with myarray[i]\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI'm not a fan of running loops backwards for optimization except where it's really necessary. When I'm reading the code I rarely know whether the backwards loop is simply an optimization, or essential to the algorithm. It adds mystery to the code, and I don't like that.<p>Of course a comment could be added saying ""Backwards loop is for optimization only"" or ""Backwards loop is needed for the algorithm"", but I've never seen a backwards loop aficionado do this.<p>A few years ago I worked with someone who hated jQuery and libraries in general and preferred to write his own bare metal DOM loops for everything. And he wrote them all backwards. Later on he warmed up a bit to the idea of using jQuery, after seeing a 20-line bare metal function be reduced to a simple and straightforward selector, but when we started going through the code it was never clear if we needed to add a "":last"" to the selector to make it match the backwards loop or not.<p>It's pretty rare that this kind of loop optimization will make much difference, unless the work done in the loop body is truly minimal.<p>Then on this page:<p><a href=""https://github.com/shichuan/javascript-patterns/blob/master/general-patterns/for-in-loops.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/shichuan/javascript-patterns/blob/master/...</a><p>it has this code:<p><pre><code>    // somewhere else in the code\n    // a method was added to all objects\n    if (typeof Object.prototype.clone === 'undefined') {\n        Object.prototype.clone = function () {\n        };\n    }\n</code></pre>\nNow this is part of a discussion about why you should use 'hasOwnProperty()' in a for-in loop to avoid enumerating Object.prototype additions, but there should also be a mention that you should not extend Object.prototype at all, ever, unless you are 100% certain that all the code in your page or project is under your own control and carefully uses hasOwnProperty().<p>For example, the Google Maps API has for-in loops that do not use hasOwnProperty(). If you extend Object.prototype, then no matter how careful you are in the rest of your own code, you'll have some confusing problems if you later want to add a Google map to your page.<p>(At least the Maps API used to work this way - it's possible that they have started using hasOwnProperty() now - I haven't checked it in a while. But the same problem could occur with any third-party code you may want to use.)<p>OK, well, on this page:<p><a href=""https://github.com/shichuan/javascript-patterns/blob/master/general-patterns/built-in-prototypes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/shichuan/javascript-patterns/blob/master/...</a><p>it does mention that you shouldn't extend Object.prototype, but there's no hint as to why you shouldn't.<p>On this page:<p><a href=""https://github.com/shichuan/javascript-patterns/blob/master/general-patterns/switch-pattern.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/shichuan/javascript-patterns/blob/master/...</a><p><pre><code>    switch (inspect_me) {\n        case 0:\n            result = ""zero"";\n            break;\n        case 1:\n            result = ""one"";\n            break;\n        default:\n            result = ""unknown"";\n    }\n</code></pre>\nOmitting the break; on the last case in a switch statement is a bad idea.

5395496,comment,5393553,5393553,1,0,callinyouin,,,"As someone with essentially no experience with Smalltalk, let me offer some criticism. (It's constructive criticism, I promise :)<p>I'm a CS student taking a programming languages course, and for our term project we need to learn a new programming language, write a small project in the language and write a paper on its implementation, features, strengths, weaknesses, etc. After reading about an awful lot of languages, I thought Smalltalk would be an interesting choice, at least on the implementation side, given its relatively unique image-based system, not to mention having a graphical component, essentially an IDE, at the core of the environment.<p>Since Pharo seemed like the most popular choice, I decided to give it a shot. I was excited to get started, so I figured I could download the ""one-click"" for version 1.4 and get started right away. After extracting the zip and being given a .app folder, I thought I had mistakenly downloaded the Mac version. Nope, the website clearly says ""For OS X, Linux, and Windows"". Right off the bat this shows that Mac is probably the ""first-class citizen"", and it definitely doesn't show that the developers know how to properly distribute their software for multiple platforms (whether or not it's true, that's what it looks like). Since my platform of choice is Linux, and having seen the half-hearted attempts at supporting Linux from so many vendors so many times in the past, I started to get a bad feeling.<p>I found the README, whose only information is to run the .sh file included. I ran it and was given the helpful message that the ""Contents/Linux/pharo"" file was missing. Finding that hard to believe, I navigated to where that file was supposed to be located and, sure enough, there it was. After doing some detective work, I found the reason for my missing file message was due to the pharo binary being built for 32-bit systems. NOWHERE on Pharo's home page or download page is this apparent. No warning is given to the new, unsuspecting, 64-bit-OS-having user.<p>If anyone involved with the Pharo project is reading this, please understand that this is unacceptable. In 2013, if some software is built for 32-bit OS's only, the user should not only be warned before they decide to download the software, but something less cryptic than a misleading ""file not found"" error when trying to run the software would be helpful. I guess I can't say for sure, but to me this looks like almost no effort was put into helping new users get started.<p>Still somewhat determined to get this thing running, I installed an incredible amount of 32-bit libraries. Still no luck. I got to the point where a ""could not find module vm-display-X11"" is displayed. The file does exist, it's just another case of the 32-bit library blues. I installed some additional X11 32-bit compatibility libraries, but still had no luck.<p>Unable to justify wasting more time getting this thing working, I just gave up. I really wanted to spend some time with Pharo, but I guess the developers don't care about newcomers who don't already know the in's and out's of the system. I'm sorry, but if you want any sort of Smalltalk comeback that I've been reading so much about, this is absolutely NOT the way to do it.",1363626317

It takes less than a minute to transfer your Google reader content over to the two dozen or so, very capable, replacements that are more than eager to take you on. If Google note decides to shut down in a decade, be assured that your content will be with you no matter where you decide to go next. There will certainly be many more, perhaps even more innovative and capable replacements at the time.<p>While it's nice to not have to migrate your content every decade or so (Google Reader was introduced 8 years ago), it's certainly not that painful. As apps and services evolve at blistering pace, I love the fact that we can get some fresh air, and a wave of new innovations.

On a bigger monitor the website is essentially unreadable. A 29px font for the body copy is a bit outrageous.<p>I like the idea, but I don&#x27;t think fully automatic font scaling is the way to go. Mapping resolution to font size (which is essentially what the Javascript magic does) doesn&#x27;t work because resolution doesn&#x27;t mean much anymore. An HD tablet and a 27&quot; monitor have the same resolution but demand completely different text sizes because you sit so much farther away from a desktop monitor.<p>So for the time being I think the best way to go is to create a mostly fluid layout and to write custom CSS for manual adjustments to make sure it looks good on smartphones, tablets, laptops and desktop monitors.",1377093255

Which probably doesn&#x27;t even cover his bar tab, but whatever.<p>The other problem with the low rated occupations is the author doesn&#x27;t want to work outdoors, therefore surely no one wants to, but part of the reason pay is so low to work outdoors is because so many people want to work outdoors (despite supposedly no one wants to do it).  So that&#x27;s how you end up with biology grads as foresters at $20K/yr (oh wait the article claims bio is 4th best job, now I&#x27;m confused)<p>The final distortion is several of the high ranking jobs are &quot;winner takes all&quot; much like professional sports.

The data or physical quantities of a computer and our Universe can change only by discrete amounts like the bits of a computer. Time, space, and energy are quantized in our universe.<p>* The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle also implies Interactions don&#x27;t &#x27;count&#x27; unless they affect some other piece of the system. Is the Universe doing called &#x27;lazy evaluation&#x27; here?<p>* Quantum entanglement is like dereferencing a pointer to our universe&#x27;s data (quanta). Einstein called this spooky action at a distance. Physics today are using this principle to instantly teleport data on photons located hundreds of miles away.<p>* In computer simulations, the von Neumann stabilitiy criterion states that no effect can propagate at a speed faster than the size step divided by the time step. Interactions in our universe are also limited by the speed of light.<p>* E=mc2 : mass and energy are two forms of the same thing. Data and the instructions that operate on it are both stored in memory.<p>* Holographic Principle does away with spatial locality, drastically reducing the number of possible states our Universe can have.

Coupled with the fact that almost every mundane action or movement is now tied to communications (often involuntary) via our phones or other devices, that makes it very hard to escape surveillance. That ambition of a full take has always been there, but only now is it becoming possible, and instead of restraining the security services, it appears our politicians are encouraging them. I&#x27;m not sure that they, or we, even understand the implications yet, or what will happen when this data leaks or is misused on a large scale.<p>Even just the analysis of public internet data (like twitter feeds) will at some point in the future have profound effects, let alone the private data our security services are collecting. Retrospective and yet complete surveillance will I believe be the most dangerous part of these programmes, not real-time surveillance. That wasn&#x27;t possible in the past, and is only just possible now.<p>So because of the future implications of a full-take on everyone&#x27;s life spanning decades and our developing abilities to make sense of all that data in instants, relating and cataloguing thousands of people, this is a qualitative change in surveillance capability, and these leaks have shed light on that in a way that previous ones have not.",1377091718

Among other things.<p><i>Airplanes produce less CO2 per passenger mile than buses.</i><p>Airplanes are used to travel much further distances than buses.  And by reducing the marginal cost of that travel, greatly increase the total amount traveled.  So while a typical daily motor vehicle trip is on the order of 35 miles (based on average annual miles driven in the US), air flights are typically 10-100 times that (300-3000) or more.  And with take-off and altitude gain, short-haul flights are relatively less efficient than long-haul.  The per-trip CO2 emissions are thus vastly higher -- you&#x27;re dividing by 2-4, but multiplying by 10-100.<p>Additionally, many of the modes listed on your reference can substitute electricity (which can be generated from non-fossil sources).  Heavier-than-air travel pretty much doesn&#x27;t exist without fossil fuels:  liquid hydrocarbons are simply too dense, cheap, and versatile a fuel and energy carrier.  The maths on biofuels simply don&#x27;t work out, except at very low fractions of existing fossil fuel use.  Substituting 10% of present oil consumption biofuels <i>might</i> be possible), but with an effective cost of $600/barrel or more, and that 10% would have to supply portable, emergency, and defense, as well as commercial aviation needs.  I see lighter-than-air craft as more viable in a not too distant future.<p><i>And if you do want to talk about CO2, how about CO2 per GDP?</i><p>That works out roughly to the amount of fossil fuels used per unit GDP, though it varies based on fuel source (which I don&#x27;t factor in).

Since you furthermore still rely on said nations for logistical reasons (and being friends with them likely couldn’t hurt anyhow), you might want to scale down your spying to accommodate the public perception. In addition, you’re hurting your own industry, especially service providers such as Google, Microsoft & Facebook, by giving the impression that it is unsafe to provide them with data.<p>From the perspective of the UK: I never quite got what you want to do, but you can’t expect to be even part of a free trade zone if you spy on the other member states of this free trade zone. This holds in particular if it is revealed that said spying is not necessarily restricted to catching terrorists, but also might get your domestic companies some trade secrets, which <i>really</i> doesn’t bode well in other member states that pride themselves on their innovation.

The parts that we sell that are not build on demand have usually been created within two weeks. There is nothing dusty in the warehouse, it just doesn&#x27;t stay around.<p>This is all possible because of flexible tooling and processes. We get our raw material from all over the country, and a small portion of the parts are sourced internationally. I would bet/hope the future looks somewhat like the path we are on. Many consumers seem to want similar things as everyone else, just a little different and custom.<p>As for depreciation, on a small scale the Section 179 provision works quite well for us. The IRS will let you deduct $500,000 per year in the same year the equipment was put into service(1). As long as I don&#x27;t spend more than $500,000 that year on equipment, then no depreciation schedule needed, just take it all that year. An operation the size of mine can&#x27;t spend that much anyway!<p>I own a few 3D printers, and after using them I am not worried about my future. I think the most likely outcome of better machines in the &#x27;push button, make stuff&#x27; area will just be more and more complex items that are built on shorter runs. Infrastructure is good enough to get products shipped around easily. So I think in the future will be small operations like mine making semi-custom stuff more complex than you can make yourself. It will be like printing, the desktop printer brought the ability to make nice printouts home but it didn&#x27;t kill high speed offset printing. Now we get high speed offset printing with each copy able to have each print with a different picture and wording. As domestic tools get better, so do industrial tools. Someone using a tool everyday can afford much better tools than a hobbyist.<p>Also consider time - A 3D printer might take 8 hours to print that Yoda figurine, and Amazon is trying to get you the molded one in a couple of hours. As long as you live in an urban area, you would still be faster with Amazon.<p>0. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_in_time_(business)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_in_time_(business)</a>\n1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_179_depreciation_deduction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_179_depreciation_deduct...</a>",1377090424

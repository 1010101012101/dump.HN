I would suspect like others have that it is a matter of location. If you are fee to head for CA then I would do so. Now is a good time to be out there. What I have been finding is that their are a lot of contracts but not a lot of W2 perm jobs. You kind of have to figure out the contracting gig and float from contract to contract right now, if you are in other areas. Once you figure that out there is plenty of work, is just how you find it. I sometimes wonder when I read these articles about the post-job economy if this is what they are talking about. If it is, and everything is going to be contract based then it is going to kind of stink for all parties involved only the candidate that are good at sales and marketing will find the work (fortunately for me, I have at least passable skills in them).

Removing small pieces, filling small gaps (which gives the maps the distinctive look of dense roads being filled in, creating chunky blocks), and simplifying boundaries.<p>All the rendering happens on picloud.com, which has been a really robust part of our infrastructure.

There are fewer password hashes (or plain text) floating around in random databases.  You can change your password once, and change it for numerous passwords.  It is just easier to maintain good security with one login instead of many.  It may not be more secure than a perfectly set-up browser and server; but surely it is in typical circumstances.<p>In the case of key fob style three factor authentication a shared secret usually needs to exist.  If the password hash, and the shared secret are stored on the same database; a hacker could get access by only needing to compromise that one server.  By offloading the three-factor to a third party you are reducing that risk.  Even with SMS style authentication a temporary shared secret exists (the contents of the text message).  Of course if you are using federated login, it does present a single point of failure.<p>You could argue that a private key is cryptographically better than a shared secret.  But if the client machine is compromised the additional security is useless; and just gives you a false sense of security.",1332882738

3763564,comment,3760460,3760858,1,0,dxbydt,,,"The family of problems where computing is non-deterministic and there is no single right answer is very large. Many gossiping algorithms belong to that family, as do several finance problems with an underlying stochastic model. Here's a very practical problem that I solve everyday that can benefit hugely from Ungar's model of nondeterministic concurrent computation : a bank makes n loans, with each loan having a different probability of default. The loans are all connected by a covariance matrix ie. given any two loans (p,q), we have a best guess of the chances of p defaulting if q defaults. At the end of 1 year, m of those n loans will default. But today, right now, the bank has to submit to the Fed its best guess of how much money it might lose at the end of next year! In finance, we call this ""estimation of the conditional value at risk"" aka cvar estimation. There is no <i>right</i> answer, m and n are in the millions, the covariance matrix is huge, the number of possible losses is scala.math.pow(2,m) which is essentially un-computable for even a very small m like 100 loans, so it is out of the question if m is millions of loans. Yet I perform this very calculation using a modest 100,000 simulations ( via Actors in Scala, 1 Monte Carlo simulation becomes 1 Actor iterating over a list of loans & computing their losses concurrently ). While I sort of converge to an answer, the computation is non-deterministic, there is no real right answer, and Ungar's model would be a clear win for this problem.",1332882570

It feels like I have to know the internals of git workings just to perform a simple action, and I need to know all the side-effects of its actions, and how to fix those as well. With mercurial all the commands I need to know are hg log, diff, incoming, outgoing, pull, update push and merge. With git I need to know at least two or three flags for each command where each flag is really special to that command and using/not using it changes everything. With mercurial I just know -p -r and -l for limits thats it.<p>I hate git with a passion now.

It's the poor man's identity federation.<p>Before I start, let me make myself very clear - I think Dan did an awesome job with Foamicate. Seriously. One guy. The balls to put something out there that's innovative and seeks to solve a REAL problem. I'm impressed. And if I were in a position to, I'd ask Dan to work for me.<p>That said, it's worth (IMO) considering what an identity system <i>should</i> provide -<p>User Control and Consent: An identity system should only reveal information identifying a user with the user's consent. The Facebook/Google/OpenId model fails this one.<p>Minimal Disclosure for a Constrained Use: The solution that discloses the least amount of identifying information and best limits its use is the most stable long-term solution. Again, OpenId falls short in that the identity provider knows where the user is going.<p>Justifiable Parties: Digital identity systems must be designed so the disclosure of identifying information is limited to parties having a necessary and justifiable place in a given identity relationship. Microsoft Passport is a great example of why this's a bad idea.<p>Directed Identity: A universal identity system must support both ""omni-directional"" identifiers for use by public entities and ""unidirectional"" identifiers for use by private entities, thus facilitating discovery while preventing unnecessary release of correlation handles. My Facebook identity is public, but I can't and shouldn't use that to access a private resource like a collaboration site on my company's extranet.<p>Pluralism of Operators and Technologies: A universal identity system must channel and enable the inter-working of multiple identity technologies run by multiple identity providers. The part where anything that's exclusively browser-based fails. The same system should work online, from a phone, and from a PC or server running any arbitrary OS.<p>Human Integration: The universal identity metasystem must define the human user to be a component of the distributed system integrated through unambiguous human-machine communication mechanisms offering protection against identity attacks. UX. The usability problems with Foamicator have been discussed here already.<p>Consistent Experience Across Contexts: The unifying identity metasystem must guarantee its users a simple, consistent experience while enabling separation of contexts through multiple operators and technologies. A smart card is a good example of this - I have a card for cash, a loyalty card for coffee, and an access card for work. Using them is consistent, event though their context is not.<p>The only technology I know of that meets all 7 laws is information cards (Higgins Project, and CardSpace).

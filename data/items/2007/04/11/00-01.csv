While it would have been faster and easier to develop and launch with some money coming in (read, one less contract job necessary to get through the summer) that's no reason not to do it anymore.",1176253004

11625,comment,11551,11575,0,0,felipe,,,"Yes, you can! Save enough for six months to a year in basic living expenses -- that's your seed fund. While you save, keep moonlighting on your project. Your seed-fund will empower you to make the right decision when the time comes (i. e.: When your project gets traction). And you can always do consulting gigs if you need more money.",1176251667

Our background is in medicine.  We lack the technology part yet understand the 'gaps' in medicine that technology is needed. It's like Steve Case and his dive into medicine with revolutionhealth.<p>Anyways, going to give it a go for another program but this time using our strength - medicine.  Any hacker out there want to give it a shot with us in the other program application, we have some great ideas that combines the internet, medicine, health insurance etc.  Tired of hiring programmers, we need a real partner who can program since my programming ability is still newbish.  <p>Give me an e-mail ;)",1176249643

Hands up who thinks mandatory checks on vehicles brakes and other basic safety systems is a bad thing? I think I see pg&#x27;s hand at the back there. But in general the vast vast majority of people think mandatory insurance is a good idea. That&#x27;s why nearly all developed countries require it by law.<p>The thing is that instead of making these things &quot;expected&quot; because of market forces, imposing it by law makes it a default for everyone and it becomes a box to tick when you want to operate a taxi, just like many other things. And you end up with people who simply do not give a shit at all about consumer experience and providing a good service at all. That&#x27;s the key difference with countries were taxis have less regulations: people actually compete on service, for the benefit of everyone, not just the few who are taxi drivers and running a monopoly provided by the State.<p>With this attitude you end up with Taxi drivers who do this job because they see it as a rent, not as a way to make a difference on the market. Yeah, that&#x27;s the spirit!",1412596741

Hands up who thinks mandatory checks on vehicles brakes and other basic safety systems is a bad thing? I think I see pg&#x27;s hand at the back there. But in general the vast vast majority of people think mandatory insurance is a good idea.

Old me&#x27;s gain.<p>One idea, that I think could be expressed as one of those movements which encompass science, art and philosophy starts with the definition of history, which basically defines history as stuff people wrote about things that happened. Prehistory is the stuff that happened before with a hundred years of commentary, nuance, various waves of correctness and such. But, arbitrary demarkations are uncomfortable. We much prefer a nice definable river or mountain range to act as our border than a straight line on a map. As definition go, history&#x27;s in an interesting one. Someone writes about a guy who was the king, that&#x27;s history. Someone finds bones and a fancy hat in a lavish grave, that&#x27;s prehistory.<p>Now, by that definition we&#x27;re running into some interesting hockey stick phenomenon.

Video phones and space blimps. Alien invasions and human colonization of new worlds. Fantasies of mixed specie societies reflecting our struggles to transcend ethnicity and culture.

I imagine that my own experience working to support PhD candidates and post-docs a decade ago is instructive. The TL-DR: failed start-up.<p>I went back to school during the post-2001 recession and found myself with a job writing signal processing software to make sense of the data coming off an experimental mass spectrometer. I was offered a job by our lead researcher (a post-doc) upon graduation who saw an opportunity to turn a grant into a private lab. There were some political and University-inspired patent spin-off aspects, too.<p>The lab was built to create a product that used, but had little to do with, his research. I got a rag mag and a poster session publication credit from the early company efforts to build an in-house mass spectrometry device before he left and returned to being a post-doc (he is now a tenured professor). The people left steering the company ballooned the corporate efforts using off-the-shelf tech to rush a product to market just as the 2008 crash impacted and the targeted customer base (people wanting spa-like boutique medical tests to determine which vitamins they should take) evaporated. I was dismissed in the first wave of the toilet spiral and the company ceased to exist 18 months later.<p>The point behind my story is that as the pool of post-docs increases, we are more likely to see more adventures like the one I went through. Some of these start-ups will succeed, leading to a survivor-bias feedback loop at the policy level that we need even more STEM students to feed the start-up machine, leading to growth.<p>I have no doubt that this will, in fact, work as a growth engine.

According to Jun Tateno, a former NISA scientist, TEPCO did not react to these warnings and did not respond with any measures.[35]<p>Filmmaker Adam Curtis mentioned the risks of the type of boiling water reactors cooling systems such as those in Fukushima I,[36] and claimed the risks were known since 1971[37] in a series of documentaries in the BBC in 1992 and advised that PWR type reactors should have been used.<p>Fukushima had been warned their seawall was insufficient to withstand a powerful tsunami, but the seawall height was not raised in response&quot;<p>Still no indication of greed, sloppiness, cut-corner mentality and general incompetence?",1412593873

For 2 days that was a news, but later nobody paid much attention on it.<p>In Poland in order to become taxi driver one needs to fulfill a number of conditions (only people who never comitted a crime are allowed a licence, must be physically and mentally healthy) a then pass the &quot;city knowladge&quot; exam. Exam is obligatory only in cites larger then 100K. And that&#x27;s all.<p>Due to competition taxi prices are kept on resonable level, so taxi companies are competing by having nicer cars, being highly available (wating for a taxi longer then 10 min is unusual), offering loyalty cards, cummulative invoicing at the end of the month, etc.<p>Uber can compete with lower prices - they have promised to be 20% cheaper. It is not clear however cheaper from which price - premium taxi companies (about 60 cents per kilometer) or cheap services (40 cents per kilometer).<p>There are other questions as well - would Uber be able to provide invoices, if not, it is not a deal for many people.<p>Even if I pay less (10% less?), I don&#x27;t think I will risk riding with someone who might be totally unfit for the job and does not know city.

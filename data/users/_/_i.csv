The Bitcoin market moves exceptionally fast and for developers, that means that they don&#x27;t have time to integrate 20 different APIs from all over the net, let alone create accounts with all of them. Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if you could just integrate one cryptographically secure API, write one line of code, and receive the current market rates for every available coin on every popular cryptocurrency exchange?<p>Bit API Hub allows developers to write very little code, integrate a short one file SDK, and call any API anywhere in the world through our custom designed gateway service. Our system integrates hundreds of APIs so you can always get the data you need right from a single API. If we don&#x27;t have the API you&#x27;re looking for, you can write a custom API call to tell our server where to find it and how to use it.<p>We support JSON responses from API servers who use the most popular response types, JSON, XML, and SOAP. If your desired API speaks a different language, we have you covered. Simply request the response in your desired API&#x27;s native language.<p>Check out what we&#x27;re building at http://bitapihub.com!",1416428438,1429477163

Today we offer a broad variety of services including web design, search engine optimization, graphic design, ecommerce design, flash design, application design, database design, blog design, digital flipbook design, 3d animation, social media design and a host of other services related to internet / web marketing. Our president was one of the original 3000 web developers online with a group called Webcom between 1992 and 1996.<p>Our portfolio of clients is very diverse; we have sites that are from individuals to large corporations and everything in between. Back in the late 90's and early 2000's we helped three of our clients get ready for public sale. Two of those companies also went public. Those same three companies are doing multi-million dollar sales online today and continue to grow each year.",1330114282,1426546805

Today I lead New Relic's product management team.<p>I'm a software engineer, first and foremost. But I love all aspects of the software business, which is why I've started two companies and tend to find day jobs in product management over development.<p>I've been heavily involved in open source projects (Selenium & Struts/WebWork) and have written a couple of books on the subject. My past two startups have been involved in the website testing and performance world.<p>Most importantly: I have a wonderful wife and daughter.",1237817847,1449701067

It was love at first sight.  Now he spends most of his time figuring out the amazing business implications of the high concurrency prowess of Erlang and evangelizing the merits of AppEngine to other start-ups in New York and Athens, Greece.<p>In his life before SocialCaddy, Nikos worked for non-geeky brands like VOGUE and The Wall Street Journal.

Youll probably be able to see this within my writings on this website. As is obvious I also like to write. Not just blogging, but short stories, poetry that doesnt really sound like poetry and music. Sport is another activity I enjoy thoroughly (soccer, squash and bicycle riding are my favs :D ). By living in Brisbane, Australia I get to have many opportunities to participate in many communities that like what I like, which is always fun.<p>Love me, or even try to get annoyed at me, through what Im going to be writing, your going to find something different about me. I dont really like to follow blogging rules, such as sticking with one strict topic, and Im going to attempt to generate some humor in what I write it may not be funny to you, but Ill be having a ball writing it.<p>Now that you know at least what It seems I like in a real life (yes, its true, theres another perfect world away from this screen. all you have to do is tilt and turn your head to the left), why not sit back, grab some pop-corn, coke, a few chocolates, throw one chocolate to me, and start reading through my interesting blog posts.<p>I hope you have a lovely day",1202523086,1202523086

I am really self taught since 2000. A site that knows about hackers, backdoors, virus,etc.I just found you today working on Tool Bars. I was up late last night trying to get somebody to tell me what a PAGE RANK was and its function and why and where was it suspose to be on my Tool Bars and I worked and after almost crashing my computer I found it on the wrong Tool Bar by somebody else, which I never found out until a man e-mailed me from Finland to help and I was real close and he helped me finish the correction. I was worried because I didn't and could not find any site about its function and was told by Google to go to (over their head) to Technology Overview and no help there. I found Aardvark site and through them I got help from that nice guy from Finland. Long story short, I do worry in protecting my Computer. I am glad I found you.

My team and I are confident and ready to show you the product that is going to capture the local online advertising industry.<p>PAIN: Brick-and-mortar businesses lack a solution that increase loyal customers. Groupon drives new traffic, but this new traffic is un-targeted and does not return as repeat customers; Foursquare cannot verify check-ins and are thus not used by business owners for loyalty programs. The current Daily Deal model has no long term sustainability for local merchants and is extremely costly.<p>SOLUTION: DidYouFindADeal is a web and mobile application that uses the simplicity of a very proven model (MoneyMailer / ValPak) with the marketing techniques of the Daily Deal Sites. Users Never have to Pre Pay for a Coupon or Deal and Business Owners DO NOT revenue share with us.<p>FUNDING & LOCATION: We have raised $300,000 in seed funding and are located in Irvine, CA.<p>TEAM: Our team and advisory board members have Internet Marketing, Local Advertising, IT, International Business and Legal experience as noted in their bios.<p>TRACTION:<p>During Beta attracted over 800 merchants to a Free Trial in a 45 day period with 2 sales people.\nPost revenue with 20+ customers closed \n70+ businesses in the pipeline including Tustin Buick, Togos, and Arthur Murray Dance Studios. Affiliate programs with Starbucks, Wine.com, Omaha Steaks and more. \nCompletion of mobile app for iPhone and Android",1332815024,1452901076

dipesh_batheja,,2,0.0,17,2,"Hi, I am Dipesh Batheja, web technologies specialist based in New Delhi, India. Obsessed with building beautiful web based software, you can find me in meditative state with my Macbook, building one thing or the other. Nirvana!<p>I started as an independent web developer offering programming services based on .Net framework. Well, I have to admit that in those early days I considered ASP.net to be the best web app framework and C# to be the greatest programming language. In my opinion they were one of the best technologies to write cleaner and more beautiful code but it was not until early 2006, when I discovered even more amazing stuff.<p>ASP.net and C# were nice, but there was still dissatisfaction, so I started to search for some open source frameworks as &quot;alternative&quot;. When I saw what RubyOnRails could do, the clouds parted and the angels started singing. Since then, I have been riding on Rails with my cowboy hats on and firing even more cleaner, shorter and beautiful code from my new super weapon, Ruby. Enlightenment!<p>With time my consulting business grew and client requested more services. So in order to meet the requirements of my clients reliably, I began to build the team in early 2008 to offer wide range of web development services and http://www.NetlingsHQ.com into the existence. Since then many entrepreneurs, web design firms, teams and freelancers have discovered Netlings&#x27; website production services as the most efficient way to convert their beautiful web designs into functional websites.<p>In spare time, I can be found watching movies, listening music, traveling, sleeping, playing badminton or thinking/dreaming about building the next big thing on the Internet. Thats the long and the short of it. Thanks for stopping by!",1340012527,1450207814

kimberleyhansen,0,1,0.0,0,0,"Kim Hansen is the Executive Producer and CEO at Voxiter Technologies. A veteran web/mobile/video game designer and thought leader, she cut her teeth as QA Team Lead for Mass Effect 1 and 2 at BioWare  where she worked closely with the design team to create one of the best-loved video game franchises in history, selling over 7 million copies worldwide.<p>A distinctly technical, creative mind, Kim is an expert at doing much with little — in 2013, she lead the design team on the highly-rated Everlove: Rose, a project with Silicon Sisters. She went on to lead a small team of creatives and developers to create a never-before-seen user experience for the successfully greenlit EON Altar, a table-top roleplaying adventure to be enjoyed by up to 4 players using mobile devices as controllers.<p>Moving on from games, Kim and socilogica&#x27;s CTO Mike Cora worked together to create socilogica.’s Rewardlogic gamified customer engagement platform. Rewardlogic features a fully scriptable RPG engine and iBeacon augmented reality. The platform is currently installed at dozens of Harley-Davidson® dealerships around the world.<p>Early in 2015, Kim left socilogica. to begin ideation on Voxiter and to join BlackPurl Technologies as a Senior Interaction Consultant. There, Kim worked with a small team of area experts and outsourcing partners MetaCube Software to create BlackPurl MVP, a gamified Point of Sale and Order Processing solution. The Minimum Viable Product the team created was instrumental in raising a $3M seed round.<p>Skills: Business Development, UX/UI Design, Information Design, Game Design, Web and Mobile Development, Product Development, Process Improvement, Creative Coordination, Quality Assurance, Focus Testing, Certification, Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator/Premiere, HTML/CSS/SASS, JavaScript, Perforce/SVN, Atlassian JIRA/Confluence, MS Word/Excel/PowerPoint, Windows/OSX",1425435412,1453173005

Strategy in place to have the platforms generate instant returns with potential of USD 1 Million in the first year with projected revenue of around USD 1 Billion by year 6. Its not in competiton with twitter, facebook, foursquare etc. Our idea coners the smart phone and internet market but our focus on development is 70% mobile phone and 30% web. I feel we have come up with a strong idea for which there is a mayor market growing daily and have the right marketing plan in place.

Before Bookpad I was working at Amazon as an SDE and I have had the unique opportunity to work on some innovative projects related to Cloud Computing. Also, I have previously worked with Sourcebits, a startup that’s now funded by Sequoia Capital. Over the past four years I have held various posts and has been awarded numerous awards for his leadership skills and contribution towards starting technology groups and fostering new innovative ideas. My main areas of interest include Machine Learning and Cloud Computing and I look to apply them in my work.<p>I have participated and won in a number of hackathons. Some of the interesting hacks include &quot;A augmented reality translation app&quot; which detects english text, translates into Hindi and overlays onto the initial text, &quot;CV Miner&quot; which helps companies shortlist resumes of potential employees, this is done by mining unstructured data from the resume and applying ML classification techniques. The other interesting hacks include &quot;Route prediction for late packages&quot; and &quot;Severe event detection&quot; using crawled data.<p>I am an avid book reader and love to play squash.

I&#x27;ve worked on open-source projects, side projects, etc, but most of my time I spent working exclusively on Scribd and Parse. I ran DevOps at Scribd and at Parse (until I found amazing folks to take over those roles). I was on &quot;pager duty&quot; for many years at Scribd, and then again for the first year of Parse. I&#x27;ve done everything from fundraising to engineering to sales to sysadmin to biz dev to DevOps to waking up 7 times in one night when my database kept falling over. I promptly fell over myself the next day.<p><i>Background:</i><p>I studied theoretical physics in graduate school, although I was not a physics major in undergrad (Dartmouth, Econ and CS, summa cum laude). I&#x27;ve been programming since I was 12 years old. I made a 3000 LOC RPG that absolutely no other person was interested in.

Are way underused in the whole gaming and content creation industry. We want to enable casual users to build their own games in less than five minutes with minimal input. With the aid of our robots.<p>I think startups can ""kill hollywood"" by simply building better tools which lowers the barriers of entriy to content creation. If a Hollywood title didn't cost $100m, but instead if anyone could build better movies than Hollywood in a few minutes. Then we wouldn't have to worry about them. We're not there yet, but I want to do my small part to get as close to that vision as possible. So let's build better tools!<p>Do you like robots? Do you like games?

I think a lot about design mentoring, community, education, and professionalism.<p>I regularly provide advice around or references for early-stage business and customer development, user and market research, hardware and software prototyping, and on how to recruit designers.  I&#x27;ve worked with seven startups through the Longhorn Startup entrepreneurship program at the University of Texas at Austin (including Lynx Laboratories and AirType), and dozens of others through office hours or consulting engagements.<p>My consulting availability is limited, and I give preference to emerging technologies (Internet of Things, wearables, drones, generative design), social entrepreneurship and community development, and startups.<p>However, I will also <i>barter</i> UX for art or development; iOS, front-end, Python, or AWS (via Python) are all of interest.<p>I&#x27;ve started five startups myself so far, so I have some idea about what you&#x27;re going through.

Long Live SEO v2. <p>We're global, serving a global list of clients responding to a global marketplace.<p>Most people finally agree that SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is dead. Google has effectively made the concept of blanketing the Internet with repetitious and irrelevant media ineffective and with good reason.<p>Simply put, the purpose of a search engine is to deliver relevant results. In the past, traditional SEO techniques made it possible to 'trick' or 'engineer' those results.<p>So its no surprise that Google, Bing and other search engines will have been actively working on methods to knock back useless content that serves to dilute the Internet. Duplicate or irrelevant content is of little value when you're searching for something.<p>So whats the answer?<p>WireNews+Co has been advising our members against posting their media through multiple websites since 2001. Today, it makes more sense than ever to deliver your message to the right audience. Today, blasting your media out to the World, without a specific target audience in mind will actually reduce the overall value of your message.<p>Your compelling, relevant content delivered to the right audience will generate the kind of results youre looking for without the tricks of the past.",1357291435,1452908599

It doesn't perform very quickly though, because of the hashing operations needed during insert.<p>A Bloom filter is great for P2P search applications for example. Then peers can pass Bloom filters around, and an initial search can happen locally. If it succeeds then the search can ask the remote host if the file actually exists. The frequency those remote requests will fail depends on the number of false positives the Bloom filter is configured to give (ie, a function of its size).",1290264806

Horizontal? I didn't realize PHP was so geometric. What an interesting concept.<p><i>While traits are technically different from mixins – they are both designed to fill the same gap left by a single-parent inheritance model</i><p>So let me try and get this straight: mixins fill a gap left by a single-parent inheritance model and so traits are like mixins because PHP has a single-inheritance model but traits are technically different in some way?<p>This is getting confusing...<p>Python, Perl, Ruby, and many languages with multiple inheritance have been using mixins for... well a long time. It's pretty straight forward.<p>Perl5 got ""roles"" through Moose and Perl6 has them natively. I think they're explanations are a little more clear.

What an interesting way to think about it.<p><i>Conflicts and Aliases</i><p>Ok, this is pretty cool. It's an edge case, but there's already a solution. Neat.<p>Oh... wait a second, I think I've found the meat of it:<p><i>Trait method definitions support all modifiers just like regular class methods do – that includes visibility modifiers, final, static and abstract. The latter can be used to define abstract methods expressing requirements for this particular trait</i><p>So this is how they're slightly different than regular-old classes? By being able to use all the same keywords as regular old classes?<p>It seems that the meat of it is at the very end:<p><i>Traits only take part in the process of building a class and do not add any new run-time semantics. That means that usual PHP object-oriented functionality (like late static bindings) work as expected when combined with traits.</i><p>But this next one is a bit of a gotcha:<p><i>Traits can be composed from other traits (the same way classes use traits).</i><p>Wait... what? Why would you want to do this? You're just getting back into hierarchies again... and pretty much just working around multiple-inheritance without calling it such.<p>It's good to see PHP is evolving. Most people still think of PHP4 and shudder (and rightfully so). Evolving means it might be catching up to the superior languages it competes with in the web space.

If a link in the iOS twitter app opens Maps, the only way to get back to where you were (pre-iOS4) was to hit home and launch the twitter app... which may have saved its state. In Android, such a workflow would just involve pressing the universal back button. I suppose in iOS4, you can now double tap home and find the twitter app in the list of open apps.<p>That's not to say Android is better for opening map links from twitter... just that it's a different way of doing things. I would say that most criticisms people have when jumping from android to iOS (or vice versa) stem from trying to use one OS in exactly the same way you used the other OS.",1290262702

1924519,comment,1924331,1924331,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"This is almost up-votable.<p>The thing that is it missing is, oddly enough, the very thing we see in large organizations that try agile: accountability. That is, if you have a small team building a web site for a startup, you either do the job well or you starve. If you have a larger team working as part of a 1200-team project to build product X, you just play the game, doing your best to look good and keep your immediate bosses happy. Organizations have traditionally set up large bureaucracies -- to manage agile teams. Sounds totally crazy, and it is, but we have to keep reminding organizations that agile means distributed control and accountability, not just the same teams doing the same thing inside a complex organizational structure just with a different name and emphasis on stuff.<p>In American government, job responsibilities are purposely split up between the federal, state, and local government. In addition, each level has three different branches to handle different kinds of work: making laws, enforcing laws, interpreting laws. The idea here is that if your local elected official wants to outlaw bazookas in town, and the townspeople don't like it, they can march down to his office (or home) and ask him to do something about it. That's what is called accountability. Governments ""closer"" to the people are traditionally given more power over their lives, and those ""farther away"" -- like in Washington -- are given less control. (This is one of the ways gun control used to work so well. You lived in a crowded city, local officials can tell you not to have guns in such close proximity. You live on the open range, nobody cared what type of weapon you owned. You can continue making this analogy with other forms of state control, such as abortion or property taxes) In this way our agile government teams can have timeboxed work and get regular feedback. Timeboxing and feedback are critical parts of agile. (Also note how critical timeboxing becomes in government. You don't want <i>instant</i> feedback -- that's mob rules. You also don't want <i>no</i> feedback. You must have <i>regular</i> feedback for the thing to work)<p>The problem is that the federal government is taking control of everything. Also the districts have been rigged so that most federal elected officials always get reelected: its becoming like a new nobility.  This means that effectively there are no timeboxes and everything is being controlled from the top-down. Can't have agile teams in an environment like that. You can have sales picthes, feel-good meetings, wonderful speeches about change, and marketing plans, but you can't have agile.<p>The author's heart is in the right place, though. [People get so worked up about <i>what</i> they want government to do that they never get around to talking about <i>how</i> it does it. If the overall structure is bad, the results are going to be bad.]",1290262431

This leads people to pay more attention and be more careful when faced with a roundabout, which in turn leads to safer driving generally.  If this psychological observation is correct, then what scares us about switching to roundabouts in the U.S. might be exactly what will make it safer to adopt them.<p>Also, Slate had a piece on roundabouts and safety with the following quote:<p>""Mentioning roundabouts seems to invoke some form of the famous ""availability bias,"" which leads people make judgments based on the memories that can be brought most easily to mind. And so, the American who may have driven as a tourist in France or Greece a number of years back will shudder with recognition, associating the roundabout with terror and near misses.

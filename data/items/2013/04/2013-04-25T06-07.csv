5606014,comment,5604837,5605933,1,0,jdotjdot,,,"That can't be right. First, your Delta study is woefully lacking in school - specific information. Second, the college confidential link's methodology seems to be missing a lot to me, particularly in the way of revenue. For example, for many universities (eg UPenn) the parking department is actually a huge revenue driver that must be taken into account to calculate overall university P&L, and that kind of thing is completely ignored here. Schools are businesses; you can't just ignore the other sources of revenue. As such, those estimates are hugely over inflated. Is Yale really spending $100k PER STUDENT each year? How could that possibly be?<p>Let's look at Stanford. Wolfram Alpha claims 6532 undergrads, $37380 tuition per year. If student cost was truly double tuition, Stanford would be operating at a loss of $244.4MM per year, and (all other considerations aside) the $12.6BB endowment would be gone in 50 years. 
Ultimately, the reported cost is often based on some key assumptions that aren't always stated, and I'm pretty sure we as a population don't actually have much clarity on the true cost of educating a student, if it's even possible to really quantify such a thing (try measuring the monetary cost of creating a supportive environment or a caring teacher).",1366872583

5606002,comment,5603782,5605562,3,0,hysan,,,"I was in your shoes about a decade ago, but without the perfect SAT scores (though still top notch). While applying to colleges, I got an interesting piece of advice from friends I met during math and science competitions (these are all people who are in the top 1% of US high school students in these fields). They said to pick one of the schools in my list of top choices and apply directly to their engineering (or equivalent) school. Then fill in the major field with something that fits my credentials perfectly even if I'm still unsure what to pursue.<p>Their reasoning goes that the engineering sections of Ivys often don't attract the very best candidates (Ivy League engineering << MIT, CMU, etc.) in these fields. So by applying in this manner, you end up competing against an ""easier"" pool of applicants. The major bit adds icing to your application as it makes you appear to be a focused student and allows the school to fulfill career diversity goals. Of course, all of this is just speculation but for the Ivys that rank their engineering schools separately, it is pretty clear that it would be much easier to get into those schools.<p>So I took this advice and that one school ended up being the only school that didn't reject/waitlist me (none of my waitlists even panned out). Once you get in, just bust your ass freshman year and ""transfer"" into the general school. Or if you decide to do engineering anyway, change majors (what I ended up doing).<p>This is just one anecdote and admissions may very well be fair. However, I don't think it is naive for anyone to think otherwise because the perception is shared by many educated people.",1366872288

5605981,comment,5603782,5605589,8,0,cturner,,,"It's easy to game this, and there's overwhelming evidence that this already happens in related fields. In countries with state schools with geographic catchment (i.e. most of most English speaking countries), the housing market becomes a proxy for education choice.<p>This entrenches class concentration. You end up with entire geographic regions that are exclusive, and others that are outcast. People who want their kids to be able to be at a certain school value catchment housing higher than others would. As a result, there's a slide of people who care about their kids' education towards certain regions. By consequence, there's a drain of people who are focussed on their kids' education in poorer areas. This pushes parents who would otherwise have been easy-going to join in the same game, which re-enforces the pattern.<p>There are plenty of crazy people with a burning, status-seeking ambition to have their child go to medschool (regardless of the wishes of the child). They would absolutely move their address to a catchment for easy access to med school. In the list of the crazy things these crazy people do, this would be among the least surprising.<p>Regarding schools - there's a policy that would kill this and lead to better schools, called vouchers. In this case, parents apply to schools (anywhere) and the schools choose who they take.<p>But it's very difficult to introduce this  when you have a large, highly educated segment of your voting population who are struggling with a huge mortgage that they took on to secure their children access to a certain school catchment. As they see it - they've paid for something, and now the evil government is stealing that from them and leaving their children to compete on an even footing with the children of parents who haven't made the same sacrifices. ""Outrageous!""<p>Teachers unions also come out hard against vouchers, because it makes the sector more competitive, and that leads to bad teachers getting fired, and wage discrepancy, which undermines the union interest of bringing the sector towards collectivised bargaining.<p>There's social-engineering arguments that say it's better for people use facilities near them to reduce load on transportation or the like. This is petty rubbish, and also often wrong (mass transit gets more efficient and nicer to use with scale, and that leads to less cars), but it gets trotted out in vouchers debate.<p>Public universities tend to operate on a voucher arrangement at the moment. Their example is a tangible example that vouchers is good policy, and that is very valuable in the campaign to bring good policy to public schools.",1366871853
5605980,comment,5604598,5605927,2,0,graycat,,,"""You're caught up in your story:""<p>I just know what the heck I'm talking
about.<p>As I wrote in this thread over and over, 
it's US citizens, via gifts or taxes, e.g.,
taxes from Joe and Mary, that is paying for
most of any education in a well known US
college or university.  So, in particular,
there's no way a foreigner is paying his/her
way; the foreigner is getting an education
mostly paid for by US citizens.<p>For the graduate student who gets a stipend
for work grading papers or working
in a lab for a prof, that's mostly just 
make work.  I've done it as a grad student,
and I've hired it as a prof.  I will say
that when I was teaching calculus at a
Big Ten school as a grad student I was
earning my keep.<p>The NSF wrote into its grant
contracts that students must be supported
as a way to get more STEM grad students,
not because the NSF wanted those students
to contribute to 'research' but because the
NSF economists did a calculation to see how
to increase STEM graduate degree labor 
in the US labor market.<p>So, sure stockholders of United Technologies,
GE, Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, etc. like the idea
of the NSF generating more STEM Master's
degrees, but Joe and Mary can see that their
tax money is not getting their children
through college but is getting foreign students
through grad school to compete with their
children should they manage to get through
grad school.  So Joe and Mary have a right
to feel ripped off.<p>""Not a handout (in part) to foreigners.""<p>No, that basically is what is going on,
and because the NSF insists so, and so
insists because the NSF wants, as I explained,
to participate in 'US national manpower management',

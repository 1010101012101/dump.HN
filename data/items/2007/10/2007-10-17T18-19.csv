The first couple of years are arguably the hardest, and most formative part, of the whole operation.",1192647279

69157,comment,69093,69101,0,0,CHIEFARCHITECT,,,"Good viewpoint.  As the PM/Marketing guy of a wireless startup, am working with a small product team. Always find it to be challenging to remind the team to focus on developing a product for the needs of the marketplace not what they think they like.   Seen too many teams lose track of what they are doing.  In most cases, it is their project manager that fails to build a Tangible Vision that the team collaboratively connect to..",1192646688
69156,story,,,14,26,revolvingcur,"Dispensing with a Co-founder",,"I'm in an uncomfortable position.  I've been working with a partner in my spare time on gathering information for a business I want to start, and we had a meeting to discuss incorporation (as in, fill in the blanks on the filing and put postage on it).<p>My about-to-be co-founder expressed hesitation.  He's an undergrad student who left university for several years to work in IT, then returned and basically had to start over, so he's got a couple of years left, while I'm graduating in about seven months.<p>Effectively, he said that he didn't want to incorporate because the expense (90 bucks, if) wouldn't be justified if the venture failed, plus we'd be out the $35 required to formally dissolve.<p>Instead, we just bought a couple of domains from GoDaddy, and a year of hosting.<p>As you can imagine, this left me unsettled and severely doubting his commitment. The idea is going to be very capital-intensive, and simply can't tolerate founders who are going to waver on it.  Although he brings some pretty good knowledge and connections, I wouldn't call him indispensable.  My biggest concern going forward would be not having enough time to find a better co-founder, since the window of opportunity for this business is somewhat narrow.<p>We've got excellent personal rapport, but I don't think I can choose short-term goodwill over the chance to build something great.  Sanity check?  Advice?",1192646684

Since the iphone doesn't have full GPS capabilities, I don't see this as really being a threat to Loopt at all.

69151,comment,69022,69062,0,0,waleedka,,,"This is a very good observation, and being a programmer I do see and feel the change. However, there is another force at play at the same time which pulls in the other direction: because software development got cheaper, there is more competition, and that makes it more critical than ever to be able to get the word out and build market share quickly before the other 50 competitors take it. So, the marketing guys can still make a huge difference. The idea guys, probably not so much.",1192645810

From what I've read, a VC is much better versed in the legal aspects of funding companies and has more money and time to spend on legalities.  This makes it much easier for the VC to exert influence on the legal side of the financing equation.  If legal proceedings become standardized, VCs will lose the legal bargaining chip.",1192645723

Two weeks ago I talked to my partners and they recommended that I take some time to think about what I need to make myself healthy again, totally irrespective of what impact that would have on the business. <p>It was today when I tried getting back into work again by focusing on the most simple of tasks, and I got deer-in-headlights syndrome again -- for the first time since I started my break. One moment back-in-the-game and it felt like I'd had no break at all. So, more time is needed I think.<p>I agree 100% that health and relationships are most important. I noticed that I was no longer responding to emails from family and friends, and my health was declining. I tried to take action on these more recently but it was a little too late to have enough impact.<p>If the business was anywhere near stable, it would be a different story, but in our product development we're currently facing an uphill battle wearing rollerskates -- if we're not advancing, we're sliding backwards due to our burn rate and the seasonal nature of our market.",1192645027

Presumably they have employed the help of some of the Sidekick developers for this. <p>With the Sidekick service you first have to prove that you are a developer, and they give you a key which unlocks the phone for development access. When you have developed a stable app, you submit it to through an approval process and then the application is made available on the Sidekick/T-Mobile app site.<p>If this is the case with Apple, then they could control app approval, distribution, and even pricing through iTunes. It will likely be tightly controlled.",1192644112

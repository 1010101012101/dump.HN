2979070,comment,2978027,2978623,5,0,FilterJoe,,,"Anvil of Stars also my favorite Greg Bear book. Nobody read my review of this book on Amazon, so perhaps this is a better place for it:<p>I've read hundreds of science fiction books where humans have military conflict with aliens (though not yet the Forge of God). In nearly all of them, there are World-War-II-Naval-like space battles with weapons/ships/shields at near parity. I have always thought this to be highly implausible, and I thought an interesting aspect of this book was to consider three possible battle situations in space:<p>1) Your ship encounters a ship at a vastly higher tech level. If they detect you before you detect them, you are dead. Period. Your only possibility to win such a battle is to detect them first and destroy them instantly - and your chances of being able to do that are slim.<p>2) Your ship encounters a ship at a vastly lower tech level. Using the logic above, all that matters is you being able to detect them before they detect you. The technologies of stealth, electronic counter measures, detection, etc. are therefore all extremely vital in order to never be defeated by aliens with a lower tech level.<p>3) There is a possibility that you encounter an enemy close enough to your own tech level that the battle could last more than a split second. It is only in these instances that all the other things often written in other science fiction stories might matter - amount and type of shielding, weapons systems, quality of personnel, etc. But such battles are very unlikely, because technological progress is so fast. Consider what it would be like for any of today's industrialized nations with a substantial military to combat the most powerful nation on earth from 200 years ago - there would be no contest at all. The universe has been around for billions of years, so the chance of two races encountering each other that are within a few hundred years of each others' technology level is very low.<p>The above logic also applies to planetary defense as well, though with even more emphasis on not being detected.<p>This is the only SF book I've read that envisions future military conflict this way, and for that I give the book 4 stars. In my mind, this clearly deserves a place among the top 10 science fiction books in the military SF genre.<p>However, I did not care for the characters and character development and dialog which occupied the sluggish first half of the book. It wasn't until they started exploring the killers home system that I had trouble putting the book down. I did enjoy the dialog about ethical considerations of what the human ship was going to do, and the aliens they joined forces with were an interesting twist to the story and well done.<p>Bottom Line - the key to this book for me was an exploration of military encounters in space that struck me as vastly more plausible than the typical SF novel. Rewrite the book to remove most of the first half - and it would have been 5 stars for me.",1315590640

2979067,comment,2977914,2978740,1,0,blauwbilgorgel,,,"I think time plays a large part, yes. I also think it is a left-right brain divide between maths and creativity.<p>I think people want to be good at what they do. The best designers can either ""waste time"" on becoming novice programmers, or they can perfect their core craft. If they spread too thin, they might soon stop becoming the best.<p>I guess it also depends on the role you play in a company or start-up. If you can help out other teams and communicate, that is very useful for a start-up or small business, but not something I think is appreciated in some larger companies: You get judged and hired on one core role and are expected to do that very well. If a big company needs design, they likely hire a full-time designer, not ask that DBA with a keen eye.<p>I am sure there are a few hack-of-all-trades that mastered full webstack programming, data analysis, community management, marketing, SEO, usability, copy-writing, design etc.. But I also feel it is unrealistic to expect one to be able to switch to the other, regardless of their individual talents and expertise.",1315590580

We found out that if the user does not use the service within the first two weeks, he is not very likely to use it in week 3 or 4 as well. When we've split-tested sign-ups we did not find a significant difference. But the conversion rate tester -> paying customer increased. We're at a 3:1 rate now (B2B, pricing starts at 19.90, open end), no free plan offered.<p>The trial period is accompanied by a follow-up email sequence (day 0, 1, 3, 7, 11, 14 after sign-up) to ask how's it all going and it includes a lot of supporting material (tips, videos, links to support pages, offer to schedule a call or screen sharing session) to get interacting with them and to make sure they really ask if there are questions.<p>The user can unsubscribe from this sequence (unsubscribe link in every email), but nobody really ever does. We get the occasional (maybe 1 out of 1000 testers or less) complaint about how annoying the follow up sequence is. We just remove those from the list. I remember 1 guy who was really annoyed but became a user anyway :-) 
So usually the testers really appreciate this information because they get the feeling there's someone who cares.<p>In all the follow up emails we make it clear that it would be easy to extend the trial period, a short email asking about it would be enough. We had one guy in a trial period for over 160 days. He wanted to use our product but his project did not take off as fast as expected and we just kept waiting (no follow ups).

This means that from an internal product development point of view, telling your team that your product should be ready by Q3 of next year will almost guarantee that the product will be done by Q3 or later (with copious amounts of scrambling as Q3 approaches). When you eliminate the deadline, workers (I would argue) are more likely to complete the task in the actual time it <i>SHOULD</i> take, instead of letting the job expand to fill the deadline. (You could argue that instead workers will be lazy and take longer than it should take, thus demonstrating that deadlines are necessary.)<p>You have the actual development time, and you have the artificial deadline. If the actual development time is longer than the deadline, then trying to meet the deadline will be stressful and quality to be sacrificed for speed. Alternatively if the deadline is longer than the actual time, then work will expand and the team will be less efficient. In both cases, working without a deadline should prove the better outcome.",1315590154

However, it will be hard to find why ... As of now, this policy will work because balsamiq is cool and hot. But after your company is not a startup anymore ('running repeatable business mode') you need to find something which will be more predictable. If nothing you might want to recruit a more senior people which do have a family. And then you will get into this ""it is hard to find talent"" bs.<p>Also if this is really a policy, why not to accrue minimum vacations anyway?",1315589435

However, the comparison with Java breaks down. I am sure the Java designers could have cleanly added lambdas in a very short period of time, and all other kinds of exciting features, if they abandoned backwards compatibility. There is a huge difference between modifying an app and a language in use by millions of programmers.<p>There is an interesting discussion to be had an apps become a ""nightmarish mish-mash"", and on languages becoming parallelised by backwards compatibility, but I am not sure they are as directly comparable as you wish.

If you work in vim day in and day out for a year (with a little curiosity and exploration) you should have most of this cheat sheet committed to muscle memory and move on to formulating more complex macros and using more advanced vim plugins to their potential.<p>I agree that emacs is more elegant in its implementation, but then again I think the very foundation of building an editor in lisp creates a level of elegance that is almost impossible to reach by any other path.  In other words, vim is less elegant, but I don't think it's <i>bad</i>.<p>Fundamentally I see vim/emacs as unequaled peers.  Vim is optimized for raw text editing potential, and emacs is optimized for customizability.  Vim is still richly extensible, and emacs is still powerful for raw editing out of the box, but they lose out to each other on their respective strengths.  I think the vim expert will be more effective editing disparate files on vanilla systems, and the emacs user will be more effective customizing his environment for his particular workflows.",1315587854

At the same time, when you look at Japan everything just looks better -- even though it isn't. So while I think much of it is convergent evolution or things that come from different sources, just having Japan being the way it is vaguely over there seems to be giving US leaders more self confidence to make these sorts of reforms.<p>Part of it also though is that Japan has a history of taking ideas from other cultures and then perfecting them. E.g. germany invents scientific management, Henry Ford popularizes and commercializes it, and then 60 years later it's getting shipped back to us as TQM and Kanban. So yeah it's definitely all tangled up, all I'm saying is that we're becoming more like Japan currently is, regardless of why we're becoming that way or why Japan is that way.",1315587789

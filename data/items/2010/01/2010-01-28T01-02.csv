Starts the process of strengthening the muscles and, importantly, the ligaments around the ankle and in the foot.<p>Toe-stepping should be maintained thereafter, too. It always surprises me that there are people who do barefoot running but revert to heel-stepping when walking. On the other extreme, some people do not put their heels down when standing still, which should also be avoided. Move on the toes, rest on the heel.",1264643999

In some cases you could force the relevant data streams into GA but you're working against the system and yourself from the very start - gaforflash is not the same as ga for flash games, which doesn't really exist and has no community of developers to help you figure it out.<p>Google Analytics is fantastic at what it's designed to do, which is track a site and with gaforflash pieces of Flash on a site.  There are a few key reasons why that's not a good match for casual games:<p>1) GA is from the ground up designed to presume the people are coming to you, and it's the opposite with the casual game business, our games go to 100s or 1000s of different websites.  Straight away you lose a lot of the functionality that makes GA great because it just isn't applicable / usable.<p>2) Events don't transfer directly to the structure of games, in general as a concept they do and especially compared to our custom events, but when you start digging into per-level and tracking multiple streams of data and multiple values on those streams it becomes complicated and difficult to interpret the results and even to figure out just how you're actually able to track these things.<p>To put it in perspective, if I quit on level 1 is the category quit and the action level 1, or vice versa, or both?  If I collected 30% of the coins then the problem gets bigger - category level 1, action collected, value 30%?  Or category collected, action level 1, value 30%, or category collected 30%, action level, value 1?  These are all the right answer, together, but now you're tripling the requests you're sending back to Google and creating so many events that you start jeopardizing the ability to interpret what's going on.<p>The other issue with the complexity of GA is most of the time you only get one chance at getting this stuff right - and there's a lot you need to get right otherwise the data's useless - because after your game's being distributed you can't easily push changes out to all the sites your game will be on.<p>3) The gaforflash api is heavy - 160 kilobytes - which is an expensive addition in terms of filesize and especially performance, both of which are critical in casual games where we might already be cramming a ton of work into a 30-times-a-second loop that already doesn't run well on whatever office/college/school computer the player's using.",1264643353

Honestly, I think that's because they think it's too hard.  Microsoft and Apple have been trying for decades at this point to make a computer that's open, easy to use for everyone, never crashes, etc.  The open source community has been trying too.  I don't see anyone as having succeeded there.  It's not for lacking of wanting to succeed, or for a lack of trying, it's just a <i>really hard</i> problem, and by locking things down they can create things that work much more predictably and reliably.<p>I don't think the OLPC is a counter-example; it solves some issues in virtue of having a standardized hardware platform, and they've tried to do away with the file system (which sort of works and sort of doesn't), but I don't think they've completely solved all the other problems around versioning and installation and removal and viruses and third-party devices that need their own drivers, etc.  I don't know a ton about it, so it's entirely possible there's something else innovative there that I'm missing.  I also would argue that they haven't done it in a device that an average consumer would really want.  They done all sorts of innovative things that I think are great, but I don't think they've solved those fundamental issues in a general way.<p>As for the moral obligation standpoint . . . I haven't read Zittrain's book, so I can't fully debate that argument.  From my perspective, roughly, you have a moral obligation not to do X if doing X infringes on someone else's rights without their consent.  So to say it's unethical to create a device like the iPad you'd have to argue that people who don't buy the iPad are directly harmed by it somehow, and that just seems like a tough argument to make.  I think the effect of something like the iPad on the future of computers, the internet, society as a whole, etc. is so hard to predict that I don't think you can fairly say that someone or some company has a moral obligation one way or the other.  Maybe those devices will open up computing to people that currently couldn't use those devices, making their lives better.  Maybe it will enable doctors to carry around a tablet that helps them avoid mistakes, saving lives.  Maybe it will help small-time developers make more money selling their software.  Or maybe it will kill innovation and put us at the mercy of an increasingly-paranoid government and law-enforcement community or put our information and privacy firmly in the hands of large corporations.  It's so hard to say which way things will go that I just don't think you can say it's unethical.",1264642796

It's all well and good to set a single price for <i>physical</i> goods, where marginal costs are nonzero, but the fact is, it costs nothing to distribute one more copy of a digital good, so any time a consumer is willing to pay even a single penny for a song/album/movie/etc. but can't do so because the producer's price is too high, the producer loses.<p>I don't have anything useful to say on the morality of any of this, because piracy is not going away no matter what anyone does - it's clearly ""wrong"", but the important question is what we should do about it, and I have yet to see any practical solutions other than accepting it as a cost of business and trying to maximize revenues anyways.  DRM schemes are fine in theory, and I'd have no problem if a good one came around, but in practice they have all really sucked because they punish legit consumers with all sorts of annoyances, and they <i>still</i> end up getting cracked, so pirates continue to pirate.  DRM is by definition an impossible technical problem to solve, so we can't expect it to be a silver bullet.<p>I've yet to see any mass exodus from any of the artistic fields that are affected by piracy, so can't believe that it's is killing anything, or that it will in the future.  If I had to guess, more than anything else it's increasing the number of people that obtain a product, most of whom would never have bothered to buy it in the first place.  At worst it's a few percentage point hit to the industries, but IMO those percentage points could be more than reclaimed by adopting a more creative pricing structure (I realize this is not something an individual artist could do, as it would require a lot of data to predict what someone would be willing to pay).<p>Beyond any of this, I don't think the small guys are hurting at all due to piracy, as they never had any sales to speak of to begin with.  Taking music as an example (I've both been a musician and worked at a record company), before the Internet, things looked almost exactly as they did now: big musicians made a lot of money off of albums and selling their fame in other ways, whereas small musicians had trouble making rent and made most of their money from gigs and lessons.  The only difference these days is that small musicians can actually sell a little bit of their music on the net to people that aren't physically at their shows - back when I was playing, a band without a major record deal was lucky if it sold any CDs at all, and worse, they had to pay for large numbers of them to get pressed up front.  I knew very few, if any, unsigned artists that were able to recoup even the <i>physical</i> production costs of their CDs pre-2000, so I'd say things are slightly better for the small guy now, if anything.",1264641861

Heel striking in racing flats is very awkward, and I certainly wouldn't consider it easier.<p>I definitely agree that moving away from heel striking can be very difficult after many years of doing it. I've slowly worked my way down from bulky trainers to lightweight trainers to minimal flats, and my achilles tendons gave me hell throughout the entire process.",1264640820

What is the caloric output during play of the typical NFL player? How does that relate to how much money they make and how does that compare to other sports, say basketball or hockey? I'd love to find some stats on this kind of thing mostly just so I could be more sick of football :)<p>I understand they make so much because the public 'demands' and they 'supply' but it seems almost grotesque how much some of them make and how little they apparently do.",1264640761

I'm just not sure why Apple isn't marketing it as one and selling a package that includes the dock and keyboard and maybe even speakers. It's a PC but one that you can easily take with you, turn on quickly, and do stuff on the go. In a weird way, the history of the Tablet seems to have them responding that it's not a Tablet PC. But I see no reason, practically, why it couldn't be exactly that.<p>Otherwise, I agree with you completely. And looking at their 8% market share of PCs, there's a lot of room for them to improve in that category and do very, very well. They've already shown that simplicity sells.",1264640746

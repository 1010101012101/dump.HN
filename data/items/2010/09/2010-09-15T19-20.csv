Simply saying what you think is treated as a ""masculine"" trait.  I imagine the ways of communicating that are treated as appropriately ""feminine"" are much less effective in a technical context.<p>Do you consciously model ways to give criticism that your female coworkers will feel comfortable with?  Does it help them open up and criticize each other?  What works?  (This is a subject I have an interest in in a personal context as well, since I sometimes get baffled and frustrated by indirect communication and would like to be better at coaxing women to be more direct, which is hard if the relationship isn't already close.)<p>Also, I'm surprised that women have a hard time taking criticism.

While no man wants to limit his options in women, being in a relationship probably doesn't define his sense of self-worth the way it does with women. Of course, not all women are this way, but women often sacrifice bits of themselves in the name of love. We are more likely to:<p>1. Give up time with our friends/hobbies to be completely there for a boyfriend, all the time.<p>2. Move to a new city to be with a guy (who sometimes isn't even planning to marry us), giving up any career progress made to date.<p>And that's even before adding a layer of geekiness that I've found acts as man repellent to most ""mainstream"" male populations.

I have tried to work on stuff on the side but it always fizzles out after a short while and I lose all motivation to work on it. The main problem is that there are no people around me who are in a similar situation / think like I do: which kind of make it even more difficult!<p>I was thinking of just taking a month or so off and just relaxing and starting on a project. Not sure if it'll work but I know that just whining and not doing anything about it  isn't going to get me anywhere. Just keep working at it and something will work out. If I try, I risk failure, if I don't, I ensure it!<p>Feel free to get in touch with me (email in profile) if you want to discuss more.",1284577292

Mostly, I go to Google and search for  ""$cityName restaurants"" or ""$restaurantName menu"". This is where you want your website to rank, and this is what is going to bring you tons of free traffic.<p>I went through your website, and figured that search engines can not crawl 99% of your website's content.<p>Your website has a nice idea, product and content; but inefficient design in terms of SEO. I see that with a lot of startups. SEO is not something that you can just get it done from a consultant at a later stage. It has to be built right in to the product, your product/website should have a Search Engine friendly structure and design.<p>I have years of experience building SEO friendly websites and web applications.

Raising investment for your company is not the same as having a business model dependent upon acquisition/exit strategy.<p>Remember ever investor dreams of getting stock in the next Google - the one piece of their portfolio that will make up for all the other losses combined.  A big hit of nature will come either from a massive acquisition (like YouTube - but just how many acquisitions have there been on that scale?  The media hypes these up a lot but that distorts the actual perception of the regularity with which they occur) or from running a sustainable business e.g. Facebook that can grow by itself.",1173135506

I've seen what happens when a company tries to gamble on getting bigger and fails (investment bankers are not nice).<p>With VCs you trade time (to find them) and control in exchange for money and contacts.

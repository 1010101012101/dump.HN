  of substandard programmers use it, to the point where it's much much 
  easier to generate total and utter crap with it. Quite frankly, even if 
  the choice of C were to do *nothing* but keep the C++ programmers out, 
  that in itself would be a huge reason to use C.

Android has the concept of 'bundles' and 'servers'. Bundles work similarly to what Apple is doing, but having servers (which multi-task in a more traditional model) enables more consistent background processing.<p>For instance, an alarm clock on Android is often implemented with the GUI 'bundle' on the front-end and a server on the back-end that manages the actual 'when should I sound the alarm?' part of the task.'<p>That's one thing that just isn't possible in the iPhone model.",1270870103

Memorization is not an end in itself, and it does not constitute learning. But when you use this information, you won't forget it. Every field requires memorization, and most fields -- biology, history, physics, political science, languages -- require far more. We are only able to solve problems if we are familiar with the necessary terms and laws. To improve your memory, don't trust your recognition memory when it comes to a test. Practice writing out the definitions and theorems, and make outlines of the major points of the theory. Check back to your text for accuracy. It is easy to think we know something until we attempt to put it in writing. By practicing studying continuously in this way, rather than cramming at the last minute, you will find memorization will feel more naturally like part of the learning process.""<p>Anyway, can't learning the content of the preliminary course mentioned in the submitted article be fun for someone who recognizes beautiful consistent patterns for the first time?",1270869881

Because of this, old drills like &quot;duck and cover&quot; were foolishness at best and cold-blooded ways to placate the populace at worse.<p>Fact: the area of total destruction is fairly small. Most injuries and deaths by most bombs would be caused by flying debris. Duck and cover is a great way to increase people&#x27;s chances of survival. If you&#x27;re right at ground zero then you&#x27;re still screwed, but there are potentially millions of people living at distances where structures would overall survive but taking cover would greatly help their chances of survival. I blame this on pictures of Hiroshima from after the bombing there, where nearly everything is just wiped clean. People don&#x27;t realize that this is because most of the buildings in the city were practically built out of paper.<p>Common myth: following a nuclear explosion, the area will be too contaminated to live in for centuries or millennia.<p>Fact: the really nasty stuff decays in days or weeks. It may not be the healthiest place to be long-term, but months or years after the event, it&#x27;s not generally going to be a big deal. Witness the distinct lack of widespread contamination and abandonment in modern-day Hiroshima and Nagasaki for example.<p>Common myth: a full-scale nuclear war would destroy all life on the planet. OK, all complex life. Well, all human life.<p>Fact: while it would be an event without precedent in both its size and speed, lots of people would still survive. It would pretty thoroughly wreck civilization and easily kill hundreds of millions or even billions of people, but life would, overall, go on. Many countries would escape the devastation and, while their economics would have extreme trouble due to the devastation of global trade, they would not revert to a pre-industrial state or anything like it. Expect a future with technological advances slowed down greatly and dominated by Brazil, sub-Saharan Africa, and possibly Australia, not a future filled with radioactive wastelands and handfuls of survivors waiting for death in underground bunkers.<p>Common myth: the electromagnetic pulse from a nuclear explosion will wipe out electronics in the region.<p>Fact: most nuclear explosions don&#x27;t produce EMP. You only get it when they&#x27;re set off in the upper atmosphere, as the EMP comes from the interaction of gamma rays with sparse gasses and the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. An attacker with the capability would be wise to set such a thing off over the US, but, for example, a terrorist nuke in New Jersey isn&#x27;t going to wipe the computers on Wall Street.<p>Common myth: despite all of the above misconceptions, nuclear weapons are still tremendously frightening and we&#x27;re all extremely lucky that the Cold War never went hot.<p>Fact: no, this one is definitely right.",1386532512

6871060,comment,6869897,6870651,12,0,eyeguy,,,"In this case, that is not true at all.  I worked for a large retina group for 6 years and now consult for several different retina and general ophthalmology practices, so I&#x27;m a little biased, but I&#x27;ve also been lucky enough to see these new drugs through various stages.\nFirst of all, Doctors are the ones buying the drug, and they have to keep enough inventory on hand to treat the patients that need it until the next delivery day.  The introduction of these higher priced biologics has had a huge affect on the way practices (especially smaller ones) have to manage their inventory. The last practice I worked for was buying between $1.2 and $1.8 millon worth of lucentis, a few hundred grand worth of Eyelea and a boatload Avastin every month.  If anything goes wrong during the reimbursement process and the practice isn&#x27;t paid as expected, it can be devastating.  When the use of these drugs started ramping up, there were definitely a few scary payroll periods for us.  Putting the right inventory management procedures in place significantly helps this problem, but there&#x27;s definitely some stress knowing you&#x27;re on the hook for over 2mil each month.  \nGenentech&#x27;s rebate and Regeneron&#x27;s extended payment terms are efforts to alleviate some of this stress on providers while ensuring they are keeping enough stock on hand that they aren&#x27;t having to bring patients back for a follow up visits just to order the drug.  (some practices will see a patient, diagnosis, reschedule for follow up injection, then order the drug. This just wastes everyone&#x27;s time)\nEven more importantly though, as said elsewhere in the comments, these drugs are definitely not the same.  A lot of us, even the docs, in the industry joked about the high price of Lucentis when it first came out and many doctors (though I&#x27;m not sure on the exact number, but I think I remember hearing 80% of anti-vegF injections were Avastin not lucentis) used avastin over lucentis specifically because of the price.\nIn the past few years however, this thinking has changed and it has very little to do with the reimbursement model.  In the beginning, these drugs were simply awe inspiring.  Before the availability of these drugs, a retina doc&#x27;s approach to AMD was, &quot;here&#x27;s an amsler grid.. let me know if anything changes (it will), we&#x27;ll see  you in 6 months to asses how much more blind you&#x27;ve become.  There are some vitamins you can take that might slow things down (barely), and oh yeah, there is this cold laser treatment we can try(PDT)that will just shut down that area and maybe prevent the spread. That treatment is going to require us to infuse you with a drug for 15 min, then shoot a laser in your eye for 83 seconds.. oh then after that, we are going to wrap you like a mummy because any form of UV is going to burn the shit out of you.. fun stuf&quot; \n Now all of a sudden here is a drug (Avastin) that takes half a second to inject, and not only preserves the vision that you have, but if we catch the leakage early, it can even dry it up and improve your vision! I was fortunate enough to work on some of the early trials and honestly the follow up visits were just breathtaking.  NVAMD used to be a death sentence to vision.. now it&#x27;s merely an inconvenience that can be overcome.\nWith that success came Lucentis (Avastin was being used totally off label) an FDA approved drug that was crazy expensive. Patient&#x27;s couldn&#x27;t afford it, no one really used it.  Then medicare and some other insurances started having issues with off-label use and it actually  became easier to get reimbursed for using Lucentis.  The CATT trial started and some issues started being raised over whether or not Avastin was actually safe long term. Then there was the scare in Florida were a batch of Avastin from a compound pharmacy was contaminated and a ton of patients lost their sight to infections.  So we started using Lucentis a little more frequently, just to see.  While the Catt trial shows the two drugs are pretty equivalent.. in everyday practice, it&#x27;s becoming more apparent that this is not the case. Some forms of AMD respond better to lucentis than Avastin. Diabetics with Macular Edema sometimes respond quicker to Lucentis (and even faster with Eylea!) It becomes more about finding the right drug for the individual patient than just choosing the cheapest option.  Most doctors are not trying to screw their patients over, and have protocols in place for finding the best possible drug, and, in my experience at least, most of these protocols do consider the affordability to the patient as well as the effectiveness. (Personally, I think there are genetic variants of these diseases that determine the effectiveness of the drug, we just don&#x27;t fully understand yet.. once we can more accurately test these variants and build trials around them, this will become more of a non-issue)\nA few years ago, I would have totally agreed with this article, not anymore.  The sad truth is profit drives innovation, it&#x27;s a bitch developing new drugs, and their has to be enough of an incentive both financially and medically to encourage progress in that field. At the end of the day, the majority of the doctors out there just want was is going to be best for their patients and are continually re-evaluating their strategies to ensure that goal is met.",1386532192

Years ago people renting from a private landlord had limits imposed about the size of property they could rent - they were not allowed to be over accommodated.

Recently this rule has been applied to people renting from the public sector - local council housing and housing association properties.<p>In theory it creates liquidity in the property market, and makes sure people are in the right size homes and getting the right amount of benefit.

The moral ideal is Socialism and yet where ever it is tried consistently it fails. Our moral evil is Capitalism and yet where ever it is tried it leads to material success but moral decay. So the dilemma of our age is a moral-practical dichotomy that no one seems to be able to resolve.  It is understandable that people like Simon issue a call to double down on the moral ideal of Socialism, that&#x27;s what morality is for, to tell us what we should do.

By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some.

Who&#x27;s <i>we</i> anyway? Aren&#x27;t we all just individuals, with our own goals and desires that are constantly changing anyway?

Barack Obama, as a Senator, stated, &quot;The fact that we are here today to debate raising America&#x27;s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. Government can&#x27;t pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Government&#x27;s reckless fiscal policies... Increasing America&#x27;s debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that &#x27;the buck stops here.&#x27; Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren.

As a diesel mechanic I could go a lot of places (urban areas were generally out; I would need to live in the suburbs, where there were truck stops). A programmer, on the other hand, has the option to freelance, work from home, even start his own business with limited or no capital. Any company of any decent size probably hires programmers once and a while or even has a few on staff, but it&#x27;s not really that easy if your specialty is hyperbaric welding (which you can make a small fortune doing, to be fair). No one &quot;bootstraps&quot; a mechanic&#x27;s shop, too much space and specialized equipment.<p>But that&#x27;s still pretty flexible.

Now, Norway is a small country, with limited military involvements: The only areas we are active in are areas where the US is active too. They wanted us to believe that Norway has a foreign surveillance capability where we are able to collect that kind of call volume in places like Afghanistan, that <i>the NSA does not already have</i>.<p>If we do, that too should be news, and should have led to further reports and political questions raised. And it should have led to questions over how, then, the domestic intelligence couldn&#x27;t make do with far less money, as military intelligence apparently manages to do a massive amount of surveillance in war zones on what suddenly looks like a shoestring budget... But the press response was to parrot what military intelligence said.<p>They held a press conference - something they hardly ever do - and made what appeared to be revelations about operational ability - something they never do - and courted media all day.<p>Meanwhile, the Police Security Service, which in the past have been caught red-handed carrying out substantial illegal surveillance, kept extremely low profile despite the fact that the allegations made by the newspapers (and reiterated in a piece by Greenwald) was that this was about surveillance <i>in Norway</i> which means it is the Police Security Service&#x27;s &quot;table&quot;. <i>They</i> were able to get away with a denial through a press contact and were then out of the news picture with no further questioning.<p>Apparently not a <i>single</i> news source saw it as odd enough to question why military intelligence was all over the news and why they might want to push for further responses from the people <i>actually</i> responsible for surveillance in Norway. The people who (under their previous name - the Police Surveillance Service) not only spend decades carrying illegally political surveillance of the Norwegian left, but were even caught carrying out illegal surveillance of the member of parliament who led the parliamentary commission investigating their illegal surveillance <i>while he was investigating them</i>.<p>The press did not apply any pressure at all. Not publicly at least. They just immediately accepted the claims from military intelligence. Dagbladet folded immediately and backtracked. And the major papers subjected their online forums to the harshest moderation I&#x27;ve ever seen in Norwegian papers.<p>Frankly, no event in Norwegian politics in the last 30 years have scared me more than how that was treated: Whether or not Dagbladet&#x27;s claims were true or not, it demonstrated <i>either</i> a scary ability of the establishment to shut down any kind of real journalism around it, <i>or</i> a scary level of apathy and disinterest.

Right off the top, the Federal government accounts for 22.6%<p>We thankfully have a canonical example that exposes just how bad government can be:  Obamacare.<p>Government is the only organization on the planet that can take a website that could not possibly cost more than one to five million (as a ridiculous maximum) and turn it into a disaster costing upwards of a billion dollars.  Think about THAT for a moment.  It took government A BILLION DOLLARS just to make a website that the private sector could have delivered for A THOUSAND TIMES less money and in a third of the time.  And, of course, it would have worked as required on day one.<p>I am not going to propose government money utilization is a thousand times less efficient than in the private sector across all domains.  If I had to guess, based on my direct experience selling to various government agencies and seeing just how convoluted the process can become, I&#x27;d say the private sector is 50 to 100 times more efficient at everything.  The exception, of course, is killing people and spying on the population.<p>I&#x27;ll go with 100 times for easy numbers.  This means whatever government accomplished with 3.54 trillion could have been done privately for a mere 35 billion.  Even if I am off by a factor of ten this is still a major difference.<p>This means that this 22.6% participation is mostly money being burned.  The actual real impact of government is probably somewhere in the the 2% or less range.<p>To use the lovely Obamacare canonical government-incompetence-and-waste example.  Ask yourself this question:  What could we have done with a billion dollars if instead of letting government burn it to try to build a website we had given five million of that to a qualified private entity to build the site and devoted $995 billion to, say, medical research or other massively valuable causes?  Right.  They just burned money that could have funded the discovery of a cure for Cancer and who knows what else.<p>You have to consider this:<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Federal_Spending_-_FY_2011.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Federal_Spending_-_FY...</a><p>and then this:<p><a href=\"http://nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-1...</a><p>Hard to argue that the money is being spent with both discretion and intelligence.

In spite of the fact that plenty of other governments gave it a try too. Truth is, Lenin and even Stalin were pretty smart guys and they implemented communism the way it was meant to be . Actually, a guy predicted the Lenin/Stalin way would be the end-result for any communism implementation. The guy who predicted was an anarchist so not particularly right wing:<p>&quot;First, then, State Socialism, which may be described as the doctrine that all the affairs of men should be managed by the government, regardless of individual choice. Marx, its founder, concluded that the only way to abolish the class monopolies was to centralize and consolidate all industrial and commercial interests, all productive and distributive agencies, in one vast monopoly in the hands of the State. The government must become banker, manufacturer, farmer, carrier, and merchant, and in these capacities must suffer no competition. Land, tools, and all instruments of production must be wrested from individual hands, and made the property of the collectivity. To the individual can belong only the products to be consumed, not the means of producing them. A man may own his clothes and his food, but not the sewing-machine which makes his shirts or the spade which digs his potatoes. Product and capital are essentially different things; the former belongs to individuals, the latter to society. Society must seize the capital which belongs to it, by the ballot if it can, by revolution if it must. Once in possession of it, it must administer it on the majority principle, though its organ, the State, utilize it in production and distribution, fix all prices by the amount of labor involved, and employ the whole people in its workshops, farms, stores, etc. The nation must be transformed into a vast bureaucracy, and every individual into a State official. Everything must be done on the cost principle, the people having no motive to make a profit out of themselves. Individuals not being allowed to own capital, no one can employ another, or even himself. Every man will be a wage-receiver, and the State the only wage-payer. He who will not work for the State must starve, or, more likely, go to prison. All freedom of trade must disappear. Competition must be utterly wiped out. All industrial and commercial activity must be centered in one vast, enormous, all-inclusive monopoly. The remedy for monopolies is monopoly. Such is the economic programme of State Socialism as adopted from Karl Marx.&quot;<p>Benjamin Tucker, State Socialism and Anarchism: How Far They Agree, and Wherin They Differ (1888)<p>Sounds familiar?<p>Second point, the labor theories of value described in the Capital you enjoyed so much has been proven wrong.

Economists also believe in Labor and Capital, they are the variables L and C in macro models.

Here&#x27;s an excerpt:<p><i>&quot;How many people actually use any of this “practical math” they supposedly learn in school? Do you think carpenters are out there using trigonometry? How many adults remember how to divide fractions, or solve a quadratic equation? Obviously the current practical training program isn’t working, and for good reason: it is excruciatingly boring, and nobody ever uses it anyway. So why do people think it’s so important? I don’t see how it’s doing society any good to have its members walking around with vague memories of algebraic formulas and geometric diagrams, and clear memories of hating them. It might do some good, though, to show them something beautiful and give them an opportunity to enjoy being\ncreative, flexible, open-minded thinkers— the kind of thing a real mathematical education might provide.&quot;</i><p>For some reason, the math curriculum is completely about learning <i>techniques</i>, which roughly correspond to formulaic manipulation of symbols. We basically learn to apply algorithms for manipulating symbols, and we do it over and over again. And of course, this is easy to test.<p>But it&#x27;s also the absolute least important aspect we need to know! It&#x27;s the part that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> involve thinking. And so we end up with some farce of an education where we learn the procedures without the context why people created them in the first place!<p>Take the quadratic formula: something wholly useless in real life, but taught to every middle-schooler in the US. Somehow, even though the name has &quot;quad&quot; in it, we learn it without learning the context of the ancient Greek concept of <i>quadrature</i>, and problems relating to whether it is possible to find a rectangle with a certain area and perimeter. In the derivation, we &quot;complete the square&quot;, but nobody draws the said square!<p>And then we do a hundred problems involving applying the quadratic formula, which is neither enlightening nor useful.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/devlin/LockhartsL...</a>",1386529875

We&#x27;ve now equated avoidance of hospitality taxes on a legal and moral scale with facilitating prostitution.  I&#x27;m <i>all</i> for the rule of law, but these days that means keeping as close an eye on the law itself as for potential lawbreakers.<p>Your big hammer, of course, completely dodges the nuance that grellas was getting to.  Laws are created and implemented in a context. What we&#x27;be seen in recent decades with the MP3 revolution, Uber, YouTube, and ostensibly services like AirBnB are business models that are matched poorly to existing law and precedent.  That is, the context has changed.  Neither extreme -- throwing out The Law entirely, nor draconian implmentation of The Law -- is really a suitable response in most cases.  I think Uber is a particularly relevant example, as it&#x27;s been thrust directly into the midst of innovating in an existing class of business, occasionally at odds with local laws, regulations, and incumbent businesses.<p>To this situation, AirBnB has put forth its case that it facilitates uptake of temporarily vacant lodgings.  There are good arguments as to the social benefit this provides.  Imagine where AirBnB and similar services are so successful that they curb construction of dedicated hotel space. As a society we&#x27;ve then managed to curb unnecessary resource use. I would argue that truly occasional use of the service in this regard has little to no impact on the associated community.<p>However, I also agree with your comments about transient lodging and its impacts on communities.  There&#x27;ve been a few good essays on this problem in the NYC area in recent years, but from the angle of <i>transient owners</i>.  IMO, The Man Who Doesn&#x27;t Exist falls clearly into the category of &quot;transient facilitator&quot;.  There&#x27;s not even the ostensible intent to live in these properties, damn the excess, but just to use them as part of a business strategy.  And there&#x27;s our nuance.  <i>Some</i> users of AirBnB are engaging in activity that steps over the line.  But the law currently doesn&#x27;t have any nuance to distinguish between AirBnB&#x27;s stated business model and the occasional &quot;transient facilitator&quot; using the service.<p>And thus the earthquakes at the fault line between law and society&#x27;s shifts rolls on.",1386529874

There are a lot of startups where the glamor of the industry means that they can easily pressure 20 something fresh out of school folks who are probably also suffering from imposter syndrome that the only way to learn is to work insane amounts of hours. I have no problems with working hard on improving yourself but a work life balance and doing productive work are not the same as that. I still remember one startup where one of the co-founders took pride in telling me that a guy in his team spent 30 days sleeping at work. Fuck that noise. As a person more experienced, you are probably well aware of that balance. However, as a junior developer, you are probably not as productive as someone else your age.<p>2. Money.

6870839,comment,6870399,6870734,3,0,Piromancer,,,"In a conventional keyboard, the point at which the switch closes is also the point where the key bottoms out, plus or minus the amount of give that the rubber spring-membrane provides. The typing feel they provide is both impactful and gummy - you push a key until it stops abruptly, like mashing a finger down on your desk directly, and then you have to lift your finger off the key entirely to let it release. Trying to lighten the impacts can lead to missing keypresses, especially on an older keyboard.<p>On a mechanical keyboard (mine has Cherry MX Browns), the point at which the switches close is before the key bottoms out. Depending on the switch type, the closing point can be felt, too. They&#x27;re also driven back by mechanical springs, rather than a rubber membrane. So, rather than mash the keys until they stop to guarantee a letter press, the typing feel is lighter and more controlled. It&#x27;s also much bouncier, thanks to the springs - like bouncing on a trampoline, rather than trying to jump on a hard floor.<p>I went from old-school gummy keyboards (Yay ancient Dell hardware) to laptop-style scissors keyboards, and when my last one died, I splurged and got a mechanical keyboard instead. It&#x27;s similar to a laptop-style keyboard feel, where there is a very definite point of engagement rather than tons of mush. However, the throw is still long, and the bounce-back is a new experience.<p>It&#x27;s all about feel - definitely look around and see if you can borrow one (or multiple - there are a half-dozen different flavors of mechanical switch from Cherry alone) to try before spending the not-insignificant amount of money to buy one.",1386529523

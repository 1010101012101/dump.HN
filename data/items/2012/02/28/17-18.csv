The obvious being that you start making money now rather than waiting for capital growth. The second, less obvious, is that some investors hold the rule that you don't buy stocks that don't pay dividends. If Apple started to pay dividends it would open doors to even more investors. I would assume this would help their stock rise at an even faster rate.<p>I would still buy Apple stock if I had the cash on hand.

The real world responds to the 'actual computing time of the traveling salesman + the traveling time' problem, i.e., if your exact solution is 10% better than the approximate solution but your computation time is 20 times longer so that the salesman can't even start actually traveling ;-) your best solution becomes suddenly your second best (plus many variations of it).<p>Of course in general there might be no way to know how much better you could do with the exact solution, but unless there is a Maxwell's devil choosing the set of your towns and roads, it's usually possible to estimate what the average error is (also in terms of some few computed cases and using Monte Carlo techniques). It won't give you the 100% certainty, but it'll give you the certainty that your solution is gonna be not that bad, given how quickly you get it.<p>I would suggest another thing. When you have a problem that you know it's hard to deal with, give it to a very intelligent person in your team that doesn't know it's very hard to treat. Most likely they will be more creative than you can, because they don't have that sense of hopeless you get when you know that a problem has no exact and easy solution ;-)<p>I'd say the real world problems are similar to the difference from math and physics according to one of my professors when I was a student. He'd say that when mathematicians and physicists try to approach a problem, their way of trying to find a solution is comparable to two guys approaching a cliff. The mathematician tries to carefully look at every rock and goes down to the ocean very very slowly, the physicist just jumps in an awkward way, kinda scared, screaming and closing their eyes and hoping they won't hit any rocks and that it won't end too bad (they aren't really risking their lives anyhow).<p>If what you need is a real world solution, you can just jump and see how it goes, you most likely won't die for that (because you are also probably not actually jumping off a cliff).",1330451405

I think it's bullshit; I think it's bad for the employers, who get substandard burnout work and become a revolving door that spins even faster for more talented team members; I think it's bad for employees for obvious reasons.<p>But I also think (a) a slice of cheese shouldn't cost $200 and have an end-user licensing agreement attached, and (b) we don't need to outlaw that practice.<p>When you read articles about unfair labor practices at tech companies, I'd like you to keep in mind that software developers are <i>the</i>. <i>worst</i>. at reasoning about the valuation of their own work.

I suppose that is successful in the sense that the founders get rich, but it seems like it's a selfish, thoughtless strategy.<p>The idea of a lifestyle company is totally unattractive to venture capitalists to the point where you'd think that only total losers would aspire to create a stable company.  If it's not a rocketship to the moon, then investors don't want to touch it.  But a lifestyle company founder can get equally rich - just not one huge pile of money at one time.

3643929,comment,3642106,3642106,7,0,spinlock,,,"Here's my problem with people who put in 80 hours a week: they don't write good code. At my first job - way back in the last millenium - we were creating a carrier class network device. I was hired to run the mail servers but ended up building an embedded linux that ran the PowerPC on our hardware - we also had a Strong ARM that ran a gig ethernet but that was under another guy. So, how did I go from mail server to an integral piece of the product? I took over for the guy who put a lot of time into not solving a problem. Before you can even get linux running on your hardware, you need a boot loader to initialize your hardware and get it into a state where linux will run. Our ""hard worker"" volunteered to write a boot loader and spent 60+ hours a week for the next 6 months writing it. But it never worked.<p>Management decided to let me take a crack at the boot loader. Now, I was in my early 20's. I had bars to drink at, a girlfriend to get some lovin' from, and parties to go to. I didn't want to spend 60 hours a week at my desk. So, I did what any lazy hacker would do: I found an open source project that was close to what we needed. The project I started from was PPCBoot and it was started by Wolfgang Denk for the purpose of booting hardware running a Power PC processor. I spent 2 weeks telling everyone else in the company that I needed their help on X, Y or Z; getting them to write some code; and burning the new version of PPCBoot onto the flash chip. After 2 40 hour weeks, something amazing happened: it worked. It configured the hardware and handed control to linux which booted up.<p>Anyway, that's my reason not to spend more than 40 hours at work in a week. All of the people who I've seen put in all those hours aren't really working. They're just playing with a neat project because they've always wanted to write a boot loader. The purpose of you job isn't to write code, it's to ship a product. If you keep that in the front of your mind at all times and focus your efforts on shipping product, you can ""work"" 40 hours a week and code a pet project on your own time.",1330449692

It teaches you simple techniques you can apply when you are stuck, like ""draw a picture"", ""think about a similar problem you already know the solution for"", and ""solve a relaxed version of your problem"".

Some background: I'm a Java guy by trade, this is my first FP language, and I'm not that well-versed in Javascript. In general, I've found the whole experience to be rather fun. A bit of a learning curve for sure, but once I ramped up I felt really productive. I don't feel like I get stuck as much as other times when I've tackled a new framework/language. And the nature of the language lends itself to just start writing functions rather than get caught up trying to abstract everything. I feel like my code flows better, is easier to refactor, debug, etc. Clojurescript may still be considered new/beta/cutting-edge, but I never found it to be buggy or frustrating to use.\nA few minor things I got hung up on:<p>goog.dom.query - This isn't included by default, I'm guessing because it's a third-party wrapper around dojo.query. I had to follow a few threads on Google Groups to figure out how to include it. Another option is to use Chris Granger's jayq. But there's no way to do CSS-type selector queries by default (that I know of).<p>Converting between Javascript objects and Clojure data structures - I had to scratch my head a bit the first few times I ran into this, but there are lots of code snippets on Stack Overflow and various other places around the web. I was able to quickly develop a few reusable idioms to handle this.<p>Lazy sequences and side-effects - people with more experience in FP might not have gotten stuck on this, but this was another head scratcher for me. Basically any type of DOM manipulation is a side-effect, so if you're app relies on that, you'll need to occasionally force evaluation of a lazy seq.<p>The browser-connected REPL takes a few manual steps, but it's well documented, and extremely useful. It's just not as easy as running ""lein repl"". The default compiler is not integrated with lein either, and is not automated, but lein cljsbuild is available as Kevin mentions. I ended up using Chris Granger's cljs-watch.<p>In any case, if you can't find it through Google, it takes all of about 15 secs to get your question answered on #clojure IRC.<p>My current setup includes VimClojure and a browser-connected REPL in my terminal. I'm using Noir on the backend, and the included Google Closure libraries on the front-end. I tried to minimize the number of additional dependencies (perhaps irrationally), so I opted out of using the remotes from fetch (formerly pinot), and just used goog.net.XhrIo calls to the noir backend to acheive a similar effect. I did find the crate library to be perfect for dynamically creating DOM objects. You can write something like [:form [<form body...>]] instead of ""<form> <form body...></form>"", and it's nicely highlighted with Clojure syntax.\nFor debugging, I just use Chrome's debugger. It's compiled JS, but it's easy to figure out where you're at. All of your functions are at the bottom of the script. You're not going to have a lot of state to track in the actual Javascript either, so most bugs are easily sniffed out, at least in my somewhat simple app.\nSorry for the long post.",1330449223

Not only we do this by allowing our teams or single devs creating portfolios (which is privileged information displayed only to interested employers) but also by asking them to show us the code or design they are most proud of.\n2- Have them come up with an overall plan for the project but commit to only the first sprint.  Creating the overall plan for any project will allow you to see how the dev thinks about solving the problem while paying only for the first sprint will limit your risk and allows you to see a bit of his work at the time.\n3- Limit the sprints to 1 week at most - and make sure at least a feature is developed in the sprint.  Short sprints will help you a- prevent cost overruns, b- cap your risk of working with a bad apple and c- allow you to see features developed early on.\n4- Try to manage the whole thing through github. Great programmers hate to add additional layers of estimation, communication, tracking, etc. yet you as a project owner need insight into the work.  Make sure you agree to some schedule of commits with the dev so that you get to see progress along the way.<p>Feel free to ping us at grouptalent.com if any additional questions. otherwise - happy building!",1330449205

The touchstone of trademark law is whether your branding will make customers think you're related to someone who was in the space before you. If you're confusing customers, you have a problem; if you're not, you don't.  Having an (R) makes it easier for the earlier entrant to prove infringement and collect damages, but it's not the end of the story.<p>(So for example in this case, when you say that the number of sites using the term Hacker News invalidates the trademark, what you mean is that no reasonable customer would think Paul Graham sponsors HNM, because the term Hacker News isn't associated with this site in particular.

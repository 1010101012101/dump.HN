There was a long-standing bug with the cart display in the upper right of the page always saying that the cart was empty.  People would report it all the time, and the quite smart lead programmer said it was something really complicated that he hadn't had time to investigate.<p>But eventually, after I sort of knew my way around the code, and when I finished up all the tasks on my to-do list, he handed me that as a why-not-investigate sort of thing.  He didn't really have any idea, just that the previous long-gone coder had said it was complicated and in the depths of the way the front end code interacted with the order system.<p>So, I reproduce it, and look at the template code.  These two lines, right next to each other:<p>[% cart_summ = ourdb.cart_summary %]\n[% IF cart_cumm.qty > 0 %]<p>Note that the two variables don't match.  And this was broken on the site for _FOUR YEARS_.  And nobody looked because someone said he had and it was hard, and nobody had time for a hard problem.<p><i>facepalm</i>",1255107461

So taken as a whole, the system can be seen to have failed almost instantly.<p>> <i>So in practice it may seem like an oligarchy</i><p>If we look at the actual functioning of government (by which I don't mean just the elected representatives), most officials and bureaucrats are not significantly affected by any one election. There is a <i>de facto</i> permanent government, and there are clear patterns in the selection and activity of these officials.<p>> <i>freedom of speech and democracy</i><p>The problem is that freedom/individualism is at odds with democracy. Most Western democracies do not have freedom of speech, again for democratic reasons. The US is an exception here, probably because of the prominent placement and unambiguous language of the First Amendment and the acceptance of freedom of speech as an American tradition.<p>> <i>The education system may be going the wrong way, but why is it because of democracy?</i><p>Because the education system is run and managed by the permanent govt. mentioned above. They admit to wanting increased schooling and increased control. (Universal govt. schooling was a democratic idea in the first place.) Notice they have also come up with ""scientific"" justifications for this.<p>> <i>China on the other hand, has a governing style based on oligarchical manipulation of the population.</i><p>So does the US. You can verify this by, for example, looking at the typical state-mandated school curriculum.<p>> <i>So in essence the Democratic method does not force the bad education system, while the Chinese method fundamentally will oppose freedom of education as it will eventually, if not already, conflict with the interests of the oligarchy.</i><p>Your description of China's method applies to the US as well. The democratic method does indeed force the bad education system; as I mentioned earlier, it is a democratic (small d) idea to have the government attempt to school everybody.<p><i>China...has a style of government that will definitely not allow the freedom of education you and I both love.</i><p>I agree, but again, this applies to the US as well.",1255106763

To any developer concerned that you'll be ostracized by a potential employer because you don't have an interest in programming outside of work, let me give you a piece of advice. Employers who think they can define your work ethic on the job based upon what you do as a hobby outside of work, are some of the worst people to work for in this industry. If you want to let your hobby be your work, then more power to you, but you are in the vast minority. To everyone else, take heart in knowing that just because a few managers feel this way, it doesn't make it some industry standard we must all follow like sheep. Programmers -- go home at night, and be home. Enjoy your family, your friends, other hobbies, recreational pursuits, the environment... do what you enjoy in life. More than likely you'll be the group of developers that actually brings new, fresh insights to the table, because you're not living in a box coding 24/7, but you're living in the real world.",1255106513

The result was that a tantalum capacitor was installed backwards on a 12V supply rail.<p>Tantalum capacitors are polarized, and they fail in a spectacular way when reverse-biased.  In this case, the supply rail could source upwards of 20A, so the fireworks were loud and impressive.  Luckily the cap was easily replaced and the only permanent damage was cosmetic.<p>Hardest-to-troubleshoot bug:<p>In my subsequent return to the world of software, I worked on device drivers for network interfaces (among other things).<p>NICs frequently operate through a circularly-linked list of packet descriptors, which contain pointers to buffers in RAM where the NIC can DMA packet data.  The hardware fills the DMA buffers and marks the descriptor as ""used,"" and the driver chases the NIC around the ring, processing the packet data and marking the descriptors as free.<p>In testing, we discovered that under long periods (hours, usually) of heavy load, the system would occasionally freak out and stop processing packets.  Sometime later, various software modules would crash.<p>Working backwards through the post-mortem data, I saw that the NIC would get ""lost"" and dump packet data all over system memory.  I dumped the descriptor ring (tens-of-thousands of entries) and wrote some scripts to check it for consistency.<p>To make a very long story short, when the NIC was stormed with lots of 64b packets with no gaps, it would eventually screw up a DMA transfer and corrupt the ""next"" pointer in the descriptor ring.  On the subsequent trip through the ring, the NIC would chase an errant pointer off into system memory and corrupt other system data structures.<p>Since hardware can DMA anywhere in RAM, the OS is powerless to stop it.  The resulting errors can be ridiculously hard to track down and fix.",1255104752

871678,comment,870484,870484,0,0,IsaacL,,,"Try googling 'interactive fiction', which seems to be the modern term for old-school text-games. I used to play a few text games as a teenager (I'm 20 now, so this was only a few years ago) and there seemed to be a small but thriving community about IF. A lot of intelligent discussion about narrative, game design, and so on.<p>When you talk about the 'text-based games where you rob a bank, etc', it sounds like you are referring to Torn, the browser game that was posted on HN a few days ago for making its creator a millionaire. There's quite a fundamental difference IMO between clicking buttons on a webpage and entering pseudo-english sentences at a CLI.<p>I feel I can speak with a bit more authority on the first kind as over the last few months I've been working on my own browser game, which currently has around 600 active users (active = logged on in the last 5 days). It's not purely text-based, as the main screen includes a 2d map showing the area around a player. Still, a few people have said it reminds them of the old Infocom games, which I think is pretty cool.<p>If you want to take a look, the game is called Shintolin (<a href=""http://www.shintolin.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shintolin.co.uk</a>) and is set in the stone age; players craft spears, build huts, hunt animals and so on. One of the features is that every item and building in the game is player constructed - there are no NPCs apart from animals, and the game's history arises naturally from the interactions between the different villages.<p>Sadly it hasn't made me a millionaire, but I have learned a lot about programming from it, especially how to organise large projects (I had to scrap the original version of the site, after it became an unmaintainable mess of PHP scripts). There's no Javascript or Flash involved, just plain HTML/CSS, with a Ruby and MySQL backend.<p>Anyway, I mention that just to show you that the space of possible text-based games is quite large and diverse, so you might want to look around to see what tickles your fancy. Focusing purely on the gameplay and content without worrying about graphics gives you a lot of freedom (though HTML makes it fairly trivial to create a basic GUI).<p>One thing I've been getting into recently is roguelikes such as NetHack, which do have graphics, but very minimal ones (usually entities are represented by ASCII characters). As they often feature procedurally generated content and AI, I think they could be an interesting project to work on from a CS perspective.",1255104247

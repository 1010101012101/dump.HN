If you're doing a story on Burma, I want you to be in Burma, not in San Francisco sipping a Latte, posting an ad such as ""Myanmar: $100 for picture of demonstrating anti-government crowd"".

When people come to me with such a problem I can usually figure out a way they can get their invention while avoiding the patent.

(And soy is even cheaper, if you prefer soy) I usually mix it up with a noncaloric sweetener now to overpower the strong taste.<p>For a dessert you can mix the powder, peanut butter, a banana, and some dark chocolate together...microwave or blend it. I haven't really perfected that recipe though, I use a cup of protein powder and it's too much relative to the other ingredients.",1270325481
1239060,comment,1238930,1239007,0,0,anamax,,,"> To me though, nothing says it clearer than that Intel internally converts CISC instructions to a series of RISC instructions, then enters them into the pipeline.<p>One problem with that argument is that RISC machines do the same thing.<p>Another problem is that there are different amounts of available/potential bandwidth at different points.  For example, L2 accesses are far more expensive than what a decoder can produce.<p>There's always some benefit to reducing the number of control bits, but it is especially pronounced the further that you get from functional units.<p>BTW - ""the pipeline"" is misleading.  Many implementations use multiple pipelines even for a single instruction stream.<p>> Within the field though, it's taken for fact.<p>There may be a theoretical advantage, but if so, it is small relative to many other factors.<p>I've actually helped define a commercial ISA (RISC FWIW).",1270325480

And building scale means leapfrogging the existing players in one or more dimensions sufficiently to draw over applications that the end-users really care about.<p>You need to be significantly better here or sufficiently profligate with the application vendors and the resellers, or sufficiently compatible to overcome the inherent application inertia; you need to have enough ""pull"" (speed, power, cost, particularly applications) to build up a base.  Without this, you're running a furnace with the contents of the corporate coffers.<p>You can't be a just little better with your processor designs, either.  That won't draw enough folks over.  Both the Alpha and MIPS microprocessors had Microsoft Windows NT, and that (and even with porting tools such as FX!32) wasn't enough to build up an installed base against the x86 designs.<p>Apple is playing the long game here.",1270325471

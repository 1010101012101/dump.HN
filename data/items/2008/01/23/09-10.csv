102733,comment,102683,102724,0,0,brianr,,,"For performance reasons, we wanted to serve everything directly from the filesystem instead of dynamically using a script. If an image requested is not found, the 404 handler generates it, saves it to disk, and sends it back.<p>The legitimate URLs are for 'static' images (static in the sense that once they have been generated, they will never need to be generated again) that are stored on disk using the filesystem. For example, an image url might look like:<p><pre><code>  http://example.com/1e/2f/c/(image generation parameters).png\n</code></pre>\nThe idea is that 1e2fc (the hash) serves as both the path on disk (so that files are roughly evenly distributed among the 2^20 directories) and as a checksum to prevent DOS.",1201081053

I thought ""I think grown up men are statistically better hackers than women and children"" was a question that begged to be answered and I thought I'd try my best.  Any thoughts, hmm.<p>I don't know if stuff like this (<a href=""http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2007/12/YE_sexy_geeks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2007/12/YE_sexy_...</a>) is helpful or not.  On the one hand, it shows that you don't have to be ugly or frumpy in order to like computers, but it also doesn't do much to lessen the expectation that women should always be beautiful.<p>I don't have any practical ideas, just stuff like 1) give every little girl a hacker/geeky dad, 2) give every elementary school kid teachers that love and can clearly teach math, and 3) convince high school kids everywhere that computers are cool.  Gonna happen soon, right?",1201080825

102724,comment,102683,102683,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"I'm a bit unclear on how you're preventing DOS attacks. Does the client have to request a ""signed"" URL from another part of the application first?<p>If the user has to login to your application, couldn't you just limit it based on that? Or by IP address? (of course that won't help against DDOS, but that's another problem all together...)<p>As far as hashing algorithms go, if you're just trying to keep an attacker from pounding your server in a DOS attack, any of the SHA1, SHA2, or MD5 should be fine, since even though there may be weaknesses, in reality it takes a long time to find collisions.",1201080016

All requests are dynamic and hit the full Rails stack. We're probably easily in the top 5 Rails sites on the net based on load.<p>We run all of this on 5x 4core 8GB application servers and 2x 4core 32GB db servers in master-master replication. We run 16 mongrels on each app server for a total of 80. Our average response time per request is around 100-200ms.<p>We host on Softlayer and pay around $6000 a month.<p>Also, the number of mongrels you will need is directly dependent on how fast your requests are, and how you are loading balancing across these mongrels. We use the nginx proxy with the fair load balancing patch.\n<a href=""http://brainspl.at/articles/2007/11/09/a-fair-proxy-balancer-for-nginx-and-mongrel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brainspl.at/articles/2007/11/09/a-fair-proxy-balancer...</a>",1201079359

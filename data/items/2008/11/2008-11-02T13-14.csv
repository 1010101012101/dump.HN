351348,comment,350708,351336,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"Well, I think that in the long (very long) term this will result in the manipulation of the physical world as easily as we copy and manipulate bits on a computer today. And that will be an even bigger revolution (IMO) than the digital revolution has been.<p>But in the short term, the only place where this makes sense is for one off items, where it brings the cost of production down nicely. Just like FPGAs versus statically designed microchips (I'm not sure what the right word is for that), intersting niches will be advanced by printing, but advances in mass production probably will have more impact on global wealth.<p>Don't get me wrong - I'm going to be taking a holiday next year to build a reprap, so I'm a believer in this technology - I just think it'll be used in specific niches and by hobbiests for a long time to come.<p>PS - About Rock Solid, I'm cofounder and a developer, yes.",1225633206

Given that I hope to end up with a faculty position at a university, I'd say that this isn't a position which particularly favours me.<p><i>It's like people who argue for Eugenics - their version of Eugenics never involves them or their friends/family being cut out from the genetic pool.</i><p>I wouldn't argue for cutting myself out of the gene pool, since I think the genes I have which are responsible for my intellect are worth keeping (both of my parents have doctorates, so I think it's safe to say that there's a strong genetic component in my case); but there is strong evidence that I have genes which predispose for autoimmune conditions, and if I'm ever in a position to have children I'd strongly support using genetic testing to eliminate zygotes with those genes.",1225632186

Whenever some new knowledge is gained, try to apply it to all the papers. At some point one of your papers is publishable. It is basically running research as one big investment bank and spreading your portfolio out.",1225630895

Revolution may be too strong a word, but I think thinks significant change ala what we have seen with social media is completely realistic. One think to keep in mind is that this list jut covers 3D printing, Laser cutting, CNC milling, Print on Demand, and other technologies can also enable personal fabrication. Where I see the big impacts are:<p>Health - If printing bone or at least better implants becomes acceptable this will be huge for the rising senior population.<p>Entertainment - With the rise of virtual worlds and video games, 3D printouts of your characters could seriously disrupt the action figure/ doll product categories which are worth about $4B/year. This assumes quality continues to improve.",1225630871

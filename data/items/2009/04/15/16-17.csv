Ask them what colors they'll be powder coating that week and if you could slip your batch in with it (much cheaper than shutting down the line for your small volume)<p>It helps, of course, to know how to make the 3D drawings.  But if you find the right shop, and make friends with them, you might get away with sketching it or paying a small fee for them to design it in CAD.<p>This is much more cost effective for small quantities compared to dealing with plastic.  It also gives you more flexibility in your design since you don't have an expensive mold to change or re-machine when you want to make a change.   And, at the end of it's use, it can be melted down and reused more efficiently than plastic.<p>If money is tight I'll get an extruded aluminum chassis and just make custom end caps for it.",1239814695

Generally I have one window per browsing task, e.g. one for Gmail, another for HN with tabs of articles and comment pages I'm reading, etc... ironically it was much easier to work with 10+ tabs before the changes of Firefox 3 where they would scroll off the screen because of their fairly large minimum width... Maybe if people are using one window only, and trying to keep their mail, social networking, online radio, and everything else under the sun open all day, they might get confused, but this is sort of a solved problem. Just open another window.<p>* Taskfox/Ubiquity: umm, what?  Most searches I do in Firefox go right to the built in search box with a simple Ctrl+K, couldn't be easier.  I have over the years, starting in Firefox 2, added a few keyword searches to the location bar, because I don't like changing the search box.  I have w for wikipedia, and so on.  This seems similar, but I'm not sure of the utility of opening Wikipedia in a tiny dropdown... how is that faster, easier to read, or any other good quality?  It seems like some kind of half hearted attempt at taking an autocompleting command line and adding some that useful on the web, but I don't see anything... <i>useful</i>.<p>* Possibly unrelated gripe: I took a while to ""upgrade"" to Firefox 3 from v2 because I didn't like the ""AwesomeBar"" and a couple of other interface changes.  While I am mostly used to it now, I still can't reliably get the AwesomeBar to autocomplete some URLs. It seems to fixate on the first match, often not displaying the second match until I actually type the full URL, if at all.  Not to mention the fact that even when it works, its not as fast as the Firefox 2 behavior of naively autocompleting visited URLs.  I don't need to autocomplete my bookmarks, that's why they are bookmarks! I click on them!<p>I like Firefox, I have since Phoenix 0.4 or so, but I really don't know what they're doing anymore...",1239812343

563683,comment,563536,563536,0,0,neilk,,,"These ideas are interesting but why is it limited to a drop-down from the taskbar? You could make the entire window pane work like that.<p>The last example, where the user is browsing search results, is just a recapitulation of the entire browser concept inside a taskbar dropdown, with more animation and tear-off results. The animation and tear-off results are an interesting idea, so why not apply them to the whole browser window?<p>But the main idea here is that different verbs work in the taskbar now. We can imagine that the address bar has always had the implicit verb ""go to""; now we'll do other things, like ""translate"".<p>Of course the next step is to make the translation provider configurable, and maybe you even get to choose certain providers, just like Mycroft (the search box on Mozilla browsers). But for configurability, you can't beat HTML. If you think of HTML as ""interface configuration downloaded instantly"" it becomes the ultimate end of all customization efforts.<p>So maybe what this is proposing is an interface that <i>isn't</i> configurable, that's deliberately constrained. Just like Mycroft forces all the search engines to work in the same way, at least in how the service is <i>requested</i>, but then afterwards it's all HTML pages. I think Aza would prefer to keep control over how the service makes a request and how it presents results, but the easier & simpler way might be to just make Mycroft-like services, where we are just requesting HTML from somewhere, but in a way that's more convenient for a specific task. That also gives service providers an economic model, if they can include ads or other upselling in the results. We can't assume it's always going to be Google's largesse.",1239812186

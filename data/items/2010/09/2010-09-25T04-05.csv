Programming is a very broad topic and it drives me NUTS when I post a question on SO, and get several replies telling me its more suitable for another SE site, then eventually someone decides to close it and I have to find the other site to re-ask.

1726340,comment,1726085,1726085,0,0,patio11,,,"One specific, undeniable mechanism for this is as regards SEO.  The longer your domain is up, the longer links to you are up,  the more links you have accumulated, the higher your ability to rank for terms of interest is.  If you get to the first page of the SERP for something, you will tend to accumulate more links over time.  Winners win, and winners take most.<p>Even if your company gets shot out from under you, you very well might have a personal blog, portfolio site, or something which folks routinely cited when saying that you were doing X, Y, or Z.  You can take that with you, as capital for your next adventure.<p>By the way, if you get a company shot out from under you, please don't just slap up a We're Closed sign and let the domain lapse.  That makes the SEO in me want to wince.  Your Internet reputation is worth money, and (modulo whatever your agreement is with investors as regards IP) you probably still own it even if the business is not functioning as a going concern.  Point some links to your personal domain and, when time comes, your new project.

The artificial leaf Lewis is designing requires two principal elements: a collector that converts solar energy (photons) into electrical energy (electrons) and an electrolyzer that uses the electron energy to split water into oxygen and hydrogen. A catalyst—a chemical or metal—is added to help achieve the splitting. Existing photovoltaic cells already create electricity from sunlight, and electrolyzers are used in various commercial processes, so the trick is marrying the two into cheap, efficient solar films.<p><snip><p>The problem is that commercial solar cells contain expensive silicon crystals. And electrolyzers are packed with the noble metal platinum, to date the best material for catalyzing the water-splitting reaction, but it costs $1,500 an ounce.</i><p>So the major hurdle for the electrolyzer component is platinum, because it is rare and expensive.  But solar / photovoltaic-derived energy is the future.  Ergo:  investments in platinum could be very lucrative.",1285389837

1726274,comment,1725073,1726015,0,0,asnyder,,,"I don't know about you, but to me Google is already pretty scary. Google has the power to completely destroy your business. They have little to no human communication, thus not allowing for any real follow-up, they're like this god, or black box. You have to hope and pray your begging will correct things.<p>For example, lets assume you have a somewhat successful product, getting pretty good search results for your category, and one day your site throws some errors, or it goes down, or something of that nature, your site is now no longer showing for your category. They don't tell you anything, not even if you use their Webmaster tools, all you know is that according to their search query result performance that all of a sudden you stop showing up for any other term than your name. Previously you were showing up for many terms. After you correct these issues, which you can only really guess at, you submit a re-consideration request describing the issue, your solution, and why you think whatever thing you think is the problem should be corrected. Now you wait. Not for some response, but just an automated reply saying that your response has been dealt with, not whether they did anything, or if in fact you had an issue. This will come 2-3 weeks later, your business may already be dead. But if it's not, and magically you show up for Google results again, and webmaster tools shows you that your previous search terms have relevance, you will most definitely not be in your previous position. Time to get out there again, get fresh in-links, and re-build your business.<p>This is the current status quo. This is very very scary. Even Credit Cards have to tell you why you were rejected, not enough credit history or something like that, you can even get one free credit report in response that will explain things. Not Google. I would sleep much better at night knowing that there was some process that would tell you if there's a problem, and if possible what the reasons were, in general terms. Once you correct them you should be able to submit that you did, and hopefully that would address the situation in some reasonable amount of time.<p>It's crazy that most of us are ok with a search engine dominating 70% or so of search, without any ability to resolve conflicts, ask questions, or anything. We can only click buttons and hope that after enough times the great Google will listen.",1285388045

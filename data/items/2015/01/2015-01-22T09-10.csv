If instead of having movies- say we&#x27;re going to have that script performed by the local town troupe. So in every small town in America (if movies didn&#x27;t exist), they would have to then recreate </i>The Dark Knight<i>. You know, with home-sewn costumes and jumping across the stage and not getting their lines quite right, and not really looking like the people in the movie, and no special effects or anything. That would suck! It would be terrible. That&#x27;s education.</i><p>-- Elon Musk (chatting with Sal Khan)[1]<p>I think there&#x27;s a ton of improvement to be had in the education space. People have used technology to make many forms of entertainment more compelling, but education is pretty similar to half a century ago: classrooms, teachers, lectures, etc. A lot of the stagnation is due to bureaucratic and legislative inertia, which isn&#x27;t such a big problem in countries lacking widespread public schooling.<p>With regards to cost and bandwidth issues: Remember, Gates&#x27;s predictions/goals are for the next 15 years. Technology is only going to get cheaper and faster. In 2000, iPods didn&#x27;t exist.

Tell publishers to either make a reasonable demo,<p>Ouya used to require every game to have a demo or to be free-to-play. They ditched it[1]. I believe MS still has the mandatory demo on Xbox live arcade (digital only games) but only for the 360 titles, they allow publishers to decide for the XB1 [2]. I cannot possibly know their reasons but my guess is that demos are expensive to make. Giving a refund has not been tried as far as I know but Sony had something similar with one hour limited full games for free. I believe they stopped releasing these few years ago.

Even without Einstein, somebody probably would have handled that stuff.<p>However, general relativity was definitely ahead of its time.  It took decades until we could even test it.<p>Finally, while Einstein &quot;lost&quot; the Bohr-Einstein debate about the nature of quantum mechanics, the problem was actually the experiments of the day.  One of the strikes against Einstein was the fact that the field formulation predicts that excited electrons in atoms <i>do not decay</i> which everybody knew was an incorrect prediction.

* Rush hour no-stopping (because drivers tend to stop/wait on busy streets)
* Rush hour no-parking (often used to switch a lane to/from parking)
* School zone loading-only during pick-up/drop-off times
* Loading-only (or taxi) zones during busy bar nights (Friday/Saturday nights)
* Permit parking exemptions (so people who live near business districts aren&#x27;t subjected to timed restrictions)
* Permit-only parking
* Limiting overnight parking
* Temporary no-parking/no-stopping (used a lot for road work and filming)
* Special-class parking (cars with someone who has a walking handicap, car-sharing programs, etc.)<p>Then other distinctions that are important (that often don&#x27;t get communicated on redesigned signs) are:<p>* Ticket vs tow-away
* Ticket cost increases (LA has &quot;anti-gridlock zones&quot; that double the fines during rush hours)
* How to pay (e.g. for areas with centralized meters or maybe pay-by-phone)<p>* * *<p>Each of those special-case restrictions has a good purpose (theoretically the city has determined they&#x27;ll be somehow beneficial) so to make parking simpler, they&#x27;ll either need to do away with special cases or expand them to make parking more restrictive.<p>In addition, most signs come from a template and it&#x27;s probably much easier / more cost effective to just grab a sign off a stack or just fill in a template.<p>After I saw these signs, I thought they were a great idea but after looking around where I actually park, they would make parking much more confusing. The sign outside my apartment says &quot;No parking 10 a.m. - 1 p.m. Thursdays, Street cleaning&quot; and the nearby business district has &quot;2 hour parking M-F 8 a.m. - 8 p.m. and Weekends 10 a.m. - 6 p.m.&quot;.<p>Most of the huge/confusing signs you find pictures of online are 1-2 normal restrictions stacked with a lot of single-day temporary signs. (I&#x27;m guessing a lot of construction/movies buy signs that say &quot;no parking&quot; with a single weekday and it&#x27;s easier to buy two, one for Friday and one for Saturday, than it is to custom-make one with &quot;Friday & Saturday&quot;.)<p>Keep in mind that these signs are <i>in addition</i> to other roadway markings like painted curbs, painted meters (short-term parking meters are often painted a different color), and flashing parking meters (most LA parking meters have a flashing light during a restricted parking period). Also drivers need to be able to scan the parking signs when they&#x27;re going 10-20mph so color codes and large symbols often help to know when a restriction starts/ends.<p>The majority of the time, parking signs are very clear and seem well designed. Some of the worst cases (say 3+ restrictions) may benefit from redesigned signs. I guess we&#x27;ll have to see them in use and live with them for a bit to make a better judgement",1421918222

For the sample question, answers C&D relate to intercept--answers A&B relate to slope.  The question asks about slope so you immediately discard C&D.  Now, even a guess is a plus for you.<p>By the way, that sample question would get removed after statistical norming.  It&#x27;s sufficiently confusing that it won&#x27;t pass the standard--poor students always miss--mediocre students sometimes hit--good students always get it right--that is required for the SAT to work statistically.  The confusion is that choice of slope is arbitrary--there is no particular reason for why which length is on which axis and which is cause and effect.<p>This was actually one of the unique things about the SAT for me.  While &quot;sample&quot; questions always had lots of confusing answers, the SAT questions were absolutely crystal clear.

However, TMS is hard to do correctly. In the meantime, tDCS got branded as &quot;almost the same thing&quot; (I suspect that &quot;tDCS&quot; is a new term purposefuly chosen to sound similar to TMS) and quoted publications about TMS to claim a proven effect.<p>tDCS is pretty easy: put two electrodes on the cranium and impose a small current between them.

They&#x27;re not widely used outside of racing applications, because a road vehicle has relatively wider rev range than a racing machine. And they&#x27;re ridiculously loud.<p>A vintage Cosworth DFV racing engine only &quot;works&quot; at 7000-9000 rpm (or 8000-10000 rpm for later models), a pre-turbo 2000s F1 car runs at 11000-15000 rpm to about 14000-20000 rpm (before rev limits were enforced). It&#x27;s a really narrow band compared to a road car that can run from 1000-6000 rpm, ie. is useful on the entire rev range.<p>All modern engines have well engineered exhaust manifolds, though, but they&#x27;re not really &quot;resonance charged&quot; like a tuned racing exhaust.",1421917735

8928221,comment,8923008,8923008,0,0,s1s,,,"So today I read the article on the Guardian website. It was about how the world&#x27;s smartest minds could not seem to figure out consciousness. In it, they mentioned the problem of how there seems to be something more than just the physical stuff making up the body. But else could this other thing be?<p>All I could think of was that these guys did not do much computer programming. Everybody who is doing programming has heard of the binary search algorithm. At school, you first are taught a computer language or two. Next you take a data structures and algorithms class. You can not pass unless you know and can write from memory the binary search algorithm.<p>In English, it goes something like this. Assume an ordered array of values. Also assume two indices&#x27;s, initially at the beginning and end of the array. Pick the location at the mid-point of the two indices&#x27;s. Is it the one we are looking for? If so, quit and return the location index. Otherwise if the value at the mid-point
is greater than the search key, move the upper index to the mid-point. Otherwise, the mid-point value must be less than the search key and we move the lower index to the mid-point. Repeat until either the search key is found or the upper and lower indices&#x27;s meet.<p>In essence, this is roughly how you search a phone book for a name. Everyone above the age of ten knows this algorithm.<p>What is interesting is that the algorithm is the same, no matter the language in which it is described. English, French, Algol or C.<p>The algorithm is recognizable as essentially the same in the unoptimized version described above or in an improved version where it is noticed that having once examined the mid-point, it is no longer necessary to consider it again and the indices&#x27;s can be moved one location before or after the mid-point.<p>The algorithm is the same even in the human version wherein the pages of the phone book are searched without exactly choosing a mid-point. Instead, a rough estimate of the mid-point is chosen and that works just about as well.<p>So is the algorithm a thing? Yes, of course. It is recognizable. You read some unknown code and all of a sudden, the algorithm pops out of the confusion of its coding and you see the idea that the writer was attempting to reach. You can then look at the code in a new light and determine if the expression of the idea was accurate and free of mistake.<p>Is the algorithm a physical thing? Not at all. There can be expressions of the idea which somewhat become physical in marks of ink on paper or in coded holes in paper or even the the arrangement of a linear encoding of magnetic flux, displayed in the pulsing of electrons encountering a glowing phosphor screen.<p>As was alluded to above, even the representations of the algorithm are somehow at the limits of physicality.<p>One can even speak of the intelligence of the algorithm or in other words, the appropriateness of the algorithm to the problem domain.<p>For example, the algorithm depends on the amount of time required to access the array elements being roughly the same. The algorithm could become self-aware if the access to the array elements were abstracted into a function and the execution of the access function timed. If the algorithm were to be enhanced to account for this time, it could notice a violation of the basic constraints if the access times varied by much from the norm. It could even raise an alert and signal alarm at the discrepancy.<p>Suppose that some bone-headed programmer were to implement the binary search algorithm in layers of abstraction. But instead of representing the data in an array, the dunderhead was to layer the binary search function over a linked-list data representation. Recall that to find an item in a linked list, one must start at the first element and then examine additional elements until either the search key is located or the end of the list is reached. This form of layering obviously violates the equal access provision and would be a &quot;stupid&quot; algorithm. Or a “ugly” composition of otherwise decent ideas.<p>As a parenthetical note, I take this previous example from an actual discovery in examining some purchased code for which my company had paid something like $50,000 dollars. When I mentioned this to my counterpart, the support engineer of the seller, he acknowledged the error but countered with the observation that the stupidity in the code was not significant as the number of items in the list
was never large enough to matter. Needless to say, my expectations regarding the code, the engineer, and the company were reset in a downwards direction.<p>So in conclusion, an instrumented algorithm with an awareness of time, can be aware of deviations. Deviations can produce an alarm which can be sensed by other parts of the system. This kind of a system is at some level, &quot;self-aware&quot;. And it is based on ideas which are non-physical and in some sense eternal or outside of time. Ideas which can be composited or layered.<p>So the question now is this. Can ideas be composited naturally or do they require a programmer?<p>To argue the first case is to argue for evolution and the second, for a god.<p>But in the first case, evolution, you still reach the point of the existence of a programmer.<p>Which in the limit, becomes a god, provided that communications costs are held sufficiently low and the efforts of all programmers can combine in a non-stupid manner. Probably not with money being the motivating force but rather a love of beauty and elegance at the core of their efforts.",1421917359

The best sites I've ever visited were ones where I got linked to an article or essay and found myself stuck on the site for an entire day, reading multiple years worth of archives. Sites like paulgraham.com, joelonsoftware.com, actsofgord.com, and the now-defunct myboot.com are still etched in my mind, even if I originally read them 5+ years.

657956,comment,657837,657837,0,0,antiform,,,"A good way for me to maintain motivation when slogging through information-dense nonfiction books (like textbooks, programming language manuals) is to read through actively (writing notes/questions in margins or post-its) and then to quickly ""generate"" something from what I just learned. For instance, if I am reading a math textbook, I will play with the theorems, adding and subtracting conditions and generating counterexamples, and then do all the problems and TeX them up. If I am reading a philosophy book, I will summarize the accounts of the section and then argue my own perspective, essentially writing a brief philosophy paper. If I am reading something that I tend to mostly disagree with, like GEB, I will even try and write a ""devil's advocate"" paper, where I try suspend by disbelief and figure out why the particular perspective has appeal by arguing against myself.<p>In the short run, this may mean that you take a lot more time to finish books, but it has drastically improved my ability to recall what I have learned and my ability to not  abandon the process after I hit a wall. This not only because you are immediately reinforcing what you have just learned, but I've found that if I see the fruit of my labors, even if it's just a steadily growing PDF on my desktop or a short, elegant program in my home directory, it provides just enough to motivation to finish the next chapter, and the next chapter, until you're finally done.",1245041924

The signal-to-noise ratio of poker is relatively low, especially when you're dealing with win rates that are only slightly above zero (as is normally the case with poker bots).  A hypothetical player whose ""true"" winrate is -0.5 BB/100 could easily play 30,000 hands and win more than 100BB, due to randomness.  So you need a vast number of hands to determine if you're actually employing a winning strategy.",1245041873

Detroit in particular is two cities.  We could call them Red Detroit and Blue Detroit.

The idea is that every time you consciously make an affirmation, your subconscious corrects it, as in:<p>I am an outgoing person.\n- <i>no, I'm not.</i><p>I am an outgoing person.\n- <i>no, I'm not.</i><p>I am an outgoing person.\n- <i>no, I'm not.</i><p>The subconscious wins, and what actually gets affirmed is that you're not an outgoing person.

When positive self-statements strongly conflict with self-perception, she argues, there is not mere resistance but a reinforcing of self-perception. People who view themselves as unlovable find saying that they are so unbelievable that it strengthens their own negative view rather than reversing it. Given that many readers of self-help books that encourage positive self-statements are likely to suffer from low self-esteem, they may be worse than useless.""",1245040762

657912,comment,652650,655570,0,0,dmfdmf,,,"> I am sorry your doctor didn't take it seriously<p>In a sense he did take me and himself seriously. By the accepted theory on apnea, my symptoms were impossible. Hence the dismissal. In the docs mind its as if I were arguing for ET or Loch Ness, etc.  I appreciate your compassion but you should be sorry that my docs did not have an open mind.<p>> but I'd wait before accusing of ""arrogance, condescension and non-sense"".<p>Well, your comment on block-on-exhale was non-sense by your own standards and a pretty standard reply which you did not defend. If you point this out to a doctor they do not explain, they get defensive or dismissive -- just like you. Is that arrogance or condescension?, I forget. You wouldn't happen to be a doctor would you? BTW, I noted that you did not address the issue of the stats and I can see that might sound like a conspiracy but is not. Its just the way that the medical industry rolls but you have to dig in to get the details and most docs don't have the time and take the JAMA articles at face value.<p>> You make it sound like a conspiracy.<p>I hardly think my supposition that the docs have missed something here amounts to a conspiracy.  No tinfoil required, just read medical history.  How about the highschool girl who self-diagnosed Crohn's disease in biology class just last week that all her doctors had missed. Or Drs. Semmelweis and Oliver Wendell Homes who advocated hand washing during childbirth to prevent puerperal fever and were treated with ""disdain and hostility"" <i>by their own colleagues</i> per historical accounts. (Imagine their attitude if the patients had suggested that the docs wash their hands!)<p>And let's not forget how patients with ulcers were told the cause is spicy foods and stress until Drs. Marshall and Warren proved that H. Pylori bacteria was the cause.  Do you think that patients who followed orders were accussed of cheating on spicy foods and, despite reducing stress levels, still had no relief? How much do you want to bet that 30% of those who followed the Rx under the wrong theory found relief and 70% of those who followed the Rx got no relief and gave up. Those who gave up were then omitted from the stats as ""non-compliant"" and the Rx of bland food and reduced stress was 100% effective ""when used correctly"" as reported in JAMA and by crocowhile. I could go on but I think you get the point -- doctors miss things and wrong cause yields no or limited cure, no conspiracy required.<p>> Why don't you go to a sleep center, see a sleep doctor and have a polysomnography done?<p>Tried that but it is a long and windy road with many tollbooths along the way and no assurance of reaching the destination.<p>> That way you'll make sure what the problem is. With a polysomnography they routinely measure the air influx in and out: if you have in but not out they'll see that, no need to ""look for it"".<p>This is an incredibly naive statement that makes me think that a) you are an academic and b) you've never had a medical condition that requires the doc to actually think.<p>Anyway, one sleep doc said the standard Rx no matter how I block is diet, CPAP then surgery. He was not open to the discussion that CPAP makes no sense for block on exhale and could not even confirm that the sleep test would identify that.  I contacted a sleep tech who administers these tests and he said they don't look for block type, they just count blocks per hour that disrupt sleep. So many per hour and you qualify for CPAP per the insurance industry. I guess when all you have is a CPAP everything looks like a nail, or something like that.<p>> Good luck!<p>Thanks!<p>Fortunately, I am able to control my apnea on my own using a variety of techniques. However, I have no guarantee that this will remain so as I get older. Plus a medical professional solution would almost certainly be better. As I stated in my prior reply, I am hopeful that a medical researcher or doctor with an open mind comes across this thread and question the current apnea theory so a solution can be found. On that optimistic note, perhaps you can forward this thread to one of your colleagues. Thanks.",1245039430

However, there's a brief note in the article which isn't really addressed in detail: students need computer access to use an on-line text. Although computer access is increasing, poorer students wouldn't have the same amount of access (if any) as students from better-off families.<p>I can think of a few ways to lessen this problem. One would be to ensure that public libraries are freely accessible to students, and offer Internet access for students who don't have it at home. Another option would be to allow students to print out, at school, relevant materials from on-line texts.

Some things need a tender loving hand with careful consideration during configuration (I'm a poet and I didn't even know it).<p>You can't really build a one-size-fits-all distribution for everyone. Sure you can get a basic LAMP stack setup, but 1) is that what you really want in a PHP situation and 2) not everyone is rolling a simple PHP website these days.<p>If what you're trying to solve is the problem with ""scalability"" then a Distro isn't gonna help. A carefully constructed architecture and implementation is what will. I personally tend to shy away from a big cluster of apt-get installations in favor of installing certain things straight from source. You can bet that all of the huge sites out there are rolling their own too.. Facebook has their own version of Apache and so do companies like Yahoo.<p>I think something like this might be good for simple in-house development and testing, but again, not everyone's needs are the same. I totally love server configuration, and oftentimes it gives me a real nice break from coding and designing. There is nothing more fun and satisfying than getting a new server up in just a few hours configured to the best of my abilities.<p>Whateva hopefully these comments make sense.

What would you think of the phrase, ""Sexual selection and the Macbook Air?""<p><a href=""http://www.dbskeptic.com/2008/08/03/sexual-selection-and-how-the-peacock-got-its-tail"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dbskeptic.com/2008/08/03/sexual-selection-and-how...</a><p><i>In many animals, sexual selection takes the form of elaborate ornamentation - often in just the male of the species.  Two well-known examples are a peacock’s feathers and the brilliant red plumage of the male cardinal.  Scientists like Robert Trivers have theorized that in most species it is the male that competes for female access because the female makes a larger contribution to the offspring.  In one experiment, scientists were able to vary the relative contributions to offspring in Katydids and they observed that when the males’ contribution was more valuable, females began to compete for males.<p>However, there is significant cost to these ornaments. So why would the genes that direct the growth of ornamental structures not reduce reproductive fitness?  After all, the energy that a peacock uses to produce his tail could be used to find a mate or produce sperm.  In this example, there are two hypotheses about sexual selection. One is that the ornament is a signal that the male is healthy. After all, a sickly male can’t produce and maintain the elaborate ornamentation.</i>",1221614703

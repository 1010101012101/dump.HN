I'm not saying AS2 is any better.  AS3 fixed many things that were wrong in AS2, but at the same time, they bloated it to a point were it is not really a scripting langauge anymore.",1218794268

276891,comment,276687,276687,0,0,sh1mmer,,,"HTTP is an implementation of REST. REST is an architectural style defined by Roy Fielding in his PhD thesis.<p>The point of using common verbs for common actions and sticking to it is that you get to be able to predict the interface.<p>The overloaded POST vs PUT thing is much less of an issue than other un-RESTful things. The reason not to use RPC style interfaces is that you hide data behind the interface. One of the major wins of RESTful architecture is to make all resources addressable. E.g. I can directly refer to data using a URI.",1218793891

Is Microsoft worse at managing clusters than Google?  I'm sure there's <i>some</i> reason why Microsoft uses fewer more powerful servers while Google uses more less powerful servers.",1218792094

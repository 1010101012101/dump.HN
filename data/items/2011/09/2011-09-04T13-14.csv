Hajdukovic is quoted as saying that he's ""currently expanding his theory to account for these observations."" That translates as ""I haven't found a compelling way of explaining them yet.""<p>It's great that he's considering alternatives to the usual approach, and it would be fantastic to have a second viable model to test observations against: competing theories encourage open-mindedness. I'm really happy to have his work up on the arXiv. But I don't believe that a speculative idea like this merits attention in the mainstream press until it can at least give plausible explanations for the major successes of existing models.",1315144793

2959404,comment,2959240,2959240,1,0,hollerith,,,"Almost all of the energy needs of the human body is satisfied by molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which is produced in the mitochondria. Every cell contains many mitochondria.<p>Neurons use the ATP to pump sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane (from inside the cell to outside the cell or vice-versa) causing an electric gradient across the membrane much like the gradient in a capacitor. When the neuron ""fires"", the ""capacitor"" is discharged. The discharging happens much faster than the charging caused by the sodium and potassium pumps. The neuron is arranged so that this discharging process tends strongly to ""cascade"" or ""propagate"" down the long thin part of the neuron -- and that is a simplified explanation of how ""electrical signals"" travel in the brain.",1315144714

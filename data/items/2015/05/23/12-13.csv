From the link I posted [0] in my other comment:<p>&quot;<i>The CFTC and OCC orders for Citi have no profit figures at all. So we have one case of Citi making $99,000. The FCA order covers conduct over a six-year period, though that might be a bit generous. Figure 250 trading days a year and you get $150 million of profits for Citi if every single day was as &quot;impressive&quot; and &quot;lovely&quot; as the day singled out by the FCA as, one assumes, a particularly egregious example of manipulation. That&#x27;s not the case: The CFTC order, for instance, recounts a fixing in which &quot;the Citibank trader reported that he was &#x27;hosed.&#x27;&quot; The manipulation was not foolproof, and fools abounded. But take $150 million as an upper bound, and Citi paid about an order of magnitude more in fines than it made in manipulative profits.</i>&quot;<p>0. <a href=""http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-11-12/banks-manipulated-foreign-exchange-in-ways-you-can-t-teach"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-11-12/banks-manip...</a>",1432385901

9592760,comment,9592583,9592583,0,0,davismwfl,,,"That&#x27;s a big question.  It depends on how you plan to monetize your product and in what space it sits.  Also, open doesn&#x27;t have to mean unregulated.  You can (and IMO should) have people register for the rights to use your API, and the licensing terms should be that you can revoke their license under certain circumstances.  Think of it like Apple vs Android.  Apple is super closed off, (wouldn&#x27;t personally go there for my own product), but Android for a long time was the wild west, some argue it still is.  So if you are too open you can actually hurt your products success because too many people provide a poor experience around your product and your product starts to take the blame not the app developer.  Whereas with Apple, they try to control so much that it is sometimes impossible to get legitimate apps published timely or at all, even defect fixes can take too much time to get released.<p>I know, I didn&#x27;t answer really.  That&#x27;s because I really think it depends.  However, I would always side on the openness, but openness with some controls to make sure users have a good experience.  As for concern over someone writing a better app then you do, I like the attitude overall.  If someone does, buy it from them, hire them or use it as motivation to make yours better.  Competition is good, it can generally make good things great in the hands of motivated people.<p>As for competitors, execution is what beats competitors.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean you should allow them a front row seat to your party either, hence open but not unrestricted.",1432385342

But can someone explain to me what&#x27;s so great here?<p>The highlight of the article is having a unique Action sum type instead of a myriad of separate functions. But the action still has to be processed by a myriad of separate equations (is that the correct Haskell term? Not familiar with the language):<p><pre><code>    apply ClearCompleted tds = over todosItems (Map.filter (\x -> view itemStatus x /= Completed)) tds\n    apply (DeleteItem x) tds = over todosItems (Map.delete x) tds\n    apply (EditItem x) tds = set todosEditing (Just x) tds\n    ...\n</code></pre>\n&quot;Only one of the 68 frameworks defined an Action&quot; is probably because it&#x27;s simpler to directly call the right function, rather than over-engineering things with a short-lived intermediary representation.<p>If actions need to &quot;be serialized, recorded for later analytics, and generated automatically&quot; then it makes much more sense. But this is a TODO sample app. YAGNI.<p>And if we really need it, it&#x27;s not like JS cannot do it:<p><pre><code>    function apply(action, todos) {\n        switch (action.type) {\n            case &#x27;ClearCompleted&#x27;:\n                return todos.filter(todo => !todo.completed);\n            case &#x27;DeleteItem&#x27;:\n                return todos.filter(todo => todo !== action.todo);\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe above has probably been done a billion times in one form or another. Of course it&#x27;s not safe from typos in the case strings or missing cases, but that&#x27;s a broader issue with JS in general, not specifically related to sum types.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to shoot down Haskell here, I really wish someone will point to something I&#x27;m missing and make it click. But right now it just looks like over-engineering that JS <i>could</i> do but <i>chooses</i> not to.<p>(Regarding footnote #4: Swift also has sum types and is fairly popular.)",1432383651

What would they post?<p>Call me a conspiracy nut, but now that social media is how most young people get their news, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the US gov paid people to post and promote bullshit fluff to keep people distracted from major events in the world. When those major stories do make it to the masses, there are people to comment about how it&#x27;s a &quot;non-issue&quot; and &quot;we need to focus on more important things&quot; or that the US is doing what&#x27;s necessary to protect its interests and the world&#x27;s.<p>Just a couple examples:<p>All throughout the build up to the Manning trial, I distinctly remember most commenters on tech news sites supporting Manning. Upon conviction, I checked the comments on Ars Technica and the comments were overwhelmingly along the lines of &quot;Let this be a sign to all future traitors.&quot;, &quot;Lock HIM up and throw away the key!!&quot; There was a comment about how suspicious the shift was, and the next three pages of comments were along the lines of, &quot;How do we know YOU aren&#x27;t working for someone?&quot;, &quot;We never supported TRAITORS like YOU.&quot;, etc. It was bizarre.<p>The overwhelming coverage of The Interview days after the CIA torture report came out. People were outraged, but then every corner of the internet was plastered with patriotism and how we need to release some awful comedy to stick it to some dirt poor totalitarian state. Now people have forgotten about that movie, as well as the CIA&#x27;s issues.<p>I also recall a huge amount of support for an invasion and increased funding of rebels in Syria back when the US government claimed Assad was using chemical weapons against his people. What shocked me was that the people most calling for war was liberal/feminist discussion circles. That all seems to be forgotten now that a group of rebels called ISIS is our enemy of the week.",1420743304

Yes, of course, once you are at scale (not huge, but making thousands of units) China can be cheaper.  Why do smart entrepreneurs go to China then?<p>The ecosystem is there, not here.<p>If I handed you a bill of materials for a medium complexity product with, say, 250 components and asked you to source them in both the US and China you&#x27;d see exactly what I am talking about.<p>China is now setup with these &quot;manufacturing cities&quot; where everything you might need for a typical consumer product is in close proximity, easy to find and, yes, cost effective. Component manufacturers have huge presence in China in order to facilitate the process. In the US you are exposed to layers of separation and profit-making between you and the component maker.  I should also mention that there are components you simply can&#x27;t get here.<p>Oh, yes, there&#x27;s the other reality: Your product is likely to use parts made in China.  For the privilege of manufacturing in the US you get to pay the extra cost of shipping, warehousing, handling, supporting and managing the components in a US-based channel of distribution.<p>Then there&#x27;s the issue of worker and business culture.  Work in China and you&#x27;ll quickly learn nearly everyone is willing to jump when you say jump.  They simply want to get the job done.  The US, in sharp contrast, can be surreal at times.  For example, it isn&#x27;t uncommon to send out RFQ&#x27;s and get no response whatsoever.  A couple of years ago I sent out 50 RFQ&#x27;s to US machine shops for some metal parts.  I got around five responses. In China shops would be tripping over each other to get you a quote.<p>This and other reasons is why it can be comical to hear politicians at all levels repeat the &quot;get manufacturing jobs back&quot; meme.  It&#x27;s ridiculous.  This would require a cultural, legislative, labor law and ecosystem shift of such massive scale that it is just about impossible.<p>No, entrepreneurs don&#x27;t go to China because it&#x27;s cheaper.  The go there because they need to get their work done efficiently and, yes, at a good price.  And all the necessary conditions to meet these goals exist in China, not in Europe and certainly not in the US.",1420743208

Intelligent, directed actions sustained over a period of time cause changes; a boolean expression of opinion without the threat of some undesirable (by those perpetuating the status quo) action behind it is just a way of venting.",1420743066

8858087,comment,8853088,8857611,0,0,stolio,,,"Here&#x27;s how I took it:  if you&#x27;re just losing sensitivity at a particular frequency then you may only hear sounds in the 40-100dB range, below it&#x27;s too quiet to register and above it&#x27;s painful.  That&#x27;s a lot of information to lose but you can smash the 1-100dB range into the 40-100dB range.  If you choose to you could even smash the 1-60dB range into the 40-60dB range (or pick whatever numbers) and leave everything above that relatively untouched.  This is a fairly common sound engineering technique to fill out a sound without destroying its dynamics.<p>So if you picture a scale next to the bear picture from 1-100, then the bottom part of the bear is what&#x27;s beneath the (effective) noise floor for that frequency.  To extend the analogy to multiband compression you&#x27;d have maybe 10 bears next to each other, each missing different amounts and each needing a slightly different smashing to lift the bottom of the picture into the visible range.<p>edit:  I think people are assuming that the frequency content of the bear picture corresponds to the frequency content of sound (they&#x27;re all signals, right?) but to me it&#x27;s a much more basic analogy.  To do it that way you&#x27;d have to be turning up the soft reds or something to that effect, but rods and cones being what they are we don&#x27;t lose vision in a comparable way to how we lose hearing so I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a good, intuitive visual analog in that sense.",1420743051

Because when it comes down to it you will need to debug & understand some language paradigms/quirks of the language you are transcompiling to, so it would behoove the developer to be as fluent in the target language as possible (& of course, coding natively in it to begin with promotes fluency...)<p>as the tools become stronger the danger disappears, yet the base language has simultaneously matured to the point where this extra technology may be nearing obsolescence... i understand in js there is some lag with web standards boards etc., but taking Java as an example, annotations and other language functions were added while simultaneously the libraries/containers (web frameworks, Spring, EE) got more powerful. It is a pretty strong & mature toolset probably mainly due to the language evolution always being forced back toward the core.<p>From the limited amount I know, the other JVM languages are implemented against the JVM spec which is matured in a similar way, thus facilitating easier implementation of language features & interoperability.",1420742530

The idea for the app was to make a simple, Mac-like alternative to ArcGIS and QGIS that makes it easy to plot points, import Shapefiles, and create chloropleth maps and animations without first wanting to open your veins in a bathtub.<p>It was my first desktop app, so the code isn&#x27;t great, but it&#x27;s found a loyal user base over the years has netted over $50k since 2011. Unfortunately, Magic Maps is now suffering from neglect and bit-rot, and some of the users are starting to revolt. At the very least, it needs a bit of work to fix crashes, ensure it works smoothly on Yosemite, etc.<p>I&#x27;d do this work myself, but I am putting all my time into another app, and as much as it pains me, I just don&#x27;t have time to invest into Magic Maps any longer. I&#x27;m putting this out there because I&#x27;m honestly not sure what to do with the software at this point, and I&#x27;d like to hear other people&#x27;s perspectives. I see my available options as:<p>* Open-source the project. I think open-source works well for a lot of things -- and I&#x27;ve done a lot of open-source work in the past -- but user-friendly software doesn&#x27;t seem to be a good fit for open-source without ongoing sponsorship.<p>* Try to sell the project. This seems ideal, as I think there&#x27;s potential for Magic Maps to be a viable business with a sufficiently savvy owner, but I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a market for code that doesn&#x27;t include a developer or test coverage.<p>* Wind down the project and call it a day. This would be the least amount of work for me, but it hurts me to think about it. It just seems like a waste to throw away all that design and engineering effort -- it&#x27;s a neat little package and I&#x27;d hate to put it in the trash.<p>Have other people been in similar situations? What did you do, and what do you think I should do? Sell it, open-source it, or call it quits?<p>BTW here&#x27;s the Magic Maps home page: http://magicmaps.evanmiller.org/",1420742440

The one way efficiency of a typical compressor is further reduced by friction, etc. to about 59%, and still further by electrical losses to about 55%.<p>At the moment we can achieve a bit above 71% one way in our best runs (including electrical) and are trying to drive to 80% this year -- that&#x27;s a 50%+ or 64% electric to electric efficiency. We want to be near to 60% across a whole operating cycle.<p>Note that with 55% one way efficiency from the best previous compressors, that&#x27;s only about 30% efficiency.

The issue was his cancer is only curable by surgical removal of any cancer.<p>The old CT Scan were difficult to interpret and my son&#x27;s orthopedic doctor (Dr Dorman, CHOP) could look at the scans for 5 seconds and give a answer verified later after surgery. All other doctors (Say around 10) would look over them for 10+ minutes and not be definitive about anything and tell me to go to Dr Dorman at CHOP.<p>This is big news for the kids and parents of hard tumor cancers. I am really excited that maybe one more kid doesn&#x27;t have to go through the torture of our current treatment of hard tumors i.e. bone cancer (osteosarcoma) and other horrible diseases.<p>I always remember the Star Trek film the Search for Spoke when Bones heals the woman in the elevator and yells at the doctors for the barbaric treat of patients.

Particularly when I&#x27;m working it helps to have injected at lunchtime or in the morning, and that&#x27;ll keep me going the rest of the day. Smoking (chasing the dragon) on foil is much more of a time consuming thing, and I&#x27;d do that at home in the evening, where it will last all night. Also it&#x27;s not possible to use that way in public ;)<p>The kind of people I buy from aren&#x27;t the &#x27;street&#x27; type dealers who are as likely to stab you as provide product. I have regular suppliers who have a much more stable lifestyly, and I either meet them or they will deliver. Yes, they&#x27;re criminals, but the drug dealing is likely the only criminal activity they&#x27;re involved in, they may even have a trade or job on the side as well.<p>Whether colleagues suspect is _always_ a worry. I think as long as you do your job well, employers will tolerate a fair bit. In my case, producing code is hopefully good enough to keep everyone happy. And with code in GitHub as open source and speaking at conferences, you can&#x27;t hide; everyone can see how productive you are. The biggest problem is probably if I run out of heroin, meaning I can&#x27;t work due to withdrawl, which is often hard to explain.<p>But yes, it is quite possible to maintain a full-time job as a software engineer along with a full-time heroin addiction, Cf. functioning alcoholics. Bear in mind that many start-ups often have a number of &#x27;eccentric&#x27; and socially awkward types already, so spotting someone with a heroin addiction is probably going to be quite hard, - as long as they&#x27;re not falling asleep at their desk every day ;)<p>Of course there are downsides. You&#x27;ll probablym have no spare money (GBP 40 at least and up to GBP 100 per day, not sure about the USA) and no social life with your colleagues (you can&#x27;t go drinking with them because you have to go home and score and then shoot up or smoke) and it&#x27;s hugely emotionally draining. It takes a lot of work hiding things from people. Another big problem I have is that although I consider myself (fairly) intelligent and (somewhat) talented, I feel like heroin use has sapped about 10-20 IQ points, and my short-term memory has also taken a hit. This is a big reason for wanting to quit - I&#x27;m getting older and I worry about the cumulative effect on my mind and my productivity.<p>So there you go. It&#x27;s actually been sort of cathartic to write this, but I really have to emphasise that what prompted me to create this throwaway account is that I&#x27;m trying to _quit_ - not to encourage anyone to start! Heroin has been very comforting in the past, but it&#x27;s not something I want in the future. Recently, successes at work have been driving me to think that I just don&#x27;t need the crutch of my addiction anymore. If I can stop this, that&#x27;ll be the best thing I&#x27;ve achieved in a long time, and I hope it&#x27;ll help me and the company I work for achieve even more...",1420741527

A lot of the time I&#x27;m in the mindset of &quot;committing some code to a branch&quot; but sometimes it&#x27;s useful for me to get into DAG-mode so that I can more easily think about how I want my repository to be structured.<p>An example is how I work with my master branch, which I consider to be the absolute source of truth for a repository&#x27;s history. This means that it should be full of complete, atomic commits which are ordered in a way that enables me to do things like git-bisect (for finding bugs), generate meaningful release logs, and just generally understand the history at a glance. So rather than just blindly merge my branches into master, I spend a lot of time using git-rebase to squash, re-order, and edit my commits. I find it easier to do this when I&#x27;m thinking in terms of a DAG, rather than some abstract concept of a &quot;commit&quot; (whatever that is).",1420741435

People claim that just preventing cracks for a few weeks is enough to make a difference.

That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t like statements like these, from the article<p>>those two to three months when pirated versions were unavailable must have reduced the overall level and impact of piracy.<p>Sure, it probably reduced the amount of piracy, but does it reduce the impact? Is there any proof that the pirates bought the game instead of waiting a few months for a crack, or that they didn&#x27;t ignore it altogether? &quot;Less people pirated the game&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily cause &quot;More people bought the game&quot;. And &quot;More people bought the game&quot; is caused by a lot more than just piracy, so you can never be sure.<p>For comparison, look at The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, a game that launched with practically no copy protection at all (just an offline CD key check), which was a huge commercial success. And Spore, a game released about a year later, was a flop and actually one of the most pirated games ever, partly out of pure spite against the extremely restrictive SecuRom DRM included with the game.<p>To me, fighting piracy seems like wasted effort. You can usually only delay it, there&#x27;s no proof that those efforts will actually earn you sales, and you risk damaging your relationship with legitimate, paying customers in the process. That time and work can be spent making the game better. You hear about games reaching record sales because of good gameplay, good graphics, intense multiplayer, good marketing, whatever.

This reaffirms my opinion that you can&#x27;t have a single app that does everything. A couple reasons this may be true, especially in Snapchat&#x27;s case:<p>1. Snapchat&#x27;s whole UI is based around this single feature. Its reason for existence is this feature alone, so they are able to commit way more time and focus on getting this one thing right. As soon as you open the app the first you see are your snaps. Swipe left for the camera, and left again for the contacts. Super simple. Very fast to navigate.<p>2. Snapchat is semi-anonymous. You can set your Instagram profile to private, but it&#x27;s still not the same as having an app based around short-lived pics / messages that aren&#x27;t tied to your online identity.<p>3. Instagram = Good photos. Vine = Good videos. Facebook = Staying in touch. LinkedIn = Career stuff. Snapchat = Random things you want to share with friends. Changing people&#x27;s perception of your app is hard, if not impossible (in some cases). Just like Instagram&#x27;s video feature didn&#x27;t replace Vine (just distracted people from Vine, and ruined Instagrams clutter free feed), Instagram&#x27;s direct feature won&#x27;t replace Snapchat.

The worst part of this library is that the way it is organized makes it difficult to find these problems, or to use tools such as static analyzers to help.  There are some amazing static analysis tools out there for C, but they are rendered useless by some of the hackery used in this library, such as their custom allocators.  I don&#x27;t mean to sound negative -- the OpenSSL team has done a great job making this library available in the first place -- but given how heavily this library is relied upon, better discipline is needed in this code base.<p>LibreSSL is a step in the right direction, and I commend the OpenBSD team for taking on this alternative.  However, it&#x27;s only a starting point.  The entire approach of OpenSSL is dated, and it has not done a good job keeping up with our modern understanding of solid security engineering.  The code base needs to be overhauled from the ground up with modern security and software development practices in mind.  If ever there were a library that should be designed using formal proofs in software, it&#x27;s this one.  Even basic TDD with good code coverage would catch the majority of the bugs that have been discovered in OpenSSL over the past ten years.<p></rant>",1420740263

This demonstrates their goal, and this is what the NRA is fighting against.<p>It is much harder to repeal a gun control law than to pass it (if you look at things on the scale of decades and/or centuries), partly because this is a demographic issue and the pro-gun demographic is smaller and shrinking.<p>So the NRA has absolutely  no incentive to concede ground in the battle for private gun ownership.

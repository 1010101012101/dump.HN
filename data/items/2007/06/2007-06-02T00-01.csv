Shouldn't that background be white?  <p>Endless reassurances that the look and feel is easy to change,  and that what's being presented is <i>not</i> the actual design, mean nothing.<p>Mr. Smartypants then goes and creates a second stylesheet to show how easy it is to change the look.  That'll shut 'em up, he thinks.<p>Now they had <i>two</i> not-real designs to nit-pick.",1180744567
25978,comment,25763,25945,0,0,Alex3917,,,"To me it looks like women are over represented on the site, unless you think that women run 5.6+ percent of high growth startups. The last I checked the number was more like 2%. I could be wrong though, and if I am I would appreciate it if someone would provide the cite.",1180744407
25977,comment,25763,25793,0,0,NiallKennedy,,,"RSS feeds are available for each object listing in the system: company, product, person, investor, and investment parter. They are exposed as link alternates within each of those pages. I know my way around RSS, Atom, and widgets, so you'll see more syndicated content added over time.<p>True Ventures sponsors the site in the same way National Geographic might sponsor a show about African safaris. There's an overlap in interests the brand gains from a run-of-site advertisement, and True is interested enough in the product's development to offset some of its costs.",1180744184

my comment on the blog post:<p>well, most of the comments at news.YC and other 'non-technical' newsgroups debate things that ""dont really matter""; <p>However, it's the process of debating the silly stuff that creates social friction, so that our gears may slough off grit, interlock and start working together. Now THAT's important!<p>",1180744163
25975,comment,25763,25945,0,0,NiallKennedy,,,"Hi, I wrote the site and I am responsible for choosing companies listed on the site.<p>Startup Search reports facts as they may occur. I start out with a product of interest, discovering the parent company key employees, investment rounds and other relevant information.<p>Any bias or non-bias towards women, a skin color, or a location is a reflection on the state of the industry or at least the subsection inside the United States currently tracked in the database. I will keep adding new data, reflecting a more complete picture with each new data point.",1180744066
25974,comment,25763,25904,0,0,NiallKennedy,,,"What's a startup? Easy classifications are any company who has raised enough money to build a nice soccer stadium or has an employee count approaching Dunbar. 37signals is a small team launching cool and interesting products so I decided to track their products and growth. Basecamp has been around for a few years and resulted in a few spinoff products, but Highrise is totally new and going after sites such as Salesforce.com.",1180743963

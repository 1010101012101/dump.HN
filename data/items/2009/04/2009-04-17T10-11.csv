Typesetting as a job may have disappeared but design of text and fonts certainly has not.<p>In my last year of university, I had a class on data modelling.  The lecturer wisely told us that we should abandon learning code because CASE systems would take over within 2 years.  That was 1993, and CASE slipped beneath the waters in a few years.<p>It's true that with improving languages and tools, many of the things that used to take time are automated away, but this leaves more time to work on the higher level design and problem solving.  Until HAL gets here, the programmers job is pretty safe.",1239965930

566652,comment,565206,565206,0,0,Ardit20,,,"<i>while I.Q. doesn’t measure pure intellect — we’re not certain exactly what it does measure</i><p>It measures what it is set to measure. An IQ test given to school children measures their mastery of school subjects, and IQ test given to cadets measures their courage, quick thinking and whatever other skill is necessary to be a good cadet. So an IQ test is simply a test of certain skills and knowledge not intelligence as such.<p>That might explain why IQ has risen, since education is becoming more sophisticated, more are going to university, more people have access to information i.e. through internet, so too the skills and knowledge which is tested gives higher results.<p>That might also explain the adoption studies, the children in poor households have poor environment, i.e. no books and poor stimulation, i.e. parents don't engage them in conversations. So their knowledge suffers because they are expected to watch telly rather than play or read.",1239965690

Instead it would be millions and millions of simple transformations, which could be conveniently mixed and matched as needed.""<p>Right, so instead of writing lines of code, we'd mix and match from a pool of ""transformations""... which would require some means of describing how those transformations should be combined... which is pretty much analogous to writing code.<p>This prediction has been made repeatedly since 1950 and it has never happened.  There are just as many good explanations as to why, so I won't bother enumerating them.  I have no idea why new people keep coming up with this same idea.",1239965534

566634,comment,566542,566542,0,0,rarestnews,,,"Just IMHO.<p>It seems that the article should a little less categorical.<p>The typesetting example shows that instruments have changed (typesetting machines(or whatever it called?) to desktop computers), but it still exists - there're many people very skilled in typography these days. And many of them still have jobs in design companies, newspapers (online ones too), etc. I'm not very familiar with that industry, but I've seem many employed people doing typography full-time (on computers, of course).<p>The ramifications you're talking about in case of programming seem to be already here pretty much.<p>But they don't mean the end of programming. They just mean that libraries would be developing and much of stuff that can be automated - would be, but you still need to go low sometimes. Take a look at Yahoo Pipes - that's a very high level of ""programming"", i.e. - take that, transform, output. But still, there aren't many people using it, because more often than not it's: ""take that, BUT ...."" and that means that you need to go lower INTO the library. The best libraries let you automate the MOST COMMON tasks, but none of the libraries or programming languages available is the ultimate solution supposed to cancel programming.<p>Just like invention of computers didn't obsolete typography, it was just transformed (the instruments changed).<p>Someday we (programmers) will be obsolete, but it wouldn't be because of better types or transformations (pointed out in the article), it would be because somebody develops some kind of ""brain-in-a-jar"" that can transform natural language commands into acceptable electrical currents. (Or whatever kind of energy we would be harnessing at that point).<p>I.e. ""get me some coffee"" and the coffeemachine turns on and wheeliebot starts moving; ""when I say curse word - deduct 5$ from my banking account"" and bank's ""brain-in-a-jar"" ""understands"" command from your home's ""brain-in-a-jar"".<p>But seeing that isn't going to happen in at least next 5 years, I feel safe :) (5 years, because they recently started growing organs in jars.. who knows when it's simple enough to grow brains in jars). But my guess is that will make a lot of jobs obsolete. And market competition would get fierce!",1239964715

566631,comment,565931,565931,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"Despite the glib headline this is actually important and deeply interesting. It's fundamentally about a complete lack of the scientific method being applied in the business world. Instead we've got witchdoctors, quacks and gurus guiding a vital part of our society.<p>Try translating some of the stuff in the article to medicine or science. What makes you healthy or ill? Well we asked around the office and found some people we thought looked healthy, then interviewed them to find out what they do. Okay, some of them died horrible deaths shortly afterwards, and may not even have been healthy at the time. Perhaps they died due to the stuff they were doing ""for the good of their health"" or maybe just because good luck turned to bad but that's not important as long as our initial conclusions makes a plausible story. After all, no-one likes it when science is counter-intuitive and doesn't fit their preconceived ideas, and they'll actively resist such conclusions.<p>Derren Brown did an excellent program on this theme called The System (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derren_Brown#The_System"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derren_Brown#The_System</a> spoiler warning!) where you got to follow an individual as they won bets again and again on horse races and you got to see the confidence and belief building in them.

566630,comment,566542,566542,0,0,yason,,,"While risking the typesetter trap I would say that to program is to tame complexity and I don't think that's going anywhere. Programming is not only a skill but an ongoing research unfolding on the verge of what is hard and seemingly impossible.<p>Training to become an experienced typesetter requires skill, a good eye, and lots of knowledge but once you're at it then it's mostly just that field. You can become better in it but in the end you still do, well, typesetting.<p>Programming, however, changes over time as you abstract out the mundane, repetitive -- or ""typesetter"" -- stuff out to make more mental space for dealing with harder complexities. Programming has always been hard and by definition it always will be.<p>For example, modern languages with type-inference and automatic garbage collection have relieved many from the banal pain of designing explicit type declarations and arranging malloc()/free() calls manually. Languages such as Haskell now allow for solving more complex problems. That is because Haskell programmers don't have to waste their wits to arrange for and solve problems related to programming itself and can rather focus on the more novel, original problems.<p>I don't mean to say that programming doesn't involve automation; in fact, it uses a lot of automation to abstract away and obsolete old tasks. It's just that, unlike typesetters we haven't (usually) had, for example, memory management specialists who only write memory management systems for projects and who would become unemployed as garbage-collected languages gain popularity.<p>Any ""typesetting"" involved in programming is generally automated to free the same programmers to work on bigger problems. Programming doesn't end, it just changes and become harder and harder.",1239964430

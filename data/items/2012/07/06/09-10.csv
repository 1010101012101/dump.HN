4207102,comment,4206673,4206984,14,0,saulrh,,,"This explanation is missing a little bit of background. A classical computer's state is represented by a <i>single number</i> - the concatenation of all of the classical bits in its memory. The transition function in a classical computer takes a state and moves it into another state - a simple mapping.<p>A quantum computer's state is a <i>2D vector</i> of unit length. Transitions are actually rotations on this vector. Observing the quantum state collapses it into a classical state - a single number - by projecting it onto a random nearby axis. If your vector is halfway between two axes, the computer has an equal chance of collapsing into either classical state when observed. As it turns out, this also means that acting on this vector is equivalent to acting on both of those classical states simultaneously. If you have the right kind of problem (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BQP"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BQP</a>, for example), this lets you do a lot of computation in a hurry.",1341568684

(Of the PDF not that article)<p>---------------------<p>> Ensure that your statistic results are trustworthy.  Incorrect results may cause bad ideas to be deployed of good ideas may be incorrectly ruled out.<p>> You also need to make sure taht your findings align with your businesses long term strategy so that you don't make the mistake of sacrificing long term growth for short term financial gain. ie. One time Bing had a bug, which served poor search results, so distinct queries went up 10% and click throughs on advertisements went up 30%. It would be a mistake to say this test was successful.<p>> Just because you see an upwards trend in a newly launched feature does not mean that your users like the feature more. (Delayed effect/primacy effect)<p>> Don't run an experiment longer than you originally intended. It does not provide you with extra statistical power. (Pick a duration and stick to it). Also do not stop your test early. (There is an algorithm to tell you when you have statistical confidence enough to be able to stop your test, so that the benefit can be gained accross the entire network but I can't remember what it's called. It's commonly used in Drug/Pharmaceuticals when test groups clearly have a fantastic response to drugs, and it would be cruel to restrict the drug to the placebo/control group.<p>> Got interesting/suprising results? Re-run your experiment again. Often there are underlying reasons which should be investigated.<p>--------------------<p>> Don't make changes to your application if your average customers lifetime value will decline. ie Longterm v  Shortterm.<p>> Quickly identify the Carryover Effect... Google/Amazon/Yahoo etc rely on something called the ""bucket system"" where users are split and an experiment from a bucket is selected for them. But a problem with this is the carryover effect where the same users impacted on one experiment receives the second experiment too (the effect can last weeks). Known as A/A testing. The exerpiment was reran with a larger test group and with local randomization.<p>--------------------<p>I just enjoyed reading it. I can't say that this will be useful for even 1% of readers here.

If you can achieve greater click per user or time on site metrics by making your product worse at its core function, then you <i>need</i> to have analysts that know what they're doing in those situations, and they need to be able to win in fights with the business types that don't understand this stuff and assume higher traffic or CTRs are automatically a win. You're not playing the same split testing game as everyone else, and you have to have people with both the expertise and (equally important) the authority to handle this special situation properly.",1341565866

There's so much knowledge that you need to accumulate. I could probably learn how to do it, but that would take me weeks, if not month. So first, somebody would have to do it. Second, he'd have to maintain it. Then, my less-computer-literate friends would need someone who makes them aware of the issue and points them to the firmware, probably even install it. Most won't bother, check the box and accept the TOS, maybe thinking ""I'm not planning on doing anything illegal anyways."" - that won't be solved with open source.<p>Open source protects the technical literate people, but it's not the silver bullet that solves this issue. Raising awareness and pushing back is at least as important and that's possible with closed source as well.",1341565662

4206960,comment,4206706,4206706,12,0,ok_craig,,,"Imagine an advanced alien civilization many light years from Earth, where awesome and exciting technologies are everywhere. Many of them take the form of personal devices. Maybe there's one that teleports you to another physical location.  Maybe there's another for projecting interactive 3D images right in front of your eyes. Maybe there's one for opening a personal wormhole to another dimension.<p>Some of these personal devices take the form of little square boxes you carry around.  Maybe others you can wear, like a pair of gloves, or sneakers, or glasses.<p>If you were taken on a quick visit to this awesome place, can you <i>imagine</i> looking at any of these devices and thinking, ""Omg, that alien looks ridiculous. Its telebox is 7 inches instead of 4 or 10.""  Or, ""Omg, that alien's glasses have a box thingy on the side. It looks aweful."" No, you would not do this.  Not in a million years.  The thought would not even cross your mind.  You would be so impressed and awed by the simple fact that the technology exists that it really wouldn't matter what form it took.  And you would be dumbfounded by anyone letting those details get in the way of shaping their opinions about these amazing technologies.<p>If you were on this vacation, and you overheard one alien make fun of another because of the way one of his devices looks, you probably wouldn't even understand what was going on.  Why do they care about those specifics? The technology is just so obviously cool that picking on the details seems... below their intelligence.<p>But we, here, on Earth, do this.  We have the future in our fingertips, and now on our heads, and people <i>actually take the time</i> to criticize it for the way it looks. ""Glasses look stupid."" ""Phablets are disgusting."" Etc. As if not looking ridiculous is of higher value than anything new technologies can provide.<p>I think that way of thinking is a little sad. If you don't want to embrace new technology because you think it'll make you look silly, then don't. Why on Earth would you take the time to criticize those who don't give a fuck, who are willing to embrace new technologies because of what they do, and not how they look?<p>As a 26 year old, I can't wait to get my hands on a pair.",1341565291

It&#x27;s actually nothing more... than a whine. &#x27;I find that offensive.&#x27; It has no meaning; it has no purpose; it has no reason to be respected as a phrase. &#x27;I am offended by that.&#x27; Well, so fucking what. - A quote by Stephen Fry</i><p>Well, as a quote it&#x27;s quite uninsightful.<p>Would you say the same thing to a woman that said she was offended by you creepily staring at her at a conference or making sexist jokes in her presense? Would you say the &quot;n&quot; word to an African American and not care if he would be offended? It&#x27;s just a word after all.<p>Offending people can be a real problem, not just some imaginary whine. That&#x27;s because feelings are real too -- not just actions (&quot;sticks and stones&quot;, etc).<p>><i>Free speech is one thing, but abuse of free speech is another. When you perform an action that negatively affects the sales of a company and if you expect to benefit from it, in return for which the company doesn&#x27;t allow you, I think it&#x27;s fair.</i><p>What exactly is fair about it?<p>Have you thought this through? If you live in a rural area where only AT&T has coverage, albeit spotty, and you tweet that &quot;their coverage is dreadful here&quot; should they cut you off from their service altogether?<p>What you basically say is that companies should be allowed to punish people (even paying customers), for speaking out about them?<p>><i>You can&#x27;t say Mc Donald&#x27;s sucks and eat a burger from them (that would be hypocrisy).</i><p>No, hypocrisy is saying one thing and doing another. In this case, saying &quot;I would never eat McDonalds&quot; and then eating.<p>Saying they sucks and then eating it, it&#x27;s perfectly normal. Heck, I think they suck, and I&#x27;ve eaten several times from them. Lots of reasons.<p>For one, I was in a country were I ocassionally needed home delivery and McDonalds was the only chain that offered.<p>Second, sometimes it&#x27;s the nearest fast food restaurant, or the only one in some small town.<p>Third, their food might suck, but you find the prices great, compared to the alternatives (or vice versa).<p>><i>Well, whether Mc Donald&#x27;s should let you buy a burger from them AFTER you just said that is solely their choice.</i><p>No, they should serve someone who criticizes the same as any other customer. You might not be able to shout it inside their restaurants (that&#x27;s their business), but they should have no right at all to refuse you based on what you say to your twitter or blog or whatever.<p>><i>And being a hypocrite and being offended doesn&#x27;t give you any special rights either. Just saying.</i><p>You keep using that word, &quot;hypocrite&quot;. I don&#x27;t think it means what you think it means.<p>There was nothing hypocritical about what he did. The guy was scheduled to flight with EasyJet, noticed some bad thing happening a few days before related to the company and twitted about it.<p>Being critical of a service doesn&#x27;t mean you are a hypocrite of using it. That&#x27;s the silliest notion I&#x27;ve heard all day.<p>New Yorkers are critical of the status of their subway service all the time, but they still use it. And people are critical and complain about the products they bought ALL the time. That I find a fault with iPhone 4 and tweet about it, shouldn&#x27;t mean Apple shouldn&#x27;t sell me iPhone 5.<p>That is what moves a market forward.<p>What you&#x27;re saying essentially amounts to people not being able to critisize products and services they use, for fear of being denied them by the company.<p>It&#x27;s completely bollocks.<p>><i>Stop thinking of the airlines as someone else and imagine if it was YOUR company. Imagine if you ran a cloud services company and this guy wrote a blogpost about why your company sucks (which negatively affects your sales) and then bought a dozen cloud servers from you. I would have no problem in refunding his money and revoking his service with a polite smile and a &quot;Sorry&quot;, if it was my company.</i><p>Are you kidding me? People talk about Linode and Heroku and AWS all the time, posting the problems they find using them, how this or that sucks, etc.<p>If that&#x27;s your idea of running a company, throwing out customers who complain publicly instead of fixing the issues, then I wouldn&#x27;t want to be your customer.",1380113638

6444170,comment,6443608,6443608,2,0,npongratz,,,"I&#x27;ve been very nearsighted since I was about 8-9 years old. I had glasses exclusively for about five years, then contact lenses (monthly disposables) for 15 or so. I enjoyed contacts well enough, but did not enjoy the hassles with them - cleaning them and swimming without them were my biggest annoyances.<p>I haven&#x27;t been sold on LASIK because of the risk of permanent side-effects, such as the light haloes, starbursts, night vision issues, and dry eye.<p>I tried orthokeratology - wearing a special prescription hard lens for eight hours a night to gradually reshape the cornea. I liked the idea that it was completely reversible, and the downside of wearing the lenses at night wasn&#x27;t a big deal for me (they were never completely comfortable, but they didn&#x27;t bother me after the first couple nights).<p>The problems I experienced with the ortho-k lenses were two-fold, which would have affected me <i>permanently</i> had I went with LASIK: 1) my cornea is too thin for the large amount of correction I need, and 2) my pupils are too large.<p>1) Thin cornea: ortho-k and LASIK require material with which to work. When there&#x27;s not enough cornea to mold/burn, the procedure results in weak correction. Solution? Wear contacts. Lame. We&#x27;re back at square one.<p>2) Large pupils: my pupils are apparently freaky large in low light. The area of the cornea that gets molded was large enough for normal-to-bright light, but in low light the molded area was too small. That resulted in terrible haloes. Solution? Take glaucoma eye drops that shrink one&#x27;s pupils for 8-12 hours. I didn&#x27;t like being dependent on a drug in that way. After three attempts over many months to enlarge the molded area, we gave up. My cornea was just too thin to be able to mold a large enough area.<p>My eye doctor said that because of my thin corneas and large pupils, if I got LASIK surgery I would have suffered the same problems with weak correction and terrible haloes and other vision artifacts in low light.<p>So I&#x27;m very glad I went the non-permanent route first.  Luckily with ortho-k, I just had to stop wearing the sleep shaping lenses for a week to revert to my normal nearsighted vision. I&#x27;m back to my monthly disposable contact lenses, and am happy I can see the stars clearly and be able to drive at night again.<p>I would definitely recommend checking out ortho-k, though - I wasn&#x27;t a good candidate, but I&#x27;m sure many people are.",1380113003

But my eyes are often fuzzy in the morning, they stream tears when it&#x27;s windy (and they&#x27;re correspondingly dry afterward), I see halos, and most distressingly my night vision and contrast are worse. I notice &quot;floaters&quot; a lot more, which can be really annoying. I also wonder what I&#x27;ve forfeited in future correction possibilities. So it&#x27;s really a mixed bag.<p>When I go in for tests they claim I have 20/20 vision, but that test is very limited, and due to issues above I simply cannot see as well as a person with 20/20 vision (though I can see better than many people who don&#x27;t bother to wear glasses).<p>To be honest, I quickly took for granted the miraculous &quot;waking up and being able to see.&quot; The main reason I got the surgery is I couldn&#x27;t decide what style of glasses to get, and I hated what they were doing to my nose bridge, and finally I wanted to try something transformative for my life, which it hasn&#x27;t really been, though it has certainly made it a bit simpler.",1380112386

It ended up being $6,000 which wasn&#x27;t said until the day of the procedure.<p>I was told that they didn&#x27;t expect to give me 20/20 vision, I ended up around 20/40, good enough to legally drive without glasses but I squint a bit.

When you perform an action that negatively affects the sales of a company and if you expect to benefit from it, in return for which the company doesn&#x27;t allow you, I think it&#x27;s fair.<p>EasyJet is not a charity; it is a business I.E. Company.<p>When services were not rendered as expected when the soldier mentioned in the article couldn&#x27;t be on time, this gentlemen publically stated (the Tweet) that the <i>company</i> was derelict in its obligation to the customer. Now he was at his queue expecting to see the completion of services he has already paid for.<p>If I&#x27;m at McDonalds and the service sucks, I will voice as such and since I&#x27;ve already paid, I still expect my hamburger to be delivered to my satisfaction. Or a refund. That analogy actually doesn&#x27;t apply in this case, since the service is transportation, not fast food. If people&#x27;s appointments cannot be kept and connections not completed, that is well within the realm of legitimate criticism, pending services be damned.<p>If free speech doesn&#x27;t apply when critiquing company service by customers (prior to, during and post rendition of services), then sites like Yelp should be shut down.<p>You may note, they aren&#x27;t being shut down.",1380111571

It has nothing to do with lawyers, or protecting hardware secrets - that&#x27;s all just smokescreen to obscure the real reason.<p>If open source drivers were available, it would be possible to port the low level code to any operating system environment anyone wanted to. And that means <i>future</i>, <i>experimental</i> operating systems and GUIs too.
Effectively this would enable OS/GUI innovation, allowing radical new 3D graphics based UIs, escaping the Microsoft Windows, Linux and Apple trap.<p>Considering the dismal state of UIs now (Windows 8, cough, say no more) you can imagine what the appearance of a well designed, sensible and user-enabling OS/GUI in the next few years would do to Microsoft.<p>Open source 3D drivers would definitely result in a quite rapid overturn of the present OS monopoly-by-three applecart. So the powers that be in the personal computer market are going to allow it ... over their dead bodies.<p>Incidentally, 3Dfx did make the full source code for their Glide drivers available (for money.) I worked at a company that bought the 3Dfx drivers, and I personally ported the drivers (which were Windows & Linux targeted) to a minimal MIPS processor based platform intended for gambling machines. It worked - passed all the test code. Then the company went through a &#x27;local CEO was ripping off the company, sack him and kill all his projects&#x27; spasm, and the machine never got to market. Soon after that 3Dfx was deep sixed and their patents sucked into the Nvidia pool.<p>Personally I&#x27;ve always suspected those events may have had something to do with certain parties making sure an open source 3D engine never happened - precisely because it would be a threat to the OS status quo.",1380111483

I now see 20/15.<p>With LASEK there is no cutting of the eye, so there is no risk of halos or of the flap coming loose later in life. Something like 80-90% of the complications are from the flap, so LASEK is much safer. It takes a day or so longer to heal, but the results are worth it. One of the coolest things I&#x27;ve ever done, and zero negative side effects. Infact, for the first 6 months of so I walked around NYC like I was on acid - just amazed at how clear everything was and being able to see things like bricks on the top corners of buildings 60 stories tall.<p>Also, the feeling of waking up in the morning without my eyes all f&#x27;d up from sleeping in contacts is priceless. I literally found myself crying tears of joy and gratitude on several occasions for how amazing this was. I was happier simply from being able to see better. And it&#x27;s helped a ton with my ultimate frisbee game and helped me better deal with sand for beach sports.<p>If you want a laugh, google Dr. Emil Chynn -- he is a brilliant doctor but also a bit eccentric. He was recently on Howard Stern offering $100k to help him find a wife ;) and then book an appointment to see him.<p>If you&#x27;d like a personal introduction to him, feel free to email me (anthony@creditcovers.com) and I can help you get a free consult and friends & family discount. He also has financing available.<p>Seriously, if you wear glasses or contacts get this done as soon as you can and look into LASEK (no cut, no flap). If you are in NYC check out Park Avenue Safe Sight (LASEK) and Dr. Emil Chynn.<p>EDIT: I should mention that with the &quot;HD Upgrade&quot; that I got you get a level of clarity that is impossible to reach with glasses or contacts. It&#x27;s supposed to be 25x more accurate a prescription because they do a laser scan of the entire surface of the eye, and then create micro prescriptions for every area -- sort of like dimples on a golf ball vs. 1 lens like glasses or contects which basically takes the average prescription for the entire eye. LASEK is superior - more accurate, no halos (since no scar tissue), no flap to fall off, better than 20/20 vision, less risk of infection.. Really an amazing technology (oh and I got a DVd of my eyes being lasered ;) )",1380111411

To give you an idea how bad that is, without my contacts, I could see my hand clearly when it was 1 inch from my nose...basically I was blind without them.  I went from massively heavy glasses that put red spots on my nose from the pressure to contact lenses about twenty years ago.  That was a huge improvement but you always had to worry about not falling asleep with them in.  About 5 years ago I got LASIK surgery where Tiger Woods got his.  The halo&#x27;ing was unfortunately a price I paid but I expected this because my cornea was so thin in my left eye that the surgeon needed to think about it before even saying if they could do the operation.  This is all about risks and rewards.  My problem was so significant that I will deal with the halo&#x27;ing even though Green Lights at traffic intersections are a t-shaped mess and dry eyes is another byproduct.

So far however, the competition has mostly gone for feature parity.<p>One of the things that bugs me about the IE6 browser wars is that the majority of outspoken people think supporting standards would help.  In nearly all fields (with healthy competition) supporting standards is something you need to do before anyone will adopt your product, and then you get to worry about new features.<p>I think this mindset of standards compliance has caused FF and Webkit to not push more interesting ideas.  Want to support a video tag?  Do it.  Just make sure you follow the HTML 5 spec first.

The late John DeFrancis had an excellent article in the first issue of the Journal of the Chinese Language Teachers Association called ""Why Johnny Can't Read Chinese,"" in which he mentioned many issues of readability that differ between Chinese and English because of the different orthographies of the standard written forms of the two languages. Capitalization is useful in English, and it is habitual to me as a former editor of trade magazines and a law review. Other languages have no such thing as capitalization in the writing system, but they have some arbitrary feature or another that also conveys information to experienced readers of the language. Capitalization is NOT obsolete in English.",1242271743

So .com can have 280mil, .fr can have 280mil, etc. Wouldn't opening up the TLD system make things worse? (assuming not all TLD buyers allow people to freely register domains at a reasonable price)<p>At the current time, ICANN can open a new TLD every once in a while and allow all the domains to be taken. And they can do this thousands of times at least until things get silly with 5 letter+ TLDs.<p>I really hope this doesn't happen!",1214548514
229525,comment,228883,228883,0,0,ardit33,,,"Ok, I will take a stab to explain it.<p>There are comparing the current universe, to light.  Light is both a particle and a wave,  that means that photons exhibit both properties,  and it all depends on how you observe it. 
The other interesting part of light, as it always chooses the path that takes the ""shortest time"".  Not the shortest path, but shortest time.<p>Eg. If you shot a laser beam thru ice, the laser beam will reflect to a certain angle, b/c it is the quicker angle to get away from that material. Why does light choooses this path?  In quantum theory, it seems that light explores ALL paths possible, (wave property), and we observe it in the shortest path  (as a particle), as it is the most likely to occur.<p>So, basically the are claiming the Universe is like light,  a big giant wave, with no beginning, and unlimited posibilities/paths,  but we are observing only one, the most likeley one.<p>When a particle travels, from point a, to b.  It has a distinct begining, you can pin-point it.  That's the bing bang, if you thing of our universe as a particle.<p>But if something both wave/particle properties, there is no distinct beginning, as it is all around.  You can observe it at certain points, but it also can be in other points simultanosly,  but you just observe one at a time, but you can't pin-point it exactly.<p>...<p>One interesting experiment, about the wave/particle property, is the double slit experiment:
<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfPeprQ7oGc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfPeprQ7oGc</a><p>Take mark of the last phrase: ""Merely observing the particle, the observer collapse the wave function, and made the particle act as solid"".   So, we are the observers, the universe is the giant wave/particle thing, and by us existing and observing it, we are collapsing to a concrete thing (to us at least).<p>...<p>""At first, they found that the most probable history of the cosmos had only undergone ""a little bit of inflation at the beginning, contradicting the observations,"" said Prof Hertog. Now, after a correction to take account of how the data we have on inflation is based on only a view of a limited volume of the universe, they find that the wave function does indeed predict a long period of inflation.""<p>In other word, let's fudge some math here, some there, and re-arrange some stuff there, to have the data to support our hypothesis.   Unfortunately it is hard to know if this is right,  b/c it is just one of the so many theories.",1214548424

And getting any decent name, requires paying lots of money, to the domain squatters.  Even 2-5k is too much for a small startup,  or for a small personal project.<p>Also, they seem that they are closing the ""domain tasting"" party.  Basically you can only return back for a full refund few domains, then you can't get a refund back.<p>So, those ""domain tasters""  that horde thousands of domains a day, and keep the legitimate users to find a good one, will have to find a new job.",1214546942

The idea was that MSN was a brand more oriented toward being an ISP or a portal (back when it looked like the internet companies to beat were AOL and Yahoo), and this re-branding would distance themselves from being either of those, and also help them leverage the Windows brand.<p>I don't know why they dropped the ""Windows"" part from the name though.",1214546854

I'm curious, as I know several people (all religious) who take offense at things like this because it's ""unnatural."" I haven't heard any solid argument, yet, though.<p>EDIT: Also, I think it is unfair to label people like de Grey or Kurzweil as simply ""afraid to die."" They just see it as a necessity for reaching the boundaries of human exploratory possibilities. Although it is true that new minds produce new insights, it is undoubtedly also true that if a single person could live for two centuries instead of one in a healthy state of mind, he could probably do more research in his field than two separate people in those centuries, since he would have both the advantage of more overall knowledge and passing on that greater collective to his colleagues and students (who in turn will likely benefit more than from a 50-year-old professor that has had less experience in the field).",1214546409

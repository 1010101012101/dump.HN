They are allowed to send back to the grid the electricity their solar arrays generate when the supply outstrips demand -- such as during daytime hours, in the case of a home -- and take power from the grid when demand may exceed the system’s output -- such as at nighttime when all the lights are on, or during a cloudy spell.<p>It’s a system usually based on power-bill credits. How that quid-pro-quo works, varies from state to state and from utility to utility. In Nevada, the utility regulators have decided to pay lower, wholesale prices for that surplus power, not the higher, retail prices they had been paying.<p>California utility regulators evaluated a similar proposal, but decided against major changes. In Hawaii, regulators approved lower net metering rates, but not higher fees for the most part. Arizona and Wisconsin have imposed higher monthly surcharges for solar customers.<p>More worrying in Nevada’s case, however, is that regulators made no provision to grandfather in existing customers, said Shayle Kann, a senior vice president at GTM Research, a green-energy consulting firm.<p>-------------- end snip",1452257935

I certainly didn&#x27;t use every feature and, like you note, most programmers don&#x27;t.  Sometimes I would come across a new C++ capability that was utilized and I would just learn and utilize it, but this depended on the feature and situation. In fact, the only thing that&#x27;s really different about it (at least to me), was the constant concern over memory usage (and all of the make/build stuff).  These are just parts of the language that you need to consider that are avoided in other languages (the dirty secret here is that regardless of the language, you still need to consider them).  I liked C/C++ because you can pretty much do anything with it, but you can get to certain points faster with a different language (again, depending on the target usage).  Language platforms capture programmer inertia, which is why big companies try to own them.  However, in reality, since there are so many, most good programmers seem to be able to switch between them fairly easily (which is a good thing).",1452257299

If you discover that zeroing memory for a particular piece of hot code is slowing you down, then by all means use malloc instead. However, in that situation, you&#x27;d probably be better off avoiding allocating memory in the hot path. Allocating memory has unpredictable performance and may involve a syscall and so really, the solution to improving the performance of calloc is probably to preallocate before the hot path and make sure the hot path has no memory allocations or frees.",1452257188

Or would you rather have 1 family member get executed by the state?<p>I think your test is quite misleading since you are moving the goal posts to &quot;It&#x27;s better for criminals to kill two people than to wrongfully execute an innocent man&quot; which is an entirely different statement from &quot;It&#x27;s better to free two criminals than to execute an innocent man&quot;.<p>Sentencing all those suspected of a murder will not reduce the murder rate by an equal amount, in fact you will end up with a larger total of wrongfully killed men.<p>From the utilitarian perspective you seem to favor, you would want to minimize the number of dead people, so the correct N ratio depends on the psychological response to risk/reward of the average criminal. For a majority of would be criminals, even a 10% chance of being killed in retaliation is a strong disincentive, so you would get a strong crime reduction response for relatively a large N. As you continue to decrease N, you will encounter hardened criminals, willing to gamble with their life, and eventually those irrational types you mentioned that do not respond to any threat of punishment. But as you go to lower Ns, your own victim count increases, as you kill more and more innocent men in the hopes of dissuading killers from doing the same.<p>So there is a sweet spot, significantly higher than N=1 where the total number of victims is minimized. We can reason the same about the punishment itself,  and find a spot (N, punishment) for each crime that maximizes the societal welfare.",1452256881

We have plan for a &quot;Superpowers Node.js&quot; system, and hopefully the community will embrace this extensibility and build cool tools for all sorts of engines and creative endeavours.<p>You can find lots of pictures of the app in the release notes: <a href=""https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers/releases"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers/releases</a> and many games made with Superpowers Game here: <a href=""http://sparklinlabs.itch.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sparklinlabs.itch.io/</a>.

But you still have to explain why our experience is that of a single outcome when the only thing in the theory (the wave function) says nothing of the kind.<p>Now, this can be rectified by using many worlds, for example. Particularly, integrating out the wave function to get a mass density on 3-space (non-relativistic version) does produce a valid theory which has multiple realities whose evolutions internally would appear to have single outcomes even when that is not actually true. Fuzzy tv reception with multiple overlapping channels is the mental model here.<p>However, that is not just decoherence. One has to add something. And the question is, why choose a theory that denies the truth of our common experience in such a fundamental way when one does not need to do so?<p>Pilot-wave theory is, subjectively, very simple and natural.  It is not epicycles upon epicycles. In fact, quantum theory practically screams out for it with the existence of the probability current and the many insights that that current drives. There are at least 5 very distinct ways to derive pilot-wave theory from quantum notions.<p>One last thing to ponder. Wave functions are defined on the configuration space of the particles. The specific space is crucial to defining the evolution operator. Fermions and bosons emerge naturally by considering the configuration space of unlabeled particles.<p>But if you have no particles, why is a configuration of them useful at all?",1452256191

7825316,comment,7821242,7823919,1,0,shortsightedsid,,,"Actually, this is a great point. As someone born and lived almost all my life outside the US, I just couldn&#x27;t understand the Fahrenheit system. Having spent the last few months in the US, I went the opposite way to try and force myself to understand Fahrenheit and what I found was very surprising.<p>Fahrenheit actually makes sense if you consider it from a weather perspective. The only way to use the Fahrenheit scale is to look at it as percentage of body temperature. Now, I know that the body temperature isn&#x27;t 100 but 98.4. If you keep that part aside for a minute, it&#x27;s very easy to explain the Fahrenheit scale. 50 degrees is 50% of your body temperature. 32 degrees is 32% of your body temperature. 100 degrees means that weather is equal to your body temperature. That means things like if the weather is hot or cold is just percent of body temperature. Also, 0 degrees is the temperature at which brine freezes. So, no matter how much salt you add, ice will not melt.<p>Historically, when the Fahrenheit scale was invented, body temperature was supposed to be at 100. It was later realized that the body temperature is slightly less but no correction to the scale was made.<p>Every other scale makes no sense to me. I convert pounds to kgs, miles to kms, gallons to litres etc.. all the time just to get a sense of measure. But for the weather, Fahrenheit is really good.",1401512245

But as you said, the sustained popularity is independent of the value of the prize - because it&#x27;s free I think.

7825312,comment,7824570,7824951,2,0,waps,,,"I disagree strongly with exception versus error codes. It sounds reasonable until you look at what real programmers (the kind that isn&#x27;t perfect) will do and how it affects production code.<p>Real life programmers don&#x27;t know the stack up and down and haven&#x27;t read the documentation for the stuff they use. They will not have thought through every possible error case. Sucks, but that&#x27;s real life. So any solution that depends on either of those will simply fail. So there&#x27;s 2 ways to have parts of your program signal errors to other parts. The question that matters is what will mediocre programmers do ?<p>If you force em to give errors through return codes, they will flat-out ignore the errors. That means errors, and all meta-information about them (like which file it is that won&#x27;t open, or which host doesn&#x27;t respond, that sort of thing) disappears into a black hole. It MAY end up in some log file, or it may not. Crucially, sometimes it disappears into a logfile that is custom to the library being used (at least in C). Needless to say, you will have memory leaks when this happens, and you will have invalid state. It may also lead to crashes directly, if it doesn&#x27;t it will lead to &quot;delayed crashes&quot; (like OOM), and all sorts of fun behavior (which is why some system engineers prefer direct crashes : it makes the point where the problem gets created easy to identify).<p>If you give them exceptions they will not handle the exceptions, nor will they get try ... finally correct. This will lead to memory leaks and inconsistent data. And it may lead to program crashes, BUT crucially it will preserve the error that was originally detected, and log it in the main program, making fixing the error critical.<p>Is this &quot;deferred technical debt&quot; ? I can understand your reasoning, but I think checked exceptions are a much, much better solution than return values.<p>What I find especially irritating is the moronic attitude that testing somehow makes up for not having static types. I have never seen a program that has half the tests any statically typed language automatically executes. Not even once.",1401512054

7825300,comment,7824695,7824695,4,0,svedlin,,,"There&#x27;s been a lot of discussion about the &quot;completion rates&quot; in online courses. A study in January reported that &quot;only 4 percent of people who register for MOOCs actually finish them&quot; but that &quot;MOOCs still have considerable impact&quot; because &quot;nearly two-thirds got at least something out of the experience.&quot; [1]<p>One possible solution to this - instead of measuring progress against a single completion date, split courses up into a continuous series of milestones or smaller units. A student could cover 1 or more units.<p>While it&#x27;s true some courses are considered prerequisites for others, the requirements could be made more granular (e.g.: course B unit 4 requires course A units 5 and 6). Discovering these dependencies could potentially be automated by text data mining the course material.<p>Courses are designed around a traditional college semester and reflect the amount of material that can be reasonably covered in that time period. However, that constraint shouldn&#x27;t necessarily be the benchmark for all study programs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://hechingerreport.org/content/harvard-mit-despite-low-completion-rates-moocs-work_14495/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hechingerreport.org/content/harvard-mit-despite-low-c...</a>",1401511635

7825294,comment,7822912,7824460,11,0,patio11,,,"I won&#x27;t disagree that putting a credit card form up is a barrier, principally because constructing barriers is the point of the exercise.  Net-net, it strikes me as better to inconvenience a fraction of users predictably with mitigation in place versus inconveniencing all users unpredictably in a difficult-to-recover-from fashion when e.g. your hosting company sends you a termination letter.<p>By the way, since you mention you haven&#x27;t worked in hosting before: you should know that you&#x27;re at risk of getting your account terminated, even if you answer all tickets in a timely fashion.  Every ticket opened against you represents multiple fairly highly-paid humans having to interrupt their work days.  They accept this as a cost of doing business the first few times.  You will eventually be told &quot;You don&#x27;t pay  us <i>nearly</i> enough to generate this volume of tickets.  Take your business elsewhere.&quot;<p>Anyhow, your business, ultimately your call.  If you&#x27;re looking to do primarily automated solutions:<p>1)  Risk score customers.  You can do this in intelligent, data-driven fashions, but you&#x27;ll get results quicker by just coding heuristics.  Some heuristics which you&#x27;ll find valuable are &quot;Where is the ngrok client getting called from?  Does it come from a number of high-risk countries?&quot; (I know, I know, most people hate the implications here but it is a case of being mugged by reality), &quot;What OS are they using for the client application?&quot;, &quot;Has the machine invoking the current ngrok subdomain been banned before?&quot;, &quot;Does the subdomain receive traffic from &#x27;far away&#x27; from the IP we&#x27;re sending it to?&quot;, &quot;Does the subdomain receive traffic from more than N IPs?&quot;, &quot;Is there a large lag between creation of the subdomain and first use?&quot;, &quot;Does an IP create multiple subdomains either in parallel or in series?&quot;, etc.  You can easily make people&#x27;s access increasingly open as their risk score approaches Presumed Safe and make it more restricted as their risk score approaches Quite Possibly Not Safe.  (This is a nice compromise which lets legitimate users without a credit card in without-loss-of-generality China continue to get non-zero value out of ngrok.)<p>2)  You may wish to have your client application fingerprint systems which it is installed on.  (There exists substantial literature on this.)  Add abusers&#x27; fingerprints to a hellban list: their IPs can see their sites, and maybe the first 3 IPs accessing their subdomain see it and get added to a bucket which shares their hellban, but everyone else mysteriously 500s out.  This will make it hard for abusers to realize &quot;Doh, I have been found out and need to switch proxies or rooted boxes.&quot;<p>P.S. Customer to vendor here: irrespective of your decision with regards to people who don&#x27;t pay money for your services, please charge more.

7825286,comment,7824570,7824570,45,0,ellyagg,,,"My dad is a retired DoD engineer who worked extensively with Ada. Sent him this link, and this was his response:<p>Yeah, I liked Ada because it was very readable, and decomposition into smaller units was easy. I always liked the package concept.<p>Our compilations weren&#x27;t all that slow. Maybe an hour or so for 500,000 lines of code. It was always best to compile units individually, not to build everything and compile all at one time. It could take days to get through compile-time errors that way. A lot were due to mismatching data types.<p>Once we tried to upgrade to a new version of the compiler, but couldn&#x27;t get it to work with our legacy code. We had the vendor send us an engineer from Phoenix, and he could never get it to work, so we gave up and kept using the old compiler.<p>I hear Ada is still popular in Europe. There were a lot of useful improvements in Ada95 that eliminated some of the clunky features.<p>On large systems like ours we had subdivided the code into many separate functional units. Each unit consisted of a directory of multiple packages that all worked to perform a certain function. Each FCI directory would usually contain an interface spec and code for interfacing to any other FCI that needed to share data with it. There were a couple of ways to share data. One way was to send an FCI a message that we were putting data into shared memory, and then the other would grab the data. Another way was to just send a message containing the actual data. This worked ok for small amounts of data. I think to communicate with external devices at the lowest level we were calling c code.<p>Software engineering in a large project is actually more fun than in a small group I think. There&#x27;s more activity and hustle and bustle. Also it does force a certain amount of discipline that one would rarely do on an individual basis. Some of the code reviews could be brutal. Or it least so it seemed.<p>Testing was always a challenge on the real hardware because it always involved multiple computer systems networked together sometimes with wireless devices, and it could be a challenge just to get them all stable and talking together, let alone getting your own code working. When we went to a test facility for a week or two to test we always kept our fingers crossed. Usually nothing would work for the first two or three days and then on Thursday and Friday the problems started to go away and were magically solved, and we could go home successful. It was always very nerve wracking because of course there was a whole management schedule that depended on it.<p>Of course the boring part was writing software requirements documents, software design documents, test procedures and the like. We weren&#x27;t supposed to design while coding, and weren&#x27;t supposed to write any code until our design was complete. But a lot of times we didn&#x27;t know how to design it, so we would write code in advance and call it prototyping. But if we reused our prototype code we could get huge code counts during the code phase, because we had already written that during the design phase and charged it to design.<p>Since we got assessed partly by the amount of code we could write in a given time, sometimes you would find people, who instead of writing a subroutine would just duplicate the same code multiple times. It increased their code count. It really didn&#x27;t pay to write really tight, highly efficient code because of the development time constraints. However, then during testing you might have to go back and fix it to perform better.",1401510833

You never really needed a framebuffer or direct video memory access on those systems. The TI VDP was just barely too limited in ways that exacerbated the flaws in the design.<p>The most obvious: No hardware scrolling. The NES could do per-pixel scrolling between two screens full of tiles, either arranged side-by-side or top-to-bottom. When the screen &quot;wrapped around&quot; the other edge, you only needed to load 1 row or column of new tile indices into place at a time, which comes to about 16-20 bytes every few frames. That&#x27;s barely anything, and so NES games do just fine poking into VRAM through special registers one byte at a time.<p>On the TI VDP, which lacks this, you&#x27;re obviously going to have big problems trying to implement smooth scrolling. More importantly, even for choppy 1 tile scrolling, you have to move the entire game area of tiles over at once. For a full screen of tiles (256/8 * 192/8) = 768 tiles, which when you add the color attribute map to the equation comes close to a kilobyte. I haven&#x27;t programmed for the MSX, but that&#x27;s probably too much to transfer in one vblank.<p>Ditto with the sprites, of which you only get 4 per line, and they&#x27;re monochrome. If you want multi-colored sprites or more objects per line, you either have flickering or move everything over to framebuffer graphics and deal with that headache.<p>So I guess the short-sighted solution to this problem would be to improve the speed of CPU access to VRAM, and the better approach taken by Nintendo, Sega, etc. is to improve the capabilities of the VDP until it doesn&#x27;t really matter how fast you can access VRAM. If the VDP is powerful enough that this isn&#x27;t a burden, the advantage here is that the VDP has a lot more bandwidth available than it would if it were sharing a bus with the CPU. The same principle applied to the TI VDP-based systems, it was just a lot easier to run into their limitations.",1401509808

This is possible to do but time-consuming and tricky.\n- LexisNexis has 15,000 employees, and I suspect a significant number are involved in reviewing cases, summarizing, noting authorities and conflicts, etc. It&#x27;s not yet possible to replace a trained lawyer reviewing an opinion with a regular expression. :)\n- A subscription to LN/WL typically gets you, depending on your package and how much you&#x27;re paying, far more than just court opinions.

It doesn&#x27;t mean you have to use them all, but on the other hand, you would hope that if you were going to replace one of them entirely you&#x27;d go with something with a significant advantage (and I&#x27;d argue in some cases it has gone the opposite way).<p>> What you want is a vast ecosystem of small composable lego bricks.<p>Understood. I just don&#x27;t think you help yourself much if you take out one brick and replace it with one of your own, particularly if the new brick isn&#x27;t any better than the old one (and might be worse).",1401508823

Then look at Cool Hunter, Perez Hilton, and Sartorialist.<p>The minimalist style doesn't suit mainstream media who are highly visual folk. Lipstick.com, created by Reddit for Conde, took advantage of the social aspects of Reddit but was designed with a minimalist geek aesthetic. There was no chance this would ever be successful.<p>Sugar Networks (who do PopSugar) would have been a much better acquisition for Conde.",1258710006

The kids actually enjoy it.  Math games, story problems, reading fun stories.  If they don't have homework, they actually CHOOSE to do something fun out of their workbooks.  At that age, learning is fun.<p>Maybe it shouldn't be required or graded, but assigned and provided.<p>Later on, when they are more independent, I want their school work and homework to prepare them for college. Yes, this will require more of them academically.<p>There's always time for friends.  Kids wouldn't have it any other way.<p>Maybe it's just the parent in me.  I want my kids better prepared for college than I was, and I want them to have more and better opportunities than I had.  I think hard schooling opens these doors.",1258709155

We don't require any particular hardware to be installed in the house already, access to a breaker box is all you need.<p>Our measurement of sub-circuits using our own technology at low cost and 1 sec update rate makes us completely unique.

It won't be as low-cost or as Anglophone as Ghana or South Africa, but there's enough English speakers around, it's cheaper to get there, and the infrastructure (including broadband) is better. And you'll also remain in roughly the same timezone, if that's important to you.",1258708944

952158,comment,951760,951760,0,0,megaduck,,,"It's interesting that Clojure was able to beat Perl in the ""Wide Finder"" contest.  In the first Wide Finder, Perl blew the doors off of everything else, including Erlang and OCaml.  For Wide Finder 2, Perl drifted towards the bottom, but was still dramatically faster than any other interpreted language like Python or Ruby.  It sounds like Tim's naive Clojure code is running at Scala-like speeds, which is quite encouraging.<p>For those of you not familiar with the Wide Finder project, it's a benchmark (sorta) that Tim Bray uses to compare different programming languages.  The basic idea is to do simple text parsing on a massive log file.  It's an easily parallelizable problem, which makes it a prime candidate for testing all these nifty new highly concurrent languages.<p>For more background, you should probably start here: <a href=""http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/20/Wide-Finder"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/20/Wide-Finde...</a>",1258708797
952157,comment,952015,952015,0,0,vegashacker,,,"It's funny, I just realized the way I do certain simple arithmetic is by actually counting in my head. 8 + 3 is 8... 9, 10, 11. But something like 6 + 5 I just have memorized. Maybe cause my brain has decided it takes too long to go 6...7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Or that I'd forget where I was without using my fingers or something. And now that I think about it, for 8 + 7 I use a third technique: I double 8, and then subtract one. Even though I'm pretty sure I have that one memorized correctly, I still seem to always do that check in my head. Ok, I think it's bedtime. Probably shouldn't admit any of this in a public forum. :)",1258708638

952151,comment,952102,952102,0,0,mahmud,,,"Where on earth did you get the idea that Cayman Islands was cheap? George Town is more expensive than Washington D.C; you can get a pad in Dupont for $1.2k, further towards Adams Morgan much cheaper, yet further still in Ward 1, Columbia Heights, Park View, Kalorama and Mount Pleasant and you hit sub $700 territory.<p>Cayman Islands you're lucky to get a pad for $3k, and anywhere you wanna live is probably an expat community home (mid-aged nudist Englishman alert!)<p>If you're working for a startup, your colleagues will most definitely want you at hand. They might agree to telecommuting now, but if they're <i>really</i> a startup, then they will be screaming their heads off at you over the phone and demanding you come back. If they don't fire you by fax or message in a bottle, that is.<p>P.S. Stay in the same timezone or suffer the consequences.

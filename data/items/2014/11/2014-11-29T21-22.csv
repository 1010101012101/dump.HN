> There are so many ways this could be addressed. Property taxes could be eliminated and other taxes raised for a revenue neutral solution.<p>I made this same argument in my high school civics class. As I recall, the deal is you&#x27;re not paying &#x27;rent&#x27; on the property but for the services that property receives courtesy of the state/nation (e.g. fire, police, protection from invading armies, etc).<p>Real estate taxes are a pretty progressive tax, I&#x27;d hate to see landowners (generally in the upper echelons of income distribution) get a tax break and have that passed down to the lower tiers with something horribly regressive like sales tax (which is the general go-to funding scheme). It&#x27;d be a lot better to eliminate all other taxes and make all government revenues come from a flat land value tax.",1417297885

To me, being mean means enjoying the suffering of others in itself (that is, without any other benefit).

They have not been mean in the sense that they would have done it even if it wouldn&#x27;t have benefited them in other ways.

For those reasons there was no developer demand for more advanced features, the features that were offered were hardly used for a long time<p>For example AJAX was publicly introduced in IE5 in 1999, while other non-beta versions of competitors appeared from 2002 to 2005. Websites using AJAX thus were rare until about 2004-2005. There was no need for Microsoft to add more technology until the competitors caught up. Unfortunately for Microsoft, the competitors didn&#x27;t just catch up, they overtook them and implemented some features differently than in IE, those missing and different features in IE have caused plenty of grief for web developers ever since.",1417296353

I would have guessed that number would have been higher.)<p>This is a separate issue from the &quot;handpicked&quot; Flickr photos, with a 51% revenue split. The actual Yahoo announcement[3] says the handpicked rev-share option is &quot;invite-only,&quot; so presumably photographers who opt-in are okay with the terms.<p>Legality aside, I suspect Yahoo will regret this move. Seems to me that the negatives outweigh the revenue (especially since anyone can also offer CC prints), and users may view it as at odds with Flickr&#x27;s 2011 claim that &quot;at Flickr, your photos are always yours.&quot; Also Google+ has better editing tools and free unlimited photo storage (for <=2048px, I think), so that might prompt folks to move their photos over.<p>[1] <a href=""http://thomashawk.com/2014/11/the-controversy-around-flickr-selling-creative-commons-licensed-photos.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thomashawk.com/2014/11/the-controversy-around-flickr-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10296"" rel=""nofollow"">http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10296</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/72157649323144986/page2/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/72157649323144986/pa...</a>",1417295893

Indeed, there are plenty of tools that you can outfit yourself with to that end (Tor, Ghostery, Adblock, Do-not-track, Incognito Mode, and many more).

There are for more people on the internet and in the world who unknowingly consent to data collection and then have little upside in the collection of that data.

CC was a partial solution, but it&#x27;s not really high resolution enough to satisfy everyone&#x27;s needs and/or expectations in such dynamic and diverse areas as the pursuits of art.<p>That&#x27;s why I say that social norm is an appropriate companion to CC here, because the formation of social norms allow for nuance that one size fits most CC licensing really doesn&#x27;t.<p>Further, independent artists are typically going to be at a large disadvantage when trying to enforce licenses against large institutions, so to the extent that it is used by small independents, it&#x27;s in many ways a system that relies on generally charitable intentions all around.

Not being a Mac user back then though, I have no idea if that was really true or just the sort of smug superiority that Mac users always took to their variants of Windows software back then (e.g. Marathon vs. Doom/Quake).",1417295002

Not being mean is generally construed to indicate you&#x27;re kind. But PG didn&#x27;t title this essay &quot;kind people succeed&quot;.<p>I understand the sentiment behind the essay, which is that the ones that succeed in the log term in tech are those that operate in mutually beneficial ways and encourage positive feedback loops.

Friends is a big thing, often when I travel I notice that amoung groups of friends, especially ones straight out of high school, there is a clear social hierarchy. You can&#x27;t help but think that the follower type should have gone alone and learned to talk to strangers better.<p>Travelling and meeting a wide assortment of people really does grow your own personality in interesting ways, it&#x27;s human nature. You get to test out different traits that people who know you would raise an eyebrow at. I bet it gets quite complicated and involves how trust is formed and how people who act sporadically are less trustworthy. That trust game just isn&#x27;t in play with strangers you&#x27;ll never see again.<p>Just don&#x27;t let them search you out on facebook, the personality trait status quo enforcer.",1417294900

I&#x27;d use IE version X, then Netscape version X+1, then IE etc etc. So Netscape definitely faced situations previously where they were no longer the best browser. As you note, what really started killing them was IE finding its way automatically into nearly every single home computer on the market, and the fact that for many people &quot;the internet&quot; and &quot;the blue E&quot; were synonymous (Stories were legion of people who thought their internet was broken because the IE shortcut was removed from their screen).<p>As someone who hasn&#x27;t used Windows since right around that time (I was Linux/FreeBSD only for several years until transitioning to OSX) that ushered in a dark area - there were many websites that I simply couldn&#x27;t use.

Sure, but it&#x27;s not like I have a burning desire to leave tomorrow and spend significant amounts of time and money at some tourist destination on the other side of the earth.<p>I don&#x27;t really participate much in social media, I have my own interests and like to just do my own thing. I have friends who share similar interests and sometimes we&#x27;ll do those things together.<p>I don&#x27;t have to share with random facebook friends (whom are really just acquaintances -- who really has 200+ real friends?) how many countries I&#x27;ve been to, how many miles I ran this morning, the wonderful healthy breakfast I ate, the celebrity I met on the street, or how amazing my volunteer experience was, how wonderful my bf/gf/husband/wife is, how crazy it was at the night club, etc etc etc.<p>I have great memories of lots of things I&#x27;ve done, and I share those memories with the people I experienced them with, and sometimes I&#x27;ll tell those experiences to close friends or family members, or share them at relevant moments in social situations like a related conversation taking place where I can actually add value (as opposed to just hearing myself talk and looking for more validation from the others around you).<p>I do what I do and I&#x27;m perfectly content. Social media as a whole is an opportunity for people to sideline brag and make them feel part of &quot;the club.&quot; They achieve their validation by how many people &quot;like&quot; their photo or post.<p>Volunteering and traveling are two things that some (keyword <i>some</i>) people use as a vehicle to make themselves seem more important or esteemed than others. If you haven&#x27;t traveled, surely you&#x27;re a naive American who doesn&#x27;t know anything about the world outside of your own bubble -- BUT on the otherhand, if you see the eiffel tower in person you somehow become wise and cultured by that experience. If you haven&#x27;t volunteered recently, you certainly must be a selfish prick. And of course these people don&#x27;t say these things directly to you, instead they have become an expert at implying them passively.<p>Meh.<p>There was recently a thread on front page of HN about which social networks middle school and high school kids are using. It&#x27;s mainly instagram, and it&#x27;s used as a vehicle to allow some kids to attain status as &quot;popular&quot;. Everyone &quot;follows&quot; the popular kids, etc. I think the article of this thread highlights how that same popularity contest exists for older people too. Except it&#x27;s on facebook, and you become popular by posting travel photos, volunteer photos, your color run photos, etc.",1417294844

From indoors, it's quite hard to determine if it is actually raining, and to most people there isn't much difference. The lack of sun and wet ground is more bothersome than precipitation.<p>If it rains 50% of days, that means the ground is almost always wet, and the sky is almost always dark and cloudy. To most people, that is rainy weather. Furthermore, the air is often misty and wet, but would not be measurable precipitation.<p>I'd love to see a similar analysis of sunshine. I did find on most days in the Seattle winter, the sun would peak through for a few hours, though usually too low in the sky to promote much Vitamin D production.<p>Seattle has amazing natural beauty, and sometimes the weather can be excellent even in the winter. Summers are flawless. However arguing that it doesn't ""rain all the time"" in the winter in Seattle might depend on whether your definition of raining is as meteorologist, or on whether you have to wear waterproof shoes and carry an umbrella.",1354607155

And usually is, for the first week someone uses it the first time. My friend, a good sysadmin, was often asking me how am I able to figure out how those Android interfaces work, then the other day he got an iPhone, and he was complaining and complaining... until he stopped, after a week or so.<p>I think discoverability is a bit overrated. Lots of things around us are bad at it, and people learn by showing to each other how to use the stuff. And as long as stuff behaves predictable, we can quickly grasp the patterns, no matter how nonintuitive or counterintuitive they are.<p>Or maybe I'm wrong, given how often I have to show people how to do things like setting the timer on the microwave or reconfiguring a VCR or whatever, given that they own it for like half a year and for me it's a first time I see a particular model (or sometimes even entire class of devices) and I don't have (nor have a need for) a manual. I don't know, maybe some people have troubles building mental models based on reasonable expectations about what a machine can do (I observed it strongly in one case). Anyway, I'm surprised by this phenomena, given that I once had to show to a good sysadmin how to set a clock on his microwave, 'cause he couldn't figure it out (and long he tried).",1354606214

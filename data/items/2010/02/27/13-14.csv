1155268,comment,1152269,1153439,0,0,Batsu,,,"Indeed, miles is just a nice name for reward points, but you're not quite on target with the calculations. In American Airline's AAdvantage program, you earn miles per dollar spent (for example, CitiBank's AAdvantage card earns 1 mile per dollar spent[1]). However, it takes a static number of points depending on your departure and arrival locations[2].<p>On top of the $1 = 1 mile business, for whatever reason, lots of airlines hand out frequent flyer miles like candy. American Airlines used to give you 1,000 miles ($500 worth, as you get double points with AA services) just for booking a vacation through their service... the pudding is another example of this. There's lots of potential for bonus miles, basically.<p>So, depending on how you want to look at it, doing this without rewards, he earned $1,250,000 worth of miles for around $3750. With rewards, it could be anything, but surely he paid the minimum amount.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.citicards.com/cards/wv/faq2.do?screenID=801&sectionName=citibiz_aa_card"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.citicards.com/cards/wv/faq2.do?screenID=801&s...</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://www.aa.com/pubcontent/en_US/disclaimers/free-ticket-award-chart.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aa.com/pubcontent/en_US/disclaimers/free-ticket-a...</a>",1267278460

1155253,comment,1155193,1155193,0,0,lkozma,,,"My limited understanding is that national debt is not supposed to be paid off, actually attempting to do that is often a catastrophic move. If the interest is paid year to year, exponential growth of the economy takes care of things eventually. WW2 debt for example would be peanuts in today's money, so it's not really important if it was actually paid off or not.\nHow long exponential growth is sustainable, and how is this whole system different from a martingale gambling strategy is another question.",1267277439

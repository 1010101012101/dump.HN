It's quite incorrect to suggest that people with ""zero intellectual curiosity"" are sought out by medical schools, in fact it's a preposterous claim.<p>We have made great advances in medicine in the past 100 years, but complete understanding of the human organism and its diseases still lies far in the future.  Some diseases have no ""tests"" or definitive diagnostics; they are identified by ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms.  This can take time.",1262497413

1028248,comment,1028057,1028224,0,0,jey,,,"Simplest approach: add a parameter to the call-dispatch machinery. For example, let's say you have functions op_call() and op_vcall() corresponding to the bytecodes or AST nodes representing normal calls and vcalls respectively, and these methods work by calling the lower-level internal method dispatch_call(). What they're doing right now is having call() and vcall() set a global that is then inspected later on by dispatch_call() to select the correct error to raise. I'd say that the better thing to do is to leverage the call stack and just turn it into a parameter that's passed to dispatch_call(). That way you can't forget to set it before dispatch_call(), and you get cleanup for free when the stack gets unwound. (Even if you end up longjmp()ing out of the call due to an exception or whatever!)<p>I'm sure the above is a simplification of the actual scenario in MRI, but I bet the same general schematic can be applied, even if the implementation details are a bit more complicated in a real-world interpreter like MRI.",1262497047

1028246,comment,1027120,1027120,0,0,RobGR2,,,"A lot depends on how much technological stuff you want to do instead of focusing on writing, and how peculiar and exacting you will be in how you want to set up your site.  If you can be satisfied with anything that fits a fairly simple list, and not be picky about small details, just go with whatever you can install and get working first.<p>If you are going to take time away from writing articles to be precise and picky, you need to write your own from scratch or choose something that is pretty flexible.  In that case I would advise Drupal.  I would also advise finding a good freelancer you can have do everything for you, and concentrate on reporting and writing, as soon as you can afford it.",1262496852

The angle of the slope is defined by arcsin((life_expectancy - healthcare_costs) / constant). It's a bit like subtracting apples from oranges.<p>If there's one thing I've learned at engineering school it's that mixing up units of measurement is not a good idea. If you subtract years from dollars the value you get will carry no meaning. And that's why this visualisation is completely meaningless.

The rest of your post, though forceful, similarly suffers from having no idea what you are talking about.<p>Regarding the length of time from the onset of low-risk chronic diseases (unpleasant though they may be), you are right that this is a problem but dead wrong about the cause. The problem is overspecialization and undercoordination. An inherent idiocy in the practitioners would be an easy problem to remedy; the truth is much more pernicious.",1262496284

Something that is hard to reproduce is even harder to figure out.<p>Here's a good scenario, on a good old Apple II: you'd call a subroutine. The processor would put your address on the stack, to know where to return. So when the processor returns, you can peek at the data just below the stack pointer to figure out your own address. Works 99.999999% of the time. Except if an interrupt occured exactly on the return instruction, erasing the old stack data.<p>With that kind of frequency (interrupts would happen at about 60 Hz on an Apple II), you'd freeze the computer after several minutes. Good luck figuring it out.",1262495210

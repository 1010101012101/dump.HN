I've been the only one asked to take notes in a meeting... even if I'm the one who's presenting (because my title really should be 'secretary who we let on the servers').</i><p>This, more than the jokes and comments, is the meat of the problem. Inappropriate jokes can be much more easily addressed as soon as they happen - if you're in a meeting and your boss asks you to 'please pull up your blouse because your wonderful breasts are distracting everyone' you can much more easily address it right then and there.<p>But if your boss asks you to take notes, the first couple of times it happens, it could just as well be random (though it isn't, really). It is much harder to say 'no, not taking notes, you only want me to do that because I'm a woman' even when it's true. What's worse is that even when you do notice a pattern, it's harder to address than a rude remark. It's (a) hard to prove it was because of your sex as opposed to some other aspect of your personality ('maybe he thinks you're just good at organizing potlucks, sheesh' - 'you took notes that first time so well!') and (b) behavior is much harder to correct when you have to point out things that happened in the past. 'I take notes 50% of the time, in a group of 5' just doesn't seem to have the same effect on humans, especially in a society where intent is often judged above effect.<p>I'm not a woman, but this is what it seems to me, from what I've observed.<p>edit: I can't find the study I was looking for, but they had a group of people evaluate two sets of identical resumes, with female and male names, for 'competence' and 'likeability'. For males, competence was correlated with likeability, but for females it was anticorrelated, even though the resumes were identical. Less people will think you an 'ice queen' if you call out an inappropriate remark, but countering the above form of sexism seems far more difficult to do while preserving 'likeability' -- 'what's the big deal, I just asked her to take notes!' If anyone else knows where the study is, I would be grateful.",1332366976

3736940,comment,3736037,3736037,13,0,mtrimpe,,,"Being an ex-queer (bi ;) I've had to put up with my fair share of subtle jabs and general discomfort with my presence. After a long time I figured out that the only thing that worked for me was to be more dominant than 'them.'<p>The thing is, women (and queers) are fucking powerful, they're just powerful in a different way. Ironically, but not unsurprisingly, women are taught not to use this power as it's 'inappropriate.'<p>You see, men don't have a clue as to how group dynamics work. Women do and have been trained in this from childhood on as it is their 'arena' just as much as the sports field is ours.<p>When we enter the workforce however, suddenly 'fair' means fighting like it happens on the sports field, 'fair' means fighting the boys' fight.<p>In the workplace, open competitiveness and overt displays of hierarchical dominance (boy's game) are perfectly acceptable, but figuring out the motives of your enemy's friends, observing when he breaks them and subtly informing those friends about that in order to weaken his support base (girl's game) is considered 'nasty.'<p>When I finally accepted that this was bullshit, everything turned around for me.<p>Whenever someone did something like this to me, over the next few days several of his allies would get a quick visit from me with some nice small-talk and a little one-liner thrown in about how X hurt me by doing Y. Within days X would find himself somewhat more alienated, perhaps reprimanded slightly by one of his peers about Y, left to wonder what he did wrong.<p>Over time it was as if a subconscious message spread across the workfloor: ""You'd better respect me. If you don't your life will become a lot harder and you'll have no idea how the fuck it happened.""<p>Now for everyone who reads this and thinks my description of this is disgusting, please understand that I'm merely able to describe it this way as I've had the fairly unique perspective of having been a part of both 'worlds.' From a woman's perspective an in-depth analysis of mens' quest for dominance would sound equally messed up.<p>Just like very few men understand a woman's world, very few women understand a man's world.<p>TL;DR; Men and women establish hierarchies in different ways. Women have been taught their way is inappropriate in business. They should do it anyhow.<p>P.S. Funnily enough, after I started dating a girl and 'became straight,' the women on the floor suddenly started calling me out on this behavior and nudged me back into the 'male hierarchy.'",1332366971

Cliff's notes: where there is no IP, there's a rush when something is released to it into print and on the market. Creators can sell the rights to first release for a fortune. The US government made a fortune on the official 9-11 report by auctioning off first-access rights along these lines.<p>People can also make money by publishing something, and then getting a job teaching (or some other expert capacity) in the field.<p><pre><code>    > The idea that copyright only benefits the\n    > select few in the music industry isn't true,\n    > either.

What about dancers? I've seen people make all these claims about protecting musicians, but what about dancers? Dancers don't make much money, and copyright doesn't provide for them. Not that copyright protects musicians either - it doesn't - but that's the claim so let's role with it for the purpose of pointing out this new inconsistency.

Out of the box, Rails has none of this. Rails is almost a meta-framework. Honestly taking your two examples: Devise is horribly complicated and the half-dozen admin frameworks that had a hard time crossing the 3.x line (which is not encouraging for the future) are either  generators, downright incomplete enough to be useful outside of a hello world, or frameworks in themselves. I defy anyone  beginning with Rails to set up Devise and an admin system in less than half a day, let alone an hour. I'm not trying to pick up a fight, but anecdotally compare this to Django, where setting up both auth and admin is largely under 30min for a newcomer, easy, with ample possibilities left ahead.<p>So although Rails helps a lot in various areas (like resource routing, respond_to/with), but it still ends up being soul-sucking in numerous others where you have to either delve into needlessly complicated stuff or implement it yourself.",1332366562

In the process, the air inside the hull is compressed very rapidly, raising the internal temperature by several hundred degrees. Everything flammable inside, including the crew, is incinerated in the fraction of a second before the water rushes in to crush what's left. It is, indeed, believed to be very fast, probably faster than anyone aboard would be able to comprehend. You would simply and instantly go from being alive and wondering when it was going to happen to being dead and not knowing it had.""<p>""With the rapid compression of the air, there would be a simultaneous step rise in both pressure and temperature. The air pressure would rapidly approach, but not exceed, the water pressure. The temperature would, of course, be proportional to the air pressure, but what the actual numbers are I am not certain. I am not sure one way or the other whether they would raise to the point of combustion, but I agree that its possible. In any case, they would be high enough to cause severe burning of the exposed body surfaces. Of course, the body would also experience the effects of the sudden high pressurization, resulting in burst eardrums, a ruptured body, perhaps cracking of the skull (which under a pressure increase of the rapidity would be like its own pressure-tight space, just as would the main body), the eyes would probably burst (implode), and there would probably be bursting of many blood vessels. Of course, both any burning effect, already mentioned, and the result of a rapid pressure impulse on the body would both be in a fractional second. Loss of consciousness and death would be near instantaneous, as you state. I can see perhaps enough of a window for the body and conscious to experience perhaps a very brief moment of thought and sensation, but if there is any at all, it would be exceedingly brief.<p>Given what we know from actual hull crushes (and Im sure that someone knows waaaaay more than I do since Im just going by what we learned as part of being nuclear submariners), the entire submarine would not necessarily crush all at once. One example is the Golf-class submarine that we recovered from the Pacific floor as part of our espionage operations (Howard Hughes Glomar Explorer, etc.) Though we only recovered about the front third of that submariner, we obtained about two thirds of the interior works, since the submarine breached at some point in the rear and the pressure surge slammed the interior forward. A second example is the U.S.S. Scorpion, our nuclear SSN which was lost in the Atlantic in 1967. We believe that we captured on sound detection devices the sequential collapse of pressure-tight bulkheads as it crushed, indicating that the hull breached to sea pressure at some point (certainly the bow compartment based on the cause for sinking) and then as the boat sank and the rising sea pressure exceeded the strength of the bulkheads they collapsed in turn from forward to aft. Of course, in this case, each compartment is acting as its own pressure-tight space. In both submarine cases, of course, the indication is that the whole sub did not crush all at once, but experience hull failure at one point, and then had a pressure wave travel inside the boat. (While its horrifying to consider, there is a good likelihood that the men in the rear-most compartment of the Scorpion heard the collapsing of the forward bulkheads before the engine room bulkhead failed.) Given the experience of the Soviet sub, we also know that the forces are strong enough to rip machinery from its mounts and move it, so this adds the final event on the bodies inside the sub, as they are mutilated in varying ways as they are caught in both the movement and crunch of machinery and/or collapsing bulkheads or the hull.""<p>""\nTheoretically, temperature rise during compression is given by:<p>T2/T1=(P2/P1)^((n-1)/n)) where n is about 1.3 for air.<p>If we start at 70F, T1= 530 R (degrees Rankine).\nP1 = 1 atmosphere\nP2 = 2000 ft water = 867 psi = 59.4 atm<p>We have:<p>T2/530 = (59.4)^(1.3-1)/1.3)<p>T2 = 530<i>(59.4)^(0.231)\nT2 = 530</i>2.57 = 1362 deg R = 901 deg F<p>Hot indeed!""<p><a href=""http://www.fleetsubmarine.com/phorum/read.php?f=5&i=20&t=20&v=f"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fleetsubmarine.com/phorum/read.php?f=5&i=20&#...</a><p>""I've heard speculation that the implosion would be similar to what happens when you set off a bomb calorimeter, in which the extreme pressure rise would heat up the internal atmosphere to the point that combustible materials would be incinerated as the water rushed in.<p>For illustration purposes, it can be calculated that a hole in the submarine's hull of just 1-foot diameter (at a depth of 800 feet) would fill the associated compartment in just a few seconds.

Now let's say you relegate Rails to act as just your API because clients are fast now and you want to do some new cool stuff with Javascript also, you're convinced your site is more like an ""application"". So you build this system and it works really well, except for one thing. The first time you load the page it takes a second or two minimum to get the page loaded. That's ok at first, but really soon it becomes annoying. So you do everything you can with your client, caching whatever possible. You get the load time down to something like 1s. That's better but still not great. Some static sites can spit back pages in like 200ms  (across the network!!) and that 800ms difference is crucial to the overall feel and snappiness of your ""application"". Eventually you give up, you keep the parts of the site that work well as a client-side app, push the rendering back to the server because even though the server is a long ways away from the client and even though clients are fast, you can directly control how quickly the server builds a page and you can optimize that to your heart's content. Now you've gotten your page loads way way down to like 400ms. You're doing great, people love you and you've saved the day. I've fabricated the numbers, but this story is based on truth, because you know who you are? Twitter, Alex's employer.<p>That's not to say that Rails doesn't make a great API and that Alex doesn't have a point. There certainly is a place for frontend applications out there built on frameworks like Spine, Backbone or Ember (all great projects). Those types of applications have their advantages in some cases. But, it's prudent to be pragmatic and to recognize that the times where you truly need to build a client driven application are few and for the other times Rails is still great at serving up HTML.",1332365194
3736769,story,,,1,0,mauricebv,"Iterate 3 deal start up parameters ",,"I have been part of start up teams for 14 years now. First as a VC and later as a seed investor / co founder. In the beginning I was involved with product and technology introductions but the last couple of years I am involved with internet start ups. Four reasons I have chosen for internet are 1. the time to market 2. the way you can iterate with your users, customers and partners. 3. Scalability 4. (international) collaboration<p>Let me focus on the last point. How can you collaborate when founders live for example in the United States, the Netherlands and India. There is an increase in international collaborations and the development and cooperation tools are available. But do you want to start a legal entity when you are still in the concepting stage? In which jurisdiction will you start it? Who will own what during the collaboration and before you start the company? Steve Blank has describe in 'four steps to epiphany' the way you can develop your idea to web-concept. In my opinion you can best go through these steps before you start a legal entity. He also describes the importance of iteration while stepping to epiphany.<p>What I have learned through the years is that you also must iterate the deal parameters during the start up stage. The start up team is mainly focused on the concept and forget to iterate the parameters that are the basis of the collaboration. Many good initiatives stop because the start up team ran into a deal breaker situation. For example 2 persons start a collaboration based on 50/50 stake. During the development one partner finds himself working 80 hours a week and the other founder works 5 hours. This goes on for months until they launch and want to incorporate a company. The 80 hour guys claims that based on the number of hours he has worked on the project he wants a 80% stake. The other partner believes he has added less hours but his time is of greater value and therefor he claims his 50% stake. Both decide that they do not have any trust in the collaboration and will terminate the partnership. I hear these stories almost on a weekly basis of start ups that approach us for investments. Probably you have also heard them. Mark Z. could have done a better job while creating www.facebook.com;-)<p>The three deal parameters that you should discuss with all partners on a regular basis are:\n1. The number of hours that every partner invests\n2. The amount of money every partner invests \n3. The assets that are invested (concept idea, domain name, hardware, software etc)<p>These three elements will result in a certain stake in the collaboration. During the process from idea to incorporation these deal parameters and stake must be iterated on a regular basis. Keep the discussion open and stay reasonable, you all have a responsibility to bring it to the next level. If you need seed investment or growth investment potential investor will always ask if all things are arranged properly especially ownership. We are successfully working with this methodology for years now. Not all collaborations will become successful but by using this method we now see much earlier in the collaboration if we must terminate the agreement and move to the next project or that we are on the right track with the right team. We have developed a website www.isthenext.com where you can use the methodology for free. It is in open beta now and we hope it will help you.<p>Good luck and keep collaborating.<p>You can follow us on twitter @isthenext",1332365189

Monopolies (not implying apple is a monopoly to be hit by anti-trust laws, btw, but copyright and patent are monopoly powers) are very, very profitable for the few people that hold them.<p>I don't have my copy of Wealth of Nations in front of me (out of copyright, but I purchased the penguin classics paperback anyways, go figure), but Adam Smith made a very compelling argument that things like entertainment are not acretive to the capital of a country.  At the time of publication (1776), Smith noted actors and musicians expected no more compensation than what they received for peformances.  They produced no lasting product that could be added to the 'capital' of the company.  Recordings you might say add this value because of copyright, but if you cannot sell your copy that would mean it's not a capital good.<p>So, yes, creative works existed before the current distribution model.<p>I'm not arguing people cannot profit from their works, far be it.  I'm arguing that the current model for profit favors a very few at the expense of very many, and does not meet the needs of either creators or consumers as well as it does the distributors!<p>Movies are perhaps the most dependent on the current model, as yes, it takes significant capital to make most movies.  However, is it truly more creative to see the 3D version of Star Wars Episode I?  Or would it be better to see ""Star Wars Episode I: As written By Kickstarter Member XYZ"".  I'm fairly certain Option B would be more creative at this point.  Lucas and everyone involved with Star Wars has already made plenty of money, but you can't expand on those works just because you have a great idea, you'd need Lucas' permission.<p>Anyways, copyright/patents are a very complex thing right now.  I can't tell you exactly how the Ipad came to be (although it wasn't the first tablet), so I can't really say if Apple had the best idea, or just the right polish at the right time.  All the patent infringement lawsuits surrounding the ipad seem to support my view that they stifle innovation more than they support the ""It required this closed model"" argument, if you ask me.  Apple is almost assuredly infringing a lot of patents (which many may be invalid), and I would argue they are really so successful because they have deep enough pockets to fight all those legal wars.<p>I could write a lot and end up saying very little, it is very hard for me to boil down all my thoughts on copyright and patents into a HN comment.",1332365017

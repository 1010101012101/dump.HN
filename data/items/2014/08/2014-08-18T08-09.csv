That the new technologies determine what will be taught to people and what they will argue about, not the other way around.

If anything, it might be a hinderance.</i><p>I wouldn&#x27;t be so harsh on flashcards. I moved to Denmark last year and am now learning the language. Having better vocabulary totally helps you learn the language, but of course should not be the only or primary mean. I would say that flashcards is a powerful tool that assists my other studies. If I was able to spend hours per day on studying the language, maybe they would not be necessary. But my work environment is English speaking, I have a family and no native speaking friends yet, so my study time is limited.<p>The way I maintain my deck is that after each lesson, or after reading any sort of text, or while reading, I add the words I did not know into the deck. And I also have a smaller deck for phrases and expressions. So, yes, I am getting exposed to natural writing, but it is not a trivial task to memorise words that you only saw or used a handful of times.<p>My deck is now around 3500 words and growing steadily, I can read and understand newspaper articles on general subjects and express myself in writing. I have been commended on my vocabulary by teachers and I believe the usage of Anki is the advantage that gives me &quot;the edge&quot; compared to others in  similar circumstances.",1408351902

I&#x27;m agreeing with your assertion that we eat more meat than we did 100 years ago. 100 years ago we ate significantly less meat than our hunter gatherer ancestors did.<p>>I&#x27;ll check you references later, but I&#x27;m wondering where the hunter gatherers got so much meat before they had industrial meat factories that we have<p>They didn&#x27;t need industrial farms because there were far fewer people. They hunted animals, which were relatively abundant. Meat is much more calorie dense than most plants.<p>Hunter gatherers didn&#x27;t have agriculture, so many of the plants we eat today weren&#x27;t yet domesticated. They lacked entire categories of food that we have today.<p>The largest percentage of daily caloric intake today comes from grains--hunter gathers didn&#x27;t farm grains, so they had to get the largest share of their calories from something else--meat.<p>>Besides, percentages is one thing, absolute intakes are another, too.<p>An average adult male can&#x27;t live long term with fewer than around 2000 calories per day (A very active hunter gatherer would require a far amount more than 2000 per day). The average American male eats about 2700 calories per day.<p>Let&#x27;s take the lower end estimate for 2000 calories per day for a hunter gatherer. At 65%, meat accounts for 1300 calories per day.<p>At 20% of 2700 calories, an average American male gets 540 calories per day from meat.<p>So 1300 for the hunter gatherer vs 540 for the average American male. Almost 3 times as much. Even in absolute numbers, the hunter gatherer at much more meat.",1408350233

We know of nothing more helpful in achieving good control of an individual patient&#x27;s hypertension than the home monitoring of BP. In the best of worlds, the patient could alter his or her antihypertensive regimen based on his or her home BP readings just as diabetics are allowed to alter their insulin dosage based on their home glucose readings. Such self-modification may be too much to ask, but phones, faxes, and e-mails can easily send the readings to an office assistant or practitioner who can then provide appropriate advice.<p>For too long, practitioners have kept patients out of the loop, either too proud to give up some of their power or too suspicious of the ability of their patients to help themselves.&quot;",1408349131

On your loyalty to feed them constantly, until you die (and even after, actually).

I have to say however, that from such a new language I would ask for more correct string handling as opposed to the let-me-sidestep-encoding-issues-and-still-call-it-UTF8 that&#x27;s going on.<p>Defining characters as 8 bit is not quite correct (you will get char variables holding a fraction of a character), treating strings as arrays of characters by conversion also isn&#x27;t (now you have an array of partial characters) and ignoring the encoding (just assuming UTF8) is a sure cause for annoying bugs - something the rest of the language goes great lengths to avoid.<p>I&#x27;ve only read the tutorial so far. Maybe the library fixes some of the issues - we&#x27;ll see. The thing is just that if you start adding metadata to your sting types (they do encode the length (in what? Characters? Partial characters? Bytes?)), then why not also at least add an encoding (to help programmers not to mix strings of different encodings)?

At the same time, Apple grew from being a strictly hardware company into a &quot;platform&quot; company. That is, they began developing the software that ran on their hardware. This put them in a much better position to begin developing devices that were not traditional computers.<p>Microsoft, on the other hand, has done all they can to avoid making hardware. It shows with the Surface...while it&#x27;s a nice piece of hardware there are many failures with the device that perhaps a company with more experience building those kinds of things would have caught early on in development. Only recently have they began working in hardware, and developing full products. I don&#x27;t believe they would have even had this capability had it not been for the extraordinary work that Microsoft Research does. But Microsoft has made a ton of money by pushing both their consumer software and their tools/infrastructure for companies to develop their own software on the .NET platform. It&#x27;s widely known that Microsoft&#x27;s developer support channels (if you want to pay for them) are much more developed than Apple&#x27;s, whose dev environments are geared for far simpler setups. .NET shops, for example, pretty much do not need to worry about the latest and greatest tools. Microsoft can provide everything you need to get work done on their platform.<p>But personally, I don&#x27;t think you could possibly develop as good of a business relationship between hardware manufacturer and software developer as a company which includes both facets of product development. These days, the real money is in getting people to buy your gadget, as Apple has shown.

I was involved in one where the winning team had been working for months beforehand (their website was registered > 6mo before the event), had prepared presentation materials far before the event including design mockups, and presented with nothing more than a pre-cooked video that was looked manipulated to show &quot;working&quot; code. None of us knew for sure, but it looked like they had just built static HTML pages and transitioned between them.<p>For those of us who had built working products, it felt more than a bit cheap. We saw some great code and very little of it was recognized.<p>I believe the issue is one of expectations and marketing for these events. They are pitched as &quot;hackathons&quot; and try very hard to attract engineers, as you simply can&#x27;t have the event without coders. Therefore, engineers reasonably expect an event where the best code wins. After all, it&#x27;s called a &quot;hackathon&quot;, not a &quot;meet & greet with investors&quot; or even a &quot;startup weekend&quot;. In the end, it just felt like the judges were putting themselves into the mindset of investors, and in that case, obviously the team that has prepared for months beforehand will win. But to the coders, we felt cheated, and that they had completely missed the point.",1377494102

Then there was the sudden attacks, and a sudden president change of heart, where Brazil would start to supply US instead, specially Jeep tyres, would buy a steel mill, and would help in the African front lines... this got changed to Italy mid-trip, with Brazillian ships dumping into Italy snowy mountains people trained and geared for a desert war...<p>I know a bunch of people (specially, obviously, fascists, but many non-fascists too, but most of them are over 50) that still resent that story, and wish Brazil had joined (with boots on the ground) the Axis side instead.<p>Also Brazillian soldiers got shafted hard by the US, specially the &quot;rubber soldiers&quot;. US and Brazil made a agreement, where drafted people could choose to fight in Europe, or get shipped to Amazon (with several promises regarding the advantage of going to Amazon, and indeed 50.000 soldiers went to Amazon), they would gather the rubber to make tyres, and US and Brazillian government would jointly pay them and take care of them, and return them back to their family after the war...

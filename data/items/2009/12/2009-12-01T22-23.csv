Using an EMC Symmetrix as an example I am very familiar with, a large properly implemented storage array is far from breakable. Inside that box you buy is a whole collection of n+2, n+3 and/or n+4 components all built specifically to never, ever break.

But just as a horse and a bicycle can both be used to get places, but still be different, Ruby meta-programming and Lisp-style macros are very different, even if they are sometimes used to accomplish similar goals.<p>When you do meta-programming using Ruby, you're writing code that is executed at run-time (and can use runtime data). When you're writing Lisp macros, you're <i>literally</i> writing a code pre-processor: a bunch of little programs that walk over your code and expand it to other code <i>before</i> execution begins.<p>A <i>great</i> question is what the relative limitations are of both. I don't have a definitive answer, but I think this is one of the fundamental questions software engineering should attempt to answer - what abstractions can we build at compile-time, and what abstractions must be left for run-time?",1259706001

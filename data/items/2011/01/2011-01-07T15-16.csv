2079835,comment,2073551,2073937,0,0,ohyes,,,"> 1. Fact is, in your teens and early 20s your body can digest pretty much anything. Eat a bowl of cereal in the morning (and I mean something like oatmeal or raisin bran rather than some sugary crap) and it barely matters what else you eat (other than calorific content);<p>Can, vs. should. I'm 25 and already feeling my metabolism slow down. Working at a desk isn't helping matters. Your brain really does function better with proper nutrition and exercise.<p>>2. Eating the same thing every day gets real old real fast;<p>In my experience, I can eat the same thing for about a week before getting bored. Pizza and Ramen get pretty tired immediately, if you are used to real food.<p>> 3. There is an investment required in cooking in terms of equipment, etc;<p>How much $100 bucks? $300? You need a good pot, a good pan, a good knife, a cutting board, and some utensils (spoon, spatula, tongs?). Tupperware is also important.<p>> 4. Cooking takes time between shopping, cleaning and the actual cooking. That's time that could be better spent doing many other things.<p>I consider cooking downtime. I use it to ponder stuff, or to just think about work problems. Trying to make something new (to me, at least) that tastes good is a very interesting creative process. There is all of this interesting reflection about what certain things will take when they are cooked together in a certain way.<p>For me to cook, it takes 1 hour shopping, 1-2 hours cooking, 1/2-1 hour cleaning (once a week, sometimes twice). Cooking and cleaning can be pipelined, as a large chunk of cooking is waiting for something to simmer/boil/bake, and the kitchen sink is in the same room as the stove. I make enough food for a week.<p>> 5. Even getting something for lunch can be a huge time sink and minimally takes half an hour unless you're eating out of a hot dog stand right outside your office.<p>Stick whatever you made in the microwave; eat. you can still sit with your colleagues should you desire. Besides this, my best work is done cooking, showering, commuting (in my brain). The idea that you can (or should) be working all of the time (and still be sane, and normal), strikes me as odd.<p>The other night, for example, I made chicken simmered in a red wine and caper sauce with artichoke hearts, baby corn on spinach (seasoned-- I cant remember how). I did the chicken, artichoke, and baby corn in  a large pan, spinach in a pot. Most of the time investment was listening to my iPod waiting for things to be done. I ended up very self-satisfied (as I'm sure you can tell), and it tasted good, to boot. Ingredients were not expensive considering what I used, and what I got out of it.<p>Simmered chicken dishes are easy to do, so are stir-fry, stews, chili, soups, baked chicken, anything grilled (if you have a grill), black beans and rice is also very adaptable, meatballs are extremely easy (I like the McCormick seasoning packets). To boot, my girlfriend loves it when I cook for her, and it is a lot cheaper than taking her out to dinner (though I still take her out to dinner anyway).",1294415428

They have a basic service life of 20 years (as opposed to 3-5 for Li-ion) and can be stretched to 50 years with electrolyte replacement.  The battery tech is worked out, but investments in manufacture and economies of scale would enable market access to a technology with lower cost than Li-ion.

That's 14% of the world's population. That's huge. Being generous though, let's extend that 100% growth into the year after.

I'm the author of the article (Macco, thanks for submitting it!).<p>You're right that the $50B valuation isn't based on current numbers. It's based on what Facebook <i>might</i> be able to do in the future. Imagine you were buying a house. It's a great house, has a solid foundation, beautiful interiors, and is in an excellent neighbourhood that is constantly appreciating. Would you pay what it <i>might</i> be worth in 3 years, today?<p>I understand the argument about growth, but even from that end, it doesn't completely stand up. If we were to use the PEG Ratio (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEG_ratio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEG_ratio</a>), for Facebook to be fairly valued at $50B, it has to grow its Net Income by 100% annually, on average over the next five years.<p>It's possible Facebook might be able to do that next year, but then it'll have 1 billion users. That's 14% of the world's population. That's huge. Being generous though, let's extend that 100% growth into the year after. Then, Facebook would have 2 billion users, 28% of the world's population, and assuming current margins, they would only be eeking out $2 billion in profit.<p>Will it be worth $200 billion then? I would say no and I would say Facebook's not worth $50 billion now.",1294414514

It takes some of the convenience out of the fob, but it would still be somewhat easier than fiddling around with a physical key, though quite a bit of convenience is lost.<p>Another way would be to attach the key to something like a smartphone.  The car finds it location via GPS and stores it on a server somewhere.  If the fob receives a signal from what it thinks is the car, it asks the smartphone to confirm its location is near the car's location.  The fall-back in case the smartphone is out of battery or the car did not post its location would be this vulnerable method where the fob simply responds if it has received the message from the car.",1294413086

She taught me a great deal about liberty and censorship. She strongly believed that some books should not be carried in a children's library. She also strongly believed that books should not be revised: Either they were fit for the library or not.<p>I haven't asked her, but I suspect that she is fine with the original, and if she wasn't, she wouldn't be fine with the revision either.",1294412997

It's not just a simple matter of re-painting the runways: publications have to be changed, notices have to be issued, etc.  Changes would cascade out into literally every aspect of the aviation industry.",1294412848

Makes sense as GPS is not considered safe enough for main navigation, it's only here for additional help (in theory at least). Also traditional radio navigation (VOR, NDB) is done with magnetic directions. Changing runways directions happens sometimes, it's not such a rare event, as the north is moving on many parts of the globe (not everywhere the same though). I know of a few places here that have changed runway direction.<p>Anyway, it's not that much of a burden, because there is a very defined and safe process for updating airport and airspace data. When that type of change happens, udates are shipped over many channels that pilots should follow.",1294412476

218437,comment,218382,218396,0,0,mdakin,,,"I think there is a generalization here worth mentioning-- you need to understand what your contractor actually wants and figure out the best incentive for him.  For example I value being able to work multiple jobs at the same time and/or on my own stuff.  This implies when I give people a deal on a rate I give them a LOWER rate for the FIRST X hours and then the rate goes up after X.  The client is happy because he knows he's getting a deal for the first X hours but more hours are always available if needed albeit at a higher rate.  I try to make the average rate over 40 hours a slight deal for the client.  This strategy seems to make clients happy as they wind up with a real deal on the first X hours.  And I get diversity/freedom.  Everyone wins.",1213595947

218435,comment,218226,218329,0,0,breily,,,"It seems that downvotes would definitely decrease - I would bet that a large portion of them would not have been made in public.  If nothing else it might increase the number of replies to a post - It would be slightly embarrassing to see your name as one of the downvoters if you didn't also reply to the post.<p>Enabling downvotes on submissions could also be interesting - maybe to downvote a submission you have to comment about it or about why you downvoted it.  Revealing voting could add an additional feature to the site - if we see that someone who likes the same stuff voted something up, then we'll probably read it.",1213595763
218434,comment,218327,218327,0,0,gunderson,,,"I can't believe people are so caught up in the net-neutrality propaganda.<p>Most people could care less about net neutrality b/c they use their internet connection for some web surfing, file transfers, and generally fit within the usage pattern that made their ISP (acting as a bandwidth reseller/speculator) determine that the price should be around $60/month.<p>If you're one of the small percentage of users who wishes to use p2p software and soak up 100% of available bandwidth at all times, then you are not compatible with the bandwidth estimates that your ISP used to determine the price of your service.<p>The ISP has two choices, it can either make its basic plan very restrictive (for example, forcing everyone to use http through a proxy server and blocking everything else), or it can use more subtle -- LESS INVASIVE -- measures such as blocking p2p traffic or imposing a cap on the 1-2% of users who use 99% of the bandwidth.<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with this.  It's like moving into an apartment where the landlord offers ""free"" water service and filling up a tanker truck each day with the ""free"" water.  You would be violating the spirit of the agreement, and it would be reasonable for the landlord to be upset, or to change the policy.<p>Google wants net neutrality b/c it envisions a world in which http traffic could be modified (by non-neutral ISPs) to harm its ad network.  This is Google's big, scary, what-if that motivates its current stance.  Google also owns miles of dark fiber which could be used to do any of the non-neutral objectives Google may have, including offering all kinds of proprietary services over ""the googlenet"".",1213595645

If you don't, you are better off keeping data members public.<p>Of course, I really like how Python properties handle this, because the syntax is the same as if the accessor methods never existed.",1213595350

It's also new web apps, aggregators, wikis, mashups, and documentation.<p>Users also get to reuse their avatar/username across multiple sites which might encourage commenting.<p>It has good nested threading support which most blog software doesn't include for some psychotic reason.<p>It has good anti-spam which prevents you from needing akismet or defensio integration.<p>They support video comments now that most blogs won't support.<p>...<p>Currently, I'm debating adding it to bug.gd rather than adding new features to our own commenting system. Why reinvent the wheel if we have a tool that does it for us?<p>The only cons I see right away:<p>Loss of serch engine benefits of having the comment content hosted on someone else's site.<p>Risk to your site if it goes down.<p>I also wonder how it handles incredible traffic.",1213594727

On the other, it is true that many people with bright ideas do not go the startup route because they have family responsibilities or something similar that holds them back.<p>It's too simplistic to say that a social safety net will encourage entrepreneurship.  It will probably enable more people to start up companies, esp in the tech sector, but it will equally lead to more deadwood entering the system.",1213594377

But does anyone care to explain any more (in English, for us plebes) more about how this is astonishing? I'm not challenging the assessment; I'm just curious about what it means.<p>And some interesting words from one of the other papers: what are ""classifier regret"" and ""ranking regret""?

Even if you could not hire this person long term at least the person would be able to gain some experience and cash.<p>The problem with freelancers is that they have lots of overhead.  They may not have to pay a lot for equipment or a building but they have limited hours and many of those hours are spent doing non billable stuff.  The overhead is in the lost time keeping the business going.<p>A freelancer with a long term gig could lower rates a bit but many of those overhead items still remain.  Even with a long term contract a freelancer still has to do marketing, keep sending out invoices, ""maintain"" the clients and many other things that a non freelancer doesn't have to worry about.",1213593423

218410,comment,218382,218382,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"If he's fantastic and believes in what you're doing, what about bringing equity into the equation?<p>I ordinarily say, ""Contractors don't get equity.  End of discussion.""  But it sounds like money is tight, and you have deadlines to meet and/or goals to achieve that this person can help you achieve--that's what equity is for: The things that you can't get any other way.  If you can't afford him, then you can't get it in the normal manner.<p>The other option:  Trade equity to an investor for money--more than it takes to bring this person on board.  It's still giving up equity, but it'll probably buy you more in the long run.<p>Or, keep negotiating.  Rates are negotiable until one party gives a plain ol' ""No"".  If he isn't having to juggle jobs to make ends meet, he may be willing and able to work on your project in order to do something fun.  When I did contract work, I lowered my rate all the way down to 1/3 the normal rate to work on stuff I really liked.  And when I could no longer give them my full attention at those rates, I left the job and helped them in the process of hiring a replacement.",1213592955

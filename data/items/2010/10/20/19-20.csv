1812799,comment,1812227,1812644,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"I would personally place the blame squarely at Intel's feet. They no longer allow nVidia to make chipsets for Nehalem onwards, so instead of having a chipset with integrated graphics, you now have to have an additional chip on the motherboard for standalone graphics. In this form factor, that's just not an option.<p>I guess Apple could also be faulted for wanting to standardize on decent graphics, but I just can't bring myself to see that as anything but a good thing!<p>It will be interesting to see how this changes with time. Sandy Bridge, Intel's upcoming CPU release, has graphics on die, but it will still be vastly outclassed by the nVidia 320M that's in the new Air. Unless Intel comes along with vast improvements with their 22nm refresh, Ivy Bridge, Apple's still going to be in the same bind - in 2012.",1287604706

The battery is 7 to 11 hours. With their batteries in it it'd be even lighter than it is, most of the difference is right there.

However, the differences between mass storage media is most certainly a factor that authors of many applications need to consider. Capacity and performance characteristics are relevant in video editing, for example. Optical disc burning software must consider the quantity, performance, capacity, erasability, etc., of the drives (and discs) present -- and must deal with different driver interfaces as well.<p>The difference between graphics adapters is an extreme difference. Authors needing advanced graphics capabilities must be able to handle different capabilities (resolution of course, but also shaders, etc.), and in extreme cases, GPU code downloaded to the adapter. They may have to deal with different software interfaces (DirectX vs OpenGL). And the handling of multiple monitors is a common question these days.<p>Even CPUs, as glibly dismissed, have far more differences. For some kinds of applications the developer may need to deal with the presence of SSE2 or SSE3 instructions, for example.<p>There really is a tremendous amount of fragmentation in PC-compatible hardware.<p>And your reply about ""writing a device driver"" is, of course, part of the answer. When the variance is sufficiently important, developers create abstraction layers so that they don't need to worry about it -- that's the point of things like OpenGL or TWAIN.",1287603855

Apple really wants all of their machines to support OpenCL on the graphics chip.

For the i3/5/7 generation, Intel refused to let NVidia make chipsets. In order for Apple to get NVidia graphics in a laptop with an i3/5/7, they have to have the i3/5/7 CPU, an Intel chipset, and an NVidia graphics chip. The necessity of using 3 big, hot chips instead of two increases the parts costs, slightly increases the power consumption, makes cooling and motherboard design more complicated, and, in the case of the MacBook Air, they pretty much don't fit unless you make the machine thicker or use a smaller battery.<p>Until Intel can produce a decent graphics core or they decide to play nice with NVidia, ultraportables have to decide whether to have good graphics or the latest CPUs.

Will they change that with the OS X App Store?<p>The solution for this on iOS is the same as on Mac or Windows - release a new version. From 2.0 to 3.0, a lot of companies will charge for the update. Do the same thing on iOS by releasing a new app entirely. This also lets you fix bugs in the old version for users that don't want to update.<p>The only thing missing in that plan is an upgrade price.

Sure, one trained in electronics can look at a PCB and surmise its function - but for one not trained, they would do to understand what each section of that design does, and why it does it.  &quot;Why would part X be used in this design?  What is its function?&quot;<p>OSHW to me, is more enabling the long tail of invention.  To be fair, I think a lot of the users of OSHW development platforms are looking for the right combinations of components to make their software designs effective.  I see a lot of stuff out there that is little more than re-packaging of a dev kit in a cheaper to produce form, but with software that enables it to fulfill a new purpose.<p>So, yes, a lot of us do see OSHW as a meaningful activity with a meaningful outcome.  I&#x27;m sorry that you think it&#x27;s pointless for people to share their electronics designs (Sheesh, can&#x27;t everyone who wants to make something buy something else that does exactly that and copy it by looking at a board?) Truth be told, we could say the same thing about software: I can observe what it does given any specific input, therefore I could replicate it - who needs source code?!",1375753774

(in Italian; P.D.O. in English) certification symbol on the bottle [1, 2].  There&#x27;s a similar looking symbol if the produce is also organic.  This symbol means that inspectors have physically gone over the entire operation of the producers and checked it against a list of standards.<p>Other things to look for: the bottle says if it&#x27;s filtered or unfiltered (the unfiltered stuff has much more of a peppery kick), there is a production date, there is a best before date, it says that the oil has been cold-pressed and mechanically extracted, and there is an indication of the region of Italy that the olives come from.<p>I have never been disappointed by using this method, but of course not every good oil is certified.

Conservatively I would guess that we have 1-2 years of advantage over a startup when competing for the attention of large component suppliers. Just getting the lawyers on both sides to agree on a NDA can be a big production.<p>On the other hand, when a mega company joins up with another mega company, e.g. phone manufacturer and processor supplier, there&#x27;s a lot of risk aversion on both sides due to the large investments. There&#x27;s a crack in the system somewhere that small innovative companies can take advantage of but I don&#x27;t think open reference designs do much more than documenting the state of the art.

Feedstock is already commodified and I can&#x27;t really see anyone making a play on a printer/feedstock combo that required you buy only genuine branded feedstock.<p>The basic design tools ( Meshlab, Blender; etc.) are already free, but require real expertise to understand and use.<p>So the main market opportunities are going to be:<p>1. finding talented designers/architects/developers and matching them with the demand for design services.<p>2. parametric design adapters that can take a common set of parameters and produce an individualized design ( from clothing to buildings )<p>3. Assistive design tools; tools that help you realize your designs while ensuring that they remain within the bounds of manufacturability and are pleasing to the eye and hand; without requiring that you become an expert in whatever field you are dabbling in. ( Think of a jewelry design application that knows about both physics and proportion, and suggests alterations to you. Or a habitat builder that can show you a map of where mildew will happen in your design...) The basic premise of this class of application is that you could hand it to a bright fourteen year old and she could design a successful and functional instance of the target class of object.<p>If you&#x27;re hungry for good ideas; there&#x27;s a fairly rich vein of common items that people will want a customized version of, but won&#x27;t necessarily be wanting a bespoke or personal design.

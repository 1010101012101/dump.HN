We found YC about 3 months early, unfortunately, and are just now working on a demo to shop around for seed funding.<p>I'm going to be moving up sometime in January. If people want to get together and rent and apartment, I'd be really interested. I'm thinking a 3 bedroom, with bunk beds and the whole nine yards.<p>Also, just getting together and eating dinner and talking would be immensely helpful.<p>Is anyone interested? How can we organize this?<p>I've created a facebook group (hold the lynching mob please). <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=5381210911"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=5381210911</a>",1192813139

70382,comment,70382,70370,0,0,mrtron,,,"1) Starting small is often the best route to doing something big.  Starting small gives you the ability to complete something and not run out of steam along the way.\n2) Ideas don't need to be mind blowing, they need to be good and for them to work well in a business they need to be solving some sort of problem that will result in you getting paid.\n3) That could be a huge problem for your motivation.  Is there some subset of the idea that you could run with and think a little bigger than they currently are?<p>Finding the right co-founders is much harder than finding the right idea in my experience, so I think that is why the general YC motto is the idea doesn't matter nearly as much as the co-founders do.<p>Best of luck...\n",1192811508
70381,comment,70361,70374,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"I'm thinking more along the lines of brk's comment in getting comfortable with the demo part of the interview and the pitch - similar to what any startup (ourselves included) needs to practice constantly to get really good and essentialize the message based on how it is understood by others.  Removing as much of the stress element for interviewing is key for the founders to be able to focus on communicating about their team and plans - and getting comfortable in front of an audience is pretty important to prevent angst from interfering with the message.  It is no accident that Jobs practices for his presentations :)<p>We've decided that in addition to launching soon, we want to raise some money to build out our application faster - so we need the practice ourselves.",1192811292

Multiple real-life runs through your demo can help you get comfortable with it, and weed out the rough spots.<p>If anyone is interested, I work in Cambridge (not YC related), and have a fair bit of startup experience in many areas (biz dev, operations, sales, etc) and would be happy to preview demos and give pointers and honest feedback.",1192810255

And they want to work together.  But often the idea they want to work on isn't right.  Either:<p>1) I feel they're thinking too small.  They're incredibly talented people, but they want to pursue what I think is a really small market, and could be doing something more worthy of them.<p>2) We have different opinions on the business prospects for the idea - I think it's just OK, they think it's amazing.<p>3) The idea seems boring to work on, often because the idea is 95% marketing or content and not technology (e.g. a variant on an online store, blog, content site, etc.)  This is bad for motivation.<p>I have good ideas of my own, but it's hard to persuade people to change their mind once they've decided what they want to work on.  Since I'm not in school, I've had to work hard to find other good people (through a lot of networking) and it would be a shame not to do <i>something</i> with them,  So, should I move on and look for someone to buy into my own ideas, or start working with these talented friends of mine and hope to evolve their idea into something better?

Instead of typing out stuff again and again, people just use shortcuts and hackish solutions throughout the code. Due to Javas overly object oriented syntax transiting to another language proves quite a shock where not everything is an object. Javas verbosity also makes it difficult to 'think' in java. One bad practice that is quite common in java coders i have worked with is that they often just understand code x does y, but not why it does what it does. Due to its verbosity you also tend to make more mistakes while typing it out. Java itself is quite cool, but due too its style it is not suited as a first language.

Sure, they'd know you've sent <i>something</i> and they could break into your house to seize your computer but you either have truecrypted your hard drive previously or DBAN'ed your computer.<p>You could say that this is not a good thing because it allows someone to sell secrets to opposing countries.

A Metro version of Office, which does that, wouldn't that be great?<p>Furthermore, I don't want to tinker, I don't want to dig through five layers of settings.<p>I want to see the IT world going on.

But MS has to do a lot more to earn that credit. Maybe they have to cut some things out of the Metro side and go dual platform. It will help to make Metro something that pushes forward the whole industry.<p>When a lot of people are used to Win 8, maybe it's a good thing to go separate ways with Win 9.

4705895,comment,4701958,4702923,12,0,mbenjaminsmith,,,"Little late to the party here but you're wrong. Unless something is being done to the signal (eq, other processing, etc) then you want the digital side to remain at max volume (i.e., no reduction in bit depth). The audio will have been mastered close to 0 db with little or no clipping (exceeding the maximum amplitude possible) and should not be ""too loud"" for your amplifier. If it is there is something wrong with the gain configuration of your setup.<p>As discussed, lowering the volume in software (which is what you likely mean by ""controlling the DAC"") is accomplished by reducing bit depth. By definition you're reducing the amount of signal present which makes your S/N worse. If by ""controlling the DAC"" you mean reducing the signal at the DAC's analog stage then there's nothing theoretically wrong with that (except that it's rarely if ever the case in computer sound cards or hi-fi DACs) as it is the equivalent to adjusting the volume on your (integrated) amp.<p>Probably the most common exception to the above is people using a digital EQ to attempt to improve the sound of a mediocre computer audio setup. Most digital EQs allow for both ""boost"" and ""cut"" -- increasing or decreasing the amplitude of individual frequency bands. If you EQ the music the proper way you should only cut frequency bands in order to emphasize the other bands to suit your listening tastes. For example if you want to try to increase the amount of bass you should cut the mids and the highs and turn up the volume (on your amp) to compensate. EQing this way ensures that you're not forcing the signal into clipping by boosting too much.<p>You still won't get great results because if you're lacking bass or highs then it's most likely because you're not running full range speakers. If the sound does change when you EQ it's most likely due to increased distortion, not because you're appreciably increasing the amount of bass present. That's not true for full range speakers but if you have full range speakers you probably wouldn't need to EQ in the first place. (Full range speaker are usually 20 - 50hz to 20khz.)<p>If it's still not clear than think of it this way: Standalone CD players don't have volume controls. Their output will be ""max volume"" of what's on the CD. You can think of your computer and sound card like a (crappy) CD player. Make sure it's at max volume and adjust the level on your external amp or amplified speakers.",1351334748

The only saving grace is that many of these sites are pretty relevant to your site.

It seems using Apple products turn people into arrogant self-righteous snobs.<p>Sorry, but I don't want to become one of ""them"". I'm happy with my Surface and other Microsoft products.",1351332194

Atleast you must be somewhere near the top of the hierarchy where your subject is, to understand fully about them, so you can even <i>consider</i> writing about them. I fail to see how a guy with an app on an Appstore can think he is credible enough to write about a huge corporation that has taken risks he wouldn't even imagine taking himself and has had first hand experience and information about the market better than this guy. Microsoft is the one that makes the marketplace and Marco is just someone who submits his apps there. That's the difference in their positions in the hierarchy. What a shitty article.",1351332192

With type inference, they also allow less typing (""foo :="" instead of e.g. ""auto foo ="").<p>You are going a learn a completely new language, new idioms, new standard library, new tools, and you're arguing that switching to a different style of declarations, a very <i>very</i> minor detail, is ""less intuitive""? I'm not sure how intuition applies there: are you learning a language by trying to compile what you typed without reading any documentation or what?<p><i>Again the designers of Go could have implemented exceptions and let programmers choose what mechanism they prefer.</i><p>Because making them optional doesn't work well. If someone uses exceptions and someone not, combining code from those two people will make you use <i>both</i> exceptions and error returns. It would be even messier than indicating errors in C (does this function return 0 on error or -1 or what)?",1351332134

Assuming that the idea of private property ownership exists, I can&#x27;t think of any other coherent place for the profits to go, other than the owner.<p>Sometimes, a business might be an unexpected hit, taking off and generating revenues beyond the wildest dreams of the founder.   Suddenly the company is flush with cash. Now assuming all the employees are fairly compensated, and all the company&#x27;s other financial needs are met, then beyond a small buffer, what is there to do with the excess cash aside from paying it out as a dividend to the owner?<p>So I guess my point is that we can make moral hypotheticals all day (about whether it&#x27;s &quot;right&quot; for the owners of a profitable company to get &quot;free&quot; money &quot;forever&quot; without necessarily &quot;doing anything&quot; further), but I&#x27;m not sure what other system we could put in place within a capitalist framework. If a company is treating its employees well, meeting all needs, and still generating an operating surplus, where else would you have that money go, if not to the owners?<p>Also I think your use of the term &quot;rent-seeking&quot; here is incorrect. A business owner receiving &quot;passive&quot; (or at least &quot;not much active involvement&quot;) income from the business they own is kinda the antithesis of rent-seeking.<p>Rent-seeking behaviour is the attempt to increase your share of the wealth, by means other than generating additional wealth. When you&#x27;re the one who owns a profitable company, you&#x27;re the one generating that wealth.<p>The classic example of rent-seeking is someone installing a chain across a river that happens to run through their land, and then starting to charge people to pass through &quot;their&quot; bit of river. They add no value to the economy in doing this, no product is created nor any service rendered; they are simply extracting rents from river-users.<p>Another example might be when a company seeks to tilt laws/regulations in its favour (e.g. through lobbying), with the intention of increasing the share of the wealth without the business actually having to generate it. Just like the river, no additional wealth is generated as a result of this action: existing wealth is merely being redistributed (toward the rent-seeker) by government policy.<p>The key concept in rent-seeking being that wealth (the so-called &quot;rent&quot;) is being captured by a party (the rent-seeker) without them generating it.",1437590350

This way my scripts were basically safe in almost all circumstances.  Until I hit the crazy DB with huge tables and massively wide tables where my one transaction would trash the transaction log and tempdb and cause SQL to go FU and stop.  Ooops.

9931290,comment,9928904,9929245,0,0,kelseydh,,,"That was a really, really good read.  It&#x27;s worth highlighting the section where they describe the four conditions where unstructured groups grow effective:<p>1) It is task oriented. Its function is very narrow and very specific, like putting on a conference or putting out a newspaper. It is the task that basically structures the group. The task determines what needs to be done and when it needs to be done. It provides a guide by which people can judge their actions and make plans for future activity.<p>2) It is relatively small and homogeneous. Homogeneity is necessary to insure that participants have a &quot;common language&quot; for interaction. People from widely different backgrounds may provide richness to a consciousness-raising group where each can learn from the others&#x27; experience, but too great a diversity among members of a task-oriented group means only that they continually misunderstand each other. Such diverse people interpret words and actions differently. They have different expectations about each other&#x27;s behavior and judge the results according to different criteria. If everyone knows everyone else well enough to understand the nuances, these can be accommodated. Usually, they only lead to confusion and endless hours spent straightening out conflicts no one ever thought would arise.<p>3) There is a high degree of communication. Information must be passed on to everyone, opinions checked, work divided up, and participation assured in the relevant decisions. This is only possible if the group is small and people practically live together for the most crucial phases of the task. Needless to say, the number of interactions necessary to involve everybody increases geometrically with the number of participants. This inevitably limits group participants to about five, or excludes some from some of the decisions. Successful groups can be as large as 10 or 15, but only when they are in fact composed of several smaller subgroups which perform specific parts of the task, and whose members overlap with each other so that knowledge of what the different subgroups are doing can be passed around easily.<p>4) There is a low degree of skill specialization. Not everyone has to be able to do everything, but everything must be able to be done by more than one person. Thus no one is indispensable. To a certain extent, people become interchangeable parts.<p>----<p>You could actually apply a lot of these principles to software teams, particularly the need for open communication between everyone.  When I see projects not doing this I often find their effectiveness drop too.",1437588544

The idea is that you have a copy of an initialized transaction program in a ready to run state, and when a transaction comes in, it&#x27;s attached to a copy of the program and executed.<p>This approach comes in two flavors - in one, each transaction gets a fresh copy of the program.  In the other, the program is used over and over unless it aborts, in which case a new clean copy is loaded and used. This corresponds to CGI and FCGI under Apache.<p>Programs which run as transactions have to be prepared for some unusual events.  Time, for example, suddenly jumps forward when a stored transaction program starts.  File and network connections have to be connected to the right things. Stateful connections, as with databases, may not play well with this approach. This can work well when the program doesn&#x27;t have that much live state when the transaction program is frozen.  A program that has a lot of startup overhead related to getting external resources may not be a good candidate.   Unfortunately, those are the ones for which this is the biggest win.<p>If the main program is program loading overhead, as in Python and Java, maybe the solution is to go hard-compiled.  C, C++, Go, and Rust are hard-compiled, and you can even hard-compile Java with GCC.  Python and Javascript don&#x27;t have that option.<p>(Nightmare of the future - precompiled Javascript snapshot blobs loaded into browsers.)",1437588455

The current rate of warming is faster now than at any time in the last 11,000 years [1], and it may occur faster than any climate change which has occurred in the last 65 million years [2], current rates of warming are substantially faster than that at the end of an ice age [3], and CO2 levels are currently higher than at any point within the last 800,000 years [4].<p>It is important to understand that these issues will have real impacts on real people in the immediate future, and being optimistic on the scale of geological time is absurdly detached from a day to day reality.<p>Climate change, biodiversity loss, and ocean acidification will have serious impact on the immediate time scale, and are largely unprecedented in the geological time scale.<p>[0] <a href=""http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/corals/coral04_reefs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/corals/coral04_r...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/03/13/global_warming_new_study_shows_warming_is_faster_than_it_has_been_in_11.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/03/13/global_w...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/august/climate-change-speed-080113.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/august/climate-change-spe...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/pd/climate/factsheets/iscurrent.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/pd/climate/factsheets...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/04/09/3424704/carbon-dioxide-highest-level/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/04/09/3424704/carbon-d...</a>",1437588257

9931238,comment,9930097,9930930,0,0,josu,,,"While I understand the point you are making, I would argue that the textile industry is a necessary evil for many countries. It&#x27;s pretty well explained in this article:<p>>According to the comprehensive “Ashgate Companion to the History of Textile Workers,” a study of 21 countries over 350 years, nearly every nation suffered through its T-shirt phase differently. Argentina’s brutal encomienda system literally worked indigenous laborers to death. The Hapsburg monarchy’s T-shirt phase coincided with its own collapse. Japan’s progress was slowed by a world war; Germany’s was all but destroyed by two. New England’s textile workers had it relatively good; if conditions didn’t improve, they could threaten to leave for the frontier.<p>>All these countries, however, experienced the same broad phenomenon. Lex Heerma van Voss, an editor of the “Ashgate Companion,” told me that the T-shirt phase lasts only as long as there are large populations of farmers with few options. This is known as a “race to the bottom.” Factory owners compete by offering low prices, which are accomplished by paying workers tiny wages. Cutting costs by a few pennies per shirt may sound trivial, but mass-market brands find that even a slight increase in price destroys demand. And those pennies at wholesale become dollars at retail.<p>>But once the factories have absorbed all these desperate farmers, they need to find a new competitive advantage. That usually involves making better products. When the T-shirt phase ends, a “race to the top” usually begins. Factories often shift to finer clothes, like dress shirts, which require skilled workers. This phase often involves the growth of unions and rising wages. It’s typically followed by one in which factory owners, forced to pay more, seek out ever more profitable lines of business. That can mean the move to low-end electronics assembly, then auto plants and maybe even airplane manufacturing. At the high end of the spectrum, you begin to see what the U.S. manufacturing economy is going through now — expensive products, like medical devices, which are often made by machines that are operated by highly skilled workers.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/magazine/economic-recovery-made-in-bangladesh.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/magazine/economic-recovery...</a><p>As long as there is no slave work, this is, people are working in these factories &quot;voluntarily&quot;, it may be the best option they have. These are people maximizing their utility and deciding to work for USD50-200/month with 6 day weeks and 12 hour days. Yes, it sucks, and I wish they had other options, but I&#x27;m not sure that boycotting F21 would work in their favor. As the article sadly states, this seems like a necessary phase.",1437588125

9931232,comment,9931121,9931170,0,0,tptacek,,,"Funding rounds dilute preexisting investors. One of the possible terms in an investment contract are pro-rata rights for investors, giving them the right during future financing rounds to invest more money to maintain their percentage ownership. Thus an early seed investor who gets 5% of the company for 500k can ensure they retain 5% of the company in the A and B rounds, so long as they&#x27;re willing to fork over the cash for the top-up shares at the A and B round valuations.<p>This is an important part of VC strategy. VCs invest in, say, 10 companies, expecting 8 to fail outright. The 2 winners need to make up for the 8 losers. But the investor can&#x27;t see into the future to figure out which are the 2 winners. Pro-rata rights give them some optionality: by the time the A round happens, it&#x27;ll be clearer to the investor whether they should have plowed more money into that company, and pro-rata lets them do that.<p>The problem for YC is that each YC batch has 30-50 companies in it, most of which will fail. When those companies go to raise later rounds, new investors want to know whether YC believes in them. If YC exercises pro-rata rights on just some of their companies, the ones that don&#x27;t see the exercise are damaged goods. So instead, YC is committing themselves to pro-rata <i>all</i> their companies (this is a lot of companies) so long as they can afford it.",1437588076

I found out about it because T-Mobile was heavily advertising it on their website.  So I tried to sign up.  You can&#x27;t do that; you have to either order a SIM card from them (which is free), or get one from Walmart.  I tried to get a SIM card from the local T-Mobile store.  They don&#x27;t sell those.  I ordered a SIM card online and had to wait a week.  When it arrived, I activated it on (surprise!) the T-Mobile website.  I guess you can do that after all.<p>Note that in ordering the SIM card I did not indicate that I wanted any particular plan.  The $30 plan just &quot;happened&quot; to be available for that card.<p>Was I willing to wait for one week in order to lower the bill for a large recurring cost by 40%? Yes.

6526874,comment,6524385,6526428,3,0,bodhi,,,"> Well, there are programming languages and then there are conventions. I think a programming language is more like an alphabet, and programming conventions are the real languages.<p>I like this. As a thought experiment, consider the idea of transforming a convention into another &quot;letter&quot; in the alphabet. A simple example would be the natural numbers. If our alphabet is &quot;a&quot;, then we can represent 1 as &quot;a&quot;, 2 as &quot;aa&quot;, 3 as &quot;aaa&quot;, and so on (unary). If we expand our alphabet with a &quot;b&quot;, then we basically have binary. And in the case of &quot;aaaaaaaa&quot;, &quot;baaa&quot; is a an improvement. But there will be a an optimal point somewhere, where the load of expanding the alphabet is greater than the benefit of the more compact representation. This explains to a small extent why we (programmers) use hex, and didn&#x27;t really go to higher bases (digits + alpha could get us to base 36!)<p>The analogy starts to fall apart when we think about the ability to add to the alphabet, <i>using the conventions</i>. We can&#x27;t invent new letters, but we can create/repurpose words that encapsulate a lot of meaning.<p>I&#x27;m not really sure where I was going with this anymore!<p>> I can scroll through code at high speed and understand it at a mere glance once I &quot;get&quot; both the language and the convention that was used.<p>The issue for me is that the boilerplate is noise. I don&#x27;t want to see the similar parts, I want to see the parts that differ. Pseudo-C example:<p><pre><code>    x = [1,2,3,4,5]

    product = 1
    for (int i = 0; i < x.length; i += 1) {
      product *= x[i]
    }

    sum = 0
    for (int j = 0; j < x.length; j += 1) {
      sum += x[j]
    }

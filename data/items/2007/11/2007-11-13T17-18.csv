There are lots of ways to achieve that through skill and hard work.  But the billionaire path is being on the multi-millionaire path, having an extremely rare opportunity serendipitously present itself to you, recognizing it, and then making a long series of good decisions without any major missteps.  There is a lot on that path you have not control over.  Talent, effort, and even wisdom are probably not enough to keep you on it by themselves.",1194976147

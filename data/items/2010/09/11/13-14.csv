1681552,comment,1681367,1681367,0,0,DavidMcLaughlin,,,"The funny thing about the ""instant"" search is around the time of AJAX exploding four or five years ago, this type of ""real-time"" search was all the rage. Over time it disappeared, most likely because it both wastes resources and a lot of users found it annoying. From that, auto-complete suggestions was the next evolution. Now we seem to have gone full circle. As impressive as it is that they're handling way more searches than before with lightning speed, the whole thing seems really naff. The marketing video for Google Instant in particular is hilarious - ""I don't even have to press Enter!""<p>I work for Nokia and we used to have ""real-time search"" on Ovi Maps and this was removed around a year ago, again due to a confusing and poor user experience. After all this buzz I saw some people on the internal communication tools ask if we have the technology internally to do instance geosearch.<p>Marketing is everything.",1284212841

1681527,comment,1681154,1681154,0,0,mawhidby,,,"I'm not really sure why the OP says that the Master's has more coursework than the PhD. At least in my Master's program at UMD, the PhDs have to take the same amount of classes as the Master's students. The only difference is that in the Master's, after you're done with your classes, you either write a thesis or a scholarly paper (for non-thesis based), and you're done. If you're a PhD student, you finish your classes, then you spend the next few years working on research towards your dissertation.<p>He might be referring to more work for an MS Comps, which is the non-thesis Master's. Instead of writing a thesis (which counts as 6 credit hours) you have to take 30 credit hours worth of classes, and half of those classes must be ""MS Comps,"" where at least 50% of your grade in a class (at least here at UMD) must come from exams. I am doing a thesis-based Master's, so I guess you could say I am able to take all my classes just as a PhD student would - in that in most classes there is a research project due at the end of the semester on a topic of your choosing. This allows you to shape the course to your liking and interests.<p>For me, being a Master's student has afforded me just as many research opportunities as a PhD student; I just won't be here as long.",1284211881

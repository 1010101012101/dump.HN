A person, that might not be able to tell the story that Steve Jobs embodies. And connected to that the brand will not be what is it today.<p>The second part of the scenario is, that the overall penetration with Apple related products will simply get too high someday.

My question is: ""Will it help?""<p>It's not enough to rush into a disaster with good intentions and hope. I'm trying to measure the feesability, practicality, and impact of this project. Would building and donating hundreds of Geiger counters for the people of Fukushima and the surrounding areas make a significant impact? Is there a need that isn't filled by surplus army electronics? What level of accuracy is necessary for a Geiger counter to be useful for detecting contamination? Even if most people wouldn't be in danger from nuclear radiation, is the comfort that a Geiger counter would provide in assuring their safety worth the resources that would be expended on making them?<p>Thanks for your time, Hacker News.

I also use the new ""private groups"" on Facebook a lot.<p>(I just tried to show a link to the ""private groups"" feature on Facebook, and that proved to be very frustrating. It took me a while of thrashing around with Facebook's help feature--after first trying Google, ahem--to find the main page about Facebook groups<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/groups</a><p>to show those of you who haven't tried them before. The private groups posting interface differs in some weird ways from the usual posting interface on wall posts and private messages, as typing ""Enter"" instantly posts the message, and the only way to form paragraphs in text is to type Shift-Enter, which is especially confusing for Mac users.)<p>It will be interesting to make the comparison between a new Google offering and Facebook. Any product or service that offers social interaction has to help each user build a network among the user's friends. Buzz was a big fail that way, as most of my friends immediately decided not to use it, but perhaps something new from Google will be more successful. My friends are all smart enough to know how to bail out of the second-best network if something better than Facebook comes along.",1300039646

Saying you 'circled' someone sounds odd, since it's not quite accurate. 'in your circle' vs 'in my circle' is kind of clunky compared to 'following me' or 'I follow'.<p>They don't offer anything related to groups of friends, though.

How do we keep social-media communities intelligent and informative? How do we prevent them from being constantly trolled, dominated by sugar-coated memetic fluff (e.g. ""things on fire""), spammed by marketers, or deliberately hijacked by paid sockpuppets, fanatical propagandists, and well-funded PR campaigns? We go on and on about this stuff, routinely.<p>But on the other hand, we worry about these things because they are important, and because we still haven't done enough. Especially in the USA, our failed media infrastructure is a <i>very big</i> problem. It creates an environment where everyone is either perpetually ignorant or perpetually afraid, or both, and it fuels random acts of sabotage and irrationality, and it serves as a constant drag on our civilization's energy. So when, as an engineer, I think about ways to advance my favorite design and engineering projects - smart civic design, renewable energy, robotic exploration of space, cheap and widespread applied genetics, popular appreciation of science, promotion of the creative arts - it always seems to come down to education and information. Here we have an example: Why, in a world where we can build a global information system like this one, must patio11, with obvious reluctance, spend so much time restating the obvious? (And, indeed, he <i>must</i> spend this time, because the alternative is that many of our friends, and relatives, and <i>especially</i> our parents run around like Chicken Little.)",1300039237

It's clearly not desired, but the technology apparently isn't there yet to do away with it.  I just found it so neat that such an apparent flaw is kept in the product because even with it, it's a ""good enough"" experience.  If I imagine myself on the team making Kindle, I think I might find it unacceptable that the screen flashes on every page turn.<p>Aside from that, the first Kindle had some sort of really awesome scrolling mirror thing on the right.

Rails may not be your thing even if Ruby is.<p>It's probably not the <i>best</i> way to learn Ruby, but the most fun way is definitely reading _why's poignant guide[1]. It's awesome and teaches you pretty well (you can find PDFs and such out there too).<p>Once you're satisfied with your command of Ruby:<p>I'm not really sure what the best way to get started is. I think RailsGuides[2] is supposed to be pretty good. The ""getting started"" page looks good and complete. When I started, the first thing I did is read the very-introductory parts of the Pragmatic Programmers' book[3], which is great. I didn't bother with the whole thing, just got the basics from it and then learned by doing, occasionally referring to it.<p>Once I read a few chapters of the pragprog book, I looked at official rails docs (I think it was guides.rubyonrails.org, but that site has evolved a lot since then), got started with something pretty simple, and googled if I had any trouble. For specific issues like getting exceptions, the api documentation[4] can be pretty useful. Though really, you should use apidock.com/rails because it's way more searchable (it's the same docs, plus some comments that apidock users have added, they just made a better search and made it less ugly).<p>Also, if Rails isn't doing it for you (especially if you <i>do</i> love Ruby), take a look at Sinatra and Padrino. There's of course way more plugins out there for Rails, but you can still use any gems (libraries), and it can be less annoying than Rails.<p>I'm not sure of any good ways to get used to MVC thinking. It wasn't that hard for me to get used to. What's the issue when it comes to MVC? Not sure where to put which code?<p>1: <a href=""http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/</a><p>2: <a href=""http://guides.rubyonrails.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/</a><p>3: <a href=""http://pragprog.com/titles/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pragprog.com/titles/rails4/agile-web-development-with...</a><p>4: <a href=""http://api.rubyonrails.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.rubyonrails.org/</a><p>EDIT: Forgot to mention that railscasts.com has awesome screencasts on all kinds of topics.<p>I also forgot to mention that restful_authentication is really old.

I figured it was about as important as a folder for css and a folder for scripts. But MVC is the core structure of how rails operates, so it is super important.<p>A friend of mine who is a rails developer helped me immensely by describing MVC as<p>Model - Anything that describes the structure of your data and interacts with the database<p>View - The layout and display of the page<p>Controller - gets the data from the model and passes it to the view.<p>I didn't bother with a 'restful' gem, as rail3 (which I decided to learn with) is already restful, so I'm not sure what that gem would have done for you. But it is true, some Gems won't work, I think that is just the way things are with Rails and Python due to different versions, and they being younger languages (though this can happen with PHP packages also I think, I never really used many of them).<p>I also dove in head first and went with MongoDB with MongoMapper, which I wanted to learn anyway, instead of using mysql and ActiveRecord.<p>The railscasts are actually quite good, though I actually learned by creating a twitter clone \n<a href=""http://teachmetocode.com/screencasts/creating-a-twitter-clone-in-rails-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://teachmetocode.com/screencasts/creating-a-twitter-clon...</a>\nThe tutorial wasn't flawless, but I am using MongoDB and Rails3, so I wasn't expecting it to work perfectly, but I eventually got it all working.<p>Part of my challenge with Ruby was that it seemed to do SO much for me that I didn't understand what it was doing, but it kinda worked. Then when I wanted to make changes, I didn't know enough about what it was doing to get it to work.<p>As far as Heroku, I'm yet to actually release a rails app, so I haven't even tried that. I decided to learn Rails because it seemed like every developer I've teamed up with over the past year has been a ruby dev person, and I figured it's easier for me to learn their language and add to my quiver than get them programming in PHP which some of them knew, but didn't really like.<p>After using Ruby, I can't say that I'm a complete convert, as I think I could still get much done in PHP at about the same pace, but I think we're moving into a rails world.<p>MVC does make sense when you get used to it.\nBest of luck.",1281746690

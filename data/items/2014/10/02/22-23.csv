8403567,comment,8402184,8402184,5,0,dozy,,,"I once worked for Pyxis Mobile (now Verivo Inc.) which touted a platform which would provide you with native iOS, Android, and BlackBerry (years ago..) apps, which would <i>build themselves</i> at run time based on a database/app meta data. This allowed apps to completely change themselves without a resubmission, while being in-line with Apple&#x27;s guidelines, and technically be purely native. Between lazy loading and the fact that the interfaces were simple, the system worked well.  Point being - I&#x27;ve thought a lot about and seen the result of the &quot;avoid app store submission&quot; value proposition.<p>After all these years, I find the aforementioned value proposition...not that valuable. In my experience it&#x27;s fine to only be able to push iOS updates on something like a once/week cadence. Of course on Android, you can push daily if you really want to.<p>Ultimately, my thought is that with all of the complications and hard work required to create and maintain a mobile app, this is a tiny piece, and should play little into your decision when choosing to develope natively vs. w/ Meteor/phonegap vs. something else. Of course, the geek in me and the Android fanboy in me loves skirting Apple&#x27;s &quot;guidelines&quot;. :)",1412290716

The biggest one is that Synergy is going to get the bad press when users Google &quot;free synergy download&quot; and download the first random binary they come across, which could contain anything. Those users are going to complain &quot;Synergy gave me a virus&quot; or &quot;the installer crashes&quot; or whatever else and hurt the reputation of the project.

First off, of course a company like SpaceX requires a lot of money to do anything, that&#x27;s the nature of a company that needs to produce and operate manufactured goods, there isn&#x27;t the same cost floor as with digital goods (which is now practically zero).<p>More importantly, the goal of SpaceX is fundamentally the colonization of Mars, and the idealized method to do that is a fully reusable interplanetary spacecraft. If SpaceX had tried to build that and only that from their start they would have rapidly ran out of money, even $100 million, and had little to show for it. Instead they bootstrapped their way toward acquiring the capability to design, build, and operate such things while also building a corporation capable of funding such operations. Initially they built a small orbital launch vehicle, just barely at the limit of market feasibility, using very conventional technologies and very conventional designs, applying innovation peace-meal where it made sense. Even then it took them several tries to get a launch vehicle that worked, and it wasn&#x27;t even very competitive in the launch market. But it proved that SpaceX was capable of building launch vehicles, which enabled them to get grants and contracts to build a launch vehicle that was.<p>It wasn&#x27;t a demo or a prototype, the Falcon 1 was a fully functional &quot;MVP&quot;. And it wasn&#x27;t investment funding that got them to the next stage, it was effectively pre-orders for the next generation of their product. Then you look at what they&#x27;ve done since, they&#x27;ve built iteratively, advancing toward their goal, but even now they still haven&#x27;t gotten everything into place that they need. They&#x27;re still working on partial reusability, still working on manned spacecraft, still working on clustered core staging, and so on. But even so they have viable products that are bringing in a lot of revenue, with new products coming online soon that will bring in even more revenue. They are still several iterations and many years away from their goal but by the time they get there they&#x27;ll have the expertise, experience, and revenue to actually make it happen.<p>As with most endeavors, it&#x27;s almost always easier and better to get to a big goal iteratively. That&#x27;s how you build skill, it enables you to sell your earlier iterations to maintain revenue to keep your company alive, and each iteration provides lessons which inform the next and can reshape the grand idea you once had.",1412290298

(You should be doing this anyway.)<p>This is more like how bluetooth works. However that still leaves significant problems for HIDs. The only solution I see is remote attestation and securing the comms channel with encryption.<p>Even if USB is patched like this it doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of having un-trusted peripherals or appliances. For example, would you trust that the signed firmware for a USB scanner is actually secure? It is quite easy for a scanner driver to be subject to a buffer overflow caused by data from the scanner. Scanner embedded malware could be triggered by scanning a specific form, or anywhere it sees interesting text, like &#x27;SECRET&#x27; headers on a page.

Learning what 2+2 is useful, but because adding 2 to another small number, including itself, is something you do a lot.<p>Addition/times tables are great because the scope of numbers is something you will run across a lot of day to day.

If we don&#x27;t make the decisions, someone else will, and it matters for things like how we respond to acts of terrorism, road safety laws, funding for the treatment of diseases, and so on. And ignoring the moral weightiness of the decisions doesn&#x27;t remove the consequences or our responsibility for ourselves as a society.<p>> On a personal note, I don&#x27;t believe in this &quot;removal of empathy&quot; idea that&#x27;s been tossed around by a few psychologists. If psychopaths are effectively those people who lack empathy, then who shall we become if we throw it to the wayside?<p>The author suggested that cultivating compassion for others without choosing to imagine the experience of suffering their pain may be a better way to help other people. He uses some examples of Buddhists who choose to devote their lives to helping other people--they avoid experiencing empathic attachment because it burns them out, which would defeat their entire purpose. So if we throw empathy to the wayside, we might become more like Buddhist monks, if you want to read into it that way. The author proposes moderation more than extremes one way or the other, though; he recognizes that some degree of empathy is health in relating to other people.<p>Anecdotally, I agree with the author&#x27;s perspectives because of my own experiences. For the past year I had a close family member who was hospitalized and continuously in pain. It was really impossible to allow myself to empathize strongly with her every time I saw her, because it would have been too psychologically exhausting to continue visiting on a regular basis.",1412288611

The tokenization specification has a whole section on what identification and verification should be taking place to ensure the &quot;primary account number&quot; (credit card number) that the payment token is replacing is one the user has authorization for.<p>So let&#x27;s focus on the &quot;stores and charges&quot;.  Yes, Google stores and charges your primary account number.  This is just because Google happens to be the one doing the payment processing.\nEven in a token based system, again, somebody <i>on the other side</i> knows what real primary account number (credit card number) this token links back up to so they know what to subtract money from.  The token based stuff is not an full anonymization protocol, it&#x27;s mainly a way to securely avoid transmitting and storing credit card info to/by random merchants.  In <i>that</i> respect, the virtual credit card numbers provide the same protection. They are one time use, and interception or storage by the merchant can not harm you.\nSecondarily, the payment tokens are also a way to reduce the number of networks your credit card number goes over, when used properly.  The virtual credit card numbers perform the same function here too.<p>The person who knows in either system is usually your payment processor (though in case it isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s possible for the tokens to be used there too.  however, nothing in Apple Pay currently guarantees <i>this</i> happens with the tokens). Since that is google here, it makes sense they would have the primary account data to do the lookup.<p>If you are expecting tokens to replace credit card numbers all the way to the issuing bank, you are sorely mistaken. The lookup happens much earlier than that.<p>The TL;DR is that virtual credit card numbers are in fact, a method of tokenization.  The only reason they went with &quot;token&quot; is because they don&#x27;t have to be credit card numbers, and because not all virtual credit card implementations have the same guarantees.<p>In any case, if you want fully tokenized systems, those have existed too, just not en masse.",1412288480

They found one in particular, involving a substance called kynurenine that accumulates in human and animal bloodstreams after stress. Kynurenine can pass the blood-brain barrier and, in animal studies, has been shown to cause damaging inflammation in the brain, leading, it is thought, to depression.<p>But in the mice with high levels of PGC-1alpha1, the kynurenine produced by stress was set upon almost immediately by another protein expressed in response to signals from the PGC-1alpha1. This protein changed the kynurenine, breaking it into its component parts, which, interestingly, could not pass the blood-brain barrier.</i><p>I imagine this is hardly the whole story, but it is interesting that they were able to identify a specific component. Something else that I would think is relevant is that the lymphatic system is dramatically sped up during exercise. It is pumped by you working your muscles rather than by your circulatory system, even though it is kind of part of your circulatory system (because lymph is basically fluid from the blood but with major blood components removed).

At least according to <i>Training for the New Alpinism</i>, Zone 2 is the best place for cardio training. [1] Per that book, however, novices don&#x27;t train there because they share your belief. Zone 2 doesn&#x27;t feel like intense work, so novices think they are doing something wrong when they train in that zone.<p><i>something that you need to learn to love</i><p>Nah. It isn&#x27;t like brussel sprouts (IMO). I don&#x27;t think I will ever grow to love the exercises I hate, and the exercises I enjoy I have enjoyed since day one.

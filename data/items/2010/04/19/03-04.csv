In their own FAQ, the designers admit that the machine is not road legal in any of their target markets - their solution is to ask prospective customers to lobby for a change in the law. Even if they completely redesign the machine to be road legal, you'll still need a driving license, road tax and a helmet to ride it; you might as well buy a motor scooter, which will be cheaper, faster, more comfortable and safer.<p>Other than that, it's a great idea.<p>Honestly, this sort of thing makes me genuinely angry. It's a blatant example of the cart leading the horse, a designer starting from a blank page and ending up with a solution that is novel, exciting and far worse than all the existing solutions. It's exactly the kind of humbug that will result in more design awards than units sold. The bicycle is for the most part a solved problem. The non-folding bicycle was perfected over a hundred years ago and the folding bicycle has scarcely improved since the Brompton was launched in 1989.<p>The market is polarised into bicycles and motorbikes for a reason. If you add motive power and fuel to a bicycle, you end up with a machine too heavy to comfortably carry. Once you're over that threshold, it makes no difference at all whether you go 1kg over or 100kg over. You might as well use the extra weight and build a proper motor vehicle. Trying to bridge the imaginary gap between a bicycle and a motorbike makes perfect engineering sense but no practical sense.

Together, our partners have already sold over 100,000 EnergyHub-powered devices, and soon we will be managing 1 million devices.<p>Our easy-to-use web/mobile apps help people save money by, for example: figuring out the most efficient time to run your heat or AC; using geofencing to turn things down when you&#x27;re not home; and providing customized tips to help guide your decisions. We also run critical parts of the Smart Grid by linking our thermostat customers to Demand Response programs in the US and Canada.<p>You will have the opportunity to work on all aspects of the software: web and mobile applications, the distributed back end system including the communication layer to connected thermostats, analytics that drive efficiency, and the tools that we use. We use modern tools, and we&#x27;re open to trying out new technologies, languages, and ideas.<p>To apply, please send your resume and a brief note about why you&#x27;re interested in EnergyHub to josh at energyhub.net.",1417453174

Have a wage that barely pays the fuel and monthly expenses, with a variable bonus attached to the amount of successful deliveries per day.<p>Since they are not to blame for people not being at home, they try to deliver the packages to just about anyone in the neighbourhood, thus leaving a information to collect at place X, not always the post office.<p>There was an undercover story about this a couple of years ago, done by a famous German reporter, Günter Wallraff.<p>Maybe this situation today is different and has improved a lot, but this was how it used to be from the newspapers info.",1417453172

People who don&#x27;t know anything about economics tend to do that.<p>The &quot;problem&quot; of exponential growth is the belief that it will result in using up all available resources rather than finding more efficient ways to use resources we didn&#x27;t even know we had. Engines become more efficient, power generation becomes lower cost, food production moves from farms to factories... all of these are good things. We feed the world with far fewer resources today than we did a century ago when many more people were starving, even while we use more resources building smartphones and sending spacecraft out to explore the solar system. We solve problems our ancestors didn&#x27;t have because they still hadn&#x27;t solve the problems they faced.<p>Economically, exponential growth is required to keep the monetary system stable, but in human terms we live in a world where new problems always arise, and require new solutions.<p>Before Watt and Newcomb we didn&#x27;t have many problems related to steam power. Before the Wrights getting to the airport was just not an issue for most people. Human invention creates new problems which human invention solves, and that is a treadmill we cannot get off.<p>Capital markets turn out to be a remarkably good method of funding new solutions, and private enterprise turns out to be a remarkably good way of exploring the landscape of new solutions. No one has ever been able to figure out how to incentive socialist managers to explore that landscape with anything like the same efficiency--particularly given the opportunities they have for corruption--and when you look at how inefficient capitalism is you&#x27;ll realize that&#x27;s saying something.<p>So we continue to press on, while a certain type of person who has been more-or-less loud in the past two hundred years shouts at us that it is all going to end badly Real Soon Now.<p>Somehow it never does. It could, certainly, but we&#x27;re centuries away from that. Possibly millennia. In the short term, if the naysayers are so sure of their analysis, I recommend they apply it to the stock market and use their impressive prescience to get rich. It shouldn&#x27;t be difficult for anyone who has the kind of deep insight into the workings of the world that they claim to have to manage that.",1417453138

Getting themselves into a position of significant dependence on a SaaS provider can be unappealing for at least two reasons, even if the pricing works for them initially: 1. risk that the pricing gets raised significantly, or the business&#x27;s employee/customer profile changes in a way that raises the price to them significantly; or 2. risk that the SaaS provider goes out of business, is acquired, pivots, or otherwise significantly changes the service.<p>Building something in-house probably doesn&#x27;t usually result in a better product up front (and <i>definitely</i> not for less up-front expenditure), but it can reduce some risks and be less constraining to future moves if you own the app.",1417453132

8682114,comment,8681887,8681887,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"I think the issue with Glass is that when it started out, it appeased to our inner sci-fi geekiness of wearable technology that can do it all all without lifting a single finger. However, two years onward and nothing but a prototype running an unsupported and outdated chip, I can see the criticism being levelled at Google Glass.<p>Will switching to Intel hardware and adding in a few missing pieces of functionality be enough to save Glass? Who knows. For something like Glass to succeed, you need to have the support of developers who will write the apps and drive adoption, but it seems Google are fighting a losing battle at present to get developers to stay or new developers to enter the fray. There is just no incentive at the moment for people to care about Glass. I think Google needs to make its intentions clear, there is too much uncertainty and I think that is what is holding Glass back, perhaps even killing it. At present the perspective of many is Glass is just another Google experiment that can get cancelled at any time.",1417453101

Sure, the math is explicitly identical, but the modern concepts of operators on vector fields that is so powerful just didn&#x27;t exist which, to me, is rather telling about the evolution mathematical thinking: we are all doing the same thing (and have been for a long time) but way we think about it evolves with our notation.

8682075,comment,8679394,8681876,0,0,vdaniuk,,,"I totally agree with you but I feel that our discussion is missing a crucial detail here. A bit of philosophical and cultural theory.<p>Did you notice how lots of people after the movie were like &quot;Wow, I&#x27;ve got an epiphany, I&#x27;ve understood something.&quot; Did that something was about physics? No. It was about philosophy.<p>And damn, Interstellar philosophy is awful. Postmodernism at its worst.<p>Happy to share why.<p>Postmodernism is deeply suspicious of academia and academics. Who were the negative characters? Dr. Mann(&quot;the best of us&quot;) and Prof. Brand. &quot;Do not go gentle in the dying light&quot; A poem written for the poet&#x27;s father losing his vision. Who was his father? Literature professor.<p>Postmodernism rejects reason as a epistemological foundation and states that rationalism is just another narrative. Who was right about the planet? Amelia Brand was. What did she say? &quot;Maybe we&#x27;ve spent too long trying to figure all this out with theory. Love is the one thing that transcends time and space&quot;.<p>Postmodernism is dismissive of science. Did Romilly&#x27;s data that he collected during the years of scientific pursuit help anyone from the crew or humanity at large? No. Scientific method of trial and error was useless, but &quot;magical tesseract pixies&quot; powered by love saved the humanity and the protagonist.<p>Millions and millions of movie viewers &quot;understood&quot; that science and reason is not as important as love and magic. My hypothesis is when people were watching this movie they had a bit of postmodern values imprinted in their minds. That was their epiphany.<p>Christopher Nolan made an dystopian world he pictured a little closer. That is if you agree that modernism or super-modernism philosophy is more conductive to development of humanity than a postmodernism one...<p>But you know what really gets to me?<p>Nolan knew all of that. His Memento movie is an example of postmodernist film in the Wikipedia! He was perfectly aware what he was doing.<p>This citation must be included in the discussion.<p>--\nOn a deeper level, Jessica Chastain may have said it best when telling Entertainment Weekly that  “Interstellar” is a love letter from Nolan to his daughter, Flora. The film’s production title was “Flora’s Letter.” Underneath it all, that&#x27;s what &quot;Interstellar&quot; really is — a father-daughter story reflected in the relationship between Cooper and his daughter, Murph (MacKenzie Foy), the two lead characters at the center of the film.  \n--<p>A love letter. Now the movie makes perfect sense as an educational content for a child. Question the authority. Promote love. Instill hope and faith.<p>But at what price for humanity at large? For me, a price that was too high. That&#x27;s why I consider Interstellar to be harmful, irrational postmodernist trojan horse that supposedly promotes science but actually does the opposite.<p>Thank you, Christopher Nolan for making humanity a little bit less rational, thank you so much.",1417452805

If you have a lot of low-engaged/no-engaged emails, you need to try to re-engage them and/or drop them from your list. If you send 1 email a week to an address for 5 years that never opens, you are literally throwing money away. MailChimp (which we use too) has a lot of very good tools to help prune your list and glean a lot of insights into your engagement rates.<p>> Paying someone to micromanage the services to get cost savings would cost at least $60,000<p>Not necessarily. Download a copy of Openfire XMPP server, stick it on one of your spare windows/*nix boxes in the corner, and it will run un-maintained for years. Just cron/schedule the OS updates automatically and it takes no more effort/skill than logging into a website to manage user accounts.<p>And nobody says they need an expensive seasoned SysAdmin to manage these services. Hire a college student for $15-$18 per hour part time to come in and tidy things up.<p>There are other opportunities to be had with their list of services, such as taking advantage of the drastically lower cost BitBucket (if they must have their source code repo&#x27;s external).<p>There&#x27;s certainly a lot of waste listed here.",1417452492

This is what keeps your devices on your network safe. If you were to start from scratch to set up a router with an IPv6 firewall, you&#x27;d need just two rules: (1) allow packets in for already established connections and (2) drop every other incoming packet. If you know what you are doing, you can actually set this up yourself. I have, and while educational, it provided no real world benefit.<p>Most people don&#x27;t want to bother with using iptables directly, so don&#x27;t. Get a router that supports OpenWRT and flash it. For most of them, it&#x27;s a really simple process (my TP-Link let me upload the binary to flash via the web GUI). Why OpenWRT? Well, it&#x27;s secure and constantly updated, it supports IPv6 natively, and it comes with the IPv6 firewall that is configured in a fashion very similar to how you think of IPv4 (it even rate limits ping requests, etc.). As a bonus, if your ISP doesn&#x27;t support IPv6, OpenWRT has an installable web GUI component for configuring an IPv6 tunnel. Lastly, even if you don&#x27;t want IPv6 (yes, I see you there in the back, climbing back under your rock), still use OpenWRT. It seems to have a lot less bugs than commercial router firmware, and is a lot more stable and up to date than DD-WRT or Tomato.<p>Edit: One other misconception that comes up frequently is that IPv6 means that your privacy is at a more of a risk because your MAC address may be exposed. While in some configurations this can happen, IPv6 has what&#x27;s called Privacy Extensions: in addition to your more permanent MAC-based IPv6 address (network prefix + munged MAC address), your OS will periodically generate a new random IPv6 address (network prefix + random number). This actually makes it marginally harder to track you since your exact IP address will change frequently, as seen by hosts you access.

A $30 5W Raspberry Pi is more than capable of running &#x27;mail&#x27; on the command line.  For a bit more power, quad-core 1.6ghz ARM SOCs are about $60-70.  For fileserver type stuff, a 15W Liva with a Baytrail-M can be had for $115, or you can build out a full quad-core mini-ITX for something like $175.<p>The reduced power usage very quickly amortizes the cost of the hardware.  If you would save 200W by retiring a dinosaur - that&#x27;s $17.28 per month of 24/7 usage.  If you&#x27;ve got a Rpi on for 4 hours per day checking your email - it amortizes out within 10 months.<p>This totally ignores the additional headaches associated with old, failing, unsupported hardware.

Without massive and expensive maintenance, many of these bridges would be unusable, having crumbled to the point of destruction.  Pretty much period.<p>TeX is not 50, I had not meant to imply it was.  Just that it is a relatively old piece of software that has had virtually no maintenance compared to many other pieces of software.<p>Could it have used an overhaul?  It is certainly debatable.  However, Knuth has had massive success in keeping it working without worrying about use cases that just were not the aim of software.<p>To continue the comparison with bridges, it is not uncommon for them to have restrictions saying that large trucks can not cross them.  This is not a recommendation, it is a requirement.  In the software world, many would have modified TeX to do such things as typeset documents miles wide.  Because, generality!  Or some such.<p>And the concerns you have about people not knowing what an &quot;underfilled hbox&quot; means is simply a lack of training.  I would be surprised if anyone I work with below the age of 25 has even heard of TeX, much less read the documentation for it.

But in the general scheme of things, we are tiny ants crawling over the dry parts of an ant-hill floating on a small blue puddle somewhere in the backwater bayou of the universe. Our lives amount to the goings-on of ants, and we can be squashed at any moment by unseen cosmic feet.<p>The truth of this - that life, and mortality, and our existence, is a fleeting and inconsequential part of everything in the universe - really puts into perspective getting pissed off at immigration reform, or the barista that didn&#x27;t make your coffee right, or not making enough money, or not getting to see that one movie before it left theaters. We&#x27;re so unimaginably lucky to be wandering around this ant-hill, and meeting other ants, and getting to start a tiny little ant family. When it ends, it ends.<p>You should also probably get regular checkups with your doctor, and exercise regularly, don&#x27;t smoke or drink to excess, and try to get 8 hours of sleep each night.

They are systematically encysted into vesicles and surrounded by giant masses of inert cytoplasm and various organelles that depend on them completely.<p>The people that drive these economic mitochondria are often completely unaware that the entire burden of Earth&#x27;s civilization rests upon their shoulders.  They only see the needs of their own cell, and the other mitochondria in it, if any.<p>The entire remainder of the economy exists to distribute the output of the productive workers out to the nonproductive people.  Much of that transport network consists of creating an artificial need with advertising and then fulfilling it with retail goods and services.<p>Reducing weekly hours would simply slow the distribution network, and possibly decrease the overall output of the mitochondria.<p>The problem is that the entire system is completely built upon the concept that people need to look like they are important to the function of the cell in order to acquire the resources and energy produced by the mitochondria.  So everyone has to pretend that they are useful and important, as hard as they possibly can.  And the worst possible thing in the world would be to let the mitochondria catch on that they could be independent organisms, and that they don&#x27;t actually need the cells to survive.<p>Unlike biological cell mitochondria, economic mitochondria have actually been becoming stronger, faster, and more efficient during our recorded history.  This bothers the mitochondria not at all.  But it stresses the hell out of the cell&#x27;s resource distribution systems, as the median useless organelle becomes further away from its vital resources.<p>Reducing working hours is not a viable solution, because it does nothing to address the fundamental problem with our resource distribution system.  It is still completely built upon pretending to be important, with the best actors and those closest to the real economic producers getting the most resources.<p>Would it be so hard to admit that the majority of humanity is just useless cytoplasm, and put some of the massive and increasing output of the mitochondria into a vascular system  to distribute resources evenly throughout the cell, rather than relying upon diffusion and fakery?  And it turns out that yes, it actually is rather difficult.  Pretending to be important has been so critical to survival for so long that admitting one&#x27;s uselessness is tantamount to suicide.",1417451271

And might save you a lot of hassle in the middle of the night and you need vendor support, which generally at such hours could generate even more cost.<p>In my humble opinion, technical pov, the more you do in-house, and the less you rely on third parties, the more freedom the company has.<p>Also any in-house developed product, could be sold, generating income. Also, i believe, that developing your own, gives you a certain knowledge which you don&#x27;t get if you are simply adopting third party software.<p>It&#x27;s of course way easier/more clear to calculate ROI when you spending specific amounts instead of investing in knowledge, control and self power.

To my knowledge, TWC will allocate a /64, but there&#x27;s no <i>guarantee</i> that power cycling your modem will generate a new /64[0]. I believe other ISPs work the same way - they may give you a new /64, but they&#x27;re not required to and don&#x27;t guarantee it in the SLA. And most people won&#x27;t power cycle their modems often anyway, which means they could have the same /64 for months on end.<p>If we&#x27;re talking about online tracking, it&#x27;s very easy for trackers to just throw their hands up and treat all addresses within a /64 as if they represent a single user + device. This isn&#x27;t completely accurate, but it&#x27;s no less accurate than IP address tracking with IPv4.<p>Furthermore, I am unaware of any reliable commercial VPN providers that currently provide IPv6 connections (at least over OpenVPN[1]), so if you have dual-stack connectivity, your IPv6 connection can compromise your privacy even for your IPv4 connection[2].<p>[0] Technically this is true for ipv4 as well, but due to the relative scarcity of addresses you&#x27;re less likely to get a pseudo-static ipv4 address.<p>[1] OpenVPN now supports IPv6 clients, though I don&#x27;t know of any actual deployments of this.

Sunnyvale. \nJob Title: Application Security Consultant<p>-- .- - .- ... .- -. ---    ... . -.-. ..- .-. .. - -.--<p>Once a professor shared a piece of career advice with me.  &quot;Don&#x27;t call yourself a coder,&quot; he said, &quot;anyone can learn to code, but programming takes real skill.&quot;  His words have stuck with me since.  Coding was, in his description, the mere act of producing something a computer can interpret and act upon.  Programming, however, seeks elegance and simplicity through considered design and thought that transcends the code itself.  While both take skill, the goals are different and they can be thought of as distinct disciplines.<p>Application Security, I&#x27;ve come to believe, is yet another discipline with a slightly different focus.  &#x27;Coders&#x27; focus almost exclusively on iterating until they achieve a desired result. &#x27;Programmers&#x27; might test and refine to improve performance and reduce resource consumption. But with an Application Security perspective, we instead look at unintended functionality and edge cases that give rise to problems; &#x27;What if&#x27; scenarios involving abuse cases that weren&#x27;t part of the original design.  It&#x27;s yet another way of looking at the same application, with a different goal and different outcome.<p>At Matasano, we don&#x27;t build software, we break it.  We find, exploit, document, and prioritize flaws so the application&#x27;s developers can address them.  We identify when security controls are effective, and note areas for improvement.  We review use cases, identify abuse cases, and help guide future development efforts. We work across a wide variety of applications ranging from simple web apps, to complex hardware appliances. From HTTP to proprietary encrypted protocols, and everything in between.

We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We just got back from Portugal...where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=""http://we.are.expensify.com/apply"" rel=""nofollow"">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).<p>We are excited to hear from you!",1417450399

Our first application area is pathogen detection – working with doctors, epidemiologists, and public health officials to identify and characterize the bacteria and viruses that threaten our health. And already, we’ve attracted users at many of the top public health and research organizations across the globe.<p>===============<p>==== About You ====<p>===============<p>We’re looking for talented software engineers to help us build towards our vision for a global genomics data network and enable widespread <i>in</i> <i>silico</i> diagnostics. Specifically, we’re interested in folks with a passion for and depth of experience in one or more of the following areas:<p>1) Full Stack Engineering: We will be building everything from developer-facing APIs to easy-to-use end applications for doctors and public health officials. You care about everything from elegant APIs to compelling data visualizations. Python experience preferred (we currently use Flask for our web backend).<p>2) Distributed Systems: We’re building systems for organizing and indexing billions to trillions of genomic fingerprints across the entire tree of life. You’re passionate about data structures, efficient computational solutions, and distributed systems (and don’t mind the occasional bit twiddling). We’ve built some cool initial tech in C, Nimrod, and Python (probabilistic data structures, Docker pipelines for reliably running bioinformatics workflows, etc.), and are excited about the extensive greenfield opportunities here.<p>3) Genomics / Computational Biology: We are tackling hard problems at the intersection of microbiology, genomics, statistics, and computer science. You have research experience or another strong connection to these fields, understand current bioinformatics tools and approaches (and their limits), and have worked extensively with next-generation sequencing data. Ideally, you also have some intuitions and strong hypotheses about how bioinformatics tools can scale for petabyte-sized reference sets.<p>===<p>You’ll be one of our first hires and directly shape our technology choices, product, and business.

The Federal reserve system raised interest rates in the past to deal successfully with inflation, and lowered them in the last few years to deal with deflation, and discourage hoarding of money, which happens when companies sit on their cash &quot;until they see demand&quot; which never materializes, lay off their workers who then spend less etc. When every individual acts in their own interest they collectively exacerbate deflationary spirals, runs on banks etc. -- in an economy with a centralized money supply this needs to be mitigated. In a society with decentralized money issuers, this is less of a concern - eg if Detroit goes bankrupt, others can swoop in and pick up the slack.<p>In short - no, there is no hyperinflation about to happena and in fact the US is able to borrow money and sell treasuries at record low interest rates compared to other countries.

But the status quo in terms of UX is hideous (barely above twm-grade), and it is currently next to impossible to use Plan 9 on a modern laptop with a touchpad.<p>In short, my view is that chording your way through rio using a three-button mouse is about as unfriendly as modern Gnome, and that someone ought to put a stop to that without such tomfoolery as porting another DE to Plan9.<p>Technological modernization won&#x27;t win Plan9 new supporters, whereas UX modernization will, at worst, make it easier to use.<p>Edited to add: I have Acme running via plan9ports on the Mac, and even the simple addition of Cmd+C/V/etc. for copy/paste made a world of difference. I am positively thrilled with the notion of actually using it someday without constant fiddling with the Option key and my touchpad.",1417449616

We&#x27;re a non-profit tech company that helps artists make their art while we handle the nitty-gritty.<p>We&#x27;re badly in need of a UI/UX-type. We have several different tech products and each one has it&#x27;s own look and feel. As we move along, we&#x27;d like the L&F of those products to converge rather than diverge.<p>We need someone to come in and be the authority on this sort of thing. Create a new Bootstrap theme to unify this stuff. Help us understand why this is good and this is bad.<p>You&#x27;ll have a fair amount of authority and autonomy. Big features start out with prototyping/wireframing and this is where you&#x27;ll be a big asset. Work with the biz to refine a feature before it hits the devs and becomes a thrashing boondoggle.<p>This position REQUIRES that you be at least familiar with Ruby and Ruby on Rails. We&#x27;re good at teaching people this stuff (we run a fellowship program that teaches artists to code) but whoever comes in to this position will at least need some foundation to stand on. We&#x27;ll do our best to train up the rest.<p>We offer all sorts of perks like a fun office, fun people to work with, and a management team that is truly willing to listen to feedback and react. A bunch of other stuff too.<p>NYC-based would be fantastic but a lot of us are remote so that might work too.<p>Email me to get in touch: gary.moore@fracturedatlas.org",1417449609

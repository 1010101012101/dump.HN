9411718,comment,9409684,9411097,0,0,cpprototypes,,,"LA is working on greatly expanding rail.  Denser development will slowly occur near the new stations to make walking to the station an option for some.  However, LA will never have the density of NYC and so walking to a station will never become an option for most in LA.<p>But Uber/Lyft (especially Uberpool and Lyft Line) are potential solutions to this.  I don&#x27;t think they have the critical mass yet to be a true solution.  But if they ever reach that point, it may become viable someday to commute to/from work by using only a mix of Uber/Lyft and rail.  It&#x27;s already possible today, but only for high income jobs.  For this to have a big effect on LA transportation, it must become an option for middle class jobs.<p>It&#x27;s possible that the critical mass of Uber/Lyft can only be achieved with self driving cars.  Some think that self driving cars will mean the end of public transportation.  But I think they will instead complement each other well.  The roads are already at capacity.  Self driving cars will help improve the efficiency, but traffic is like a gas, it simply fills to the new available space.  It&#x27;s why adding a new lane to a freeway usually doesn&#x27;t help much.  The main reason is that a single occupant in a vehicle that can seat 4 or more is fundamentally a very inefficient way to travel.  Making the car self driving doesn&#x27;t change this fact.<p>There is potential in the future for rail and cars in LA to work together to truly improve transportation.  Uber/Lyft and self driving cars could solve the &quot;last mile&quot; issue of getting to/from stations.  Rail can provide the high efficiency and density that freeways can never provide.  I hope this is the future of LA transportation because I don&#x27;t think cars alone or rail alone will be enough to truly solve the traffic issue.",1429577149

9411715,comment,9409815,9411602,0,0,CHY872,,,"You&#x27;ve absolutely misrepresented the problem, presumably for effect. It&#x27;s a far more subtle problem; the question is whether compiler writers should not only make their analyses and transformations be safe in the presence of valid code, but also safe in the presence of invalid code.<p>This is ironically mainly a problem because older compilers acted normally on some undefined code. So more modern optimising compilers will expect defined behaviour and so forth, leading to new bugs reported in old code. These bugs were always present, they just appear only now.<p>It&#x27;s not the compiler trying to exploit the undefined behaviour deliberately; it&#x27;s that the compiler is expecting the behaviour to be defined and behaving accordingly. So if you have<p><pre><code>    int x = *foo;\n    if (foo == NULL) {\n        ERROR();\n    }\n</code></pre>\nthen clearly in valid C, the if statement will never be taken, so it&#x27;s safe to remove it. This is something you&#x27;d want to happen in most cases, it just so happens that in the above case you might not want it to.<p>In terms of whether the fraction of a percent is worth it, well the people who do most of the development of the compilers is large companies like Google, and they don&#x27;t do it out of the goodness of their hearts, they do it because the benefit of having high performance compilers is worth the expenditure.<p>In terms of whether other languages are better, of course they are for many tasks, but C is king of the embedded world, where implementing a full Rust/Java/Node/language of day compiler is too much work. Then for many high performance tasks it&#x27;s very difficult to beat the sheer performance of C or C++. If a task written in C or C++ runs just 20% faster than Java for Google/Microsoft/etc&#x27;s 40,000 computer cluster, then that&#x27;s 7000 computers that you don&#x27;t need to buy.<p>For the bit about GPUs, well that&#x27;s kinda an aside but GPUs are useful for some things and not others and appealing to their use suggests ignorance. People use C for lots of things, and &#x27;high performance bit-twiddling&#x27; isn&#x27;t a standard one. GPUs are terrible at most tasks.<p>The proposal for a friendly dialect of C is useful, but I suspect that the smarter way of doing it is the [0] undefined behaviour sanitiser, which produces an instrumented binary that errors when it reaches undefined behaviour.<p>The developer, upon finding a new bug in their code, compiles, runs, gets an error, fixes, rinses, repeats.<p>[0] - <a href=""https://developerblog.redhat.com/2014/10/16/gcc-undefined-behavior-sanitizer-ubsan/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developerblog.redhat.com/2014/10/16/gcc-undefined-be...</a>",1429577029

For example, it&#x27;s legal to send a pointer through a channel as a way of transferring ownership and never access the object again. If the debugger rewrites the code so that &quot;never accesses it again&quot; is no longer true, it&#x27;s created a data race.<p>On the other hand, godebug generates straightforward single-threaded code that creates pointers to locals in a shadow data structure and accesses them later. There&#x27;s no reason it shouldn&#x27;t work if you&#x27;re not using goroutines.<p>In particular, a previous call to godebug.Declare(&quot;x&quot;, &x) will add a pointer to what was previously a local variable to a data structure. This effectively moves all locals to a heap representation of the goroutine&#x27;s stack, to be accessed later. It&#x27;s going to kill performance, but it&#x27;s legal to do.",1429577002

9411678,comment,9411225,9411225,0,0,yellowapple,,,"I personally use the MIT License (as defined by the OSI; in FSF terms, it would be the &quot;Expat&quot; license) as my default license for most things.  My personal rule of thumb is that a software license should readably fit on a single screen whenever possible (I got sick of folks like Apple and Microsoft and their million-page EULAs), and most &quot;copyfree&quot; licenses, like the MIT/Expat (and MIT/X11), BSD, ISC, etc. licenses fit the bill rather perfectly.<p>I&#x27;ve tended to avoid copyleft licenses due to the potential complications caused by license incompatibility when trying to combine code with other code; since I&#x27;d prefer my code to be as useful to as many open-source projects as possible, I consequently prefer something as relaxed as possible.<p>My one exception (other than when required to make an exception by an employer or client, of course), however, is when I&#x27;m writing Perl code (particularly Perl code that&#x27;s meant to be reused, such as something on CPAN); in these cases, it&#x27;s standard convention to use either &quot;the same license as Perl itself&quot; (Artistic License / GNU GPL dual-license) or the Artistic License 2.0 (or later), so I just stick to convention.<p>-----<p>Those are my needs, however.  Everyone has different needs for a license.<p>If your priority is ensuring that your code doesn&#x27;t make its way into proprietary projects, the most surefire way to do this is with a &quot;copyleft&quot; license.  The GNU General Public License (version 2 or later) is probably the most common such license.  When I use the GNU GPL (aside from with Perl packages), I tend to use version 2 with an &quot;or any later version&quot; statement; version 3 includes anti-TiVOization language that - while useful if I&#x27;m an extremist - is a bit excessive for my tastes.  Other options here include the GNU &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License (basically the GPL, except that it allows non-free software to dynamically link against your software; useful for libraries, for example), the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (allows integration with differently-licensed software, so long as the MPL&#x27;d parts remain MPL&#x27;d), and the Artistic License 2.0 (derived works may be distributed either under the same license (to either everyone or just the original author, at the new author&#x27;s discretion) or under a different license but forbidden to use the original name or interfere with the installation of the original version); the MPL2.0 and AL2.0 are both compatible with the GPL (though the MPL has an optional &quot;Exhibit B&quot; that can disallow that compatibility), and are better classified as being &quot;partial&quot; copyleft licenses (in the sense that they aren&#x27;t as strict as even the LGPL).<p>If your priority is instead just to make sure you&#x27;re credited for your work, pretty much any non-public-domain-dedicating free software license will do in practice, though the BSD license is the most explicit about this in the copyfree camp (the 2-clause or 3-clause is recommended; the 4-clause is frowned upon).  The ISC and MIT (of the Expat or X11 varieties) are also suitable here, though they&#x27;re not as explicit about attribution in binary distributions of derived works.<p>If you&#x27;re concerned about patents, the Apache License 2.0 and GNU General Public License version 3 provide some protections regarding patents that might be useful.  The Apache License has some other nice features as well (trademark protection, proper attribution, non-copyleft, default contribution agreement, etc.).<p>It&#x27;s difficult to provide a more specific suggestion without clarification regarding what, exactly, about your code you intend to &quot;protect&quot;.",1429576377

I don&#x27;t think most people realize how much food is produced in California.  If California agriculture goes down, the result will be high food price increases everywhere.  Many just have a cavalier attitude of &quot;the market will adjust&quot;.  There are big issues with just assuming &quot;the market will adjust&quot;<p>1) There is a big lag time for some crops to grow.  Something like corn is no problem.  But apples or anything else grown from a tree? Or any other crop that requires years of growing before it&#x27;s productive?  It will be many years until the California output could be matched.<p>2) Other places like the Midwest have potential water issues too.  For example, look at the history of the Ogallala Aquifer.  If a greater strain is put on the aquifer, it&#x27;s possible they will also have the same water shortages that California has now.<p>The California water crisis is a national issue, but the rest of the nation would rather just laugh at us.  The western states should be discussing serious proposals to build more aqueducts or pipelines to divert water from water-rich states to California.  Maybe the Federal government could help with financing desalination plants.  But this kind of cooperation isn&#x27;t happening.

One way to reduce heat in cities is to increase tree canopy cover.<p>Here is recent lesson from the city of Melbourne, Australia, regarding drought and tree cover:<p>* the city experienced a drought from 1999 - 2007 [1]\n* as a short-term measure to conserve water, a decision was made to stop watering the city&#x27;s trees [2]\n* consequently, ~40% of the city&#x27;s trees are dead, or are in decline. The council now expects that 27% of the trees will die in the next 10 years, and 44% of the trees will die in the next 20 years.<p>Melbourne city now is aiming to improve tree canopy cover from 22% to 40% by 2040 [3], as a means to reduce the city&#x27;s temperature by 4 degrees C. There is also work to capture storm water run-off from the city to use for irrigation.<p>Note that this is only talking about Melbourne&#x27;s city centre (0.12m residential population of 4.2m total) [4].<p>As an aside, outside of cities, there is a recent Nature Geoscience paper that links lethal tree water stress thresholds to long-term climate models, and forecasts tree deaths due to drought in the southwestern United States by ~2050, assuming the world follows a high-emissions business-as-usual scenario (RCP 8.5, i.e. uncontrolled emissions, which tracks reality to date) [5].<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Sustainability/AdaptingClimateChange/Pages/Drought.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Sustainability/AdaptingClim...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://citiscope.org/story/2015/can-melbourne-lower-its-temperature-4-degrees"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citiscope.org/story/2015/can-melbourne-lower-its-temp...</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Sustainability/UrbanForest/Pages/About.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Sustainability/UrbanForest/...</a>\n[4] <a href=""https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/AboutMelbourne/Statistics/Pages/MelbourneSnapshot.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/AboutMelbourne/Statistics/P...</a>\n[5] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2400.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo24...</a>",1429575965

If we coldly consider results I think it hardly qualifies as more than a relatively extended fad. It&#x27;s not even nearly as popular as Delphi was in its heyday, let alone top-ten languages like Java, C, C++, C#, PHP, VB and JavaScript.

9411600,comment,9411225,9411225,0,0,informatimago,,,"Basically, the question you have to answer is whether you want to allow others (notably commercial corporations), to use your code to integrate into their own products without contributing back either to your code, or in general.<p>If you want that, then you can use licenses like MIT or BSD. (Notice how MIT and BSD are universities, where the people who worked on those software, initially, had alreay been paid, by the american tax payer, thru university salaries or DARPA grants; in this setting, it makes perfectly sense that the american tax payer be able to use the code he already paid for, and possibly to integrate it into proprietary commercial products).<p>On the other hand, if you want to ensure that people who use you code to make and distribute derived works provide their own contribution and share their own software too, then you will want to use a GPL license. (An intermediate license is the LGPL, better reserved for libraries that should compete with other libraries already under MIT or BSD).  Notably, nowadays a lot of people build services accessible thru the network without distributing any software, but having it just run on their own servers.  For this situation, the AGPL3 licence is indicated: if they use your code to make such a remote service, they will still have to distribute their modifications and sources, which will then allow users to verify that your code and their code is not used for nefarious purposes (like, forwarding private data to the NSA), notably allowing those users to run the server code on their own servers.  (Cf. eg. opencloud vs. dropbox).<p>So my advice is to use the AGPL3 license by default, and only upon very special circumstances, release your code under another license.<p>For example, if such a commercial corporation wants pay you for a MIT license so they can use your code, as the right owner, you still can provide them with such; if they don&#x27;t then they can always hire you, unless most probably they just expected free work from you?<p>You will hear complains about the GPL and the AGPL, but only from selfish people or corporations.",1429574926

The hyperlink regexp seems to pick up trailing punctuation, like periods, commas, and parentheses.  Any chance we can exclude them from the link target?  I think several of my links have broken because of that.",1177113507

15247,comment,15133,15173,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"I don't think Myspace has any merit. I think it's doing well for the same reason that hit songs are doing well: random network butterfly effects. That experiment about showing people which songs were popular vs. not showing them-- due to totally random noise, one song (or startup) will be a little ahead, and then whoosh, it has all the listeners (or users). There's nothing about Myspace itself that makes it more likely among a field of similar, better-designed contenders to do well; it's just the random fluctuations of the market that made it king.

I was actually trying to write an essay about the importance of the marginal.<p>Can you be a little more literal and tell me what part of the post seems to say something about distinguishing the difference between computers and reality?<p>Also, I thought I was hand waving the ""99"" thing and saying it isn't important how accurate the number is. Should I be more emphatic?",1177110512

15234,comment,14253,15107,0,0,rms,,,"Fine. Mathematics is generally based on so-called ""non-logical axioms"" -- non proven statements that we accept based on what a person such as yourself would call faith. <p>Still, I believe in mathematics because it works. Why do you believe in the god of the Christians to the exclusion of all others?",1177110365
15233,comment,15218,15218,0,0,gyro_robo,,,"This is a case of overgeneralizing.  Evolution favors the organism most responsive to change; thus, one must recognize conditions how they are, instead of operating from a mental model of how they were, to increase one's chances.<p>It's <i>always</i> relative; a combination of idea and environment.  The mistake is, when something doesn't work out, that we are tempted to say that the idea must be a bad idea.  The correct inference is that the combination of the idea and that particular environment did not work.<p>The corresponding mistake is to assign blame to the environment and say the environment is just bad for everything.  Note that hardly anyone makes <i>that</i> mistake -- instead, they say, ""the environment isn't <i>ready</i> for this idea <i>yet</i>"", noting that change is inevitable.<p>Another way of stating this is that the author failed to investigate <i>why</i> something was problematic.  Instead, it's as if he was operating blindly; ""I got burned by X, so in the future I will avoid X, because X burns.""  That's somewhat like a child bumping into a kitchen table and getting mad at the table.  ""Tables are a problem -- let's get rid of them.""

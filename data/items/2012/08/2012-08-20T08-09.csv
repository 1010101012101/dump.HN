Live closer to work. Take your lunch break & have a stroll. Don't eat too many pizzas or chips. See some friends at least twice a week. Cook a nice meal for a mate. See an amazing film. Don't watch live tv. Find projects to work on with people you like, and that they're also motivated by. Ask someone you like out on a date, at least once a month. Be ambitious, but don't beat yourself up for not achieving. Learn from mistakes - actually recognise improvements, but don't beat yourself up for not doing them..they'll be another time.

4406741,comment,4406224,4406588,3,0,tikhonj,,,"Just because you <i>can</i> do something with a language does not mean you should. Sure, lots of people make stuff with poorer languages. Lots of people also never write tests, skimp on documentation and copy and paste half their code. It works for them! The best choice would be to think about the problems people have with Java and find a good solution for them (e.g. Scala).<p>People use all sorts of distinctly sub-optimal tools and technologies for various reasons unrelated to those technologies' merits. One of the biggest reasons is familiarity--many people do not like learning radically new things and so stick to what they know. Popularity does not imbue any sort of quality to programming languages any more than it does to anything else like music. There's a reason that trained musicians respect classical music--even if they're making pop--and there's a reason programming language people respect ML.<p>In short: just because many people manage to use Java does not mean it is in any sense optimal or even good.<p>Also, I think the oft-repeated ""right tool for the right job"" bromide about programming languages is deeply flawed. Programming languages overlap <i>far</i> more than most tools--they are all <i>general-purpose</i> programming languages, after all. The difference between a hammer and a screwdriver is far greater than even the difference between Java and Haskell. Choosing a programming language is more like choosing the best power drill--they overlap almost completely and can do the same jobs. It's quite plausible that some are almost always better than others, but that you could ultimately do the job with either. It will just be more difficult with one than the other.<p>Also, even if languages did differ significantly, there is no guarantee that any particular language has anything it's best at--it can be strictly worse than other languages for every conceivable use.<p>Finally, I think that surrendering to familiarity and choosing something you know over something you need to learn is rarely a good choice. Sure, if you have a hard deadline, it might be a reasonable compromise. But learning a language is essentially a constant expense where its affect on your productivity is linear to how much you program. Just because it might take more effort to get started with Scala does not mean you should immediately consign yourself to the drag on productivity that is Java.<p>You should be learning something new all the time, and programming languages are some of the most important things to learn in CS--they affect not only what you write but how you think. So strive to find the best one you can rather than settling for something that works--in this day and age, expecting your language to be somewhat usable is too low a bar to set.",1345451921

It's extremely verbose, the type system is mediocre at best, it's actively hostile to functional programming (and lets not even consider anything else like logic programming!), the syntax is extremely inflexible.<p>Your tirade against ""fanboys"" is nothing but a straw man--the point of having more expressive, concise code is not ""saving a few characters of typing"" but making your program easier to write and easier to read (and, therefore, easier to maintain). Sure, you can get stuff done with Java, but you can generally get it done faster and better with other languages.<p>High-level features absolutely matter in the real world--they allow you to write code faster and give you more confidence that it is correct. Code written at a higher level is not only shorter but also more declarative and clearer. The idea that only ""language designers and fanboys"" care about having these features in their languages is patently absurd and rather arrogant.<p>To me, it seems Java is a compromise--it ignores decades of research and progress in programming language design in favor of catering to people who knew C++ and didn't want to learn something radically different. Thanks to being widely taught, it is now essentially a lowest common denominator: practically any programmer you meet will have at least learned the basics of Java at some point. But I think this is exactly the sort of compromise any good programmers should <i>not</i> take!<p>Now, the JVM is, admittedly, a good platform. It has some glaring weaknesses--poor support for functional programming, poor interoperation with native code, long start-up time and so on--but, on the whole, is very strong. Happily, you aren't bound to Java if you want to be on the JVM and you can use some of the great alternatives like Scala.

Isn't VirtualBox sufficient? It is open source and runs on Linux, OS X and MS Windows. Perhaps I am missing some core idea.<p>Then there is veewee[1] which started life as a Vagrant plugin but as of version 0.3.0 it can be used standalone and one can ssh to the boxes using it, just like with Vagrant. If they were to add provisioning it would probably be an alternative to Vagrant feature for feature so maybe we're seeing a bit of competition between these two tools there.<p>On Ubuntu there is VMBuilder[2] written in Python but it doesn't offer provisioning as far as I know.<p>Last, as others have mentioned there is libvirt[3] which offers tools for communicating with different VMs but I don't think it offers a tool that matches what Vagrant does 1:1 (most notably the provisioning part).<p>1. <a href=""https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee/blob/master/doc/README-changes.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee/blob/master/doc/README-c...</a><p>2. <a href=""https://launchpad.net/vmbuilder"" rel=""nofollow"">https://launchpad.net/vmbuilder</a><p>3. <a href=""http://libvirt.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://libvirt.org</a>",1345450674

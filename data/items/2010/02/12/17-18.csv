We are so skewed of using our own apps that we think all is perfect. Nothing ever is. I think its a great idea how to get more usage data. If I try it I will let you know how it went.

In both cases, they clicked ""No thanks, take me to my inbox"" instead of the button to ""Check out Buzz"", and in both cases, Buzz was enabled anyways, and a bunch of people were listed as following/followers.  We looked at their profiles, and all the followers/ees were publicly listed.<p>What, exactly, should they have done to keep this from happening?",1265994394

There are still 6,500 photos left in the upload queue from earlier today.  We're processing them LIFO so it may take us a few more minutes for us to get to the photos uploaded early this morning.<p>Since the queue is so large expect new photo uploads to take longer than they normally should.<p>If you have any more problems please email us directly:  human -åt- divvyshot -dºt- com",1265994101

And having a ""name brand"" on your CV helps more than having been to a top college. 3 years at McK or GS and you will never have trouble getting anyone to take you seriously in business.

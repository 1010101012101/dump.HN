351750,comment,351529,351746,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"I think a government-run system has incentives that are going to produce a lower quality educational product for everyone. I am for educational markets. Subsidizing the consumption of education by poor people through something like a voucher program would likely mean higher quality education for poor and rich alike compared to the government-run model, for the same price.<p>I suspect that children of wealthy parents would perform better in school than their less-wealthy peers under any reasonable system. I don't think that is the problem that should concern us the most.",1225669939

Of the skills you have that earn you money, what percent were learned in public schools ( versus from parents, on your own, through social networks, on the job, etc)?  And of the things you learned in school, how much of it was stuff that actually cost money to teach ( via direct instruction or expensive lab equipment) and how much of it was just doing the assigned readings?",1225669660

As such, the ""applications"" aren't so much a toolbox a la applied math as much as nice concrete examples that help me understand the underlying theory.<p>And for the record, another hat in the ring for Strang's Linear Algebra and its Applications.",1225668873

351733,comment,351529,351695,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"There is no way to make people perfectly equal. There are, however, ways to improve educational opportunities for everyone. Technology is one way. Educational markets are another. These methods should be embraced.<p>Raising the quality of education for everyone is important. Maybe I have a capacity for envy below that of the average human, but I would rather see everyone get a 10x better education than see the gap between the best and the worst narrowed by some amount. If we could choose between a program that increased everybody's income by $10,000 or one that reduced everybody's income by 50%, I would rather choose the first program even though the second would dramatically decrease any measure of income inequality.<p>Unfortunately, children from wealthy homes don't get better educations only because their schools have more money to spend. If this were the case, the United States would have the best primary schools in the world and perennial hell-holes like DC Public Schools would be educational utopias. Rather, parents in wealthy homes play an active role in their children's education and place importance on the role of education in their children's lives, as their parents likely did.<p>The government could redistribute income, but it can't redistribute culture. Unless we resort to monstrous social engineering schemes like allocating children to homes by lottery istead of by birth, we are not going to eliminate the inequality caused by home culture. And we haven't begun to talk about the inequalities caused by genetics.<p>But working on a solution to inequality is focusing on the wrong problem. It is a symptom of zero-sum thinking that doesn't reflect the issues of the real world. The real problem is how to improve the educational opportunity for each person, not equalize opportunities between people. After all, you can equalize the education everyone receives by banning education.<p>Luck will always play a role in life. We can still try to make every life better.",1225668746

(at least, in terms of the talent you'll meet)<p>In terms of available jobs, it is a bit frustrating.  I know the Dealer Flow guys are currently looking for new talent - they're doing some cool stuff w/ Erlang (ejabberd, primarily I believe) and Ruby/Rails.  There's a place in town called Sagebit (sagebit.com), which is smaller and does a mix of their own products + consultancy work.  I don't know if they're looking, but they're good people to meet regardless. (Ruby/Rails/Merb, btw.)  I know there's also some startup stuff going on down in Bloomington, which is (of course, entirely by my own opinion) a bit more likely of a town to make good computer sci. contacts in the greater world, what with your proximity to IUB.  I only say that to guess, however.<p>Additionally, there's a Python meetup group in town, a bit smaller than the Ruby group.  They've been regularly meeting at Broadripple Brewpub, and are primarily pushed by Six Feet Up, a company that's pretty active in the Zope/Plone/Python world.  SFU is mostly consultant based, not really a startup, but they're good people to meet if you're more into that sorta thing.<p>AFA an HN meetup in Indy, I'd give a +1 to that.",1225667090

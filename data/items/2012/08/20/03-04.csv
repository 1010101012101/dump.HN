I had some monster Brembo GT's that allowed my little WRX to haul down from the triple digits and dive into the turns (paired with Tein coilovers). If you go up there you'll see how you have to cut in really fast towards the apex and then do a fairly ragged kick out the end to gain speed into the next straight.<p>Infineon is just a nightmare of walls imho :)",1345435154

4406205,comment,4401606,4402076,2,0,bhorowitz,,,"Sadly, this whole discussion missed the point of the post, which is probably a pretty good argument for writing it in a different way. Having said that, many people got the point and didn't get balled up in this detail. The point of the post was that either being a good company is a priority or it is not. If it's not a priority, there's very little chance that it will happen. Further, if people don't understand both why it's a priority and how high the priority is, it won't happen. The controversial line about firing Steve and Tim was intended to be a colorful way to bring sharp clarity to what had evidently been a fuzzy priority. I tend to value clarity over sensitivity, but that's obviously not universal.<p>In terms of whether or not it was right to ""clarify"" things to Steve that way, I really did not provide enough context in the post to answer that question. However, implicit in the communication was me prioritizing the employees of the company over the managers and executives. Specifically, if you don't hold managers strongly accountable for management, then the employees will suffer which in my opinion is worse than executives getting their feelings hurt.<p>For whatever it's worth, I never wrote and I never asked anybody to work 12 or 16 hours a day. I never asked anybody to work any specific number of hours. However, many people did and it was important to me that we respect the effort.<p>The firing line was intended to come across as the very last straw. After training, after many conversations, after performance reviews, if I still couldn't get them to take management seriously then this was to be the last conversation before making a change. If I didn't hold managers accountable to that, then I should be fired as well-- no question about that.",1345434991

Seeing the lap times they knocked down is quite impressive too.<p>Thunder Hill is probably one of the more technically challenging tracks around. There are several off-camber turns, a nasty rise where you basically have to pitch yourself over it without being able to see (pucker factor 9,000) and two straightaways with flat and very oddly-aligned turns.<p>The fact that this TT was able to go so quickly around it is quite awesome - this gives me hope that driverless cars won't be as boring as I fear they'll be.",1345434950

If it can be instantaneous, all the better.  When the recipient chooses to read it is their business.<p>Real-time communications systems are quite valuable, in my opinion.  Financial markets now rely on them.<p>But what I'd really like to see are more real-time operating systems for general use, by consumers.  A real-time kernel makes computing very predictable.  The time taken to complete a task can be accurately estimated before it is undertaken.  Sometimes this is very useful.  Sometimes the user might only want to do one or more single things at a time.  Maybe there's a task I perform everyday and I want to be sure it will always take the same amount of time, each and every day.<p>In the real world, outside of computers, everyone knows ""multitasking"" is overrated.  If you want results, it's better to be able to _focus_.<p>Maybe we might say the same for computers, in some situations.",1345434833

I work all the time, but I've noticed a few times that when I am stuck working (say I have to stay until 9pm and know it rather than I choose to stay until 9pm) the experience becomes different for me at least.

But once again, nothing like this has happened before in NZ.<p>You honestly never see gang people around, you never see people cracked out of their mind walking around Queen St/K Rd.<p>I've only been in to LA once but I imagine Auckland would be a lot safer due to the fact that it's a much smaller compact city and there's no guns here.

More equity at home might just be what America needs to be more competitive abroad.""<p>Evidence:<p>""Like Finland, Norway is small and not especially diverse overall, but unlike Finland it has taken an approach to education that is more American than Finnish.

4406122,comment,4405127,4405127,1,0,govind201,,,"This article resonates with me on so many levels. When I started working on Semantics3 early this year, I spent many a day frustrated that I was barely achieving 50% of the productivity that I was capable of and I felt quite miserable about it. Here are a few things I did to get things back on track:<p>1) Moved Closer to Work: Daily long journeys are massive downers. When I awake in the morning, I often feel the urge to hit my laptop right away and channel all the early morning enthusiasm towards work. College years were ideal on this front because there was never anywhere to be (I wasn't too inclined towards attending classes ;)). Anyway, now, I live 20 mins away from work.<p>2) Stopped Listening to Music (especially during the few hours after I awake): I'm a music buff and perennially have music in my ears. But I find that music often blocks useful thoughts; letting the mind wander leads me down interesting channels, be it more ideas for my startup or even bugs in my code that I discover by merely thinking about the previous day's work (Rob Pike's ""Best Programming Advice"" comes to mind). Few things are more satisfying than stumbling on these nuggets! These days, I restrict music to certain times of day, such as my ride home or during certain phases during the work day.<p>3) Found Time at Work Alone: I like getting to work a couple of hours before everyone else, before any distractions kick in. For some of you, staying at work an hour after everyone leaves, lunchtime, or even spending an hour at home to finish things up might do the trick. Those power-charged hours make me feel like I've given that extra bit to my day.

For closed circuit courses like those used by Formula 1, the teams already have almost perfect topographic maps and models of the circuit, including measurements of the grip characteristics of the surface at various points on the circuit.  Formula 1 teams run endless simulations and already know what the best possible lap should be.<p>But that's just qualifying.  Racing is about so much more. Driving software will have to integrate considerably more inputs in order to avoid crashing into other cars.  Let's say cars have to share telemetry.  Development could probably happen in parallel with other improvements but I'd still stay 3-5 years.<p>Even if we assume software that can drive in a pack of cars, and algorithms for attacking and defending, there's that drive to win that makes some drivers do things that, if we're honest, aren't fair, safe or even right.  The rules are different when nobody's life is at stake.<p>I would love to see Formula 0.  No worries about driver safety.  No artificial design limits to reduce cornering speed.  In fact, the only design rule I would impose is the maximum height above ground and perhaps something about no laser cannons.<p>Does anyone remember Rogue and then Rog-O-Matic?

Python coders ""must"" write explicit code (although they have the means to write something more implicit/magical), Ruby ""must"" write .each (when they can do for, while, etc).<p>To me it seems like there are two consequences.<p>1) It's a huge burden on the beginner to be effectively aware of <i>all</i> the possibilities of doing things (like looping) in a language, and why one should be used where. In general, when a beginner picks up a language, he should be doing stuff and recognizing the trade-offs of what he's doing. Thus, he culminates critical awareness through choices and reflection of those choices.<p>I just can't imagine myself learning Python and hearing about doing things in a hundred different non-Pythonic ways.  Unless I were to do it one way, and then later discover of my own accord that there is another way I can do it which has its associated cost/benefits.<p>2) If these ""social mores"" are indoctrination, and indoctrination is taboo, what if beginners stop writing .each loops?

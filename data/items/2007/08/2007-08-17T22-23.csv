43653,comment,43036,43036,0,0,vikram,,,"I understand the idea, that creating a clone isn't the way to go. But I think their is nothing wrong with trying to solve the same problem. With the ipod, Apple realized that like with the mobile phone, how it looks is much more important than how much space it has. I bought the first generation ipod. I remember a guy stopping me on a train station and wanting to try it out. We talked about it for a bit, he loved it, didn't care how much it cost. Unfortunately for him it didn't work with Windows. When Apple fixed that everything changed. The rest of the products on the market are just not good enough with respect to the ipod in terms of looks.",1187391363

If they produced it, the editors won't change it.<p>You get karma for bringing quality content to other people's attention, not for calling the content something it isn't.",1187390168

I was just visiting it today and was amazed by the number of ignoranuses (ignoranus = someone who is both stupid and an asshole) on it.<p>I wonder if this is the eventual fate of all online communities.  I've been through at least half a dozen now, and I've yet to see one survive as something other than trite, meaningless bullshit.<p>The curious thing is - in at least one case (HP fandom, and possibly the C2 wiki), I kept the friendships that I formed in it.  Maybe that's the real point of online communities - form offline friendships, and keep those.<p>Looking forward to the Boston meetup on Sunday...",1187390086

43639,comment,43635,43635,0,0,palish,,,"Wait, what?  Dude, a story that's submitted should be titled the same regardless of who submits the story.  The only variance in titles should be mere semantics.  Any extra information in the title only adds bias or spelling/grammar mistakes.  Therefore, editing a title to its correct form is just fine.  Relax.<p>But if you can't relax, goodbye.  If this thread title is any indication, you produce great Reddit/Digg titles.<p>I hope Paul changes ""title: "" to ""suggest a title: "" on the submission page so people realize it's not <i>their</i> title.  They didn't produce the content, and if they did then the editors aren't retitle it.",1187389537
43638,comment,43416,43580,0,0,lkozma,,,"A <i>few</i> people at either extreme wouldn't make the <i>median</i> go anywhere, that's the whole idea of using median instead of arithmetic mean.                
               
 
Probably this explains the difference between genders: say three women have 1,5 and 9 partners, while three men have 0,0 and 15 partners, the means are 5 in both cases, but the medians 5 vs. 0.

43635,story,,,48,67,jmpeters,"Goodbye, Hacker News. I'm going back to Reddit.",,"It was worth putting up with the sycophancy of many of the commenters here who seem to participate only to impress PG, their would-be benefactor...for a while. It was worth it while the stories focused on the niche we are all interested in, startups. The change to more general-purpose news, the attempt to re-create the Reddit of old, seemed to be made without first asking the overall community for input (unlike the way that Craig Newmark makes all changes to Craig's List, for example). Although it has apparently been going on all along, this title-censoring thing is, for me, the final straw. Yes, Reddit has been overrun by the unwashed masses. It has become messy in the way that democracy itself is messy. But this site is getting the feeling of an artificially sterile place for tech elites as defined by PG and his minions. So I'm going back to the unwashed masses, even if it means having to read a few more titles about cat pictures. Best of luck, though, PG, and thanks for the great information this site has given me thus far. I will continue to follow your impressive career and your essays with great interest. <p>PS, Editors, feel free to change my title to ""Hacker News Rocks!""",1187388963

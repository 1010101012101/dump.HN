Every student <i>does</i> take the same class from the same professor. The professors can still calculate an ordinal rank order of the students because they have all the test grades.

The students love the policies because they claim it increases collaboration and teamwork, but my own experience suggests that the students also love not working hard. The undergrads at a place like Wharton (who have grade disclosure) often look for classes with loads of MBA students (who don't) because the MBA students pull the curve down.<p>When people are going to school to learn, I don't think removing grades will hurt performance, but learning can suffer when people go to school for credentials and a job.

Lower crime cities (Boston, San Francisco) have around 10X the rate, high crime cities (Baltimore, Philly, Detroit, DC) have had crime rates up to 100X.<p>City size has nothing to do with crime rates.  City size peaked in the 1950's, a time with much lower crime rates.  Philadelphia has a slightly smaller population now than in 1910.  Yet the homicide rate in 1911 was 4.4 per 100,000.  In 2006 it was 27.7.  Likewise the homicide rate in Baltimore went from 5.8 to 43.3.<p>Yes, homicide rates have come down a bit off their 1990 high.  But they are still nowhere near 1900 levels.  Also, homicide rates understate the violence problem.  The rate is partly kept down by people knowing to stay out of the city.<p>Finally, part of the awfulness of suburban design comes from dealing with the violence problem.  Most suburbs have strong zoning laws requiring large lots and no multi-family homes.  This is done explicitly to keep out the underclass.<p>If cities existed that combined strong law enforcement, school choice, and city-like urban design, I expect they would be extraordinarily popular.

Your grade should be EITHER the average (weighted, perhaps) of your homework and test scores (like most grades are now) OR the average of your test scores, whichever is higher.  This would allow people who understand the material to not waste time doing homework so long as their test scores are satisfactory.  Also, assignments and tests should be hard enough that getting a 50% on them isn't considered failing; grade inflation is rampant and frankly stupid.  Letter grades should be done away with, or only used as a shorthand way of expressing a final grade: making the tenth of a percent from 89.4 to 89.5 worth immensely more than the 9.4 percent from 80 to 89.4 is idiotic.  GPA should be done away with.

I'm guessing not, because of the obvious security issues.<p>Because I'm not always in front of my laptop, or desktop and don't have an iphone I use a system similar to what is here - different passwords for different sites, with a system that helps me remember them.",1233421751

Seriously, when I look at the time people waste making silly visualizations for commits done on some github project, or doing ""version control advocacy"", it blows my mind.<p>Why not do something to improve yourself, like learn C or Lisp, or port some sortware?",1233421563

Plus, they're both only 7-8 books long, so it won't take you forever to read them all (if you actually get into them).<p>Apprentice Adept is kind of a cool dual-world series, with sci-fi in one world and fantasy in the other, and the ability for some to move between them. You should start with the first in the series, of course: <i>Split Infinity.</i><p>Incarnations of Immortality also has the juxtaposition of sci-fi and fantasy, but in one world. The ""hook"" for this series is that the major ""forces"" in the world (time/death/fate/war/etc...) are actually offices which people fill (think <i>The Santa Clause</i>, but without Tim Allen or christmas). The first book of the series is <i>On A Pale Horse</i>.<p>A final word of warning: I read both of these series a long time ago, so it could be that they're actually not as mature as I remember =)",1233421529

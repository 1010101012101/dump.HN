6294896,comment,6293463,6293463,2,0,LekkoscPiwa,,,"The minimal wage that is mostly what is paid in WalMart and is about $15,000 a year. Let&#x27;s put it in historical perspective. In 1969 the minimal wage was $1.60. And in 1969 the price of ounce of silver was about $1.70.<p>In other words 40 years ago the minimal wage in the USA was about $22 USD using today&#x27;s silver price as an inflation indicator. Using 2013 data 22.00 USD is on par with average American hourly pay. This what was the minimal wage of 1969 became an average pay in 2013. So if you ever wonder why your grandad working single simple job could support his family with stay at home wife, 3 or 4 kids, have vacation house and literally no debt – that&#x27;s why. The average pay is 3 times lower today than it was 40 years ago when the real money – gold and silver – are used as an indicator. Of course some will point out to believe that gold and silver prices are in the bubble territory and that&#x27;s why my numbers don&#x27;t make any sense.<p>The problem with that reasoning is that gold is not experiencing bubble pricing. How do I know that? Because gold mining cost is at $1,200 with gold price merely covering it at $1,400. Bubbles are experienced in assets that sell by multiples of their real price, not the ones that are sold basically at the production cost. The staggering truth is that the current gold price simply reflects the high cost of living in the US today. The only correct conclusion seems to be that an average American worker is as poor today as minimal wage worker was 40 years ago.<p>No wonder fast-food strikes set for cities nationwide: <a href=""http://www.seattlepi.com/news/us/article/Fast-food-strikes-set-for-cities-nationwide-4770082.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seattlepi.com/news/us/article/Fast-food-strikes-s...</a>",1377765767

And of course, MySQL these days supports all these things (with InnoDB, an Oracle product) because these things weren&#x27;t there &quot;for lulz&quot; in commercial databases, they were there because people needed them and saw value in them. Now I am getting a complete sense of deja vu with MongoDB. It will <i>have</i> to add transactions. This is inevitable.

Indeed, when you look at the designs, you see that the information generated at pass issue time is either black or one other colour.  Thermal printers are already capable of this, as I suspect the OP is aware.

That level of automation is a good target imo. It&#x27;s also a great way to be certain that you can solve many issues remotely - since you can generally provide a meaningful chatbot command via mobile device.<p>In terms of scaling and cloud (aws) management, Asgard is awesome (seriously - if you&#x27;re on aws and haven&#x27;t checked it out, go now: <a href=""https://github.com/Netflix/asgard/wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Netflix/asgard/wiki</a>). The biggest complaint I have about Asgard as a tool, is it feels like more than most organizations need; because it is. My goal with the hubot-asgard scripts is to wrap some of the more essential features, and hide the bulk of the solution that many orgs just see as excess tooling.<p>There&#x27;s also the Cloud Prize...<p>If anyone is interested and needs assistance or wants particular features that aren&#x27;t wrapped yet (it&#x27;s still very young) I&#x27;d love to know.

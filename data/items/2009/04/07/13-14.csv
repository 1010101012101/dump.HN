I examine my code, and use logging to examine my assertions. If I <i>think</i> I know what the problem is, I will write a unit test to prove my assertion.<p>Doing it this way really makes you think about (and understand) what your code is doing. One of the side-effects of this is that it encourages me to write very small methods. Having small methods makes it easier for me to wrap my brain around what my code is doing.<p>I read years ago that Linus Torvalds also doesn't use a debugger, relying on debug statements. That was the catalyst for me beginning to do this myself.",1239112786

For example, I could see Amazon not being too happy with the example link <a href=""http://amazon.twi.bz/a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amazon.twi.bz/a</a>.<p>The other thing that I see is that for a URL shortener, the above is 22 characters.  What about if you were linking to a page here. For example, a link to this page is <a href=""http://ycombinator.twi.bz/b"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.twi.bz/b</a>.  That's 27 characters.<p>If you are going to use a URL shortener (not that I'm suggesting that it is a good idea), why use one that is so verbose (relatively speaking)?<p>So, I'm not sure that there is a sweet spot here.

Clojure data structures are immutable, and if you really want to do assignment, you need to explicitly use a ref/var/atom, which means you are going to figure out a way to write your program without assignment if at all possible.  Clojure, of course, is designed around functional programming that has many idioms to make assignment-less programming the natural way to do things.<p>I guess what this means is that Clojure can appeal to Python/Ruby/Perl hackers wanting to learn a different way to think about programming.",1239112547

And all 6 of these comments are either Techcrunch style ""Awesome article!"" comments or spam comments promoting some other site.<p>Community = comments/discussion and they appear to be struggling mightily on that front.<p>What's more likely is that Tipd is powered by autosubmission scripts scraping feeds they like.

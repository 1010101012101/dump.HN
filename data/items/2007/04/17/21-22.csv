You could learn python and just write C-style code in it in a few hours, but it might take much much longer to change the way you look at and solve problems to match the strengths of a language. \n",1176847050

I, and others I know, learned mostly from reading (docs, books, code, tutorials, etc.).  Great developers who are actually working don't want to be interrupted every time some inexperienced person needs help.<p>I also find presentations at conventions to often be painfully slow at conveying information.  I can read in 5 minutes what it takes a presenter 30 minutes to talk about, and further, I can get answers to specific questions that always pop up when a presentation glosses over the details.  Plus, if I already know something about it, I can just grab the knowledge ""diffs"" rather than sitting through 15 minutes of introduction.<p>Google is the #1 tool I use when programming.\n",1176846683

Google Calendar worked because planning and sharing events/meetings makes sense to be integrated with GMail.<p>As I've said before, I think this is going to be a different story because, while collaboration brings a lot of value to presentation software users, I can't see a killer app that Google can leverage beyond Image Search that would make their product a must-have.  Zenter has done a great job making a connected presentation app with a very slick Google Search-based image import tool.<p>Pound for pound, I think Zenter has a fighting chance as long as it keeps innovating on the feature front.  Don't forget that collaborative presentations will likely give rise to a slide sharing community (i.e. slideshare.net), so there's more to online presentation software than the app itself.",1176845860

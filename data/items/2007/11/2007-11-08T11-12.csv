77445,story,,,7,11,Tichy,"Idea for Facebook App: ""Lobby""",,"This idea grew out of my frustration with a company who refuses to repair my mobile phone. Obviously I will end my contract with that company, and so will my girl-friend. Perhaps some of my friends will, too? What if I could post my grudges against some companies on my Facebook profiles, and contacts who trust me enough would also commit to actions (ie cancel their contracts, avoid products from that company). The application could sum the expected damages for the evil company. <p>What do you think? I fear some legal problems, and maybe it is too negative. On the other hand being powerless against the big corporations is also a very negative feeling. I admit that I am motivated by anger here...<p>Another question is how often do such frustrations occur?  Maybe I was just extremely unlucky, and in general the corporations don't abuse their power?",1194522899

Sorry I came off harsh.<p>I was not questioning whether a ""really good relationship""
was a good foundation for selecting a co-founder.<p>I was questioning whether a one night project signifies
a ""really good relationship"".<p>It may or may not.<p>I think the OP had many great insights and I 
enjoyed reading his post.<p>Also, W3STS1D3 4 L1F3!!

77441,comment,77246,77295,0,0,davidw,,,"This sounds like good advice to me.  This YC requirement has led to something akin to ""cargo cult cofounders"" - getting someone else involved because it's ""better that way"".  While I tend to think it <i>is</i> better to have one, it has to be the right person, not some random dude who you barely know.  It's sort of a catch 22 in that it's got to be someone you've already known for a while when you start looking or discussing the idea of doing a company.",1194520929

77438,comment,77246,77373,0,0,Dauntless,,,"First, what dual engine and single engine planes have to do with PG's comparison? He was referring to the fact that if a component of a thing statically represents the number one problem (for example the car's engine breaking down), it doesn't mean you should remove that component (the engine).<p>Secondly, while I agree with you that if you planned everything by yourself and are willing to do it alone, you shouldn't just look for co-founder when you can start implementing by yourself with some employees. But I got to warn you that's pretty extreme and may get you looking like a 70 year old when you are 25 very fast, because of the exhaustion it causes to run a big venture by yourself.<p>I don't know statistics either and I would like to put [citation needed] everywhere I look on the internet but a two men team has more potential on the long run then an one man army because the two founders motivate each other, share problems and have a larger knowledge base to solve them, make it more fun and pleasing to work on a startup.
I like your post because you raze awareness regarding the importance of having good cofounders. Anyway some people like to work alone one and they do it better that way, but I think most men might fall apart on such high pressure, especially if they don't have previous experience in making startups.<p>One more thing is that it's very hard to find good employees that are willing to work at a startup, even harder to pay them while you don't have any revenues in site.

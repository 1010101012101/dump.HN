</code></pre>
In particular, ab should be avoided whenever possible.  Apache Bench (ab) remains a single-threaded tool, meaning that for high-performance servers in particular, your exercise will run into the limits of Apache Bench before the limits of the server(s) being tested.  The LigHTTP team has a multi-threaded clone named WeigHTTP that I would recommend if you want something that is functionally similar to ab and uses similar command-line arguments.<p>Wrk uses a slightly different argument syntax from ab and WeigHTTP but has some upsides:<p>1. Wrk is also multi-threaded.<p>2. In our experience, wrk is slightly higher-performance than WeigHTTP (~5 to 10%).<p>3. Wrk provides average, maximum, and stdev for latency.<p>4. Wrk provides a time-limited mode (rather than request-count limited), which is appealing for some test types.<p>In my experience, as long as you configure Go and node to use all of your cores, Go will benchmark better than Node in any permutation of these configuration variables:<p><pre><code>    Go 1.0.2 and node tested with ab.
    Go 1.1 and node tested with ab.
    Go 1.0.2 and node tested with wrk.
    Go 1.1 and node tested with wrk.

V8 is a very fast JavaScript runtime; node.js is modestly quick at handling HTTP requests.  But among the many features of Go is a high-performance HTTP package.  If you&#x27;ve used both, it isn&#x27;t all that surprising that Go&#x27;s performance clocks in higher than node.",1376492393

A password entry system that logs in to a full-privilege profile when the user is in a geofenced location, and that drops to a more limited user profile if the correct password is used outside of the set location.

Indeed, it is very unpopular among many people.<p>German politicians, in the past (60s,70s,80s), have brought in many worker-immigrants mainly from turkey. They were badly needed to fill the many vacant spots in the booming economy.<p>They left no thought to integrating / assimilating them into the german society.
Up until the 1990s the political parties in germany could not even come to grips with the fact that germany was in fact an &quot;immmigration country&quot;. They were in denial.<p>Today germany has 12-14% foreigners, mostly from turkey, and many of them have not been integrated well into the german society.
Also, unemployment is high among this group. Education chances are depressed, etc - you get the picture.<p>Now, we are in a bind.
On the one hand the birth rate has been dropping for decades.
This has to do with societal trends (more women working, etc) - but is a complicated issue in itself.<p>Only group with a healthy birth rate, ironically, are the turkish immigrants.<p>Politicians do not have any idea what to do about the birthrate.
That has to with a cultural memory of nazi-era family policies, which rewarded having many children. It&#x27;s a taboo today in german politics to try to directly induce families to have more children in any way.<p>The german economy is already suffering. The term &quot;fachkräftemangel&quot; has been coined for this- which means the industry is already finding it difficult to fill all the vacant spots with <i>qualified</i> personell.",1376492075

  Did pan on screen with x fingers, y hands
  Did tap with x fingers, y hands
  Did rotate with x fingers, y hands
  Did pinch with x fingers, y hands

These libraries make it easy to create a WPF or a Cocoa Mac OS X application for manipulating and using the Leap Motion. These are built on top of the Leap SDK, and a level of abstraction up.

Their own app (Touchless) uses a difficult &quot;poke&quot; gesture for clicking vs. some other coarse and easily-detectable gesture.<p>The one thing that Leap has going for it is though is that it is small and positioned under the wrist, which means that installation is super-easy, and at some point it will be built into some laptops and keyboards. This means it will likely do better in the consumer space.

If the population drops too much, the social safety net for retirees becomes insolvent.  You can, of course, do the opposite of adding new workers: simply cause every new worker to pay more than the previous worker - but at what point do workers decide it&#x27;s simply not worth it to work, when so much of their income is being spent paying for earlier retirees?<p>It&#x27;s a balancing act for sure.  Previously, most western countries enjoyed a population growth, which meant more workers paying in than taking out, as this trend is reversing in nearly all western countries, it will be interesting to see how each country deals with it.  In the U.S. the focus is on immigration and putting additional limits on what one can take out of the system - I&#x27;m not entirely sure that this is the right response, but I don&#x27;t think simply ratcheting costs up on tomorrow&#x27;s workers is the right answer either.<p>As to robotics, well, that&#x27;s a whole &#x27;nother basket to deal with.

Where once the only low-skilled jobs available were heavy labor and highly fungible services, we could create whole new classes of jobs relating to less fungible services (e.g. hyper-localized services), and with the possibilities of expansion off of the planet - there will be many opportunities for new work.

Other fighters are restricted to subsonic speeds except for short supersonic dashes.<p>Total thrust is not particularly interesting for a fighter&#x27;s performance, thrust-to-weight ratio is, and the F-35 is quite a bit heavier.  The F-16 has slightly better than 1:1 &quot;loaded&quot;, with the F-35 only getting there by restricting it to 50% fuel.<p>I am not sure how exactly combat radius is calculated, but the combat radius of the F-16 is listed as half of that of the F-35 and to get decent thrust-to-weight you have to halve to F-35&#x27;s fuel.  Go figure.<p>One more thing to consider is that the combat radius appears to be with internal fuel only.  The F-35 being a stealth design, it has been &quot;optimized&quot; for internal carriage of weapons and fuel, whereas with the F-16 you probably just add a drop-tank if you need more range.",1376491889

Certainly it would in some areas, but eventually if a given open-source project were consistently out-competing a proprietary product, the business being disadvantaged could fork the whole thing at once and turbocharge its now-proprietary development for long enough to supplant the old, open version.<p>Witness what Nokia did with Qt. They poured tons of money into it and turned it in a short time into a mobile-class toolkit that was even more the &quot;Best of Breed&quot;. They had so much resource investment that they were able to relicense the whole thing from GPL/QPL to LGPL/QPL. That particular case has turned out alright, but it should be illustrative of the danger of a world with a weak F/OSS ecosystem.<p>Given all the problems we still have with software patents and other IP shenanigans I simply can&#x27;t rest on the idea that the mere technical superiority of development &quot;in the open&quot; must necessarily and inevitably lead to a world where software is open and available to the users who would need it, without the judicious use of copyleft licenses in the mix along with BSD/MIT-style licenses.

(Disclaimer: I am not a professional cryptographer, but I know something about crypto-complexity).<p>Many proofs in cryptography start with the following assumption: assume x is a bitstring of length N drawn from a uniformly random distribution of bit strings. This assumption is then used as the basis of the proof of the cryptographic construct.<p>For instance in a provably secure stream cipher you start with that assumption then proceed to show that if weak one-way-functions exist then you can construct a secure pseudo random number generator that is polynomially indistinguishable from a true random source. You then use your assumed random bit string, x, as the key to the psuedo random number generator to generate a one time pad to XOR with your message.<p>Since the secure psuedo random number generator is indistinguishable from a true random number generator (by a polynomial attacker) the message is secure (from a polynomial attacker). However, this is all predicated on the key being drawn from a uniform distribution. If the key is NOT drawn from a uniform distribution than there may be a potential speed-up available to the attacker.<p>What the paper shows is that often it is assumed that words drawn from an IID distribution of letters can be treated as if the distribution of words is uniform (given a sufficiently large word size). However, this distribution while very flat is not quite uniform. They show how this can be exploited using the &quot;Guesswork&quot; framework to come up with a tighter bound on the time it would take to guess a chosen word. This bound is much better than the traditional bound used.<p>What this means is that there needs to be more margin given than previously thought when dealing with keys derived from non-uniform distributions. Such keys include passwords.",1376491858

As per the question, I tend to go towards Node with Express. It doesn&#x27;t do all the abstractions in terms of controllers and associations in models, though - so development is not as quick for trivial apps.<p>One reason I choose Node over Ruby/Rails is the Websocket libraries available in Node. Here&#x27;s an example of why: I&#x27;ve been exploring a lot of JavaScript lately. Backbone.js is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t have nice data-binding. Angular.js is really nice, but it&#x27;s &quot;templates&quot; (directives) cannot be parsed by a server, so you couldn&#x27;t serve the same content from the server. Ember is nice, but it&#x27;s a little slow compared to the other frameworks (from my experience with it, I know it will improve).<p>I prefer Backbone + Handlebars because I can serve the same templates as views from the server if I adhere to a rule that essentially means each page of the app is a separate Backbone template associated with it&#x27;s own view. These can still have subviews, but the client will handle that. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the data binding.<p>So, lately in my apps, I&#x27;ve found myself writing simple data binding &quot;plugins&quot;. But instead of detecting regular events - I bring socket.io into the mix. This makes for really fast data binding, plus everyone can see the changes.<p>Having everything in JavaScript prevents me from straying between different programming languages and distracts me less, and for the socket work it just makes so much more sense to me.",1376491611

Here are a few questions that I don&#x27;t know the answer to, but seem a lot more interesting:<p>- Do we have studies that estimate the effect of lateral acceleration on motion sickness? What do they indicate (e.g. 0.1% of passengers get it at 4 m/s^2, 2% at 5 m/s^2 etc.)?<p>- To what extent is motion sickness in HSR comparable to the proposed system? Are the differences (no outside visibility, different vibrations model, possibly different seating) significant and if so how?<p>- To what extent do potential passengers care about motion sickness? Has anyone compared cost and convenience trade-offs for systems with different expectations of motion sickness e.g. ferry vs. train? How comfortable are passengers with self-medication in such contingencies?<p>Etc. And motion sickness is only one of hundreds of possible serious weaknesses in this project. But this is inherent in anything that hasn&#x27;t been tried before; anyone can think of hundreds of ways in which it can go wrong.

I am not arguing one way or the other on where the money comes from.<p>> AMC Networks requires that cable providers (Comcast, RCN, Time Warner, DirecTV etc) carry WeTV and IFC at $0.25/subscriber, even though they are unpopular, and carry AMC at $0.75/subscriber.<p>> Cable providers pretty much have to comply, so they can get AMC. As a result, AMC Networks makes up losses on AMC proper with subscription revenues from the unwanted channels.<p>Assuming that that is basically true, then if WeTV and IFC are losing money (before considering subscription fees), then AMC is really just charging $1.25/subscriber for AMC proper (the thing cable cos want) making a profit, and <i>subsidizing</i> WeTV and IFC with it.<p>If the subsidy works the other way, then the bundling works around the fact that what to <i>consumers</i> is actually desirable enough to be profitable isn&#x27;t what cable cos want for some reason, which is <i>possible</i> if what viewers actually <i>watch</i> and what viewers look for in selecting cable providers are not aligned, but a counterintuitive enough claim that some evidence should be provided for it.",1376490634

I&#x27;ve used both Android and iOS over time, but in the end, many small things just let me prefer iOS, even though it&#x27;s probably completely subjective at this point.<p>The biggest lock-in to iOS is iMessage though and I hate Apple for that as it makes it next to impossible for me to ever not use an iOS device as my phone any more: When you move your SIM card from an iOS device to a non-iOS device, there&#x27;s a period of time during which Apple accepts iMessages for your number, especially when you have other devices configured with iMessage. At this point, people sending you an iMessage (it&#x27;s not as if they get to chose) will think that the message is delivered (it might even say &quot;delivered&quot;), when in fact nothing the like has happened.<p>Worse: Even once this settles and apple&#x27;s server stop accepting iMessages to a number, now the sender will see green chat bubbles instead of blue ones. This has caused me so much grief with non-technical iOS users, believing that something went wrong with delivering the message, causing them to call me after nearly every message they sent (&quot;the bubble didn&#x27;t look the same. did you get my message?&quot;)<p>This is an ugly mess and I don&#x27;t see any motivation for Apple to fix it as it only punishes those who don&#x27;t use iOS, never those using iOS.<p>The other big thing is visual voice mail which I really like and so far is not supported by Android (aside of some crappy carrier specific apps) even though in most cases it&#x27;s just audio-files-over-imap that&#x27;s powering the secret sauce under iOS.",1376490554

I didn&#x27;t look through his references, but he also has an update showing how assuming that pylon costs are going to be linear in the weight is not consistent with the hyperloop document itself.<p>I had to reread the update a few times, but the argument is: the proposal contains two versions, for passengers and for cars. The car version will weigh more and cost more, but the cost increase is much less percentage-wise than the weight increase, so the hyperloop designers themselves don&#x27;t believe that pylon will be linear in the weight.<p>As I said elsewhere, this is why references are not just a formality.

Also, it has to work a lot harder in 100F+ heat. It&#x27;s a really good system, but it&#x27;s also a relatively small cabin. Compared to my previous Jeep Grand Cherokee or Volvos it&#x27;s performance isn&#x27;t really noteworthy. It&#x27;s definitely not worse, but I&#x27;d be hard pressed to claim it&#x27;s substantially better either.<p>My commute to the office is 5 miles each way. So the Leaf is about perfect for me. I still take the 20+ mile trip (each way) downtown, or up to the suburbs to visit friends on weekends without any worries.<p>Another guy at the office who also has a Leaf has a 30 mile commute (each way), and he&#x27;s also on the trickle charger. A few close calls early on, but he seemed to adjust to it pretty quick.<p>BTW, 60 miles round trip is pretty extraordinary for a commute. Even in the sprawling sub-sub-suburbs of TX. I&#x27;d guess that the Leaf would work fine for more people than not on a commuting basis. But that&#x27;s just my gut.<p>The only frustrating thing I&#x27;ve run into is the high cost of DC Quick Charger subscriptions (none of the ones deployed around here are pay-by-the-minute, you have to be a member). I didn&#x27;t drop a $200/month gas bill just to pay $80/month for a Quick Charger membership I&#x27;d only use once a month at best.<p>It might be worth it if there were any quick-chargers between Dallas and Houston so I could visit family in Galveston, but there&#x27;s absolutely nothing, and even if the state gets around to putting Level2 chargers in at rest-stops, who&#x27;s going to want to stop twice for 4 hours each at rest-stops along the way? That&#x27;d turn a 5 hour trip into 14.<p>So we take my wife&#x27;s SUV instead. As a two-car family with a short commute the Leaf really isn&#x27;t much of a compromise at all. I&#x27;m about to buy a Level2 charger for home, but it&#x27;s not really necessary. It&#x27;s more about once-in-a-blue-moon convenience of a very busy weekend and getting to leave the SUV in the driveway.

The wikipedia article is fairly good, although short.<p>Those who don&#x27;t learn history are doomed to repeat it.<p>The F-4 lesson was &quot;everyone knew&quot; that ever more expensive and technologically advanced munitions were the way to go, so no gun pod just drop missiles.  (missiles are essentially somewhat dumb short range drones, although there&#x27;s a lot of overlap in the categories...)  Turned out to be a near disaster and they ended up bolting a human operated gun to the F-4.  People actually died because of this design mistake.

Try haskell or ocaml or clean or SML sometime.  You have to have a clear and consistent model of what you are doing in order for your code to type check.  I can&#x27;t count the number of times I&#x27;ve had my incorrect thinking about a problem be forced out of me during the initial development by the compiler.<p>>Not least because if you really want to, writing test cases and type checks to enforce typing is trivial to do in dynamic languages too<p>No, it is actually a huge pain, you need to write a type checker.  Writing a &quot;is this an int?&quot; test does not give you the assurance of type checking.  That only finds out if the value happened to be an int under that particular execution of the application.  A type checker completely guarantees that there is no way for it to be the wrong type ever.  Even if the only thing static typing got you was the complete elimination of NULL/nil exceptions, it would be worth it.  But it gets you way more than that.",1376489567

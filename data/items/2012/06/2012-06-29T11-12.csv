4176173,comment,4175646,4175844,6,0,lclarkmichalek,,,"Any reason they can ""fuck off""? Anyway, you're incorrect about pypy. ""Real"" python developers will likely not run their code in a sandboxed environment, so PyPy's security advantages are minimal, added to the fact that your sandbox is only as good as its configuration. The concurrency is interesting, but there are numerous other solutions available, and that alone makes it unlikely that the de facto implementation of the language would include one. Claiming that PyPy is better on compatibility than CPython is ridiculous; last time I looked, anything using a C extension had to be rewritten to use ctypes. On speed, yes PyPy is impressive. But in python, anything that is particularly CPU intensive should probably be written as a C extension and PyPy takes a hit when using ctypes iirc. In general, I don't see the point of people trying to optimize generic python code. Most code never gets profiled, and most code isn't a problem. At least, not a problem enough to switch interpreter. Definitely not a problem enough to ignore the massive problem that is python 2.x's unicode implementation.",1340970625

4176162,comment,4176075,4176075,10,0,mgkimsal,,,"""make the alternatives so outstanding that the choice of the better hammer becomes obvious.""<p>There's a lot of <i>frameworks</i> that make many types of web site or web app development easier than PHP.  There aren't any <i>languages</i> that were created <i>explicitly</i> with the goal of being used to create web pages (and later, by extension, web sites).  OK, there might be a few that have gone by the wayside (ihtml, htmlos, etc), but nothing mainstream.<p>PHP is ""content-type: text/html"" by default, which can be overridden for other tasks.  Everything else needs to make some adaptation (however subtle) to 'play' with HTML.  Potentially something like mod_ruby or mod_python could take off, but probably not even then, as you'd be worrying about including base library stuff or extra modules, the majority of which are already baked in to PHP (gd, etc).<p>You have a web page up and just want to add a dynamic copyright date to the bottom?  Copyright <?=date(""Y"");?> and change extension to .php (or play with some mod_rewrite rules on apache).  Want to capture the output of every HTML page and rewrite some links (while logging those changes to a db?)?  automatically prepend a php ob_start() call then append an ob_get_clean() function in the footer, then process away.<p>Doing these sorts of things in any other tech stack requires a lot more configuration and meddling, or possibly rewriting core site code.  PHP can scale down to be nice additional decoration in a site, or can power the whole thing soup to nuts (and can scale up much easier than some other platforms can scale down).<p>Related: I recently had a basic site and needed to rethink it in terms of mobile toolkit.  It was much easier to take what I had an add in jquery Mobile stuff than it was to work with Sencha (as one example) because other tools like Sencha assumed I was starting greenfield, which I wasn't, and I didn't have time to learn enough of their stack to try to extract the bits I wanted.  jQuery made it easy to add the bits I wanted, and PHP does that for HTML/serverside aspects of things as well.",1340970349

Then finally full user support.<p>In general, one thing PHP excels at adding the '1% dynamic' to an existing static website.

But it requires writing several times as much code, runs about 20% of the speed and consumes most of the CPU to do simple tasks.<p>For example, lets say you want to create a little green radar HUD map for where enemies are on a battlefield in front of you. In AS3 you can make each enemy dot be a sprite, and move them individually when necessary. You can mask them when they reach the edge of the HUD, fade them out when they disappear. When you turn left or right, they all turn together. Because of how Flash's graphics engine works, only the graphical areas that are changed in each frame are actually redrawn; this is all handled at a very low level and the speed is close to native; it can also be coded to take advantage of a GPU.<p>To accomplish the same thing in Javascript and Canvas, you have to write an engine that tracks where each of those things is in global space. To draw little rectangles at different rotations within the same canvas, you actually have to rotate <i>the canvas</i>, draw the rectangle, then unrotate the canvas. Once you've got this engine written, you still have to redraw the entire canvas with your engine deciding how to draw each pixel, square or circle, one by one, with <i>every single frame</i>. To get around that, you write another engine that determines which areas are changing and only redraws those. But then you have to decide what to do when overlapping objects are in front of or behind that area, so now you've written a scene graph, z-order and a traverser, and possibly parent-child relationships, from scratch. Fine, but you realize that the traverser, running as it is in <i>untyped</i> javascript without the benefit of typed iterators like vectors, can't handle more than a dozen objects before it's hogging up even more of the CPU than if you just redrew the whole stupid canvas every single frame.<p>So, all this behavior is necessary for any game. Good coders are struggling to make these things playable in HTML5 to keep the mobile market happy, but to do that you have to cut a lot of corners. The game quality's obviously lower, and the games are slower than they would be in AS3. It's just unavoidable. People who don't know how computers work then complain that Flash is so slow, etc. because of the perception of sloppily coded banners and stuff. But when the same exact things are written in Javascript and Canvas they are <i>much, much slower</i>.",1340968375

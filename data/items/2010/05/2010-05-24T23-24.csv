1376013,comment,1375528,1375943,0,0,Dove,,,"There is not a simple answer to the conundrum, but I agree with xenophanes in my preference: I would rather working relationships remained totally voluntary, however stupid people's reasoning may be.<p>You are right that when unfair discrimination (or any stupid opinion in general) is widespread, the result is unjust--and can even cross the line from annoyance to injury.  Small affronts can add up to oppression; death by a thousand cuts.  I wish there were a form of redress beyond making papercuts illegal (something I'd rather not do).<p>The main consolation I see is that making the action illegal may not help much except in marginal cases.  If the law says one thing and society widely believes another, the latter is going to rule what actually happens--either through legislative change or jury selection or selective reporting or something.  I believe the only real secure refuge from widespread discrimination is victory in the court of public opinion.  One must rely on the natural justice of the cause and prove naysayers wrong.<p>It is not complete protection, but I think it more just than the alternative: making a particular <i>motivation</i> for hiring or firing illegal.  It is important to me that economic transactions be totally voluntary for both parties.  And it is very important to me that private people be able to hold and act upon stupid beliefs.  The invasion becomes particularly evident if I turn the situation around: Would I want to defend my actions before a court?  Would I want a lawyer examining my motivation behind hiring this plumber, quitting that job, or buying a third car, to ensure they are not tainted by some vestige of racism?  Heaven forbid!<p>I don't have a great answer for it.  But I think, weighing the two harms, I would rather suffer under misguided, widespread discrimination than permit the courts to question the beliefs and motivations that go into a private transaction.  The former is an evil that I think I am willing to consciously accept as the price of the latter freedom.",1274745184

1375911,comment,1374635,1375516,0,0,crux_,,,"> To be more specific, when I want to transform a collection given by a Java library in a functional manner, I usually ended up with one or two localized import statements - to avoid e.g. scala.collection.mutable leaking into my other methods - and additional calls to convert the Java collection into a Scala specific and back again.<p>I think the other poster was right about this being more of a library issue than a language issue. In my experience it was rare to do more than wrap Java collections to or from an Iterable[]; that could be done easily without having to bring full mutable collections into the namespace.<p>Also, it might be part of the cost of working with ""enterprise"" Java, but it was actually really rare for me to work with a vanilla Java collection rather than some library's implementation of its own damn 'typesafe' iterator, like this: <a href=""http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-j/apiDocs/org/w3c/dom/NodeList.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-j/apiDocs/org/w3c/dom/NodeLi...</a>. It was super-nice to toss together my own wrappers of some library or another's semi-standard iteration API and have a ton of functionality come along via the magic of mixins; and get it all automatically applied for the cost of a single import statement via implicits.<p>> match { case x: List[Foo] => ... case x: List[Bar] => ... }<p>I suppose such a thing is made impossible via erasure, it's true. I haven't encountered a need for it -- maybe because the problem there is erasure + dynamic/runtime typing, rather than erasure on its own. Also it's something that's coming for Scala, it sounds like. (I haven't paid as much attention as I should to its ongoing development..)<p>> Why do you have the preference for Scala?<p>Part of it's just the intuitive feel: When I code in Scala, I'm writing in Scala -- it might be a fairly huge language, but it is its own thing. Coding in F# feels like bouncing back and forth between C# and O'Caml, depending on how functional you're feeling at the moment -- here's a C#-ish clause; there's an O'caml-esque one.<p>As an example, I don't believe you can use both inheritance and discriminated unions in F#. In Scala you can and it's actually quite useful.<p>Another example is that in F# you can omit type declarations on function arguments until you start using OO, then they become mandatory and infect your code. On the one hand the extra inference is nice but on the other it really drives home that you are coding in two languages, not one.<p>Besides that intuitive part, I think that Scala's module/class-level type system, although complicated, helps tremendously for writing big, complex, programs. Traits/mixins, flexibility in type constraints, and allowing types as members of other types add up to a really powerful ability to modularize without sacrificing. At least for me, a lot of my older O'Caml projects made fairly heavy use of functors. F# didn't bother to try to support the idea and only supports plain-vanilla C# interfaces. Scala embraced them, extended it, and made them much better.",1274742630

Those subsidies are either in the form of rebates for purchases, rebates in the form of artificially high electricity buyback prices, or more favourable tax treatment or other perks (electric cars & city parking, for example)<p>While the political winds are blowing in your favour it might be plain sailing, but any business that does not have a fundamental basis in return on investment without subsidy is highly risky.  With the endless talk of reining in government spending in countries all around the world, any industry relying on government subsidies to keep it afloat has a large risk factor of cuts to those subsidies resulting from a switch in government.<p>Exceptions to this are probably in personalised, high end sales and consulting to wealthy businesses and individuals who want the technology for the wow factor.

For instance in the 70s and 80s, disk drives were judged entirely on size.  So a smaller size of disk was necessarily worse.  And this resulted in waves of companies wiped out.  In mobile devices today, people care more about portability, ruggedness, and power consumption.  So a smaller disk may actually be better.  Therefore whether a smaller drive is better or worse depends entirely on the context set by the market it is entering.<p>In the examples you are thinking of, simpler frequently does equate to worse.  If the existing companies have sales pitches that are geared towards lists of checkboxes on feature sets, then I guarantee that simpler equates to worse.  And yes, this is an advantage for the startup.  (Assuming that it can make itself lean enough to live on the scraps at the bottom of the market.)<p>The underlying dynamic is that existing companies find it hard to compete at the low end of their market for a variety of reasons.  One of which is that companies tend to develop infrastructures that depend on having certain profit margins.  Relative to how the company is structured, the bottom of the market is always unprofitable.  Conversely companies always find the top end of their market very enticing.<p>However technology tends to improve at a faster rate than the market's needs increase.  So the crappy cheap solution naturally grows up into a sufficient solution.  The providers of the cheap solution happily eat up the market, and at every step the incumbents have a hard time defending it.  And so incumbents get driven out of the top of the market.<p>This dynamic is frequently recognized while it is happening, but for deep organizational reasons it is really, <i>really</i> hard to change.",1274742327

It's definitely accurate for being a professor at a top-tier research university in the sciences or engineering. A prof job at those kinds of places could accurately be titled ""research manager"": the main job requirements are managing and bringing in funding for a fairly large research lab of 5-10 grad students and possibly some research scientists and postdocs.<p>But you can shift the balance of the various components if you go to different kinds of schools. To take the opposite end of the spectrum, if you're the CS prof at a small liberal-arts college, your job will involve a lot more teaching and mentoring undergrads, and a lot less grant-writing and research-lab management. It's unfortunately not true that there's a happy medium to fit every kind of temperament, but there are <i>some</i> options at least.",1274742289

At Carnegie Mellon, it's basically the same as a normal Professor (tenured, similar prestige, etc.), except that you don't normally teach, and in return, you're expected to fund a portion of your own salary out of the grants you bring in. (If you don't bring in grants some year, you can fall back on teaching to earn your keep, so research profs do occasionally teach.)",1274742060

I'm unable to find the link currently, but a prime example of why I'll never sign up to Verizon again is just this.

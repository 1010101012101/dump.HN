9472867,comment,9471643,9471643,0,0,jkire,,,"> I do not believe that there is data that is &quot;not important enough to encrypt&quot;.<p>I <i>do</i> believe this. When I visit a static web page over SSL people sniffing my connection are almost always going to have a good idea of which domain I&#x27;m looking at (either by IP, or the DNS requests I just fired off, etc.), so the attackers know what content I&#x27;m seeing. So why encrypt it? The benefit is that we can trust that static content really did come from that domain and wasn&#x27;t changed by a MitM, but this can be solved by simply including a signature of the content rather than encrypting everything.<p>SSL is really not cheap CPU wise; it can limit the usefulness of a small, personal, cheap VPS for hosting even moderately popular content. Signing static content is essentially free, since we can pre-compute them.<p>If the writer really does believe everything should be encrypted (this necessarily includes metadata), then I assume he would advocate Mozilla deprecate supporting for non-Tor connections? :)",1430499573

The work you are doing to day will be bitrotted away to nohthing in five or ten years. The relationships you have will grow and change, and just as surely they will die, or the people you have them with wil die, or you will die.<p>The appeal of religion is that it&#x27;s a trick that allows people to live with this reality, but the cost is extremely high. The challenge for those of us unwilling to accept the epistemic and moral compromises religion entails is to find ways for our lives to be meaningful that don&#x27;t require quite such massive self-deception or accepting even a tiny bit of moral authority based on things that &quot;just made sense&quot; to pre-modern high-status men who knew less about the world than the average intelligent high-school student today.<p>Looking inward--meditating and whatnot--doesn&#x27;t help much on the transience issue, because everythat that you are will also pass away. It can help on some practical things, though, including developing an awareness of all the good things we have simply by being clever enough to be born in the right time and place.<p>Looking outward, to help others, to contribute to the world, to develop a braoder network of social connections that are not purely self-indulgence (although a life without self-indulgence is a life not worth living) can help, although it comes with all the frustrations of dealing with human beings. No good deed goes unpunished.<p>I&#x27;m not a natural helper or teacher of others, but I&#x27;ve found the greatest satisfactions in my life have come from mentoring and managing in ways that make people&#x27;s lives a bit better. One of the things that makes that work is an awareness that if I help someone learn something, the good I&#x27;ve done will last. The potential positive effect of mentoring goes on pretty much indefinitely, long after I&#x27;ve been laid-off from my job or my project has been shelved or my girlfriend has dumped me or my marriage has ended or my friends have died or all the other things that really do happen to people in the course of a long, full and successful life.",1430499140

A programmer should understand the hammers of the programming world (C), the flathead screwdrivers of the programming world (python), the phillips head screwdrivers of the programming world (SQL), the power jigsaws of the programming world (prolog), the needlenose vice-grips of the programming world (awk), and even some of the nylon jeweler&#x27;s mallets of the programming world (erlang, haskell, befunge) in the same way that you would expect even a relatively mediocre mechanic to recognize and understand the use of all these tools.<p>A language is a single tool. Concepts are concepts, and you can apply concepts with inappropriate tools just fine (you can write object-oriented code in c or functional code in java the same way you can remove a bolt with vice grips or hammer in a nail with the handle of a chainsaw).",1430498468

9472653,comment,9471524,9471524,0,0,yojo,,,"I had the benefit of working with Geoff Ralston. He likes to tell founders this: &quot;Startups don&#x27;t fail because they run out of money, startups fail because their founders give up.&quot; It sounds trite, but the insight is generally applicable. You do not fail when a project or string of projects is bad, you fail when you stop trying to succeed at the next one.<p>A few thoughts:<p>1) There is a dangerous trap for people who are pegged as &quot;smart&quot;. The logic is this: You are smart, therefore you do well at things. If you are told this enough, you start to reverse it in your head: &quot;You do well at things, therefore you are smart.&quot; If you take that as true, what happens when you do poorly at something? Does that mean you&#x27;re not actually smart?<p>The key thing to remember is that everyone starts off bad at everything. Everyone. Everything. You get better by trying and learning. At this point in your life you should optimize for speed of learning. Know that you will have projects that are objectively bad and failed to meet their stated goals. Also know that if you never fail an attempt, you are not working at the edge of your ability, and you are not learning as fast as you could be.<p>2) Humans are social animals.  You are stuck with this, so I encourage you to learn to live with it.  You can think rationally about it all day long, but the chimp platform you&#x27;re built on is always going to measure your self-worth by the strength of your social network and your place in its hierarchy. Go join a groups of people with like-interests. It will be very hard, and you will probably feel constantly nervous and awkward. You will be bad at socializing. But each time you try, you will get a little better. And you won&#x27;t fail unless you give up.",1430498064

The only way any of this will improve is if it first gets worse for the average Joe. Unfortunately by then it will be too late and the situation will have so badly deteriorated that they only solution is to burn everything to the ground before starting fresh.

Morality is absent from the decision making process when it comes to warfare. If killing a million Saudis were the answer, they&#x27;d be dead.<p>Technology has made it possible (or necessary) for non nation-state actors to levy something very similar to war against nation-states.<p>In the case of a nation-state in the industrial and post-industrial age, the approach is straightforward -- you engage the enemy in the field AND destroy his ability to make war. The US Civil War was the dress-rehearsal for this, and WW1 explored the limits of what could be done before the innovations of the 20th century were fully baked.<p>Today, you can&#x27;t have total war, because tools exist to permanently execute a total war -- nuclear weapons. So we fight in the fringes by arming various individuals and engaging in an evolved form of guerrilla warfare.<p>I think that history will conclude that the last decade and a half has been a process of the ultimate, seemingly omni-potent superpower figuring out how to scale down its war machine down as low as the individual actor.",1430497550

We work at a scale where seemingly small improvements can have a big impact. You&#x27;ll be working right in the heart of the profit center.<p>Our division of Connexity works in online display advertising through RTB, and run 50 to 100 million impressions each day. Our total transaction volume is between 5 and 10 billion per day. You&#x27;ve probably got our cookies in your browser, and we&#x27;ve served ads on nearly every site you&#x27;ve ever visited.<p>We&#x27;re primarily looking for someone to contribute to our Rails app. It&#x27;s used to administer hundreds of advertising campaigns across hundreds of publisher sites. It&#x27;s not just boring CRUD. It&#x27;s the heart of our display advertising business.  The business folks will know you and have a tremendous amount of appreciation for your work.<p>This role is a great way to learn advertising tech as well as other tools.  In addition to the conventional Rails work, you&#x27;d get hands on experience with Redis, Hbase, PostgreSQL, and Scala. Several on the team started in the Rails app and have moved into other areas of interest (low-latency RTB bidder written in C or sophisticated reporting and optimization). Not really possible to get bored around here unless you&#x27;re a boring person.<p>Our team is sharp and works well together. We enjoy perks such as paid lunch, a 9/80 schedule (to get every other Friday off) and unlimited vacation; the culture of our team recognizes and respects the importance of your non-work life. Also, Ventura county is a pretty nice place to live/work.\nIf you&#x27;ve got Rails or other relevant web app experience, that&#x27;s a good start. More importantly, you&#x27;ll be eager to learn display advertising inside and out.<p>Unless you prefer to start with a HR-oriented chat, you can reach me (a lead engineer on the team) at david.larsen@connexity.com.",1430497001

9472477,comment,9471524,9471908,0,0,enraged_camel,,,">>Aim to be more well-rounded.<p>Not sure if I agree. Being &quot;well-rounded&quot; will result in being mediocre at everything, i.e. jack-of-all-trades-but-master-of-none. If you want to excel at something, you need to specialize and focus on that thing, usually to the exclusion of a lot of other things. Einstein wasn&#x27;t &quot;well-rounded&quot; but he no doubt lived a fulfilling life and had a lot of impact on the world. Not everyone can be Einstein, or even wants to be Einstein, but I think being very good at a few things would make them feel more satisfied with their lives than chasing after many different interests and goals. That&#x27;s just my opinion though.<p>I also disagree with your characterization of Americans. If anything, people in this country are very good at noticing what they are <i>not</i> good at, and live their lives trying to plug those perceived holes, rather than focusing on developing themselves in what they are good at. This is mostly because the consumer culture emphasizes people&#x27;s imperfections in order to sell them products and services. You walk down the magazine isle of a bookstore and are bombarded with messages: you&#x27;re out of shape, you need to be better at sex, you need to learn how to talk to people better, you totally need to check out the latest and hottest JavaScript framework bro! That&#x27;s where the obsession with well-roundedness comes from.<p>Now, here&#x27;s the caveat: people who combine multiple disciplines tend to be very successful. There was a story discussed on HN recently about this where Elon Musk&#x27;s ex-wife pointed that out. I agree with that. But even then, we&#x27;re talking about two or three things at most. Steve Jobs is a good example: he understood technology <i>and</i> design, but he definitely could not be described as &quot;well-rounded.&quot;",1430496846

They&#x27;re just regular people like us, subject to the same prejudices, temptations, motivations, etc. We shouldn&#x27;t be surprised when the motivations that are built into the system actually do something.<p>More concretely, we&#x27;ve vested incredible power with our politicians. That makes them huge targets for those with vested interests (whether those be corporation, special interests, foreign governments, what-have-you). The potential reward to them for getting influence is so great that they&#x27;ll invest tremendously in trying to do so.<p>The idea that &quot;public servants&quot; don&#x27;t magically become saints, but respond to the same incentives as do the rest of us, is the core of public choice economics [1]. There is, in fact, a fair amount of research and literature on the topic from an academic perspective.<p>From where I sit, if you recognize the problem as one where we&#x27;re giving the corporations and special interests, etc., a huge potential payoff by finding ways to co-opt governmental power, then increasing that power to try to combat it doesn&#x27;t make sense: it&#x27;s just increasing the size of their potential payoff. It sounds like silly pop-Zen, but the way to get such corruption out of government is to limit the power of government.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_choice"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_choice</a>",1430496060

7251471,comment,7249717,7250343,3,0,_mulder_,,,"I wonder why long movies are consistently rated higher? \nMy guess would be for two reasons. The first being audience selection. Long films are (IMO) more likely to attract, and retain for the entire length, an audience with a prior interest in the film, and therefore more likely to be an audience who know beforehand if the movie is generally good or not.<p>Secondly, psychology will come into play. The more time an audience invests in a film, the more likely they are to seek a positive reward for their time so they don&#x27;t feel like they have got a bad deal[1]. Thus, they&#x27;re more likely to rate the film higher than it perhaps otherwise would be. I also believe this holds true for &#x27;art house&#x27; films that are difficult to follow and perhaps less enjoyable than a more mainstream film. Audiences will rate them higher to reassure themselves that they haven&#x27;t just wasted 2 hours watching something boring that they don&#x27;t understand.<p>Some links for further reading:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_escalation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_escalation</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-purchase_rationalization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-purchase_rationalization</a>",1392634642

That takes a lot of trial and error; <i>anything</i> that slows down that experimentation process is going to cost you the market.

It&#x27;s mostly a game of luck (getting the good dice rolls).<p><i>Catan</i> is nice, but it does suffer from the same problem, the dice rolls influence way too much of the game.<p>My personal favorites for long games are: <i>The Game of Thrones</i> board game, which is really awesome with the right set of players because it favors a lot diplomacy and strategy (the biggest problem with it is the randomness of the cards, but you can patch the rules to correct that); <i>Eclipse</i>, a 4X strategy game, quite balanced and with interesting rules (the bigger your empire is, the more costly your actions are); <i>Civilization</i> the board game, which is also extremely well balanced (all games I&#x27;ve played have seen cultural, financial, military and technological victories being competitive); and finally, for some good fun with friends, <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> (w/ expansions), which is a classical cooperative board game with traitors (except for a few twists). The tense atmosphere of the TV show is well re-transcribed in the game.<p>For short to averagely long games, my favorites are <i>Agrikola</i>, <i>Race for The Galaxy</i> with the first two expansions (I&#x27;ve probably played hundreds of games of this one at this point), <i>Olympos</i>, <i>Caylus</i>, Power Grid (with slight patches to the rules), <i>Smallworld</i>...<p>If you like games with no chance at all, try <i>Intrigue</i>. It is a game of pure negociation and backstabbing, and you may end up angry with your friends after playing it :-) (which is why it gets very polarized reviews on BGG and equivalents; much like the GoT board game, it is a game where you have to make alliances and betray them in order to win).",1392633422

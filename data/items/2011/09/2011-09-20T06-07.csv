3016587,comment,3013899,3013899,2,0,eLinda,,,"I am pleased and interested by the somewhat heated exchanges going on and especially because of the focus on online education and which technologies do or might support online teaching and learning.<p>Online education is of great interest and importance to me.  I started working in this field in 1983, and have had the opportunity to help shape it, study it, and I continue to contribute to the field.  I come from the education side, and have written some books on this topic.  I have had a company that developed online environments to support learning, and the result was a pretty excellent collaborative learning environment software that 16 years later I still use and which students are pretty positive about. However, my company put our dollars into development rather than marketing, and eventually found that the competition had a crappy product but alot of marketing dollars. So, I wound down the company in 2002. The market was primarily educational institutions, schoolboards, etc and they were buying into the 'lms' solution, where learning is viewed as something to be managed and packaged.<p>Primarily, I am a prof. and I have been teaching online since 1985: I taught one of the very first totally online courses, and it was based on collaborative learning. In fact, online education in the 1980s was almost all about group learning, team project, knowledge building---whether in secondary or tertiary or training education.<p>Phew...long lead it.  But I provide it as a framework to my message which is that: online education can and has served as a major game changer in education, and is likely the key to the 21st century Knowledge Age.<p>I don't see much reference to that in this discussion.
Most of the comments so far seem to be referencing old paradigm ways of teaching and learning...i.e., lms stuff. 
None of the software mentioned has achieved great or even mildly interesting or important learning gains. Mainstream elearning software are mostly associated with groans and frustration and anxiety, not excitement at new ways to teach and learn. Moodle is really a muddle, let's be clear.  Like BB, Moodle was not designed nor developed for learning or teaching.  Education was an add-on to this 1990's moo (aka mud).
Educationally,  Moodle is just a bunch of things added on without rhyme or reason--anything goes, sort of. BB was initially and largely remains an administrative software. This was not about technologies designed to address learning activities but a slap dash kind of commercial ""solution"" (the fact that Moodle is open source does not, imho grant it dispensation or holiness). It is making a mess of online education and undermining and distracting the field.<p>Let's focus on learning, which should and could be really exciting and relevant adventures. About inventing! Innovating! Solving problems! ENgaging in Knowledge communities. Addressing realworld conundra!  Let's talk about learning theory.  WHat learning methods work best? How can we, educators and technology developers) support 21st century pedagogies and discoveries with new technologies?<p>The 21st century is a new paradigm and it is about Knowledge building. Our learning approaches and technologies need to support collaboration and knowledge building.  That vision can help orient us to new ways of learning, to supporting new paradigm learning pedagogies and strategies.<p>Let's stop kicking around the 20th century can of learning strategies primarily based on 19th century factory-needs and models (lecture halls, rows of student desks bolted to the floor, obedience, memorization, repetition, etc.). BB and Mooooooodle take us backward. They waste time, money and talent.<p>Its time to innovate and make a difference, and the world of teachers and learners will thank you for investing your time and energy in designing real solutions.<p>Cheers,
Linda",1316501242

I have absolutely no doubt that Lean works as a model for revealing ""truth"" as Eric Ries claims.<p>Here's the alarming thing that the book suggests: that we are all scientists trying to reveal market insights. Some of us manage to find out that our hypothesis was true and we are rewarded. Some of us disprove a hypothesis, which is a perfectly scientifically admirable thing to do, but we are penalized for it. 100 years from now, will people laugh at how our society was naive enough to let entrepreneurs who fail go personally bankrupt in some cases? Will they even consider revealing market truths to be failure? I'm guessing that 100 years from now we'll have reached a point where these things are true:<p>1. We won't see so many half-baked products get to market (e.g., Blackberry Playbook) because conventional wisdom by then will have prevented those kinds of products from getting as far along in the product development stage as they do now without having fundamental assumptions about them get validated earlier on.<p>2.

Android's open source model is that the code is primarily written and managed by Google, and then released all at once ""when it's ready"". So the only pushes are version releases and related bug-fixes.<p>It was pretty clear that Google never considered Honeycomb to be ""complete"". It was pushed out in a hurry to deal with the fact that manufacturers were pushing out terrible experiences on tablets using older Android versions. Honeycomb is merely a stop-gap to the next version (the upcoming ice-cream sandwich).<p>Google has been resistant to release the source precisely because I think they want to control (as much as possible) the proliferation of that code into devices that it can manage the bug fixing and release constraints on. That's why basically Google partners are the only ones with access to Honeycomb.<p>If the new version is released and the source code isn't, then I think RMS has a point. Ice cream sandwich better be ""complete"" and see a commiserate source-code push to go along with it. If not, Android has lost it's open source credibility. I think it is too early to make that call, however.<p>*disclaimer: I have no inside knowledge or any way to verify that my speculation is accurate:)",1316500523

If all it did was sit there and run, we could regard it as equivalent to a circuit. When we insist that the software in a computing device must be free, we can overlook pre-installed firmware that will never be upgraded, because it makes no difference to the user that it's a program rather than a circuit.<p>Unfortunately, in this case it would be a malicious circuit.

The book is fantastic so far and I haven't been able to put it down. I'm not reading it in a linear fashion but treating it like a reference book. It's literally a tool I've been able to put into action immediately. The book has a level of rigour to it that I really appreciate.<p>For instance, we're all familiar with the concept of runway on Hacker News right? How many of us think it's the amount of time that we have left or money left in the bank? Ries writes this on the subject:<p>""The true measure of runway is how many pivots a startup has left: the number of opportunities it has to make a fundamental change to its business strategy. Measuring runway through the lens of pivots rather than that of time suggests another way to extend that runway: get to each pivot faster.""<p>How many entrepreneurs feel like they're barrelling down the runway and just crossing their fingers that something's going to change? ""Apple will feature my iPhone app and I'll get a thousand users, I can just feel it!"" Or, ""I'm sure we can just get some angel funding, it's a hot market right now.""<p>With Ries' view of the runway, you can literally rely on Pivotal Tracker to show you whether you're extending your runway or shortening it, and that's damn more effective than praying/crossing fingers/refreshing Google Analytics every half hour to see if your product has gone viral, etc.<p>EDIT: The book of course goes into when you should/shouldn't cut costs to extend runway and when you should pivot faster. It also explains what it means to pivot faster (e.g., validate your assumptions more quickly, not necessarily code features faster).

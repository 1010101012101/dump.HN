That&#x27;s valuable.<p>I think a problem we have in the west (I&#x27;m a Brit) is that our generation has inherited a capitalist free market system under the rule of law, but we&#x27;re treating it like a rich kid that doesn&#x27;t value or truly understand our inheritance and doesn&#x27;t manage it responsibly.<p>I don&#x27;t think the situation is as bad as you say. But then my wife is Chinese and I have a good udnerstanding of how bad things can be. When people talk about the erosion of the rule of law and corporatist policies in the west I have a counter-example I can use for comparison and I see a much more nuanced picture in the west. Yes we do need to recalibrate our social contract, particularly in the US, but we do have the institutions and mechanisms available to do that. At least we are capable of having the debate here without getting censored or thrown in jail.",1415019579

8550532,comment,8546023,8549436,0,0,hga,,,"Just a few mostly &quot;I Was There&quot; notes, you&#x27;re headed in the right directions:<p>&quot;Energy&quot; was a prime issue in the &#x27;70s: the &#x27;68-71 ending of the gold window (BTW, prior to that it was illegal for US citizens to own gold) plus the Yom-Kipper War resulted mess up crude oil prices and supplies, and Nixon oversaw a fundamental change in regulatory policy that made everything in this and many other areas a lot more expensive (I highly recommend this book ttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307453693/ which is where I learned about LBJ&#x27;s closing of the gold window, and which actually doesn&#x27;t feature much of Reagan until I presume the end, I&#x27;m still in the Nixon period).<p>And rather critically Nixon&#x27;s wage and price controls were never lifted for oil and gas, and by the Carter Administration bureaucrats were determining where every gallon of refined oil went.  My father actually set up a tank farm of 55 gallon drums, but that turned out to be needless because among other things the bureaucrats made damned sure farming regions were not lacking.<p>The &quot;Energy Crisis&quot; ended practically overnight when Reagan deregulated oil (gas might have come later).  This was mightily helped by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Saudis at least signed on to the campaign to bankrupt the Soviet Union by keeping oil prices down.<p>By the end of the &quot;&#x27;70s&quot; inflation was as I recall flirting with 15% per year, and Volker&#x27;s necessary high interest rate solution brought the prime rate above 20%, and the government had to borrow at ~20% when Reagan came into office, which explains some of what was going on then.<p>On the other hand, Reagan, the Senate Republicans, and Tip O&#x27;Neal, sort of a transitional figure between the older more responsible liberals and the current type, pretty much never seriously cut budgets, instead all the screaming was about decreases from an automatically increasing baseline.  Some of those were of course cuts after inflation, but not by much, as usual, &quot;domestic spending&quot; was the price the Democrats/Left demanded for the Right (which at least here used to include a lot of Democrats) to be able to fight the Cold War.<p>Which of course Reagan won, not that very many people at all believed he would, or could fix our economy.  The mood really was grim back then (there was also all that Malthusian &quot;Limits to Grow&quot; (apparently rified by the energy situation), Soylent Green, we&#x27;re killing the environment and bringing on a new Ice Age, nonsense back then), the first iteration of today&#x27;s &quot;preppers&quot; were the survivalists back then, I was one (starting from 2nd grade in 1968 when my mother became a Civil Defense Block Mother, back before it was decided &quot;Crisis Relocation&quot; was cheaper on paper and CD -> FEMA).<p>The government influence of tax rate cuts was <i>profound</i>.  I went to college far away from my family in 1979, and at a distance watched my parents substantially shift their economic activity.  One extreme of the &quot;&#x27;70s&quot; was their taking out a $50K note to computerize a bunch of doctor&#x27;s offices, and only being able to keep it current, not paying it down, while interest rates were so high.<p>And <i>everything</i> was done with taxation as a primary issue.  As/after the Reagan tax rate cuts were phased in, that became a much smaller issue, and their ventures became much more economically productive.<p>That today we have one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world is significant.<p>Anyway, have fun, and after this thread winds down feel free to email me (it&#x27;s in my Hacker News contact info) if you have any more questions, desire for book recommendations, etc.",1415019262

The salary should also increase in 6 months at a minimum and there should be a clear path to earning a decent salary.<p>We start at around 16-18K and have reviews every 3 months. The goals are set by the employees (we track this using a free product we made called Meta Trails check it out!) and as long as they say they&#x27;ve hit there targets its a 20% raise.

So it is not routinely done: in fact it is only indicated if a patient presents with a MI (gold standard is to have the patient in angio lab within 90 minutes of onset of symptoms, which is great because if they are they can generally reverse the blockages with stenting before long term damage occurs), or if a patient has a positive stress test.<p>CT angiograms are becoming more common but still not commonly used due to decreased sensitivity.<p>If a patient is believed to have risk factors for artery disease then they may be given a exercise stress test- hook up to an ECG, get on a treadmill and if there are changes consistent with vessel ISCHAEMIA (as opposed to infarct), then an angiogram will usually be scheduled.<p>For patients too unwell for a exercise stress test nuclear medicine stress tests can be performed.<p>And finally in patients who have blockages in more than 3 arteries, the gold standard is still (for the time being) coronary artery bypass grafting.<p>I guess to summarise, the reason we can&#x27;t detect it earlier is because generally we require invasive means to do so and invasive tests carry risk to the patient that are hard to justify for screening purposes.\nPerhaps in the future CT angio may be made more readily available, the scanners keep getting better and better and resolution increases all the time however you always want to minimise a persons radiation dose as for every 3-400 people scanned you can cause one instance of cancer...

Google could fight this trend by using SRV records for HTTP/2.  If, otherwise, this trend continues, Google will eventually have nothing in the open web to index, and will therefore get no value from selling ads in their search service.  Therefore, Google is doing itself a disservice by not using SRV records in HTTP/2.<p>I further speculated about the <i>reasons</i> Google might have for acting the way the do – i.e. not supporting SRV records.  I proposed two reasons: First, SRV records do not solve any problem which Google has not already solved for themselves, and they do not want anybody else to simply get the solution for free, since that would devalue their previous investment.  Second, Google assumed that <i>they</i> would be the ones that the Web would centralize into, and even since Facebook has appeared, Google created Google+ and tried to push <i>it</i> as a centralization point, using every pressure point they could muster (YouTube, etc.) to make this happen.  If they could make this happen, they also would not benefit from a more decentralized web as would be enabled by SRV records in HTTP/2.",1415018027

So here&#x27;s some of the symptoms, bearing in mind that they may or may not apply to any given situation.<p><i>Chest Pain</i>\nThe first and most obvious sign is chest pain. It may be radiating down your left side (jaw/arm). It is generally described as a crushing pain. This symptom is less likely to occur for women or people with diabetes. If the chest pain is not relieved by resting (i.e. sitting down), it points towards a heart attack.<p><i>Shortness of Breath</i>\nAs a body attempts to bring more oxygen into the body faster (because your heart isnt perfusing efficiently anymore), breathing will become faster and more shallow.<p><i>Pulse - Rapid, Weak</i>\nYou should take your pulse a few times a year to get a baseline of what it&#x27;s normally like. During a heart attack, it can become faster and weaker. However, this is relative - your pulse may normally be weak. This is why it is important to have a baseline.<p><i>Nausea, Dizzyness, Sweating, Weakness</i>\nThese physical symptoms by themselves are usually not a concern (they happen with many sorts of illness really) but in combination with the above can be a warning sign.<p>In any discussion about heart attacks, it&#x27;s important for you to understand the risk factors: <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/basics/risk-factors/con-20019520"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/b...</a><p>If you&#x27;re high risk and are suffering from the above symptoms, its always advisable to err on the side of caution and call the emergency services.

Unlock door, etc.\n3) Half sitting position. Place your back up against a wall and sit with your knees raised.\n4) Take an aspirin. This will thin your blood and relieve pressure on your heart. \n5) Try control your breathing.\n6) Try not to worry (yeah, I know, this is a hard one).<p>Source: EMT (Emergency Medical Technician) with voluntary ambulance services.",1415017735

Sounds to me like you&#x27;re making baseless assumptions.<p>Great case of the pot calling the kettle black there...<p>No, I do not think that understanding bitcoin applications is as obvious as breathing oxygen. The point is that just because someone didn&#x27;t write about something in one particular article doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t there.<p>> It was just a page full of backhanded jabs and insults towards bitcoin with zero reasoning to support it.<p>A common problem described in that essay, which is not a jab or insult towards Bitcoin, though definitely has the Bitcoin community in its crosshairs, is that the community seemed to take his very real experience with tip4commit as criticism of Bitcoin; your comments are doing a wonderful job of demonstrating the problem.<p>Let&#x27;s go over the &quot;backhanded insults&quot;:<p>* he personally believes that it is a terrible currency [OMG! How insulting that someone has a negative personal belief!]<p>* bitcoin is unregulated [how is this a disputed fact? how is this an insult?]<p>* if you move large sums of bitcoin going in and out of your account you won&#x27;t be questioned by authorities [again, I can&#x27;t see the issue here]<p>* For him, Bitcoin&#x27;s costs and predictability as a means of transferring currency across borders is worse than using transferwise, and even more so when within SEPA. [pretty rooted in fact, no?]<p>The one thing he didn&#x27;t back was his opinion of it as a currency, and the way he presented it, it was quite clear it wasn&#x27;t presented as an argument and he wasn&#x27;t trying to change anyone&#x27;s mind with that statement.<p>In general, I&#x27;d say his essay did a great job of expressing the reasoning behind his actual concerns on this matter.<p>> How is making statements like &quot;bitcoin is a terrible currency&quot; without including any actual reasoning anything but pure ignorance?<p>If he were conducting a debate about the value of bitcoin as a currency, you could make a case that it was pure ignorance. Given that he was expressly trying to avoid that debate, your assertion is ridiculous. He was merely acknowledging his opinion without trying to defend it or make an argument for it.<p>Sometimes you are writing a piece about one topic, but people insist on calling you out on another. You acknowledge your opinion about that topic, but you don&#x27;t want to get in to the details about it because it isn&#x27;t relevant to what you are speaking to, so you don&#x27;t make any effort at all to make a case for the opinion, you don&#x27;t make any effort to defend it, and you certainly don&#x27;t try to persuade anyone to agree with you. (In this case he even qualified it by mentioning some other ways he sees value in the technology.)<p>By example...<p>You&#x27;ve made a number of assertions about all the ways bitcoin is awesome. You also made assertions about Mr. Ronacher&#x27;s knowledge of it, and yet you haven&#x27;t presented any actual reasoning on any of those points. Where are the paragraphs of supporting material on each of the ways Bitcoin is awesome? You haven&#x27;t presented Mr. Ronacher&#x27;s education and browsing history to support claims of his ignorance, or even detailed the &quot;jabs and insults&quot; from the essay!<p>Should we conclude from this that you are contributing nothing but pure ignorance to the discussion?<p>At least to me, that kind of argument seems completely ridiculous.",1415017273

Selective reporting (of publication bias or most other kinds of tests) limits the inferences that can be drawn from the analyses, but it does not necessarily invalidate the properties of the test itself. If my selective reporting indicates that 6 out of 7 articles appear to be biased, it would be improper to infer that 86% of psychology articles are biased. Nevertheless, those 6 articles appear biased whether you make such an inference or not. I think scientists care about the validity of specific data/theory more than about the rate of bias across a field.

While he might negotiate agreements that lead to an improved logistics situation, there are thousands of other people involved in getting Apple products to their destination.<p>But assuming he was, surely you aren't suggesting that Apple's speedy delivery times are the pinnacle of human achievement, and that by their accomplishment of this, that every other human undertaking must be trivial.<p>Writing a Google maps clone is extremely difficult, and if Apple expected to be successful with it already with the meager amount of resources they have put into it, then it was an impossible task and I'd be delighted to tell Tim Cook, that it was in fact, too hard.<p>As it has been mentioned elsewhere, Google has like 7000 people working on maps, while Apple has 13000 people period. It's doubtful that they would have over 60 percent of their workforce plugging away on a maps clone, so clearly they can't expect their program to be better, especially when Google has been doing this for several years already.<p>But my comment wasn't even intended to excuse the state of IOS Maps, I was simply pointing out that while we don't know for sure what happened, there are some possible scenarios where the failure wasn't this guy's fault. I was also pointing out that the statement ""there is no such thing as not my fault"" at the executive level, it a statement that is only true when an executive is given free reign over his work, without anyone else overriding or commandeering.",1351724198

There's no need to retrieve the nonce from the server, the client can generate any random value and include it in the signature. However, one of the beautiful properties of HMACs is that the server you're talking to does not need any stored information other than the shared secret to authenticate the request. That makes HMAC-Authentication feasible over a cluster of servers that share no storage if the secret is fixed. Using a NONCE requires that the servers share a storage that updates pretty much immediately, so they all need access to the same datastore that must have practically no replication delay. Otherwise an attacker could still replay the request, just against a different server.",1351721814

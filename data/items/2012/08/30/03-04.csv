4452837,comment,4452384,4452384,29,0,tomwalsham,,,"Some stream of consciousness thoughts on the history of internet communities, particularly those centred around tech.<p>Usenet had immense value in well defined subgroups prior to the Eternal September (and for some time after, regardless of what people may say).  IRC ha(s|d) similar values, and remains a force within niche communities on the tech side. Slashdot was an early mover in the moderated community space which had to arise from the newfound populist web.<p>I still think /.'s comment moderation was superior to the HN system (pre and post-visible comment scores), but the firehose was too late and too poorly implemented to solve editorial issues.<p>In the middle of this, Kuro5hin rose and fell, metafilter grabbed some component of the serious moderated discussion which it still retains. Fark came and went. Boingboing, SA, b3ta. All significant for a time but not names on people's lips today.<p>HN cannibalised a significant portion of /., but failed to convert the greybeards - the discussion here is noticeably different because of it (and lacking the perspective sometimes).<p>Digg suffered greatly from demagogues (as does HN to an extent), descended too rapidly into linkbait and celebpop trash, and fell to Reddit. The redesign was just the nail in the coffin of an already dead community.<p>Reddit became a very granular experience from its initial tech focus, with a current frontpage of dubious intellectual interest, but their popularity speaks wonders for the ad-hoc community created by diverse interest groups with a common central park. They struggle with discovery for new members, and an apparently descending base age group.<p>Communities come and go. Small herds migrate towards the latest point of interest and some stick. Groupthink is a large driver of community malaise, certainly within the tech discussion arena. Individuals dominate submissions and discussions and evolve to minor demagogue status. Some communities evolve to tackle a smaller arena than just the general topical discussion field, but topicality remains critical.<p>Quora has tackled 'big answers'. StackOverflow 'correct answers'. These are some minor elements of the value of the larger communities, much in the same way that Hipmunk, AirBnb etc have abstracted value away from Craigslist.  Hyperlocal is the next big thing with FrontPorchForum and NextDoor tacking non-technical local discussion.<p>I still view the approaches to these problems as relatively unsolved and ripe for disruption, in particular the algorithms related to subject and comment popularity, user 'karma' (for better or worse), and approachable comment threading when a userbase grows beyond the 'scan a single page' scale. I'm not convinced that a one-size-fits-all approach will ever work, but even within niche tribes there remains a problem with staying 'current' while avoiding alienating the 1-2% who drive much of the discussion.<p>I fully expect a new dominant discussion forum to arise in the tech scene in the next couple of years, but Lobsters seems to be a kneejerk reimplementation of HN that even if it claws some traction would have to evolve rapidly to solve problems rather than dangling the 2013 model of a 2012 carrot.",1346298459

Drop the union idea, the word has too much baggage and becomes a huge people management issue. Turn it into what developers do best, build an app/api.<p>I'm not sure if this idea will make too much sense; I need to see if I can find some time to explore it a little more. I could see building an app/api which is a mixture of a news/issue aggregator and a remote config editor.<p>Figure out how to surface issues to developers in a consistent way. Then let developers decide which issues matter to them, and how to deliver updated configs. Then let developers decide how to use the api/config from there. Maybe some apps will decide to disable in-app purchases for some time period, maybe some will alter code-flows to use a competitor of a big company, maybe some app will praise some company for their stance on some issue. The developers need to be in full control at all times though. The api would let developers read the remote config from their apps.<p>Maybe it just turns into a remote config service, and the activism part gets lost... but it might work as a vehicle for this kind of activism too.",1346298406

In the talk, I missed the point that transaction functions are able to implement ""optimistic CAS"" (which I assume is the same as what is more traditionally but inaccurately called ""optimistic locking""). To clarify, though: Wouldn't precondition testing have to be done /inside/ the transaction, not before, in order to be effective?<p>That's a nice model, I suppose, but doesn't strike me as particularly novel. As has been pointed out elsewhere, the idea that read-only operations can avoid creating a transaction is not particularly important per se. What's more important is avoiding locking, and this is already available in several DBMSes. Indeed, in the sense that reads are consistent ""as of"" a certain point in time, Datomic really does have a notion of a read transaction. I saw in another of your replies here that you consider these to be more flexible than transactions because they are in effect immutable snapshots of the database state, and independent of a single process. I guess for some applications that could be important, but for many applications the process independence is irrelevant (perhaps it helps with scaling a middle tier?), and the eventual storage cost of true immutability will become intractable (although perhaps you'll eventually have ways to release state prior to a point in time). Coordinating different parts of code within a single process over a specific span of time doesn't strike me as any easier with Datomic's model than with traditional transactions.<p>This talk just didn't focus on the kinds of data modeling problems that are important to me and which I consider difficult, which mostly have to do with maintainability of the data model - except, possibly, for the ease of dealing with temporal queries.

One day, a group of members got tired of gibby's (the owner) benign dictatorship and mutinied.  The group started lipstickandcigarettes.com (L&C), which is now a parked domain.  At the time, L&C targeted the same demographic, but was very restrictive on which hipsters could join and had a more savvy GUI than MOC.    It had great early success in attracting members interested in indie rock from MOC.  Eventually, though, the proprietors of L&C lost interest and let the community there dissolve in order to pursue other interests (there were rumors of drug addiction at the time, IIRC).  MOC, on the other hand, is still going strong and presumably making money for gibby.<p>I suppose the moral to my story is this: unless your social network fiefdom actively feeds your pocketbook (as MOC does for gibby and HN does for pg), expect to lose interest in maintaining it once the novelty of protest has worn off.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makeoutclub"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makeoutclub</a>",1346296592

The G4 and G5 had Altivec coprocessing units which were the precursors to SIMD and GPGPU. A few apps could take advantage of it to do video processing and vector calculations but most cross platform apps(like Office or Photoshop) just didn't use it at all, putting the G5 at a severe disadvantage. Also, Intel was, sort of, cheating with their NetBurst architecture. Deeper and deeper pipelines allowed them to get higher clock speeds without adding much actual performance. Ops just sat in the queue longer, but their predictive caching algorithm was very advanced (I'll give them that). Once they got as far as they could go, clock wise, with the P4 they simply started packing more processors on the die (core duo). In fact, their saving grace came from their competitor AMD with the x86_64 extension set.<p>PPC had the ability to go much faster (as seen in the 3GHz X360, PS3) they just couldn't get the die smaller nor the power down. IBM had the performance advantage with their Power7 CPUs but weren't really interested in the consumer CPU market and left Apple holding the bag.

He can't change it, he didn't ask for it, and he certainly showed no interest or indication that he'd like to discuss basketball.<p>That's an outside force impinging on his sense of identity.

So ignore the Y-combinator for the moment.<p>Simply consider the function of a function (of a number) F:<p><pre><code>  F = function (f) {\n   return function(n) {\n    return (n == 0) ? 1 : (n*f(n - 1)); };\n  };\n</code></pre>\nHere the argument f is a function number -> number, and the return value from F is itself also a function number -> number.<p>We can pass whatever functions from numbers to numbers we want to F to make new functions from numbers to numbers.<p>E.g., we could pass in<p><pre><code>  exf1 = function(n) { return n };\n</code></pre>\nand we'd have<p><pre><code>  F(exf1) = function(n) { return (n == 0) ? 1 : (n*(n - 1)) };\n</code></pre>\nOr we could pass in something like<p><pre><code>  exf2 = function(n) { return 1; }\n</code></pre>\nin which case we'd get<p><pre><code>  F(exf2) = function(n) { (n == 0) 1 : n - 1 };\n</code></pre>\nSo now imagine god gives us the factorial function:<p><pre><code>   fact: number -> number \n   fact(n) = n*(n - 1)*...*1\n</code></pre>\nThen if we pass this in to F we get<p><pre><code>   F(fact) = function(n) { return n == 0 ? 1 : n*fact(n - 1) }\n</code></pre>\nBut the above is simply a recursive definition of fact! So F(fact) = fact, i.e., fact is a fixed point of F.<p>Now consider the Y combinator. We know the Y combinator gives us a fixed point of a functional, i.e.,<p><pre><code>  F(Y(F)) = Y(F)\n</code></pre>\n(Note Y(F) is simply a function, even though the argument to Y is a functional, i.e.,<p><pre><code>  Y: functional -> function\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>  Y: (function -> function) -> function\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>  Y: ((number -> number) -> (number -> number)) -> (number -> number))\n</code></pre>\nSo we know that one possible value for Y(F) is fact.<p>The article makes the claim that there is only one fixed point of F, which means Y(f) must actually be fact, but to be honest, I'm not sure why we know there can't be other fixed points of F which Y(F) might give us (though maybe this is obvious and I'm being stupid :).<p>But anyway we can tell by tracing through the definition of Y that it we really do get Y(F) = fact.",1315303826

However, I have a problem with AOL & TechCrunch forming a startup fund.<p>TC has a huge impact on the startup market. They are the most powerful tech news business in the world and can literally move the market on a startup with a single blog post. If it is positive your user numbers sky rocket and the VC's are calling. If it is negative your investors are on the phone asking questions.<p>The CrunchFund gives them skin in the game. TC will determine to a significant extent the value of the CrunchFund portfolio.<p>We read TC because we trust them to give an unbiased view of our startup world. Yes, MG loves Apple and he gets a lot of stick for it. But what if it came out that all of MG's pension money and savings were in Apple stock. It changes things, right?<p>If the journalistic trust between the publication and her readers is lost, TC's influence and readership will dissipate.<p>IMHO the greatest threat to TC is not Arrington leaving. It is the CrunchFund, and the erosion of TCs integrity and credibility that will come with it.",1315303637

2964928,comment,2964543,2964784,5,0,pharrington,,,">Human biology is not that quick to change<p>This implies that biology is why in most cultures men have higher status potential than women. Not only does this ignore lots of horribly obvious things, but in turn implies an understanding of how physiology affects behavior. Besides current science barely having a rough idea of some hormones' areas of effect (eg low testosterone levels having some positive or negative effect on aggression), we can't begin to aggregate how the average minute physical differences between men and women would affect something as high level as behavior. We're still learning the physical effects. Trying to reason beyond that is irrelevant at best. Meanwhile, centuries of oppression and concrete, prescribed gender roles seem alot more insightful.",1315303501

I went out for some drinks with a friend of mine from a long time ago - he is certainly not the sharpest of individuals, but a laugh and good fun in small doses (even if a lot of the jokes include farts :S).<p>For some reason he is also constantly surrounded by very attractive women. I've seen him out and about before and thought ""I'd like to have some of that!"". But my first impression when we were hanging out was that all these girls shared two things in common - good looks and zero intelligence. Most of the fart jokes came from them.<p>Which was a bit of a shock!<p>It took me a while to figure out that most of them weren't actually thick. I managed to have a conversation with one of them later on; and found she was a psychology graduate (one of my favourite pet interests :)), had even published a research paper on her work. Which was just confusing... there was this smart good looking girl, and she was hanging around acting thick.<p>Then I worked it out... they were acting as they were expected to (either by our perception or theirs) on a night out; shove on the lipstick, revert to street talk, laugh at fart jokes and play dumb around the men. The psychologist actually even said this about her career (paraphrasing): ""oh.. well I never really tell people that, it puts them off"".<p>Which is just a fucking sad reflection on society.",1315303300

As a consumer I look objects whose use is clear to me, and prefer to buy from brands with reputations for quality.<p>My Capresso kettle has only one button.  I fill it to two cups, the minimum, boil the water and make my tea.  Now, what if I wanted green tea instead of black?  They say that green tea ought to be brewed at 200°F for best taste.  Do I have <i>less</i> control because it has one button?  No, I have the same amount of control as before: I just have less automation.  So to get my ~200°F I pour the water into my mug, wait 30-60 seconds and add my tea bag.<p>But really, do features sell to all consumers equally well, or just to the inattentive or uneducated?<p>My dishwasher has only 8 settings, 4 of which are the type of wash.  Nothing is unclear in the design.  If I've got a light load I press ""Light"".  If I don't want it to do a heated dry I press ""Heated Dry"" to turn it off.

We're well on our way to critical mass in terms of distribution.<p>Over the next 10 years or so, stereoscopy will fade into the background, in much the same way as stereo or surround sound has - some people will ignore it completely, others will be fanatical about it, but it will be a normal part of the film-making process.<p>We've been here before with sound. Listen to early stereophonic records and you'll hear what we're seeing now with stereoscopy - crudely exaggerated balances designed to show off the technology. ""Revolver"" by The Beatles is a good example - the record is quite uncomfortable to listen to on headphones because tracks are panned hard left or right, creating a completely artificial sound. Classical recordings sounded good in stereo quite quickly because the engineers just stuck two microphones in front of an orchestra, but pop records took a lot of development to sound natural and pleasing, most significantly the development of good stereo reverb.<p>Likewise in stereoscopy, we're currently seeing stereoscopic images with a hugely exaggerated depth effect, partly to show off the technology, partly because the technology and technique still needs to mature. We have films not shot stereoscopically being rendered to 3d, stereoscopic images being digitally 'widened' and all sorts of other shenanigans. There just isn't a body of technique for stereoscopic cinematography, so directors and DPs are struggling to figure it out.<p>I reject the argument that stereoscopy will fail now because it has failed previously. We now have a critical mass of technology that has massively reduced the cost of filming, editing and exhibiting stereoscopic pictures. We have overcome most of the significant technical problems, although this is not evenly distributed yet. This time around, stereoscopy is a big deal precisely because it won't be a big deal for very long.",1283610433

Not being a smart aleck: if someone knows you socially before you begin dating, they should have some general idea of where you stand in that regard.  For some of the ""big"" issues in my own life, I generally find it doesn't work well to get hooked up with people who don't already know some things about me.  But I am not a fan of online dating, so if that is the route you are going, I really can't help you.",1283609513

1662720,comment,1662123,1662687,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Going to reply (against my preferences) here because I'm seeing this repeated. Looks like you are making the mistake several other commenters are: you are ascribing some specific attribute to the word ""God"" and then throwing rocks at it.<p>Are you asking me if a giant squid exists somewhere? Probably not. Unicorns that can sing and dance? Highly unlikely. FSG? I kinda don't think so.<p>But <i>you're</i> the person making up the details. Yes, any detailed explanation of anything that is unknown is more likely false than true. But to say ""therefore unless you proved something exists, it doesn't exist"" is the height of fallacy. Lots of things exist that I (or nobody else) can prove.<p>That's my point: in your eagerness for some kind of ""answer"" you jump too far the other way -- nothing exists unless I can prove it. This is as bad, really, as those who have some large detailed story of a Flying Spaghetti monster that they ""know"" to be true. If you don't know, you don't know. That's it. End of story.<p>Looking back through history, I can say with some degree of confidence that whatever our world-of-knowledge was at any one time, there has always been a bigger world that we were unaware of. Many times a world for which we have no language to describe. Hard to talk about Quantum Dynamics with Francis Bacon. For every pond we swim around in, there is always a bigger pond.<p>This leads me to believe that the unknown is a huge part of our experience. A Great Unknown exists with things in it that will highly interest us and affect our lives. This is just from induction. Not a particular myth that you might find fault with -- the unknown itself. The idea that nothing exists effectively unless we can prove it is a horrible idea. It's really, well, fundamentalism, when you get right down to it.<p>So you can go on arguing octopuses, pink elephants, Thor, whatever. It really has no relevance on what I'm talking about. If you'd like to call the unknown Thor, have at it. Works for me. I like Thor better than ""Bob"". But let's not fight over particulars, because that misses the point entirely.<p>As Hawking put it in another article, there might be a philosopher's God, but he's not somebody that could come down and talk to you. Hawking here still goes off the deep end -- I have no idea if something unknown to me could communicate to me or not. Or -- to put my response to Hawking differently -- can the laws of physics still be valid and things happen for which I have no explanation? Why of course they can. That's just common sense. The opposite belief -- that somehow mankind has a model of reality such that nothing unusual can happen? That's as bad as other folks who think their holy book is a science book. Both groups of people are assuming a certainty that just isn't there.",1283609353

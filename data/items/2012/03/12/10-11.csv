They can be survey questions, interview questions, or constructed situations, to name a few. When constructing interviews and surveys, it is important that the questions directly relate to the research questions. Furthermore, it is important that the surveys and interviews are not extremely time-consuming (ideally within a 20-30 minute limit). If an interpreter will be used, simple questions are always better and easily interpreted questions that avoid ambiguity will lead to more accurate results. Lastly, instead of creating a survey it is better to do research to find out if a similar study has been conducted. If so, previous surveys should be used to yield standardized measures for comparison. Irrespective of the form that these measures take, there are several important design elements that are required to make the study effective.",1331549530

If you have an environment where things are subjected to competition, those government-like institutions will get better. Albeit slowly.

Big chunks of my understanding of physics come from randomly reading stuff on Wikipedia while procrastinating in high school. I discovered HN and learned Lisp when shying away from doing an university project in PHP, which in result got me a job in Erlang and also led to being widely recognized at the university as 'the Lisp guy'. Here I discovered pg's essays and LessWrong, both of which helped me grow, and many other things. I owe much of who I am now to rabbit-holing. And also being a person who always has three solution candidates to any problem in 30 seconds (""you know, there was this startup/library/tool featured on HN last month..."") is a result of that random learning.<p>I do sometimes feel that it's not the optimal way of learning things. I try to find the balance between random-walking and systematized learning, but one thing I'm sure of, it's that the optimum is not on the side of formal education, at least not for me.<p>After trying, again and again, to force and fit myself into 'the System' of traditional, formalized learning I discovered that it is almost impossible for me, and it always have been. Learning what I'm told to learn for sake of tests and exams just repells me, causing almost physical pain. So I'm not trying to force myself anymore, I decided to do what I have to do with minimum effort, and spend the rest of the time learning what I want, the way I want, and allowing myself time for rabbit-holing and procrastinating.",1331548155

It never happened.<p>* The spread of H264 video wasn't slowed down by Mozilla's stance.<p>* Firefox users were effectively forced to install Flash (a far more closed solution) to view videos.<p>* The split in HTML5 video support (Firefox and Opera being the lone holdouts with no H264 support) weakened HTML5 compared to alternatives.<p>* Flash is going away on Mobile devices, which mean that Firefox Mobile users had no way to view videos.

There's several things happening here:<p>1) The founders of Mashable, and their stockholders, are earning out on what they've built. That's a good thing, and well deserved.<p>2) Its really Turner Broadcasting that's doing the buying here. Its an old media company again demonstrating that they are unable, or unwilling, to modernize. They are throwing money at a problem rather than innovating.<p>3) Such a large amount of money flowing from old media into the technology sector works to hasten the demise of companies like CNN/Turner Broadcasting. It drains their coffers a bit more, while providing new cash flow to the founders and employees in Mashable and frees them up to pursue new innovative ventures over the next few years.<p>pg really saw something important when he added RFS 9 - Kill Hollywood to the Request for Startups at Ycombinator.

People will inevitably sometimes choose the wrong way of doing things, end up with underperforming or buggy code and blame you.<p>Especially in synchronization it pays off to go with the simplest solution.

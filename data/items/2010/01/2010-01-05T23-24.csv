We have a certain sales model that is basically ""hit and run"" (We move quickly from client to client with short sales loops instead of detailed and long sales processes, just the nature of the product) so we needed something that matched our model and was finely tuned for how we work.<p>I personally feel like CRMs are just like CMS systems for developers.

I do agree with the overall sentiment:  These days, I find many news stories painful to read, and frustrating when I find the actual facts I'm after in the 17th paragraph and/or scattered throughout in seemingly haphazard fashion -- introduced wherever the over-arching effort in creative writing leaves a bit of suitable room.  Sometimes, something like USA Today is a relief simply because what stories they do run are briefer and written more in the traditional top down structure that tries to put a summary of the most relevant information at the top and then elaborates on it below.<p>Not that USA Today is a substitute for the newspapers of yore.

It is surprising how company after company when you go through their numbers to discover that while they might be all talk about product X they make 90%+ of their money from B.  Discussing how cool X is going to be might have just about nothing to do with how much they earn.",1262733140

It's pretty probable that's more instructions everywhere.<p>And it's not a ""minutely simplified compiler port"". That statement is startlingly naive. Do you have any idea how much hand-coded inline assembly, both in the runtime library and in customer code, needs to be carefully reviewed and modified to port from a platform without this requirement to one with it? Particularly since almost every other platform targeting the same architecture doesn't have the requirement?",1262732891

1033652,comment,1032875,1033533,0,0,michaelneale,,,"He then oddly goes on to talk about the buy vs build argument for things like Oracle/SAP financials/ERP - which are deeply hated by those that use them (granted, may not be able to make that kind of BigCo HR/financial stuff fun !) - but what is interesting is that those systems are not really off the shelf. They are usually multi-million dollar ""implementations"" and sometimes (seriously!) ""re-implementations"" of them - which cost orders of magnitude more then most IT bespoke projects - often due to licencing costs. This makes me think that the numbers make things look better then they are. For example: if the cost of an setup for SAP financials is 2mil, and 400K ""implementation"", then a blow out of 100% in the ""implementation"" cost is not, percentage wise, as big a deal as if it was a bespoke project (ie sans the licence cost) - as the bulk of the cost is a fixed licence.<p>This is also why building (as in skyscraper style) blow outs don't appear as huge - they labour cost is generally a relatively smaller portion of the project cost then the materials compared to IT projects.",1262732772

1033650,comment,1033371,1033628,0,0,barrkel,,,"By results, I meant computational results. The ABI is more a product of what type declarations you have to use to get interoperability on any given platform, and the platform vendor's compiler sets the lead here.<p>For example, the following C statement:<p><pre><code>    printf(""%d\n"", sizeof(long double));

gives the following results on my box:<p><pre><code>    Cygwin gcc:        12
    MSVC:               8
    Embarcadero bcc32: 10

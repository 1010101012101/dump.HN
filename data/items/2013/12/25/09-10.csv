Maybe Chad will show up, he&#x27;s much better at this than me.<p>The problem basically comes down to the fact that Snapchat needs to be able to discriminate between clients that are legit, and clients that are not legit. In other words, at some point Snapchat has to trust that it&#x27;s distributing the server key (or cookie or whatever it uses in the future to allow clients to say &quot;hey, it&#x27;s me, you can trust me&quot;) to a legit client and NOT to a badguy client. This is not possible. Consider this issue taken to the extreme: even if you built Snapchat directly into the OS, and then signed, you could still root the phone and spoof the relevant parts of the OS to make it seem like you&#x27;re a legit client when really you&#x27;re not. Note that even pinning the cert doesn&#x27;t work. You can still get around it by sniffing around the relevant buffers.<p>Spoofing the client basically guarantees that the API can be tricked into providing services that it was designed to avoid providing. For example, you can save all Snaps upon receipt. This is a trivial abuse. There are much graver implications that lead to much graver privacy concerns, but I hope you&#x27;ll understand when I don&#x27;t publicly announce them. :) Though perhaps Chris will tell you about them if you ask nicely.",1387963561

This here. That is evil.<p>But I if under &quot;evil&quot; you understand &quot;defending yourself against attack&quot; then I can understand why you call the US &quot;evil&quot;. However, it is your private meaning of the world &quot;evil&quot;, unknown to the rest of the world.<p>>>> &quot;Depends on the people&quot;, oh my god.<p>Of course it does. One is justified to use violence in defense against attack. I&#x27;m surprised it needs to be explained.<p>>>> By the way the US has already killed far more than 10,000 in response to the WTC attacks.<p>The US killed people in war, it is true. That, unfortunately, the only way to fight wars. If you invent some way to win wars without killing anybody, be sure to tell, it would be most wonderful invention. Until you do that, that&#x27;s the way we have. When attacked, there&#x27;s only two ways to behave - submit to the attacker or fight back.

Everybody thinks their behavior is reasonable - murderers, robbers, rapists, thieves, serial killers - all of them think they&#x27;re very reasonable people in unusual circumstances that make them do those things. There are very few people that say &quot;I&#x27;m evil to do this, but I will still do it&quot;.

Have clients find you more clients, make commissions and eventually earn their money back. Give old clients features developed for new clients. Eventually build out a productized service, get a bank loan, market it and sell the company. Or open source the tech and get a community around it (like symfony, etc)<p>This is the outline of working on your own stuff and just charging clients for high-margin projects, all the while building your technology.",1387962820

And EA canceled &quot;Command & Conquer: Generals 2&quot; as of October 29, 2013.<p>Sadly, beside Star Craft 2 (its SciFi theme is not for everyone) no triple-A RTS games are in active development :(  Back in 2000 there was the last RTS hype and one had troubles to find a new roleplaying game.<p>As more and more players are moving back to PC/notebooks and tablets that all have better navigation interfaces than the bad controllers, I hope RTS games come back :)",1387962563

2730023,comment,2729404,2729404,17,0,ianterrell,,,"1. This is a good discussion to have. Those who are dismissive show, in my opinion, a lack of intellectual curiosity. Elegance for the sake of elegance is a worthwhile goal.<p>2. From a pragmatist point of view, you're right, it doesn't matter. You continue reading and writing PHP and using π. They both get the job done. You don't have to participate any further.<p>3. There will be 2s floating around some equations forever, whether using π or τ. That's not the point. The point is not ""cleanliness"" or even teaching efficacy. The point is elegance and that comes from <i>meaning</i>. What does the equation <i>say?</i> Equation cleanliness and ease of understanding are both worthwhile side effects, but it's <i>meaning</i> that's important.<p>4. Going from π to τ would be nontrivial, and would involve confusion of its own. That makes it not worth it to some people, and that's a valid opinion.<p>5. This article suffers from more selection bias than the Tau Manifesto. The radius is the undisputed king of the circle; it defines it. The area of a circle is not, after all, π * (D/2)^2. But it's not about prettiness, it's about <i>meaning</i>! Area is a property <i>defined by the integral</i>, which has a natural meaning and result with τ. The result may be a little equation that's pretty or not depending on your point of view, but it's just a shortcut.<p>6. The other examples in the article similarly fall apart when <i>meaning</i> is considered.",1309877606

Platform Compass directions. For example:<p>Stations on the Piccadilly Line, from Turnpike Lane to Cockfosters have East- and Westbound platforms.

I'm pretty sure you can take that for granted in any discussion about programming ever unless the person says ""in regards to the exact stack and heap layout"".<p>You don't know the heap layout in C either, at least not without some extreme measures like reading the values of pointers, and you don't usually care.<p>You can't just say ""oh this is sort of like this so we'll just collapse all the differences"".  Macros change your program logically (as in not just perf improvements) prior to compilation.  Not-macros do not.  That's a big difference.<p>That line is crystal clear (as shorthand) to a Java developer because ""foos"" is most likely an Iterator<Foo> which will throw an exception when there are no more foos. In an actual program it will be very explicit that it's an Iterator<Foo>. That's a context thing that's specific to Java where all Iterators behave the same way.  The difference between the standard java.util stuff and macros is that each shop or team has their own macros and in my limited experience with macros, it is not always easy to tell where they're in effect.<p>And, the line isn't boilerplate.  We're creating a reference to a Foo and assigning a value to the destination of that reference.  Presumably, we're going to do some stuff with it later.  Otherwise, yes, we would not be bothering to pop one out of the iterator.  Is that clear now?  What actual point are you trying to prove in this comment?

2729890,comment,2729211,2729397,1,0,brudgers,,,"><i>""instead of filling my memory with facts I store it with pointers to facts""</i><p>[To push the analogy further] Unlike the managed memory model of the Encyclopedia, one of the problems with the internet as memory is that memory addresses are so frequently overwritten and the entire system is essentially non-redundant. This is to say that, unlike books web pages tend to change of disappear after publication breaking links and each web page is - for the vast majority of practical purposes - a unique individual manuscript rather than the product of a printing press.<p>This makes the internet as memory suffer from amnesia as pages are rewritten, overwritten, and discarded in a matter of months even at relatively stable websites and this tendency toward frequent revision encourages a lower level of investment in the depth of data provided on the web. As a case in point, I recently found a genealogical link from 2004 which pointed to the contents of a specific box in an archive in New Jersey that contained a photograph of my great great grandfather while he was serving in Company B of the 95th Ohio Volunteers during the American Civil War. Now the page returns 404, and the search function of the archive website does not hit on my ancestor's name at all - the detailed information which was accessible from the web did not survive the intervening updates of the website.<p>Of course my personal example hardly touches the scale at which the internet suffers from amnesia - even the deletion of Geocities is probably a tiny fraction of the information which the internet forgets at what feels like an ever increasing pace.<p>And given the ephemeral nature of the internet's indices - it doesn't even make sense to talk of remembering a Google or Bing search page given that it is specifically constructed for a unique time, place, and consumer. If the internet is memory, then the search engines are oft-demonic homuncului who provide access.",1309875520

I will note that I've had no problems with the concurrent downloads/installs failing since I bought a Galaxy S II (my previous Nexus One had that problem constantly), but aside from that, I have every problem you described and several more.<p>I have a Xoom as well as the SGS2, and I'd estimate that 70% of the time, the two devices disagree on what apps I've bought. If I buy one on the phone, it never shows up on the Xoom, and vice versa. The web interface is the only one that has a consistent picture of apps I've bought. However, it doesn't always work. On several occasions, I've gotten into situations where an app has an update available, but trying to update just fails silently (and immediately - you see the download indicator flash for maybe a tenth of a second and then it just vanishes). The only way to get past it is to use the web interface to send to a device, which will also fail, and then retry the update from the device. This doesn't always work, but if I repeat it enough times, eventually it will. Usually at least. I have had to, on a couple of occasions, resort to googling for an apk file that I can put in my dropbox account to manually install from the phone -- for apps I got from the Market already. I think I've only had to resort to a web search once. Usually, I can find the apk/odex files on the one device it install on and pull them from there. Isn't it great that I'm considering ""adb pull"" as a victory for installing an app that has a big ""Install"" button right next to it?<p>Some apps show up one day as available in my country (Iceland), and then 15 minutes later they aren't.<p>Sometimes I get notified that updates are available for built-in apps like Maps. Those often fail, and there's no way to get rid of the update notification.<p>In short the Market is a train wreck, and that's not even considering the poor state of discoverability and management.<p>Amazon on the other hand has at least solved the problem of producing software that functions to a minimum standard of fitness of purpose. Their organization doesn't seem much (if any) better than Google's, but at least I know what's going to happen when I click a button on their site. I'm confident that I'm not going to spend the next 20 minutes hunting for an apk file for the app I just bought because the store I bought it from went up in a puff of smoke for no apparent reason.<p>The sad part is that even with all this, I still prefer Android, and I've been a heavy user of both the iPhone and iPad.

Each person owns her friends list, but not her friends’ information. A person has no more right to mass export all of her friends’ private email addresses than she does to mass export all of her friends’ private photo albums.</i><p>> <i>Email is different from social networking because in an email application, each person maintains and owns their own address book, whereas in a social network your friends maintain their information and you just maintain a list of friends. Because of this, we think it makes sense for email applications to export email addresses and for social networks to export friend lists.</i><p>Source: <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/09/googles-response-to-facebooks-response-to-googles-facebook-api-ban/#comment-95565131"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/09/googles-response-to-faceboo...</a><p>So the way they're construing this, contact information is not <i>your</i> data to begin with, but rather <i>someone else's</i> data which you've been granted (perfectly revokable) access to.

Like this guy's - it's a blog post. A blog post should not completely break with JS off.<p>What I think isn't that 'the site breaks with JS off' is inherently terrible. Some sites actually do require JS - but that's far fewer than the number that <i>think</i> that they require JS, and <i>completely breaking</i> with JS off is a very distinct code smell. It says 'this person does not sweat the details.'",1309874424

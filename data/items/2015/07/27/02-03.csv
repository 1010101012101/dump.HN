The host machine encrypts and decrypts using host specific keys so if the file is copied off-server, it is not fully compromised immediately.  This is usually via python script which rewrites the file.  (BTW, pretty easy to do on Windows boxes with MS API).   I&#x27;ve considered using encrypted folders on windows in addition but not sure if that really makes a difference.<p>Usually the base config is in VCS but without user/password/db strings.  We then manually configure the file with the encrypted strings on the server (usually with the machine name in the filename so that we can use hostname in code to find it and makes it clear the file is machine specific).  Not all tools make this easy though and only works if you can add your own code in between.   Also prefer files to environment as the files can be locked down easier in my opinion and more obvious what is going on.<p>I like some of the other solutions that are using encrypted strings but with a keystore server and may consider for the future if they support both windows and linux.",1437964163

This is not real scale-invariance, and many people run a laplacian pyramid of some sort at test time to get it real scale-invariance when eking out the best possible numbers.<p>Rotation-invariance is probably not really a thing you want. The visual world is not, in fact, rotation-invariant, and the &quot;up&quot; direction on Earth-bound, naturally-occurring images has different statistics than the &quot;down&quot; direction, and you&#x27;d like to exploit these. Animal visual systems are not rotation-invariant either; an entertainingly powerful demo of this is &quot;the Thatcher Effect&quot; (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thatcher_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thatcher_effect</a>).<p>Reflection across a vertical axis, on the other hand, often is exploitable, at least in image recognition contexts (as opposed to, say, handwriting recognition). If you look at the features image recognition convnets are learning they are often symmetric around some axis or other, or sometimes come in &quot;pairs&quot; of left-hand/right-hand twins. As far as I know nobody has tried to exploit this architecturally in any way other than just data augmentation, but it&#x27;s a big world out there and people have been trying this stuff for a long time.",1437963998

Any of these CFI type things are taking in risk to try to make stuff fast enough to be adopted on legacy systems. Thanks for the paper as I&#x27;m sure it will come in handy in a future discussion on this stuff.<p>Here&#x27;s a more thorough solution with the kind of performance hit I talk about:<p><a href=""http://www.cis.upenn.edu/acg/papers/pldi09_softbound.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cis.upenn.edu/acg/papers/pldi09_softbound.pdf</a><p>Better than predecessors I read about, though. On hardware side, the SAFE team (crash-safe.org) have enforced several policies simultaneously on their modified processor. Was quite a performance hit but unoptimized and with many protections. Burroughs B5000 (below) had a bit for pointer protection, a bit for code vs data separation, type checks in hardware for procedure calls, array bounds-checking in hardware, and much applied by compiler from HLL to binary. I&#x27;m sure most of that could be implemented with simple hardware on modern processes. Finally, I&#x27;ve seen a taint-checking approach that only took two bits, had under 10% performance hit, and was Linux compatible IIRC. So, there&#x27;s methods with high promise if you ditch the legacy system but people don&#x27;t want to do that...<p><a href=""http://www.smecc.org/The%20Architecture%20%20of%20the%20Burroughs%20B-5000.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smecc.org/The%20Architecture%20%20of%20the%20Burr...</a>",1437962725

I boot to Windows 7 for games.<p>I&#x27;ve had nvidia cards in the past, as well as UT2004 which had a native linux version, and it worked well enough, but performance was still less than half what it was in windows (with the closed-source nvidia driver in linux).

Whatever psychological advantage comes from this pricing strategy is lost in automated currency conversions. We moved prices for the app up and down from 99-cent endings to see what would happen. We saw no correlation between price endings and sales in other currencies. It’s likely that people in other countries have become accustomed to seeing unusual endings on prices as a result of automated currency conversions, especially in app stores, thus removing the common U.S.-based psychological associations with 99 cents.<p>I don&#x27;t see any indication in here that they tested whether US customers had a different response to price endings than international customers do.",1437962510

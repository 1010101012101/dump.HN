They were originally called ""Lets Note"" in japan but rebranded with ""toughbook"" in the US as the business ultralight series.<p>I have a Y4 currently. It is somewhat rugged, but the most important part is that it has every attribute I want: 3.5 lbs, 14"" screen at 1400x1050, built-in DVD/RW, 5-7 hour battery life. The keyboard is quite nice also. Basically, I had a Macbook Air with more features in 2006.<p><a href=""http://rdist.root.org/2008/02/07/panasonic-cf-y4-laptop-disassembly/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rdist.root.org/2008/02/07/panasonic-cf-y4-laptop-disa...</a><p>If you want to replace the hard drive, you have to disassemble the whole thing. RAM upgrades don't require that though. I'm quite familiar with the BIOS and it's one of the better ones. It works fine with Linux and FreeBSD.<p>They stopped making the Y series with the Y7. The replacement (F8 and F9) annoys me a little because they went to widescreen. I hate widescreen. What you want as a programmer is as many vertical rows as possible, not horizontal. The F9 is 1440x900. You gain 40 horizontal pixels but lost 150 vertical! It also has that weird handle thing but you can ignore it.<p>I'm still happy enough with my Y4 that I haven't replaced it. It's such a good combination of build quality and firmware quality that I'm afraid of anything else.",1278950375

The lesson here is not to try to tell your entire story. Just focus on one powerful differentiating idea and drive it into the mind.

2) It’s not a very bright screen, like the iPad.
3) It’s not a blazing fast CPU.
4) It’s limited for video.
5) It will be heavier than most eInk devices.
6) There’s no 3G, it’s WiFi-only.<p>Here's why these matter.<p>1) There is a very good reason no one uses resistive touch for devices intended to be used with your finger. The experience is horrible. You're better off trying to use your fingernail than you are your finger, and that's just awkward.
2) From the photos (and they might just be bad photos) the screen looks find for black & white, but muddy and washed out in color.
3) So responsiveness will suffer when running the full version of Android
4) <i>TILT</i>
5) This hasn't really been a problem for the iPad, but the iPad doesn't suffer from the cumulative negative effects listed here.
6) Not a big problem, IMO. A lot of people bought the WiFi iPad, and for good reason. If you're going to have a 3G data connection, it should probably be in the form of a MiFi or something similar.<p>Here's the biggest problem of all, items one, two, three, four add up to a lousy experience, and experience is everything. Sure, people might buy it once, but they won't use it if the experience sucks, and they won't buy another.

1508162,comment,1505365,1506688,0,0,dan00,,,"""Agreed, thinking isn't words.""<p>But what's the definition of thinking?<p>For me there are two ways of ""thinking"", the conscious one, in which I'm
talking to myself and the unconscious, intuitive one, in which I don't
talk to myself, but get some kind of ""enlightenment"", just see or
understand something without a conscious thought.<p>The unconscious thinking works for me on all stuff I'm good at, stuff I
learned und exercised a lot, so in a way the conscious thinking has been done
before, created some kind of neural connection, and know this connection
is activated without my assistance.<p>For me it's also the case that my logic sometimes works in a unconscious
way, that I just get something, but it's the question how much this
unconscious logic is assisted by former training.<p>A quite long time I only used the unconscious thinking. As long I
advanced, there has been no need for an other way of thinking. But I got
at a barrier, where my unconscious thinking couldn't go further.<p>I think, that If you're confronted with something completely new and
very hard, then the unconscious thinking can go some way, but at some
point it won't get further. You need then to change to the conscious
thinking, create the necessary neural connections, and If that's done,
then you're able to think again in an unconscious way.<p>I think, that you can limit yourself, if you're only used to one way of
thinking<p>Often I'm debbuging in the same way as you. But sometimes it's very inefficient,
when I'm stumble around without a direction.<p>Sometimes it's way more efficient to step back, get the bigger picture,
ask yourself some questions, build assumptions and verify them.<p>Sometimes during the ""conscious"" debugging, when I'm talking to myself
I'm getting an ""enlightenment"", and the bug is solved.",1278948329

Programmers, myself included, can sometimes become so attached to a feature or coding approach that any criticism, warranted or not, becomes a personal attack.  I also think it has become way to acceptable to say ""no"" to customers.  Rather than the constructive reasoning behind saying no, often times arrogance or even self consciousness leads to pretending faults do not exist.  For this reason it is always helpful to have a trusted source for non-programmer feedback.",1278947572

Laptops give you less screen space and less computational power, and in general I've never liked their keyboards. They're also more expensive (I think?) and trickier to self-build. The only advantage I see is portability, which is understandable, but I think it's more that they're becoming the new default computer type for everyone, rather than having people choose between them and desktops.<p>Anyway, mine:<p>I put together the desktop a couple months back: AMD Phenom II X4 @ 3.6GHz, 4GB RAM, and an SSD for the OS and programs. I decided to future-proof myself, after living off that laptop for too long. It's connected to two Acer monitors - one 24-inch, one 23.6-inch, leaving a difference that's enough to irritate me every time I try to align things perfectly. It runs Windows 7 for general use and a virtualised Arch Linux machine for development work. I've tried setting up Windows the way I like it, but when Linux is available I don't think it's worth the effort. The VM does nothing but run Emacs in seamless mode, so everything still works together, and I don't have to worry about window managers.<p>I type in dvorak on a Kinesis Advantage (the black one). I've never had recurring hand problems, but the keyboard setup feels so much nicer to use, I stick with it. That, and a Logitech mouse that I'm ambivalent about.<p>My phone is an HTC Dream (aka the G1), running Cyanogen 2.1. It's been outclassed several times by today's standard of phones, but I'm waiting until it fully breaks down before replacing it. Not sure what with yet, which is a shame, because I like the design, even if the hardware space bar is already starting to go.<p>All in all, I'm happy with what I have.",1278947572

I think it has to do with the blades; occasionally I'll get a cartridge that lasts 6 shaves and leaves me delightfully smooth without a single nick, other times the brand new blade will be like shaving with nettles and I look like a zombie.<p>I sought out my barber, a salty Sicilian who had once given me the best shave of my life with a straight razor.  I joined him for lunch and, while he scarfed down a chicken parm hero, I asked him if I should learn to use a straight razor.<p>""Listen,"" he said in his thick accent, brow furrowing gravely, ""I won't lie to you.  I speak to you now, like you are my own son.""  He mopped marinara sauce off of his lips.<p>""Don't shave with a straight razor.""<p>I blinked.  ""What?

It doesn't matter what razor you use.  The most important thing is shaving every day.  My Mach3 blades last for months at a time.""<p>I felt a little betrayed, but thanked him for his help and duly attempted shaving every day.  It didn't work for me, and my Mach3 cartridges still lasted less than two weeks at very best.  (Sometimes they will be unusable after only one shave!)

- attention to shaving technique tends to be much less with a disposable, possibly due to ignorance
- shaving cream from a can does a bad job of lubricating the face
- disposable razors are poorly designed, with a gap between the razor and the skin, and are easily clogged with cut hair

Surely an unwise decision.<p>The Soviets knew in advance of the invasion of the USSR but Stalin could not believe that the Germany could do such thing. Not because he trusted Hitler, but because such a decision would be stupid - Hitler himself claimed that war on two fronts was unwinnable for Germany since WWI and because he didn't see an adequate preparation for an invasion - sure you have troops near the border, but they were in no way prepared for Russian roads, Russian winter or the Russian distances. There was no way Germany could defeat the USSR before winter sets in with no planning.<p>Stalin planned an invasion of Nazi-controlled Europe, before the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. But the Germans had their invasion a few weeks before the planned. But since the troops and materiel were prepared for an offensive war they could react adequately in the beginning. The Russians had only bombers and a million trained paratroops - this is definitely a preparation for an offensive war.<p>The Germans couldn't achieve any major objective in the USSR anyway:<p>* they didn't destroy the Russian industrial capability: Moscow and Leningrad weren't taken and behind them you have the Volga and Ural areas, which produced materiel and provided manpower which let the USSR win the war and conquer for itself half of Europe. Plus even much of the plants that were in Ukraine and Belarus were evacuated of their skilled workers and expensive machinery and new ones quickly were formed deep behind the lines of combat and the ranges of Wehrmacht air power.<p>* no major resource was lacking in the USSR - certainly not oil, which was one of the critical ones. Germany barely had enough from Romania for its own needs. France, the Balkans, Northern Europe, North Africa were invaded with Soviet provided oil, thanks to the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact.<p>* they didn't isolate Russia politically - they couldn't convince the Japanese to attack them in the back while Soviets had instant allies - Britain and United States which generously provided even more materials and technology.<p>And this was exactly because the war was started by a logical, sane author.<p>Stalin overestimated Hitler, thinking he wouldn't do such a thing.

But I just hate feeling like I'm over-paying...",1278947024

The big one is that the screen can't compare to the 1600x1200 IPS panel of my old T60p. Yes, I did prefer the 4:3 aspect ratio. The audio ports being located on the front is also annoying.<p>Secondary: Mac Pro (borrowed). Two dual-core Xeon 5150s, 5GB memory, headless most of the time. I use this machine to do the heavy lifting for my text classification work. My experimental data set fits in memory on my laptop, but leaves uncomfortably little free space. It also makes my lap warm. The Mac being about 50% faster in practice than my laptop is a nice perk.",1278946959

Lorenz tracked this down to the computer printout. The computer worked with 6-digit precision, but the printout rounded variables off to a 3-digit number, so a value like 0.506127 was printed as 0.506. This difference is tiny and the consensus at the time would have been that it should have had practically no effect. However Lorenz had discovered that small changes in initial conditions produced large changes in the long-term outcome.[43] Lorenz's discovery, which gave its name to Lorenz attractors, showed that even detailed atmospheric modelling cannot in general make long-term weather predictions.

The only thing that matters is the list of programs you like and want to watch.<p>A user would want to see an aggregate of all the programs s/he likes, not go to one app to see what's new on ABC, and another for NBC… that's where the Google TV model is interesting I suppose.<p>I'd think that something more like Google Reader (conceptually, not in terms of UI obviously) might be more fitting: a bunch of feeds for shows you like. You can ""star"" the ones you'll always want to keep around, let others disappear if too old…<p>To be YC-centric, it seems that the recently-launched Teevox got that right by merging listings between Netflix and Hulu.",1282540317

1625924,comment,1625571,1625827,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Depends who you listen to.  There is intense <i>media</i> pressure about making anything other than that your American dream.  That's because the media seeks the largest possible market, so their goal is to find the largest identifiable subgroup of people and then make it even bigger.  If people broke down into subcultures of small groups, they'd never be able to target a demographic efficiently, and they'd be out of business.  Perhaps that's why they're so vitriolic against Google and FaceBook and blogs and anything that empowers people to seek out like-minded folk independently.<p>If you listen to actual <i>people</i>, however, I can almost guarantee you that you'll be able to find someone who shares your quirks.  You might be separated by 3000 miles and have to limit your interactions to the Internet, but there's somebody out there.  If your American dream is to write Battlestar Galactica fanfiction, well, there's a fandom for you.  If it's to play in a garage band at night and live the struggling rock star life, there's a group waiting for you (you might have to move to a city, though).  If it's to work odd jobs during the weekends so you can write the next great American musical, that's possible too (thank you, Jonathan Larson).  Heck, if you want to live in a log cabin in Montana, you can do that too.<p>You can choose your friends, but you generally can't <i>change</i> your friends.  Pick wisely. :-)",1282540158

1625915,comment,1625571,1625821,0,0,rdtsc,,,"The problem is this. If you only get 3 weeks vacation / year, you usually leave 1 for family holidays (extended xmas, thanksgiving week), another for emergencies and  then another 1 week for a traveling vacation with the family. In one week you can't get anywhere too far. You end up spending  2-3 days just traveling if you go half way around the globe. Then you only have 4 days left to actually have a ""vacation"".  It's hard to relax in 3-4 days before having to pack your bags again. So I think people just shove as much stuff as they can into those 4-5 days and they have an ""active"" vacation -- because then it seems to them like they did more, but that often ends up being just as stressful as working (at least to me).<p>> is there some better way to spend a vacation?<p>Another way to do it is to go to a lodge in the mountains for 2 weeks. Hike, relax in a hot tub, read, enjoy some time together with the family, not browsing the web or reading work emails, not rushing anywhere.<p>Another option is the beach. I have no problem laying on the beach listening to the waves for hours. Just give me the time. Sure I like an ""active"" vacation -- but I also like to have the options for a relaxing ""do nothing"" vacation as well.  That is what recharges my batteries at least. The typical American vacation time doesn't allow too much for that.",1282539782

They'll be in similar situation as the author of the app discussed in the article.<p>Problem with monetizing facebook apps is that not even facebook can monetize its users through ads: <a href=""http://valleywag.com/tech/advertising/facebook-consistently-the-worst-performing-site-242234.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://valleywag.com/tech/advertising/facebook-consistently-the-worst-performing-site-242234.php</a><p>Maybe virtual gifts/items will help facebook's bottom line?

If your facebook app does well, then you will pay for it in terms of servers and bandwidth, but where can you make returns? <p>Unless you can somehow draw traffic to your site through your facebook app I think it might be an uphill battle. I heard reports that iLike actually LOST website traffic after the release of their facebook app.<p>You are getting some degree of brand recognition but the user base really isnt yours if they never use your product outside the facebook sandbox. <p>Any thoughts?",1182526243

As an example open www.sun.com and try to imagine what would happen to their front page. ""Sun"" and ""microsystems"" on the logo will be translated too, not to mention that the whole graphical look of the page will be ruined, which won't be welcomed by the owner of the web site.<p>(Not that I care about Sun's web site too much, but this is  an example.)<p>Isn't translating img alt's enough?",1182524600

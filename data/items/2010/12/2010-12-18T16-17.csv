You have an idea, you can make prototypes, you test market the prototype on Kickstarter, the consumer speaks with their wallet, and you can either take it to the mainstream or gracefully exit whilst giving away some ""exclusive"" tchotchkes to the people who paid in.<p>It could also become the manufacturing version of a ""pop-up store"", where potential buyers are given ""exclusive"" timed access to a product before it hits the mainstream outlets. This exudes value (like the Humble Game Bundles or Macheist) while focusing laser-sharp on just one product (a la woot) and is compelling to our baser consumer desires for access, urgency, and exclusivity.<p>Could be an interesting pivot for kickstarter (or perhaps be a nice niche for someone to exploit).",1292691580

2019738,comment,2019433,2019723,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Right now, I am in a bit of a personal computing utopia. I've maxed out the ram of my 2 year old Macbook and installed an SSD. Now, the only wait I have that's longer than 1 second is for network stuff and most things are instant.<p>This gets me wondering: what if we made everything orthogonally persistent in the cloud and used the 200 GB of local storage as a cache? There wouldn't be any notion of a hard disk. Instead, I'd have 200GB of persistent RAM (simulated by about 8GB of dynamic RAM, backed by 200GB of MLC Flash) directly synced with the cloud.<p>I would never have to think about saving anything to disk. I'd just have ""My Apps"" and ""My Data."" They'd just always be there, forever. If I ever lost my laptop, so long as I have network, they'd still be there, just everything would run slower for a few days.
This is a far cry, even from the Cr-48. Such a machine wouldn't even need to boot. [1] Everything would just always be there. (Apps would have to be rewritten to eliminate the notion of the disk.)<p>Clearly, we already have the hardware and software to support this. At this point, it's just a matter of putting it all together. This would take some serious engineering, but whoever succeeded would basically be the next Microsoft.<p>[1] - An easier way to accomplish this would be to maintain a small boot partition, but use the majority of the SSD for 200GB of swap. The kernel would have to be changed so that local swap is treated as a cache for pages stored in the cloud. This prevents us from having to engineer error correction directly in RAM. This would only be a stopgap, however, as eliminating the notion of a hard disk entirely would have significant benefits.",1292691545

2019714,comment,2019665,2019665,0,0,danieldk,,,"On underpay: this varies highly by country. I am a PhD candidate in The Netherlands, and am employed by the university for four years (as most PhD candidates here). This gives around modal income, a 13th month of salary, holiday allowance, and about two months of holidays per year.<p>This is a bit less than one would earn going into business immediately, but it buys you a lot of freedom. The education/research split is 0.2/0.8 FTE. There are specific goals with respect to the research project, but other than that there is plenty of time to pursue your interests.<p>Our university tried to implement a scholarship/bursary system, which was not welcomed by potential Dutch PhD candidates. Foreign candidates do not seem to mind as much, since such scholarships are common in other countries. In my opinion, the scholarship system was a bad move, since pursuing a PhD becomes less attractive to the best of students, due to higher wages in the industry. In the end the scholarship system was shot down by the court (they see a PhD as a normal employment), and seems to have vanished for the time being.<p>Conclusion: you get what you pay for. Higher PhD candidate wages equals less PhDs, but more high-quality PhDs. With lower wages or scholarships universities can have more PhD candidates, but you will probably lose out on talent who'd rather go to the industry, and the PhD population has a miserable life (low income, long working hours).",1292690786

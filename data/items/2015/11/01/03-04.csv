Yellow jackets are wasps, fundamentally different from honey bees.<p>The behavior of honey bees is one driven moreso by an inherited willingness to engage in servitude, than with wasps. Wasps are predatory carnivores, and their nests are smaller, more distributed, and constructed out of found materials, modified and pasted together. Wasps don&#x27;t construct nests of secreted wax, they use mud and chewed up wood. Most wasps don&#x27;t make any honey.<p>In honey bee hives, the manner of reproduction and sex selection is different. The queen really is the window through which the genome passes, and her capacity to produce devoted offspring, hopelessly obedient to her brand of pheremones, is her mark of success as an organism. And if she produced peers and not subjects she&#x27;d never have the spare time or the environment in which to gestate her offspring.",1446350352

I never assumed the companies they would contact would be entirely financially based, I think the idea is that if someone can figure this out the should essentially be vetted (after a good in-person meeting) as a good candidate for almost any project you want to throw at them.<p>To me, the stock-market aspect of this seems entirely because it&#x27;s a large, complex, distributed system that&#x27;s not entirely theoretical (i.e. has been real-world tested), can be modeled accurately enough in the game, and is complex enough to provide for some real challenging problems.

The same cannot be said for the Hurd, which for the first few years was literally <i>one</i> guy (Thomas Bushnell) writing everything from scratch based on the stock CMU Mach 3.0 he was only getting acquainted with (he was much more familiar with 4.4BSD instead), and that the GNU project spent about 3 years procuring due to its proprietary licensing. Further, the MINIX 3 people later imported NetBSD, again heading on from that.<p>b) I ran GitStats on MINIX 3 and got a lifetime contributor count of 70, with around 13 major developers.

In fact I&#x27;ve often considered this question in the context of teaching physics - wouldn&#x27;t it be wonderful if you started with a really hard problem, flailed around for a while, and then learned the thing that could solve it for you? Instead (in basic mechanics) we get &quot;f=ma&quot; and then see how it applies to a bunch of systems, instead of first looking at some idealized systems and challenging a student to ask some really basic questions about it. (Not necessarily the full equations of motion, which might not make sense yet, but basic stuff like &quot;how fast does this weight need to move before it leaves contact with this curved surface&quot;).<p>(Actually, it&#x27;s a little more involved with &quot;F=ma&quot; because really that&#x27;s a key to a bunch of other keys - it yields closed form solutions to a bunch of important problems which are characterized by whether &quot;a&quot; is constant (linear motion), proportional to x (a spring), proportional to x^2 (gravity, electrostatics), their rotational analogues, and so on.

In Sinatra they&#x27;re combined, it takes a lot of hackery to implement Rails-style routes. But you&#x27;re gonna need them more and more as your web app increases in complexity.<p>Rails takes everything involved in web applications, breaks it apart, and figures out how to best implement it, then writes a nice guide to help you navigate the convention. If you learn how Rails does it, you&#x27;re pretty much learning how to &#x27;best&#x27; do it. So you can, for sure, re-implement it in Sinatra, but why? Rails already has a one-liner that will do exactly what you wanted it to do.<p>Generators is another big win. Once you learn how that system works, and granted, right now it&#x27;s really hairy and not nice at all, but when you wrap your head around it, you can really turbocharge your webdev workflow, giving you Lisp-like superpowers without having to suffer the pain of debugging your own tools.<p>The sheer amount of knowledge embedded into StackOverflow is another huge plus.

Futures, options, shorting etc?  Derivatives can play a very important role in the financial system.  They can also be abused.<p>Futures allow farmers (or airlines, or anyone else dependent on commodity prices) to hedge the chances of a bad harvest (or increased fuel prices) by locking in rates early.  It&#x27;s a form of insurance.<p>Options, (let&#x27;s go with calls and puts) were initially seen as purely speculative, but combined with an actual position in the underlying security allow someone to make investments while minimizing their overall risk.  Again they act as insurance by people who know how to use them.  Morons can make naked calls or puts but the generally lose their shirt.<p>Shorting stocks plays a very important role in the financial world.  Investors that short a company are one of the few entities that have a genuine interest in uncovering the dirt in a company.  Regulators, share holders, etc may want to believe that a company like Enron is really doing well, but short sellers have a burning interest in combing through every line of their financial statement.<p>While CMO&#x27;s got a bad name in 2008 they are still used today as a relatively high yield alternative to US Treasuries and other fixed income investments since the Fed has decided to keep interest rates near zero for the last 6 years.<p>CDO&#x27;s also got a bad rap in 2008, but when used correctly they allow the transfer of risk from one party to another.  Kind of like a cosigner on a loan.  (gross over simplification, but good enough).  If you&#x27;re AIG and you don&#x27;t actually have the money to backup all the CDO&#x27;s your writing, then trouble can ensue.<p>Interest Rate swaps are probably what jacked up your dollar number in that article.  They are the vast majority of derivative investments, but they allow companies with variable rate loans to hedge agains the risk of a rate hike, by swapping with a company that has higher, but fixed rate obligations.  Those can be a very big win for both parties.<p>Financial derivatives get a bad rap because they sound scary and most people don&#x27;t know what they are.

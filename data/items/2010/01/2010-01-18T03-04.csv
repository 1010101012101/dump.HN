For example, since essentially all private elite universities in the United States systematically discriminate on the basis of race, for a given ""quality"" of applicant, minority applicants are likely to have a more prestigious degree.  This tends to concentrate the top-of-the-field scholars MIT wants to attract at a very, small set of institutions, since if you move just a little down the institutional prestige scale you'll find schools happily admitting minority students who are not cut out for careers at world-class research institutions.<p>This is difficult to verify because universities lie pervasively about their systematic racial discrimination, but when data does come to light about them, for example in the Gratz v Bollinger litigation, it typically shows that the discrimination is less a ""plus factor"" and more ""two institutions at different academic tiers which happen to be geographically co-located"".

If I understand the other thread correctly, Google even notes for the user's benefit that some search results have been removed when it complies with legal directives such as that used in Australia. Google gets to decide how to do its business of generating search result pages, including how it wants to respond to the laws of other countries. Google isn't censoring the site linked here.<p>P.S.

Can people still get to the offending content? Certainly. Do more people know about it now than could have ever possibly known about it previously? Yes.<p>My point is that no matter how tightly the Conroys of this world try to clamp down, there will always be cracks that are exploited.

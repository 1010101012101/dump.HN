Just got the link, took over 3 hours and its an almost 100MB zip file (compare that to the ~50kb of actual data that I was interested in exporting).<p>The actual stuff has none of the stuff that I would actually want to export (my friends email addresses and phone numbers are not included), the photos aren't the originals that I uploaded (which I would actually like since I lost some of the higher resolution copies) and absolutely nothing is in a format that would be useful for using the data in <i>another website</i>. That is the entire point of data liberation; this is just allowing you to store facebook so you can view it without an internet connection. That is not at all what Google's data liberation or Yahoo!s export features do; they actually give you the information you want in a format that would allow you to use it with one of their <i>competitors</i>.<p>I hope that this post didn't sound too negative, Facebook is really a quality website in general and it's probably a great place to work, but the export feature is pretty clearly intentionally set up in a way that would make it impossible to use in any meaningful way. It is only very marginally different than doing a file > save page as in your browser. It's actually the perfect example of how opposed Facebook is to what Google is pushing when it talks about data liberation.",1309820352

Sure, coding to the interface makes scaling easier, it also makes maintenance, testing and everything else easier: it's just a good idea.  But the devil is in the details.

How is this different from how music, books, games etc. are produced now?<p>Currently, if someone violates your trust, by releasing their own version of a song you wrote, for example, you can sue them. It's not clear to me that this would be the case in a copyright-free world. You would have to explicitly have to make a contract with everyone who ever comes in contact with your work before it's ready. That would be tiresome, at best.<p>And it doesn't cover people who steal/stumble across pieces of it in progress. There is no way I would not be working on something before it was paid for. Before I even put an idea up for funding, I would have notes and such. If someone takes these and makes a derivative work, I get to prosecute them for... stealing paper, because I'm not allowed to claim the information content of the paper as my own.<p>Artists not skilled in secrecy are going to be in serious trouble.<p>> Not sure if you got me. No publisher required. Its direct b2c. Just like kickstarter.com works today. I'm only missing the ""big fish""<p>No, I didn't quite understand that model. So if there is any large-scale physical production, say printing books or burning CD's, that will be handled by third parties and the artist won't have anything to do with it? And people who want the physical form will have to pay two parties?<p>One problem you'll run into is that everyone benefits equally no matter how much they put in, including those who didn't put anything in. That sorta sucks for anyone who put in a lot, who then watch those who didn't help at all benefit from their money.  You're essentially relying on charity, and that's a worrisome business model.<p>I wonder if the reliance on idealism would have a positive effect on the quality of work produced.<p>I need to think about this more.

I would come home from school and there would be something hanging on my bedroom door and the question was not ""does it fit?"" it was ""do you like it?""  She still routinely buys clothes for some relatives without taking them with her.  I do this kind of thing for my sons as well. My sister routinely bought clothes off the rack for ten years without necessarily bothering to try them on (I think this changed after she had a baby).  When my sons were little, my mother sewed a lot of their clothes and mailed it to us.  I occasionally took their measurements and let her know the updated measurements.  She can buy you a winter coat for Christmas one year, mail it to you in another state and not see it again and buy gloves the following Christmas that are a perfect match in color (I don't have such amazing perfect color memory -- and the woman is blind in one eye).<p>I tend to give clothes short shrift, because it's not a big deal for me.

I have to settle for a 12GB/mo. plan for about the same price as my Blackberry's plan. It's now the first month I've had my netbook, and after bringing all my offsite files in locally, I'm stuck using public WiFi for the rest of the month since I already used up my 12GB, + $250 for an additional 4GB.<p>The only problem I've had with Sprint so far is that the netbook's WiFi didn't work out of the box, and I couldn't use it to do my big offsite backup's download. I eventually got the corrupted apps reinstalled & afterward contacted Sprint support to try to get a credit on my overage charge, but they would only credit a third of it citing that I should have waited until it was resolved before finishing my big download project.",1328410620

Holding the cards is worthless when you don't know you're playing a game, much less that you have a winning hand already.<p>That's why most ""startup guys and girls"" work and scrimp and suffer and sleep under their desks for a minority share in nothing, while VCs (the business types) laugh all the way to the bank.<p>Because taking outside capital is like forking over your hand of cards AND promising to only play tiddlywinks in the future.<p>Whoever holds the money, holds the power. Unless the other party wakes up to realize that they don't need the money.<p>The fact is that for the past decade (and getting better all the time), it costs virtually nothing to start a profitable web-based business. Almost no one truly needs the money men at all. Tech types still think they do, though. They want the security & validation & <i>ease</i> of being handed a great big whack of cash. Which means they end up the person without power.<p>The amazing thing about developers, designers, teachers & writers is that we not only own the means of production, we carry them with us IN OUR HEADS.

It may be a response to prevalence, I'm not going to take that away, but there is also the factor that we perceive the same prevalence differently.<p>I grew up near the Vermont/Canada border, the first time I went up there to drink I was 14 and we were raging it hard in some Quebecois' basement.  I went upstairs to take a leak and almost shit a brick because unbeknownst to me, their parents were chilling upstairs watching TV and were fine with the fact we were getting wasted and hooking up in the basement.  One of the girls that had gone up to cananda with me was puking her guts out in the basement bathroom and refusing to speak anything but broken French and they were completely fine with this.  All the Quebecois' parents knew they were off getting trashed and were fine with it too, hell the mother of the family me and pukey mcgee were staying with us bought us our booze.  A few years later I had a handful of friends at my place in the states and we had a few shots in the attic over newyears.  My parents found and were pissed, my, and everyone that was there's, parents yelled at us quite a bit.<p>So we might have more abuse here, but we certainly define abuse differently.",1328409566

She gets herself up and dressed in the morning and off to the buss top (too far to walk to school). We do things together, but it's not our job to entertain her. She finds her own entertainment, and often that means playing with other kids in the neighborhood - fine, so long as she's home by dinner. She knows if she's late she misses dinner and if that she misbehaves at someone's house, then that privileged of being able to come and go with the other kids in the neighborhood is gone.<p>She has daily and weekly chores that she's expected to do. She doesn't get an allowance for that - it's just a normal part of contributing to the family duties, and if she wants something, she does extra chores to earn the money.<p>She's a great kid, never have had a behavior problem out of her. I think part of the reason for that is in addition to just giving her a whole bunch of love, we also respect her and hold her to a standard that we know she's capable of.<p>That's very much how I was raised, and I have a great relationship with my dad and a lot of respect for him.

You aren't initially doing freelance work and then starting a company, rather you are starting a company as soon as you start doing client work.  The mind-set is important because you will be more successful from the start.<p>You absolutely need to know JS well, and be proficient in HTML / CSS, so I'm not sure a focus on either front-end or back-end is good advice.  However, with limited time you need to choose your battles well, so don't worry about mastering HTML / CSS at the start (ie, you can duplicate any site but you won't be as fast at it as someone who does this part as a regular gig.)  Become proficient with Linux, but don't spend too much time there.  Just learn the basics, the rest can quickly become a sand trap and your time is best spent elsewhere.<p>To make this work, you need six months living expenses at the start of doing client work.  Three months is an absolute minimum and once you hit that point you are in critical territory.  This is extremely important because this determines how you are able to plan and pick your jobs.  Drop below the three month point and you are taking a hit in your job selection and rates because you are forced to take whatever comes along as opposed to having a buffer period where you can work out better gigs.  This then places you in a vicious circle because not being able to select the right gigs might make getting your savings back up to six months difficult.  Freelancing can be very lucrative to those who are well established in development circles, but at the beginning you will be hard pressed to even be able to pay your basic expenses.<p>You mentioned you are a traveler.  Get out of San Francisco and move somewhere cheaper while you are just getting started.   San Francisco is probably great for looking for start-ups to work for as a full timer, but you can do freelancing from anywhere.  You can move back at a later time.<p>You might consider PHP because there are more things that you can do in the market with it due to easier hosting options and the large number of PHP content management systems available.  If you were to learn a CMS such as Wordpress, Drupal or ExpressionEngine well then you could easily be landing your first clients within 3 - 6 months.  CMS work is mostly configuration and converting static HTML / CSS into dynamic templates.  You could focus on learning the CMS (pick just one to start) well for 2 - 3 months while also learning JS / CSS / HTML.  After that, you can start looking for clients and move into PHP so that you can extend the platform.<p>CMS work in PHP may not sound as good as building custom applications in Python and it probably doesn't pay as well on average, but you are on a limited time frame.  If you were already an A level developer in Python, then I would have different advice.  You can always learn Python down the road a bit and eventually make a switch.  One caveat on pay is that marketing / sales skills are ultimately more important for your rates than your programming language selection.  I have seen great developers do horrible on the business side and I have seen developers with little skill raking in the cash.  The business side is a totally different can of worms and will make you or break you.<p>Spending time learning is important but spending time building a portfolio isn't so important.  A portfolio is necessary for designers, but developers just need to know their stuff.  Building for friends and charities is good for learning, but it's not very helpful for your bottom line.  Instead, you might focus on building small niche ideas of your own which you might be able to monetize.  If nothing else, you could try selling the sites you build on Flippa.  Another option (especially if you go the PHP route) is to build add-ons for content management systems and sell them on your site.  Working for free should be limited to contributions to open source projects.<p>Always keep an open mind for alternative business models and plans.  If you are a skilled marketer, you could even get started right away by bringing in work and then outsourcing that work to other developers.  You could do some world travel and live very cheap by moving abroad to a place like S.E. Asia while you are getting started (that's what I did.)<p>Lastly, you might consider attempting to get started with a web development shop after your learning period.  This will give you a chance to see how a good shop should be run while you continue to build your development chops.<p>I have been thinking about building out a service to help people get started in freelance web development.  I will send you an email.",1328408623

This means that six months after the change was introduced roughly one quarter subscribers will be removed.<p>Why would AT&T do this? To avoid the negative publicity associated with eliminating a plan so many people valued while maximizing profitability. This was quite cleverly executed: Offer cheaper limited plans to save customers money, which has the effect of offering new customers a more competitive price while existing customers will happily pay the higher price as insurance against potential overage fees. Then, by removing the highest data users, they could maximize revenue from them while continuing to collect the higher fees from the lower data users. Then once unlimited becomes a less attractive offer than the $25 plan, eliminate it to avoid revenue leakage. The strategy might not be optimal but its superior to the simpler alternatives in the short run.<p>Of course, the reason is works is that the majority of customers are sufficiently credulous to purchase an implicit insurance contract that AT&T never had to honor. Their actions are legally defensible since the customers did receive the uncertainty reduction in the present period but most of them likely knew they wouldn't go over and paid only for the option of maintaining that protection in a future period.

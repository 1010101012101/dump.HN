5374028,comment,5373807,5373807,3,0,ripperdoc,,,"This is a nice idea, and I love IFTTT, but it doesn't substitute Google Reader for most people. First, as pointed out, it is setup on a per RSS-feed basis. But still, take 50 or 100 feeds and you'll very quickly have a problem over too much information to handle. Google Readers deals with this well, but if you pile it into Pocket, it will be difficult to sort and track your reading, and your normal Pocket saves will be buried below mounds of RSS-articles that you may or may not want to read.<p>To me, the beauty of Google Reader (and iOS apps like Reeder) is the ability to sift through a lot of incoming information and DEAL with it, e.g. send it to Pocket, Pinboard, Evernote, etc. I'd actually wish Google Reader was even MORE optimized for dealing with large and quick information flows (such as - why can't I feed it Twitter feeds, or any page with/without RSS?). And the reader should do some pre-filtering or guesses on wheter the articles is of interest to me or not.",1363255153

Quite soon you'll have a population of 200,000, and the traffic is quite a lot worse, but not terribly bad.<p>The real horror comes when you start a region's great work. A significant number of people will leave the city in the mornings to work at the great work. If you are making a great work you are probably sending dozens of trucks with resources to it as well. The end result is you get easily 10x more vehicles leaving/entering the city. The queue to get in through the single lane off-ramp from the highway then ends up stretching all the way to the next city, and it takes a good 24 hours for the cars at the end to get in. It then ends up stabilizing, taking maybe 4-6 hours for someone to get into the city.<p>Also, a large number of cars 'just passing through' will use your city entrance as a 'quick' way to do a U-turn on the highway, blocking traffic even more.",1363255039

That's right. And it's a pitty. But, most of the time, I would not pay parsonally most of the pages I visit with my money, and the fact that the creator of the content gets paid by a Ad company thanks to an arrangement that have done is something I don't care.

And I agree you shouldn&#x27;t underestimate your potential. People who&#x27;ve done great things tend to seem as if they were a race apart. And most biographies only exaggerate this illusion, partly due to the worshipful attitude biographers inevitably sink into, and partly because, knowing how the story ends, they can&#x27;t help streamlining the plot till it seems like the subject&#x27;s life was a matter of destiny, the mere unfolding of some innate genius. In fact I suspect if you had the sixteen year old Shakespeare or Einstein in school with you, they&#x27;d seem impressive, but not totally unlike your other friends.<p>&quot;Which is an uncomfortable thought. If they were just like us, then they had to work very hard to do what they did. And that&#x27;s one reason we like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for being lazy. If these guys were able to do what they did only because of some magic Shakespeareness or Einsteinness, then it&#x27;s not our fault if we can&#x27;t do something as good.<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not saying there&#x27;s no such thing as genius. But if you&#x27;re trying to choose between two theories and one gives you an excuse for being lazy, the other one is probably right.&quot;<p>We are NOT sure, on the basis of research, what anyone&#x27;s upper limit of ability is. We have no idea about the extent of the &quot;reaction range&quot; constrained by the shuffle of genes a person obtains before a person is born, but we are absolutely sure that the reaction range is a RANGE, exquisitely sensitive to environmental influences. The discordance of identical twins for all human behavioral characteristics amply proves that. So, yes, let&#x27;s say determination can matter as much or more than inborn ability. There are ample examples of that in today&#x27;s world.<p>EDIT AFTER SEEING stiff&#x27;s COMMENT AT THIS LEVEL:<p>Yes, many children bail out of further study of mathematics because they assume school lessons should be easy, and so they think &quot;they have no talent&quot; for subjects that become hard.

So dominant in fact, that it led to a spec tire.<p>Adrian Newey designs in the past ran on the ragged edge of fragility in order to make the cars as fast as possible.

~$400B in non-healthcare-related welfare spending, like food stamps and unemployment benefits.<p>You could maybe squeeze out another couple hundred billion from reducing aid to states and other programs made redundant by the new payments.<p>But the next nearly two trillion is really hard. Eliminating the entire defense budget wouldn&#x27;t get you even a trillion. Doing the equivalent of lifting the Social Security tax cap and adding a marginal 12% to high-earner income would only net you another $125B.<p>If you were serious, you&#x27;d need to either double income taxes, most of which would come from the middle class, or impose a VAT or sales tax around 20% that would raise the equivalent (which would hit the middle class and the poor).

Then develop and install two custom services - one obtains the required information, e.g. the trading data, from the internet or sends data to the internet. The other service runs on the disconnected computer and communicates with the software actually using and producing the data, probably in the form of a proxy server.<p>Finally connect both computers using something simple like a null modem cable and make both service communicate over this link using a very simple proprietary protocol. Assuming the disconnected computer is not already compromised before you start using the system and you have not been extremely sloppy when you designed and implemented the two services, it should be quite hard to compromise the disconnected computer.<p>One way would be to find valid data (passing the protocol checker in the receiving service) to be transferred from the connected to the disconnected computer that triggers a bug in any data consuming software leading to code injection and execution which in turn sends secret data over the null modem link to the (compromised) connected computer. That seems to be a quite a complex attack to me, especially if the data traveling over the link is something simple like stock price time series which enables very simple protocols and thorough validation.<p>To avoid some classes of bugs, e.g. buffer overflows, in the services linking both computers I would implement them using a managed runtime like .NET.

Any library not provided by the compiler we wrote simply because purchasing libraries was very expensive. We also weren&#x27;t afraid to code a solution specific to the problem and not be overly concerned with abstracting every library for potential use with any future application. Most work went into the server code, which housed the application logic and coordinated with the database; graphic UI&#x27;s were a luxury.<p>Nowadays a web application, for example, is tiered more. Different frameworks are encouraged for the different tiers: Bootstrap, Spring, Hibernate, etc. Each one is its own ecosystem and is built on top of other libraries. It&#x27;s very common to make web service calls outside your WAN. Quickly you find out that &quot;standards&quot; have different interpretations by different library authors.<p>UI&#x27;s are no longer an afterthought. They affect how successful your application is. (My observation is that a well-designed UI can cut down on user errors and training by two thirds over a merely functional UI.)<p>I&#x27;m keeping the example simple by not mentioning necessary middle-tier components that we didn&#x27;t use 20+ years ago. We also didn&#x27;t worry about clustered environments, asynchronicity, or concurrency.<p>Not knowing the application you needed or how the analysis was done by the coding team, it&#x27;s hard to say if some of their &quot;slowness&quot; was getting to know the problem AND coming to understand how extensible, performant, and reliable you wanted it. My own approach is usually to solve the &quot;happy path&quot; first and then start surrounding it with &quot;what if&#x27;s&quot; - e.g. what if a null is passed into the function, etc. Over time I refactor and build in reliability and extensibility. The coding team you referred to may have used a different approach in which they tried abstracting use-cases and building an error handling model before solving the &quot;happy path&quot;.<p>Your &quot;tl;dr&quot; is spot on.

These days, flash provides a filled framebuffer for the browser, and the browser composits it with the page in software or hardware.<p>The step back to the model that the proprietary blob draws directly on screen will turn out to be non usable for most web properties (like netflix, youtube, amazon, bbc, vimeo etc.) because they all place custom branding, advertising, user annotations, closed captions, player controls and other navigational/informational elements on top of the content.<p>> Say we do draw a line and convince the W3C to drop EME  who benefits other than Adobe and Microsoft? Apple doesn&#x27;t need EME because they&#x27;re selling billions of dollars of movies through the iTunes store. Google will put EME or the equivalent into Chrome for anything they can&#x27;t sell through their store.<p>Microsoft has been one of the staunchest and most feeverish proponents of DRM. Initially launched by Google and Netflix, to a mounting opposition from the EFF, Cory Doctorow, me and many, many other people, Microsoft stepped in and agressively stiffled dissent in the discussion on the standards body and held almost daily telephone conferences with netflix to push EME trough as fast as possible.<p>The reason Microsoft is all hot&bothered about EME is because for the first time, in a long time, they see a credible chance to lock the web back into only their own platform (and certain tollerated proprietary small-bit players).<p>The question isn&#x27;t who is going to benefit if you oppose EME. The question is who is going to benefit even more if you don&#x27;t oppose it (which is Microsoft).<p>So the argument &quot;Oh Apple and Microsoft are just gonna profit off EME&quot; is moot, they&#x27;re gonna pull their vendor-lock in and non-standard web fraud anyway, but now they get to say &quot;waaaat? we&#x27;re not evil! see, it&#x27;s a standard!!!&quot;<p>> This places Firefox in a really unpleasant situation: Mozilla will either be forced to license something, hope something changes before the plugin vendors drop out, or lose market-share because users are more likely to switch to IE / Safari / Chrome if something doesn&#x27;t work in Firefox rather than not pay for DRMed content.<p>As I&#x27;ve said before, Firefox is in more than an unpleasant situation, because either EME is totally crippled and unusable for everybody, or the CDM will only be available to proprietary browsers. Either way, Mozilla/Firefox loses. But allowing EME/CDM/DRM is the worse choice, because it attaches all the legal headaches of DRM with a standard bodies blessing.",1381501922

However, the marginal income tax rate would have to be <i>huge</i> (as you need to recover the entire amount paid to the earner in &quot;basic income&quot; before you get a cent to spend on someone else), the consumption taxes would negate the value of the basic income, and punitive corporation taxes would just ensure no-one actually sets up a company there.<p>Until we have Star Trek style technology for these free ham sandwiches, I don&#x27;t see how Star Trek style economics will actually work.",1381500492

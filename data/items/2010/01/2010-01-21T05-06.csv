1066725,comment,1066572,1066572,0,0,kowen,,,"Taubes' take on the caloric balance equation (thermodynamic law) is fascinating.<p><i>Change in energy stores = Energy intake – Energy expenditure</i><p>According to my biochemistry professor in college, this had one - and only one - interpretation: The change in energy stores is controlled by energy intake and energy expenditure. The right side of the equation controls the left side of the equation. Also, there was an implied ""just eat less and exercise more"" (that energy intake and expenditure are independent variables).<p>But Taubes suggests that the causation could be reversed, and that energy intake and expenditure are dependent variables. In other words, a metabolic change could cause a change in energy stores, and energy intake and expenditure would change to match.<p>That (amazingly!) translates to: if you are losing weight you are likely to be less hungry and likely to have more energy. Or perhaps, if your metabolic state is such that you are losing weight, your hunger will adjust to match your activity level. Or even, if you're burning fat, you will only eat to make up for what you aren't getting from stored fuel.<p>It makes sense to think that if your energy stores are releasing fuel into the blood stream you would be less hungry (I'm assuming that hunger signals are a function of available fuel to some extent).<p>Naturally, we eat for nutrition as well as fuel, so I suppose it can't all be broken into thermodynamics, but it's an interesting way of thinking about it!",1264053333

1066704,comment,1066271,1066271,0,0,onoj,,,"I live in china. I have lived here for 11 years. I am western. I have friends who are in Shanghai and Beijing they are fully Chinese and either own companies or are judges or (sometimes) criminals. At no time and in now way have these people been shy about criticizing the government or swearing at the traffic jams created by state visits etc. At no time have I seen or experienced censorship. In many drunken evenings or in business meetings any and all topics are discussed openly. There are rules however, yes, the government needs to be involved in things. Yes it can act in unusual ways - for example banning online games. (seemingly because one high level official did not like the amount of time their son was spending on WoW.) Yes minorities are persecuted and yes they shoot criminals. It's is a long way from perfect. But... 1.3 billion people. There are 12 cities in china with a pop of more than 5 million (in the city local area) . These cities have highly complex local governments which do not always follow the central government. China is a lot less one country than it seems and it is certainly not policed or controlled with any obvious force.
In many ways it is also free. Sometime more free than other places.. this may sound weird but Hong Kong is again the freest place to do business in the World. It is many regions, many languages and cultures. As in the US, the government is distinct from the people. And the government has a hard job keeping it together. The only thing I agree with in the article is that going the Russian way would be bad for China. As for Google... as always the real story is probably much different from the one told by either side. But i am more inclined to believe it is something silly rather than serious.",1264052122

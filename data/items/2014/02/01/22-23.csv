If public communication isn&#x27;t your thing, how hard is it to find someone to proofread your message when you&#x27;re working at a corporation? In either case he&#x27;s not the person Adobe should have handling a PR situation.<p>>  I think a lot of time is wasted on perfecting spelling/grammar because of comments like the one above.<p>I&#x27;m very sympathetic to an engineer or scientist having issues like this, perhaps working in fields where people from all over the world will be working together. On the other hand, if you&#x27;re working in customer care, <i>written and verbal communication is your thing.</i> If you&#x27;re not good at it, that reflects on you and your company and the seriousness with which they take the customer care function.<p>Poor communication started the problems here with this customer so it is an especially touchy subject for Adobe. Hence the way people are reacting.<p>edit: wow, mhurron, why not interact with what people have actually written in its full and intended context instead of assuming the worst about people and knocking over a strawman?",1391294132

Pen and paper almost always works better than any one of the gazillions of TODO applications out there. And I&#x27;ve been always wondering why. (Apart from programming TODO items that live in the source code itself, of course).<p>When you want to say something to a colleague at work, you have a choice of emailing/IMing or just saying it out loud (if you can speak of course) as in, you know, normal human conversation. You don&#x27;t use a text editor and a speech synthesizer to say something out loud, do you? Because the effort isn&#x27;t worth it, obviously. Just like you choose an email app that helps you get things done with the least effort, you can as well chose between app vs. non-app.<p>The thing with the TODO list is that there seems to be this stereotype that you need to keep it in digital form. This has obvious advantages of being copyable, searchable and potentially accessible from anywhere if it&#x27;s cloud-based. But in return, you compromise simplicity of use. Find the app - click - find the &quot;add&quot; button - click - think of the deadline - launch the calendar - click - click - click ... - type the text - click &quot;OK&quot; - close the app. Now compare that to: turn your head (or your chair) some 30-45 degrees - grab the pen - find the bottom of your list - think of the deadline - write. Fast, simple and sweet, isn&#x27;t it?<p>So sweet in fact, that I can sacrifice searchability (easier to skim through the list on paper if it&#x27;s not too long) and universal accessibility (rarely need outside of the office).<p>Or maybe I&#x27;m just being old-school?",1391293967

A scientist does some experiments and writes up a paper. He sends it to a journal who sends it out to two or three peer reviewers. They peer review it, which means writing a page of comments on it, and recommending either accepting or rejecting it. Usually you get a few journal rejections and the average time-lag between finishing the paper and its being published is 12 months. Then the paper is behind a paywall and people have to pay $35 to read it.<p>Our view of scientific publishing is that when you finish the paper you should post it immediately on the internet. Peer review should be done post-publication, and it should be done by the community, reddit-style, not by just two or three people. We believe peer review will be more robust that way. And the paper should be openly and freely accessible for anyone to read, along with the data and any accompanying materials like source code.<p>We believe that this will speed up science, and accelerate research into curing diseases, reducing infant mortality, and discovering clean energy amongst other things.<p>We are a mission-driven team based in San Francisco. We have raised $17 million from Khosla ventures and Spark Capital. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes &quot;We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world.&quot; Over 7 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 800k plus join up each month.<p>If you are a mission-driven person then you may enjoy the atmosphere at Academia.edu and the problems we are working on.<p>We are looking to hire full stack software engineers.

Without pressing for financial info, can we ask: Does this translate into a full-time paying job, cover the expenses of running the project, or simply add a bit of pocket change here and there? Why did you choose this business model?<p>KoL&#x27;s donation revenue is currently sufficient to support a full-time staff and a second team working on a new game. I feel like we were extremely fortunate to have launched when we did and to have gotten the critical mass in the beginning that makes it possible for this to be a career instead of just a hobby.<p>As far as choosing the business model, I&#x27;m not sure there was ever a moment when I made a choice about it. A couple of months in, the hosting bills were starting to cost more than I was comfortable paying out of pocket, so I put up a link to ask for donations to offset the cost. A player suggested, &quot;Hey, why don&#x27;t you give donators an in-game reward?&quot; and I figured &quot;Hey, why not, it couldn&#x27;t hurt.&quot; To my surprise and delight, it was pretty much instantly profitable. I was still processing the donations by hand for quite a while -- the revenue model was really kind of an afterthought.<p>After it got to the point where I was able to comfortably and safely quit my day job (and finally start paying Josh, who had been diligently working for free for several months), I started offering the monthly specials, which caused another surge in income and allowed me to hire an office manager, another writer/designer, and another programmer.

I think your advocacy veers a little towards being willfully obtuse. I would say there has never been a single game that has been made more fun or interesting by the &quot;wait a few hours or pay money to continue&quot; mechanic. Resource and time management is certainly a valid mechanic but that assumes that the player can continue doing other things (as in actual &quot;gameplay&quot;) while the time-intensive operation is happening. Even failing that, if we assume there is some game that is fun to not-play while you sit there waiting, the fact that you can pay money to advance invalidates it as a gameplay mechanic. At that point it can be nothing but a business decision.<p>On the coffee shop example, you are paying for the intrinsic value of the coffee, so no, other offerings should not affect you.

Light pressure is incredibly weak:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light#Light_pressure"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light#Light_pressure</a><p>The formula is F = P/c so 1 watt of power (say, from a laser) only results in a force of 3.33 nano newtons or 0.75 nano pounds.  In other words 1 kW (a little over 1 horsepower) results in about 1 micro newton or 1 micro pound of force.  A craft that used light pressure for propulsion would use up most of its mass (even with fusion or antimatter fuel) to get to some fraction of the speed of light.<p>So if this effect is real and has a performance higher than 3.33 nano newtons per watt, to me it&#x27;s one of the greatest breakthroughs in the history of propulsion.

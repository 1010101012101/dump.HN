Sure, you can take your idea and work it with another team --- but your prospective team can take their ability to execute and work it on another idea.<p>Moreover, in many <i>many</i> companies, the key idea that enables the business comes long after the team starts on the first idea; maybe it's a pivot, maybe it's a refinement, but either way, the core intellectual kernel that ""makes"" the business isn't predictable. When it comes, most teams don't suddenly grant the person who generated it another 3% of the company.<p>It's destructive to suggest that, in the common case, an idea is worth multiple percentage points. Just zero that line out in your calculator. You can't calculate the uncommon cases, so what's useful is a shared understanding of what ""usual"" is.<p>Personally --- again, this is just me --- if you all start at the same time, and you all quit your jobs, and you all get the same kind of income (steady salary, quarterly distro, nothing, &c), you split the thing up evenly. Not even worth discussing. 33/33/33 and vest.",1327183184

They are a completely unethical company that uses slave labor.<p>I can imagine what the US Apple-apology brigade would have been saying about efforts to ban slavery in the United States: ""we can't afford to pay more for cotton! if we have to pay people to make our goods instead of using force to make them slaves, why we might not be able to buy as much stuff"".<p>Admit it there is NO excuse for supporting this stuff other than you value your electronic gadgets more than workers and the environment in other countries.

There needs to be an import BAN on products created with slave labor and/or destructive environmental practices, period.  We need to start outlaw this practice, and start prosecuting executives who outsource their production to countries where workers are slaves and the environment is being trashed.  We are the biggest market by FAR and taking this step would be tantamount to the British Empire's banning of slavery during its heyday.<p>Instead of a race to the bottom, this step would start a race to the top. Companies that want to sell products into the world's largest consumer market would need to produce products ethically, otherwise they'd forfeit a HUGE amount of sales.

Send regular spam but have the links take them to an anti-spam education page, something short that they would remember.<p>Like, ""If this were a real spam you would now be prompted to buy X so that we can steal your identity and sell you fake products that could kill you. Good thing it isn't!"" ",1194301453

Basically testing
a) Networks basic
b) Intimate C knowledge
d) Basic algorithm knowledge<p>I would prefer some more questions, and some questions had answers that were not exactly wrong.
1. UDP is preferred over TCP for VoIP mainly because:<p>Well that is a pretty simple answer, but it's answers kind of confuse that issue.  UDP is preferred because there is less overhead, and you do not spend any time trying to handle lost packets.  I guess the main piece is that you ignore lost packets since they have to arrive in a timely manner or are useless, it will not help you to re-request one piece of data, because the by the time you get it the second time it is useless!  <p>Ah well...fun diversion and it never hurts to remember random topics you haven't looked at in a while :)",1194301090

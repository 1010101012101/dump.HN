M247 seems excellent if the allow websites such as mine, but their dedicated servers are a bit pricey (I pay €14 to Kimsufi/OVH for a 2TB HDD dedi with 4GB RAM, Intel Atom CPU and unmetered bandwidth. ) and a VPS might be too slow for this. I don&#x27;t know. I would need start up money to buy servers, and I&#x27;m new to this (15 years old) so I don&#x27;t know.

Imagine that country is under occupation by an oppressive regime and you have no voice, no rights, no freedom whatsoever.
Imagine that every day your family, friends and those you know are living under threat of imprisonment or death.
In addition to that imagine that you are at a time when the state of medicine hasn&#x27;t advanced beyond blood letting and cupping as the most advanced techniques to fight disease.<p>Now stop and think. Other than the medicine part there are various parts of the world where this scenario is the daily truth.<p>Granted you feel poor and need to struggle through everyday life.<p>Can I ask you a few questions
1. Can you see, hear, smell and speak?
2. Do you have the use of all your limbs?
3. Can you afford a daily meal?
4. Do you have some decent shelter?
5. Do you have access to healthcare?
6. Do you have access to basic facilities such as clean running water and toilets?<p>I think if you can answer yes to most of those questions, you are probably not a 1 percenter, but you may be better off than 30% to 40% of the world&#x27;s population.<p>You have every right to bemoan your fate but it&#x27;s all relative.<p>There&#x27;s always someone in worse shape than you.<p>Thank your respective deity if you are so inclined that you are not in worse shape than you are in.

The Netherlands is okay for some websites (file hosting) but bad for other similar sites (file sharing).

So that might pose a risk to you in the future.<p>I would be amazed if Adsense didn&#x27;t suspend your account when you get popular. Once they do so, your biggest challange will be finding a way to generate revenue for your website. File hosts/sharing sites all use low paying ad networks, that&#x27;s why you see installer adware mixed with popunders and a dozen ad banners on those sites. I recommend using two ad networks at a time so if one suspends you, you&#x27;ll not be drained of funds. Video ads are the highest paying when you&#x27;re unable to use adsense. AOL&#x27;s Be-On network is fantastic (you can earn the same amount as Adsense with that network).",1428266543

While I like his work and agree that he has had far-reaching influence on today&#x27;s world, his <i>architecture</i> is not something most people are familiar with outside of the Pattern Language fanboyism that sprouted– which he himself has denounced (ref. Notes On the Synthesis of Form, 2nd ed. preface). Where we seem to disagree is that modern architecture, to the best of my observation as an architect and traveler, has far exceeded niche interest. Rather, it has been so influential that the real niche is those who actively fight it. Note that this is not the same group as those who ignore modernism (vernacular builders, non-design architects, and others). Among those who presume <i>design</i> to be the foremost issue in architecture, the influence of modernism is still quite strong. Even among my non-design-interested peers, &quot;sexy&quot; is always somewhere between Bauhaus and California Modern. (Though I secretly suspect that they&#x27;d be the ones bringing the postmodernism, maybe a fancy glass house bachelor pad with <i>marble Corinthian columns</i> at the head of the bed or something crazy like that.)<p>I also don&#x27;t think that the laziness you describe is limited to modern architecture. Plenty of modern movements have hinged on the idea that earlier styles were lazy recapitulations of <i>styles</i> which to varying degrees were meant to cost less and look either familiar (popular) or expensive. They may be right, but then they are stretched thin by a long line of enthusiastic practitioners eager to make a name themselves. That&#x27;s nothing unique to architecture, and as broad as my interests are there are plenty of structures from the classical to the contemporary that range fall over the map in terms of intrigue and beauty.<p>That&#x27;s as far as I can stretch my attention for now.

There might well be reasonable limits beyond which the maximizing of habitat space and energy consumption tapers off in utility. Even if our civilization continues on its present course, it&#x27;s not certain that we will get to the point where we (or some of us) feel the need to change the face of the galaxy. If you go one step down from the galactic stage, the detectability of solar system-scale megatech is also open to debate, especially as you move beyond a couple hundred light years from here.<p>You&#x27;re right of course when you say all it takes is one civilization (or even one member of a sufficiently advanced society) to undertake projects that are liable to make all kinds of strange phenomena appear in our night sky. But the number if beings capable of doing so on a whim, multiplied by the chance they&#x27;d be interested in such things, might be very very small without breaking any of our current expectations about biology and physics.<p>Finally, I&#x27;d like to address the simulation argument. There are two extreme ends of the simulation scenario spectrum.<p>At the one extreme, we&#x27;re talking about an artificial reality made especially for us, humans. This would be the popular &quot;Matrix&quot;-style simulation. No scientific argument I&#x27;ve heard so far makes it a convincing model for the reality we live in, <i>except</i> as a possible explanation for the Fermi paradox.<p>At the other end of the spectrum, we have a full simulated universe. It&#x27;s hard to argue for or against that notion, simply because either way it fits with our observable reality. The catch is of course that it&#x27;s a neutral proposition with no impact on us at all. This variant does not offer <i>any</i> explanation for the Fermi paradox.<p>As I see it, the simulation argument as pertinent to the Fermi problem offers two options, neither of which are intellectually appealing: one is a borderline-untenable just-so make-believe world where all rules are an illusion and anything can happen, and the other one is virtually undistinguishable from our &quot;normal&quot; world, up to and including an absence of any obvious explanation for the Fermi paradox.",1428266041

     resources in syntax (brackets).

     Some people might argue that getting a value from an array is totally 
     different from getting the same value from a function or a map, and
     deserves special syntax. If we look at languages which did away with 
     this made-up difference we see that pretty much no person is missing 
     it.

     Even if you disagree with this reasoning and consider arrays to be 
     something very special, deserving its own syntax – guess what? Rust 
     developers introduced the traits Index and IndexMut, so all the great 
     ideas about some type being special and knowing what happens when you 
     read [] went straight out of the window.

     If we dig deeper and try to understand why they did something so 
     astoundingly mis-designed, we basically hit an interesting issue:

       They overloaded their [] operator to do two completely different 
       things, depending on whether there is an & in front.
       Thing A: return the value at the given index
       Thing B: return an address pointing into the indexed data

     This of course doesn&#x27;t translate well into the () syntax, given that 
     Rust devs are proud that they don&#x27;t support overloading.
     (I guess []&#x27;s overloading doesn&#x27;t count for some reason ... and doing 
     the little dance with traits doesn&#x27;t count either.)

     Taking a step back, if it would have been considered acceptable to 
     pick two different names for doing two different things, the whole
     issue wouldn&#x27;t exist, e. g.:

       Thing A: values(1)
       Thing B: values.at(1)

  2) Yes, we agree. Having different sets of rules for a) language 
     designers and b) language users has shown consistent results:
     It never worked out.

  3) Yes. I have nothing against terse syntax, it should just be 
     consistent. (I favor not abbreviating things though, because it&#x27;s
     difficult to be both terse and consistent, considering that things 
     can be abbreviated in more than one way.)

  4) Yes, I know what they do. I just thought it was a nice example of two
     related constructs having different casing style and abbreviation 
     style.

  6/7) See 1). The sad thing is that [] can do whatever the developer 
     wants. All guarantees went out of the window with Index/IndexMut.

  9) What I meant was that not every macro wants to define some weird 
     language DSL. There are plenty of things which only exist as macros
     because the language lacks varargs. (vec! for instance.)
     If the language ever adds varargs, vec! can&#x27;t just stop being a macro, 
     because that would break source compatibility: They would need to keep 
     the macro version of vec and introduce a new non-macro version of vec,
     and hope people migrate from vec! to the &quot;new&quot; vec.

     It&#x27;s a design which makes the common 90% suffer for the benefit of the 
     most complex 10%. Sometimes it is worth it, but in this case I think it is
     not.

 10) I had the combination of picking a symbol which is both hard to read and
     hard to parse in mind.

     Every language that chose <> has weird cruft and therefore it shouldn&#x27;t 
     haven been too surprising that Rust is also suffering issues, but in 
     Rust&#x27;s case the problems have been shokingly severe. There are loooong 
     discussions about it if you want to read them. (So it&#x27;s not just me.)

 11) Sorry, I meant structs.

 12) URLs are an option. There are also alternatives. I think the essence is
     that it&#x27;s possible to deal with these issues without entering Java&#x27;s
     tld.mycompany.mycontinent.mygroup.myproject.mydogsmiddlename madness.

One of the things we found was that wear-and-tear on the system was almost negligible -- probably less than 10% of what you would see in a human-driven vehicle. This was partially due to the fact that it was driving on a smoother surface than an ordinary roadway -- but also due to the extremely conservative and consistent acceleration/braking behaviour which the vehicles achieved, which put much less stress on many parts of the system. Although those are essentially hand-built prototype vehicles, I expect them to last ~400,000 miles before requiring significant refurbishment.<p>Based on these observations,I feel quite comfortable predicting a dramatic decline in the rate of vehicle sales within the next several decades.",1428264840

But the more Ruby I write, the more typing looks like Linus from Charlie Brown&#x27;s blanket.<p>Because you don&#x27;t need a monolithic code base any more. You can break it up into smaller pieces that interact with each other using POD objects.<p>When I start to have type problems in Ruby, I start looking around for a domain concept that I need to extract into a gem. The codebase never grows to a point to where it becomes a serious problem.",1429531189

Most of us have had some rough patches(nervous breakdowns, gaps in employment, addiction issues) and usually have some family member that helps out. These people had no one to turn to.&quot;</i><p>This. I&#x27;ve spoken to many homeless people - mostly in NYC but in other cities too. Whenever I ask about their family they always tell me that their folks woudn&#x27;t pick them up. I once called the son of a drunk middle aged man on Brighton Beach. He didn&#x27;t seem too particularly concerned when I told him I knew where his dad was.<p>I want to make a website where people can see profiles of homeless people, hear their story and sponsor them. I would have a very low cost operation: rooms in cities for homeless people, with a shower, computer, and food (soup etc). Homeless could use the room but would need to register their name, photo, biometrics (fingerprint etc) and progress through a program that would be a bit gamified. The steps would be somewhat personalized but essentially include the following tasks:<p>Register\nGo make an appointment with a psychiatrist\nGo meet someone who will help buy clothes, shower etc.\nGet a cellphone and an address\nTalk to a career counselor\nApply for government assistance, with help\nGet an education or a job<p>They would receive cards and we&#x27;d see what they spend on. Their cards would be loaded with more money as they complete challenges. They&#x27;d be self motivated with 90% assistance from the program. I am a big believer in &quot;smart tools&quot; that make motivation easier and take care of 95% if all the research and logistics. The homeless person shouldn&#x27;t have to figure out what they need in their backpack, what programs exist in their city and how to apply or take advantage of them. This hould be done by experts. And motivation should be optimized also, with human servie providers helping do evaluations and customizing.<p>I also believe in metrics and reporting, which the public funding the website would receive as people get off the street get a job and their stories of success.",1429530396

The inner section would need to be marked (as in a multi-part section), and https response headers would need to indicate which byte range of the body should be read as-is and decoded with key deckey.<p>Again, I am hoping for some sort of extension to https to make it cache friendly.<p>Advantages: File is encrypted once (or as needed if policy requires it) and caching proxies can serve the file without re-encryption per user session response.<p>Disadvantage: Likely need to change http/s in some way to wrap and mark plain data.",1429530020

I have no doubt that if google really wanted to, they could roll out the same kind of specialized mining hardware and dominate the blockchain, they just have no reason to.  Consider, specialized hardware can get up to 1,000 MHash/s/$, which means an investment of $1000 would get you 1,000,000 MHash/s.<p>Now let&#x27;s look at google&#x27;s datacenter expenditure.  They spent something like $11 billion of datacenter expenses in 2014, and even considering that part of that is non-server related expenses(real estate and building infrastructure), let&#x27;s see what happens when we punch $5 billion into hashing hardware.  I get a value of around 5,000 PetaHashes/s, which would absolutely swamp the network, as it&#x27;s only sitting at 35PH/s.  Also, consider that that&#x27;s just their expenditure for 1 year, not the total they&#x27;ve put into their datacenters.<p>In conclusion, comparing cpus capable of general purpose computation to specialized hardware that can only do one thing is useless.

For instance in the first semester of the first year, there is a course that explains theoretical stuffs that are supposed to have a relation with hardware (like 2-adic numbers [1]). The project for this course consists in programming a watch that displays time. But we have to program the watch in an assembly language that we have designed ourselves. And that asm has to execute on a processor that we have designed ourselves. And we have to write the processor code in a hardware/netlist language that we have to design ourselves. And we have to write ourselves the interpreter we will use for that netlist language.<p>That was what we were told to do, with no additional instructions. Some students learned C by themselves for that, some other C++, some other OCaml… And all of them learned or reinvented how to design memories, or a CPU (for instance, me and a friend decided to invent a single-instruction processor, just for the fun, we got it working but it was rather slow compared to other who decided for instance to learn how to implement a simplified MIPS).<p>All this to say that there is absolutely no incompatibility between having professors and teaching (partly) by projects.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_number"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_number</a>",1429528603

We incurred net losses of $50.3\n    million in our fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, $112.6\n    million in our fiscal year ended January 31, 2013, and\n    $168.6 million in our fiscal year ended January 31, 2014.\n    As of January 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of\n    $361.2 million. These losses and accumulated deficit\n    reflect the substantial investments we made to acquire new\n    customers and develop our services. We intend to continue\n    scaling our business to increase our number of users and\n    paying organizations and to meet the increasingly complex\n    needs of our customers. We have invested, and expect to\n    continue to invest, in our sales and marketing\n    organizations to sell our services around the world and in\n    our development organization to deliver additional features\n    and capabilities of our cloud services to address our\n    customers’ evolving needs. We also expect to continue to\n    make significant investments in our datacenter\n    infrastructure and in our professional service organization\n    as we focus on customer success. As a result of our\n    continuing investments to scale our business in each of\n    these areas, we do not expect to be profitable for the\n    foreseeable future. Furthermore, to the extent we are\n    successful in increasing our customer base, we will also\n    incur increased losses due to upfront costs associated with\n    acquiring new customers, particularly as a result of the\n    limited free trial version of our service and the nature of \n    subscription revenue, which is generally recognized ratably\n    over the term of the subscription period, which is\n    typically one year, although we also offer our services for\n    terms ranging between one month to three years or more. We\n    cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability in the\n    future or that, if we do become profitable, we will sustain\n    profitability.\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1372612/000119312514112417/d642425ds1.htm#toc642425_2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1372612/0001193125141...</a>",1429528036

Other districts will likely lack some or most of that, at some or most levels, and will have to compensate some other way.",1429528007

And in this sense scientific data is very sensitive - it matters that you know your data is the correct data.<p>2. As so many do, it vastly exaggerates the performance costs of HTTPS. They are really minimal. If you really care I suggest you benchmark before you make any claims regarding your servers can&#x27;t handle it.",1429527973

9407221,comment,9406789,9406789,0,0,TickleSteve,,,"Interesting. I was going to write a similar article myself, tho showing how C++ can be more efficient for even 8 and 16 bit processors than even C.<p>The combination of templates, an optimising compiler that inlines code nicely and avoiding virtual functions means you end up with extremely efficient code while still allowing nice abstractions where necessary.<p>Part of the trick is to also avoid dynamic code as much as possible; it is critical in embedded systems to avoid including any code that is wasted in a single-application system. This means no dynamic-memory allocation, statically allocate everything and use templates for drivers so addresses can be inlined straight into the code allowing the compiler to remove any overhead.\nDoing this means, startup time (and importantly, wake-up-from-deep-sleep time) is minimised all the while allowing for nicely decoupled code through the use of C++.",1429527849

See the response to the comments (also explains why rsync is not appropriate in their system for a specific class of file).<p>jhourcle is not against https, but he/she wants the ability to use http where an exception is needed. The cost of the certificate is negligible, but the ability to keep a fragmented, heterogeneous (age wise) environment is part and parcel of the job, and NO additional funding is being provided to accomplish or operate this under https.<p>From reading the original and the response to other comments, it is apparent to <i>me</i> that jhourcle has thought this through and is only asking for an exception process that they can file for. Just as they do today for systems that are not in compliance (not related to https) for various reasons (ref: comment response).",1429527842

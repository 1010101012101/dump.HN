As with social sites (Digg, Reddit, HN), the chemistry of the community and the influence of the admins can have a powerful effect on the quality of the content. It also depends on what you're looking for. If all you want is cheesy enchiladas, recipes from the popular sites will work just fine.<p>There are many sites (not to mention books and periodicals) which have thought and care put into their recipes, often with supplementary material which helps you understand what you're doing and become a better cook, rather than just an ingredient-assembling automaton.<p>Another aspect to consider is that many people like to read (or watch) things about food but don't actually cook much. That's why the Food Network has become so popular (ever notice how all their commercials are for ready-made products?). A pet peeve of mine is to see 5-star reviews with a comment like, ""Looks delicious! Will try making it sometime."" Pretty annoying, but some people just like to watch. Maybe that's why recipes with pictures get higher ratings.",1266899891

What are the odds that the decisions that were made to create that team were really meritocratic? ""<p>By what kind of a priori logic does the author presume that any given meritocratic filter will happen to have an equal pass rate along arbitrarily chosen orthogonal characteristics such as race and gender?<p>For any given test for any kind of ability, I would be shocked if the population selected happened to perfectly fit the hiring-brochure rainbow. It's just not very likely. It is very possible that a more meritocratic selection procedure results in less diversity.<p>In fact, that's precisely what happened when California passed a referendum in the late 90s to forbid considering race in admissions to the University of California. The process became less biased and the results became less diverse. My apologies to the author's preconceived ideas.<p>>""Demographic diversity is an indicator. It’s a reasonable inference that a group that is homogeneous in appearance was probably chosen by a biased selector. Even if men have an innate advantage at software development, the gap would have to be massive in order to explain why startup after startup has an all-male team.""<p>Innate biological gender differences are not the only cause of differential average programming ability between gender populations. Sociological factors matter too.<p>While some of these sociological forces may be unjust and we might want to address them, that does not change the fact that by the time they reach adulthood the population of qualified programmers has many more males than females.

139164,story,,,28,23,mk,"Ask YC: Can someone explain this JP Morgan buyout of Bear Stearns for me?",,"Here is what I understand. Bear Sterns did not have enough liquid capital to distribute to investors seeking to withdraw their money, a bank run like in ""It's a Wonderful Life"". And now the Fed has helped or guaranteed those investments so that JP Morgan can buy them for $2 a share. I probably have something wrong there. My question is 1. Is what I just said somewhat right, and 2. What is the impact on the tax payer? Did the Fed provide any money to JP Morgan to buy Bear Sterns? And if they did is it a loan that they will have to pay back or a free handout?",1205783951

Feynman was a bit mystified as to why they used that picture, but he let it slide.<p>A few years later, a Swedish publisher wanted to use the bongo photo in an encyclopedia article about him.  Feynman was pretty upset by this, saying:<p>""The fact that I beat a drum has nothing to do with the fact that I do theoretical physics.  Theoretical physics is a human endeavor, one of the higher developments of human beings - and this perpetual desire to prove that people are human by showing that they do other things that a few other humans do (like playing bongo drums) is insulting to me.<p>I am human enough to tell you to go to hell.""\n(letter to Tord Pramberg, 4 January 1967)",1205783893

Mostly those are still technical skills, however...and when we bring in a third person later this year (not really ""founder"" status, but plenty of equity and a salary), it will be another technical person to help off-load some of the support and handle some of the ongoing UI and design work.  Though I may hire a part-time assistant to deal with the books and such before then, but no serious equity will be involved.  The fourth real hire will be an enterprise sales person who will see mainly commission-based compensation with some equity so that the long-term health of the company has some sway on their decisions.  Those hires will probably come pretty close together.<p>But every company is different.  Companies building much smaller web apps that require a lot more marketing, sales, PR, and evangelism than ours does could probably make use of a non-technical person much earlier in the process.",1205783327

There are Internet Explorer versions (5.5 and prior) that are effectively end-of-lifed.  No web developer has to think about the 5.5 hacks anymore, and any corporate intranet that relies on 5.5 hacks is screwed.  Has this been a problem?  I get the feeling that it has not, because a good MS-based IT department can spin the cost of rewriting its websites as part of the MS upgrade treadmill...  as part of the cost of upgrading to .NET, or .NET 2.0, or Vista, or Sharepoint, or Windows Server 2008, etc.  (And any business that has decided to get off of this treadmill is no longer among MS's paying customers.)<p>On the other hand, Microsoft's piecemeal approach to web standards is starting to hurt it.  The <i>de facto</i> web development best practice is now ""Develop for a standards-compliant browser first, then hack it until it looks right in IE.""  This hurts Microsoft because it means that most new webpages only work incidentally in IE; if a corner case of some new feature is accidentally missed in the IE rewrite, the workaround might well be: ""Try using Firefox until we get a fix out.""",1205781977

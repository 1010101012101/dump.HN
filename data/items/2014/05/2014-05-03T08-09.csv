The fact that it&#x27;s still a headline, points to the sensationalism that has surrounded this topic for years.<p>Gates no doubt cares a lot about Microsoft&#x27;s well being, but much like Jobs, he doesn&#x27;t need stock to exercise his influence. His #1 task financially these days (the last decade plus), is to protect his $80 billion in wealth. Articles like to sensationalize the selling for clicks, but it&#x27;s strictly logical to diversify out of his formerly concentrated MSFT position, and to ultimately balance risk vs returns, with the goal in mind to maximize how much wealth he can give away through the foundation.<p>Given his priorities, having $13 billion (16% of his net worth) tied up in Microsoft is still a sizable concentration. I would suspect he&#x27;ll sell that down to $4 to $8 billion before eventually holding a token position (for him).

The 68000 is impossible to fully virtualize directly - e.g. if you tried to write to memory the current process shouldn&#x27;t be able to access, there&#x27;d be no way to signal it without triggering an exception/trap that didn&#x27;t leave you with enough information to restart or continue the instruction. I think the 68010 fixed this.<p>I also seem to remember that there were 68000 boards that &quot;solved&quot; this by actually including two 68000&#x27;s on the board and running them in lock-step 2 cycles apart, or something, and then triggering a trap on both of them if the leading one triggered the MMU - that way the trailing CPU would be halted at a point where sufficient state was available to reset state on both of them..<p>Do you remember if you had to deal with anything like this? Or did it have simple enough requirements to get away without it (or actually run a 68010)?<p>I love the 68k family - after my C64, I got into Amiga&#x27;s, and I&#x27;m still disappointed Motorola didn&#x27;t manage to keep up.

That&#x27;s where it gets murkier.<p>No.  That argument is exactly why I <i>didn&#x27;t</i> just use /dev/urandom in PyCrypto&#x27;s userspace RNG when I wrote it in 2008.  The result was 5 years of a catastrophic failure in certain cases where fork() is used, even though I <i>specifically</i> designed it to cope with fork().  If someone hadn&#x27;t made that argument, PyCrypto wouldn&#x27;t have had a catastrophic failure mode that went undetected for 5 years until I stumbled across it: CVE-2013-1445 <a href=""http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/10/17/3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/10/17/3</a><p>It is surprisingly difficult to implement a fast, reliable CSPRNG in a crypto library.  There are innumerable things that can leak or corrupt your state, which compromises everything.  You can leak state as a result of multithreading, fork(), signal-handling, etc., and libraries generally can&#x27;t cope with that without having complicated APIs that application developers WILL misuse, causing silent security failures for end-users that go unnoticed for years.  Plus, since you&#x27;re still relying on /dev/urandom anyway, it really only gives you another way to fail.<p>Arguably, there are so few people who understand this stuff that---at least in the FOSS world---we should kill off all but one implementation, so that the few of us who collectively  understand how this stuff really works can focus on that one implementation.",1399105688

I know more than a handful of people (including me) who refused jobs from Google (often more than one time, for example I had to ask them to write down to not contact me again after the third time) <i>before</i> Snowden&#x27;s revelations. The reasons were multiple: &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot; is a joke, Google has been a big company for years now and not really a fun startupy place, it may happens that the job you want is not the kind of jobs that Google offers, and it&#x27;s not even true anymore (or at least, it is less and less) that having worked at Google make your resume special.",1399105048

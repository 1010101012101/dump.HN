You are right, from a ""User Experience"" perspective dividing up the web application's pages into sections for viewing and other sections for printing is probably not very good. <p>For some reason I thought you were talking about ""Reports"" and ""Reporting"" in general, as offered by the Report Viewer Controls in ASP.NET (using rdlc / rdl).<p>I have used CSS in the past to allow users to print pages (as they see it on the page) and it has worked well for me. Although Report Viewer Controls in ASP.NET have their own magical hold on the business users (Probably because they are made to look and feel similar to other Reporting Packages, which Business Users are comfortable with). So, I still think thats a good way to go, if that is your audience. :)<p>But, I do understand what you are saying and agree that there is the possibility of people using this technology where it shouldnt be used.

1750537,comment,1750073,1750220,0,0,Mz,,,"This thread (and especially this post) are interesting to me because I have considered -- on and off since I was a teen -- designing/making my own clothes (to meet my special needs) and, recently, toyed with the idea of doing something like that as a business (and all but dismissed the idea out of hand as just too much trouble).<p>Any thoughts on finding/making cotton-silk blend knits (for women)?  I rarely can find this but it is awesome when I can.  Silks are too expensive and too fragile for my lifestyle and rarely come in knits.  They shrink horribly when washed and just don't stand up to my lifestyle (which is rooted in keeping everything clean enough to stay well in spite of my medical condition, and dry-cleaning is not acceptable as I react badly to the chemicals). Most knits are cotton-polyester, not acceptable in my book.  I don't wear polyester....etc...etc.<p>I have gone so far as to look over a few websites that I felt had good online shopping interfaces for clothing.  Most of them suck big time.  I tend to prefer to shop in person for clothes, in part because most online clothes shopping is so bad.<p>So I have played with the idea a bit.  I looked up a site called ""French Rags"" because I know they do mass customization and they sell knits.  But it turns out they use a yarn blend I don't want (IIRC:  cotton-acrylic).  Good quality affordable clothes is really tough to find.  Nylon and some spandex is also acceptable for me.  But polyester is absolutely unacceptable, most other synthetics are not really very acceptable, and 100% cotton wrinkles so bad and therefore is too high maintenance.  Most of the clothes I buy is 95% cotton, 5% spandex or 90% nylon and 10% spandex.  I don't own an iron but can't afford to show up at work all wrinkled -- it's a violation of the dress code.  Knits with a little spandex generally avoids that issue altogether.<p>So, I have thought about a DIY approach to solve my problem and also thought that the amount of work involved, well, it might make sense to do it as a business rather than jump through all these hoops to dress one person.",1286031317

Passwords are generally hashed server-side before being stored anyway, and it wouldn't prevent any sort of man-in-the-middle attacks. The only benefit I see is that anyone sniffing the data before it gets hashed server-side would only see a hash with the power of a password rather than the password itself, making it less useful to use against other sites where the user might share the password. If you really need the security, though, go HTTPS.<p>I don't see any harm other than the inconvenience of needing JavaScript. Note that there could be weird failure cases though. As an example, if I initially sign up with NoScript active and send the raw password, then later enable JavaScript on your site and send it MD5'd, I wouldn't be allowed in.

Zuckerberg writes: ""I read over all the stuff you sent and it seems like it shouldn't take too long to implement, so we can talk about that after I get all the basic functionality up tomorrow night.""[9] The next day, on December 1st, 2003, Zuckerberg sent another email to the HarvardConnection team. ""I put together one of the two registration pages so I have everything working on my system now. I'll keep you posted as I patch stuff up and it starts to become completely functional.""[6] On December 4th, 2003, Zuckerberg writes: ""Sorry I was unreachable tonight. I just got about three of your missed calls. I was working on a problem set.""[6] On December 10, 2003: ""The week has been pretty busy thus far, so I haven't gotten a chance to do much work on the site or even think about it really, so I think it's probably best to postpone meeting until we have more to discuss. I'm also really busy tomorrow so I don't think I'd be able to meet then anyway.""[6] On December 17th, 2003, a week later: ""Sorry I have not been reachable for the past few days. I've basically been in the lab the whole time working on a cs problem set which I""m still not finished with.""[6] On January 8, 2004, Zuckerberg emailed to say he was ""completely swamped with work [that] week"" but had ""made some of the changes ... and they seem[ed] to e working great"" on his computer. He said he could discuss the site starting the following Tuesday, on Jan. 13.[9] On January 11th, 2004, Zuckerberg registered the domain name thefacebook.com.[12] Three days later, on January 14th, 2004, Zuckerberg met again with Tyler Winklevoss, Cameron Winklevoss and Divya Narendra about HarvardConnection, however, he never mentioned registering the domain name thefacebook.com or a competing website, rather he reported progress on HarvardConnection, told them he would continue to work on it, and would email the group later in the week.[9] On February 4th, 2004, Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com.<p>The Winklevosses and Narendra attempted to force the Harvard administration to act on what they viewed as a violation of the university’s honor code. They took the case to the Harvard Administrative Board and the university president Larry Summers, but it was ruled to be outside of university jurisdiction.[13]</i>",1286029719

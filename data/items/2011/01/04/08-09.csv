Bubbles don't typically start with the market leaders. Bubbles happen when investors extrapolate market leader valuations onto 3rd tier players. Sound the bubble alarm when you see this happening.""",1294131575

2066362,comment,2066084,2066278,0,0,mycroftiv,,,"Yes, I understand that bugs in the ""platform software"" used by many internet services have the potential to rapidly affect a lot of users. However, I believe that it is unreasonable to expect users who experience a crash in php, or mysql, or any important application you can name, to not talk about the crash that happened. Software bugs are just too common to impose that restrictive a standard. In general, I believe statements of the form ""this information is too dangerous to be shared publicly"" are suspect, and we should maintain a strong presumption that as a general rule, it is OK to talk about problems publicly. When it comes to security issues, there is a difference between releasing deliberately crafted 0-day arbitrary remote code execution techniques and just making a public report of a crash you experienced.<p>Perhaps the real issue is that the growing reliance upon internet services makes fault-tolerant engineering and fallback plans for handling failures very important. We need to make sure that hospitals/police/everything aren't dependent on systems that might break down completely because of bugs like this.",1294131245

2066359,comment,2065416,2065908,0,0,_delirium,,,"Maybe I hang out with too many cynical people, but the Heretics I've run into have usually been pretty popular with coworkers, at least if the Heretic is also a reasonably intelligent and sociable person (rather than the muttering-darkly-in-the-corner variety). Even a decent number of people who don't themselves have much interest attacking their boss / stupid corporate policies / etc., sometimes like to watch on the sidelines while someone else does, at least if they can avoid entanglement in the drama. But I guess most people I know are sort of default-cynical about organizations, policies, and management, so there's a default-positivity about someone who's spending their time railing against it, even if you think their energies are misguided/futile.<p>Though I guess it does get more problematic if they start attacking their coworkers as sheep/sellouts/etc. The popularity is easier to maintain if they stick to attacking management/bosses/policies and treat their coworkers as being on the same side.",1294131197

The simple fix: add a ""-ffloat-store"" flag to your CFLAGS.<p>The problematic function, zend_strtod, seems to parse the mantissa (2.225...011 part) and the exponent (-308 part) separately, calculate the <i>approximation</i> of m*10^e and successively improve that approximation until the error becomes less than 0.5ulp. The problem is that this particular number causes the infinite loop (i.e. the iteration does not improve the error at all) in 80-bit FP, but does not in 64-bit FP. Since x86-64 in general uses the SSE2 instruction set (with 64-bit FP) instead of the deprecated x87 it does not have this problem.",1294130849

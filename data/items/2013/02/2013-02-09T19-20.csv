For instance you could claim, and be mostly right, that everyone gets access to computers (via public libraries etc). Yet, not everyone gets access to training in effective computer use - that is reserved for ""some people get access"", where the rules are 'has enough money for proper training' (aka defining access rules on how much is already in your ""mine"" resoures).

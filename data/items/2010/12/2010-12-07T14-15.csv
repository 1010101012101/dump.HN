I've really always hated ""dark matter"" and ""dark energy"", as far as I'm concerned it's a terrible violation of the scientific method.<p>We have two observations: 1) the rotational speed of galaxies appears to be too high for the calculated mass such that the galaxies should fly apart but don't -and- 2) the expansion of the universe appears to be accelerating.<p>From these two observations, physicists have created theories for a new kind of mass and a new kind energy that has never been detected and don't fit any of our existing models. I'm not suggesting that it's impossible that these new forms exist, but it kinda seems like religion to me - we can't detect it in any way but are supposed to have ""faith"" that it's there because there's no other readily available explanation for something in the world around us. It's possible, but isn't it much more plausible that we're merely missing a much more reasonable explanation? Maybe some of the things we hold as constants aren't constants (such as the mass in each galaxy).<p>We shouldn't dismiss dark matter outright, but we also shouldn't treat it as the only, or even the most likely explanation.",1291733917

In those environments, I could see .Net's adoption accelerating due to the perception of strife within the Java community: James Gosling and Tim Bray both leaving Oracle, Jonathan Schwartz pitching litigation over Java patents as a revenue stream, the subsequent lawsuit against Google, the OpenSolaris and OpenOffice.org votes of no confidence and subsequent forks, Apache attempting to throw a wrench into the JCP... that's not the picture of a healthy ecosystem.<p>So it's not that the enterprises will see Oracle and flee, but that they'll see the turmoil and litigation, reason that C# and Java are similar enough, and opt for the more peaceful of the two, at least for new development.",1291733302

1979165,comment,1978496,1978496,0,0,blahedo,,,"There are at least three different lines of inquiry here:<p>- Hypothesis testing.  If the [null] hypothesis is that p(heads) is 1, you can't prove this, only disprove it.  So: ""doesn't sway"".  Not very interesting, but there it is.<p>- Simple Bayesian.  The probability of his claim given that it comes up heads, p(C|H), is the prior of his claim, p(C), times p(H|C), divided by p(H).  Well, p(H|C) is 1 (that <i>is</i> the claim), and p(H), if I fudge things a little bit, is about 1/2, so p(C|H) should be about double p(C)---assuming p(C) is very low to start with.[0][2]<p>- Complex Bayesian.  There's a hidden probability in the simple case, because p(C) is encompassing both my belief in coins generally and also my belief about Tom's truthtelling.  So really I have p(C) ""p that the claim is true"" but also p(S) ""p that Tom stated the claim to me"".  Thus also p(S|C) ""p that if the claim were true, Tom would state this claim to me"" and p(C|S) ""p of the claim being true given that Tom stated it to me""; but also the highly relevant p(S|not C) ""p of that if the claim were NOT true, Tom would state this claim to me ANYWAY"" and a few other variants.  When you start doing Bayesian analysis with more than two variables you nearly always need to account for both p(A|B) and p(A|not B) for at least some of the cases, even where you could sometimes fudge this in the simpler problems.<p>SO this brings us to a formulation of the original question as: what is the relationship between p(C|S,H) and p(C|S)?  The former as
   p(H|C,S)p(C,S)/(p(C,S,H) + p(not C,S,H))
and then
   p(H|C,S)p(C,S)/(p(H|C,S)p(C,S) + p(H|not C,S)p(not C,S))
and if I take p(H|C,S) as 1 (given) and p(H|not C,S) as 1/2 (approximate), I'm left with
   p(C,S)/(p(C,S) + 0.5p(not C,S))
For the prior quantity p(C|S), a similar set of rewrites gives me
   p(C,S)/(p(C,S) + p(not C,S))
Now I'm in the home stretch, but I'm not done.<p>Here we have to break down p(C,S) and p(not C,S).  For p(C,S) we can use p(C)p(S|C), which is ""very small"" times ""near 1"", assuming Tom would be really likely to state that claim if it were true (wouldn't <i>you</i> want to show off your magic coin?).  The other one's more interesting.  We rewrite p(not C,S) as p(not C)p(S|not C), which is ""near 1"" times ""is Tom just messing with me?"".<p>Because a <i>crucial</i> part of this analysis, which is missing in the hypothesis-test version or in the simpler Bayesian model, but ""obvious"" to anyone who approaches it from a more intuitive standpoint, is that it matters a <i>lot</i> whether you think Tom might be lying in the first place, and whether he's the sort that would state a claim like this just to get a reaction or whatever.  In the case where you basically trust Tom (""he wouldn't say that unless he at least thought it to be true"") then the terms of p(C,S) + p(not C,S) might be of comparable magnitude, and multiplying the second of them by 1/2 will have a noticeable effect.  But if you think Tom likely to state a claim like this, even if false, just for effect (or any other reason), then p(C,S) + p(not C,S) is <i>hugely</i> dominated by that second term, which would be many orders of magnitude larger than the first, and so multiplying that second term by 1/2 is still going to leave it orders of magnitude larger, and the overall probability—even with the extra evidence—remains negligible.<p>[0] This clearly breaks if p(C) is higher than 1/2, because twice that is more than 1.  If we assume that the prior p(H) is a distribution over coins, centred on the fair ones and with a long tail going out to near-certainty at both ends, the claim ""this coin is an always-heads coin""[1] is removing a chunk of that distribution in the H direction, meaning that p(H|not C) is actually slightly, very slightly, greater than 1/2.  This is the ""fudge"" I refer to above that lets me put the p(H) as 1/2.  Clearly if my prior p(C) is higher than ""very small"" this would be inconsistent with the prior p(H) I've described.<p>[1] I'm further assuming that ""always"" means ""reallllllly close to always"", because otherwise the claim is trivially false and the problem isn't very interesting.<p>[2] Note that this is not actually a ""naive Bayesian"" approach---that's a technical term that means something more complicated.",1291733261

What is robbing a caravan compared with plundering twenty-seven kingdoms? For instance, eight hundred camels were insufficient to carry the gold pillaged only from Damascus. Nobody ever counted the wealth ravished from India… Rivers of gold and silver poured over the gravel of diamond and pearls at the feet of the Master. It was said that the loot gathered by Genghis Khan’s hordes ended up in Timur’s hands too. In Samarkand, like all over the empire, endless numbers of palaces, gardens and treasury chambers belonged all to one man – the Emir. Everything belonged to him.</i><p><i>Then, one cold winter day, on his way to conquering China, the old tyrant drunk too much arak and died. Unexpectedly, for the Iron Emir seemed immortal. After this event, Nasreddin hastened back to Horto, his childhood village. Even there, the death of the emperor was on people’s lips. Everybody wondered what wealth was bequeathed to his heirs by the great Tamerlane, richest man on earth.</i><p><i>“Hodja,” asked Camal the barber,” you lived at Tamerlane’s court, spent your day in his presence and luxury, saw his possessions. You must know. How much did he leave?”</i><p><i>Nasreddin, closed his eyes in concentration and counted for a while in his mind.

While hardly more pointless than most of that War's assaults, it was more or less the first time we had fought as a sovereign nation and Murdoch's efforts helped shock our young country to that war in general, and the results of our troops still being commanded by our former colonial masters. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_Campaign"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_Campaign</a><p>* The Fitzgerald Inquiry in the state of Queensland revealed corruption that ran through the police force and (via the Police Commissioner) into Cabinet and the Premier. Joh Bjelke-Petersen had been running Queensland for 19 years, supported by the gerrymander in state politics. We Queenslanders have a chip on our shoulder about being overlooked by the officials 'down south' - Joh worked this masterfully (in one election campaign he called Queensland the greatest 'Country' on earth) and while he is still remembered fondly for 'sticking it up them', the corruption of that era is a blight on the nation. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joh_Bjelke-Petersen"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joh_Bjelke-Petersen</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzgerald_Inquiry"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzgerald_Inquiry</a> Incidentally, Chris Masters' famous piece of journalism 'The Moonlight State' was seen as instrumental in propelling public support towards an Inquiry and a change of government.<p>Assange seems to be positioning himself as another in the long line of Australian journalists (and Australians generally) who believe the 'powers' want to hide the truth.

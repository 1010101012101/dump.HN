9904118,comment,9902871,9903818,0,0,winsletts,,,"We tested with PGPool and PgBouncer in various iterations.<p>PGPool failed at basic failover.  It worked fine while the leader remained leader.  It would failover to the follower who became leader, but after the first failover, it would stall on connections.  We worked through various settings and attempts at making it more stable, but in the end we were not happy with the stability.<p>PGBouncer requires a connection to a single database and requires a user store associated at the PGBouncer level.  One of our internal requirements for our Postgres service is give customers full access to Postgres capabilities.  PGBouncer would either limit customer functionality or require us to build more tools for customers to use Postgres&#x27;s complete functionality.  For instance, if a customer ran `CREATE USER foo WITH LOGIN …` from the Postgres connection, the customer would not be authenticate as foo user because PGBouncer would not have immediate knowledge of the new user.<p>In the end, HAProxy offered the stability and enabled the base functionality of Postgres we wanted.  In tests, it failed over quickly and reliably.  The only caveat with HAProxy + Postgres is that you have to rely on TCP passthrough with SSL termination at Postgres.  We&#x27;d have preferred the SSL termination at HAProxy, but Postgres engineered it&#x27;s own connecting procedure to listen for standard and SSL connections on the same port.  SSL termination at the HAProxy was causing issues for drivers that were built to use that procedure and cannot use a standard SSL connection.",1437155834

9904095,comment,9902564,9903374,0,0,FiatLuxDave,,,"Your answer is correct, but remember that if we are heating steam, it is at a much higher temperature differential than a typical heat pump.  Good luck getting a COP of 3.5 from room temperature up to steam engine temperature.  Steam engines operate at well above 100C.  Actually, good luck even finding a heat pump that will operate at those kind of temperatures.<p>There is a huge gap in what is commercially available in high temperature heat pumps for e.g. boiling water.  The best example that I am aware of is the EcoCute for water heating.  Heat pumps are much more efficient for heating water for domestic use than resistive heating.  However, the only ones on the market are fairly expensive.  I&#x27;d be very interested if someone on HN knew of a better option.<p>I&#x27;ve tried building my own high temperature heat pump to go up to around 300C.  It isn&#x27;t easy, because most refrigerator technology is not designed to operate above 100C, so if you use off-the-shelf parts the seals will go or various temperature limit switches will actuate.  Then if you try marrying engine parts to AC parts, you have to make your own high-pressure adapters.  Overall, its a great way to burn a lot of dollars and hours in the garage.<p>I&#x27;ve considered just buying a Stirling engine and running it backwards, but I&#x27;ve not yet found one which is designed to be able to run effectively as a heat pump.  Any Stirling aficionados here?  I&#x27;d love some advice on using a Stirling as a heat pump.",1437155700

That&#x27;s why your conclusions are outlandish- Microsoft was literally deemed to violate antitrust law in federal court; there are plenty of obvious historical examples  (United Fruit, Standard Oil, US Steel); Pharmaceutical companies consistently exhibit price gouging in medical monopolies, etc. Furthermore, oligarchical monopolies, like the telecoms, are not somehow exempt- they operate, lobby, coerce, and consolidate power together, despite being 3 separate companies. Utilities are generally natural monopolies, not government created- the major barrier is the huge costs on upfront infrastructure, which dwarf any regulatory costs. \nMost importantly though, you failed to grasp the fundamental concept, that a government granted monopoly is not somehow uncapitalistic: it&#x27;s hypercapitalism, the end goal of the system itself.",1437155692

9904085,comment,9901915,9901915,0,0,tpeaton,,,"I&#x27;m a relatively new developer at 33, with about 2 years of experience now.  I was in a different industry for 12 years, but always wanted to be a dev.  I dropped out of CS about 13 years ago after I chose a bad (for profit) school that I didn&#x27;t enjoy.  I enrolled in a local state school a couple months before getting the job I have now.  I&#x27;m half way through my degree, working full time and going to school about half time (6-9 credits per semester).  I don&#x27;t know if I would reccomend it or not.  I only went back because I needed to take concrete steps to get myself on the career path I wanted.  Now that I&#x27;m in it, it&#x27;s a bit of a struggle to stay motivated for school.<p>Pros:<p>-I&#x27;ll have a degree at some point and will no longer have to have awkward conversations about why I don&#x27;t have a degree.  This is probably the #1 reason I&#x27;m doing it.<p>-It removes a way for employers to filter me without seriously considering me as a candidate.<p>-I&#x27;ll be proud of my accomplishment at some point and won&#x27;t feel bad every time I think about my relationship with college.<p>Cons:<p>-Money.  At a local state school, nothing crazy, I&#x27;ll be about $35k in debt by the end of it with plenty of up front costs (books, etc).<p>-Time.  It eats an incredible amount of time.  Some classes require an hour or so of study time outside of class, but many require a ton.  Depending on how polished your math skills are, you&#x27;ll have a huge wall to climb here.  I hadn&#x27;t been in a math class in 13 years and then get tossed into calculus. Yowch.  In addition to 5 or so hours of class time, I probably put in 10 hours a week of studying/homework just for that one course.<p>-Scheduling.  Your scheduling needs might be different, but I work a pretty standard workday of 9-5.  The university&#x27;s latest CS courses start at 5:30 two days a week, which means if I am taking two CS courses simultaneously, I&#x27;m in class four nights a week.  That means studying has to happen on virtually every off night.  It also makes it very tough to take more than 2 classes at a time.  Keeping a decent pace is key to actually finishing in a reasonable time.  It&#x27;ll probably take me 5 years total to get through it all.<p>-Content.  The actual courses will drive you crazy.  Professor&#x27;s requirements are usually a clinic in what not to do in the real world.  Your good habits will be punished in many circumstances.  About half way through, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve learned anything invaluable that I couldn&#x27;t have learned better on my own if I were sufficiently motivated.  I&#x27;m hoping the upper class courses are more interesting, but so far it&#x27;s been a bust.<p>-Bandwidth.  You only have so many hours in a day.  You&#x27;ll be spending your time on things you have to learn instead of the things you WANT to learn.  I&#x27;d love to spend my evenings getting more proficient with modern tech, but instead I find myself reading about anthropology or the like.  My university is very Java/C/C++ heavy, which is not what I prefer.  I&#x27;m happy to learn these things, but I don&#x27;t see myself ever being a happy Java dev professionally.<p>So there are a lot more cons than there are pros for me, but I think the pros are still worth it.  I&#x27;ll let you know in a couple years.  If you&#x27;re looking to be indy dev, I doubt a college degree will help you get where you want to go.  I&#x27;d spend that time and effort on a project of your own.  By the end of it, you&#x27;ll have demonstrable skills and a product you can show off.",1437155630

The very first one was <i>awesome</i> and I thought, &quot;Wow, this is great&quot;. Then every single cleaner after that was terrible. Two of them started wet mopping before vacuuming or using a dry swiffer, thus pushing wet dirt around. Another one let the toilet brush sit in the toilet in a way that the entire brush, handle and all, fell in. When I came over to oversee her, to make sure she doesn&#x27;t do other things like that, she got angry and refused to work until I went into another room.<p>As other&#x27;s have said, the model sucks.

The customer expects convenience and high quality service. If you cannot provide both those things, why would people use Homejoy?

Measuring fat loss by tracking weight is less accurate, because muscle is heavier than fat, if you are exercising to lose fat you may get heavier due to increased muscle mass, even though you are thinner, i.e. carrying less fat. There are other factors that affect your weight, such as water retention. As for why to measure at the hip, well, there isn&#x27;t much muscle around that area compared to say your thigh, so the size of the muscle is not affecting the measurement output so much, meaning you are measuring fat loss, rather than fat+muscle loss/gain. (Muscle loss is generally not a good thing, it&#x27;s very important to our health).<p>Personally I think we need a way to measure our <i>health</i> rather than tracking metrics that can encourage unhealthy relationships with our bodies. Ideally we would be able to quickly assess how close we are to a healthy level of body fat, lean muscle mass, be it is too high or too low. Measuring how heavy / big you are feeds into &quot;weight status&quot; and &quot;thigh gap&quot; fixation. In a less-imperfect world we&#x27;d be competitive about how healthy we are, rather than silly and often unhealthy things like thinness, and weight.",1437155300

You can&#x27;t, the only BSSRDF profiles that Cycles offer are simple bicubic and gaussian profiles, these wouldn&#x27;t work for rendering realistic skin. Cycles doesn&#x27;t even offer a simple dipole. Renderman on the other hand offers a dipole, it offers the state of the Photon Beam Diffusion, it offers Pixar&#x27;s recent approximate BSSRDF, which is almost as accurate as PBD and is as easy to compute as a gaussian or a bicubic profile. So you&#x27;d have to implement your own BSSRDF shader, which is only doable for large studios such as Weta which have their own R&D department.<p>So let&#x27;s say you want to render hair. You can do this with Cycles, but their importance sampling code is not state of the art (last time I checked), which means that you can probably expect double the amount of noise in Cycles. You could still use this for rendering, but computing time is quite limited (especially if artists want to compute previews). You&#x27;d either have to implement your own hair shader, or you&#x27;d have to purchase a ton of extra hardware.<p>Let&#x27;s say you want to render a scene with tons of triangles and textures, you probably won&#x27;t be able to do that in Cycles. They don&#x27;t use special tricks for quantizing those triangles in the memory. Their code for caching textures (sometimes multiple terabytes for a single scene), is also not as good as Renderman, especially when using the GPU (a GPU isn&#x27;t very good at constantly streaming terabytes of data into it), which means that your texture date either needs to be limited, or you&#x27;d need to throw a lot of rendering machines at it.<p>Cycles can do most stuff that Renderman (or Arnold) can, but that&#x27;s not the point. If you&#x27;d pay me to work on a renderer for you fulltime for a year, I could produce a feature complete renderer, but it won&#x27;t be optimized. The code won&#x27;t be optimized, but probably more importantly the ray intersection code and the importance sampling code won&#x27;t be optimized, which means that renders will be slow and noisy. Pixar has a whole team working on optimizing their code and whole team of researchers working on improving the importance sampling. Cycles is made by hobbyists who are doing an excellent job (Cycles is an amazing renderer for amateur users), but it&#x27;s just not in the same ballpark as Renderman or Arnold.<p>Cycles is an absolutely amazing renderer, but it just lacks a lot of stuff that you&#x27;d during production of feature movies. If you want to use Cycles for your own use I can absolutely recommend it, it will have everything you need and it&#x27;s open source!",1437154628

An industry, arguably the most aggressively capitalistic.<p>He&#x27;s not talking about the info-tech industry being capitalistic, but rather some of the contradictions inherent within a capitalistic info-tech industry. Relying on scarcity of a product that has effectively zero marginal cost is a very strange place to be in.<p>> Then he talks about corporate monopolies (anyone who&#x27;s read economics 101 would tell you corporate monopolies are rarely result of unadulterated capitalism, but rather state corporatism).<p>And anyone who&#x27;s gotten beyond econ 101 knows that these black-and-white conceptions of the econ 101 capitalism have little to do with modern economic discourse or policy.<p>> He mentions big companies using public data, most of that public data is generated, collected and shared openly by private companies to start with. I&#x27;m not even sure what his point was there...<p>His point was that trying to make a business around owning, hoarding, and making scarce the public and private interactions of the populace at large (e.g. Facebook) is a shaky foundation.<p>> Then he talks about alternative currencies, something which bloomed in response to flailing, devaluing state currencies. Which is just about the most free-market response to state currencies...<p>This is where I started to become really convinced you had missed the forest for the trees. Yes, non-state currencies are a pet project of free-market purists. Yes, they are also a huge pet project of post-capitalists and marxists. If you would stop labeling the author as one of &quot;them&quot; in your political world-view that you are sworn to defeat, I think you may start to see a lot of parallels between what he&#x27;s describing and what you seem to think of as &quot;free-market capitalism&quot;.<p>> The next paragraph he references briefly the &#x27;sharing economy&#x27;, something pioneered and spearheaded by companies such as Airbnb and Lyft. Truly great success stories of consumer capitalism.<p>Again, you&#x27;re so obsessed with your definitions of these labels that you&#x27;re missing the whole point. &quot;AirBnB and Lyft are private companies, therefore they cannot have anything to do with a large-scale transition in market dynamics!&quot; sounds rather silly, don&#x27;t you think? Especially when the author speaks incessantly about how new models are emerging naturally within old systems rather than the traditionally marxist conception of workers using the state to effect change?<p>> &quot;The solutions have been austerity plus monetary excess. But they are not working.&quot; - What? Our public spending has increases by £50bn, how is this &#x27;austerity&#x27;? The cuts have slowed down our public spending and even that has made us one of the strongest economies in Europe. So I&#x27;m not sure where he&#x27;s getting the &#x27;not working&#x27; from.<p>I don&#x27;t know what world you live in where you don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re in a period of &quot;austerity&quot; right now. That&#x27;s literally all that finance ministers and politicians and bankers and economists are talking about. Whether or not this fits your pet definition of what &quot;austerity&quot; should mean, the rest of us are going to continue using that word in the way that we have been using it and all seem to understand just fine.<p>> Most of the fluffy scenarios he describes, whereby private individuals make voluntary, mutually beneficial agreements with each other, is almost the very definition of capitalism!<p>Again -- you&#x27;re focusing on proving the author wrong (&quot;Haha! Contracts made without threats of violence are capitalism, but you said capitalism was ending!&quot;) rather than even beginning to listen to what he was saying in a holistic manner.<p>If you&#x27;re fanatically obsessed with defending a econ 101 definition of capitalism: sure, you got him. There will still be voluntary mutually beneficial agreements; capitalism will survive.<p>For the rest of us: this article was not about the word &quot;capitalism&quot;, it was about what arrangement of &quot;voluntary, mutually beneficial agreements&quot; can be expected to exist, writ large, in a system where marginal cost of production quickly approaches zero.",1437154043

However, as we understand more, we have to teach people more. This brings in two problems that I see:<p>- It takes longer for people to learn up to the frontier of science, which means they might be in their 30s, 40s, and that number may keep getting larger.\n - We might be able to teach these things in the same amount of time, but the understand of these topics by the younger generation might be less overall, which makes it difficult for them to make certain connections, as they might not have the deep enough understanding to see a connection.<p>My worry is the eventually we will reach a stage where the amount of knowledge we have is so much that no one can feasibly master a field. We can subdivide the fields, but no one will know enough general knowledge to make insightful connections that simplifies our models, or something to that effect.<p>As an example: my fluid dynamics professor said that the fluids mechanics I course we take in second year undergrad is what people worked on as their masters/phd thesis 100 years ago, whereas we don&#x27;t even derive the formulas anymore now simply because we do not have the time to do so.",1437154004

9903796,comment,9902790,9903235,0,0,jessriedel,,,"In terms of progress on fundamental physics (i.e., ignoring things like material science), this is a very slow crawl on any sensible absolute scale, and certainly vastly slower than progress was made up until the 1970s.  With respect, I think you&#x27;re just renormalizing to the glacial pace we&#x27;ve come to expect.<p>The Standard Model (including the yet-to-be discovered Higgs and top quark) was completed in the mid &#x27;70s around when the bottom and charm quark were found.  The pace of discovery of new fundamental particles has clearly slowed dramatically; the top quark was in 1994 and Higgs was just a couple of years ago, with serious pessimism that anything else will come out of the LHC (even with the luminosity upgrades).  The existence of an LHC successor is uncertain, and even if it is built it is unlikely to find anything new.<p>The solar neutrino, compared to just about any other fundamental physics question in the 20th century, is <i>boring</i>.  It was solved by adding a few additional free parameters to the SM with little conceptual insight and few implications for further post-SM physics.  As you and I commented elsewhere, pentaquarks are a neat window into low-energy QCD, but they aren&#x27;t new fundamental physics.<p>Precision cosmology&#x27;s biggest result was to confirm the ad hoc and simplest inflationary models from the 1980&#x27;s, with little hope in the near-term future to do anything besides rule out poorly motivated variations designed explicitly to be testable.  What is the inflaton like, and what does it do besides adjust a couple of parameters in the CMB?  No one knows, and know one has a serious expectation of finding out anytime soon.<p>None of this, obviously, means that these meager accomplishments weren&#x27;t <i>hard</i> or that the people who made them aren&#x27;t extremely clever.  But they are undeniably less exciting then what was see before I was born in 1985, and pale in comparison to the absolute revolutions of the first half of the 20th century (quantum mechanics, relativity, GR, field theory).<p>I really want to call this out:<p>>  huge swaths of parameter space (i.e. possible theories) have been ruled out.<p>This is the sort of comment that only us physicists can say with a straight face.  Parameter space is bounded only by one&#x27;s cleverness and stamina. Ruling it out says very little about reality because most proposals have very little a priori probability.  The entire industry of constructing complicated models and then ruling them out is the lamest kind of progress I can imagine.  Perhaps the open questions have really just gotten so hard that this is the best that can be hoped for.

9903782,comment,9902524,9902524,0,0,burningion,,,"I just started going down this path. I began with using audio analysis to do some machine learning. (Detecting a specific audio pattern very easily recognizable to humans). Can&#x27;t get too specific about it, as it&#x27;s under NDA. But I had a little under two weeks to get a prototype built that either proved or disproved it would be possible.<p>The very first thing I did was take a step back and understand the domain of the data I was working with, and what the best way to present it for machine learning would be. In my case, I had to understand what the best format for presenting my audio would be (slightly modified MFCCs), and what the best library would be to get my data in that format.<p>Next, I needed to build a data set of proper training data. This mean I had to manually build a (largish) data set that matched exactly what I was looking for. So I went and downloaded a bunch of example audio, and then manually went through it, tagging it into the two bins I was looking to differentiate against.<p>Once I had this, (which actually took much more time than the learning itself), I was ready to do the actual machine learning itself. I used Theano, and figuring out how to translate my dataset into a format digestible by Theano took another chunk of time. Once I had my data in the proper format for Theano, it came down to basically playing with how I presented my initial data to Theano, and then tweaking my gradient.<p>Finally, I was able to train and get a net that was about 80% right with my hypothesis. There were a few edge cases I hadn&#x27;t anticipated that wouldn&#x27;t necessarily work well, but it gave us enough confidence to go through with more machine learning for our project.<p>So, takeaway suggestions: find a real project, something you want to learn, and then just do it. Gather knowledge of your data, build a dataset, and test a hypothesis. Most of this isn&#x27;t machine learning, it&#x27;s mostly just moving and shaping data, and knowing what in your data is significant. The machine learning algorithms are really just a tiny piece of the whole picture. Good luck.",1437153459

Usually, the way to address this is to solve a small subset of the problem. If you don&#x27;t know how to pay for the parking in a particular place, don&#x27;t park there. Things like that.

There are even systems which already exist that do something similar to this; toll roads, toll bridges, et cetera: you put a little device on the front of your car and that records your usage of the relevant infrastructure, which is then charged to your account.<p>Put a bunch of image recognition for parking signs in the car - good parking space usually follow fairly straightforward formats; I&#x27;m not sure whether the signage is defined in statute or regulation, but generally they&#x27;re much alike.

9903738,comment,9839466,9903029,0,0,rmxt,,,"Fair point. I had never heard of  the concept of &quot;just-so stories.&quot; Discarding everything and creating a new framework from the ground-up would be great, and perhaps the best way of doing things. It appears that &quot;just-so stories&quot; are the quick retort and dismissal for arguments from evolution and nature. (&quot;Humans, great apes, etc. naturally form bond pairs&quot; statements and the like.) Despite this, I think that we both accept that the state should regulate contract agreements for the benefit of both parties involved (e.g. ensuring enforcement, reducing exploitative contracts, unless you go full-on anarcho-capitalist). If we want to call a type of contract, between two parties, for a specific purpose (financial interdependence, possibly rearing children, etc.), a certain &quot;m-word,&quot; then why is it absurd for the state to regulate this special type of contract, but not any other contract? The state regulating contracts has benefits (that I think we both accept), the state regulating marriage shares many of those same common goods, such as ensuring fulfillment, ensuring an absence of duress, and the like.<p>As for the question of &quot;why dyadic?&quot; but not poly... the complexities built into poly marriage are intrinsically different than one-one marriage. Our current legal system isn&#x27;t ready to handle poly marriage, to bite the bullet that you&#x27;ve offered me. It is hard to separate out the impacts of polygamy from other cultural impacts, but some speculate that polygamy has some unique negative impacts on childrearing. [1]<p>I would still ask that my question from above be answered. Given our current frameworks and regulations, was the denial of the civil acknowledgement of SSM a form of discrimination?<p>My flippant attitude in past comments notwithstanding, I am terrified at the backlash that you continue to receive. Frankly, I didn&#x27;t realize how all-pervasive it was, nor do I ever personally feel the need to get on Twitter to insult people (a la your link) or call for a third party&#x27;s head (a la your personal story). Criticism and questioning for fitness of a particular role is one thing, but public evisceration is another. I can acknowledge and accept a opposing position whereby one seeks to abolish the civil institution of marriage altogether, for gay, straight, whatever, alike, which is what I&#x27;m coming to understand your position to be. But, I do find it hard to fathom how one can decide that &quot;today&#x27;s line&quot; gets drawn before gay marriage, while also somehow respecting and acting fairly towards gay people in their day-to-day lives (which is where I thought your beliefs laid before this exchange). My sympathy ends there. Personally, I won&#x27;t be one to crusade for the personal decimation that you seem to think I enjoy. I do believe that creating a culture whereby one is building up &quot;pseudo-reasons&quot; against gay marriage, like talking about looming bestiality and pedophilia, is as despicable as those that are using their sexuality to create misery for others. (Like the culturally vindictive lesbian woman in your article. By no means am I a prude: her path to children doesn&#x27;t make me cringe, but her quote-on-quoted attitude does.)<p>Implicit self-righteousness regarding illumination aside, I break the TWS article into a couple of mish-mashes of fearmongering, mixed with some valid points about malicious intent amongst specific members of the SSM/LGBT movement:<p>- Statistics that attempt to minimize the weight that is, or should be, given to the &quot;homosexual agenda,&quot; as this article would imply that there&#x27;s such a coherent and unified front, by the mere fraction of LGQ people in the population. Civil rights are civil rights, no matter how great or small the magnitude.<p>- Statistics and quotes that attempt to criticize the way of life of LGQ people by implying that there is something wrong with less-than-monogamous relationships while married.<p>- Highlighting questionable behaviors and attitudes co-opted by people who also happen to be LGQ (people using impregnation as a tool of retribution are idiots regardless of orientation)<p>- Some really outright fearmongering about state interference in direct religious ceremonies. (Requiring that religiously affiliated employers give out birth control is pretty sane, thinking that somehow the state will turn to mandating that priests <i>must</i> marry gay people in a church/synagogue/etc. is not sane. What might be sane is to say that all marriage license clerks, regardless of religious affiliation, must adhere to the federal law. That&#x27;s not a hindrance to whatever a particular religion&#x27;s beliefs are.)<p>- Highlighting particular cases of activists that are pushing the cultural envelope for the definition of the &quot;m-word&quot;. I don&#x27;t understand the need for this here... the author doesn&#x27;t exactly state why this person is doing a bad thing, but merely is preaching to a choir that must already think 3+ marriages are distasteful.<p>- The entire last page is one big &quot;begging the question&quot;...<p>The article doesn&#x27;t answer what &quot;culture&quot; will explicitly be destroyed by the legalization of gay marriage. It speculates that cultural change may abound and be desired by the LGBT movement. The article is hypocritical in that it is seeking a &quot;live-and-let-live&quot; approach to be taken by LGBT supporters (&quot;let the Catholic Charities adopt out to whomever they want&quot;), while at the same time implying that LGBT people shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to marry one another (&quot;let two people get married if they want to get married&quot;). There <i>is</i> bad faith on part of some of LGBT activists; some want far more than equality. Let&#x27;s not kid ourselves though, bad faith on the part of some LGBT activists is no excuse for not working within the pre-existing legal and cultural frameworks that the West has, and striving for equality under those frameworks.<p>This is perhaps the biggest whopper of all: &quot;Support for traditional marriage stems from many sources, including respect for natural law and the prudential concern that holding any line will become impossible once the core definition of marriage is tampered with.&quot; What is &quot;traditional marriage&quot;? What is &quot;the core definition?&quot;  For this articles audience, presumably the &quot;core definition&quot; is that it&#x27;s a man and a woman. These are the exact same arguments that you are criticizing me for, and they are a shift of the goal posts. How can one argue for the legalization of anything, if all one wants to do is point to this line that we supposedly <i>must</i> maintain? It&#x27;s not fair to have to argue against a slippery slope.<p>[1] <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1020925123016"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1020925123016</a>",1437152887
9903737,comment,9902790,9902790,0,0,yk,,,"That depends, how do you quantify progress or rate of progress in physics? To compare directly to technology, Moore&#x27;s law seems to indicate a accelerating pace of technology. On the other hand looking back to the 90ies progress in computer games, where you could expect a never seen before breakthrough each year, it seems that computers have hit a point of diminishing returns and probably the important metric is something like the log of computing power or something similar. So quantifying rate of progress is not well defined and it seems that it is possible to argue that the rate of progress has slowed down, even for computing power. The counter example would be digital video, where there was very little progress, for the average user, until divX and since the early two thousands, we went from cut scenes at 320x240, to Youtube and 4K video.<p>Putting the measurement problems aside, progress in physics seems to be a lot less smooth and the big jump occurred in the first three decades of the last century with the discovery of special relativity and quantum mechanics plus the ongoing project of formalizing physics. That one was a complete paradigm shift towards mathematical models and towards an entirely different picture of reality. Since then the development of quantum field theories is basically just using the same trick as for quantum mechanics. ( Not trying to belittle the development of QFT, that is one of the monumental achievements of the human mind, it just pales in comparison to the development of QM. ) So, in this view the next big jump may be just around the corner or not possible for a human brain, but we will only know the answer after progress happened. ( I should cite one of the famous philosophers of science here, unfortunately I forgot which one.)<p>As an example, string theory is currently not even wrong, because we can not build the known experiments that would enable us to test string theory. However a lot of brain power and ink was expended on its development over the last thirty years, and we simply do not have a good idea if it was worthwhile. If someone suggests a experiment that can distinguish between string theory and other models of quantum gravity, and if a string theory passes this test, then it was probably worthwhile to spend all that effort.<p>In conclusion, I would argue that the question is ill defined and runs furthermore in epistemological problems, that is even if we would find a good definition we can not really know the answer. However, I am actually quite optimistic that a breakthrough is just around the corner. For example, I think that the connection of information theory and physics is not really understood, but concepts like entropy and information seem to crop up everywhere one looks.",1437152885

Can rewrite themselves as many times as needed and very fast, too. Flexibility means more price, more watts, and less performance than truly custom chip. Yet, having custom circuits for the job can make an application SCREAM with performance. Here&#x27;s some concepts for you.<p>1. Compression, encryption, etc that&#x27;s many times faster (50x on some algorithms).<p>2. Do high-end streaming workloads (eg HD video, NIDS) on embedded hardware with hardly any watts.<p>3. Put specialized audio, AI, whatever engines in the FPGA for video games that take it to the next level with a whole CPU left for main game logic.<p>4. Implement a concurrent, hardware, garbage collector to write your whole OS in memory-safe language and not have freezes due to GC.<p>5. Use onboard I/O, often many lanes at Gbps, to get crazy throughput on any number of disk, networking, wireless, etc use-cases.<p>6. Use custom I/O for real-time applications.<p>7. Simulate other forms of hardware on the FPGA for personal learning or product development. Can deploy it in production on FPGA boards later.<p>8. Forget software emulators: build the hardware itself on the FPGA and have accurate simulation.<p>9. Cutting edge techniques do something similar with mockups of normal hardware which are modified to spot the exact time and place certain bugs happen. Then you can see everything from the input that caused it to the internal state of the processor. And fix it.<p>10. My use-case: processors modified to prevent code injection or data leaks to run applications that hackers can&#x27;t hit. Altera&#x27;s I&#x27;d use for prototyping then put them on anti-fuse FPGA&#x27;s: write-once FPGA&#x27;s that blow circuits intentionally to prevent attackers or glitches from modifying the system&#x27;s logic. ROP that, bitches!<p>In short, you can use FPGA&#x27;s for anything you can use a custom circuit for. They&#x27;ll just be a bit weaker and usually depend on a host system to set them up. Common case is to have main CPU do most of the work with FPGA&#x27;s accelerating it or handling interfaces (I/O) in a way they&#x27;re better at. I&#x27;d say Google on FPGA hobby projects, use cases, &quot;applications,&quot; etc to see the $3+ billion worth of uses for them.

Add 1.7 million LUTS for custom logic w/ 138 Mbits of registers or cache... noting that one of those mighty Oracle SPARC T1 processors only needs about 400,000 LUTS... to get a beast of a machine.

If you don’t really know the founding team of an early stage startup and don’t have experience, it’s tough to assess the risk regarding the team, the product, and the market.  If they’re hiring you out of college, they may be looking for cheap labor.  A mid to late stage startup likely has product and market solved, and is focused on growth.  You will still have an impact, likely learn from top notch people, and see what success looks like.  Then you can move smaller or bigger as you choose depending upon what you want.",1437152819

An audience that is dedicated to the content you serve<p>2. The ability to focus on the niche provides you a greater library than broader competitors have<p>3. The ability to market yourself in such a way that you build reputation with the core audience<p>The end result is you can create a product that other people will pass up competing offerings for that might have broader appeal - or will simply subscribe to both.<p>Netflix used to be the go-to for Anime for a long period of time.

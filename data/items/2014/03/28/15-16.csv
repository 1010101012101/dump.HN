7488021,comment,7485673,7486015,2,0,aestra,,,">And for all the people bitching about how AA is religious -- it&#x27;s not! The &quot;higher power&quot; thing is more of a philosophy than a religion.<p>Bull-fucking-shit.<p>I&#x27;ve read the AA &quot;big book&quot; (enough of it that I could stand). It is a religious book. The part about non-believers is especially offensive - to me. It quotes from the Bible, it explicitly refers to the Judeo-Christian God. Many court have ruled people can&#x27;t be forced to attend AA meetings because it violates the first amendment&#x27;s freedom of religion clause.[1] If it wasn&#x27;t religious organization, then it wouldn&#x27;t.<p>AA can actively harmful - <i>to some people.</i> This whole &quot;go to AA if you have an addition as a first step for everyone&quot; is complete and total nonsense.<p>If people seek AA, struggle with the concept of a higher power, you know GOD, they might think they can&#x27;t get better. If you are religious, seek AA, if you are not, don&#x27;t. I disagree completely that AA is a universal treatment. It is not.<p>As I said before - I know an addict, he avoids getting help because he believes that the 12 step programs are offensive. (I share the same opinion - however I acknowledge they work for some people and that&#x27;s good - I just disagree they should be the &quot;go to&quot; programs for everyone) He knows AA doesn&#x27;t work for him, but he doesn&#x27;t know there are non-religious programs and people who have gotten better without religion.<p>Preaching AA as a first step or a cure all is harmful to these people.<p>Do I have personal experience with addition - absolutely. I was never an addict, but I grew up all my life with an addict parent.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous#United_States_Court_rulings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous#United_Sta...</a><p>United States courts have ruled that inmates, parolees, and probationers cannot be ordered to attend AA. Though AA itself was not deemed a religion, it was ruled that it contained enough religious components (variously described in Griffin v. Coughlin below as, inter alia, &quot;religion&quot;, &quot;religious activity&quot;, &quot;religious exercise&quot;) to make coerced attendance at AA meetings a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the constitution.[88][89] In September 2007, United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stated that a parole office can be sued for ordering a parolee to attend AA.[90][91]",1396022387

It&#x27;s not possible to bring dead people back to life, so people who are not alive, but not 100% dead beyond the point of no return, still have a chance to be alive again.<p>Basically there are two meanings of dead: &quot;no neural activity&quot; and &quot;irreparable damage to the brain&quot;, if there is simply no neural activity but the brain is still physically intact, then you&#x27;re in a pseudo-dead state.",1396022223
7487999,comment,7485517,7486844,2,0,rprospero,,,"Well, everyone will probably experience this kind of micromanagement once in their grad school career, but you won&#x27;t see it the whole time unless you have a truly bad advisor.  Some of it just comes from forcing the grad students to work hard for a while so that you learn to work smart.  A first year grad student will spend forty hours a week in the lab, pressing a button every ten minutes and recording count rates into a notebook.  She&#x27;ll get chewed out by her advisor for not spending enough time on research.  She&#x27;ll turn into a third year student who spends eight hours a week in the lab, pressing a button and recording count rates into a notebook.  By the time she&#x27;s a fifth year, she&#x27;ll have made a little machine to press the buttons and OCR the count rates for her.  That machine will run constantly  while the grad student spends just forty hours a week in the lab doing practical research.<p>The usual attitude I&#x27;ve seen is: I don&#x27;t care how much or how little time you spend in the lab, as long as you get the job done on time.  Granted, &quot;the job&quot; may be winding twenty solenoids, each of which takes eight hours to wind, and &quot;on time&quot;, may be seven days from now.  Similarly, your advisor probably won&#x27;t care if you take weekends off, but the calculation he asked you about at six on Friday still needs to be done monday morning.

There is no comparison to walking or biking, especially to work. As I said above, the effect is astonishing.<p>If I&#x27;m walking or biking somewhere, especially anywhere work-related, it feels so damn good. If I know that in the past I&#x27;d have been doing it in a car, it feels twice as good. If I see lots of other people in cars trying to do the same thing, I have the moral problem of trying to control my schadenfreude.<p>The one exception I&#x27;d make for automated vehicles, but it&#x27;s only a partial exception, is trains. As someone once quoted on HN: &quot;Everybody hates buses and everybody loves trains.&quot; Trains don&#x27;t have the quality of walking or bicycling, but they have some other lesser quality that still feels pretty good.

If being careful enough one can support multiple OS-s with the same playbook (at least different Linux flavors) but it&#x27;s definitely quite some maintenance like different package names and conf file locations etc.<p>A playbook contains tasks like installing, removing packages, editing config files etc. The beauty of it is that if done correctly you can run the same playbook over and over again against the same computer and each task can be smart enough to know if it needs to be run or not. This makes updating your computer with the same or updated playbook very fast.<p>With Ubuntu it&#x27;s easy to get to the post-OS install, it&#x27;s more involved with Arch Linux. I would first create an Arch box with Vagrant using Virtualbox. And then create a playbook that works with that virtual Arch box. If the box and ansible playbook is good enough then \n<a href=""https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Moving_an_existing_install_into_(or_out_of)_a_virtual_machine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Moving_an_existing_inst...</a><p>At least in theory, I haven&#x27;t moved Arch between VM and a real host myself...

For each a free version exists, but no race to the bottom has occurred. Instead the free version provides students and hobbyists the ability to learn the tool, which provides employers a greater pool of applicants which have experience in it. It also provides startups a way to minimize their burn rate until after a mockup or even a MVP is validated.<p>Afterwards, in each case when the economics make sense businesses pay large amounts to buy additional premium version licensing, training, integration, and add-on tools.

This hasn&#x27;t been stated explicitly, but it is very clear if you read between the lines of their PR initiatives.<p>According to statements from the company, the media coverage after the fires last year caused a sharp decline in the rate of Model S reservations. It has since recovered, but after these events Tesla started viewing poor public perception as an existential threat. The reasoning is that new and unfamiliar technology (battery propulsion) is scrutinized very, very closely and held to a much higher standard than the status quo. This is evident from the ridiculous headlines every time a Model S is involved in a fire. (Garage fires, house fires from unrelated accidents and the two floorpan fires + the high-speed crash referenced in the article). Poor public perception equals lower sales to an already skeptical public, and perhaps the second demise of the electric car.<p>A different strategy than the one Tesla is pursuing, would be to <i>not</i> change anything and just repeat the (correct) message that their electric cars are statistically much less likely to catch fire than a gasoline automobile. But this leaves them wide-open to PR attacks from skeptics and the established auto industry the next time an inevitable fire occurs. It&#x27;s already been firmly established that there is a big PR machinery which will jump on any opportunity to call Tesla&#x27;s technology into question - and there will be plenty of competition from the incumbent manufacturers.

If they are all are looking through the same lens, their lines of sight will all cross one another at the optical center of the lens, and so will be at an angle to one another. Therefore, each sensor has a different view of the surface - it is an example of parallax.<p>(EDIT: I have changed &#x27;lens system&#x27; to &#x27;lens&#x27;, because I think the former might be misleading. All I meant by &#x27;lens system&#x27; is that to make a decent camera, you have to have several lens elements along the optical axis. Subsequently, I realized &#x27;lens system&#x27; might be taken as implying an array  of lenses. What I actually mean by &#x27;lens&#x27; is simply as in &#x27;telephoto lens&#x27;.)<p>did a quick BOE calculation based on this assumption. The idea was to see if the implied focal length for the lens is plausible.<p>I actually used the green-blue pair for the calculation, because I think it is slightly more likely that each pair share a lens, than that they all do.<p>The green and blue images seem to be something more than a wingspan apart. We don&#x27;t know what type of aircraft these are, so I picked a 737 as a mid-sized example. The latest models have a 34m wingspan, so let&#x27;s say the aircraft has moved about 50m between images.<p>Assuming the aircraft are moving relatively slowly, because they are searching, I used 100 m/s (200kts) for their speed, which means there is 0.5 sec between the images.<p>The satellite is moving at &quot;almost 5 miles per sec&quot;, so let&#x27;s say 7 km/sec. That means the views of the two sensor arrays have a 3.5 km separation at the surface.<p>Zizzer gives the satellite altitude as about 630 km. The ratio of the focal length of the lens to the separation of the sensor arrays is the same as the ratio of the altitude of the satellite to the distance between what part of the surface each array is imaging: f/a = 630/3.5, or f = 180a (a is the array separation).<p>From the picture of the sensors, and principally using the connectors&#x27; pin-holes for a sense of scale, I guess the blue and green arrays are about 0.5 cm apart, implying f = 90cm, which seems plausible to me.",1396019032

AFAIK, it&#x27;s very much a genetic matter: some people (or, of note, peoples) just lack the genes needed to process it in a manageable manner, tend to feel the effects with greater intensity than others, and thus find it much faster to go too far and harder to get out of that state and not go back. Those who have it can enjoy a few without further compulsions; those who don&#x27;t dare not a drop. All this, of course, is poorly expressed and based on fragments I&#x27;ve gleaned. Anyone have a better analysis, and perhaps a way to test for this genetic predisposition to alcohol tolerance or lack thereof?",1396018968

If careful on the spending side of the equation we can make it with me working about 12 to 16 hours a week.<p>Secondly, I have built a technology-platform to enable me to deliver premium structured services very efficiently. But now that I have done most of the technology build I am into trying to build the business connections. I have more trouble disciplining myself to do the sales and marketing tasks that this phase requires.  And, even when I succeed at disciplining myself there is rarely the immediate feedback that you have been productive. With coding the feedback that says &quot;productive&quot; is almost immediate. At the end of the day I can point to a new feature that I created and tested and rest easy knowing that I have been productive.<p>With enterprise sales there are so many lags between what I do and the results. And, it is also a number game. Even if I am ultimately successful, I may well have faced 40 or 50  or even 100 rejections before the big break.  While in the middle of a string of rejections, it feels more like &quot;foolishness&quot; than &quot;productivity.&quot;<p>I like reading and learning like you mention.

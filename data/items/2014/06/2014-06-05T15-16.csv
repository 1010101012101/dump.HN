Who&#x27;s up for doing RCS?<p>Come to think of it, as the initial series of commits are linear, they could be specified in some linear fashion (yml maybe) -- and then replayed to create the initial &quot;broken&quot; state -- then one would only have to document the &quot;fixing&quot; part for different systems... Another alternative would be to convert (eg via mercurials git/svn plugins -- but I don&#x27;t think they cover bzr, monotone and rcs...).<p>[1] <a href=""http://selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial/2011-December/041164.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial/2011-December/041164....</a>",1401983976

I wish I had a downvote.<p>Second, he seems to be saying Snowden is a traitor because his revelations are hurting the US tech industry.  I can see why that would make Andreessen feel betrayed, but that is hardly the definition of traitor.<p>Third, as others have said, nobody was surprised the NSA is spying.  We&#x27;re surprised it is conducting pervasive electronic surveillance in the US.  (Personally, I&#x27;m horrified although not surprised by the scope of the spying outside the US.  I would strongly support extending privacy protections to everyone, as unrealistic as that idea is.)<p>Finally, if we&#x27;re going to get definitional, Snowden is certainly a traitor.  He clearly broke the law, betrayed the trust placed in him and it seems very likely he would be convicted of treason.  However, I also think he did the right thing for the right reasons.",1401983945

7852545,comment,7850849,7851804,1,0,jmclean,,,"I do! I have some sketches that I drew up a while back. It&#x27;s sort of a loose collection of thoughts, though this is inspiring me to think about it with more rigor :)<p>I imagine it as a combination of an abstraction layer on top of processing and a light IDE. Something like a palette of shapes and objects similar to what&#x27;s available in photoshop and illustrator. Instead of drawing shapes, though, it would create code snippets for the various objects.<p>Those objects would be available to modify in an event loop similar to Processing (or Arduino, for that matter). With a strong autocomplete for both object names and the available manipulations for those objects, I feel like you could learn just by playing around.<p>Live preview like Swift /light table etc would be really powerful. Out of the box support for common things like collision detection would be great too. Color pickers that spit out rgba values? Maybe. Basically a tool palette oriented around building code for visuals.<p>In terms of the language itself, it probably veers more into personal taste. I&#x27;d love to see names of things be less arcane /abbreviated. Dropping some of the brackets and parens would be nice for non programmers too. (Again, taste.) Ruby-like syntax for new objects instead of objective-C-like constructors would be more readable. Basically, the more it could just resemble an English description of what you want to happen, the better.<p>Processing isn&#x27;t that far away from this description, but the combination of having to refer to the documentation constantly, no sensible defaults, almost limitless customizability, and having to actually compile the sketch to run means that the initial barrier is really high. It&#x27;s very difficult to get into flow until you reach a high level of familiarity with the language.<p>I would <i>love</i> to chat about this further and share ideas with you or anyone who&#x27;s interested!",1401983779

7852536,comment,7851357,7852457,3,0,clarry,,,"I kind of understand what you want but right now you have to acknowledge the reality that LibreSSL is a part of OpenBSD, its core developers are core OpenBSD developers, its source resides in the OpenBSD source tree, you get it from the servers that serve you OpenBSD.  One is a part of the other.  You can&#x27;t really point at a fraction of the electricity bill and say that is for libssl.  Likewise you can&#x27;t say that a developer&#x27;s laptop must only be used for working on libssl.  And you can&#x27;t say $5 (or whatever you donated) worth of an OpenBSD developer&#x27;s time must go towards libssl and not something else.  You may find that with no OpenBSD, there would be no security-minded OpenBSD developers to work on /usr/src/lib/libssl.<p>If you want to deny the project its money and only contribute to a part of it, the only way I can see that happening right now is that you hire a developer to work on the part you want.<p>Also, don&#x27;t forget that developing software on OpenBSD is likely to make that software better (there are features that make OpenBSD a good development platform; and the fact that code is tested on many different hardware platforms helps).

Our ability to treat mental illness today is better than it was 75 years ago.<p>This isn&#x27;t a counter-argument. Lots of things that were science fiction 50 years ago are <i>still</i> science fiction today.<p>However, I will keep an open mind. If in the future someone claims to understand rehabilitation and can prove this, I will consider their work/theory. I will not &quot;just try it anyway&quot; today because of wishful thinking.<p>> Why not try to find ways that we can stop paying for people to be in prisons<p>Fine by me, as long as it doesn&#x27;t involve science fiction. I even have some suggestions:<p>Legalize drugs. Don&#x27;t decriminalize them. Don&#x27;t just legalize marijuana either... legalize cocaine, heroin, meth. Pardon everyone for their drug crimes (but not violent crimes associated with drug dealing).<p>Do this, and you can substantially reduce both the number of people in prison, and the average time spent there. Low level drug dealers won&#x27;t spend time in prison learning to be psychopaths. Drug users won&#x27;t commit burglaries and theft trying to pay for their drug habit (if they&#x27;ll do anything for a fix, anything includes scrubbing toilets).<p>Of course, this won&#x27;t happen. People believe the television shows they watch where someone who uses meth once turns into a demon.<p>> Something that was evidence based would surely work better.<p>I agree. But this is a problem I think requires a working theory of mind/intelligence. (Funny how it&#x27;s either another variation of the AI problem, or related to it, eh?) We don&#x27;t have that.<p>> But instead the focus in the US is on punishment<p>This is because we are monkeys. I don&#x27;t mean metaphorically, but literally. Monkeys have instinctual senses of justice that demand punishment and vengeance and so forth.<p>If you remove punishment from the equation, this would be bad. The state punishes so that the monkeys will feel as if justice has occurred, and will refrain from performing their own justice.<p>Do you want revenge killings and vigilanteeism to rise?",1401983282

On one hand, Amazon wants to keep prices low for customers, but don&#x27;t want to pay the subsidy from their pocket anymore. On the other hand, Hachette doesn&#x27;t want to pay part of that subsidy either, and they threaten the authors that if Amazon has its way they will have to get a smaller royalty (because they aren&#x27;t willing to lower their costs).<p>Amazon has a lot of power, and they could easily start abusing it either soon or in the future, but for now I think they are fighting in the interest of the customer. Hatchette on the other hand, is acting much like the big music studios - threatening that the authors/artists will be the ones to lose, and <i>not them</i>.<p>The truth is the publishers and big studios are becoming increasingly more threatened with extinction, and in the future there won&#x27;t be room for them to take the <i>majority</i> of revenue from a book. Either they adapt to take a much smaller cut, or they will go bankrupt.<p>That&#x27;s why I think Amazon is on the right side of history here. I also think Amazon is on the right side of history, because I don&#x27;t think most ebooks are worth $15, which is what most of these publishers want them to be at (going by the deal with Apple).<p>Either way, Amazon won&#x27;t be subsidizing their ebooks by $3+ forever. They will eventually raise the prices, and I don&#x27;t think that will be good for <i>anyone</i>. Not Amazon, not the authors, and not the publishers either, as there will be a lot fewer ebook sales. I think the $9.99 price point played a huge role in getting people to read e-books (remember when reading ebooks wasn&#x27;t anywhere close to the acceptable way of reading a book?).<p>What&#x27;s the ideal scenario here? It&#x27;s for ebooks to remain $9.99 (or less) and for Amazon to end the subsidies (which would make things easier for their competitors), which of course means the publishers will have to take that $3 cut themselves (I don&#x27;t think the authors should take any cut, as they already get pretty low royalties from the big publishers).

The way I understood it, most OpenBSD developers are not for hire, not in a manner like this anyhow.  These people work on the things they want to work on, and they share the result of their work as a gift to the world.  Donations are a gift in return, and the funding enables them to hack more (i.e. hackathons, hardware for developers who need it, infra, etc.) and to share the result with the rest of us (servers & infra).<p>Can you imagine someone saying &quot;I want to give you this gift but only if you focus on thing X (which I care about) and not on things Y and Z (which you care about)&quot;?<p>Keep in mind that the BSDs strive to be a complete, integrated operating system.  While some devs focus on small parts of the tree, many or most work on the larger whole.  Improvements to specific parts are a part of improvements to the whole.  Working on LibreSSL is a byproduct or <i>part of</i> working on OpenBSD.<p><i>Can you buy a faster server and more bandwidth to serve this one subdirectory in your project?  But don&#x27;t spend that money on anything else?</i><p>EDIT: Having said that, developers are and have been funded to work on specific things.. IIRC the kms work was sponsored, and gilles works on smtpd as a part of his job.  But I think it would be kind of rude to disregard the effort the core OpenBSD devs have spent on LibreSSL and only donate if you can give that money to one or two paid developers.  Look at it this way: Theo works on many many parts of the system.  So does Miod.  And so does Bob.  As do many other developers who commit changes to LibreSSL.  They&#x27;re in it for OpenBSD.  Can you tell them to forget OpenBSD and do LibreSSL for you?<p>EDIT: Or how about this?  <i>Sorry guys, this hackathon we&#x27;re allowed to touch libssl only.  Why?  Because some people &quot;donated&quot; for us to work on LibreSSL and LibreSSL only.</i>  I don&#x27;t think it can go like that.  It becames work for money.

What I have is a bit of a view into just how far down the road we are on the engineering tradeoffs already.<p>Small and light cars aren&#x27;t a miracle cure anyhow. It&#x27;s amazing how small the gains are from shrinking a car. Yes, there are gains, but we&#x27;re not talking taking a 40mpg sedan (in routine manufacturing now, BTW) and turning it into an 80mpg sedan &quot;just by shrinking it a bit&quot;. You might get it down to 50mpg, but, per other articles observing that &quot;mpg&quot; is the wrong way to view it and &quot;gallons per mile&quot; starts making more sense, a 40 to 50 mpg gain is not actually <i>that</i> large.<p>No, the environment can&#x27;t be saved just by &quot;making cars smaller&quot;. You don&#x27;t win anywhere near as much as you think, because of the way drag works (it&#x27;s nonlinear in speed). And you can&#x27;t just start taking panels off and stripping out airbags.<p>From what I gather, having trimmed just about everything they can from the spare tire, they&#x27;re on the verge of dropping it off entirely. That&#x27;s the level of optimization we&#x27;re down to. There isn&#x27;t much left after that. The seats are what they are due to safety regulations. The airbags are there because of safety regulations. The bumpers are there due to safety regulations. The body panels are what they are due to safety regulations and the need to survive a certain number of years out in the elements. There&#x27;s just not much freedom in car design anymore.<p>My family doesn&#x27;t include designers in them, but they relayed the designer&#x27;s complaints to me that the constraints are becoming so strong that it&#x27;s becoming very difficult to differentiate between cars anymore. If it feels like they all look the same lately, excepting perhaps the exact location or shape of the lights, it&#x27;s because they do look the same; the combination of safety and efficiency regulations is rapidly converging down to one solution for a given form factor. Again... this is the sign of an optimization process reaching its Pareto frontier, and that you can&#x27;t get big gains anymore without big sacrifices somewhere else.<p>You can look out in the world and see that last bit of evidence yourself, without anyone in the automotive industry. It&#x27;s the same systems optimization problem faced by any engineer, even programmers.",1401981440

Paradoxically, I think it requires a top-down commitment. Companies usually want to try this sort of thing incrementally. So they put their best people into an R&D group that has a fair amount of autonomy. However, over time what seems to happen is that it&#x27;s resented and attacked, and eventually has to spend more time fighting political battles than innovating. At that point, it&#x27;s often just as underperforming as the rest of the organization, the experiment is judged a failure, and that autonomy is taken away.

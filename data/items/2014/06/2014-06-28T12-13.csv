7958077,comment,7957422,7957422,1,0,drorh,,,"Unfortunately, when Israel pulled out of Gaza and let its people decide their future, the first thing they did was to crash the agricultural infrastructure Israel left (such as greenhouses) and the next was to elect Hamas to rule them, who proceed immediately to building military infrastructure (factories to produce missiles, underground tunnels and weapon caches, smuggling tunnels one could pass a vehicle through to enhance terrorist and Iranian missiles to the Gaza strip). No wonder then that not too long later, Israel was forced to place a blockade to prevent or even slow down the military buildup. Later mini-wars following missiles attacks from Gaza towards Israeli cities clearly showed why the blockade was needed.<p>Had the Palestinians had a smarter leadership who had some sense in their heads, they would have put the huge amounts of money used for militarization (and corruption, as the EU has determined) to buildng better life for their citizens. Israel had all the incentives to help them had they for once got some sense. However, it is apparently too much to expect - see what is going all over the middle east (and other places like Nigeria) and you can tell that violence is endemic in the Arab/Muslim culture and until they won&#x27;t evolve past this cultural disability, the people will continue to suffer, in Gaza, in Egypt, in Libia, in Nigeria, in Iran, in Syria, in Iraq, in Pakistan, ... (the list goes on)",1403960358

7958072,comment,7956627,7957715,3,0,DasIch,,,"As a student of the TU Berlin myself, I feel that this has to be taken with a large grain of salt. In the first semester you learn one functional programming language, after that it&#x27;s Java, C and MIPS Assembler.<p>The functional programming language is Opal, a language developed at the TU Berlin, it has barely any documentation, a compiler that only works on Linux and OS X, that is if it works because it has quite a few bugs, it further comes with a REPL that sometimes produces failures the compiler doesn&#x27;t and tooling is non-existant.<p>So as a new CS student you have to learn using Linux and setup a development environment by yourself with barely any documentation to go on. You then continue learning only the very basics of programming such as what functions are, if statements, recursion, big O complexity, a little bit of parsing and though it&#x27;s called differently: monads. At the end of the semester you then develop a renderer for a regular subset of HTML that includes only <html>, <head>, <body>, <title> and <p style=&quot;text-align: {left, right, center, justify};&quot;>.<p>On top of that the language has a couple of weird features: Every function can be used as any kind of operator if the number of arguments fits. This means that the parser has often problems figuring out precedence rules and you end up adding parenthesis around every expression just to be on the safe side.<p>Number literals also don&#x27;t exist. There is a pre-defined set of functions which don&#x27;t take an argument and produce a number such a 1-12 or so, n^10 for a few n, and a couple of 2^n for a few n. All other numbers have to be explicitly converted from strings. In practice this means you do the latter all the time so 1 turns into (&quot;1&quot;!).<p>Furthermore variables are defined by name and type. You can have two variables called foo in the same scope, if they have a different type and depending on how foo is used (Opal has type inference) one of the variables is chosen.<p>The prior feature is effectively necessary because Opal also doesn&#x27;t have polymorphic functions. It has polymorphic &quot;Structures&quot;. A Structure is file you can import, within that file you can define a set of variables that are polymorphic, the types of which are defined by however is importing it either explicitly or implicitly through type inference.<p>This is pretty much like how you might use the pre-processor in C to achieve polymorphism.<p>Have I mentioned by the way that a Structure is actually just a header like in C? In the Structure you only define the types of the API, the implementation is in a different file.<p>So a functions like map requires writing two separate files. Luckily it&#x27;s in the stdlib.<p>Overall these features are fine, if everything works nicely but if you have an error somewhere, the compiler can emit massive difficult to understand errors, not unlike what a C++ compiler might produce for code that uses templates heavily.<p>The language and the choice to use that language is heavily critized by pretty much all students, functional programming however is not. In fact pretty much everyone would prefer if Haskell (which is the functional programming language closest to Opal) were used. The only reason it&#x27;s not, is that the current prof for that class lead the team who developed the language.",1403960220

7958060,comment,7957564,7957986,4,0,notduncansmith,,,"Style and metaphor are integral parts of interaction design. When a user clicks a button to dismiss a dialog, what should happen?<p>If the experience you&#x27;re trying to create (in line with the brand) is more playful, then maybe the modal should bounce out of view.  If it&#x27;s a very serious corporate app that people are just using because they have to, then the modal should either quickly fade, or just immediately disappear.  One would be inclined to call this &quot;style&quot;.<p>What about when a user is asked to input a date and time?  There are two visual metaphors that come to mind: a calendar and a clock. The interaction designer has a few choices here.  Date + number picker, date + clock (cool metaphor for selecting a time, but a non-standard UI pattern that could confuse people).  This is an interaction design problem, not a visual design problem.<p>Perhaps you&#x27;re referring to style and metaphor as the color of buttons and the background texture of panels.  That I would say generally falls more into the realm of visual design; however, colors of buttons convey different semantic information, which affects how people <i>interact</i> with your app.",1403959826

They didn&#x27;t check for insurance status. That could be cause enough. Plus between you and the driver there exists no business relationship. So you can argue that there&#x27;s nothing to sue about.<p>Besides who would you sue ? &quot;The driver&quot; doesn&#x27;t work too wel. You&#x27;d sue Uber to get the name of the driver in the first place.<p>This go-between-suit is pretty common in legal cases. What should happen is this. Judge agrees Uber owes your medical bills/restitution/whatever applies. Judge also agrees that Uber can get this amount from their driver. Then Uber has to cough up the money, but if they ask for delay in payment until their suit of the driver is finished, 99% certain they&#x27;ll get that. Then you get the choice of getting the money from Uber, or joining Uber&#x27;s suit against the driver (not a hard choice with Uber).",1403958143

You know, so that you can actually prove your node was part of the tree. Just having the root is not enough.<p>Where is the full tree being built, stored, how is it shared, how do I get a copy of it, so that I can find my node in it? If the tree is built from collective inputs, what are the anti-DDoS mechanisms? Etc...<p>Peers would need to share this data structure for some amount of time after the block is published (not indefinitely). Anyone who thinks their hash is part of certain block&#x27;s tree would need to retrieve the full tree for that block, and if they find their node in the tree, keep their own record of the log(n) hashes required to get from their node to root. It&#x27;s a big trade-off to impose this external data storage requirement!<p>All these questions / complexity, and what is the actual benefit?

7957999,comment,7956627,7957876,3,0,wz1000,,,"Python is an amazing language. I have been using it to do all my automation and scripting work for a long time. However, Python programs almost always feel like they were held together with string.<p>I recently have been putting a lot of time into learning Haskell and it is amazing. The type system gives me so much confidence, and I have now reached a stage where writing Haskell programs is as concise and fast as writing Python programs, with a lot less bugs and a lot more extensiblity. The thing is that defaults matter. With Python, sure you can achieve a lot of this stability by using a lot of assertions, but who want&#x27;s to do all that work to write a simple script. With Python, I used to have write once code that I would use for a task and chuck away. With Haskell and its abstractions, I reuse almost all of my code. I have completely replaced Python with Haskell as the programming language I use to do my daily work.<p>Sure, Haskell is very different from conventional programming languages and initially hard to learn since we all just want to change state. However, personally this style was surprisingly easy to internalize. Instead of modifing data, you are passing it through a series of pipes, transformers and filters to get your final result. It is very easy to reason this kind of code, though with laziness, Haskell makes it hard to reason about its exact performance.<p>> <i>Really? For one, what all &quot;FP languages&quot; do when they run, is &quot;flip individual switches and modify memory&quot;. The way they model the program is just an abstraction (and a leaky one) from what happens in the machine.</i><p>Well, all Python programs manage pointers in the end, and flip individual switches and modify memory, so functions and objects and all of that jazz are just leaky abstractions. We should all go back to assembly, or even better, flipping switches.<p>I believe the IO Monad to be a wonderful abstraction for what happens inside the machine. Monads are wonderful abstractions in general, and first learning how <i>normal</i> monads like the list, State and Maybe monads work is an amazing experience, but realizing how IO is just a special case of the State monad is mind blowing.<p>> <i>Second, I thought the Church-Turing thesis shows that lambda calculus is equivalent to the Turing machine way, for one.</i><p>Yes they are equivalent just as Brainfuck is equivalent to Python, or C to Java, or Fortran to Smalltalk. These are all Turing Complete languages, so obviously they are equivalent!<p>> <i>And if Algol was good enough for Dijkstra, modern, 10-times better algol derivatives are good enough for me. Especially if they also have adopted tons of functional paradigms, which you can get to opt to use when it makes sense for your design, and not have them forced upon you.</i><p>If assembly was good enough for Knuth, why are we not using that? x86 is good enough for me. Why are Algol derivatives forcing me to use the imperative style of code? Why can&#x27;t I use a modern functional language and and use imperative, unsafe, statefull code when it makes sense for my design?<p>The problem is that defaults matter, and separating unsafe and safe code has a lot of advantages. Also, IMHO functional code is just easier to read and much cleaner. Instead of writing step by step instructions to the computer, we tell it what to do in a more declarative manner, because the lower abstractions can easily be separated out.

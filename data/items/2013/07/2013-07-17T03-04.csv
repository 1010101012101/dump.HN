6056028,comment,6054935,6055865,2,0,rayiner,,,"&quot;Unfair competition&quot; is a term of art for a class of torts. The term arose because certain business practices were historically seen as underhanded or unfair. These days we&#x27;d talk instead in terms of market failures or inefficiencies. E.g. the torts of &quot;passing off&quot; or &quot;trade libel&quot; decrease economic efficiency by sewing misinformation in the market. Copying capital-intensive R&D implicates the free rider effect, and thus a tort aimed at keeping companies from copying technology instead of inventing their own would fall under the umbrella of of unfair competition.<p>Circling back, it&#x27;s not &quot;unfair&quot; that product companies have natural advantages in the market. Arguably, it&#x27;s not desirable for product companies to be able to further leverage their advantage by being able to copy designs and technologies from other companies. That let&#x27;s them compete &quot;unfairly&quot; by letting someone else take the expense and risk of doing research then undercutting them by getting the results of the research for free. I think it&#x27;s a good thing to have companies like ARM that focus on creating designs, but without some sorts of protections, companies like Samsung that focus on manufacturing and end-user products would be able to steamroll over those companies by copying their designs.",1374033526

It doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to sell for less than $25 based on expected volumes though.<p>Based on initial impressions I&#x27;ll agree the book isn&#x27;t giving off the vibe that it&#x27;s worth much more than 1-2 coffees of value ($5-$10), but after looking into it a bit more there&#x27;s no reason why it can&#x27;t improve that (it is after all a decent length book by a previously published author who has relevant experience, so $25 sounds quite reasonable).<p>1. Better site design would make me more confident the book is well designed.<p>2. Include chapters in the same format/design as the book (rather than just HTML pages).<p>3. Tell me front and center that the book is 197 pages (that&#x27;s quite a lot!). First impression I thought this was a couple of blog posts worth of generic advice, not a decent length book.<p>4. Make the links to the successful blog posts that spawned the book more prominent (bonus: site adds credibility).<p>5. Make it easier on scanning that he&#x27;s already an accomplished well-reviewed author (Build Awesome Command-Line Applications in Ruby). Include reviews from here initially in the context of showing author credibility (need to make it clear they&#x27;re not for the current book though obviously).<p>6. Highlight the experience in an easier to skim way<p>7. Make the book cover look different, e.g. 3D rotate with imaginary book pages, or border, or on a darker background or something (the white edges for me at least didn&#x27;t look like part of the book, so I see the slim narrow purple band and think &quot;booklet&quot; not book).<p>For reference, Nathan Barry does some of the best sales pages I&#x27;ve seen (Patrick McKenzie aka patio11 happens to agree).<p>Nathan&#x27;s advice:<p><a href=""http://nathanbarry.com/learned-selling-6000-ebook-today/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nathanbarry.com/learned-selling-6000-ebook-today/</a><p><a href=""http://nathanbarry.com/step-by-step-landing-page-copywriting/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nathanbarry.com/step-by-step-landing-page-copywriting...</a><p>Samples:<p><a href=""http://nathanbarry.com/webapps/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nathanbarry.com/webapps/</a><p><a href=""http://nathanbarry.com/app-design-handbook/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nathanbarry.com/app-design-handbook/</a>",1374033111

6056007,comment,6053897,6053897,1,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"A couple weekends ago, I drove with my two young children to a restaurant 20 minutes from our house only to learn that it, a mom-n-pop operation, was closed for a couple of weeks.  I suppose I could have called ahead to confirm my presumption that they were open, but I didn&#x27;t learn about this &quot;planned outage&quot; until I saw the 8.5 x 11 sign on the door.  Apparently, they closed for a family vacation.<p>It would be cool to have some sort of proactive notification when the many assumptions I make about the world around me become incorrect.  Take a person&#x27;s work commute as an example.  Presumptions include road availability, public transit timeliness, lack of major events causing traffic delays, sufficient fuel in one&#x27;s vehicle, the line at Starbucks being reasonable, no horrible weather forecast which would require bringing an umbrella along, etc.  Imagine an app which invoked a bunch of figurative assert statements on the presumptions we make daily in life.<p>I&#x27;m posting this here simply because it entered my stream of consciousness when I saw the headline.  At first, I thought that &quot;real world&quot; status is un-related to the problem StatusPage solves.  However, sending notifications to customers upon an outage is a step closer to my handwaving above.  Take as an example the availability of employee VPN access.  How many times have you gone home early presuming that you would be able to work later in the evening and later realized that you can&#x27;t kick off that build, etc.  While learning that the VPN server is down doesn&#x27;t help you do your work, you probably are more likely to find that your co-worker is still at the office at 7:00 PM than three hours later.  Maybe you would have been lucky enough to learn about the outage before you left the office.<p>One problem I see is that being alerted about every presumption violation would be annoying.  I&#x27;d like to infer intent somehow.  &quot;I&#x27;m going to work today&quot; implies a lot about what&#x27;s important for me to know.  Being informed about &quot;outages&quot; certainly would be an incentive to put a zillion things on my calendar.  What if you were planning to see a band at a bar next Thursday, and adding the event to your calendar somehow allowed proactive notification in case of cancellation?<p>We take it as a given that life will surprise us with disappointments, but this condition might only be the result of historically high costs of sending and receiving notifications.  Does anyone remember phone trees?  Watching the TV to learn of school closings?  Making detailed logistical plans about how to meet-up with friends (along with various contingencies) in the days before mobile phones?  Technology replaced these annoyances, and there&#x27;s no reason to believe all progress has been made.  I want the absence of notifications to imply that life will abide by my presumptions.",1374033061

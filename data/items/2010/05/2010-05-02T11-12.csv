It is really, really achievable if folks are looking for what you have.  All you need is solid meat-and-potatoes onpage optimization (title tags, effective keyword use, all that jazz), minimal linkbuilding (ask friends to link to you from their blogs or do Peldi's thing), and (the one I frequently find missing on new software sites) sufficient content to get search hits for.  You don't want to try for SEO using the typical five-pages-with-150-words-max that most folks use as their starter site.<p>This is a compelling reason to put your site up prior to launching, by the way.  Heck, put it up before you even have a product coded.  (My next one is up already and getting a wee little trickle of traffic with just a few paragraphs and a link to a Wufoo form for folks who want to join the beta after I, you know, get around to writing it.)",1272800380

There are things that people will post ""publicly"" on Facebook that they would  never dream of making a separate website for to post publicly.

It's funny though, occasionally at a very official place I've had a staff member say my real signature that matches all my ID is too messy and ask me to write down my name beneath it in print. That happened to me at at least one or two consulates over the last few years when applying for visas.<p>Also, I remember one time a friend got a 250 euro ticket driving through Austria, and I thought it was nonsense. He was speeding sure, but I think they inflated it by more than it was, and they said he had to pay on the spot or they wouldn't let him go. If I was in that spot, I think I'd write ""Coerced Void"" in artful cursive on the receipt and protest it later with the credit card company.",1272799216

It forces you to keep some weight on your legs, like the perching mentioned in the article.  But it has an additional benefit:  you can't help but bounce a little bit.  You're body's not designed to remain static for long.  Overall, I feel less lethargic and less prone to neck and shoulder pain.<p>Most people have weak core muscles due to chairs with backs, so if you're going to try out this kind of chair, don't be surprised if you can't do it for more than an hour a day at first.  Also, it may not be a good idea if you're tall, since the ball can only inflate so much.  If the angle between your upper legs and your body isn't greater than 90 degrees it probably won't work for you.<p>I still have a normal chair.  If you're working crazy hours, you need to give your supporting muscles a break sometimes.<p>Oh, and it's really cheap: mine was about $60 if I convert from my local currency.<p>EDIT: here's an example, but don't buy it online if you haven't tried it:

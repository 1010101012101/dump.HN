My advice - don&#x27;t worry about the next big thing too much, it will become clear if you keep your eyes open. Avoid jumping on brand new bandwagons which might be going nowhere, but at the same time if something is clearly gaining momentum, get into it in your spare time.<p>For example I cut my OO teeth on Smalltalk in the 90s, but Java looked fun, so some colleagues an I built game applets in our spare time. I moved straight into a serious commercial Java job. I also played a little with Flash actionscript- got me nowhere, but fun nonetheless.<p>Javascript is a good thing thing to have in your kit bag today.<p>But to stay relevant for the next 42 years, learn how to learn.",1392033452

The distro ecosystem has been moving towards the other half of Sutherland&#x27;s wheel of reincarnation - in this case, from modular systems towards monolithic ones. First it was stuff in the desktop space - now it&#x27;s creeping into other areas.<p>You can state the particular point of inflection as a terrible thing, or a good thing, but seen as a technology learning cycle, it becomes _necessary_ even if the implementation chosen is shit and you hate everything about it. At the other end of it, it still gets broken up again into a different set of modular components whose design wouldn&#x27;t have been apparent at the beginning.<p>Since the initial discussion stage is over, I would say, if you really think this is the wrong solution(and I don&#x27;t consider myself expert enough on inits to cast much judgment here), your work is best spent on the code environment immediately surrounding systemd - not direct competitors, but stuff that it has to deal with at some point.

Then the compiler has to generate one when needed.<p>Adding two N-bit numbers produces N+1-bit result, and C gives you no direct means of accessing the full result. IMO, this is a language defect and has little to do with HW support. [This pertains also to multiplication: NxN bits -> 2N-bit result.]<p>If the hardware actually returns the full result, excellent; if no, the compiler has to synthesize code to compute it, <i>if needed</i>. Whether it&#x27;s needed is inferrable by the code that follows, e.g., the type of the variable the result is assigned to.<p>IMO, inferring that only a partial result is used (e.g., carry is discarded) is much easier for the optimizer than inferring what some instruction sequence is supposed to do. (E.g., 4+ multiplications and few additions => single 32x32=>64 multiply.)",1392033110

Those reasons where not for technical issues, so a better gold will not convince countries to switch to bitcoin on their own.<p>It is a bit of a chicken-egg problem, bitcoin needs to rise in popularity a lot before that happens. From a consumer point of view, there is no benefit to use bitcoin over using his VISA card. So the push will need to come from somewhere else.<p>I fail to see any killer benefit in Bitcoin that would put Bitcoin as the main world currency.

Go back to the moment you bought the Bitcoin. You apparently thought they were worth $1000 per Bitcoin at that moment, there is nothing wrong with that.<p>That you invested in Bitcoin means you expected them to rise, do you remember how much you expected them to rise? In what timespan? Does the price going down for now affect that estimation? In what way? Why would you sell your Bitcoin?<p>There&#x27;s answers to all those questions that go in every direction, but they lie in the future, so the only thing you can do is make a reasonable prediction, and hope it was realistic enough.<p>Some people think Bitcoin will go to $10k, some people think Bitcoin will prove useless and die out. Decide in which camp you are.<p>About MtGox: If MtGox would somehow mess up bad enough that your money/btc is not safe there, that would hit the BTC so bad that its value would at least half, if not more, at <i>every</i> exchange.

In the best (cheapest) case, this will cost the same as 12 hours of minimum wage per day, as nurses might be in a 1:1 or 1:2 ratio with patients.  More realistically, the nurse will be making higher than minimum wage.<p>The NICU fee also covers the amortized cost of three major pieces of capital: the ventilator, which causes the baby to breathe, the incubator, which keeps it at an appropriate temperature, and the negative pressure room.  A particular infant may or may not need the negative pressure room, but it exists as a (physically separate) part of the NICU, the hospital must have one, and it&#x27;s hugely expensive to create.<p>Additionally, the baby is expected to suffer various bodily failures which will require treatment.  Diagnosis and treatment of these will be charged separately; they are not covered in the NICU fee.  But they do reflect that these babies would really rather die, and it&#x27;s difficult and expensive to get them to live.<p>My mother says (paraphrased), &quot;if you are the army, you buy all the machines yourself, you pay everyone army salaries, and you just assign them &#x27;you&#x27;ll do this job, you&#x27;ll do this job&#x27;, etc., I don&#x27;t know what it would cost to run an NICU.

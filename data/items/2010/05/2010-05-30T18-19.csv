The article focused on that side of Facebook -- the teen angst, grass-is-always-greener, add ""friends"" to get ahead in FarmVille side.<p>When Facebook is used as a tool to support existing friendships, it can be very, very good.  It's helped me stay informed of what my family is up to, reconnect with some old friends, and organize various social events.  The article completely missed that side of Facebook.<p>To those whose experience matches the first paragraph, the problem isn't the tool, it's the users.

There's basically three options when storing a tree in a relational database - adjacency lists which are slow to read, nested sets which are slow for writes, and materialized path, which is slow for moving around nodes.

In a best-case scenario, a just-in-time compiler has profiling information available that a static compiler won't have. In the right situations, Java JIT can produce performance on par with or slightly exceeding that of equivalent C code for this very reason.",1275243095
1390864,comment,1390599,1390829,0,0,famfam,,,"I think the right answer is somewhere in the middle. I've worked at several companies that catered to every voice in the crowd, and the product gets pulled in a hundred directions. I have some semblance of a vision, and some of these ideas are antithetical to that vision. I think part of the reason that the UI is simple, is because of the minimalism and rejection of bells and whistles.<p>But you're right that I should not discount these things out of hand. I have a blank slate and it may be possible to incorporate the things that i think are relevant in a new and unobtrusive way. e.g. in a way that may only be visible to power users. For example, one feature request I <i>do</i> agree with is the idea of contexts, e.g. @work, @home, @school, etc. I think it makes perfect sense. I was thinking I could allow people to use @ tags in their task description (e.g. ""Mow the grass @home""), then in the ""give me something to do"" section add a ""at [dropdown]"" that only appears if they've entered location-sensitive tasks. That way, the feature only adds complexity IF you want to use it.<p>Great food for thought. Thanks.",1275243070

Then perhaps you can tell me some areas you consider deep math that you think are not used in economics and I&#x27;ll try to find places they are.<p>Kantorovich and Koopmans (Nobel Econ) claimed Dantzig (a very pure mathematician, invented simplex algorithm) deserved to share their Nobel Prize for linear programming - they were using cutting edge mathematics, right?<p>Calculus of variations, optimal control, dynamic programming - used extensively and many areas extended for economic questions (Ramsey, Hotelling). Lots of new math invented for these uses.<p>Von Neumann introduced functional analytic methods and topology in order to prove his generalization of Brouwer&#x27;s fixed-point theorem in order to prove existence of optimal equilibrium for his model of economic growth - that is a pure math result, and a nice one, developed for an economic problem. Any generalization of the current best generalization of Brouwer&#x27;s fixed point theorem is a very nice result. VonNeumann did a lot of other math work for his economic interests.<p>Nash similarly.<p>Smale of Field medal fame used Baire category theory and Sard&#x27;s lemma to establish a new method of obtaining general equilibria for economic questions. Do those count as deep?<p>Game theory has a host of methods from all over mathematics to prove new results, using new mathematical results derived solely to prove results in game theory. Grab a monograph and see if any of this is deep enough for you.<p>Econometrics uses all level of statistics to answer measurement questions. Again, the tools and new results are there.<p>I could go on, but now it&#x27;s your turn. What math is deeper by your definition than all the pieces already used/needed/invented for current use in economics?",1421589553

(AIX actually comes with utilities for maintaining /etc/inittab such as mkitab.)  So too is svscanboot in daemontools 0.75 and later.  Gerrit Pape is currently having problems with the Debian package for running runit, precisely because runit has for some years been run from /etc/inittab in some configurations and in Debian 8 it is suddenly no longer a file whose existence is always guaranteed because it is part of an &quot;essential&quot; package.  There are some other packages in Debian 7 that have <i>undocumented</i> dependencies from the existence of an /etc/inittab file, because they too read/write it for their own purposes.  I have yet to verify whether they&#x27;ve been fixed for Debian 8.<p>Don&#x27;t think for one second that in the second decade of the 21st century people only ever use /etc/inittab for getty.  (-:<p>This is one of the quieter on-going problems for Debian 8.  It switches one to using systemd, because that&#x27;s the Debian 8 default; but there&#x27;s no upgrade path or compatibility mechanism for /etc/inittab.

Bernstein&#x27;s daemontools, Adam Sampson&#x27;s freedt, and Bruce Guenter&#x27;s daemontools-encore do not, strictly speaking (and pace Paul Jarc&#x27;s patches), have a program for running as process #1.  They all have &quot;svscanboot&quot;, which is to be spawned <i>by</i> process #1 and which runs &quot;svscan&quot; as a service manager.<p>Laurent Bercot&#x27;s s6 does not have a program for running as process #1.  Its &quot;s6-svscan&quot; is a service manager, usually run as some other process.  And its &quot;s6-svscanboot&quot; sample program is analogous to &quot;svscanboot&quot;.  It comes with examples for writing one&#x27;s own program to run as process #1, but &quot;s6 cannot provide live examples without becoming system-specific&quot; (<a href=""http://skarnet.org./software/s6/s6-svscan-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skarnet.org./software/s6/s6-svscan-1.html</a>).<p>Wayne Marshall&#x27;s perp has &quot;perpd&quot; as the service manager.

Only two in fact offer in-the-box replacements for System 5 init.  Do not conflate rc and init.  The person that you were replying to was wrong; hence the basis for your question was wrong.  Learn from &quot;system-manager&quot;&#x27;s manual page, &quot;runit&quot;&#x27;s manual page, what Paul Jarc found when he experimented with running svscan as process #1, and indeed &quot;systemd&quot;&#x27;s manual page to an extent.  &quot;init&#x27;s job&quot; is <i>more</i> than &quot;starting a process supervisor&quot;.",1421587361

It&#x27;s skilled, but it is not creative (though those passionate about darkrooms will likely disagree, but that&#x27;s their problem, the law is what it is). You could likely find thousands of people with the required skills and all of those would barring accidents come up with the exact same negatives as a result of the development process.<p>If you take a negative and you purposefully change it to reduce its fidelity then <i>that</i> might be a creative act. But if you do it to a negative that you did not expose you&#x27;re still going to end up (most likely, not 100%, this depends on the degree of modification) with a derivative work, the case you cite above has lots of changes rather than just a change in exposure or coloring or new photographic elements that weren&#x27;t present in the old image and hand drawn bits it has <i>all</i> of them. It&#x27;s clearly a mash-up of several elements of which the original photograph admittedly makes up a sizeable chunk but definitely not 100% of it.<p>Your &#x27;off-center snapshot&#x27; is a new photograph which deliberately changes the composition of the original and has a larger chance of being deemed original (a better example would be say a photograph of the inside of a museum gallery depicting a number of artworks at once).<p>But the copyright on a derivative work lies squarely with the holder of the original copyright.<p>In this case the images are as close to an accurate reproduction as you could get.<p>So, either the person that developed these images has taken images that were in the public domain, has within his rights made a website that displays these pictures but has in error (either deliberate or through a misunderstanding of the law) placed a copyright sign underneath them.<p><i>Or</i> the original photographer has those copyrights, which have been subsequently (presumably) passed on to his/her estate.<p>The latter is likely not the case since (1) this is an American photographer and (2) in those days copyright still needed to be registered afaik. But let&#x27;s for the sake of the argument assume that this is the case then they, not the person that made the website would hold the copyright.<p>So either way I don&#x27;t think that copyright notice is legitimate.<p>Say you lose an SD card with a bunch of pictures on it that does not automatically transfer the rights to those pictures to the finder or to anybody who subsequently buys that SD card from the person who found it. Copyright does not work that way, it flows from the act of creation.",1421587271

216669,comment,216425,216425,0,0,pavelludiq,,,"I live in a small town and the main industry here is coffee shops and that's the default summer job for the area. So my summers are usually boring. Its too hot to go outside(curs you SUV's), to boring to work and smoking pot isn't as cool as it was when i was 16 so im bored as hell. So i was thinking about starting a project on my own. The drawback is that there is no money in it, and being a bartender or a dish washer pays decently for the local standards. All of my friends are going to be studying(most of my friends are ambitious), or working this summer so i have only my pc and a few ideas.",1213353227

From what I can tell, IDLE listens on a fixed port on localhost in order to communicate with the actual Python interpreter, so starting multiple IDLEs may not work.<p>If you run multiple instances of just ""python"" from the shell (assuming UNIX), there is no problem.<p>GIL is not involved here, it only comes into play when you have multiple threads in a single process.<p>I don't use IDLE, but <a href=""http://mail.python.org/pipermail/patches/2006-July/020329.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mail.python.org/pipermail/patches/2006-July/020329.ht...</a> suggests there's some ""-n"" switch you can IDLE with that alleviates the problem somehow.",1213352552

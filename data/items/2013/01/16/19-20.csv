5068677,comment,5066813,5067992,1,0,frogpelt,,,"For socialism to work the nature of people has to change. The nature of people is to be greedy and keep what they ""want"" or think they ""need"", not just what they actually need. Socialism asks (and eventually commands) people to give up things they wouldn't otherwise give up for the good of others who don't have those things with the motivation being either A) it's for the good of everyone and ultimately B) you'll be breaking the law if you don't.<p>Capitalism on the other is based upon everyone desiring to make a profit and thereby providing their own wants/needs, with the wants/needs themselves being the motivation to do so. At first blush, it seems like everyone can't make a profit. Someone has to lose, right? But that thinking is incorrect.<p>In the words of Paul Graham himself: \n""What leads people astray here is the abstraction of money. Money is not wealth. It's just something we use to move wealth around. So although there may be, in certain specific moments (like your family, this month) a fixed amount of money available to trade with other people for things you want, there is not a fixed amount of wealth in the world. You can make more wealth. Wealth has been getting created and destroyed (but on balance, created) for all of human history.""<p>In other words, profits come many times from created wealth that didn't otherwise exist.<p>So, while I don't know what particular flaws of capitalism you were referring to, capitalism is inherently based upon freedom of the individual while socialism is inherently based upon lack of freedom for the individual.<p>I'll take 100% capitalism with all of its flaws, no question, over most any brand of socialism, including the one we have now in the US.",1358366159

In fact, I've spent the past 8 months or so thinking about that very issue.<p>Here's the problem as I see it, and feel free to debate with me:<p>Our digital worlds are a much more seductive reality than what we've got in the real world. Our minds simply weren't built to handle notifications everywhere, games which exploit our psychology, etc.<p>We need new tools to help manage our minds in this new frontier. Because we simply don't get these addictive notifications in reality. And for evidence that this digital world is more seductive, just look at how many people have their faces in their phones.<p>So what is the first step in helping us manage our minds more effectively? I researched all the data I could find, and it turned out meditation had the most potential.<p>So I turned to meditation and said how could I improve the experience? This is my first iteration at giving us tools to improve control of our minds. Its a very basic tool, and I'm very aware of the potential downfalls.<p>I'm willing to hear any advice you or anyone else has on the future of mind analysis with tracking devices.",1358366000

Not sure if your point is to dispute the OP or to whine about HN but to be safe I'll comment on both :-)<p>The OP is alarmed at the use of common privacy enhancing techniques (of which wearing a ski mask is one) which allows a prosecutor to 'enhance' the charges against someone to increase the threat level. They are also alarmed that non-technical people cannot see that changing your MAC address is just ""easy"" for a technical person to do as holding one hand over the other as you type in your PIN at the grocery store, and equally innocuous. Nobody disputes that 'changing your MAC address' should not be considered <i>as evidence</i> of intent when prosecuting a crime, but there is a lot of dispute as to whether that action in and of itself rises to the level a crime <i>in its own right</i>. This is what the OP fears will happen, and there is some evidence to support that.<p>That takes us to your second paragraph which talks about how painful it is for you when others express their emotions with respect to the events of the past weekend (and to be clear other events like it). Generally, yes, HN is a community of technologists and technology enthusiasts who discuss the merits or lack thereof of various technology trends, events, and personalities. That said, it is also a community of people. People can often discuss dispassionately about topics that are at arms length, but the weekend case struck close to home for noticeable fraction of the hundreds of thousands of people who visit this community. They need time to process these events, and one way they process them is that they talk about them.<p>My point is that it helps to appreciate that others may be more affected by recent events than you were and this is their way of processing their emotions. No need to whine about it, you can take a break from HN for a week or so until it winds down. When things are continued beyond their reasonable lifetime they tend to get moderated down.

Things I learned this way:<p>- PHP, CodeIgniter\n- Ruby, Rails\n- CSS\n- Javascript, jQuery<p>I'm hoping to get into some of the newer JS projects this way as well, node.js, backbone.js, etc.<p>I think having a deliverable project in mind keeps you focused while learning. It's an extra layer of motivation, but unlike finishing a book, you're left with a real asset. I don't think everyone learns best this way, however, and realize that others may prefer going through book exercises or online tutorials. One drawback I've ran into every time I've learned this way is that you tend to cut corners out of ignorance and end up having to invest time down the road in either learning things your project didn't require or unlearning the bad habits you picked up when you were focused on the end rather than the means.<p>I will say that I failed miserably when I had an idea for an iPhone app and jumped in head first this way. The process was intensely frustrating and I felt like I spent a lot of time spinning my wheels. Looking back, I would have been much better off working through an intro book on iPhone / Cocoa development than trying to piecemeal educational materials and tutorials.

At one point, my boss (!) even confided in me that she rose very quickly up the ranks not by working hard, but by freeing herself up from her work in order to plan frivolous, but high-visibility office socials. (She sounded genuinely guilt-ridden in saying as much, though I suspect she was pretty good at compartmentalizing that guilt in the long run).<p>Now, I'm not a naif. I realize that office politics is always going to be a decisive factor in one's career at BigCorp (if not in general). And I'm all for a fun office function. But when politics is the <i>sole</i> criterion for advancement, something's rotten in Denmark.<p>Incidentally, I've noticed a strong correlation between this type of culture and the poor performance of said company. There's a general feeling, among middle management types, that the company is basically a giant ATM. You clock in, collect a fairly generous paycheck, and spend your time trying to do as little as possible for it.<p>By contrast, what subsequently attracted me so much to the tech industry was a genuine engagement with one's job. You may not love every day of it, but you feel connected to what you're doing, and you actually want to see the results in the market. Typically there are fewer layers of abstraction between your work and the actual product, and so there's less room to emotionally distance yourself from it and slip into the clock in / clock out mentality.",1358362939

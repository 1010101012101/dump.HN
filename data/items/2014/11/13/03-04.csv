Scala collections avoid a lot of boilerplate with canBuildFrom, SeqLike and suck, but simple and straightforward they are not. It takes quite a while before it stops reading like Japanese.<p>And IMO yes, a lot of symbolic methods in collections make relatively little sense. Don&#x27;t forget that list also has ::, :::, +:, :+ and :\. There&#x27;s more than a few, and there are no textual versions of them, for those that don&#x27;t have them all memorized. They are a bit of a relic from the time Martin thought that /: was a good idea. It&#x27;s fortunate that now only the scalaz people keep doing such things, because excessive use of symbolic operations hurt language adoption.<p>And he doesn&#x27;t even get into other early confusion points, like how we have =>, <-, and ->, or how decomposing Seqs is not exactly pretty. Last week I had to help a guy that had been using Scala for 6 months to understand the &#x27;punched in the face&#x27; operator :_*<p>So no, it&#x27;s definitely not FUD. Are they issues that hurt my day to day Scala use? Not at all. Scala is my favorite language. Being able to use it instead of Java or Clojure is worth a good 15K a year for me.But that doesn&#x27;t mean that I have forgotten some of the little things that made the learning curve tough at first.

They understand both the business and technology side and have had several successful exits.<p>This is all great, but because of this, they&#x27;re self funding and not offering a lot of equity, but a pretty competitive salary (10% drop from my current mark which is on the high end in my location). My risk is essentially nil, and my upside will be nice if we&#x27;re successful, but I&#x27;d like to have more skin in the game than the 2%, grant not option, they&#x27;re offering at the start.<p>We&#x27;ve started doing some work and I&#x27;m making most of the technical decisions, developing our architecture plan, etc. This is my first time at the ground floor, like we don&#x27;t have an office yet ground floor.<p>On the plus side the founders can fund us for a while, and if things go well we&#x27;d probably be able to skip several rounds of funding, leading to less dilution.

I think it would more generally apply to any middleware business. But it is certainly more palatable for people in scientific computing and HPC to use something free and later pay for support and services and addons. Once people start really relying on the free thing, that reliance can be monetized. In this sense, it is more &quot;scalable&quot; to have an open source product which is readily adoptable by early users than to attempt to sell a product to buyers that have not yet started to rely upon it and have a good distance to go before reliance sets in. This is not SaaS and never will be, haha.<p>Allocation of future resources is something that we have considered a lot.

Collection. Information shall be considered as &quot;collected&quot; only when it has been received for use by an employee of a DoD intelligence component in the course of his official duties. Thus, information volunteered to a DoD intelligence component by a cooperating source would be &quot;collected&quot; under this procedure when an employee of such component officially accepts, in some manner, such information for use within that component. Data acquired by electronic means is &quot;collected&quot; only when it has been processed into intelligible form.&quot;</i><p>That would include sent to the NSA, processed by algorithms and stored. The &quot;read by a human definition&quot; as far as I can tell comes from the EFF selectively quoting that definition[2] and drawing their own conclusions from their selective quotation, not the regulation itself. As the regulation itself states, as soon as any DoD intelligence components receives it and processes it, it is considered collected.<p>The misunderstanding is compounded by Clapper&#x27;s June 9th 2013 interview with Andrea Mitchell, where he tries to explain that there&#x27;s a legal difference between collecting content and metadata and fails miserably[3]. Mind you, Clapper is not part of the NSA.

This is why smokers who never work out are usually extremely thin- they typically eat very little. That isn&#x27;t of course to suggest that that is healthier than being a non-smoker who is overweight, but rather to show in an extreme case that for fat loss exercise is extremely overrated while simple calorie restriction is not given nearly enough attention.<p>The formula that I know works for me is calorie restriction and limiting carb/sugar intake as much as possible. This requires rethinking what is pretty much considered gospel in the U.S. Pretty much all breakfast foods other than eggs are just sugar and carbs and extremely fattening. Additionally, most meals in U.S. restaurants are about three times the size of what is actually needed to sufficiently sustain you until your next meal. If you want to lose weight and keep it off, increase your protein intake and cut your overall calorie and sugar intake.",1415848154

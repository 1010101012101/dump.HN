For international students studying in the US, I would highly recommend being on a F-1 visa instead of a J-1 visa and then applying for a CPT (or OPT if you are done with college) for an internship. J-1 has a requirement of working for two years in your home country after graduation. If you plan to continue working for the startup after graduation, this 2 year requirement could become a big issue (you need to apply for a J-1 waiver and do quite some paperwork to get rid of it).<p>In general, for international students studying in the US who want to start companies or work at an early stage startup in the US, I would recommend reading up the CPT and OPT rules. Those can be very useful in the early days until you have sufficient funding to move to a visa category like H-1B that has a minimum salary requirement.",1289973384

RAM is transient; SSDs and magnetic disk are both persistent. Hence, both SSDs and magnetic disk can serve as stable storage. SSDs and HDs have different performance characteristics, but I'm not so sure that a radical rethinking of the storage hierarchy is actually called for.<p><i>a big reason our lengthy boot-up procedure even exists is because we had to have a spinning disk</i><p>Offhand, I would guess that a big reason for lengthy bootups is the time required to probe, detect and configure hardware (plus latency stuff like BIOS init).

It made the concurrency decisions for you ahead of time, and if you need a different concurrency model, you're up shit creek.<p>It's not true. I'm not sure what concurrency models you feel you need but let's go through the most popular ones. There's event based programming which is essentially single-threaded and predicated on structuring your code around poll/kqueue/whatever loop. You can do that in Go since you can call any OS syscall from Go. It just leads to awkward code.<p>There's shared memory multithreading with locks to protect data structures. You can do that in Go (except you use goroutines, which are multiplexed into OS threads by Go scheduler, instead of using OS threads directly as in C).<p>And then there's Go's prefferred (but not exclusive) solution of channels/goroutines and idea of sharing memory by communicating (as opposed to communicating by sharing memory as in threads/locks based model).<p>What concurrency models are available in C or Python or Java that you can't do in Go?<p>> So is my Radio Flyer Wagon.  You still can't do systems programming, embedded, high performance, or real-time work with it.<p>As a rebuttal (?), it doesn't follow. As to your point, your definition of systems programming is different from that used by Go designers, since they are very insistent on calling Go a systems programming language. Please clarify what kind of systems programming you can do in C/Java that you can't do in Go?<p>As to high-performance: I don't follow. It's fast. What kind of high performance programming you can't do in Go that you can do in C or Java?<p>As to embedded - sure that niche is owned by C. How is it different from Python or Java and how does that make Go a niche language?<p>The same goes for real-time where real-time systems are even more niche and are as much a property of the OS as it is of the language. You can't do real-time in any language on stock Linux kernel given that kernel can pre-empt any application at any time for any period of time.<p>You make a lot of statements but nothing concrete enough to support them.<p>I've shown that in Go you can use 3 concurrency models, 2 of which are currently most popular in the C/Java worlds.<p>As to systems programming - you don't provide a definition or examples of what kind of programs do you consider as systems programming so it's hard to argue at that level.<p>Does a web server qualify? (you can write one Go).<p>Would a distributed database like HBase qualify? Even though one hasn't been written, HBase is Java and there's nothing that you can write in Java that you can't write in Go, with potentially better performance due to compilation to native code and more efficient memory usage.",1289971128

Several people in the scipy community have reported having gone from C++ to numpy/scipy and went faster at the same time - because C++ is so hard to use correctly, people whose job is not even programming ended up doing things very fast but one millions times because they don't understand their code.<p>This point is surprisingly not understood by a majority of programmers.

If you (re-)declare a rule (through `assert`), the entire constraint database is actually re-evaluated behind the scenes. The big problem in conversational declarative programming is how to start with general-purpose rules, and work downward with more and more special-case exceptions, without each new assertion taking longer to integrate into the database than the last.<p>Inform is an exapmple of a natural-language-ish, rule-based system (for programming text adventures), that <i>could</i> efficiently re-declare rules in a REPL (if not for its basis in virtual machine image formats that expect to be compiled from complete specifications.) Inform guarantees efficiency by using a hub-and-spoke system of rules: rather than every rule having the possibility to interact with every other rule, rules can only interact with rules in their own ""rulebook"" (module), the core rulebooks (standard library), and the ""meta"" rulebook (monkeypatches to re-specify libraries.) Thus, integrating a new definition only takes O(k + n + e) time—where k, n, and e should all be small—rather than O(n^2). This works well for Inform, but I'm not sure whether it would be as effective in a general-purpose programming environment.",1289970595

MySpace, Facebook).<p>What if the startup includes mobile features (twitter), or deals with video/music (Slacker, YouTube, etc).<p>Licensing, lawyer fees, scaling, development costs - they are all relative to what action your startup is taking.<p>Yes, if you are just building a blog or the next MySpace-killer (which will fail and you suck at life if that's what you are attempting) - yeah, you could pull it off by yourself with a $7 per month shared hosting package.\n",1189324548

So they prioritize crimes of varying types.<p>Why have they prioritised ticketing members of the public on the freeways for minor speed offenses?  <p>The freeways are the safest roads by an order of magnitude when measured by accidents per mile traveled.<p>Going 10mph over in a 60 mph compared to ten over in a 25 is  a trivial increase in speed and danger.<p>The freeway speed limits were set due to a temporary economic condition, why do we still have them?<p>A blanket speed limit is madness when taking into account differing vehicles and differing driver abilities.  A trained police pursuit driver with ten years of high speed escort duty, driving a modern porsche on a day off is limited to the same speed as a new driver in a 20 year old POS.<p>So in answer to your question, yes the police should not use cameras or speed traps on the freeways and rural roads.  A marked highly visible patrol car is a much better solution.<p>Instead the police cars should be in town controlling speed where it is most likely to be fatal, should be concentrating on tail gating, should be prosecuting inattentive drivers, ticketing drivers with no lane control etc etc.  <p>Ticketing drivers on freeways for speeding can only be for one of two reasons either it's $$$ or it's bumping up the arrest/prosecution figures.

Sometimes motivational pieces for business people seem to state the obvious, but this article chooses to focus in the connection between leadership skills and general productivity outside of pure leadership roles, making it inspirational for anyone.\n",1189322214

For me, making programs short is not a design goal. But if it would, I would do it like above. My framework then would include this functionality:<p><pre><code>  S[] contains all session variables
  P[] contains all posted variables
  PtoS copies an entry from P to S. Returns false if P was not set.
  link() prints a link
  form() shows a form with the given fields. target is the current url.</code></pre>",1202038512

Also, how can you tell that they're not going to go under in a few months?<p>What generally happens when startups run out of money?  I assume they get bought out for pennies or liquidate their assets.<p>I searched a bit and found a few websites that answered this, but I think they were more geared towards companies with IPOs as exit strategies versus smaller web companies hoping to either turn a profit or get bought out.",1202037021

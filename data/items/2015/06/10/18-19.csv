9694502,comment,9693722,9693722,0,0,Someone1234,,,"I&#x27;m all for women having more choice/options, but it seems very odd to me that the FDA was delaying this drug due to concerns over its safety, and now after an &quot;intense lobbying campaign&quot; it is approved. Is that normally how drug approvals work? You ignore safety concerns if there is a big public outcry?<p>If women literally start to suffer negative health effects, it will be on the FDA&#x27;s hands but also on the hands of these &quot;women&#x27;s charities&quot; who wanted to ignore the health effects to &quot;even the score.&quot;<p>I like this quote:<p>> “To approve this drug will set the worst kind of precedent — that companies that spend enough money can force the F.D.A. to approve useless or dangerous drugs,” Dr. Adriane Fugh-Berman of Georgetown University told the committee Thursday. She is the director of PharmedOut, a project that questions the influence of drug companies on the practice of medicine.<p>I just think the drug should be approved just like any other, on the basis of its safety Vs. relative merits. As far as I know Viagra and other male-orientated drugs also had to go through that same rigor.<p>PS - Men likely benefit from this just as much as women. However men too will suffer if their love ones are injured by poorly evaluated side-effects.",1433962788

9694429,comment,9693987,9694384,0,0,duskwuff,,,"Part of the problem there is that the DMCA (and arguably the legal system in general) doesn&#x27;t deal well with pseudonymity. Contesting a DMCA takedown requires that you send your real name and contact information to the service provider and to the sender of the DMCA. This ends up making the DMCA a dangerous harassment tool; targeted individuals end up with an unpalatable choice between allowing their harassers to force any content of theirs to be taken offline (which will often cause their accounts to be suspended on sites like YouTube!), or giving their harassers their personal information.<p>But more generally -- yes, it&#x27;s a huge problem that the DMCA has few consequences for &quot;spray and pray&quot; takedowns. While there are some provisions in the law for damages against <i>knowingly</i> issuing an invalid takedown, it&#x27;s incredibly hard to prove (I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s ever happened!), and in any case, it doesn&#x27;t apply if the takedown was simply sent in error.

If I can make 4.5% risk-free paying off a mortgage vs 6% in stocks, I&#x27;d pay off the mortgage. But here is another consideration I&#x27;ve never seen discussed before: mortgage interest is static, but investment returns are dynamic. My mortgage interest rate is fixed for <i>30 years</i>, and that&#x27;s a long time for the stock market to change. What I mean is, the day I close, my interest rate is probably only a little lower than stock market returns. But surely in 10 or 20 years the stock market will have times at 10% or 15% returns, and I&#x27;ll still have that low-interest mortgage. It almost seems unfair to the bank! So even though my natural inclination is to pour retirement savings into my mortgage, I wonder if it would be better to keep the leverage of such a low-interest loan so I&#x27;ll have cash for investing when the market has better returns or lower risk. 30 years is a long time.

It&#x27;s often positioned below the fold, and there aren&#x27;t many indicators that there is more content if the user scrolls down.<p>I probably have a different perspective than most, but here&#x27;s why I enjoy Duolingo&#x27;s style:<p>The first foreign language I began learning was Spanish. I took it throughout high school and college. I was taught theory first, so I could understand most of what I&#x27;d read or hear following the new lesson. Running the input through the theory I&#x27;d established in my brain worked, but it was very slow and took a lot of practice to speed up my speaking and understanding.<p>When I was visiting my wife in Brazil while we were dating, I learned Portuguese very differently. Although they were aware that I didn&#x27;t speak Portuguese, many of her friends and relatives did not let that reason hold them back from speaking it to me anyway. So I was bombarded with the language, and slowly began to understand more and more. First, I&#x27;d only understand one word in a phrase, then 25% of it, then 50% and so on until I reached a critical point where I understood enough of what was being said that I could use the context of what I did understand to infer the rest and learn that too.<p>Learning Portuguese was so much quicker for me. I still know more Spanish theory, but I still speak and understand it too slowly to consider myself fluent. On the other hand, Brazilians tell me all the time that they&#x27;re impressed with how well I speak Portuguese.<p>I think the jumping right into the deep end style of learning Duolingo offers is fun, but may not be the best for everyone.",1433961399

It&#x27;s a situation that most techies aren&#x27;t used to: Compression algorithms don&#x27;t compress less as the years go by, and sorting algorithms don&#x27;t sort slower. But encryption algorithms get easier to break; something that sufficed three years ago might not today.<p>>Cryptographic algorithms are all vulnerable to brute force--trying every possible encryption key, systematically searching for hash-function collisions, factoring the large composite number, and so forth--and brute force gets easier with time. A 56-bit key was long enough in the mid-1970s; today that can be pitifully small. In 1977, Martin Gardner wrote that 129-digit numbers would never be factored; in 1994, one was.<p>>Aside from brute force, cryptographic algorithms can be attacked with more subtle (and more powerful) techniques. In the early 1990s, the academic community discovered differential and linear cryptanalysis, and many symmetric encryption algorithms were broken. Similarly, the factoring community discovered the number-field sieve, which affected the security of public-key cryptosystems.<p>DES was used in the 70s, now it can be brute forced in a few days (with the right hardware).",1433961336

That is either an advantage or a disadvantage -- mostly depending on your personal preference. The strength of the imperative approach is that when computation is a combination of logic and memory effects, it yields a more powerful computational model than pure functions alone (that&#x27;s why Turing machines can describe computations that lambda calculus cannot -- at least not directly; their equivalence mostly rests on LC&#x27;s ability to be used as a meta-language that can simulate a Turing-machine language). It allows representing many algorithms that PFP simply cannot (in Haskell, many algorithms are implemented with unsafe). Finally, it yields better performance (computational complexity is a very vague notion in lambda calculus).<p>> But mocks are only used in tests!<p>I was referring to a mock as a concept, not a particular implementation. If you can&#x27;t find a mocking library that replays operations, write one that does. It would fit much better and be much more idiomatic. See below for an explanation.<p>> I think many people dismiss functional approaches like these &quot;effect values&quot; by thinking of them at too low a level, and imagining that they must involve an awful lot of work to use.<p>I don&#x27;t dismiss pure functional approaches at all if you happen to be using a pure functional language like Haskell. Imperative languages, however, already have similar mechanisms in place, and eschewing those in favor of PFP approaches <i>is</i> more work, and tends to lose the benefit the imperative approaches have (as those are more in line with the language), for example, the stack context.<p>I will be giving a talk about this at the upcoming Curry On/ECOOP conference, where I&#x27;ll show that virtually all monads already have imperative counterparts that are preferable (and more powerful) when writing in an imperative language. The recent trend of PFP constructs being adopted by impure languages is due to two things: 1. the false notion that the PFP approach is more &quot;mathematical&quot; or more verifiable, and 2. monadic composition is better than callbacks, and thus useful in avoiding blocking OS threads, which is expensive (although simply fixing threads -- as Erlang and Go have done -- is so much easier).",1433961089

It should have enough &quot;batteries included&quot; to be immediately useful, but small enough that you can keep most/all of the framework&#x27;s API in your head at any given time.<p>Then again, I sometimes wonder myself if the definition blurs over the age and maturity of the project. If you look at Flask&#x27;s ecosystem, there are extensions for nearly <i>everything</i>, making it so that ecosystem as a whole does just as much as a full-featured framework, but you have greater choice as to what components to include (and there&#x27;s not One True Way to do anything in particular--there&#x27;s just extensions that are more well-supported than others, well-maintained, and more popular).<p>I suppose this means that the better analogue is that micro frameworks give you greater control over lower level aspects and make fewer decisions for you (e.g. Django more or less expects you to do things Django&#x27;s way; Flask has fewer such expectations). Given some of the micro frameworks I&#x27;ve seen, though, I think it&#x27;s a definite spectrum, not an absolute, and probably depends just as much on the ecosystem and culture surrounding the language as it does on the intent of the creators. Silex (the PHP framework) does very few things, for instance, but it seems that you ought to include healthy chunks of Symfony if you really want it to be usable.<p>That said, I did stumble across something called &quot;sinetja&quot; [1] which I&#x27;d bill as an <i>absolute</i> micro-framework in Java in that it provides a fairly bare bones RESTful router/API and not much else. Think of it as another data point on the spectrum of micro-frameworks but much closer toward the bring-your-own-everything-else half.<p>So, if you want to roll your own bits to interface with 3rd party libraries or handle common tasks, use a micro-framework.

9694106,comment,9691473,9692224,0,0,cpprototypes,,,"The functional style eliminates types of bugs that can happen with for loops and makes the code easier to read.  For example, consider the task of removing names that start with &quot;B&quot; from a list.  This is the for loop way:<p><pre><code>    List<String> names = Lists.newArrayList(&quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Tom&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Brandon&quot;, &quot;John&quot;, &quot;James&quot;, &quot;Ben&quot;);\n    List<String> bNames = new ArrayList<>();\n    for (String name : names) {\n        if (name.startsWith(&quot;B&quot;)) {\n            bNames.add(name);\n        }\n    }\n    names.removeAll(bNames);\n</code></pre>\nAnd the functional way:<p><pre><code>    names = names.stream().filter(name -> !name.startsWith(&quot;B&quot;)).collect(Collectors.toList());\n</code></pre>\nThe basic problem with the for loop is that you need create a temporary list to do the work.  It&#x27;s low level coding that requires telling the computer exactly where to put the temporary results, then what to do with it.  I&#x27;ve seen bugs where developers accidentally return the wrong list (such as bNames in this example) or later modify the wrong one.  When the code becomes more complicated, there&#x27;s often a lot of these temporary variables that greatly reduce code readability and allow subtle bugs to occur.",1433959345

9694092,comment,9692635,9693612,0,0,baakss,,,"From the Zenefits CEO in Emails to customers (calling ADP unethical for protecting their customers data):<p>When you originally set up Zenefits, you created an Zenefits admin user in your ADP RUN payroll account to let Zenefits manage your payroll—set up new employees, manage deductions, remove departing employees—on your behalf.<p>Yesterday, without your permission, ADP systematically deactivated these accounts—accounts that you set up, in your payroll system, to allow Zenefits to work on your behalf. The reason for this is that ADP believes it can one day build software to compete with Zenefits, and in the meantime they would like to do anything they can to impede Zenefits.<p>ADP is claiming that they are taking this action for “security” reasons—but this is clearly not true. For years, ADP has let customers add third parties—a bookkeeper or an accounting firm, for example—to their payroll system to manage payroll on a company’s behalf. What Zenefits does is no different. In fact, even today, ADP will let you add a third-party administrator to your payroll system unless they have a Zenefits.com email address.<p>What’s high-handed about their approach is that Zenefits is still completely compatible with ADP payroll. All they’ve done is make it more inconvenient for you, their customer.<p>By default, we will start emailing you whenever there are changes that need to be made to your payroll system. We will detail exactly the changes that need to be made, and you can make them yourself in payroll. It’s less convenient this way — and frustrating that ADP has decided to create more work for their own clients in order to attack Zenefits. But beyond this, nothing will interrupt your use of Zenefits.<p>We are also working on other options for restoring automated payroll. Zenefits’ mission is to make running your business as effortless as possible, and our support team will follow up shortly with additional information on how to resolve this issue.<p>We think it’s outrageous—and unethical—that ADP is making these changes to your payroll system without your permission, and is creating this complication for you in their attempt to block Zenefits’ service—essentially treating you like a pawn in their corporate chess game.<p>If you’re as upset with ADP as we are, you can sign this Change.org petition. In addition, if you’re interested in switching from ADP payroll to Intuit Payroll, we’re paying customers $1,000 and helping them to make the switch. We’ll include instructions for this in our follow up communication.<p>We remain committed to working with ADP to find a solution to make this problem go away for all our mutual clients. In the past, we’ve directed many payroll customers to ADP, because payroll is not a service we provide. We’ve tried contacting them, but so far they have refused to return our calls. If they have any genuine concerns, we are happy to resolve them, but they have yet to express them to us.",1433959212

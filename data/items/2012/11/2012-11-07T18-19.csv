Independent developers choose tasks, fork the repository and upon completion of the task send a merge request. The company would then review the committed code and upon approval pay the developer.<p>While this at the first glimpse seems like a pretty simple and feasible model there are obviously quite a few gotchas:<p>1.) How can companies make sure developers don't use their source code for their own purposes?
2.) How can a company make sure it's not wasting time on a developer? There would have to be some sort of rating system.
3.) How could you break down more complex tasks so developers don't have to spend weeks just to understand the software they're working on.
4.) Is it possible at all to accomplish non-trivial tasks on a complex software system one doesn't have at least some sort of training on?
5.) How would you make sure a company actually pays the developer upon task completion?<p>Quite a few problems, indeed. Nevertheless, do you think such a concept might have legs?",1352313659

For any company,  the goal of having a corporate blog is to demonstrate your employees' knowledge and present interesting problems you've encountered. There are two outcomes I see from outsourcing blog posts:<p>1) interesting content which isn't directly relevant to your business. They write a good blog, but it's always going to be an arm's length from your real business. Either you mislead users about where the content comes from, or you're up front and people realize that he blog, while good, doesn't really reflect your business.<p>2) the company doesn't really have bloggers for niche enough specialties to be interesting. You end up with a broad, lookalike blog that could have been written by anybody. This stops customers from engaging with your company.<p>The correct answer is what New Relic does with The Daily WTF; sponsor an established or up and coming blogger. Make the relationship clear. Users will appreciate your funding interesting content, while understanding that you didn't create it.

It is hard not to ponder how such a complex set of behaviors came to be through natural selection alone. However, one comment that I found particularly on point is posted below:<p>""I have a suggestion for how this evolved. The initial sting to the cockroach would obviously make the cockroach's escape part of its brain light up like crazy. If the wasp then goes to find the most active part of the cockroaches brain, i'd imagine this would be the escape area. I believe there are simple rules which build up to create complex systems. These simple rules, like the active neuron sensor, help to create shortcuts to how a creature evolves. If you look at the recent darpa challenge, involving the teaching of a car how to drive across unfamiliar terrain, it managed to convince the team it was working by using just the rule of keeping the grass equally distant on the right and the left. It hit a bridge and swerved so the guy onboard had to grab the wheel! But the point is simple rules can lead to complex seeming actions."" Posted by: Rob Levy | February 4, 2006 4:28 PM",1286037645
1750770,story,,,2,2,keveman,"Ask HN:Intel's Array Building Blocks(was Rapidmind):What do the purists think?",,"Increasing programmer productivity has been a grand challenge since time immemorial. In current times, every program written has to be parallel to take advantage of many core processors. The next great parallel programming language is still waiting to get invented. With Array Building Blocks (ArBB), Intel has taken a library based approach to parallel programming. ArBB uses a mix of clever C++ operator overloading and arguably ugly preprocessor macros like _if, _for, etc to mimic C keywords to let programmers express parallel programs. People who know what they are doing could indeed write portable and scalable programs with ArBB. However, novice programmers could easily trip themselves because of the fragile nature of the macros. So what do language purists out there think? Is it wise to promote such unsafe approaches to parallel programming?",1286037639

1750752,comment,1750073,1750073,0,0,eam,,,"This is may not be the best advice, but I wanted to share my experience. In the end I just broke even.<p>When I was in high school, at the age of 16 I decided to start a ""clothing company."" At the time I already had been working part-time on the weekends, so I had been saving up. When I had about $700 saved up I told my mother I wanted to start this business of my own, she encouraged me and gave me $300, so I now had 1K in funding to launch my ""business.""<p>I knew with this small amount it would be limiting as to what I could do. At the time it seemed the cheapest thing to do was to only start with t-shirt prints. I headed to several screenprinting shops around town, but it was costly unless you got a bulk of shirts 100+. I did some online research and found this pretty cool screenprinting shop in Auburn, Alabama (I'm in California). Got in touch with them and I was able to work a great deal.<p>Next, I had to think of a name for my company. This process took a while, I went through probably hundreds of candidates before I chose one the one I felt was right. I think this was the most tedious yet most important step of the process because <i>it is</i> what represents you.<p>Once I had the name down. It was time to do some designs. To me this part was the easiest since I've been drawing for years and had recently started using Photoshop/Illustrator enough to manipulate it. I did several designs and showed them to friends and family so that they could give me feedback. I especially paid attention to friend's feedback because they were the targeted age group. I must also add that I would constantly look at clothing companies websites just to get an idea what the current ""trend"" was.<p>To start off, I just had 3 t-shirt print designs and got 50 t-shirts of each. So that was 150 shirts to start off, if my memory serves correctly it came out to roughly $4 per t-shirt. What helped a lot was that they cut the design fees since I designed the shirts myself with photoshop/illustrator.<p>As the shirts were being printed across the country. I started promoting it on MySpace (I should note, this was around 2004) and launched a website for it. Also wrote what was the beliefs and life-style that the company represented.<p>Several of my friends and acquaintances had bands in high school so I talked to them so that we could cross-promote each other. At the time my website design skills were limited to HTML and graphics so I had no idea how to even put an ecommmerce site together.<p>Nonetheless, once I had the shirts in my hands I started selling them to friends and family for $10 a pop. So I was making about $5 per shirt. Being promoted by friend's bands really helped since I sold several at local band shows. I sold all 150 and went through a couple more batches, but eventually sales dropped and I didn't want to take the time or effort to try to improve it. I decided it was a good experience and ceased it. In the end I cut even and had about 3 dozen shirts left. I gave many away for free and til this day I still have a couple left in my closet for memories.<p>Also check out <a href=""http://shop.johnnycupcakes.com/story/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shop.johnnycupcakes.com/story/</a> Johnny's story was really inspirational to me!",1286037132

I'd like to get some feedback from HN on how best to arrange a fast growing development team.<p>I have seen 3 patterns practiced each with their own strengths and weaknesses. I'm sure there are plenty more.<p>* Superman. Each sub team has an individual who acts as Project Manager/Line Manager/Tech Lead. This works very well in a small sub team (maybe 4 strong), working in a relatively small dev groups (maybe 20), but is difficult to scale.<p>* Double Act. Have two roles in each sub team, a Project/Line manager and a dedicated Tech Lead. This relieves pressure on the individuals in question and works better in larger sub teams (say 8 strong) in larger dev groups (say 40). Good for feedback and direction, but can be hard to restructure sub teams without significant discontinuity to team members.<p>* Program Manager. Have a dedicated Program Manager take care of the project side, let the sub team handle their own technical leadership in an adhoc fashion and have a more distant Development Manager responsible for overall tech direction and line management of a number of sub teams. Good for structural flexibility and cross sub team continuity but the distance of the Dev Manager means sub team problems can take longer to be spotted and resolved.<p>What are your experiences and what have you seen work best?<p>Many thanks<p>Neil",1286037075

This is actually pretty easy. Find a local screen-printer, and they'll probably be able to sell you some American Apparel (or Alternative Apparel) blank shirts at wholesale rates, and print your designs onto them. You might make about $10 per garment.  It's really, really, really not worth the effort of having tshirts or tanks custom made.<p>If you want to truly design clothes; each step of this process requires hiring someone, since you  probably don't know the skills or industry or have any contacts. Unfortunately, the newer you are at this game, the more people you have to hire, and the less money you can make. In fact, it's almost impossible to make any money at all as a new label unless you do most of the work yourself, and this involves experience and formal schooling, mostly.<p>You'll need to pay someone to sketch out your designs, and convert those into patterns. You might try doing this yourself, but this is a little like building a house without an architect. Or building a website without knowing HTML.<p>Next, you will have some samples made up, have the patterns modified so the fit is good (bigger labels actually have people called fit models). You'll need to adjust the pattern for all sizes you want to sell (XS-XXL).<p>It's best to have your samples made locally so you aren't waiting 6 weeks between revisions. Fit is everything! Once you have a few complete sample lines, you can take them around to local retail buyers and try to sell your line based on these.<p>You'll have to make sales before you actually have your garments made in bulk, unless you have a bunch of money to throw down the drain.

You'll need to hire an agent)  They won't pay you yet.<p>If you do make orders, now you can get your garments made in bulk in China, or wherever, and hopefully they can be shipped back by the time the orders are due (i.e. in time for the next season).<p>Something that takes half an hour to make will cost you several dollars in the US or tens of cents in China.<p>Unless you have a good contact at the other end, the first few runs will be horribly wrong, because people don't pay attention, particularly on new/small clients with low revenue. This happens no matter where you have things made.<p>Finally, you get your garments shipped, and then you send them off to be dyed, screen-printed, tagged, and packaged.<p>Then you deliver them to the places you sold to, and then 3 months later they pay you. Note that this is the first time you see any money in this whole process..!",1286036935

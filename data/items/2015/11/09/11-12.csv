Amazing food can be spoiled by rude waiters, or poor food can be improved by ones that are very nice.<p>In contrast, my experience with the delivery driver is limited to the 10 second it takes for them to hand me my food. Literally every single takeaway takes payment online, so for years now my food was already paid for before it was even delivered. So all the driver has to do is give me my food. He doesn&#x27;t even have to say anything, there&#x27;s no conversation to be had, &quot;delivery experience&quot; to experience. So why tip?",1447070347

The new remote for the latest Apple TV is quite good too (though it&#x27;s hard to tell which way around it should be by feel alone).<p>Unlike you, I <i>want</i> a limited remote control based UI pattern for the TV. Complexity, location of my phone, and battery life are not things I&#x27;d like to worry about when I&#x27;m at home and want to navigate the TV. Nor do I want to be staring at a little screen to setup which content to play next.<p>From an interaction perspective, what I disliked in a smartphone-as-remote was the following:<p>* Not able to navigate by feel alone, in the dark<p>* Had to unlock phone to use it. Can&#x27;t just pick it up and press a button without looking at the little screen<p>* Screen lights up and creates a distraction<p>* Battery life is measured in one or two days (and often, at night when you want to watch TV, is at its low point)<p>* Not good when you watch with a group of friends and like to navigate through shows, actors, directors on the big screen<p>* It just didn&#x27;t feel good. I realise this is a vague point, but I didn&#x27;t realise how much I valued the tactile sensation of a nice remote until its battery died and I was stuck with my phone for a while.",1447070244

Our goal was usually to find a particular value for x which is consistent with the equations, e.g. &quot;solve for x&quot; to get x = 2. Your solution of &quot;set all letters to equal 1&quot; is a perfectly valid way of achieving this kind of goal.<p>However, for the kind of algebra this article is about, we <i>don&#x27;t</i> restrict ourselves to working with numbers. Instead, we explicitly <i>avoid</i> talking about &quot;concrete&quot; representations at all. We <i>only</i> focus on the equations we&#x27;ve been given. Some sets of equations are so common that they&#x27;re given names, like &quot;group (laws)&quot;, &quot;semigroup (laws)&quot;, &quot;field (laws)&quot;, etc.<p>The quote in the article tells us what the equations are:<p>> Regard English as a left-cancellative and right-cancellative multiplicative semigroup with identity, i.e. obeying the relations XY=ZY or YZ=YX implies X=Z, and having an element “1” such that 1X=X1=X.<p><i>Lots</i> of things satisfy these equations. Some HN-relevant examples:<p>- Positive integers, where &quot;1&quot; is the number one and multiplication (written as juxtaposition &quot;xy&quot;) is integer multiplication. Notice that we can&#x27;t allow zero, since 1 * 0 = 2 * 0 does not imply that 1 = 2.<p>- Integers, where &quot;1&quot; is the number zero and multiplication is integer addition.<p>- Booleans, where &quot;1&quot; is False and multiplication is OR.<p>- Booleans, where &quot;1&quot; is True and multiplication is AND.<p>- Sets, where &quot;1&quot; is the empty set and multiplication is set union.<p>- Lists, where &quot;1&quot; is the empty list and multiplication is concatenation.<p>- Functions, where &quot;1&quot; is the identity function (i.e. &quot;identity = function(arg) { return arg; }&quot;) and multiplication is function composition (i.e. &quot;compose(x, y) = function(arg) { return x(y(arg)); }&quot;)<p>- Commands, where &quot;1&quot; is the no-op command (i.e. it performs no actions) and multiplication is sequencing (i.e. &quot;xy = x; y&quot;)<p>By focusing on the equations and ignoring any <i>particular</i> representation, our results will apply to <i>all</i> representations; making this &quot;universal algebra&quot; a very powerful method.<p>What these mathematicians have done is impose a whole load of <i>extra</i> equations on top of the semigroup laws, of the form &quot;AISLE = ISLE&quot;, etc. They&#x27;ve then shown that this large set of equations is equivalent to the single equation &quot;x = 1&quot;.<p>In other words, they&#x27;ve shown that your solution (AKA the &quot;trivial&quot; solution) is <i>the only</i> solution. In other words, by imposing these extra rules, we&#x27;ve gone from a relatively interesting system which can describe functions, commands, lists, etc. to a relatively boring one, where representations might include:<p>- The set {one}, where multiplication is integer multiplication.<p>- The set {zero}, where multiplication is integer addition.<p>- The set {False}, where multiplication is OR.<p>- The set {True}, where multiplication is AND.<p>- The set {{}}, where multiplication is set union.<p>- The set {[]}, where multiplication is concatenation.<p>- The set {identity}, where multiplication is function composition.<p>- The set {no-op}, where multiplication is sequencing.",1447069172

The result is that most projects nowadays are home-made, resulting in a generalized cacophony where it&#x27;s so hard to find quality content that people are giving up. This is what&#x27;s going to happen here as well. There is no such thing as a free lunch. Hopefully this will make people go back to real-world local structures, which are going to be profitable again.",1447066982

It&#x27;s quite likely that your three favourite shows could cost you three subscriptions (~30AUD) instead of one. Pay TV is slowly declining, but if you want sport in HD (and you do, the MPEG2 bitrate on FTA is terrible), it&#x27;s $50/month on a 12 month contract.<p>If I have to buy an Apple TV for some things, an XBox One for others and an Amazon TV (if they ever release it) for Unnamed New Top Gear Show I&#x27;m just gonna give up and use my extra time to learn Haskell.<p>(I did try IPTV, but my downstream speed is 8 megabit on a good day and it wasn&#x27;t enough).",1447066925

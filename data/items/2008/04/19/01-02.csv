When you are creating an entirely new product, getting things right without direct feedback from users is virtually impossible. The company that wins is the company that receives and responds to feedback the fastest.""<p>This is my biggest problem.

That's the point.<p>I could probably do it, but not blindfolded -- I'd have to work out (or look up) the details, because R/B-trees are the one data structure I learned in college that I have never once used.<p>But I do know at least one person who can implement a R/B-tree in assembly off the top of his head.

Restrict the time to blocks of 90's of video instruction per user (like flickr) - a section for ingredients another for prep, the cook, and finally presentation. Then see what other users can upload.  Maybe a <i>""how do you do this segment""</i> for basic cooking tasks, different cuisines etc. Gradually building up a catalogue of rated segments a user can choose to view.<p>If I've learnt anything about recipe books, websites  is they are inanimate and unless you are determined you can stuff things up. TV comes up trumps.  An online video collection of recipes just might improve on TV.",1208569297

I don't even use a Mac.)<p>As far as I can tell, the idea is to sell a bundle of Mac software over a limited period of time.  Some of the pieces in the bundle are ""locked"" and will only be given out to the buyers (""unlocked"") if certain sales thresholds are reached before the end.<p>The incentive for users to convince their friends to also buy is obvious, while also being a lot more elegant than a simple commission.<p>I realize after typing this that it might seem slightly spam-like, but it's not.

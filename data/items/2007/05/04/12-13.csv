19345,comment,19203,19206,0,0,naish,,,"Same here.  It is such a great device that, rather than go with a current model, I purchased a replacement on eBay when my original was stolen back in January.  (Be very careful with hotel selection in Punteranas, Costa Rica--my machine was stolen out of my backpack in my hotel room while I was out for the day.  Thankfully, the idiots left the external HD, iSight, power supply, etc.)<p>That said, I still am waiting for Apple to get their act together and release a 12"" MacBook Pro.  I'd like to be able to run a variety of operating systems via Parallels.  Interfacing with the corporate/industrial world unfortunately necessitates the use of Windows-only software.  Virtual PC just doesn't cut it.  Rumours suggest that one may be in the works but, for now, they seem to be just wishful thinking from other like-minded individuals.",1178282259

But the orange for the bottom two-thirds of the page is way too over-powering and I'd leave the site just to give my eyes a rest.<p>Hey, I think I'm third -- ralph@inputplus.co.uk -- thanks.",1178282203
19342,comment,19186,19186,0,0,Goladus,,,"I was actually just thinking yesterday about how woefully inadequete local area webforums tend to be.  All the right people still seem to have their nose in a newspaper (or are working for one).<p>I didn't come up with a good way to solve the problem.  Maybe this is an attempt to do that.",1178281847
19341,comment,19036,19089,0,0,Goladus,,,"Unfortunately any large company that wants to grow will have to do things that some people, somewhere might consider evil.  I suspect in this forum, no one would think anything of Google driving a hard bargain with the local government in Lenoir, North Carolina regarding a new datacenter.  That's just business and Google's playing fair.  Not everyone agrees with that, though.<p>But I agree a lot of the extra scrutiny comes from the chance to point a finger and scream ""hypocrisy!""",1178281423

Companies will always be thirsty for better ways to understand their customers, and now with the ease at which new internet companies are started and more people become connected, the demand for those services is only going to increase.  If SAS can continue to outperform by investing in R&D and adopt new ways to bring in fresh talent (ie use more open-source tools) to keep them ahead of the curve, they'll do just fine.",1258851104

955174,comment,955061,955061,0,0,hyperbovine,,,"I think the article misses an important point: SAS is a generational thing, and the influence of generation that cut their teeth on SAS and VAX mainframes in the 1980s is waning. There's a reason why the SAS ads you see in the airports are all targeted at management--because that's where all those people work now. And soon they will retire.<p>They would never dare advertise to the poor analysts who are forced to actually <i>use</i> SAS to get work done, because we know what turd it is. I do not think I exaggerate when I say that not a single up-and-coming statistician in this day and age chooses expensive, obfuscated SAS as the language with which to hone their skills. It is truly the worst language I have ever had the misfortune of being forced to learn (by an old professor, who knew SAS and refused to learn anything else.) Somebody back me up here.<p>There are a few areas where SAS is unrivaled--it can crunch huge data and exploit parallel processing better than other off-the-shelf solutions. That feature gap will close over time as R and other open tools rise in popularity. And there will always be a niche market for SAS programmers because many companies have huge libraries of SAS code which run their credit card/oil rig/whatever analytics, and starting from scratch is not an option. But SAS's dominance is unquestionably on the decline, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that next generation a) isn't being trained on SAS and b) doesn't want to be.",1258850443

If you do not have horse power you cannot produce any torque. Horse power is the cause and torque is the effect. And torque is the cause, and uphill motion is the effect. So Horse power is the ultimate cause.<p>If we are going to nitpick with definitions, let us do it properly.

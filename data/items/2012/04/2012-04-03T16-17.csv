Unfortunately we're using 5 stars, and need to do it a bit less wrong.<p>The main thorniness of 5 stars is that you have to answer the question of what the difference in star ratings actually mean.  Is going from one star to two stars the same as four to five?  Probably not, based on the way users rate, which means an algorithm like the arithmetic mean that treats them the same is wrong.<p>Personally, I think it's very reasonable to treat rating stars the way we should treat grades: as ordinal data, where we know that a higher rating is better but assume nothing beyond that.  The difference between an F and a D is not the same as an A and a B, and the same is likely true of 1-2 stars and 4-5 stars.<p>I have made an attempt at applying this idea to the Ubuntu App Store's rating algorithm.

Weve seen software to help us with mundane paperwork and calculation type tasks, but now technology is reaching an entirely new level. The ease with which were able to control the physical world from something as common place as our smartphones is here!<p>Lets talk a little bit about the Arduino and its insane capacity to control our physical world from a mobile device.<p>There are already a couple good resources on setting up the iPhone to communicate with an Arduino. I recommend going through this tutorial first:<p>http://makeprojects.com/Project/Connect-an-iPhone-iPad-or-iPod-touch-to-Arduino-with-the-Redpark-Serial-Cable/1130/1<p>Currently, one of the simplest ways to make your iPhone control a motor, array of LED lights, or a household appliance is to use serial communication. Serial communication is a standard protocol that allows you to transmit bytes over a cable link. The Red Park cable allows you to convert an iPhone port to a traditional serial communication port that you can feed into the Arduino. This gives you the ability to communicate messages between your iPhone/iPad and a physical device connected to an Arduino.<p>When communicating via the serial communication port, one of the more complicated tasks is managing the messages that go between the iPhone device and the Arduino. There are a range of communication protocols that you can define using the byte length characters that can be sent over serial communication. We are going to go over two basic types of communication: state-based execution and a data load sequence.<p>1) state-based execution<p>A simple switch communication protocol is as easy as it sounds. Within your Arduino code, you will read in the serial data:<p>byte cmd;<p>cmd = Serial.read();<p>and then create a switch statement to execute different functions based on the read-in character (which indicates the desired state).<p><pre><code>      switch(cmd){

        case p:

          //play function

          break;

        case u:

          //pause function

          break;

        case r:

          //resume function

          break;
</code></pre>
2) Load Sequence<p>A more complex implementation of Serial communication may require you to actually transmit useful data between the iPhone and the Arduino. In this case, you would need to define a protocol to communicate that information. We will again use an implementation of the flag-based execution, but will add a character l to define a mode to load data.<p><pre><code>        case l:

          //load function

          break;
</code></pre>
Next we need to define the data package that we will be sending to the Arduino. An example would be to define the number of bytes for necessary metadata and then assume the remainder of the package is the described data. An example of metadata would be to have the first 4 bytes of each data package contain the size of the data package by taking the sum of the first 4 bytes. This allows you to correctly parse the data in the Arduino code.<p>We should then define the load function that will actually read in data from the iPhone. This function will need to read in a series of data pieces from the iPhone. The first piece would be the meta data so you could immediately set a mode for reading the meta data as follows (mode = 1):<p><pre><code>      if(mode ==-1){

        if(index < 4){

          dataLength = dataLength+Serial.read();

          index++;

        }

      }
</code></pre>
This bit of code will read in the meta data while in meta data mode and give you the total data package length.<p>With the data package length, you can then easily read in the remainder of the data using a similar mode for data read (mode = 2):<p><pre><code>      if(mode ==2){

        if(index < dataLength){

          data[index] = Serial.read();

        index++;

        }
</code></pre>
Now that weve taken care of the Arduino side, lets take a look at how the data is being sent from the iPhone. If youve successfully completed the Redpark tutorial, you should be familiar with the RscMgr package. The iPhone code will simply take an array of data and send it using the RscMgr command for serial write. Here is an example of code you can put in your button-click function:<p><pre><code>         //define a temporary array

         UInt8 temp[dataLength+1];

    temp[0] = l;

    for(int i=1; i<dataLength;i++){

        temp[i+1] = (UInt8)someDataElement; //for example a digit = 0

    }


          //send data over serial connection

    for (int i = 0; i<songLength; i++) {

        txBuffer[i] = temp[i];

        if (i%128 == 0) {

            [rscMgr write:txBuffer Length:128];

            NSLog(@wrote index:%i,i);

        }

        else if (songLength == i)

            [rscMgr write:txBuffer Length:128];

    }
</code></pre>
Youll notice that the buffer size here is defined in lengths of 128 bytes. If your data package is more than 128 bytes, you will have to create an extra handler to combine the data after being sent over serial. This is due to limitations of the Arduino serial buffer size. Another important consideration is the memory limitations of your Arduino model. An Arduino Uno model only has 2 MB of memory available to read and store real-time data. Not ideal for a production package in many cases, but great for creating prototypes!<p>Here you have it, a data package communicated to the Arduino from the iPhone.

In fact, look at RFC4475[1], which seems to delight in all the strange ways a message can still be valid.<p>It even uses the word ""infer"" several times. ""An element may attempt to be liberal in what it receives and infer the missing quotes.""<p>SIP was based on HTTP because at one point they thought it would interop with HTTP. Of course, that didn't happen, and they still kept HTTP's crazy parsing rules, while adding all sorts of their own things.<p>The date format, for instance, really annoys me. Who would ever look at ""Sat, 13 Nov 2010 23:29:00 GMT"" and say ""yea, that makes sense for a protocol""? Why is it done that way? Oh, that's defined in another RFC. If you trace it back, you end up decades ago in RFC500-something, and the justification is basically ""well there's some mail programs out there, and people seem to be writing their headers like this, so here's sort of a standardised version of what they're doing"". And since then, they just carry it forward, instead of thinking ""wait, does this make sense""?<p>So, that legacy thinking, combined with a stubborn insistence that Postel's Law makes sense (instead of just making things much worse), and denial of reality (such as the hilarious attempts at dealing with NAT), yea, that's why SIP is horrible. If they had their own binary format, well it would have been much worse. (And SIP's problems are still deeper, even after you finish writing the horribly convoluted code require to parse such a ""simple"" format -- so ASN.1 would have just helped a bit; you can bet there'd also be embedded strings, with precisely the same problems.)<p>1: <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4475.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4475.txt</a>",1333471049

Honda Civic vs. Mercedes Benz
We suspect that some of our over-priced competitors will look at our new pricing and make the comment, you get what you pay for, or you cant expect to pay the same for a luxurious Mercedes Benz as you would for a Honda Civic. While those traditional sentiments and analogies may generally hold true for physical goods, they dont apply to software.<p>With physical goods, the old adage, you get what you pay for is generally true, but it doesnt necessarily apply to software. With software, each user gets a product thats worth what the entire group of users has collectively paid for.
Its worth examining what that means. Since the cost of a new user is exceptionally low for software vendors, price is simply a function of volume. If a software product that costs $50 million to develop attracts 100 million users, it will generate fantastic profits even if its priced at just $1 per user (for simplicitys sake, Im ignoring the cost of supporting each user). That same product would lose millions of dollars at a price of $1,000 per user, if it only attracted a few thousand users at that price point. In contrast, if Mercedes Benz could sell 100 million cars tomorrow for $10,000 each, they would lose a fantastic amount of money. Despite the $1 trillion in revenues these sales would generate, the cost of producing 100 million Mercedes Benz sedans will far exceed $1 trillion in materials alone.<p>So, in the software industry sometimes it is possible for the Mercedes Benz of software to have a Honda price tag! It might even have a skateboard price tag!  You get what you pay for doesnt apply. Another way to put this is that its impossible to tell which software product is the Mercedes Benz of its class based on price alone. Youre better off giving it a test drive and deciding for yourself.

3793471,comment,3792403,3793212,6,0,eric_bullington,,,"I know that some PL experts tend to write off syntax as an issue of secondary importance, but for many developers, it's a critical part of code readability.  I've spent much too much time trying to untangle masses of  ill-written JavaScript with various (or no) levels of indentation, and braces scattered across the screen.  I love working with Python, CoffeeScript, and Haskell because the code is almost always very readable because of whitespace (from what I've seen, Ruby is also very readable).  I'm intensively interested in Rust as a possible alternative to C or C++ -- Go is a notstarter since I can't even compile as shared object library in it.  However, I wish the designers of Rust had taken the arguments for whitespace into serious consideration.  There's a large number of Python and Ruby programmers looking for an alternative to C and C++ as a lower-level language to call using an FFI when we need more speed, and for most of us, readability (and therefore syntax) is a major issue. Nonetheless, Rust seems like a very cool language, and I'm looking forward to trying it out.",1333469204

Basically, as the FAQ says, ""you can break the rules, if explicit about where and how"".<p>We've learned that, especially when it comes to concurrency, there really is no one model that supports everything you might want to do. Instead, the idea is to support safe, data-race-free language constructs, and to make those the easiest ones to use. Data races (and memory unsafety) are clearly marked in ""unsafe"" blocks, with the idea that if you find a concurrency bug in your software, you can grep for that keyword and go over those blocks only, instead of having to crawl through the entire codebase.<p>The same principle applies to null. You can get nullable pointers (use option<T>), but you have to declare that that's what you want. You also have to declare some strategy for handling the null case every time you use the pointer, or at least communicate your intent to fail on null via the .get() method. The vast majority of pointers in any program aren't nullable, so in practice we've found that this eliminates a lot of bugs.",1333468975

3494580,comment,3494389,3494524,12,0,reuven,,,"The article and video don't seem to be arguing that it's bad to lower costs.  They aren't even saying that it's inherently bad to outsource some of these functions to China and other countries.<p>Rather, there seem to be two points:<p>(1) Ignoring the cost of labor (which everyone thinks is the reason that US companies outsource to China), it's still logical to send manufacturing to China.  Their  plants, labor force, and supply chains are all better suited to the needs of high-tech manufacturing than anywhere in the US.<p>(2) Moving all of these manufacturing jobs to China (or elsewhere) has not only meant the loss of many mid-skill manufacturing jobs in the US, but also many jobs that were created to support those jobs, to a degree that the service sector doesn't even come close to reaching.  This has long-term ramifications for US jobs, in that many of the traditional middle-class jobs that people used to be able to get no longer exist.<p>It certainly sounds to me as though the US should not expect to get any of these manufacturing jobs back.  It also seems unlikely that you can train an entire country to do white-collar, high-tech and service-sector jobs.  And while I know that the US continues to do a huge amount of manufacturing, it's with many fewer (and more highly-skilled) employees than ever before.<p>So, what's an economy to do?  It's easy for me to tell my own children to study hard and to try to get good jobs, but that's not scalable, nor is it realistic.  Maybe when everyone can manufacture things at home, using 3D printers, then manufacturing will be as flexible and portable as software startups nowadays.

The exam takes place once each year. If student scores are high enough, they might be able to enter one of the few high-ranking Chinese universities in big cities like Beijing or Shanghai. This builds the foundation for good jobs after graduation. And if their English is good enough, they can take the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) or the IELTS (International English Language Teaching System, or the British equivalent of the TOEFL). And last, if their families are financially blessed, they might have a chance to apply to colleges in English-speaking countries such as the USA, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, or New Zealand.<p>Unfortunately, if their entrance examination scores are below a certain point, the options after high school are limited to obtaining associates degrees or starting in extremely low-paying jobs.<p>For most Chinese students, the only way to a brighter future is to ace every subject in school and to be in extraordinary condition on the three days of the National College Entrance Examination...<p>Many American students find it hard to understand the Chinese schedule.

The porter duff over operation is identical to whats used in browsers for regular painting of semitransparent layers (or as another example, Photoshops normal blend mode). If the below pixel A is entirely opaque, and the above pixel B has opacity P, then the color of each pixel can be computed as (1 - P) * A + P * B. If however you apply a global alpha to the below image beforehand, you get something that isnt a cross-fade at all, and in fact isnt even fully opaque.<p>[edit: When I think about this a bit more, there is one time when cross-fade is useful: For cross-fading between two semitransparent images. In that case though, whats wanted is not really a compositing operation at all, but rather a straight linear interpolation between the respective RGBA components of the two images.]<p>I dont at all believe that people working on the color and graphics aspects of web specs are sufficiently critical. In general, those aspects have been quite under-specced, and browser implementations have been incomplete and buggy.

In the the startup vernacular you always hear things like ""company X promises to be the Y killer"", and I really don't think ""kill"" in this context has any kind of mean-spirited undertones.  It's just business.  (Perhaps you'd like to make an etymological argument about the connotations of startup/business terminology being unnecessarily hateful, but that's irrelevant to the argument here).<p>As for your earlier point that disrupting Hollywood would mean replacing thousands of people with $30K jobs with hundreds with $150K jobs, that may very well be what happens.  But the same argument could be made of any industry that gets infused technology or new ideas.  Instead of taking such a reactionary approach and fighting to keep a seemingly dying industry alive just for the sake of the status quo, why not have a more productive discussion and think of real ways that the sometimes corrupt and, more importantly, no longer effective Hollywood model can be improved?  Whether or not it comes from a trendy new YC-funded startup, it certainly seems like it's coming.<p>Personally, I find the idea of technological growth to the point of a ""singularity"" in the coming decades pretty compelling, and I think one of the biggest challenges we as a society will face is maintaining employment rates as technology continues to make things more and more efficient.  Protecting those on the lower rungs in Hollywood and the music industry is certainly an important part of this.",1327179060

3494443,comment,3491542,3493272,1,0,ctwk,,,"The video game industry is indeed bigger than Hollywood but that doesn't mean that it cannot become any bigger to harm Hollywood. As long as the content is engaging and fun for viewers, it will eventually eat into Hollywood's revenue pie.<p>I believe that currently, in order to ""kill"" Hollywood, the first step is to shrink the role of the middlemen by enabling content creators to distribute and market their content effectively online. In fact, the internet has provided a great way to do just that (it is the perfect distribution and marketing channel)! All of us are constantly sharing and reproducing the content and this helps expose users with all sorts of content. Now if there is a startup which focuses on ""following"" and ""chasing"" the content and sell products related to the content itself, I believe that many users will buy the products that interest them. For instance, when we watch ""Mission Impossible"" we may be interested in the music tracks, the movie DVD, the clothes that the characters are wearing, toys & merchandises etc. If more products are being sold, this is a reflection of the quality of the content itself. Product companies would then want to sponsor and fund for quality content creators to carry on producing content. Apart from that such a platform may allow more quality content to be placed on Youtube where users are abundant!<p>The next step is to make content interactive. PG mention ""what are people going to do for fun in 20 years instead of what they do now?"" and I thought of the notion of having the viewers of the content to dictate the direction of the show and making the content engaging that it makes me feel like I am part of it. Currently in many games (esp rpg) I decide the route/path that the character follows and this leads to different game endings. This can be applied to movies as well. A movie can have 4 parts and after each part, the movie may request me to buy a certain choice (eg. the character has 3 roads to choose, which do you choose and this will dictate the progression of the story) or product (there are 3 guns to choose, buy 1 from your local store lol! and key in product keycode or something). This can tie in very well with the idea on paragraph 1 where product companies can help sponsor for the video production.<p>What do you think about these ideas? I am working on idea 1 and I would be keen for some feedback and would love for people to contribute to this startup. Hit me up!",1327176877

Things are not so black and white. A donation can be as much freedom of speech as can be bribery. What the FEC and related Acts that define it do is to draw (I hope) clear lines in the sand differentiating the two.<p>I'm well aware that people don't like it and I'm not sure why people are suddenly surprised by Dodd's attitude toward campaign donations. Politics are all about influence. Simply because he wished his donations affected politics in his way doesn't make it bribery in the legal sense of the term.<p>If anything is surprising to me, because I'm inherently cynical about the political process (some of my best friends work as Senate aides and analysts and have no shame telling me how truly depraved the creation of a bill can be; to them, PIPA was a third-tier issue destined to be lost in bureaucracy should it have passed) it's that SOPA/PIPA have been effectively killed precisely because many politicians aren't necessarily beholden to their donators, that influence from an outside party made a huge difference.<p>So really, this shouldn't be a question about this one thing that Dodd or any other lobbyist thinks about their money's influence (or lack thereof) on the political process. We should be questioning the nature of money in politics in general. Ike was right, and things have only gotten much, much more incestual since his farewell address.

Seems like the same thing to me -- what if the email application was more like that other silo, then you don't need 2 silos.<p>Finally, in the interest of full disclosure, it's probably fair to mention that you have been Amy Hoy's business partner in the past (not that this implies any dishonesty or discreditation of your point... just sayin').",1327176342

My first assumption when reading the headline was that an Apple lawyer told him that. A better headline would be something like:<p>""Palm CEO Told Jobs Anti-Poaching Pact 'Likely Illegal'""<p>In general, using the passive voice in a news context anonymizes the subjects of a particular story. In this case, the headline writer probably did so in order to make Jobs the only subject of the headline, but it hides very important information about the story.<p>You're probably thinking that the first sentence provides the information, but studies show that a large percentage of news readers read only the headline (I suspect that is especially true about news aggregators), and that there is a precipitous decline in readership in every sentence thereafter.<p>As a result, newswriters usually pay a lot of attention to making sure that headlines and article ledes have as much pertinent information as possible. As it should be.",1327176176

I think the main selling point is that you can install packages to customize it for your needs. For instance, I use Visual Studio as my main IDE, but it doesn&#x27;t have support for JSX files. I open up Atom, install a few packages, and I now can edit/lint/compile JSX with full syntax highlighting.",1431723572

There are acceptable alternatives besides Python too, but that would be my favorite. I don&#x27;t see why we need to invent a whole new scripting language for client-side execution on the web, the problems really aren&#x27;t that special.

Effective RL social circles work the same way.  I&#x27;m more of an interjecting quipsniper or a technical sidebarbarian, and I really rely on other people to carry the majority of a conversation.  If I were to hang out with a copy of myself, there would be no conversation to add zingers, counterpoints, and trivia to.<p>There&#x27;s only so much of that crap that other people can take before it gets annoying, so there&#x27;s not much use in adding two to the same party, unless they&#x27;re scripted, like Crow and Tom Servo.<p>Also, I have a theory of conversation that keys on conversational coefficients.  If a group of people are having a conversation, you add together their coefficients.  If the sum is one, you have a very natural, comfortable conversation.  If it is less than one, you experience some uncomfortable lulls.  If it is greater than one, some people get interrupted, can&#x27;t finish sharing their thoughts, or are excluded.  If the coefficient approaches two, separate simultaneous threads of conversation will form, and participants will spontaneously rearrange or split themselves between conversations so as to make each one have a coefficient sum as close to one as is possible.<p>People don&#x27;t have a fixed coefficient.  They can adjust it within a certain range, that is somewhat dependent on atmosphere and subject matter.  For instance, a lecturer who can teach an entire class without losing the attention of the audience can stretch up to 1.0 for conversations, but probably only for that one topic.  Someone who has trouble yielding conversational priority may have a lower limit somewhere above 0.5.  I suspect that most people can easily handle a range from  0.2 to 0.5.  But I max out at probably a 0.4, on very few topics, so my &quot;soul mate&quot; would need to be <i>much</i> more talkative than I am, not at the same level, because it would take at least three of me to have a good conversation.",1431723507

In other words, unthinkable.<p>I do not fly over people or property.  Software cannot make that decision for me.  And software certainly cannot restrict people buying a $300 quadcopter from flying it above a group of kids at the park or over a crowd elsewhere.  It is a simple matter of individual responsibility and consideration for the wellbeing of others.

This attitude also makes it when we do something like that, people are very critical and hoping for it to fail rather than helping to fix it, further exacerbating the problem. We have groups of people that want anything that benefits all to fail, and can&#x27;t wait until they do.<p>Looking back, even when they did large projects in the past there were companies involved that did most of the projects. The government just funds it across all because it is beneficial to many or all and it may not be a market investment now but will be long term. Many people got rich determining where the roads, rails and projects got made and fortunes were made. That is when people started caring, many projects in when there were economic benefits.  We also built up after WWI/WWII because the entire world was in ruin and we had an opportunity to get far ahead.  I am convinced that if that happened today, with our extreme views, that we would have just not built up after those wars and we would be living in a much different place, with much less business and economic opportunity. Rarely does a big project like this cause economic issues other than the initial cost but the long term it adds many times more worth.

They did have me sign a right to represent form for the job (which was a 9 month contract position at a company that starts with an I and ends with L) but i never did receive any follow up from them.<p>My concern is in situations like the above, the ONLY way such a recruiter can qualify you is based on value of your degree parameter.  Which means if the company you are applying for goes the traditional big-bizz HR approach, go get a degree in CS from a Brand-name institution.  Otherwise, focus your efforts on getting interviews with whomever your direct supervisor will be. That however, is easier said than done.",1431723021

This makes New York look worse than it would if individual incomes were used, because it, along with Northern California, has some of the lowest marriage rates in the country. Manhattan is actually better than most of the country at raising the individual incomes of poor girls. Marriage rates, too, are strongly affected by where children grow up.&quot;<p>But that seems to essentially invalidate broad swaths of the original article, instead of merely being mentioned in the last paragraph in regard to just two areas...<p>There are still probably some interesting outliers, but it looks like they&#x27;re not the ones discussed in the original.

But then I saw that it&#x27;s neighbor, Ventura County, is both 3 percentage points less likely to marry by 26 <i>and</i> has households making 7 percent more at age 26.

Sure, it&#x27;s a shame it&#x27;s proprietary - but it has a lot to offer, a few neat ideas, and makes for great, visual demos such as the ones featured in that talk. The fact that you can get cool things running in a few lines of code, like the 3D stack of edges, is appealing - I don&#x27;t think there are many languages out there that allow you to do things like this in a few lines of code, and with such flexibility.<p>(it is quite a shame that Wolfram always has to assert how great they are, how revolutionary it is, how they invented everything, how unlike anything else ever done before their work is. It&#x27;s off putting. Let your work speak for itself, and leave the meta comments out. But I digress.)<p>I like the &quot;tweet a program&quot; concept. One issue with kids growing up mostly on mobile phones is that it makes them less likely to try to see what&#x27;s inside and program it themselves. One solution some have attempted is to have IDEs directly running on tablets/phones, but those tend to be fairly clunky. Allowing people to experiment with computation in unconventional manners, e.g. over Twitter, strikes me as an interesting path.\nI had a similar project a couple years ago where you would tweet concise instructions to a bot that ran them into a virtual machine, for which the output was a 32x32 pixel image buffer and would get tweeted back to you. If you&#x27;ve played with forth salon or shadertoy, it&#x27;s the same idea but with a language optimized so as to get cool results in <140 characters. Sadly, like many of my other bots, Twitter shut it down.<p>But yeah, given their aspirations for education etc., some open source components would be nice. It strikes me as a great exploratory/prototyping language, although it&#x27;d probably be hard to maintain large codebases of it due to the fuzziness of the instructions and a certain opacity in the backend.<p>All that being said, the tail end of the talk (about immortality and the singularity and the box of trillion souls - basically, when the paragraphs don&#x27;t have code examples anymore) does fall into the standard techno-religious singularity crackpot speculation where things sound vaguely scientific - just enough to give them an air of credibility - but where the terms used are fuzzy and slippery enough to be manipulated into whatever direction the speaker wishes while maintaining an illusion of rigorous reasoning.",1431722947

Yet why in the world should bus drivers in Minneapolis pay Federal taxes in order to provide what amounts to a $600 subsidy per ticket on the 180,000 tickets that are sold annually on the Chicago-Los Angeles route? And the latter is only typical of most of the other routes outside the northeast corridor.<p>Obviously, there is no means test to get a $600 subsidy from Amtrak, or any other plausible criterion of public need. Like so much else which emanates from Washington, these Amtrak subsidies are distributed willy-nilly——in this case to retirees with enough time and money to see the country at leisure or to people with fear of flying who don’t wish to drive.",1431721328

The funding just needs to be strictly derived from user fees. If truckers can&#x27;t profitably transport goods when bearing the full cost of their activity, then what they were doing was an uneconomic waste of resources.<p>At the moment it&#x27;s something like $2K USD per household that gets dumped into road infrastructure, from general tax revenue <i>not</i> user fees like the gas tax. This is ridiculous. Modern tech makes toll roads not a big problem anymore. Most roads should be separately incorporated toll roads. There shouldn&#x27;t be a cent of general revenue public money going into the major roads.<p>Public funding for intercity passenger rail is equally ridiculous, at least in America. The financials simply don&#x27;t work and almost any route you can name would inevitably be a boondoggle. Even the NE corridor is pretty dicey. Rail only works with greater urban density than currently exists in the USA.

Statistically, it is \n    extremely unlikely that we will come across our\n    soulmate.\n</code></pre>\nFirst off, the notion of &quot;soulmate&quot; is bogus romantic nonsense, and the notion that the person most compatible with us is <i>just like us</i> is demonstrably false. My father and I were very similar to each other and fought and argued all the time, because we were both cantankerous, ornery and contrary.<p>My life-partner and I--who are as close to &quot;soulmates&quot; as anyone can be to that basically ridiculous idea--are very similar in some respects, very different in others. The areas where we complement each other are as important as the ones where we reinforce each other.<p>More importantly, the claim that there is some great unexplored mass of humanity where our &quot;soulmate&quot; lurks is bogus. There are only 5000 people in the world. Maybe fewer. If there were more we wouldn&#x27;t keep running into each other all the time.<p>That is, the number of people in our tribe is surprisingly small, and anyone who is sufficiently similar to us to answer the questions the same way is already almost certainly a member of it, so dipping into the pool of random strangers across the world is unlikely to improve the odds much in most cases, and citing an anecdote or three--which some people will be tempted to do--does not change this fact.

Like I said, I&#x27;m pro-train.  I just don&#x27;t think that subsidizing trains is a proper role for government.  If there is enough market demand to fund and support trains (or Interstate highways, or the Post Office, or whatever) then more power to them. If not, I don&#x27;t believe in propping them up through taxpayer funded subsidies.",1431720250

I&#x27;ve worked with Swing, MFC, SWT, Android, and iOS, and all of them are significantly more complicated than the DOM is.  They do function at a higher level of abstraction, and the two really nice things they give you are components and a sane layout system (solved by WebComponents and Flexbox, now if only all the major browser vendors would just adopt WebComponents...), but in general I&#x27;ve found that iOS development is about 1.5x-2x slower than web development and native Android development is about 3x slower, roughly on par with Swing or SWT.  MFC was a clusterfuck, I wouldn&#x27;t even go there.<p>The way frontend devs for other platforms deal with it is to specialize in the nuances of the platform and effectively build your app around the capabilities that Google/Apple/Microsoft/Sun provide.  That&#x27;s fine, and makes for a fairly uniform, polished experience if you have good devs, but it significantly restricts the set of apps you can build.  The reason web developers like developing for the web is because it doesn&#x27;t make you a sharecropper in Google/Apple/Microsoft&#x27;s world, while building a full-featured GUI framework into the browser would.",1431720216

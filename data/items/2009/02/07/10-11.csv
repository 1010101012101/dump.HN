It makes it easy to view large quantities of data on a single page, and doesn't make it a ""chore"" to browse through the site for stuff.<p>Your UI is really way too bloated. Cut down on all the ""web 2.0"" look, focus on what your customers <i>need</i> rather than making sure your design screams ""I'm a Web 2.0 Startup!""<p>Cut down on the graphics, the crazy whitespace.<p>Just my two cents.",1234002972

471033,comment,470798,470841,0,0,timr,,,"What infuriates me most about this situation is the implicit presumption that she deserves the home because she got there first.  She took out the biggest loan, therefore she deserves the property now, and we should forgive her debts so that she can stay.<p>I'm sure that Half Moon Bay would be a nice place to live.  Personally, I'd like a bit of land on the Colorado front range -- maybe something next to a creek, with a view of a beautiful valley.  The difference between this woman and myself, is that I <i>know</i> that I can't afford it.  So I think of my dream property, and work a little harder, save a little more, and hope that someday I'll be able to buy something that approximates what I desire.<p>Apparently, this woman missed that memo.  She went out, took a series of ridiculous loans, and now she's the ""owner"" of a bit of property that she never had any reasonable ability to afford.  And now that it's all gone pear shaped, she thinks that she should be allowed to stay.<p>Well, that's nonsense.  There are thousands of other people just like me, who have been saving and living responsibly for years to afford the things that these lunatics bid up into the stratosphere by taking out massive debts.  Now is the time for irresponsible people to suffer, and for the things that they ""purchased"" to come down in value to levels that the market of reasonable people can support.  We shouldn't rescue this woman simply because she was willing to take out the biggest loan in 2006 -- and right now, that's her only argument.",1234002804

I think your idea of initially targeting zip codes not covered by craigslist is good, but then your problem is marketing to thousands of local, semi-rural areas. Very tough...<p>Perhaps a way to break into the market would be to find an esoteric genre of items to trade with a very devoted user group - these people generate buzz for free. Then, when you have a group of users, slowly expand into more mainstream categories that have some relation to the original base. For example, you could start with car stereos and speakers, then slowly expand into other car parts, then into everything. I realize this may require shipping and isn't CL-like, so it may not be what you are looking for.<p>I think the most important thing for me that Craigslist is missing is user profiles of some sort. When I am going to drive 30 miles to some guy's house to pick up a widget, I would feel much more comfortable if other users said he was on the level and dependable.<p>Feature-wise, I'm unclear on what your site offers that Craigslist doesn't, other than a more web 2.0 interface. If anything, I think a simpler, quicker interface would be better for something like this.",1234001008

30507,comment,30341,30341,0,0,codeLullaby,,,"As of now, you cannot compare Flashlite and J2ME. Its almost like comparing Javascript with Java. Flashlite has very limited capabilities . Add to it the limited capabilities of a mobile device.<p>If your application want to access phone's file system(r/w), or want to access phone's camera, FlashLite alone wont help. [its only possible with a java or python wrapper]<p>From my personal experience Flashlite is most suited for making quick visual demos/prototypes [within hours]. <p>Right now Adobe is working on Flashlite 3.0 , which is expected to be the most robust release ever, complete with flv video support.<p>One great thing about flashlite is that, if you build and test on a single device, you can deploy it on ANY flashlite enabled device without any change[subject to some device factors like support for screensavers, wallpapers etc.].This  'build once, deploy anywhere concept ' is unheard of in J2ME development world.",1182778239

An enumeration like 'Latino/Hispanic teens, immigrant teens, ""burnouts,"" ""alternative kids,"" ""art fags,"" punks, emos, goths, gangstas, queer kids' lumps together categories that are closely related to social class (Hispanic), categories that have nothing to do with it (queer), and even some categories that may be associated with higher social strata (when did you last meet a working class art fag?)",1182778186

About a year ago when my alumni class started using ourdoings.com for class notes, I knew graphic design was lacking.  I was surprised by comments like ""the new format looks great.""  Then I figured out that by making the information/photos people wanted more accessible, they were more pleased by what they saw.<p>The design of ourdoings.com is relatively subtle, as most picture frames are, but back then it was even uglier than it is now.  Nevertheless, people look at what they're interested in.",1182777536
30502,comment,30490,30490,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""working class teens will reject hegemonic values because it's the only way to continue to be a part of the community that they live in. In other words, if you don't know that you will succeed if you make a run at jumping class, don't bother - you'll lose all of your friends and community in the process.""<p>This seems to apply to middle class entrepreneurs as well. Saying that you don't need a boss often gets interpreted as a big fuck-you by everyone else. (Same applies to not finishing college.)",1182777013

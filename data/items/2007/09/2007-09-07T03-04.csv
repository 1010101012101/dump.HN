51479,comment,51397,51457,0,0,Alex3917,,,"I'll check it out. To use organization behavior speak, I'd bet that culture is to knowledge workers what systemic design is to routinized labor. That being said, I think there is a lot more money to be made from designing systems than from designing culture for three reasons:<p>A) Everyone knows about the importance of corporate culture for knowledge workers. While different businesses might require different best practices, there is still going to be a lot of overlap between different companies with ""good"" cultures. WHEREAS few people know how to design efficient systems for routinized labor, and the systems will be very specific to the company. <p>B) Routinized labor scales much more, so creating good systems gives you a lot more leverage than creating good cultures.<p>C) Knowledge workers don't create wealth in predictable patterns. With the best culture all you can do is make it more likely that someone will create something of value. But with a good system you are actually increasing measurably increasing your yield, just like finding a better catalyst for a chemical equation.<p>edit: Of course this isn't to say that it isn't possible to design systems for knowledge work also. Public schools are an excellent example of this. (Although, strictly speaking, schools are designed to be like factories so maybe not.)",1189136823

The fact is, that is <i>exactly</i> the kinds of things that C excels at. Not 
just as a language, but as a required <i>mentality</i>. One of the great 
strengths of C is that it doesn't make you think of your program as 
anything high-level. It's what makes you apparently prefer other 
languages, but the thing is, from a git standpoint, ""high level"" is 
exactly the wrong thing. ""<p>and <p>""And if you want a fancier language, C++ is absolutely the worst one to 
choose. If you want real high-level, pick one that has true high-level 
features like garbage collection or a good system integration, rather than 
something that lacks both the sparseness and straightforwardness of C, 
<i>and</i> doesn't even have the high-level bindings to important concepts. <p>IOW, C++ is in that inconvenient spot where it doesn't help make things 
simple enough to be truly usable for prototyping or simple GUI 
programming, and yet isn't the lean system programming language that C is 
that actively encourags you to use simple and direct constructs.""",1189136658

51465,comment,51390,51438,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"First I just want to point out that there are many different levels of being rich.  I know PG said this in one of his essays somewhere, and I have said it on this forum too.  And it is true.  I know this isn't what you were asking in reply, but there are certainly different levels above Level 7 (in my original scheme) that are just higher levels of monetary attainment.  And that is what motivates some people to go from say Level 7 to Level 7a, i.e. they see 1M vs 10M vs 50M or whatever as different levels.<p>But if I understand your reply correctly, I think you are saying, what is beyond all those monetary levels?  That is, assume you reach a monetary level that is enough for you financially, what is beyond that?  (This is why I just stopped at Level 7 in my scheme btw.)  <p>Having achieved some degree of Level 7 myself, all I can say is that startups are what I like to do (at least for now).  I want to start all over again and climb up the Levels because each level is rewarding to me its own right.  A different project brings different users and solving different needs, and I guess I just like that.  So in this scheme, I guess I think of it sort of as a reset for myself; not a circle exactly, but a new path.  <p>Other things beyond Level 7 are charity, prestige/celebrity, and doing things with bigger impact.  Steve Jobs is obviously a celebrity, and I would assume he sees that as part of his success.  PG seems to be in the bigger things category, hoping that YC will really change the world in a big way.  Maybe he can jump in here and speak for himself though.  I remember an article on here a while back (but can't find it right now) about what people do after exit events.  It had these categories, but it was a little more thought out, if I recall correctly.  Maybe someone can provide that link.",1189135552

It's always amazed me that they can take relatively uneducated individuals and get them to turn out a hot meal every 90 seconds. <p>I'm convinced that the real money comes from designing good systems. I once heard that the reason McDonald's color codes the register buttons is so that even employees who are basically illiterate can hit the right button quickly and accurately. Brilliant. <p>The problem with being stuck in a system like McDonald's is that even though it makes the least skilled/productive people much more efficient, it also puts a cap at how efficient you can ultimately get. I suspect the most successful people are the ones that are able to recognize when they are trapped in someone else's system, especially if it's inefficient, and break out of it. <p>I suspect that's the key to success in entrepreneurship too, designing good systems.

Quite coincidental that of the hundreds of addresses, just the three that are used for Dropbox are receiving spam in the past few days.<p>The spam I'm receiving is the kind of spam that you attempt to send to a non-tech audience (obvious phishing is obvious). The addresses were harvested, not carefully picked by looking at other addresses I used with my domain. The word ""dropbox"" is not even in the spammed addresses; they were school addresses. I never publicly mentioned I even went to that school. It are also three variants on the school's name, incredible that they picked just these three to spam.",1362142796

5303992,comment,5302940,5302940,42,0,michaelochurch,,,"The real crime is that programmers have so little time for the exploratory work that the career <i>requires</i> that they have to do all of that off-hours.<p>Doctors can read medical journals and call it ""working time"". Most programmers have feces thrown at them if they're caught learning on the job. This is just something we have to suffer until we develop a stronger tribal identity and demand the conditions of a profession (including ethical rights and obligations that supersede immediate managerial authority).<p>Do surgeons spend 40 hours per week, 50 weeks per year, cutting open bodies? Of course not. No one would allow it. They work a full work-week, but they spend a lot of that time keeping current with the field. That's how professions are supposed to work. Your metered work obligation is ~15 hours per week, and the other 25-40 you spend keeping current, networking, and performing other off-meter, self-directed work that is important to you and the profession.<p>Now, hackathons. There are two things one should know about that. The first is that the association of programming with the night hours is a bit of cultural legacy. Forty years ago, when computing resources were shared and scarce, night was the only time you could get low-priority (exploratory) jobs to run. So the hobbyists (young people, usually with access through a connection or favor) did their work at night. Now, we have enough in the way of resources that people can work at any time. Some people are most productive between 6 and 10 in the morning. Others are best from 8 pm to midnight. Whatever works.<p>The second is that hackathons seem, in many organizations, to exist to recapture the college lifestyle for people who haven't realized yet that It's Gone Forever. The hackathon recreates the ""good old days"" (?) of the 3:00 am, caffeine-fueled coding fests to get that hard-ass final project to work. It's not terribly unhealthy when you're a college student and have that kind of schedule autonomy (you can crash for a week) but it's a <i>terrible</i> idea to mix that lifestyle with the 9-to-5 regular workday. Also, most final projects are Done, submitted for a grade, and never need to be looked at again. This isn't the case for real-world software.<p>I tend to see most company's 20%-time and hack-day programs as negative spaces that define anything programmers actually enjoy as ""not real work"" (because they can be tricked into doing it ""for free""). I can't even count the number of times I've seen people using 20%T programs to do things that, if they didn't have short-sighted imbeciles for managers, would just be regular-ol' working time.",1362142659

Even if the whole sequence isn't finalized until the initial bitcoin transfer is made (I only have the information provided on the site to go on...), it might be possible (for example) to strategically transfer/commit, at a known/manageable cost, but simply not play the hand (abandon the transfer) unless the payout is greater than your expenses, circumventing the game's long-run behavior entirely. We don't have server code to look at (github?), but we all have access to python's libraries and can seed our own PRNG after the transfer in order to evaluate the hand/sequence.",1362142597

But once you understand how it all works, you can do significant string manipulation with relatively little effort, while still retaining exceptional runtime performance and minimal memory usage.<p>That said, if you're the kind of person who doesn't understand pointers, there are numerous libraries out there that'll provide a variety of functions for working with arrays and strings more easily.

One very interesting use is to train an RBM with animations, and then use it generatively to create new animations - Hinton and one of his students, Graham Taylor, wrote a paper about it (<a href=""http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~hinton/csc2515/readings/nipsmocap.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~hinton/csc2515/readings/nipsmocap...</a> (PDF)). Imagine if it was expanded, so animators could train an RBM with a body of animation from a character, then simply specify ""go from here to here"" and the RBM would create an interstitial animation.

Our team came in 2nd out of 20 (actually, there was a 3 way tie for 2nd).<p>Most other teams had somewhere between 4 and 8 developers or related technical folks.  Our team had 1 - me.   I know other teams got mired in arguments about what version of Rails to use, which gems, and various other technical trivia, I had just me to answer to, and I got quite a lot done.  Other teams got a lot done too, no doubt, but one person just hacking with some non-dev minds to bounce ideas off of was just as effective - perhaps moreso - than a team of developers.<p>At the halfway point we chatted with another team.  I showed what we'd (I) had done, and one guy smirked some.  He then showed their system - a mobile app that did XYZ, had some neat features, and was pretty far along.  Someone on my team said ""but we've only got one developer"", and the guy changed his tune, and became visibly impressed in what I'd been able to build in... at that time, around 12 hours.  They'd had a team of, I think, 6 devs.<p>The point is not that I'm some super coder, but that focused concentration and time blocks with a handful of people <i>can</i> get a lot done quickly.",1362141758

However, when I see things like the template tag making it in to webkit, we are no longer treating it as a blackbox where we focus on inputs and outputs.

5303867,comment,5299910,5299910,1,0,soneca,,,"Great work! I've been working on the philanthropy sector for a few years now. This P2P donation system is very powerful and this particular model can scale very fast. But there are a few traps on the way, I hope I can help you see some of them.<p>The first trap is the self-sustainability one. See the comments, everyone loves that their money is going 100% to the patient, they are glad they can be 100% sure you are not frauds. But no one cares about how are you going to survive or how much money will you need to be active in 10 years, reaching hundreds times more patients. This, as I see it, is a problem of anchoring. If you are a non-profit, they anchor you on Mother Teresa, you should be a volunteer, have a vow of poverty, be a saint. Anything less than that, you are a simply a fraud, no middle ground, you only deserve the rocks. On the other side, if you a regular startup, aiming for profit, they anchor you on Gordon Gekko, so you just try to be cool and ""do no evil"" and that's it, they love you. That is the trap also of personalizing the donation. People donate more when they see a face, but then they only care about that face. If you go bankrupt in about a year, they don't care. They only care that THEY saved a life (they did, writing a check, painless, easy, they saved a life with a few clicks, not your hard work, they did) and blame you for not being competent enough. So, the trick is to keep the donation personal and transparent, while raising awareness in donors that your work is relevant (and tough, and expensive).<p>The other trap, is more a conceptual one. IMO P2P donations are a great tool to connect very different words. When you put a face on it, third world health problems are not just statitics from Gates Foundation reports, they are real problem for real people. This is a great change of empathy level for donors. The trap here is to let that be enough, and fade. As behavioral economics shows, a good action give ones self-indulgence enough to neglect further involvement. It is important to educate people about why this donation is necessary. Explain how big are the health system problems in the country of the patient, explain more about the local conditions of the patient's family, neighborhood, hospital and doctors. Explain why a ""cheap"" surgery is not already covered. Explain how things might be better in the future, explain how they might be worse. Educate donors so they understand the world we live in. It would be a great service and potentialize the social impact of Watsi.",1362139989

Reading about the near-by Roman city of Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulpia_Traiana_Sarmizegetusa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulpia_Traiana_Sarmizegetusa</a>) it's surprising to see that only 2 generations after the retreat of the Romans the local people would revert to living in sunken huts, oftentimes a stone's throw away from the ruined Roman villas. The same people probably also lost the art of writing, because in the case I'm reading about there are no written documents or stone-graves or anything that could attest to the fact that they knew how to write for more than 700 years.<p>The thought that this kind of things could happen again should be on the back of our minds. For example I'm a little bit worried that more and more information about our civilization is only stored in electronic format. It suffices for us not being able to produce electricity for like 2-3 weeks and all of this will get lost.",1362139564

Apologies for bringing it up again.<p>It appears there is some comfort for you in knowing that you at least are not alone in this.

749351,comment,749293,749293,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"I grew up very close in time and location to the settings of Hughes' 80's films.  Perhaps that's why they seemed so immediate to me.<p>Unrelated, more recently my father got to know Hughes, a bit.  I was never privy to those conversations, but I will say that my father is a very knowledgeable and intellectual person.  To the point where, entirely in good will, he can almost overwhelm you with both knowledge and carefully thought out insight on your topic of choice.  That Hughes chose to continue to have and even seek out, as chance allowed, conversations with him, impresses me of itself.  And I thank him, as it was a relationship that my father greatly enjoyed, as well.<p>RIP, Mr. Hughes.  We won't forget about you.",1249742671

My point was that the item said:<p>* Throw away the normal forms you learned in school<p>* Denormalize [...] whenever it makes a query faster.<p>I think that's bad advice as stated. As you imply, you have to know why the rules are there to know when to break them intelligently. I didn't get that message from the item as posted, rather that the author thought that NF had little value, which probably doesn't belong in a list of database tips and tricks.<p>[edit: format]",1249742530
749348,comment,749099,749099,0,0,DanielStraight,,,"I always thought that allowing customers to sit around was the coffee shop business model.<p>It's like Barnes & Noble versus previous bookstores. Barnes & Noble encourages you to sit down and read books you have no intention of buying. They're smart enough to know that if you're in the store for 2 hours at a time on a regular basis, you're going to buy SOMETHING. I buy a lot of stuff at Barnes & Noble even though Amazon is generally cheaper. I go there all the time because it's such a cool place to shop, and I buy stuff because I see it and I'm like, ""I WANT!""<p>Anyway, my impression was always that Starbucks and others had the same idea. If you let customers chill for a few hours, they're going to buy stuff. I know I do. If I'm going to sit and read or sit and use a laptop, I'll buy a good drink and some kind of snack. If I want to stay after I finish that, I'll buy something else.<p>I guess the problem is now customers aren't buying stuff, which sadly coffee shops are fighting in less-than-optimal ways. The problem is, I think, that there is no optimal way that coffee shop owners can do anything. Customers need to be reasonable and support the businesses that are giving them such a nice place to hang out and get online.",1249742480

749331,comment,749238,749238,0,0,BigZaphod,,,"I don't really see anything about this that suggests he can't actually program. The worst bit might be this:<p>""... if you ask me to sit down and code up a new application from scratch I will spend ten times longer than programmers who are much more junior than me.""<p>That doesn't sound so bad to me. It kind of implies that he can still get the job done, just more slowly than some others. I don't know if that should be a ""I can't program"" qualifier, though.<p>He must not think that his extra coding time adds any value to the process. In my case, I know I'm not always the fastest around, but I like to think that my code is better designed and easier to maintain than the average (* may or may not be true...) because I'm almost pathological about building my applications from small, self-contained components, never having the same logic exist in more than one place if at all possible, and perhaps most importantly, clean, clear and consistent naming conventions. That kind of stuff takes time but, IMO, improves overall quality in immeasurable ways. Speed isn't everything.",1249741222

He sold stamps behind the counter. You can hire people to do his job for 7 to 8 dollars per hour but because of Union/labor laws, he makes 50,000$. How is that for efficiency?</i><p>Were you aware of how long this particular employee had been working for the USPS?  Yeah, it's a little old-fashioned, but there is something to rewarding long-time and hard-working employees.  (Japan companies get the retirement concept oodles better than the US).  Maybe he'd long ago paid his dues as a carrier, and was simply happy to be working the last couple of years before his actual retirement.",1249740872

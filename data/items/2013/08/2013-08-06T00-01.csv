So you <i>can</i> tweak a few things and get a nice, snappy system out of Ubuntu. Here&#x27;s a start:<p><pre><code>  * install linux-image-xxxxxx-lowlatency;
  * boot it with idle=mwait intel_idle.max_cstate=3
  * #disable ipv6:
    net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1

    vm.vfs_cache_pressure = 50
  * install latest graphics drivers to support that 3d desktop monstrosity;
  * disable all desktop effects;

Do that, plus a few more tweaks, and you will have it out of Ubuntu. On a fast modern box your terminal window will finally stop lagging ;)",1375750637

I&#x27;d estimate that <20% of the space above the fold is useful content.<p>In addition, there are a number of polish issues that exacerbate the spammy feeling caused by what I described above.

Commute times are huge;<p>I&#x27;d actually like to see some numbers;  my gut would be that when you move the office more than 10 miles, your turnover goes through the roof for the next 6 months or so.<p>(the interesting thing about a commute is that especially for younger workers, it&#x27;s not always obvious how brutal the commute will be.   &quot;Oh yeah, half an hour each way, I can deal with it&quot;  -  6 months later?  your view is dramatically different, especially if you have been working long hours at the office.)   So yeah, moving the office, I mean, more than a few miles, is a huge deal and absolutely needs management involvement.  Potentially you could lose some really key people.<p>I&#x27;d argue that deciding, you know, about shit like carpet, on the other hand?   the only time that should move up the ladder is when it&#x27;s still a business run by &#x27;some guy&#x27;  - and even then, it needs to be a recognized bikeshed.<p>(the cube/office decision might also be worth the time.

There is so much more to programming and building a product than simply typing some magical symbols into an editor.  Sure, it&#x27;s a start, but once a product is built, deployed to production, and then has customers, it will need constant nurturing.  Databases get slow, hardware fails, logs fill up diskspace, and yet that&#x27;s only the tip of the iceberg in programming.  Stating you can learn to code in one month is nothing more than the &#x27;Teach Yourself $LANG in 24 Hours&quot; from yesteryear.  It minimizes the amount of skill and experience one needs to be a programmer and make $120,000 per year (which is still a lot of money).<p>OneMonthRails is a start, especially if you want to learn how to program, but I find it unethical to insinuate that one can land a $120k/yr job after 1 month of training.<p>For all my fellow Canadian compatriots, I read the marketing page of OneMonthRails and see visions of Tom Vu [1] trying to tell us about his guaranteed technique to becoming rich (later found out as the greater fool theory).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQNdi-fRExc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQNdi-fRExc</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory</a>",1375749767

Fact is: that stuff is there already. Component manufacturers literally have field application engineers who are just waiting to send you reference designs that use their products, if you&#x27;re working at the PCB & discrete parts level.<p>Hardware designs are already open in a way that can&#x27;t be matched by software - you can look at a product, take it apart, and :voila: - you have the design in a way that is far easier to grok than disassembling a closed binary. Many high end products have full schematic drawings included with the technician&#x27;s repair manual. Anything novel enough to be patented has mechanical drawings and a full description listed in the patent.<p>The only things you can&#x27;t take apart are ASICs and other computer chips. But BFD!? Any player in that space has to have hundreds of thousands just to prototype one, let alone rent time in an IC fab to make them. If you have that kind of money, there&#x27;s plenty of fab-specific IP floating around for your use at nominal prices.<p>Open source software is revolutionary because the incremental cost of duplicating bits is nearly zero. The same can&#x27;t be said for hardware. In fact - it&#x27;s worse. The smaller a player you are, the more expensive it is to duplicate a design. And it is a pain in the rear to duplicate designs if they&#x27;re at all pushing the envelope, since manufacturing tolerances and capabilities differ so much from outfit to outfit. Can you imagine the pain and suffering you&#x27;d go through porting software that relies heavily on compiler-specific directives? Well, it&#x27;s like that when you move from one factory to another.<p>Some Chinese outfits have met with success with open / copycat hardware. I&#x27;d argue that&#x27;s less a result of open reference designs and 3d printing and more of drastically reduced labor and part costs, all situated in a global hub of electronics manufacturing.",1375749353

The moon landing was faked. 9/11 was an inside job. The NSA is recording every American phone call.<p>But that&#x27;s not it at all. It&#x27;s not about <i>what</i> you theorize, it&#x27;s about <i>how</i>. A sane and considered theory that leads to a crazy-seeming conclusion is not a conspiracy. Similarly, an insane theory that leads to a correct conclusion is still a conspiracy theory.<p>Some examples. Saying that the moon landing was faked because the flag was &quot;fluttering&quot; and there are no stars in the photographs is a conspiracy theory. Saying that the moon landing may have been faked because, say, you managed to get ahold of a secret memo from JFK discussing the possibility of faking it, would not be a conspiracy theory.<p>Similarly, saying that the NSA is spying on everybody because of the testimony and documentation provided by a whistleblower is not a conspiracy theory. However, saying that the NSA is spying on everybody because all the numbers in your e-mail header add up to 666 is a conspiracy theory.<p>What it comes down to is how you interpret the evidence.

If you twist mundane things to build narratives that are not justified by the evidence, then it&#x27;s a conspiracy theory.<p>That is what&#x27;s happening with this story.

6164064,comment,6160337,6160337,37,0,robomartin,,,"You really have to make a distinction between who the subject of a lot of these studies are.  It is mostly young fresh-out-of-school (or still in school) guys (and gals).  They generally have very little life and business experience.  They are full of ideas and passion.  But few have had to endure difficult situations in their lives --personal or business.<p>If you take that profile and suggest that success as a solo founder is possible, well, you would be wrong.  The road to success is actually a mine field for most.  And these young entrepreneurs, for the most part, are simply not prepared to have a steady hand at the tiller in a storm.  So, yeah, that the probability for success goes up exponentially for teams is no surprise.  So long as everyone is pushing in the same direction reasonably well things move forward.  Add to that guidance and adult supervision (I don&#x27;t mean that in a derogatory sense at all) and it could and does work well.<p>Of course, there are lots of examples of teams that self-destructed as things got difficult.  I watched a documentary on indie game developers a while ago and that seemed to be a common theme:  As they started to get stuck in the mud that can be a never-ending project partners started to become enemies and things went from bad to ugly fast.<p>It is my firm conviction that a well-rounded, experienced solo founder does not need a co-founder in order to succeed.  You still have to hire good people to work with you, which is a fact regardless of how many founders might be at the top.<p>Outside of the tight-knit university-centric circles of places like SV, finding suitable co-founders is hard and fraught with problems.  And this is particularly true as you get older.  Everyone can get excited about launching a new business.  Few are willing to put it all on the line to make it go.  I&#x27;ve experienced this first-hand with friends.  When you finally say &quot;OK, let&#x27;s do it&quot; and start to discuss the reality of what&#x27;s expected from each founder things slow down very quickly.  That&#x27;s when &quot;we should do this together&quot; turns into &quot;Well, let me check with my wife&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t think I can put in the time&quot;.  The co-founder pool is smaller and smaller as you get older and/or accumulate responsibilities.<p>I&#x27;d be willing to bet that the vast majority of businesses in the world are started and run by solo founders.  I know a bunch of them.  I am talking about everything, from a mechanic&#x27;s shop to a software company.  Partnerships are far more difficult than marriages to get right and the consequences of failure can be just as dire, if not more.<p>A lot of these discussions on HN tend to be software-startup-centric.  There&#x27;s far more to the world than web and mobile software startups.  By comparison software startups are easy.  That&#x27;s why people can write these really amazing zen sounding introspective pieces with revelations on how they did this or that, failed and then did this or that, learned, pivoted, raised some money and eventually succeeded.  Try doing that with a self-funded (from savings, loans, credit cards, second mortgages  or all of the above) hardware startup, a restaurant or a dry cleaning business.  The phrase &quot;I&#x27;m all in&quot; comes to mind.  Most businesses cannot be built sipping latte&#x27;s at Starbucks while listening to cool tunes.

Many of the students had no previous computer experience that would prepare them for the topics, and were told by the recruiters that riches await in the fast-paced world of network administration! The unfortunate truth is that most of those students weren&#x27;t all that motivated. It wasn&#x27;t possible for me, as a teacher, to give them every real-world scenario I could (I was a working network admin at the time), but I did my best. If they weren&#x27;t motivated to study and to experiment on their own, they weren&#x27;t going to get much for their money. They&#x27;d pass the class but they weren&#x27;t going to pass Microsoft&#x27;s tests or qualify for many positions if they weren&#x27;t willing to go beyond the curriculum on their own time.<p>It seems to me that what Mattan is offering is no different than numerous other educational opportunities. Students will get out of it what they put into it. If they want to copy/paste his code and not ask themselves how it works, fiddle with it and see what happens, try to extend its functionality with their own ideas, then they probably weren&#x27;t cut out for programming anyway.

That is why the copy on our website addresses the audience as being the primary caregiver as opposed to the senior.<p>Most seniors won&#x27;t be looking at the website to learn more about the product, but we also wanted to make sure there was a way for them to read about it if they wanted to learn more, so we also have a brochure available that is addressed to them.<p>As for other products that are able to work outside - there really aren&#x27;t that many options available, and all of them are missing certain features that we have built into ours. The most popular systems being used today definitely are not capable of working outside (Philips Lifeline, Life Alert, etc.), and that is the primary market that we are targeting.

4166350,comment,4165497,4165497,1,0,relix,,,"I would like to expand on this bit:<p>> Once you know the techniques, youll be able to apply the same grammatical patterns and language techniques in every new language you learn.<p>Only to new languages in the same family.<p>> Its for this reason that, while Italian took me 3 or so months to master, Spanish took only 2 months and Portuguese took just a few weeks.<p>That will mostly be because Italian, Spanish and Portuguese are in a lot of ways quite similar. My Spanish friends understand Italian and vice versa, without having been educated in it. Being romance languages, they fit in the same family as French (which you'll also be able to learn quite easily now, although there's a bigger difference than between Italian/Spanish/Portuguese) - they all stem from Latin. For example Dutch, English and German are all part of the Germanic family of languages and once you know one, the others will be much easier, too.<p>The problem will be learning outside of families you know. For example the Finno-Ugric family (Finnish, Estonian, et al) will be very hard to learn since you won't be able to relate any of the words to stuff you already know, and the grammar is completely different. Knowing more languages won't help you, although knowing German might help you a little bit for Estonian if you're good at pattern-recognition.<p>Source: I know 4 languages from the Germanic and Romance families and am learning Estonian.",1340793955

But the point is you can't do that in a binding way without having the national governments cede sovereignty through constitutional amendments, which instantly causes public uproar.<p>E.g. under the UK constitution (yes, the UK has a constitution, it is just not codified in a single act) the UK Parliament is sovereign, to the extent that it can not even bind future parliaments.<p>So without tricky constitutional changes (particularly tricky because parliament has pretty much ""bootstrapped"" its own constitutional powers in the UK into a position were giving them away again will need to be very carefully structured to stand up in court) it is pretty much impossible to grant the EU parliament any real power.<p>This is part of why the current structure of the EU uses a web of treaties to bind the executives of the member states in various to seek the passage of local laws to implement EU directives, with convoluted measures to cajole the national legislatives to follow through. It's still not ironclad - plenty of directives languish in national parliaments for years before being implemented (or get implemented with inconsistent differences in different member countries) exactly because the EU has very few means to push it through - but it's a far stronger method than trying to tie the national parliaments with no constitutional support.",1340793890

4166338,comment,4165381,4166055,2,0,justindocanto,,,"Those are nice suggestions and all but I already see one way to abuse this script since it's in the public html folder and pretty much wide open to attack if you can gain access to it.<p>Let's say i see your site has timthumb and it hasn't been updated to the new, more secure, version. Perfect! I'll just use your timthumb to grab your htaccess file and see what folders your hiding. Alright so (theoretically) it looks like you're hiding it under /rj988fh4990j0jgggggf4f thinking I would never know! Clever name, but unfortunately that wasn't enough to stop me from finding it.<p>Next step, since timbthumb can write stuff to a cache folder, thanks to it's wonderful permissions and being able to run things using apache (which has access to your protecte folder)... I'll just copy and/or move your ""secret"" and ""protected"" bike folder into the cache folder using a quick php script i plugged into timthumb. Yay! Since Bike can be run pretty much anywhere you put it and just needs to be publically available to use it, now i'm in the clear and i can now access it at /cache/bike.<p>Who needs a shell script when you have timthumb and bike! Let's get SQLing!<p>Granted, this is not going to work for every site using bike since 1) not everybody uses timthumb and 2) a lot of people have updated it and/or have better security than this... but from my experience as a dev a lot of people who use timthumb have no effing clue what theyre doing and are vulernable to these kind of attacks. they know just enough to be dangerous. this app i feel would attract the same crowd who implement scripts like timthumb<p>Personally I dont think this should even exist in the public html folder. it puts you at more risk than it's use justifies.<p>Just to note, as I'm sure this will cross some people's minds... yes, i could gain access to somebodies database config file for say wordpress or joomla just as easy using timbthumb but those typicall dont have a built in interface that lets me run and store queries as i please =P<p>This app needs more security.<p>Update: i just realized i could probably edit the htaccess file if it was writable by apache, using timthumb, in order to disable the protection of the bike folder which would just make accessing it even easier. This just furthers my point that this app needs more security. Depending on 1 simple thing like protecting a folder using your htaccess file is like logging into an account with JUST a password (and no username, no handshake, no api key, no tokens, no nothing).",1340793705

4166329,comment,4164784,4165114,1,0,tluyben2,,,"A service company doesn't have  a big impact? That's relative I guess. The companies i'm talking about have a bigger impact than 99.99% of SV startups, simply because all of those won't survive and won't be employing many people and supporting many families. My previous services company (in which I still have stock and which exists now for about 20 years) has 400 employees, most with families, so that's supporting roughly 1600 people. That's more than your non services startup will ever do in general. It was also profitable from the start. As is my new one; we have been paying full management fees + salaries since day 1. And mostly anyone can copy it and there still won't be enough of them in the world.<p>I understand product companies and such are more interesting and scalable (I find that too) to investors and to get filthy rich, but they almost never succeed. You are not going to be the next Facebook or Google or probably even Yammer. If you do, kudos to you; however, like Facebook & Google you would not actually sell your company, so not relevant for this discussion. In the case of Yammer it is; it sucks ; your lining your own pockets and the world doesn't really improve long term probably (a lot of takeovers don't end very well for the original product/people anyway).<p>And that brings me to your last question; there is everything wrong with your goal of 'getting rich' if that's truly your goal. That's not a very popular opinion here and apparently misunderstood; I am rich (self made) and I want to get richer (because you cannot really run a company otherwise), but it's not near my life's goals and never was and never will be. I like what I do and always did, I have a great family, we all work in the businesses we run. We take time off, we enjoy ourselves, but we like working with our colleagues on great things. The buzz of opening a new office this week is enough for me to jump out of bed every morning. I don't see how more money can change that; I could've stopped working many years ago and I don't have to worry for the rest of my life anyway. How is that interesting though? I will never stop working anyway, because I <i>like</i> it. And I like starting up organically more than running the company, so how is a lot of money going to change that 'hobby'?<p>I believe that you have a different main goal in life as well, otherwise you probably wouldn't be successful, money as 'goal' doesn't usually seem to work. I probably also assume wrong that you would retire when you make that $100 million in your account (ie I don't understand the obsession with getting rich other then comfort & ease to do what you like, but you don't need that much more for that). We probably think the same more or less anyway seeing your profile on LinkedIn.",1340793469

In a black box, there will be less orders because market participants are discouraged to be market makers, because the point their orders have been triggered is also likely the point the market deviates significantly and they have no chance to cancel or stop loss immediately in a non-continuous market. Market makers are resistance of such manipulation. And most market makers place orders to fill the ""gaps"" in the order book. Without a visible order book, it's much more risky to provide liquidity without any actual demand or supply for the shares. I think it's okay to assume that less than 1% of traders place orders based on real supply and demand. You know you would sell AAPL if it spikes to $700 today, but you won't place an order until that happens.

That's what I had been thinking the whole time while reading the articles and the comment threads. This is also my motto, here in the office.<p>It's too simple to say that there are differences between writers and programmers. I think ""writer"" should be treated as an umbrella term that encompasses braod ranges of skills. After all, a journalist, a poet, a technical writer and a translator aren't really doing the same thing, are they? I like to believe that the core subset of skills needed to be one of these is also needed (or at least highly valued) to be a good programmer.<p>Programming is writing. Absolutely.",1340791841

It is a great marketing tool to get people talking about your brand.<p>Tweet-a-lot works through gamification of twitter, getting people incredibly competitive.<p>Users receive points for different types of Twitter posts, and a score board is displayed on the tweet-a-lot competition page. Users have to keep tweeting to stay at the top of  the score board. As simple as that.<p>Everything runs in real-time, players are scored live and there is a twitter stream to watch the game.<p>Tweet-a-lot includes automatic player discovery. Users who are unaware of the competition are drawn into playing. When they tweet with the competition hashtag, they receive @replys with their score and URL to the competition page.<p>The best part? Your users do not need to install anything or even register to play; they can play using their favourite Twitter client.<p>You can join the example competition by tweeting with #tweetalotapp hastag.

The first year was 60+ applications, the second was less than 10 if I remember correctly.  All of that resulted in 7 interviews, 1 offer that I didn't end up accepting, and a whole lot of rejections.<p>My advice to anyone applying out for faculty jobs is just to expect a ton of rejections.  I stopped reading the letters/emails after I knew they were rejections.  Reading more doesn't do any good and it's not like it is a personal letter anyways.  One of the things that made it easier was that I was once involved in a faculty job search.  400-500 applications were whittled down to about ~40 that looked good.  The process of whittling those down to the 7-8 we interviewed seemed very arbitrary; many of those we didn't interview looked very good.  After the interviews, you could have made clear arguments for a few candidates.  In the end, one got an offer.  So, after seeing the number of applications involved, and the randomness involved in the process, it's pretty easy to just know there will be a lot of rejections.",1340791355

A chart library that follows anything from Edward Tufte should allow a user to make the chart as simple as they require it.<p>If a user has 10 series, and disables all but 1 to look at it and then decide to look at another in isolation, he would, in his naivety as a user, perhaps disable the one he's looking at before enabling the one he wishes to look at.  After-all, he's looking at one at a time, so having two on at once could seem wrong to him for his current process.  Disabling that one isn't disabled, nor does it blank the chart.  Instead it does something completely unexpected, and is in no way predictable.  It enables all 10 series again.<p>If you're designing a charting library that you want to be usable then it should follow user expectation.  And no user will expect that turning off all series will in fact re-enable them all.  It would make more sense to disable turning off all the series and requiring one on at any one time.",1340791295

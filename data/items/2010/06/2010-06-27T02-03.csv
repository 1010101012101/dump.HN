Of course, there's the predictions that are laughable now:<p>>We are involved in a new generation of fax machines that we think will be better and easier to use. And a generation of screen phones [a standard phone with a minicomputer] in which the typically cryptic buttons are replaced with a graphics interface. And in the home environment, something you can carry in your pocket called the Wallet PC.<p>>PLAYBOY: In your pocket?<p>>GATES: It's a futuristic device unlike today's personal digital assistants.<p>But it also shows the human side of Gates (his family nickname is Trey) and how really intelligent and quick he is. A lot of clueless people think he's just a corporate raider, incomparable to Jobs, they're quite wrong. I've heard many stories from my friends at Microsoft about him interacting directly with engineers, asking very sport on questions. Believe me, this kind of thing is rare in some other tech companies, where MBA types rule. Not many people could have handles an interview like this one.<p>I also remembered once again how good the articles and fiction on Playboy used to be. Yea, yea, ""I read it for the articles"" is a common joke, but do you realize that many top writers, including Oates, Updike, Nabokov, and (this seemed incredible) Borges have published stories there?",1277607291

Oaxaca, Mexico - I lived there for a year while working on a startup and loved every minute.  It's really cheap (my wife and I spent about $1100 a month in total, and had a great lifestyle). It's a beautiful city, with lots to do, and is close to some great hiking and only about 5 hours from gorgeous beaches. It's also very safe these days. The drawback is being completely isolated from the tech community.<p>2. Missoula, Montana - This is a great little college town about 3 hours away from where I grew up.  I stayed a couple of nights there in 2008 and was blown away by how much it had changed in the time I had been gone.  It's super cheap, gorgeous (great hiking, skiing, biking is all around you), the people are genuinely friendly and laid back, and there are great micro-breweries and pubs everywhere. Again, the drawback is being isolated from the tech community.<p>I hope you find what you're looking for.",1277607054

[(a, b) for a in as for b in bs] is a cartesian product and not a zip? Really?<p>Strange.  I would say it sucked if it was the other way round.  You can use the `zip' function, if you want a zip.<p><pre><code>  zip (as, bs)

> 3. Loops don't help this either: There's no equivalent of the Lisp (loop for x in xs for y in ys do (stuff x y)). I have to explicitly loop over the index. This pisses me off.<p>Try the function `enumerate' and `zip'.  E.g.<p><pre><code>  for x,y in zip(xs, ys): stuff (x,y)

If you need an explicit index for your stuff:<p><pre><code>  for (i, (x,y)) in zip(xs, ys): stuff (x,y)

> 4. I feel that I am generally shoehorned into creating and assigning more objects than I would like.<p>I agree, only the other way around.  Python is much too destructive and relies on in-place updating.  E.g. recently we got `sorted' that doesn't sort in-place but return a sorted array --- but the `shuffle' function still works only in-place.  Also dicts are destructive.  There should be a persistent (i.e. non-ephemeral) data structure for key-value-mappings in the standard library.",1277606847

They basically killed any chance of a competing OS in the PC world (4DOS, Quarterdeck, BeOS, Unix, OS/2).  The US govt eventually forced them to stop this practice, but it was too late by then.  Competition all dead.<p>Another example, they built the browser into the operating system, thus killing of Netscape.  Once they did that they let IE stagnate for several years, providing no innovation (IE6 is 2001).  We are finally crawling out of that hole.  IE9 is going to be good because it has competition and Microsoft now must compete or see further erosion in their browser market share.<p>In short, because Microsoft has a desktop monopoly (90% for 15 years), and they've used it aggressively, they make people a bit unhappy.  Personally, I don't care if people choose to use Windows, but many people don't want to, yet they must because of ""corporate standards.""<p>The only other thing that bugs me is people always want the govt to look into Apple and Google.

1464725,comment,1464564,1464684,0,0,CapitalistCartr,,,"You might be too young to remember the days when MS ruled with an iron fist.  When they got IBM to use their DOS, they structured the licensing so that the only affordable one was to pay MS for every box that went out the door, no matter which OS was on it.  So a shop could either sell only MS-DOS, or not offer it at all, and any shop that didn't offer it couldn't stay in business, once IBM ""approved"" of MS-DOS.<p>When they came out with any software, they chose the most confusing name possible.  ""Windows"" was a generic term for any the panes in windowing GUI, until MS appropriated the word.  Then came ""Word"", which sounded like about all the competition out there.  Once they had the OS market sewn up, they used that to make their other software work better than anyone elses, with undocumented APIs.  Then they offered ""bundles"" which meant, if you used their OS, which of course every business had to, you couldn't afford to turn down their other offerings.  This might sound like fair, tough competition, but the reality was that they used their money and clout to run the competition out of business, then  their de facto monopoly to make a fortune.<p>And tough but fair, often gave way to threats.  If a retailer didn't play ball, getting rid of competition, they would pull their joint marketing/advertising deals.  If a small business came up with anything interesting, they'd swallow it, or run it out of business by any means necessary.  This did more to stifle innovation for about 15 years than anything else.<p>This is only the beginning of why people don't like MS.

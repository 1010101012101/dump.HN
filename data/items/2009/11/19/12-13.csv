I don't believe that any ""evangelist"" including me, could convince a developer to use a technology just because we say nice things about it.<p>Xobni, a Y Combinator company, is a good example. They chose to build on Microsoft long before I came along. But, once we connected I was able to help them get access to software, technical support, consulting, and lots of PR and exposure to MSFT, the press, VCs, etc.<p>I am not a ""marketing"" or PR guy. I help startups and developers get things done, get them help when they ask, etc.<p>In my post I highlighted some of the things I noticed about the Google alternatives. I don't think I went al the way to say Google is better in every case and those Microsoft products are bad. If I left that impression I am sorry.<p>There are lots of choices. No one tool or product will be the best in all possible use cases. Work loads and requirements are different, and the choice of tool or platform can vary.

The appeal of a single language, I guess, is that you only need to learn one language and you can work on all problems. Then again, if you have good support for macros and other such ""niceties"" then you can remold the language to be domain specific anyway, so I think having a single super language isn't so far fetched and is actually not a bad idea really.",1258632747

We have friends with young kids who have been through interview processes for preschool.  Other friends have complained about the academics in their kids' preschool, or kindergarten (academics in kindergarten?  Really?  I recall playing and napping, and maybe learning the alphabet.)  Many parents are concerned with preparing their kids for college while still in grade school, and the in many cases, it is likely the schools caving to the pressures of parents--they feel without homework, their kids won't be properly prepared.<p>That said, I don't think this is universal.  We have friends who teach at smaller private schools that follow a more classical education model, and their students generally aren't required to do large amounts of homework.",1258632152

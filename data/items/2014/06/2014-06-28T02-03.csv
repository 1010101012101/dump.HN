Hanauer fears mobs heading for the castles of Greenwich and Palo Alto, but America’s disaffected these days are more likely to vent their rage behind closed doors as they shake their fists at Fox News or MSNBC and leave cranky<p>They are docile, that is true. Slavoj Zizek, which is a madman, pop-psychologist,  and I often don&#x27;t agree with, did say something I agree with in one of this talks and that is the tyranny of democracy. Basically the idea that people are managed, treated and groomed ideologically to vote against their own interests. At the end of the day the system on paper is democratic and people believe they are free and have all the possible choices available to them, people can vote, can impeach, recall senators etc etc. Yet so many end up voting against their own interests. In a certain way he makes the case that countries with officially un-free speech and human right have healthier people (psychologically speaking) because everyone knows that they are not free and often they internalize and understand what they are giving up in exchange for security, bread and shelter.<p>I think it is very instructive to watch or talk to people who watch Fox News or any conservative show, or perhaps just as likely an another ideological show (leftist or liberal too) and observe how propaganda works. Once you start seeing through it it becomes comical and amusing. But one man&#x27;s comedy and theater is another man&#x27;s reality.<p>Another anecdote came from Chomsky, I think, and it was about how those in power (and this doesn&#x27;t have to be just money it could be power to regulate or control or police etc) are devout closeted Marxists. Well how so, a lot of them a on the complete opposite spectrum usually? Well the twist is instead of identifying with the working class they just identify with the ruling class and act accordingly -- protect their interests, they understand what owning the means of production is, understand how the labor market works and exploit it, they lobby for legislation in their favor, privatize sectors of what used to be owned and managed by the government -- prisons, etc etc. All of that has to be done concurrently with maintaining ideological control over people.",1403924383
7957299,comment,7956627,7957205,24,0,cdsmith,,,"Basically, the difference is that in a functional programming language, words like &quot;variable&quot; and &quot;function&quot; have the same meaning they do in mathematics.<p>In C or Python, a &quot;variable&quot; is a storage location in which you can place different values at different times.  This is completely different from mathematics, where &quot;x&quot; doesn&#x27;t equal something different just because you progress to the next step of computation.  (But &quot;x&quot; might refer to something different in a different <i>context</i>, such as when evaluating a function with a different argument; that&#x27;s the sense in which it varies.)<p>Similarly, in mathematics, there&#x27;s no such thing as a function that returns something different each time you evaluate it, or that gives one result on Wednesday but a different result on Friday, or that even gives no result at all but causes letters to appear on a nearby computer screen.  Yet in C or Python, all of these things are called functions.<p>At first, it might seem surprising that you can do much programming without the C or Python version of functions and variables.  But:<p>1. You can do more than you think without reassigning variables or using functions that aren&#x27;t &quot;real&quot; functions in the sense of mathematics, and<p>2. Of course, in the end, all languages - including functional languages - do have a way to create boxes to store values over time, or to perform actions that make things appear on computer screens.  It&#x27;s just that in a functional language, these things are not the basic bread and butter tools of programming to the extent that they are in C or Python.  So you have variables and functions (in the mathematical sense), and you <i>also</i> have other things that act like storage locations and actions, but you only use the latter when you have a real need for them.<p>That&#x27;s the general character of the difference.  There is, of course, a lot of detail that I am leaving out in a response on a web site.<p>The reason people were speculating about whether this would work better with people not yet accustomed to programming is that it&#x27;s often thought that experience in an imperative language (like C or Python) leads you to naturally try to do things with actions and storage locations, even when it&#x27;s not necessary... and then it can get frustrating and confusing to work in a language where most things are actually <i>not</i> done that way.  There&#x27;s a theory that says if you maybe learned the functional way first, you wouldn&#x27;t find it as frustrating.<p>I&#x27;m of two minds about that.  I spent a year teaching Haskell with this system (I&#x27;m the Chris Smith mentioned in the article), and I found that it&#x27;s partly true that students don&#x27;t get as frustrated... sometimes.  But there are other cases where students naturally fall into trying to do things in imperative ways, despite not having past experience in a programming language.  I actually think, computer programming aside, that this is one of the things that trip up kids in math classes.  So it&#x27;s not just programming languages where this comes up: a lot of teachers present math as step-by-step processes, as well.  Essentially, they introduce imperative programming without the computer.  This is what happens when teachers tell students that parentheses are about what to do &quot;first&quot;, instead of about which sub-expressions are meaningful on their own.  Partly, I think this is just how the human mind works, too, and it&#x27;s an inherent tendency that we have to overcome to really &quot;get&quot; algebra and other mathematics in a deeper sense than knowing how to do specific problems.  It&#x27;s still frustrating, then, for kids to adapt to having to describe processes using equations and expressions, which at their core do <i>not</i> list things to do, but instead describe and state facts about relationships between quantities.<p>I still think it&#x27;s an important skill to learn.  Indeed, I&#x27;m a lot more interested in teaching that kind of reasoning than I am about teaching computer programming.  That&#x27;s why I made changes in the new CodeWorld (the site discussed in this article) that are designed to deliberately thwart students who try to think of their programs as sequences of actions, and encourage those who think in terms of compositional expressions.",1403924382

A lot of good points. I agree with some of them and don&#x27;t agree with other parts of it.<p>First, let&#x27;s start with this basic principle -- &quot;customers don&#x27;t care if I have 1M unit tests or 0 unit tests&quot;. They just don&#x27;t. They will complain and not like my product if it keeps crashing or is showing other pathological behavior. First and foremost it is important to ship, and to ship working code as far as customers are concerned. Taken from that side, I want to ensure that when the system is setup in customer&#x27;s configuration (and we do know it, in our line of work), then we want to stimulate the system as close as possible to what a customer would do. If that doesn&#x27;t break and is behavior properly. We gain immediately a large degree of confidence because it is closer to &quot;doesn&#x27;t break when customer uses&quot; use case.<p>Unit tests also promise that, and they would also promise that &quot;if I have unit-tested my code well, there is a higher chance that the code will not break when it gets into customers&#x27; hands&quot;.  However notice that this is further from being true than the first one.<p>The problem with integration tests as discussed in the talk it they take a long time to run and give imprecise results. When something is broken I might not be able to quickly zoom in on it. I can&#x27;t experiment as often as I would like because it take too long to discover precise mistakes. And I agree with those, but, I still maintain it is better to have integration tests because once you get into a stable steady state and all of the sudden one commit breaks the tests it usually is pretty clear what broke, in the worst case just revert the commit or examine in detail until it works. That helps with the &quot;I don&#x27;t know what broke, something did&quot; part. Usually that something is the one commit where tests started failing.<p>Yeah, it would be better to also have complete 100% unit test coverage as well and zoom in immediately on the problem. No doubt that 100% unit test coverage also costs a lot of time and money and I posit it is often un-necessary.<p>Another criticism, perhaps I misunderstood the presenter, it seems to me that the talk focuses more on machine-local, object oriented code. Today the systems are more and more distributed. In a pure, local, single threaded, object oriented code (say a 3D modeler or Photoshop).The behavior or objects is more predictable and it is easier to write what he calls &quot;focused tests&quot;. Now introduce threads and well that starts to become hairy.  Add in multiple machines (a distributed system) and it gets even more complicated. There is a whole slew of strange problems. Often involving consistency, timeouts, networks failure, partitions, hardware peculiarities. Un-expected input that is generated maybe because a front end service is broken and back-end write might never expect that case and crashes. Unit tests will catch basic errors but it will mask those harder to find those kind of errors.<p>One more criticism is psychological and it is the false sense of security. And I have seen this happen from those that advocate unit testing everything 100%,  when their code breaks, they simply don&#x27;t believe their code could break because it has 100% coverage and they &quot;just ran it and it passed&quot;.  Well in production it crashes. And customers don&#x27;t pay for passing tests they pay for a working product. Anyway I am repeating myself at this point and this is longer rant, so, sorry about that.",1403922826

What everyone wants to believe is that when things reach a tipping point and go from being merely crappy for the masses to dangerous and socially destabilizing, that we’re somehow going to know about that shift ahead of time. Any student of history knows that’s not the way it happens. Revolutions, like bankruptcies, come gradually, and then suddenly. One day, somebody sets himself on fire, then thousands of people are in the streets, and before you know it, the country is burning. And then there’s no time for us to get to the airport and jump on our Gulfstream Vs and fly to New Zealand. That’s the way it always happens. If inequality keeps rising as it has been, eventually it will happen. We will not be able to predict when, and it will be terrible—for everybody. But especially for us.",1403922330

At least Apple uses Cocoa for all its OSX Desktop apps which I find to be of much higher quality and smoother performance.<p>WPF is used for Visual Studio, and that is from VS 2010 on. WPF is used for a lot of stuff internally, its not like people are still breaking out WinForms or GDI. And then there is WP and WinRT, which are WPF derivatives.<p>> You&#x27;re making it sound most developers using text editors are old kooks with 1-foot into retirement. How disconnected are you? What % of OSS projects on GitHub do you think use an IDE? More or less than 50%? <a href=""https://github.com/trending"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/trending</a><p>GitHUB isn&#x27;t even a small percentage of all developers, it only represents public OSS projects. There is lots of value in a good IDE, language designers and implementors who treat it as a second class concerns are going to pay the price in popularity eventually.<p>> They actually have quite a few IDE people on the team with many years of experience developing IDE tooling. Any immaturity is simply that the DartEditor is still so young.<p>That isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;ve heard. Anyways...Eclipse...wow...I don&#x27;t see anything good coming out of that.<p>> It was only recently that they rewrote the old Analyzer that was previously written in Java to Dart, which now runs much faster.<p>Fast tools mean nothing if the UX is crap. Also, incremental performance is quite different from batch performance that you expect from the command line.<p>> Running inside Parallels likely accounts for about 10-15% performance overhead, it doesn&#x27;t explain 2.3x worst performance.<p>In general, I&#x27;ve seen the CLR beat Mono anywhere from 1.5 to 3X. So if Mono is coming up faster than the CLR, something is probably seriously off.<p>> Language VM features that are optimal for compiler writers doesn&#x27;t translate itself into killer general-purpose language features.<p>Right. But it does give you lots of options in one&#x27;s managed time live programming language.",1403921196
7957186,comment,7955734,7956946,2,0,sheepmullet,,,"&quot;There are varying degrees of consequences for lying about these - typically, lying about your salary gets at most a little distrust&quot;<p>Because it is an incredibly gray area. For example I currently get 6 weeks annual leave and very generous medical. If I&#x27;m applying at a place that only offers 2 weeks annual leave and limited medical then when they ask my current salary I&#x27;m going to add these benefits based on their equivalent cash value.<p>For example I earn ~$2k/wk and so the extra annual leave is worth $8k/year. And to get the equivalent medical would cost me around $10k/year. So I&#x27;m going to happily add $18k to my current salary.<p>Likewise I don&#x27;t feel it is unethical to adjust for cost of living differences between countries and cities. For example if moving to San Francisco for work I would need to be paid about 20% more just to maintain my current income.<p>I don&#x27;t think talking in purchasing power instead of nominal is unethical.

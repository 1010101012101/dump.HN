6996610,comment,6995770,6996484,3,0,apricot7,,,"Of course. The full quote from the study:<p>-----<p>Sex differences in juvenile activities, such as rough and tumble play, peer preferences, and infant interest, share similarities in humans and monkeys. Thus if activity preferences shape toy preferences, male and female monkeys may show toy preferences similar to those seen in boys and girls.<p>We compared the interactions of 34 rhesus monkeys, living within a 135 monkey troop, with human wheeled toys and plush toys. Male monkeys, like boys, showed consistent and strong preferences for wheeled toys, while female monkeys, like girls, showed greater variability in preferences. Thus, the magnitude of preference for wheeled over plush toys differed significantly between males and females. The similarities to human findings demonstrate that such preferences can develop without explicit gendered socialization.<p>-----<p>Male monkeys preferred roughhousing and toys that developed their spatial intelligence. Compared to boys, female monkeys preferred dolls that developed other forms of intelligence.<p><i>Gender differences vary widely by culture. Stuff like gender differences in IQ is wholly inconsistent across different racial groups.</i><p>Interesting. I can&#x27;t really find anything on this, and Wikipedia doesn&#x27;t have anything either:<p><a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_human_psychology#I"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_human_psycho...</a><p>Are you referring to a study about a village where women were able to solve a puzzle faster than men?<p><i>For instance in some countries it&#x27;s women who test better in math.</i><p>This would be shocking if it <i>weren&#x27;t</i> true.<p>I&#x27;m curious to here what countries those are, because I suspect the countries that women test better in math will be the same countries that spend a disproportionate amount of time and money trying to improve women&#x27;s math scores.<p>A possibly relevant example: Men and boys tend to have better spacial intelligence than women and girls. But as an Israeli (I think) study showed us, spending extra time instructing students how to pass a specific type of spatial intelligence test resulted in <i>everyone</i> doing well on those tests, not just the boys.",1388609946

What was its resolution?<p>--------------------<p>Reading it on a 27&quot; 2560x1440 display was really nice. Same in \nvertical mode on a 9.7&quot; iPad, but not so good in horizontal \nmode; it felt constricted like watching a letter-boxed 16:9 \nmovie on a 19&quot; 4:3 TV screen.<p>What I&#x27;ve found is that optimal text formatting varies greatly \nacross devices. This is very hard to design for due to the \nvariety of screens. From small screen devices like cell phones \nand gray-scale Kindle&#x27;s, through larger 24&quot; - 30&quot; monitors and \neven larger HDTV&#x27;s. On top of that there are DPI variances.<p>I&#x27;ve always been a fan of MVC, separating the model (actual \ndocument data/text/pictures) from the view (how it&#x27;s \ndisplayed), and using a controller (device/screen-specific \ncode) to display things optimally.<p>It would be nice if there was a standard that existed \nallowing authors to simply write documents, saving them as \nmodels. Then, each device could read from a standard model \nfile and, using custom controller code, generate a view \ndisplaying the text/images optimized for its display.<p>Right now you see web developers creating multiple CSS \nlayouts for different screen layouts. This works for most \ncases, but not edge scenarios. It feels very hacky, and I \ncan&#x27;t foresee people building websites/content-delivery-mechanisms \nlike this 10 years into the future. There must be a better way.",1388609404

You can vote for the shade of your representative, but you can&#x27;t vote against putting an invertebrate lizard in position of power. Adding a valid &quot;none of the above&quot; choice to the ballot would be a way to track just how big a fraction of population disagree with <i>ALL</i> of the available representative options.<p>Currently we lump &quot;invalid&quot; votes together with disqualified votes, so protest votes do not count.

We are currently raising a series A after closing a seed round and getting early traction. Things are going well and we are excited to be expanding the team! Not only are we a startup (the team went through Excelerate 2011, which is now Techstars Chicago) but we are working on a real problem that should help companies meet the rising consumer demand for healthier food options. What I love about posting this job on HN is it is a community of people who get excited about this kind of thing :)<p>You will be our first engineering hire (outside of myself) and will contribute to the website, the data collection tool, subscription reports and our auction platform. All are currently Rails, with a live trading platform under development that is Erlang/Elixir. The front end relies on jQuery and some graphing libraries. The code is ripe for some refactoring (don&#x27;t worry, it isn&#x27;t awful, but we pursued a few directions that we did not end up going in). You will have a large degree of flexibility to add functionality, clean things up, upgrade libraries, etc. with the strong caveat that you must write tests to make sure that you don&#x27;t break anything and that you test browser compatibility. Ideally you should have enough experience to be able to contribute immediately but not so much as to be bored. Some other potentially interesting projects that will need to be tackled include a more robust testing suite and continuous integration.<p>I work out of a combination of 1871 and from home, so schedule will be flexible. I like to provide a fair degree of autonomy, but that only works with a large degree of communication. We use Asana to track tasks and email/phone/in person meetings to ask questions, discuss features, etc.<p>Salary will be dependent on experience. Options, 401k and health insurance are also part of the compensation package.<p>If this sounds interesting, please send me a note to chris at mercariscompany.com and let&#x27;s talk.

However, I&#x27;m not suggesting it for productivity, but for satisfaction. The satisfaction of completely something. Of climbing the mountain, completing the quest, bringing the elixir back, solving the problem, creating something new. I&#x27;m not saying one &quot;should&quot; do it, I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s a way to feel satisfaction, instead of pain.<p>The key idea here is that a goal not something to strive for, but a limit. Not to force you on, but to let know when you have accomplished something - when to stop! Now, if you&#x27;re a perfectionist, you may say, &quot;but there&#x27;s so much more! I&#x27;ve barely scratched the surface. I&#x27;ve done <i>nothing</i>! <i>I&#x27;m not worthy!</i>&quot;<p>However, if you had a goal, and you can remember how it looked when you set it (that it did seem challenging), then when you reach it, you can compare where you were, and where you are now. And you are forced to acknowledge the fact that you <i>have</i> accomplished something.<p>This gives a flood of satisfaction, like it or not.<p>Now, turning to &quot;sprint&quot; vs. &quot;system&quot;. Firstly, I stressed that the goal must be doable. There&#x27;s minimal risk that you can&#x27;t complete it, if it is  &quot;doable&quot;. And if it&#x27;s too hard, pick a smaller one.<p>Note also that you can shift topics between goals, just as you can with a system. I&#x27;m talking about small goals, not huge overreaching ambitious goals. Baby steps - but steps nonetheless!<p>Sprints seem very compatible with human psychology: movies, books and music usually consist of alternating tension and release. There&#x27;s a series of difficult obstacles, not just one, but a series of problems and solutions. People really respond to this.<p>Curiously, it seems that literal sprints (i.e. running) are also much better for building fitness than consistent paces. And they even have &quot;sprints&quot; in some agile methodologies (not sure if that counts for or against my argument...).<p>Finally, there&#x27;s absolutely a magic in programming, that you code something... and something happens! It&#x27;s a child-like thrill that (in my opinion) it is absolutely crucial to respect and preserve, especially as ones goals become ambitious and abstract. Fred Brooks talks about the &quot;sheer joy of making things&quot; - and compares us both to a child making mud-pies and to God creating nature. (just found an excerpt online: <a href""http://cs.calvin.edu/books/processing/references/brooks/mythicalManMonth_joysWoes.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://cs.calvin.edu/books/processing/references/brooks/myth...</a>)<p>I would guess that, evolutionarily, the human body and mind is adapted to sprints - and this is what makes goals feel so satisfying to us, just as we enjoy food, water etc. The &quot;system&quot; approach makes logical sense, and what you say about it seems true. It&#x27;s just that you haven&#x27;t addressed how it engages with human motivation (but assume it is &quot;an automatic and permanent drive&quot;) - which is the issue OP is struggling with.<p>Lastly - I think OP&#x27;s personal solution will actually come from the thoughts he has when he feels that pain. Part mistaken, part profound - only OP will know which is which. I don&#x27;t claim my suggestion is right for OP, just adding another perspective.",1388607762

Think about this: if toy preference is just a social construction, if we removed all social pressure regarding toy selection, would boys and girls still prefer different toys?<p>It turns out the answer is yes. In 2002, a (very influential) study was performed on vervet monkeys and found that male vervet monkeys showed significantly greater interest in the masculine toys (i.e. a ball and a police car), and the female vervet monkeys showed significantly greater interest in the feminine toys (a doll and a red pan). There wasn&#x27;t much difference in preference for the neutral toys.<p>One study is not enough to show such a trend. So in 2008, the study was repeated a different species of monkey (rehesus) and a different set of toys. The authors found the same results: males preferred stereotypically male toys, and females preferred stereotypically female toys.<p>So we have two studies in two species of primates that found that males prefer &quot;masculine&quot; toys, and females prefer &quot;feminine&quot; toys. From this, it is fairly plausible that innate differences in toy preference will show up in humans as well.<p>Sources:<p>Vervet Study:\n<a href""http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138(02)00107-1/fulltex"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138(02)00107-1/fullt...</a><p>Rhesus Study:\n<a href""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2583786"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2583786/</a><p>Summary of both studies:\n<a href""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/200804/why-do-boys-and-girls-prefer-different-toy"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundament...</a>",1388607609

It doesn&#x27;t provide cutting edge software across the board (though it is possible to get newer versions of common tools that people want to stay on top of, like languages), but it does provide a reasonable level of confidence that what you deployed years ago will continue to run today. Moreso than any other Linux distro out there (in my, not at all limited[1], experience), most likely. And, the security concerns you raised are the ones I wanted to address in my original reply to you; you alleged that CentOS/RHEL provided old and thus insecure software. I wanted to make it clear that&#x27;s not the case; all software is subject to bugs, including security bugs, but CentOS/RHEL are not shipping software with known exploits. It gets fixed, along with the upstream. In fact, the RHEL developers are often providing the upstream fixes, as well; Red Hat employs huge swaths of FOSS developers...really good ones.<p>1-I work on systems management software that is installed a million times a year, on every Linux distro and nearly every UNIX variant, and have done so for ~15 years. I don&#x27;t know everything, but I know which Linux distros provide a stable platform and which ones have a good security record.",1388607292

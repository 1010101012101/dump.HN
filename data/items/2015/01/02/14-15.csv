Web directories failed for this reason, most people want to find stuff, not file stuff.<p>I always thought that the right answer would be a system based on tags, which, if you allow for the tagging of tags, is fairly hierarchical. As a metaphor, the tag is put on data that exists in an otherwise flat unorganized space, and you would place tags on the data after the fact (now you create folders, and &quot;move&quot; data into those folders).",1420210695

The computer vision field is awash with papers proposing a &#x27;new&#x27; algorithm which is then poorly compared to some select group of existing techniques under criteria chosen by the author.  A paper is a very poor substitute for the code itself and really it should be mandatory for code to be submitted with the paper, especially in a field such a computer vision where the entire experimental apparatus could be packed into a zip file.  That way any other group could take the code and independently evaluate the technique without reimplementation.  Indeed my own experience is that often the maths described in the paper is not necessarily responsible for all the results!

The biggest claimed advantage of the rapid release cycles doesn&#x27;t stand up to scrutiny.<p><i>If my project has an annual update cycle, I want to be certain that any new browser features I&#x27;d like to use are widely supported and have been tested in-the-wild for as long as possible before I commit to them.</i><p>That seems perfectly reasonable to me.

It&#x27;s therefore <i>not</i> reasonable to assume that those new features have in fact been thoroughly tested in-the-wild before you rely on them.<p>A related concern is that with the very rapid release cycles, you never really know when an implementation is &quot;final&quot;. We&#x27;ve seen fundamental changes over recent years in everything from the syntax for new CSS features to the layout of controls on multimedia elements, sometimes more than once in the same browser within a few months of each other.

I frequently find that when we run into issues with relatively recent developments in browsers, there are a handful of other people writing blog posts or writing SO questions that show we&#x27;re not alone, but no-one actually has the answer.<p>It&#x27;s also worth considering that just because the main production release of a browser only updates, say, annually, that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that the browser can&#x27;t also have developer releases going out more regularly for those who want to experiment with new features.",1420209669

Essentially, everyone gets his own office.  They are free to personalize it however they want, if the position allows for working at home, the employee can do so. A computer algorithm will calculate your productivity and amount of work done relative to others on a bell curve and take action if necessary e.g. fire you, put out on Craigslist an ad for a new guy etc. All inter personnel communication will be done through a team chat/SharePoint type application where algorithms would remove the tone and replace it with a neutral one. The point is removing the human aspect as humans are fickle and too many people causes office politics. If the program senses anti company behavior, they would record it down for review by senior management. Company policy is that all workers works 9-5 5 days a week unless your position does not allow for that, then you will be exempted from the system.",1420209010

This is a major issue, since much less attention is typically paid to access management for backups than to production servers. Therefore I support the approach of providing secrets through the environment.<p>Once an application has been written to get its secrets from the environment, there is a question of how the secrets are obtained. They can be sourced from a file in an init script, but today we are seeing a lot of momentum towards containerized architecture, and the use of service discovery and configuration systems like etcd, zookeeper and consul.<p>However, secrets require much more attention to security concerns than the data that these tools are designed to handle. Least privilege, separation of duties, encryption, and comprehensive audit are all necessary when dealing with secrets material. To this end, we have written a dedicated product which provides management and access for secrets and other infrastructure resources (e.g. SSH, LDAP, HTTP web services).

If so you&#x27;ll have issues enforcing this if you have a distributed solution which a service with as many users as iCloud will have.<p>If you are doing it on your main identity DB then you also might have scalability issues since you will have to sync these values accross all of your instances.<p>Also don&#x27;t forget that every time you do this &quot;rate limit&quot; it means that there will be a &quot;proccess&quot; on your authentication server idling for the duration of the limit, this means that there will be halted login attempts on your authentication servers, enough of them and you might get into some serious resource issues.<p>A 10 second pause might be acceptable on your laptop after you type your password wrong 3 times, but doing it on the server means that it allocates resources then puts limitations on how fast these resources can be cleared which isn&#x27;t a very good design.<p>As for the UX issues the problem is that it&#x27;s not always as simple as some username and password, especially for services such as iCloud where a simple missbihaving app can cause accounts to be effectively locked out, and when you count in the amount of users such services has then it becomes quite a frequent event.<p>So yes while i do agree rate limiting does effectively prevent brute forcing, i don&#x27;t see it as being a viable strategy for an online service. Rate limiting should be left for closed enviornments where you have full control over your clients and where users can be serviced in a reasonable manner.<p>Putting it on distributed open services that service millions of users where you might have various types of clients that you have no control over making authentication requests will just cause trouble.",1420207598

This scenario makes the case that debt causes growth. From a policy standpoint if you borrow money for long term infrastructure and growth opportunities you could easily see debt as a net positive.<p>OTOH, you run up your credit cards to buy a better TVs or to buy 'friends'.

That's been my only experience so far as a noob who's had two programming internships.<p>I think most men are easy to get along with and I enjoy their friendships. The only female unfriendly experiences I've had on the job have been due to sexual harassment (as in someone actively trying to sleep with a person, not a stupid off-handed joke). In class it's been the more condescending ""you only got that job because you're a girl and you look like this"". I think <i>that</i> needs to stop. It's completely fucked up behaviour. But being on an all male team is fine. I think to say we need to get tech to a completely even score is pointless. Most nurses are women and a few are men and they carry on fine? Not a lot of girls are into coding (at least as of yet) and that's fine too. They're being influenced at a younger age to have an interest in tech now by different organizations and that is great, but if after campaigns such as those are completed and women still don't get to 50% of IT - meh, who cares. Given most women who get into tech enjoy tech related hobbies (video games etc.) it's easy to be friendly to coworkers and others in the industry. It's not like women in tech all feel completely disconnected from the men. The women in my class and I have spoke about this and we generally have all had the same experience (unfortunately that includes the sexual harassment too though).<p>tdlr; most women are not overly sensitive like Adria Richards and we'll be fine.

I think Krugman's (and others') argument that the U.S. government can borrow very cheaply and should therefore act in a countercyclical manner for the common good is plausible. I'm also convinced that the crowding out argument is bogus in an economy that suffers from too little demand whilst corporations are sitting on tons of cash.<p>But we should not lose sight of the fact that interest rates are a highly psychological affair. Once trust in the ability to repay debt gets eroded things can get out of control very quickly. So we should be scared at least a little bit.<p>That said, the U.S is probably the one entity on this planet that is furthest away from that point. Even Japan with it's 245% debt/GDP ratio can borrow at 0.5% for 10 years whilst their currency is crashing and the central bank is announcing a massive QE program twice the size of the U.S one.<p>But if the U.S ever gets to the point where Japan is now, that's when I'm starting read up on agriculture or the hunter-gatherer diet.",1366139949

This means the Browse More section does not follow any pattern and just appears at the end of each link.<p>Because of this, every single quote appears different. For some reason, I think that standard content like read more should be standardized to help me find easy anchors while browsing quickly.<p>That way, when I look at a quote, the only deviating part of the design is the unique content itself, and I can be sure that if it's deviating, it's the content I'm looking for.<p>As it stands, it's difficult for me to parse the whole list as identical elements with differing content, and instead I'm seeing them all as different going down.<p>EDIT: I also do not like that you preserve tabbing from the users input. It's useful in theory but since your url content relies on a tab as well, it creates a very weird dynamic while looking down the page where a tab doesn't really mean anything, because it means something different everytime I see one.<p>EDIT2: I'm not a designer (but I fancy myself an amateur) and if I was in charge of the layout, I'd probably have done something like: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/o0s9UZl.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/o0s9UZl.png</a> -- The subtext is noticably smaller, the url is shortened for consistency and length, and the two aspects of the subtext are floating left and right for solid, consistent anchors.<p>EDIT3: Coming back to it, I went a slightly different direction: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/jfFcB1N.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/jfFcB1N.png</a><p>I know you're not looking for design advice, I just had fun playing with someone else's work.

5560131,comment,5558023,5559360,1,0,T-hawk,,,"This is fascinating indeed, can we break down some actual rules from that example?<p>""Writing table"" is idiomatic, you need to understand that the table's purpose is for a writer, not that ""writing"" is a verb meaning the table is authoring something.  As an idiom, it's very close to an atomic construct to reason about, so that places ""writing"" last and closest to the noun.<p>One of those adjectives (Canadian) modifies another (Wood) rather than the ultimate noun, so they go together.<p>(Maybe that adjective could be forming ""Canadian writing""?  That's silly, but why is it silly?  You need contextual knowledge, to know that a table's characteristics are invariant for any kind of writing, to eliminate the parsing of ""Canadian writing"" as nonsensical.  The syntax alone can't establish that.  Context is required.  If the noun were ""anthologies"" instead of ""tables"", then ""Canadian"" could modify ""writing"".)<p>Similarly, another adjective (Long) implicitly modifies both the ultimate noun and the wood that it's made of.  It would be nonsensical to have a long table made of not-long wood.  So ""Long"" goes outside (before) ""Canadian Wood"".  Context is necessary again here, to know that wood is a material for making tables.<p>""Four"" goes outside everything else, as it's multiplying the entire final construct.<p>""Attractive"" remains, and I'd argue that there isn't a single answer for it, as two other child comments already illustrate.  It could go either before or after ""Long"", and could even convey meaning by that placement, indicating whether the length contributes to the attractiveness (""Attractive Long"") or is just an incidental quality (""Long Attractive"").  ""Attractive"" could even come after ""Canadian Wood"" if the speaker wanted to indicate that the material is not part of the attractiveness.  That construct feels slightly unnatural, but it should because so is the thought.",1366139224

Not only is sensitive data protected against ""SELECT *"", but it's now possible to apply security policies to password management. For example, the password service might enforce rate limiting on how often a particular user's password can be checked -- that way, even if the web server is compromised, the attacker will be unable to compromise passwords any faster than they could via the standard login screen.<p>The password machine would typically be configured to have only the password service and SSH running, with SSH access limited to a key that's stored in a safe somewhere and used only for emergencies.<p>If a developer doesn't feel comfortable building such a system themselves (reasonable), then there are many commercial products available. They're expensive for a home user or ramen-budget startup, but a company like Linode would be able to afford one easily.",1366139134

5560119,comment,5559483,5559709,1,0,bubbleRefuge,,,"Money is being printed depending upon your definition of money. When the treasury spends in excess of tax revenues which is essentially all the time, by law they must issue a treasury security and ""sell"" it. This security gets sold to the primary dealer ( think big Wall Street firms).  Treasury then gets account credited at Fed in the amount of security sale.  Treasury then spends the money back into the economy. This ""money"" is called  reserve balance ( federal funds/vertical money/high powered money). Since the Fed's job is to execute monetary policy ( i.e. price of money) by directly manipulating the federal funds rate, they often buy back that treasury bond from the primary dealer and remove the excess reserves else they lose grasp of the federal funds rate.  Would be nice to get rid of this obfuscated gymnastics between Fed, Treasury, and Wall Street, and simply have direct printing of money as per congressional budgets passed by Congress.  The current system causes mucho confusion and the illusion that the government is self funded.   How can issuer of a fiat currency be involuntarily insolvent?<p>edit: With direct printing, the fed funds rate would go to zero. No need for Treasury Bonds or ""borrowing"" per se.",1366139121

Plus, don't forget, the dollar has undergone fluctuations in value; these fluctuations though are the results of the decisions of a central body. Finally, Forbes seems to be sidestepping the fact that the term ""currency speculation"" exists for a reason.<p>Ultimately, Bitcoin's utility rests on whether its value settles down at some point, which I think it will[1].

I don&#x27;t mean piddly little fires like you see in a bbq grill.  I mean raging infernos hot and wild enough to burn an entire neighborhood to ash in under an hour.<p>The two primary choices for minimizing with this type of risk are: (1) force people to move out of the areas at risk, or (2) prohibit high-risk activities (such as fireworks) in areas of heightened risk.  Prohibiting fireworks in high-risk areas is by far the least restrictive option available.",1377928438
6305954,comment,6304913,6304913,11,0,wgd,,,"Apologies in advance for the wall of text, but the first half is basically just a summary of their protocol for people who don&#x27;t want to try to identify where the actual information resides (it appears to be <a href=""http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/2010/anon/pres/120104-dissent.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/2010/anon/pres/120104-dissent.pdf</a>).<p>As I understand it, the basic idea is that there is a network made up of N clients and M servers, with the clients (and potentially servers) identifiable in some external fashion (IP addresses or GPG keys or whatever, it&#x27;s unimportant to the protocol) and we want to make it possible for any of the clients to broadcast a message without anyone being able to tell which client it came from.<p>So what happens is each client and each server generate a Diffie-Hellman key which is associated with their actual external identity. Then each client establishes a unique secret with each server (and vice versa, naturally). These unique secrets are used to produce N times M unique bitstreams using PRNGs (so each client has a bitstream corresponding to every server that exists, and each server has a bitstream corresponding to each client that exists).<p>Then each client XORs together the bitstreams from the unique secret it shares with each server, and each server does the same thing for each client&#x27;s shared secret. Now there are N + M bitstreams, with the nice property that if you XOR together all of them they all cancel out (because every client-server pairing occurs in the bitstream from that client and the bitstream from that server).<p>Furthermore, if one client also XORs some data into the bitstream that they publish, no one else can tell, it still contains a bunch of indistinguishable-from-noise data to everyone else who might look. But then when we XOR together all N + M bitstreams, we end up with everything cancelling out except for that extra data that one client added.<p>So then the Dissent protocol pulls in another construct, and uses something called MIX to shuffle a set of public keys generated by the peers, and uses these public keys to establish a transmission order, essentially reimplementing TDMA (Time-Domain Multiple Access) in a digital domain with signatures.<p>In my opinion as a hobbyist interested in this stuff, the whole &quot;everyone produces a bitstream and they magically evaporate leaving behind only the data everyone transmitted&quot; thing is almost magically cool. The time-domain multiplexing is less cool, and my EE background compels me to wonder if a meaningful analogue to CDMA or OFDM could be developed. Well, obviously they could be <i>developed</i> the real question is &quot;could they be useful?&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s also sort of interesting how the fact that we can&#x27;t ever be allowed to know when a given peer is transmitting means that the design becomes more &quot;continuous&quot;, with data being transmitted by everyone at all times so that the real transmissions can be disguised. I wonder if the theoretical perfectness could be loosened somewhat to allow only, say, 10% of peers to have to be transmitting at any given time (in the long run this could make it possible to identify a transmitter uniquely, but not so quickly that it wouldn&#x27;t be useful still).<p>Unfortunately, the second bullet-point (accountability) goes close to unfulfilled. And I feel like it sort of has to, since any method which could determine where malicious data comes from can also be used to undermine the anonymity of the system for everyone else. There&#x27;s a <i>kind</i> of accountability, which is that the peers themselves can be associated with a public identity without anyone being able to tell which peer produced a given message, even in theory, but it doesn&#x27;t extend to any system with open registration, because it doesn&#x27;t handle the &quot;sock puppet&quot; problem at all.<p>But personally I think the sock puppet problem is pretty much un-silver-bullet-able. The best we can probably ever hope to do for &quot;general purpose&quot; uses is probably a combination of a cryptographic proof-of-work algorithm, public-key signatures to <i>allow</i> (though not force) persistent identity, and some sort of reputation system.",1377928380

Certainly there are the similarities that in both systems there is no central force-monopolizer that adjudicates disagreements, there is only whoever has the bigger stick in a given area.<p>Likewise countries can choose their own economic adventure in many ways by choosing which currency to use, what fiscal policies to set, and what major ideological alignment they will fall in with (which has large implications for things like trade). Here though the U.S. has been fairly successful in trying to standardize a lot of the economic interplay amongst the nations (e.g. the Bretton Woods accords), but again other nations <i>could</i> do something different if they wished.<p>As far as world federalism, I&#x27;m assuming you mean some type of world-wide central government that has specific delegated responsibilities and authorities and that would operate &quot;on top&quot; of the existing national governments.<p>There&#x27;s a lot to be said for the idea... you&#x27;d finally actually <i>have</i> &quot;international law&quot;, ways of resolving conflicts amongst nations (since there will be actual &quot;world police&quot; of some sort), etc.<p>Certainly the normal example in the U.S. is the slightly wiser Federal government sometimes have to lead state and local governments to Do the Right Thing by the nose if necessary (e.g. voting rights for minorities).<p>But on the other hand such as system tends to accrete power towards the top over time, and you would thus tend to end up with the needs of the many (i.e. China, India) outweighing the needs of the rest, or (more likely) the needs of the already rich (U.S., E.U., etc.) outweighing the needs of the rest of the developing nations.<p>Either way I can see that going poorly for nations like the Philippines or Malaysia, who could over time be gerrymandered right out of resources that would otherwise contribute to their economies.<p>I used to be real idealistic about such Star Trek-style world governments but at this point the idea would probably introduce more worries for me than potential benefits.",1377928269

In fact, they&#x27;re <i>eventually</i> ideal models for all use-cases, given enough training, since all ML models are ways to approximate  Bayes&#x27; law, while Bayes nets just solve for Bayes&#x27; law directly. However, for being so <i>generic</i>, they have no embedded structure that allows them to efficiently learn/represent/compress data in any <i>particular</i> domain.[1]<p>When I have a Big Data problem, and I have a BNN library close to hand, I just throw it at a random subsampling and see what happens. This is what I mean by &quot;naive&quot;: since it&#x27;s a generic solution, you can try applying it to a problem before even studying the structure of the problem domain, and you might just detect a signal soon enough that you don&#x27;t need to go any further.[2]<p>The <i>rest</i> of the machine-learning toolbox, then, is basically a set of models that you replace your BNN with when you have a model that hews closely to the structure of your data (in est, a set of screwdrivers for different kinds of screws.) The approximate model will get quicker training and clearer signals for <i>that</i> data, but not for just any data.<p>---<p>[1] Another way to say it: a Bayes-net implementation is to gzip as other ML models are to JPEG, MP3, etc. Bayes-nets can learn anything, but they can only learn it as well as <i>the data can be used to model the data</i>.<p>[2] People do use linear regression as the same kind of general-purpose tool, as you say--and linear classifier libraries are much easier to write, so you&#x27;ll find them as &quot;batteries included&quot; in more math packages--but if you don&#x27;t <i>know</i> whether the data is linearly separable, linear models aren&#x27;t gonna give you even the slightest hint.

When you have fixed intervals the order book will keep increasing in size until the trades execute on the 1 second interval or whatever it is, and the book will be larger than for our current instantaneous ticks. Larger book means wider spread, as basic game theory says when you have more participants you need a stronger hand to have the same odds, so if you want that trade to execute you put it way outside the last price. HFT firms narrow the spread and take the difference as profit, as they don&#x27;t really care if 1 particular order executes so they play closer to the last price.<p>Randomizing the execution order makes the spread even wider, because now you need to beat everyone instead of just tying if you want to guarantee execution. And again, the HFT firms don&#x27;t care if any particular order executes. Although randomizing the order would probably reduce the incentive to co-locate, but I&#x27;m guessing the larger firms would still want quicker access to the last price, just in case.<p>Also, in all of this I&#x27;m assuming no one outside of the exchange can view the actual book, just the last price.

Lots of exchanges have opening and closing auctions where we can see empirical data.  Some exchanges try to solve last-moment problem by having a randomized start time for the auction: you know it will be between, e.g. 3:25 and 3:30, but not exactly when.<p>That said, Henderschott is a really smart guy and I haven&#x27;t read the paper.  I&#x27;m curious to see what his suggested solution looks like.

Although the quiz part is kinda &#x27;crazy&#x27;, those quizzes will certainly force students to read the required reading before lectures, which is a good thing!!! I am not against this syllabus. However, if the student is 5 min late and he is unable to take the quiz, that would be really sad. So, if we can have a policy like having quizzes in the middle of the lecture and dropping the lowest 2 quizzes, that would solve all the problems. Again, I do believe that quiz will help students study more and read the required reading ahead. I am looking forward to a great 161 this semester.

It is a democratic country, apparently the majority don&#x27;t mind this ban on homeschooling. Now yes, I am speaking from a far away perception. Anyone from Germany please help us out here.  Is this this seen as such an egregious abuse of power people&#x27;s power is just not enough to overturn it or is this what most would agree with?<p>> The question as you put it, I think, is whether culture should be allowed to arise from the grass roots or whether it should be formed by the state in public schools.<p>I think you might have slightly misread my comment though. It wasn&#x27;t my intention to say that this law (making homeschooling illegal) should be enacted here in US. I recognize that it probably wouldn&#x27;t pass and it might not be right.<p>According to stats I found on some .gov site (after 3 seconds of searching) is that about 3% of students in 2007 were home-schooled in US. The number was rising. So it might be higher now. Some states only let parent who have a masters degree or higher to home school their children, that is an interesting approach.<p>My original point was more about saying how some countries might choose to make it illegal and I agree with that. Given public schools are safe and decent and provide a good baseline of education. Lack of emphasis on individualism and cultural expression is just well not part of their culture.<p>Now going back to US or I guess discussing home schooling in general. It seems some things are complimentary -- say one can teach their child to do math in a better way, more efficient, and more intuitive. In general (with  exception, I agree) that is complimentary with what they maybe learning in school.<p>Others are not, like maybe the example with creationism, or how we teach history -- &quot;telling them American Indians were exterminated using bio terrorism by the US government&quot; vs implying that the settlers came to this lush, empty continent, like a God&#x27;s promised land, with a few native inhabitants who strangely chose to live in mosquito infested swaps or the most absolute dry and inhospitable canyons. There is a propaganda and mentality shaping going on. But it is both ways. Because teaching kids about how great the caste system is or about how the earth is 5000 years old is also borderline on child abuse in my book. I don&#x27;t usually subscribe to all cultures are just as good. There are fucked up beliefs and fucked up societal conventions. So I imagine that would be the argument against it ( I am not really sharply for one or the other in US, I haven&#x27;t made my mind yet).<p>> But what if families should take responsibility for raising children?<p>But what if they are crippling them should they be allowed? Putting them in a compound and telling them about trumpets on the hill or how there are lizard aliens living among us, instead of learning about integrals and derivatives. Can&#x27;t you see how perhaps other countries&#x27; citizens might agree with having the government step in.<p>>  It is as if the role of the government in a democratic country is there to save people from democracy<p>I guess it is inevitable that we&#x27;d end up discussing generalized political stuff. But alright, we are already in it. The role of the government in the democratic society, ideally, the way I see is to work for the people. People want protection from foreign invaders, they make their taxes into tanks, they want to drive everywhere, they make taxes into roads, they want healthcare, they turn taxes into subsidized pills and doctors&#x27; visits. I also don&#x27;t understand the big obsession in this country with &quot;let the states do it&quot; vs &quot;let the federal government do it&quot;. Does it really matter that much. If Alabama can do it, let it do it, if it is easier on the federal level, let&#x27;s do it there. The reality is -- it hasn&#x27;t happened.

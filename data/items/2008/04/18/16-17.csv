This is still the first thing that attracts a new user to fb.<p>The problem I see is, without a constant need to stay in touch (i.e. who's doing what, who's going where this week), it really has no purpose. Once I've seen what my buddy in grade 2 is up to now, and who my first girlfriend married, I don't really need to know anything else.<p>Hence: Applications. FB apps are the solution looking for a problem. In many cases, the app itself is what people like to use. For instance, scrabulous is pretty popular with my wife. The problem is that for someone like me, all the apps do is annoy the hell out of me, and make me less likely to use fb.<p>I've seen more than a few friends suddenly drop off fb. I suspect the trend to continue.",1208537988

Drink less beer and more wine and whiskey.  Hoooyah.\n- Don't snack and do get in to things like organic dark chocolate instead of Snickers for dessert.\n- Set a goal to do something like 100 sit-ups and 25 push-ups a day, no matter what.\n- As much as possible, eat locally-grown foods.  Fat, salt and other undesirables are used to counter the loss of flavor in most food that's packed, shipped, frozen, etc.\n- Drink a full glass of water before every meal.\n- Eat more slowly.  Using chopsticks helps with this, until you get really good with chopsticks.\n- Get some exercise band/tube things.  You can loop them under your chair and do shoulder presses at about 25-35lbs. resistance while puzzling through an intellectual problem in your code, or while staring at some stupid YouTube video.<p>The rest is all just about being more active.  If you do that well and your metabolism goes up, you don't even have to be as picky about dieting.  On top of it, some increase in muscle mass will cause you to shed more calories across the board.",1208537803

167377,comment,167255,167337,0,0,WilliamLP,,,"Doing an hour of cardio every day might be too much. (I'm talking about something which is higher intensity than fast walking... That would be great.) Half an hour three times a week would be fine. The issue is with adherence, and also the body's negative response to this much exercise. In many people (including me for sure) it triggers an adaptation that makes them try to conserve calories by making them feel sluggish and lethargic later on.<p>Weight training has similar effects. The body can be in an anabolic mode with a caloric surplus, and in that case, yes it's good to work hard in the gym. (Most people shouldn't go to failure very often if ever though.) But when you are in a catabolic mode, working out very hard with weights is going to lead to adherence issues again, e.g. dreading the workouts. You don't really need to do all that much to maintain muscle mass, as opposed to building it when you are approaching your genetic limit. Three times in the gym per week at 30-45 minutes per session would be just fine in my opinion.<p>In summary, picking something you can adhere to is far more important than trying to optimize the equations in a way that someone with infinite willpower might manage.",1208537332

I average about a 1 pound a week. I'm 5'10 and I've gone from 220 to 194. I'm still going down too. I don't know when I'll stop, but I figure around 170 is right for my frame.<p>I've made several changes in my life that I feel contribute to my loss. I don't know which changes have the most effect, but like anything I think it's a little bit of all of them.<p>First up, Eat real food, not too much, mostly plants. The book ""In Defense of Food"" changed my life. It's not a diet at all, but guidelines to how to eat better for yourself and the environment. I feel this has had the most impact on my weight loss. I eat way more fruits and vegetables now but less food overall. I try (it's damn hard) to stop eating when I'm full.<p>I also go to the gym every day. I don't have a in-depth program. I just have day 1 and day 2. Day 1 is 25-30 minutes of cardio and some simple weight training. I typically hit each major muscle set with one set of reps. Day two rests my weight training -- I do 40-45 minutes of cardio. I should also clarify that I don't hit the gym every day; I don't always go if I'm doing some other physical activity that day.<p>I've been working from home since mid-January. I use the gym in my building at lunch. Again, I do it every day. Commuting and lack of showers in my office were a huge mental barrier for me doing this in the past.<p>I've also been reliably and visually recording my weight. Every Monday I weigh in when I get up. I put my weight into a google spread sheet and it draws a graph for me. Seeing my progress has been a great reinforcement.<p>On top of the spreadsheet, I said in January that I want to be 190lbs by May 1 (I'm a pound off track right now). I used the spreadsheet to track where my progress should be. I purposely set my goals for roughly a pound a week. I was able to do a quick formula to show me where I should be every week.

167334,comment,167255,167255,0,0,rudyfink,,,"I think there are two issues in losing weight:\n1) Dropping the fat aka expending more energy than you absorb and working to keep muscle as you go.\n2) Changing your habits to effect a change to not go back to where you were.<p>Frankly, most of us are professional sitters.  We essentially do nothing physical every day.  If we were, historically, designing the human system, we would have never expected it to expend so little energy in a day.  We have systems to manage and regulate weight but our activity level is below the expected minimum and they fail.  Design-wise--we are not what was expected, so we must consciously do more.<p>This is to say that medicine and science can help you tremendously with 1) but you need to get your head in a different place if you want to succeed at 2) and that is hard++.<p>In addition to your efforts at 1), I would _strongly_ recommend working on new habits.  One I continually recommend is getting the habit of doing <i>something</i> physical for an hour a day on average.  If you can't do an hour at first, do a half-hour on average.  By <i>something</i> I mean literally that: bounce a ball against a wall, go for a walk, go for a run, hit the weights, jump rope, bicycle, etc.  Just make sure you are fairly constantly active for the period.  I think this <i>something</i> idea is more effective because it is much easier goal to keep.  People fail at 2) because they cannot stick to their goals for new habits.<p>This is already more than I intended to write, but I have one last point.  Focus on developing a truthful awareness of what you are putting into your body.  Eating is an amazingly subtle and powerful mental process.  Forcing yourself to be aware of what goes into your body will help you engage better habits.",1208535054

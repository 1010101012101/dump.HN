60978,comment,60845,60845,0,0,lucumo,,,"For some medium-sized, low-tech site:
IE6 49.8%, IE7 34%, other IE: 0.7%, total IE 84.5%<p>FF 2.0.x.x 7.5%[1], other FF 1.9%, total FF 9.4%<p>Others 6.1%[2]<p>1. FF 2.0.x.x number has been arrived by adding the percentages of the seperate versions, so there's some rounding error there. Other FF has been arrived at by subtracting FF 2.0.x.x from total FF (which is accurate).<p>2. Similarly others has been derived by subtracting the totals for IE and FF from 100.<p>You might also find this page useful:<p><a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp</a><p>It contains historical and current statistics on W3Schools visitors.",1191044904

60976,comment,60577,60689,0,0,zach,,,"> I'm old enough to have browsed for hours at Tower Records - using a CD purchase as an excuse to enjoy being in a record store, around all the other music geeks. The 90s were not exactly a match for the glory days of the 70s at record stores, from what I've heard, but it was still pretty great, and I'm sad they're going away.<p>I know where you're coming from.  Tower Records was just always a fun stop on an evening or afternoon out doing nothing in particular.  They had movies, they had CDs, they had funky magazines.  I'm just amazed how quickly they folded.  They were huge and seemed quite profitable.  I never suspected in the 90's that they would be gone in a decade.  Then again, that's nothing compared to the shock the record industry experienced...",1191044631

60974,comment,60793,60815,0,0,yters,,,"The point is, why do you want to get rich?  I thought most hackers here aren't in it for the money alone, but for the freedom it gives them.  But if all you hackers really care about is moolah, then that's pretty boring.<p>If you look at history, how many of the really fundamental, ground breaking ideas came from the people who mainly cared about getting rich?<p>But, I'm not proposing a different system.  I'm all for people sponsoring startups.  Just if people are interested in sponsoring hacking that's primarily aimed at interesting ideas, I'm more for that.  I suspect pg is headed in this direction once YC becomes lucrative enough.  His philosophy posts obviously show he's interested in much loftier things, albeit with empirical feedback.",1191044326

60963,comment,60960,60960,0,0,johnrob,,,"Awesome.  I had been thinking about building something like this for a while.  Here is a tip (I am handing over the rest of my idea to you now):
Index the content of the actual articles (follow the links).  This would offer a perfect way to search for stuff you once read on ycnews.  I usually remember what I read, not what the ycnews title was.  It could also be easily extended to index reddit, digg, or any other link driven site.",1191042823

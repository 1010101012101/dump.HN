Not being able to share with other members of the world-wide flu monitoring network what they need to be watching for is irresponsible at best.<p>The fact that this variant of the virus was formed relatively easily, however, leads me to believe that there is a reason that it hasn't been found in the wild yet. It could be that transmission in ferrets is <i>not</i> exactly like transmission in humans. It could be that this variant is transmissible by air in a lab setting, but is critically vulnerable to environmental factors in the wild.

3492058,comment,3489639,3491730,1,0,alexqgb,,,"Thanks for the kind words. And I actually see three separate concerns in your first question.<p>1. ""How do we know that we can govern/enforce that law?""<p>The same way we currently do. This plan changes nothing about the way established companies handle copyright. It simply means we stop trying to apply those same rules and standards to private individuals, and acknowledge that business models must change to reflect that limit.<p>Difficult, I know, but evolution is tough for everybody. And we already accept that companies die all the time. There's nothing special about media companies that should permit them to stop the clock so they can live forever.<p>Instead, rights-holders can maintain their relevance by sucking it up and proceeding accordingly, or they can die trying. But we can't allow them to respond to the 21st century, and the rise of ubiquitous general computing by insisting that the Internet's architecture be reworked to support the powers of surveillance and censorship that effective enforcement at the individual level unavoidably requires.<p>2. ""What if a digital currency (say, bitcoin) becomes a useful model for online payments, in a way that cannot be tracked or enforced?""<p>If a legally chartered corporation starts using bitcoin to evade regulatory oversight, I suspect the practice wouldn't be limited to IP payments only. Nor do I think the IRS would tolerate it for one hot second. In other words, I don't think this is a problem that this plan needs to solve.<p>3. ""...People can then profit from others' works.""<p>True, but under the scheme I'm proposing, they wouldn't need bitcoin to do it. They could freely profit using credit cards if they liked. What I'm suggesting is that ""profit"" and ""commerce"" are potentially too intimate to be the triggers for a set of rules as heavy-duty as copyright.<p>In the same way that the IRS doesn't demand that 1099's be issued to anyone receiving less than $600 in a year, we need to recognize that commerce and profit at a certain scale, not in general, is what engages the law. Exactly what that scale is can be hard to say. I don't even try. Instead, I just used incorporation as a shining line that triggers involvement.<p>This has the moral value of protecting the cultural liberty of actual humans, while asserting that corporations DO NOT share the same liberty. It also has practical value in that corporations have quarterly reporting requirements that make general audits much more reliable. And it economic development value in that it creates a bounded but otherwise very unrestricted economic space in which new cultural forms can freely gestate and develop, without worrying that they become ""infringers"" the second a single dollar changes hands.<p>For example: you live in Brooklyn and you want to host a rooftop party where you screen movies, play music, drink beer, and enjoy summer. You arrange for all of the above, then charge people a $10 cover. The object is to cover costs, but who knows, perhaps you make a few bucks on the deal. So what? Should the law allow various rights holders to extract rent from this situation? My feeling is no. Indeed, they really can't. And for that reason, they really shouldn't be free to outlaw this either.<p>Now what happens if the film series takes off? The City demands that you get a liquor licence. The landlord (who is surprisingly cool) wants a small cut and proof of insurance. You actually have to treat this like a business. And maybe there's a decent business here. But do you want the personal liability involved? Or would you rather incorporate?<p>Assuming you incorporate, the whole deal changes. This is where you become part of the larger system that transfers money from audiences to the people making the stuff that attracts them. How those terms work is TBD. Obviously, rights holders don't want them to be too stringent, since that encourages people to take greater and greater risks before biting the bullet and joining the payment structure. They also need to reconcile themselves to the idea that cultural freedom with a bit of money involved is like adolescence for operations that aren't kids, but aren't adults.<p>In terms of the developing the next generation, that stage is vital. And being smart enough to leave it alone is in rights holder's interests. If they stop trying to kill fledgling operations while they're figuring themselves out, they'll actually be in a position to benefit from a new generation of really capable adults who will help find new markets for their products. But they have to let those nascent businesses develop freely and independently. And they have to respect the will of a democratic populace that thinks this kind of liberty is a good thing.<p>Incorporating is like turning 18, or 21. We all know that there are people who are still very immature at those ages, and others who have reached maturity a few years earlier. But qualifying who is and is not a legal adult based on those personal differences is a fool's errand. Instead, we have bright shining lines that are hard to fudge, and that work well enough to live with.<p>And to be honest, knowing what I know about the ambitions of people who are attracted to media as a business, there will be plenty of people doing everything they can to put the kid's table behind them, and take a seat with the grown ups.",1327106635

And I like to choose liberal arts subjects when I can for general ed, for the sake of being well-rounded.<p>I find non-hard-science courses to be a little easier in general, but not much easier and not always. You sometimes get professors in a subject like art history who have very specific ideas about how an essay should be structured and what elements are legitimate topics of discussion. Being grammatically correct is often not good enough. There can be quite a bit of intellectual challenge in figuring out what type of essay will result in a good grade, and being able to do this sort of thing may translate into increased chances of success in terms of dealing with customers, coworkers, or managers.<p>At this point I consider it easier to write a program than an essay.

The absolute nature of discrete math can be a comfort, not a difficulty.<p>I think some CS Engineers get a biased view of other subjects because they only take the introductory or elementary versions of other courses.

3491985,comment,3491800,3491800,1,0,colonelxc,,,"I'm not a web developer, but hopefully I can point you in the right direction.  If you're comfortable with Python, then I can point you to the popular Django[1] web framework.  Though really, if you've barely used Python, then it would probably be equally easy to get started with Ruby and Ruby on Rails[2] instead.  Like I said, I'm not a web developer, but I know both frameworks have lots of support and information out there, including tutorials.  I highly recommend following through with some tutorials first, just to get yourself accustomed to how the platform works.<p>As far as your actual idea goes, I saw the keyword ""privately"".  Now when you first start out and it is just you and your girlfriend, then privacy is easy if you two are the only ones who can access the site.  Presumably other people would also want to make sure that not even you, the site administrator would be able to view their uploaded videos.  That is probably going to mean encryption, and the mess that comes with it.  Colin Percival has a recent blog post[3] about designing apps and services so that the users don't have to trust the developers.<p>In the meantime, a quick and dirty solution would be to have a Dropbox account that the two of you share, so when you place a file in the proper directory, it automatically gets synced to the other person.  You could even encrypt the videos locally before putting them in the Dropbox folder. (You'll probably have to move them from the Dropbox folder to elsewhere after the sync, or you'd quickly fill up the 2GB limit for free accounts).<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.djangoproject.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.djangoproject.com/</a>

I assume you mean the middlemen of Hollywood - people who add zero value to the entertainment industry. If so, I completely agree.<p>Startups need to offer content creators a better/cheaper/easier way to distribute their content. Distribution is where startups can really succeed. When I say distribution, what I mean is the method by which people consume content. The problem is the middlemen control the true content creators.<p>The biggest problem is quality. Youtube is a dead simple way to distribute content but the problem is you'll never see anything on Youtube that rivals the quality of something on NBC, HBO, CBS etc. I believe Netflix has the right idea by funding their own high-quality content to distribute on their own ""network."" However, Netflix may just end up becoming another NBC, HBO, Warner Bros. over time.<p>As I mentioned before, the best was to achieve the goal of killing the middleman is by providing high-quality content creators a way to get funding and distribute their work to large audiences without giving up the rights to their work. Additionally, there are plenty of ways to increase margin by using technology to get viewers more involved with the content. We've only just begun to scratch the surface of interactive entertainment.<p>I've been thinking about this stuff for a while and it's a difficult, complex issue.

Innovation of businessmodel is urgent. Income for artists is moving towards liveconcerts, merchandise ans sponsorship. In the future it seems impossible to run a company solely on music recordings.""<p>""The movie industry is still growing, although rentals are in steep decline. Future growth in Internet bandwidth may lead to decline eventually. Because of the inherent character of movies (people tend to view them once), file sharing may prove critical. The movie industry must not ignore this.""<p>""The games industry is growing fast; at least in the console market. PC sales are stagnating. File sharing is less of a threat here. Besides that, the games industry is inherently more innovative and seeks out online solutions.""<p>""The total market of music, film and games is relatively constant, but music is going down while games are going up.""",1232485185

Microsoft concerns itself with its ecosystem more than anything. Apple doesn't do this and Palm is splitting from their's with the Pre.<p>Apple's attitude is, ""we created something great and you should want to develop for it and if you're a user with legacy stuff, you should just migrate"".  That's fine most of the time with consumers.  Likewise, their programmers have gotten used to making little tweaks when a new version of OS X comes out to make sure things work well.  Microsoft, on the other hand, has tried to keep everything working even if the company that created an add-on is now defunct.  It's chained them up.  Something relied on a bad behavior of IE so that behavior must be kept even if it is sub-optimal for many things.<p>The Pre looks cool and I'm getting one as soon as it comes out (Sprint customer who doesn't want to switch carriers).  However, it's completely new.  It wouldn't be a platform to move Windows Mobile users to. Palm has created something that looks really great.  But Microsoft really needs to decide if it's willing to let go of the legacy compatibility that Windows Mobile has going for it and require the people who have made Windows Mobile applications to suffer a dead end and port to a new platform.<p>It's easy when you're at the bottom to embrace change - you don't have developers and customers to loose.  Microsoft has a lot to loose.  Break compatibility and people can migrate to competitors as easily as they can migrate to your new model.  Of course, the other side is that if you don't make the changes necessary, you can start loosing people because your product gets old and kludgy.",1232483253

442206,comment,442006,442006,0,0,lincolnq,,,"I am especially interested in the domain-generation part. I've wondered how it would be convenient for an infection to phone home to its owner (call her Mallory). There are several interesting requirements for such a communications channel -- it must not have a single point of failure; extremely difficult to trace to Mallory after the fact, even for a powerful (e.g., governmental) entity; it doesn't allow convenient hijacking of the channel by an external party.<p>According to the article and related articles, this worm generates domain names based on the current date. Probably many of these domains are owned by innocent parties, and many are unowned. At some point, one of the domains will serve Mallory's payload. The question is whether it will be a new domain that she registered, or an existing, innocent-looking domain she has hacked (or otherwise convinced to serve the content she wants -- perhaps steganographically via a blog comment or something?) If she registers a single domain, it seems likely she will be able to be tracked down by following a money trail. So my guess is that she's found some sites who have been ""convinced"" to serve her magic content, and tweaked the constants for the domain-generating algorithm so that the worm will land on these sites on a day of her choice in the future.<p>Of course, the magic content isn't up yet. The sites she's found to host it won't serve it until the correct day, otherwise white-hats would be able to play their computer clock forward and figure out what domains served the content on which day.<p>And she can bundle her public key with the worm so that she can verify her own payload as opposed to some hijacker's. (That part's easy.)<p>This is cool. The tough part is finding people willing to serve your magic content on the right day. But I bet that's not too hard in practice. I always wondered how people would control a botnet -- some old bots used to use IRC, but that has a single point of failure (the IRC network).",1232482681

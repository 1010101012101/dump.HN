This is a discussion about high-level financial &quot;advice&quot; that was woefully inadequate for the intended audience (retail investors).<p>To highlight this, I used the author&#x27;s lack of distinction between bonds and bond funds and the most simple difference between <i>how they function as employed by your average retail investor</i>. You&#x27;re obviously free to go off on a wild tangent detailing in more depth the way that bond funds <i>can</i> be used, but ironically you&#x27;re only proving my original point: this is not nearly as simple as the OP&#x27;s advice (&quot;buy a bond fund!&quot;) and requires an investment of time and effort that exceeds what the vast majority of people are willing to put in.",1417417045

8679812,comment,8677556,8678644,0,0,edwinnathaniel,,,"> like I said, the only proven risk factor for bugs is number of lines of code.<p>There&#x27;s never been a proof that writing code in Ruby WILL give you LESS bugs than in Java just because you&#x27;ll end up with LESS LOC. I think this is a generic statement that needs to be clarified.<p>I agree and I will not argue that LESS lines of code &quot;might&quot; give you LESS bugs given that you&#x27;re writing it using the SAME language (version 1 in Java has more lines than version 2 in Java, maybe because in version 2, the developer gained more experience and can write idiomatic Java and use libraries instead of rolling his/her own). But Ruby yielded less bugs because of less line of code is a marketing speak to sell the religion of Ruby.<p>Sometimes I wonder why developers aren&#x27;t forced to just use LISP since everybody in the whole world knows that LISP is super expressive that it MUST resulted in far less code right? Right?<p>> When I worked at last.fm this was literally my entire job (well, from PHP). You&#x27;re rearchitecting anyway, creating stable interfaces and putting load balancers in there because those are also things you need to do as you&#x27;re scaling up. Changing languages is no harder.<p>Fred Brooks Second System <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect</a> is exactly what you&#x27;re experiencing, forget the language war for a second please. Really.<p>I work for a company that has been using Java since probably 2002/2003 (I joined in 2012). Server-side in Java with Client-side in Swing, slowly evolving the Server-side POJO (probably no Application Server), to EJB 2.x (shudder) to EJB 3.x and goes to the cloud we go (AWS). Recently we refactor a certain part of our code and added Microservice written in JAX-RS because we have to integrate with another product suite internally. That&#x27;s what I called re-use and evolution of code-base: 10 years of Java where some of the code from the past were/are reused and still in production today. (.... but boy those old code aren&#x27;t pretty, hehehehe).<p>Oh, I almost forgot the part where we used shell script to build, moved to Ant, moved to Ant + Ivy, and slowly moving to Maven (if we need to write a new microservice, maven by default, the rest have to move slowly).<p>Oh, here&#x27;s the best part: last year we moved away from homegrown migration tool to use Flyway, 4-6 lines of Java code to initialize and execute the migration workflow dropped in our old Java code.<p>So yes, if we had to re-write and re-write and re-write to different languages every time, it is definitely will be harder.<p>> You can hire the experience - Java is literally the easiest language to hire for (I mean, hiring is still hard, and there are a lot of crap java programmers around, but there is a bigger pool of experienced programmers out there than any other language).<p>Ops, not devs.<p>>  and you absolutely cannot rely on the engineers who bought the first version still being around when the time comes to rewrite; the half-life of an engineer in a startup is not large.<p>Thank God it&#x27;s Java, not PHP, not Perl, not Ruby (I give Python a pass because I&#x27;m being nice). IDE helps a lot. This reminds me of Zed Shaw blog about charging a lot of money fixing Rails mess as a consulting service.<p>> Twitter was the article&#x27;s choice of example, not mine - and from a business point of view Rails worked really well there<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that they made a bad move or whatnot I&#x27;m just merely debunking the common stories of how small team beat big team (that may have big expectation/big scale yet not focused on solving customer needs) because of the technology/languages.

8679807,comment,8675952,8678415,0,0,gfodor,,,"I don&#x27;t think you read the article I linked. Reducing the effective duration on the bond fund portion of your portfolio boils down to the same thing you&#x27;d do in any healthy portfolio: yearly rebalancing.<p>Also, the point is not to hedge &#x27;interest rate risk&#x27; by just buying shorter duration funds, full stop. Interest rates do not pose a risk unless you had a set date to liquidate your investment. If you are not planning on liquidating your bonds then interest rates pose no risk, they just affect the growth of the income stream.<p>The point is, if you are concerned about getting your principal returned, decide upon how many years down the road you need it back. That is your initial duration. To maximize your return under that constraint, buy a fund at that duration. Then yearly rebalance with other shorter duration funds (while reinvesting coupons properly) to taper the net duration down over the course of the investment period. There you go, you&#x27;ve just simulated a single bond but now are no longer exposed to default risk.<p>Again: perpetuating the idea that &#x27;getting your principal back&#x27; is a feature only found if you buy individual bonds directly is untrue and can result in <i>terrible</i> investment decisions. It presents a false dilemma between a &#x27;secure principal&#x27; and diversification. Forgoing diversification in <i>bonds</i> is one of the most dangerous things you can do. More than any other asset class, bonds benefit immeasurably from diversification (and probably also active management) since default risk is the major risk the investor faces.",1417415741

Those solution would steal a bit of power from the 110 lines.  If you are trying to hack something with some relays, I would suggest a sleepy radio, plus a thing called a latching relay.  A latching relay allows you to connect/disconnect without continuously applying power and instead only applying power when changing the configuration.  Still though, the batteries are going to be a pain once you start using anything electromechanical or radios unless you are really careful at each step.",1417415458

It has to do with the pressure and temperature variations as the rocket travels through the atmosphere. (There are pockets of isothermal regions, or regions where the temperature is the same in the atmopshere, and there are pockets where the temperature varies; therefore the Mach number varies). The atmospheric pressure and temperature affect the flame of the aerospike and act like a &quot;variable&quot; nozzle.<p>Aerospikes aren&#x27;t as popular because,<p>1) they&#x27;re heavy. more deadweight mass on a launch vehicle is a big no no. By deadweight I mean everything on the launch vehicle that doesn&#x27;t contain the a) payload b) propellant. Because once you burn out (or run out of propellant), usually that&#x27;s when you stage (or separate) your payload from the launch vehicle. At that point, the launch vehicle is useless; deadweight.<p>2) they require a massive amount of cooling: you&#x27;re basically heating up a piece of metal to launch temperatures during the launch sequence. You have to make sure your &quot;spike&quot; doensn&#x27;t melt.<p>3) There is a bunch of research and development into other cheaper alternatives, and we already <i>have</i> cheaper and efficient alternatives. This basically pushed aerospikes to the &quot;novelty&quot; category. I&#x27;m sure if there was a big technological &quot;push&quot; for aerospikes I&#x27;m sure we could get something that&#x27;s more efficient but that research and time will cost more than to just use the rockets we have now.<p>ADDENDUM; here&#x27;s a video from Rocketdyne explaining aerospike engines: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWf4iOMSPNc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWf4iOMSPNc</a>",1417414769

This is only true if you&#x27;re trading, and civilizations trading energy can&#x27;t really be separate civilizations.<p>The only civilization we&#x27;re stealing resources from does not exist yet because it&#x27;s in the future. We have one global civilization that is pooling a single resource base via highly liquid trade.  There might be civil war between factions, but don&#x27;t think a real resource war can occur under the current environment. Now, might we split into an &#x27;eastern empire&#x27; and a &#x27;western empire&#x27; like the Romans did? Quite Possible.",1417413803

I can say &quot;no&quot; to someone who tries to intimidate me.  The worst relationships are those with a threat on the table you&#x27;re not quite sure about.   I&#x27;d rather call the threat in and deal with the consequences than live with a sword hanging over my neck.  Life is too short for that crap.",1417413648

Locking down your platform when noncrapware that users do want is also available but only one someone else's gear is how you turn Apple back into being what they were before the iPhone: a footnote.<p>Of course, this does mean those developing for more open rival platforms will have to actually produce noncrapware, not the poor excuse for software many places ship today.

Indeed, Daisey is perhaps one of the most obvious examples of why factual correctness <i>does</i> matter, because all of his falsehoods seem to stem from an egotistical desire to paint him as the savior of China's oppressed worker. So while Daisey's overall point is true, it remains that a fundamental part of it- specifically the role of Mike Daisey- is completely false, and, insofar as it really amounts to Daisey attempting to stroke his own ego, it really is tremendously disgusting.",1332212329

3727568,comment,3725302,3727257,4,0,Gnolfo,,,"> I suspect though, that its extremely hard for someone to police themselves to avoid giving a candidate points for giving the ""right answer"".<p>It can be hard.  But I'd argue getting caught up with what to say and what to ask only makes it harder.  Questions and answers both shouldn't be doing all the heavy lifting for an interview.  They do some, certainly, but IMO the best interviews are when we get out of the Q&A cycle and wind up talking about our views on X, Y, Z (topics that are: a) business related, b) company specific or c) tech appropriate, about 90% of the time).<p>> The trick is to completely ignore their initial response as signal, and then engage them with their response, whatever it may be.<p>I think I'd agree, but would modify that with ""the trick is to not make a snap judgement on their response, but first engage ...."".  I mean really we could hash out all the initial responses we'd expect to hear from the question.  Advancement opportunities, Salary, Autonomy, Culture, and so on, and that list by itself is not all that interesting, so it's dubious to make any conclusions on someone on their 3-5 choices until you get into the reasons behind them.  And we're not really trying to make any judgements or conclusions about them, with this question.  This is more a backdrop to their professional persona and their career goals along with their day-to-day work goals, and will come up as support behind your decision later on whether or not to continue with the hire, one way or another.  EDIT:  I should also note it helps the employer communicate back what areas they think will or will not work well with what the employee is looking for, so it is useful to both parties for making a decision.<p>> You're right, hiring is an arms race. Especially when we have endless blogs about the next hack for hiring rockstars, and thousands of job seekers studying these to get that edge. As a candidate I know that I better give him the answers he expects, even if they don't paint a completely accurate picture.<p>When you're talking to a recruiter or someone in HR who is several layers removed from those you would answer to or work with, then yes that interview will be more about aligning skillsets and experience and so on, and I've had only a rare few interviews with recruiters who didn't just stick to a script.  For someone with real say in the final hire, though, I would highly advise against contributing to that arms race and instead treat the interview as a real no shit normal conversation (but about important stuff to both of you).  If they get even a whiff that you're calibrating what you say with what they want to hear instead of actually considering their prompt and discussing it like an honest adult, it doesn't matter if you are months ahead of them on the latest interview game theory or not, they're going to weigh that behavior against your other good qualities.<p>> Case-in-point: for this question my #1 would be salary. This answer would likely immediately disqualify me with 95% of the people who would ask this question.<p>What's the rationale behind that assumption?  I imagine salary/compensation will make the short list for most commonly occurring response to the original question.  I mean, the company you're applying to is a for-profit entity, most likely, so why would they count it as a mark against you (much less ""immediately disqualify"" you) when you have the same motives as they do for getting out there and working hard every day?  It's an obvious and unimaginative response, yes, but then they go ""Okay, why salary?  would you look primarily at salary or would other forms of compensation supplement your salary considerations, such as: more vacation/PTO, quarterly/annual bonus programs, insurance plans, misc. stipends, share options..."" and you can respond on down the line and go into what exactly they offer or would consider offering. It shows you are comfortable navigating the different employer/employee dynamics that can exist (NOTE: Startups especially tend to have wide ranges of different compensation packages and we devs often find ourselves at one or another during our career) and also have a good sense of what you're looking for in those regards.  I don't just want to hire the one who will cost me the least on paper, and I won't take offense when someone is looking to make good money working with me and is confident they can add enough value to the company over time that it will be justified; I will be willing to pay more for someone who knows what they want and what they're doing and isn't guarded about talking about it when the time is appropriate, they'll probably be a far better investment than someone who says (or acts like) they don't really care what you pay them as long as it covers their bills.  (That being said, people starting out in their career usually don't think much on this sort of stuff so it's not like I always expect a new hire to have all this sorted out)<p>Anyway, I don't disagree with you all the way or anything but in my experience it's best to walk away from the game of tricky questions and stock ""best"" answers.  Anywhere you are hired will be needing you <i>problem solving</i> and <i>communicating</i> by your first week, which are the two things those trick questions are imitating.  So (ignoring technical acumen and so on) demonstrate you can do those in the interview and look for that when giving an interview.<p>Disclaimer:  I actually love interviews, either side of the table, so I'm a little weird.",1332212031

It also has a problem retaining top talent.<p>While big and growing and profitable it is noticeably disturbed that the best people keep leaving. It is trying to fix that and failing miserably.<p>Here is what is making me leave.<p>1. Severe lack of control over how I work. A new, crappy source control tool is being shoved down our throats over our objections.<p>2. Because it is not a tech company, but a company which happens to have software development department, IT has washed their hands of us, and is in fact in open warfare with us. Fun!<p>3. <i>Software is always seen as the problem. Just don't take it personally.</i> This was told to me by a very senior manager who has been here for many, many years.<p>4. Official corporate policy STRONGLY discourages contact between software and the rest of the company. Contact I might use to try and fix that ""software is always the problem"" perception. But nope, not allowed to try.<p>5. The director of engineering tends to undercut us at random instances. For example, while I was the tech lead on a project he decided certain documents must not leave the company because they ware too sensitive. I was not consulted. It made my job 10x more difficult. Other documents which contained the exact same information + more, were sent out like free hot cakes.<p>6. A couple of hyper confrontational, screaming, perfectionist control freaks which are cronies of the director of engineering and I happen to report to one of them. Not actually the worst boss possible. Within that loud control freak perfectionist there is a mostly rational engineer. Who is also very technically competent. He just sucks big time as a manager and dealing with him is incredibly emotionally exhausting.<p>At one point he become so frustrated with another member of our team he literally gave up on him and dumped managing him in my lap. My management of him consisted of talking to him calmly. This resulted in him over-delivering on all his assigned tasks.<p>7. Corporate red tape bullshit bureaucracy.<p>8. My team has a few open positions (go figure!) one of them happens to be damn near identical to mine, the position is advertised for 20K more than I am getting paid. This is after I have asked for a raise. After I took a huge project that was supposed to be a train wreck, saved it, shipped it on time, and made a ton of money for the company.<p>I have an interview with another smaller company at the end of this week.",1332211712

But I think it won't be as bad as you think, You'll still have you dev environment, you mouse, keyboard, and touchpad all working in harmony.  Here's a snippet from another post I made (discussing mobile vs desktop OS's, hope it provides some alternative viewpoint:<p>""I'm pretty sure this is the direction all OS's we will be using are going to end up in the coming years. Some people will cry and yell and holler that there is no way something can be made for both keyboard, mouse, and touch screen. I see this as simply a failure of vision. That's absolutely the way things are going to be going, and it's coming sooner rather than later. (I actually think the OSX launchpad is pretty close to allowing this implementation) Devices are getting smaller and smaller. I use a Mackbook air. but guess how it gets hooked up at home? That's right, wireless keyboard and mouse, nice big monitor, I never see the actual computer. It's only a matter of time before my laptop gets replaced by a tablet that has comparable hardware specs. The OS allow for my normal desktop interfaces, along with a nice touch screen interface. I'll use it to pick out movies to play on my TV, from my couch. I""ll use the same device to write code at my desk (with big monitor and keyboard). My kids will use it to play video games, both mobile, and on the TV. I'll use it to send email in the backseat of a car moving at 65mph. (As a wireless comms guy, I fully appreciate the technology it takes to perform that last action.)
But the bottom line is, It's going to happen. Sooner rather than later.""<p>I guess my point is, mobile and desktop can blend perfectly.

That's why any C/C++ project worried about performance writes custom slab allocators, which a GC doesn't prevent you from doing. In fact, the GC frees you from thinking about memory management in most cases so you can focus your effort on optimizing the pieces that count. GC doesn't prevent stack allocation either; C# has explicit stack allocation and Java does it implicitly with escape analysis. The only advantage of malloc is its predictability. Hopefully Go will eventually get a pauseless collector to mitigate that concern too.",1332211225

If he didn't do that, it wouldn't feel like an office.<p>Previously he had worked with Webvan, and one of their costs that was unexpectedly high was product fulfillment.  Kiva was built partly as a solution to that problem (though it was after Webvan went bankrupt).<p>Their initial prototypes (we saw pictures of them) we're extremely scrappy, and I believe too big to realistically be used.  I think they raised money with the prototype and computer simulations?<p>The robots are talked to wirelessly, and apparently wireless represented a major technical challenge (it was before wifi took off I believe).<p>The co-founder with robo-soccer experience was targeted.  He said something along the lines of ""If you can make a robot play soccer, you can definitely make a robot follow a grid and pick up shelving.""<p>I got the impression that he gave up a lot of equity to get co-founders at seemingly late points in the game, but didn't regret it.  I think people normally put a ton of effort into maintaining equity, sometimes at the risk of losing a great team member.  It looks things worked out.<p>The great thing about this company is that it's indisputably the best solution available, although high costs mitigate some customers.  He told the story of a stress test they did with one major brand name.  To simulate high buying season, they held up regular orders for three days, then pushed them through at once without an issue.<p>Other cool benefits: despite having to power these robots, the power bills with Kiva end up being less expensive because of savings in lighting, heating and AC.  Most fulfillment solutions require the entire warehouse to be lit up and heated so a person can comfortably work, while Kiva keeps the main warehouse dark and temperature doesn't matter much.<p>At the time, they were the fulfillment solution of some companies that Amazon had acquired, but not Amazon itself.

That has, as you suggest, generally been excellent.<p>The problem is that if you decide your standard is going to be a ""living"" document that changes rapidly as the industry evolves, backward compatibility ceases to have any meaning because there is nothing stable to be backward compatible with.<p>What happens when one browser pioneers a new feature, the living HTML5 standard quickly adopts it, developers start writing to that standard, but then two other browsers decide on another way to do the same thing that they think is better and someone changes the living HTML5 standard to reflect the new ""standard"" instead? One possibility is that the developers' existing code breaks. Another is that browser makers are stuck with supporting both once-standard interpretations for a long time.<p>Alternatively, but almost as bad, what happens when the living HTML5 standard quickly adopts a new feature that is becoming popular, other browsers find a better way to do the same thing shortly afterwards, and the standard <i>doesn't</i> change to match? Now the standard sucks, because it rushed into formalising something before enough consensus had built.<p>Formal standards don't mean anything unless they are robust, stable, citable references that everyone concerned can agree on. A living document that rapidly changes in the face of a fast-evolving industry is exactly zero of those things, and its value will be similarly small and round. It's merely a reference non-implementation, and since we're talking about browsers, we already have several candidates for being an actual reference implementation, just as we did in the old IE vs. Netscape days, when we learned for the first time why formal standards matter.<p>Alas, as George Santayana observed a century ago, those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.",1332211013

He's a good shill, but he's a shill, nonetheless.<p>A little background. I'm old enough to have been ""inspired"" by the Space Shuttle Program near the point of its inception. Imagine a young mkn sitting down with a pencil and paper to work out how much it would cost to buy himself a ticket on the Space Shuttle at the promised $50/lb. I weighed 70 lbs. I knew it would be more than $3500 because I'd have to eat and breathe while I was up there. I wondered if I could go naked to save some cash. But still, it was a nice number. And then, the number changed. The promise went up to $100/lb. Fine. The math was easier. Oh, and the number of launches went from 26/year down to 12/year. Not quite the airline-style operations they had promised, but not bad. And then the price went to $500/lb. 3 or 4 launches per year. And then, the media just stopped talking about the costs and launch frequency, probably because it quit showing up in the press kits.<p>Tyson complains that we don't dream about the future anymore. He's right. We don't. But he complains without the slightest hint of irony. The promise of NASA was that the costs would come down. The promise was that spaceflight would become routine and affordable. The promise tapped into the then-current emphasis on mobility in the American Dream. Tyson is right that we don't dream about the future anymore. But we don't dream about it because NASA has proven to us what the future is. The future is NASA, and the future is stagnation. We have all been ""inspired"" by NASA. We don't dream because we don't need to. We know.<p>Tyson breathlessly opines about all the amazing things NASA could do with twice the budget. Missions to Mars! To those, I have this to say: Big fucking deal. The promise of NASA was never its ""missions"". The missions were a vehicle for the promise. The promise was ubiquitous space access. I'm going to see my cousin on the Moon. We're taking a year and seeing Mars. Sending some highly-selected and highly-trained spam in a can for some fahrt around a crater is not the promise. Sending you and me there for a fahrt around a crater is. Somehow or other, that part of the promise has slipped out of NASA enthusiasts memory. Long live NASA! All we have to do is pay twice as much!<p>The imagery of the Shuttle and of the new capsule is especially offensive. It's the easiest thing in the world to verify that the Shuttle was the most expensive launch system ever conceived in the history of manned space flight. It is, as I've hinted above, the primary reason for the complete demoralization of the populace with regards to space flight. And it was promised to be so much better than that. The Orion capsule is all that is left of that disgraced launcher program, the one that retained the disgraced SRBs to placate Morton-Thiokol.<p>NASA can't. That's my new slogan. Unlike other slogans, which are mainly inspirational, mine is intended to remind me of reality. Take any dream you have about space and phrase it as a question, and the answer is ""NASA can't"". Will we build orbiting habitats in space on a massive scale? NASA can't. Will we ever colonize the Moon or Mars? NASA can't. Will we ever be able to realistically dream of democratic access to space? NASA can't. Every time you hear Tyson speak, just remember: NASA can't. And it ain't for lack of funds.<p>I wish Tyson would other shut the hell up or direct his energies and oratorical gifts at making NASA an agency worth supporting. But, he won't.

First of all, this problem has already been solved with fuses.<p>Fuses have nothing to do with not dying, fuses are not a life safety device.  Your protected for the same reason your safe inside a car that gets hit with lightning, for electricity to pass through your body you have to be a path to ground more over you have to be a very good path to ground compared to other available paths, both of which are highly unlikely in the circumstance being discussed.<p>In terms of electrical energy discharge that would be determined by the voltage across your body and the resistance of your body given the contact points, environmental conditions and duration of contact.  The ability of the battery to supply enough energy is really irrelevant, it takes a very small amount of current across your heart to send it into fibrillation.  But, as just mentioned, you'd actually have to create a potential across your body first anyway.<p>> Since the power rating is usually an engineering constraint, this generally means that the stored power for driving 300 miles can usually only be released around the time it takes to drive for 300 miles. Perhaps a little quicker.<p>That is completely incorrect.  I have no idea what constant your talking about but many/most/all batteries can discharge energy far faster than they would under standard operating conditions.  You can even short them out and watch a nice explosion in many cases, which is far more likely to kill you than getting electrocuted in the example at hand.",1332209410

6865257,comment,6865020,6865020,7,0,patmcc,,,"To the cost argument: to say &quot;it would be hard to manage efficiently&quot; makes it looks like most first-world countries don&#x27;t already have a massively successful income tax collection program of some kind. They do. Tax rates could be set so anyone at the minimum income wouldn&#x27;t pay; anyone at that level to &quot;middle class&quot; (or whatever) would pay back part of it in taxes; and anyone above a certain level would pay back more than the minimum income. Would some people be taking home less overall? Yeah, sure. Same as any other welfare service.<p>As for the idea that people won&#x27;t work anymore and society would crumble - people like xboxes and new iphones and clothes and nice cars and even feeling productive.

I&#x27;m not critiquing the use of low entropy passphrases (though if very low then they become useless) - as I said in my blog post:<p><i>... a passphrase is most useful if you can remember it and use it. While having 100 bits of entropy is something nice to shoot for, one has to look at their threat models and decide if it’s worth it. Is having a passphrase 8 words long really the price you pay to keep hackers out of your lolcats.rus account? Maybe yes, maybe no. The truth is, for most web accounts, 100 bits of entropy is overkill.</i><p>My point is that there is no advantage of relying on a passphrase you don&#x27;t know the entropy for, since it&#x27;s usually lower than what you thought, and there are methods of generating memorable passphrases that you can actually measure the entropy.<p>I guess I just don&#x27;t understand why one would ever let their security rely on the incompetence of a potential attacker, instead of relying on the math, when they&#x27;re both basically just as easy.",1386385035

But a couple of points are substantive if not substantiated. For example:<p><i>But if you means-test it to control the cost, or try to tax most of the benefits back for people who aren’t low-income, you rapidly lose the efficiency gains and start creating some pretty powerful disincentives to work.</i><p>Why? I can see how &quot;means-test&quot; might imply bureaucracy and thus inefficiency, but what&#x27;s wrong with using tax policy for this? It seems like an obvious way to ensure that people who don&#x27;t need the money don&#x27;t get it, and no more inefficient as everyone has to fill out their taxes anyway.<p>Come to think of it, isn&#x27;t that so obvious that the debate ought to start there, rather than end there?

E.g. in Australia your effective marginal tax rate while on welfare is around 50%.  For each dollar you earn, you get $0.50 less welfare (and pay a small amount of tax too).<p>Usually high marginal tax rates are associate with a disincentive to work.  However since when you are on welfare, the government makes you report your job-seeking activity, you are forced to try to look for work even though without this monitoring there would be little financial incentive to work.  So having strings attached to welfare allows a higher effective marginal tax rate for people on welfare, and is therefore &quot;cheaper&quot; in some sense.",1386383992

6865173,comment,6864584,6864584,33,0,jeanlucneptune,,,"Assuming this data is from the Medicare (insurance program for those >65) dataset released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services earlier this year (<a href=\"http://go.cms.gov/1bowKJA\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://go.cms.gov/1bowKJA</a>) I have a couple of points to make:<p>1.) Not sure if you grabbed &quot;charges&quot; or &quot;payments&quot;, but &quot;charges&quot; are what the providers (hospitals) billed to Medicare, and &quot;payments&quot; are what Medicare actually paid the providers.  &quot;Payments&quot; would be the best indicator of &quot;price&quot;.<p>2.) Regardless of whether you are using &quot;charges&quot; or &quot;payments&quot;, it&#x27;s pretty much irrelevant for the average person.  Why?  Because the patient never pays the full amount (except for the uninsured...see below).<p>3.) While you don&#x27;t pay the full amount in most cases, you will have to pay something.  However, what you actually pay varies WIDELY based on your health insurer (the &quot;payor&quot;) and the design of the health insurance plan.<p>4.) Also note that every &quot;payor&quot; negotiates a different price, so the Medicare price does not equal the Commercial Insurance price which does not equal the Medicaid price which does not equal the price the uninsured person pays.<p>5.) Finally, the diagnostic/procedural terminology in this dataset is impenetrable to most people.  For example, does anyone on HN know what &quot;transient ischemia&quot; is?  And if you do, do you understand that you can have transient ischemia in many parts of your body (FTR, I&#x27;m an MD)?<p>Although I appreciate the effort and the clean visualization, I don&#x27;t think this data is particularly useful to an individual trying to make health care decisions for reasons 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (and probably others that I&#x27;m missing).<p>The one place where this data may be useful on an individual level is in the case of the uninsured.  When you have no insurance the hospital basically makes up a price (taken from something called the &quot;chargemaster&quot;) that is way more than what commercial insurance would pay, and WAY WAY more than what Medicare would pay.  Having access to this data might help an uninsured person negotiate a lower price when the hospital comes after you with a giant bill.  Medicare is a pretty solid standard to compare to - i.e. &quot;you&#x27;re charging me 5X, whereas you would only charge Medicare X&quot;.<p>On a societal level I think this data is also extremely valuable because now you can start to analyze pricing disparities across procedure types and geographies, which is really helpful.  You can also put pressure on providers who are gouging individuals paying sticker price (i.e. the uninsured), which is important given that medical bills drive the majority of personal bankruptcies.<p>We ran a competition on this topic recently at Health 2.0 and you can learn more about the issue and the datasets on our site.  You can also view other visualizations of this very important data:<p><a href=\"http://www.health2con.com/devchallenge/rwjf-hospital-price-transparency-challenge/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.health2con.com/devchallenge/rwjf-hospital-price-t...</a><p>Transparency in health pricing is a very important topic and something you&#x27;ll hear a lot more about in the future.

The much more just (and effective) tool for achieving the outcome desired by race-based affirmative  action is income-based affirmative action, where income is derived from the person&#x27;s familial income while growing up.  This would effectively cover every person of color in SA anyway, but wouldn&#x27;t persist for those raised without disadvantages in the new post-apartheid gov&#x27;t.  (in other words its a sliding scale)<p>Here in the US, race-based affirmative action punishes Asians more than any others.  Studies show that they effectively have 50 points plus removed from their SAT scores for college admissions.  (There is no allowance made for the fact that they may speak English as a second language and have grown up a laborer&#x27;s child in a poor urban neighborhood)<p>On the other hand, a black American whose parents are professionals making 6 figures will be treated as if he has the disadvantages of an inner city child or a boy raised by sharecroppers.  The net effect is 200 + points added to SAT score (for a male, the effect is dampened for a female).  Make it based on income, and the inner-city child gets the advantage he/she needs, and doesn&#x27;t have his/her spot taken by the child of professionals who went to private schools.<p>FYI: I witnessed this scenario first hand in high school.  A classmate whose father forced him to work on their fishing boat (his family was dirt poor, and his illiterate father cared nothing for education) had higher SAT scores and grades than our mutual friend (mother a lawyer, father an accountant).  Fisherman&#x27;s son was refused admission to the same schools that professional&#x27;s son was accepted into.  Fisherman came from a poor white family AND he suffered from bouts of severe rheumatoid arthritis.  The son of professionals from a privileged background got a welcome mat rolled out for him.

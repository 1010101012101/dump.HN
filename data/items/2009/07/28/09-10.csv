It hasn't hit Beijing or Shanghai in a major way but all the manufacturing cities across the southern and east coasts are taking it pretty hard. There has been a sizable exodus of laid off workers leaving the cities.<p>I don't know what counts as a small percentage to you but exports make up 35-40% of their GDP since 2008. There has been a precipitous drop and changing from an export economy to self-sufficiency doesn't happen in a day. Luckily, the gov't has loads of reserves to weather that storm. But it's still a storm.",1248774739

Plumbing that mental model took a day of wading through some fairly exasperated emails.)<p>A lot of small software developers think that I must be going totally insane with questions like that.  Honestly, no, I could do this forever.  I have two main secrets.<p>One is relentless focus on ease of use, because you CAN find ways to take your existing program, business, and business processes and simplify them so that there are less places to have errors.<p>The other is that you can never have contempt of your users.  Not even quietly to yourself.  Don't call them Help Vampires, even mentally.  You'll poison yourself, you will start to <i>dread</i> the You've Got Mail light, and you will find answering questions exhausting instead of a routine task which you're paid hundreds of dollars an hour to do.<p>P.S.

I've an Indian friend whom Google wanted to hire for their Mountain View office. Since getting a H1B is impossible, they sent him to their Zurich office - he worked there for a couple of years and then finally got a L1 transfer visa and moved to Mountain View.<p>EU is slightly better because it is not a lottery at least.

(I don't do TDD personally so not a big deal for me.)<p>3)  Warble (wonderful software, don't get me wrong) has some performance issues, at least on this computer.  (30 seconds to change one line in one file.)  That wouldn't be a problem except...<p>4) ... I can't get GAE to operate locally with Rails, which means development has to be done by edit, deploy, edit, deploy, edit, deploy, which combines all the development speed of Big Freaking Java Enterprise Apps with the rich your-IDE-will-spot-typos-for-you power of Ruby.  (/sarcasm)<p>5)  You can't use ActiveRecord on GAE, which sounds like a nuisance until you realize how much of Rails magic depends on ActiveRecord being there.  Validations, for example.  (This was a major GOTCHA! for us.)  I hear this will be mooted with Rails 3.0, which allows DataMapper (which will support Google's data store) to be dropped in in place of AR, but it is one of the major issues making me tell my bosses ""The exploratory app was a big success, but the platform is not ready for us to take it to production yet, even though you have one production-ready app sitting in front of you.""",1248772775

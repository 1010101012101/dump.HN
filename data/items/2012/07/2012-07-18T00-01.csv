Only because I know my mail that goes there will arrive relatively quickly, and I haven't had my account hacked by spammers ever with gmail. 
Don't try to make Yahoo mail look like an online version of Outlook, it gets so cramped.

4258734,comment,4254820,4258491,2,0,Kell,,,"You are actually right, the European take on immigration is awfully right winged when compared to American... It's due to the way these nations built themselves. US is a country of immigration, it literally constructed itself upon it. While Europe is a place of emigration, immigrants always were looked upon as strangers lurking around. But France also being a latin country, kept something of the Right of the Soil, mixed with the Right of the Blood from northern and eastern European people.<p>So it's quite bastard... problematic.<p>Your reading is quite unfortunately not totally correct. A child born or not in France is in theory undeportable, even if their parents are from Mars or undocumented (which seems to be the same to some people...). Actually, under 18 it's impossible to be undocumented... because there is no document to authorize a child to live in France, they all have naturally this right. No visa, nothing.<p>EXCEPT (there always a fucking horrible exception), if you came into France without requesting a Visa (that is not needed... but you must request it... go figure...) and entered France coming from another state of the European Union (thanks EU for your horrible immigration law). Then the kid can be sent back to the EU country he came from... which is free to deport the kid if the law of this country allow it. (Well except if he came into France without parents... then he is not deportable again).<p>But then the worse is to come. If the parents are undocumenteds... well, their kid is not deportable... but <i>they</i> are. It's been a long time France dealt with the ""anchor babies""... and in the most hypocrite way. So the parents have a choice : Go with their children, or abandon their children... I kid you not. And I let you imagine what most of parents end up deciding... And no, the answer is not what most fox news talk show hosts would think, since they think that these parents only have those children to have documents. 
It's sad... but we have problems with the far right since much longer than you... the damage they've done to our law is staggering.<p>So the final answer is yes. A kid of undocumenteds born in France, can be deported (""""""""at his parents <i>choice</i>""""""""), and then he will not be able to respect the 5 years requirements, and not be French at all.<p>I hope the actual administration is going to change something about that... but well..

You're also ""voting with your dollar"" and giving society some feedback about what it needs less and more of.<p>When you take something without paying for it, and that thing has a price, then you're saying that society owes you more than what it has judged your own value to be. That price of that object has been set relative to the price of your wages, in a long process of trial and error. Others need to work in order to pay for this thing, but you don't think that you do. That's how I see it from a moral standpoint.<p>I'm not following your train of thought in the second paragraph, but the statement ""copying is needing"" needs more qualification. And on the topic of needing: if you truly don't need something, then you should in fact let society ""cut the fat"". But if there was no one to make the software that you pirated, and if you actually never got to use the thing which you claim (I think) not to need, then would you have been just as happy? I think, if you use something that you ""don't need"", then you're just lying.<p>My own restaurant analogy for this is that piracy would be like a very stupidly run restaurant opening a free all-you-can-eat buffet out back, in addition to a full price menu. In the absence of a disincentive, no self-serving person would pay full price.<p>The supply of copyable software is infinite, but not the supply of time needed to make it. In order to make sure that B isn't undervalued, we can do any of the following:<p>- Artificially limit supply of A (drm).<p>- Find someone who values A more than you do (advertisers).<p>- Make people pay for B rather than for A (kickstarter).",1342571200

Our first title, Leo's Pad, is for 3- to 5-year-olds, and eventually we'll build titles to cover the entire 3-11 year age range.<p>We've just graduated from the StartX accelerator program (http://startx.stanford.edu) and closed a round of funding, and now we're looking to build our core team.  We've got multiple Stanford Ph.D.'s in learning/neuroscience, an Emmy-winning creative director, and Pixar-level animation (literally--our animation studio makes movies for Pixar), and we've already built a pilot ""appisode"" of our first title that has impressed even the most jaded VC's.  What we're looking for now is the person/people who will lead the design and building of a complex tech stack.<p>All the usual things apply (equity stake, great salary, great culture, lots of ownership).  What distinguishes us as a company to work for is our mission: we'll be trying our best to transform the way young children learn and the way parents interact with them.  So we're looking for folks who (a) have young kids or (b) are passionate about early learning or (c) are just playful by nature.  The specific roles we want to fill are...<p>- Director of Engineering: Design and oversee the building of everything from client (tablet app) to website to server-side frameworks for intense data analysis; we've got some of this built, but there's much yet to be done.<p>- Psychometrician: If you know what this term means, you might be a good fit. :)<p>- Game designers: This is where the playfulness and passion for young kids is paramount.  We'll be building entirely new gameplay models for young learners--way beyond the digital worksheet/quiz/flashcard paradigms that are dominant in early-learning apps today.  (My Ph.D. was in game-based learning; I've got great big ideas for this space.)<p>- Developers: We want folks with experience iOS, lua, cocos2d-x, Unity, Java, Python, SQL--but also folks who want to participate in the creation/design/storytelling process.<p>- Creative Production Manager: Provide general quality/continuity assurance for all game elements; manage asset pipeline from animation studio; and pitch in with storyboarding, sprites, etc. if possible.<p>I know that HN has lots of solid people reading, and I'm hopeful that even if you're not personally interested you may know people who might be interested in learning more about opportunities with us.  If so, please pass this post along to them!<p>Thanks,
Dylan (darena at kidapt)",1342570136

Email, messaging, photos, news, small games. Yahoo is strong in every one of these and more established across the board than all its competitors.<p>She can leverage Android/Ubuntu because she knows plenty of Unix developers, Amazon is paving the way for non-Google Android products, and the new Ubuntu mobile OS is pretty amazing.<p>She can leverage Flickr. This is Yahoo's golden answer to Facebook's Instagram, a $1b equal. Imagine a Yahoo phone with built-in Flickr upload and sharing.<p>She can leverage Yahoo media content alliances to provide a great content-driven phone, with news, music, and movies. I daresay Yahoo can pull ahead of even Apple and Amazon on these fronts.<p>She can leverage social networking: Yahoo Instant Messenger is a leader, Games is a leader, and Social Bar had 90m users and was a significant leader of Facebooks Open Graph.<p>She can leverage Yahoo mail. Yahoo is still a huge player in email, ahead of Gmail in terms of users and IMHO interface as well.<p>Manufacturing and distribution can be outsourced. HTC is great for this. Start with a small phone, 3G, for mom and pop, and a $99 price point. Compete with the iPhone on price, and with Google phones on content. Subsidize like Amazon Prime.<p>Most important, Yahoo needs a rallying point-- a bold vision , something amazing to attract top developers and bring together diverse properties. The best way to do this is to go big.<p>If you're a mobile developer, who do you look to for leadership right now? Google/Android is splintered, Microsoft/Nokia seems DOA, Apple/iOS is walled, Facebook is admittedly behind, and Amazon is just gearing up.<p>Mobile is where all the action is happening, and it's where all these big competitors are going as fast as they can-- yet none has the mobile space well entrenched yet. This is Yahoo's perfect opportunity to bring it all together, to hire and inspire developers, and build a world-class integrated product.

8780728,comment,8778566,8780399,0,0,adventured,,,"Well let&#x27;s examine the overall. I&#x27;d say for now it has been immensely profitable, even though I dislike the program.<p>1) QE has held down the cost of US debt, probably saving a trillion plus in interest payments the last five years alone.<p>2) QE has devalued the real value of foreign held debt. Eg China + Japan&#x27;s $2.5+ trillion in US debt they&#x27;re holding has lost a lot of real value courtesy of QE. That&#x27;s less that has to be paid back in theory (it won&#x27;t be paid back in reality). Saving hundreds of billions regardless.<p>3) A lot of dollar assets are held overseas (and of course commodities trade in dollars), but the primary beneficiary of the dollar-based asset inflation program has been the US stock market and US real estate market. Foreigners are partially subsidizing, via the dollar global reserve standard, a huge rebound in US asset prices. It&#x27;s a form of redistributing wealth from the rest of the world that uses dollars, back to Americans that own real estate or stocks.<p>In effect while the economies of Japan and most of Europe have been in ten year recessions in real terms, they&#x27;re paying for the US economy to be doing relatively very well right now. All partially accomplished by the US Dollar standard, that can be freely abused by the Fed to prop up the US at the expense of the massive foreign dollar holdings.<p>4) QE has been partially paying for government employment, welfare benefits, social security, military employment et al. If the US couldn&#x27;t have used QE to fund the huge hole in its budget, the US Govt. would have been forced to divert a large amount of money to paying higher interest to draw in buyers for that debt (or the US Govt would have had to slash its budget big time). Instead, the US was able to keep people floating in jobs or with food stamps or whatever, people who otherwise would not have been ok at least near-term, and the net cost of them not being ok would have been even higher long-term than the cost of the last five years.<p>5) The US residential housing market alone has gained something like $10 trillion in value since the bottom, due in part to the Fed&#x27;s program of holding down interest rates. That gain drastically offsets the cost of QE. However, QE also helped inflate the stock market substantially, according to the Fed&#x27;s own words on the matter, so there&#x27;s a few trillion dollars more. The asset inflation side of QE has been wildly successful so far - the primary question is whether everything will ultimately have to crash back down, post QE and or with higher interest rates.",1419191996

But since there are so many things to learn, I have the choice of learning many things superficially (the default when something new catches my interest daily), or really digging in and learning something in depth.

No wonder they rarely self-identify. Individual members of the Republican party are probably any one of those or more. But nice to see such a nuanced discussion.<p>Let&#x27;s put to rest the idea they&#x27;re far right. Far right generally have strong elements of authoritarianism, anti-democracy, and anti-integration. Republicans are probably the loudest integration proponents and seem to demand an unreasonably fast integration of (Spanish-speaking) immigrants. Their voter registration efforts are not anti-democratic, many other countries have strict voter registration requirements and are still considered fully functioning democracies (for example, the UK which has fines for not registering and requires a fixed address unless you want to fill out a declaration-of-connection form). Republicans have been firmly against authoritarianism (at least while they don&#x27;t hold the executive office). The tell tale signs of far-right are not present in the Republican party.<p>They&#x27;ve been proponents of DARPA, the national labs, and NASA. Even if some members spew anti-science agenda, they&#x27;re actions speak differently. Right now they&#x27;re crying loudly about a plan to rate universities on a set of federally defined criteria, which would in practice limit the freedom of university&#x27;s to teach as they please. That is, in essence, a defense of academic freedom.

Some employers try to make you feel that you are changing the world and what not, trying to say that it&#x27;s not all about money, but well, it largely is about money.

I&#x27;ve done it.  it might even be easier without being famous, unless by smart, you mean &quot;Smart, tall and well-spoken&quot;  or &quot;Smart, tall, and able to hold the right kind of conflicting ideas in your head without emotional distress&quot; - which is often what VC seem to mean by smart.   I mean, don&#x27;t get me wrong, a lot of the ycombinater kids I&#x27;ve met really seemed pretty smart, but they also had the social bits you need to be good business people, and if you demand those social bits along with the &#x27;smart&#x27; - and you should, if you are looking for business people and not just technical people - those people become dramatically more difficult to find, and when you do find them, they&#x27;re difficult to be friends with, as you said, unless you are very high status, because they are very high status.<p>If you just want someone with a high G, though, and are okay with people who are short or shy or fat or who have emotional issues, as you should be if you are looking for people who can become good technical people,  G alone does not confer much by way of status in this society.     I&#x27;ve hired more than one person who tests two standard deviations better than I do by that measure.   hell I&#x27;ve dated a few people who test two standard deviations better than I do.<p>Now, PG, I imagine,  when talking about making investment decisions, probably is talking about &quot;vc smart&quot; -  people who are smart, but also good looking, who have good attitudes and who have the other business person attributes, so in the context of this article, you&#x27;re probably right.  but I&#x27;m just saying, smart people usually aren&#x27;t high status people.  It&#x27;s not hard to get smart friends, if you are willing to skimp on some of the status-granting attributes.",1419188756

If anyone is interested get work samples and vet by giving him/her a short paid relevant assignment.<p>You can also find great remote developers, but vet them with short communication and coding assignments. Github/Linkedin/Dribbble are good resources to find someone remote.<p>Good luck and I hope you find someone well rounded with excellent communication skills.",1419188711

Interest rates are lower, but house prices are higher (good for middle class wealth if you bought before the crisis, bad if you have to buy after the crisis - look at household formation since the crisis to see how that&#x27;s working out).  On balance, banks collect the same  interest, and homeowners have less to spend on anything else.",1419188430

Most of the safety net effect could be achieved simply by removing the link between health cover and employment.  Just do what most of the rest of the world does (where employment status is irrelevant to health cover) and a major disincentive to innovation is removed.<p>Unless of course, the objective is to entrench dependency to large organizations.

They're useful for showing that node has the throughput -- at a low level -- to serve a huge number of concurrent connections, but it doesn't translate directly to huge application throughput if you're relying on things like database access over a network. In practice, each of these problems must be solved individually.<p>I don't mean to minimize this accomplishment. If you're assuming you need 100k database connections in order to scale, you might be solving the wrong problem. Scaling is a matter of moving data as close to the CPU as possible.

Or at the very least I know of one such change in the case of Curiosity.<p>The dust covers over the haz cams (the navigation cameras on the belly of Curiosity) were added in the last minute. Here is the engineer who implemented them writing about the covers: <a href=""http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=29612.msg938852#msg938852"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=29612.msg93...</a><p>Basically, the Phoenix lander (landed on May 25th 2008) kicked up more dust than expected. They were worried and did a review for Curiosity, but found out that only the haz cams (because of their location on the belly) were in danger, so they decided to add dust covers to them (and also kept them transparent to see whether there really was a dust problem  as you could see from the first photos with covers still attached there very clearly was).<p>My guess is that stuff gets changed and updated a) if there is money and resources left or b) if the mission is in danger if you dont change something.<p>The 2MP sensor is very clearly good enough. Any update in resolution would give you diminishing returns  so something like that gets pushed back.",1344519137

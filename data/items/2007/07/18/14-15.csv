34994,comment,34900,34900,0,0,Goladus,,,"I think this depends on what you are looking for in a candidate.  Being able to read code is good, but if you want to hire someone who is really good now and will be 10x better in 6-12 months, you don't want someone who is opinionated and arrogant about what constitutes good code.  You'll want someone who recognizes something doesn't look right and then asks <i>why</i> it wasn't done a better way.",1184769880

Getting the system in your head is important, but this is difficult to test in an interview -- because it might take days, not minutes.<p>My favorite interview question is asking about projects done in spare time. This yields a great deal of information about how inherently interested the person is in hacking.",1184768349

34987,comment,34900,34900,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"This seems too small and specific to matter.\nSure, it is important to manage what is going on inside a loop iterating a million times. But without a good profiling system to know where to work, this could be wasted effort. And good design of a large system will matter more than any single function or loop.<p>That said, you could do a high level system design and get down into a few details. ",1184768035

521428,comment,520679,520911,0,0,ghshephard,,,"The idea on AmieStreet is to constantly scan for new songs, and ""REC"" (Recommend it) - if you catch a song early enough in it's rise up to $0.99 you basically get $.98 per REC that you make (presuming you are able to anticipate the taste or memetic attention of the masses).<p>The obvious attraction on AmieStreet is the sliding scale for music:
   An investment of $18.75 gets you $25 worth of purchases and 26 RECs.<p>If you are half decent at picking music, you usually make between $0.25 - $0.50 with a bit of effort on those RECs - call it conservatively $0.25 * 26 = $6.50 + the $25 = $31.50.  Your average song, if you are an active user and can catch things early averages around $0.35 for the really good stuff (ignoring the large amounts of free to $0.10 cruft that you probably don't want in your playlist anyways) - so $31.50/$.35 = 90 Songs for $18.75 - with the sense of satisfaction that a significant portion of your money is going back to the artist who made the music.  (Do kids still care about that these days - I am so out of touch. :-) )<p>I just picked up ""Live, by Luna"" - a stellar album for $3.22 - in a solid 256 KB VBR MP3 format.  Not to mention I can both
  A) Play the music from the web when I wish to
  B) Redownload if I wish.<p>I guess the big difference between popcuts and AmieStreet is that you are limited to $0.98 * your RECs on AmieStreet, wheras it appears that PopCuts has a higher payout, but a larger payin per song - they are all $0.99 compared to the ""starts at free and frequently pretty cheap"" on AmieStreet.<p>It will be interesting to see how the balance of cheap versus possible greater profit works out for the two sites.<p>Anyways, Congrats to PopCuts for their Best Online Music Startup in Accelerator Competition at SXSW Interactive award!!",1237369114

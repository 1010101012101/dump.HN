Besides why dig so much to fix a small problem and understand big piece of software for long time to improve it by a nanosec.
What rush we get by programming contest problems is the ""ACRush"" as my friend puts it... its amazing to see your fast code getting accepted ""AC"" by an online judge.. and then amazing to see how a faster program gets you a better rank... these joys arn't there in world of freely contributing to open source...
this joy is like a high.. which makes us crave to be able to solve MORE and MORE :)
anyways forget that my point is
won't it be amazing if fixes/problems of opensource projects are also converted into programming contest style problems and you get to get the fastest and the best code for open source projects and we get the RUSH as we call it ?
and later you can always pick us up for a job ;P",1220547579

For example, if you have IE7 and you want to test IE6 so you install the IE6 standalone, the IE6 standalone will use the IE7's rendering engine.  This is OK in most cases, but if you want to test some tweaks that you use for IE6, you will be at a loss.  For example, I wanted to use this PNG fix: <a href=""http://www.twinhelix.com/css/iepngfix/demo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twinhelix.com/css/iepngfix/demo/</a> which is pretty much essential for IE6 if you want PNG support -- it won't work on the IE6 standalone.

They aren't always the best, but in many instances they can teach you a lot more than just the topic at hand. If you have your grammar school science textbooks at one end of the spectrum---nth hand knowledge echoed by an author with no understanding of the subject---then original works are at the opposite end---the idea in its first appearance, recorded by someone with the power necessary to understand and discover it for the first time. The advantage isn't only in that the author takes great pains to present his new discovery, it's in the countless unrepeatable ways he presents it dictated by the climate of his time. Just like there will never be another 17th century Italy to produce those particular violins, there will never be another Victorian Era to produce <i>On the Origin of Species</i>, in the way it was originally written. You can rewrite and distill the idea, but you can't recapture all the implications that originally flowed from it.

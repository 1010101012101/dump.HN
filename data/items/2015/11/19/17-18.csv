You insert it into a smart card reader and then visit the restricted-access website.  Your browser/OS prompts you for a PIN which, I believe, is used to decrypt your private key.  Your browser validates the remote site against a set of DoD-provided root certificates that you configure on your computer before hand.  Then, some kind of key exchange happens--this has always been a bit fuzzy to me--and the keys on your CAC card are used to authenticate you to the remote site.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect, of course.  You can lose your CAC card and then you&#x27;re screwed unless you have a way to get new one.  It requires a smart card reader which is not standard on most computers.

I would expect to see Square drop precipitously over the next week/month as the professional investors can make money by pushing the valuation down, then it&#x27;ll stabilize somewhere near the IPO price in 6-12 months. Company fundamentals have very little to do with share price in the first year or two of an IPO; it&#x27;s almost entirely psychological.<p>And nobody&#x27;s been claiming that late-stage investors are dumb; in fact quite the opposite. Late stage investors tend to be very large, professionally managed equity funds - they are as savvy as investors get, and they&#x27;re strong-arming early stage investors into unfavorable liquidation preferences.

I even want to dedicate my life to help building privacy enhancing technologies and censorship-resistant networks. Because I think that an &quot;advanced&quot; world can only thrive if information is unrestricted, or unstoppable.<p>But today I face a dilemma. The dilemma of choosing between freedom and privacy, and security.<p>I am French, and have a lot of family in Paris. My brother lives two streets from the Bataclan and lost one of his friends. Some of my friends lost 5, sometimes 10 people that night. Imagine loosing two thirds of your group of friends in a few hours. This is frightening.<p>When I look at France. I see a great country, with a lot of humanity and when I look at the French, I see a freedom loving people who share a love for good food, good music and generally speaking, the good things that life has to offer.<p>But I also see the failure of my country in the suburbs. With entire neighborhoods that have been left uncontrolled by the government at some point, and who never went back to that state despite lots of efforts. These neighborhoods are rigged with crime and violence, and have been a fertile environment for religious lunatics to grow stronger for the last twenty years.<p>And I have mixed feelings. The French National Assembly has extended the state of urgency to three months. Strengthening the regalian power of the state and weakening the counter-balancing power of the Judicial branch.<p>Hundreds of raids have been coordinated through France, most being in those &quot;uncontrolled areas&quot;. And it seems to work.<p>Which prompt me to think that this might be for the better. For the most part of my &quot;short&quot; life, I have thought that a people should never &quot;trade freedom for security&quot;. But I have come to the, perhaps wrong, conclusion that there can&#x27;t be &quot;freedom without security&quot; either.<p>Maybe we should give up some freedom to let the &quot;good guys&quot; crackdown hard on the &quot;bad guys&quot;.<p>But maybe it isn&#x27;t.

Is pure functional reactive programming suitable for ambitious UIs ? I do not think so.<p>React has its own set of flaws but at least I believe it nailed the state problem: Encourage the minimization of local state but still make it easy to have some when necessary. I like functional programming a lot but I think this is a case where good old object oriented encapsulation provides a more pragmatic solution.<p>There are all sorts of transient states that a parent&#x27;s component shouldn&#x27;t have to care about (Whether I currently have focus, a transient list of changes not yet committed that should be thrown away should I navigate away, is the calendar drop-down opened?, etc, etc) Elm makes it hard to have truly rich and reusable components for that reason as all that transient state must leak to the parent components.<p>But that&#x27;s still doable at least, if cumbersome; some other things simply appear impossible, like coding a ReactTransitionGroup equivalent. This React component encapsulates the concept of a changing-over-time list of children and animate in/out the children that changed across two redraws. It needs to know about the previous list of children to diff it with the new. It needs to manipulate the actual Virtual nodes passed to it so that it temporarily leaves the exiting nodes till their animation finished, etc. This thing has tons of state and it needs it to do its job; and it&#x27;s fine. How would you do this in Elm without leaking the abstraction at every call site ? (I&#x27;m looking for a pragmatic, easy-to reuse by everybody solution, not some convoluted sliding Signal of component lists ;-)  )<p>I&#x27;m wondering whether performance tweaks should be the focus right now; Elm already had good performances. The issue is adoption, and if it&#x27;s too convoluted to write (non trivial) reusable components, I don&#x27;t see how it can succeed. Right now I would never start a complex project with it in fear of getting stuck with a medium-complexity task because the architecture didn&#x27;t foresee my problem.<p>Maybe the architecture provide some escape hatches I didn&#x27;t see, and I would love to be proven wrong.",1447955166

I can then issue my friend bob another share because he gave me a great lunch recommendation and I thought it was a big morale boost, something I can do because you don&#x27;t have a covenant in place.

If they make $70,000, that&#x27;s $15,750 a pop.<p>A state university education in Ohio is $12,000 for 15 weeks by the way.  Other bootcamps range from free to $21000 with median around $8000.

I was reading Grimm&#x27;s Fairy tales to my wife this morning and the brave little tailor used the same clever approach.<p>* * *<p>Leaping into the woods, he looked to the left and to the right. He soon saw the two giants. They were lying asleep under a tree, snoring until the branches bent up and down. The little tailor, not lazy, filled both pockets with stones and climbed the tree. Once in the middle of the tree, he slid out on a branch until he was seated right above the sleepers. Then he dropped one stone after another onto one of the giant&#x27;s chest. For a long time the giant did not feel anything, but finally he woke up, shoved his companion, and said, &quot;Why are you hitting me?&quot;<p>&quot;You are dreaming,&quot; said the other one. &quot;I am not hitting you.&quot;<p>They fell asleep again, and the tailor threw a stone at the second one.<p>&quot;What is this?&quot; said the other one. &quot;Why are you throwing things at me?&quot;<p>&quot;I am not throwing anything at you,&quot; answered the first one, grumbling.<p>They quarreled for a while, but because they were tired, they made peace, and they both closed their eyes again. Then the little tailor began his game again. Choosing his largest stone, he threw it at the first giant with all his strength, hitting him in the chest.<p>&quot;That is too mean!&quot; shouted the giant, then jumped up like a madman and pushed his companion against the tree, until it shook. The other one paid him back in kind, and they became so angry that they pulled up trees and struck at each other until finally, at the same time, they both fell to the ground dead.<p>Then the little tailor jumped down. &quot;It is fortunate,&quot; he said, &quot;that they did not pull up the tree where I was sitting, or I would have had to jump into another one like a squirrel. But people like me are nimble.&quot;<p>Drawing his sword, he gave each one a few good blows to the chest, then went back to the horsemen and said, &quot;The work is done.

Being powerless hurts, and giving us less agency makes us more powerless.<p>Applying to a position to a human similarly gives us agency and power. It&#x27;s a bit of competition.  If we pass or fail, it&#x27;s based on how we did at the interview.<p>We give these things up, and that harms us.  One of the big fears about Communism in the post war era was that the Party would dictate what you did for work and how you would get paid.  This fear came from this loss of agency, but communism still had support in some situations because of the idea that at least in this case everyone would get paid.<p>Algorithmic hiring at its extreme would lead to the same loss of agency in the hiring and applying process. The algorithm would be the one that dictated whether you would get a job, and if your ability to get future jobs are dictated by your past jobs, and your past jobs are dictated by the algorithm, you are powerless.  If you&#x27;re really interested in computers but you worked a few summers doing mechanical work in college because that was the work that was available, well, maybe you&#x27;re better qualified to be a mechanic now, so you&#x27;ll never get an opportunity to work on computers.  Maybe it is strictly better for the mechanic shop to hire you than get a new junior mechanic, and maybe it&#x27;s strictly better for the company to hire a person who has more experience in IT.<p>But what if the person that they hire for IT actually wants to be a mechanic, they just had jobs doing IT work? In the same way, the company keeps you on as a mechanic because you&#x27;ve got experience, and it&#x27;s still better for the company to hire someone like him for the IT position.<p>This might be more efficient for companies.  But is it better for people.  My question is really, how do you define &#x27;better&#x27;?<p>It&#x27;s certainly easy to say that it&#x27;s more efficient.  But cold efficiency is the stuff that scared us in the cold war, luckily Communism failed to really take hold because   that cold &#x27;efficiency&#x27; was actually inefficient and people were starving.  However, implementing it in a Capitalist society is even worse, because you get all of the bad that comes with a cold uncaring hand dictating your fate, it probably IS going to be efficient, and you&#x27;ve got no promise that the people left behind after this efficient system is done allocating all the labor that&#x27;s necessary will be cared for.  How will an algorithm rate a person who is 25 and has been unemployed since college?  They&#x27;d certainly be a high risk compared to someone who has been working steadily. Bottom of the pile.  What if that person has been unemployed because the algorithm filtered them out of jobs just because at the time other applicants were better or more suited for the task?<p>As humans, we can take a chance on people like that. We might even know that they&#x27;re not the perfect person for the position, but maybe we&#x27;ll have &quot;a good feeling&quot; about them. We might make a poor hiring decision, but we might elevate a human because of it at the expense of company profits.",1447952862

Bacteria will never evolve as fast as viruses because their reproductive cycles are much longer.<p>The opposition to bacteriophage research comes from the belief that bacteriophage research could accidentally produce viruses that are deadly to humans or be used as a cover for biological weapons research. But these concerns are invalid: bacteria and human cells are drastically different, and so are the viruses that attack them: there&#x27;s no chance that bacteriophages will mutate into viruses that attack human cells.

I&#x27;ve seen no claim that they are are infallible, they just find correlations. If the correlation is not 1, it is measuring some people poorly (false negative).<p>So, you actually do quite well at work, but the test puts you in the low category. You are basically unhirable, or at only a fraction of the salary of your peers.<p>You end up with things like that recent Google hire thing that was all over social media - the author of the package for which they were hiring was declined because he didn&#x27;t pass some whiteboard algorithm thingy. At least that was random - if he interviewed again he&#x27;d have a chance of getting hired. Tests like this would render a section of humanity unhirable.<p>At least now, even though I am subjected to randomness, I can eventually get a job and prove myself. Then I can take that proof and use it to get other jobs. Not in Silicon Valley as a programmer, perhaps, where they ignore your resume in favor of &#x27;solve this 20 year problem in 30 minutes on a whiteboard while you pretend you didn&#x27;t just study this and are working it through for the first time&#x27;, but in the rest of the world.",1447952519

Yes, you need good credit, some assets--and poof--you have money to invest, without the competition you had pre 2008.   I look at these low interest rates for only the best clientele, and I wonder, &quot;How can they lose?&quot;<p>In my neighborhood, I see qualified individuals(rich people), and REIT&#x27;s buying up residential homes at a rate I have never seen before, and why shouldn&#x27;t they at these rates.<p>While the middle class, and the poor are slowly losing any savings they managed to put away.  Rebublicans blame Dodd-Frank--I don&#x27;t know, but something is not right.<p>There&#x27;s a part of me that wonders if we, the poor/middle class were better off when financial institutions didn&#x27;t know our blood type when applying for a loan, or credit?  It just seemed like more people were allowed to invest in the past?<p>What do I know?  Nothing!  Guess I&#x27;m feeling the holiday slump?  I hope it doesn&#x27;t last too long?",1447952483

It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever put an honest effort into learning a pure functional language, and although it was initially frustrating to a self-taught programmer with a background in several procedural languages and SQL, it&#x27;s growing on me, and I&#x27;m probably going to look for a side project (maybe a small game or a simple CPU simulator) to build with ELM when the course is over.<p>I only wish the &quot;Improved error messages&quot; and &quot;Catching more bugs&quot; features had been introduced about three months ago, probably would have saved me hours!",1447952441

6592771,comment,6592076,6592076,1,0,adolgert,,,"Is there a significant ethical difference between purchasing from a store or from a large online retailer? In one case, shipping to the store is bulk, and employees may make low wages, but they interact with other people. For a retailer Amazon&#x27;s size, warehouses run on people who read orders from handheld devices and are timed for retrieval speed per box filled. Then shipping is done per parcel. How have you decided what&#x27;s the right behavior to encourage with your dollars?",1382457546

I don&#x27;t want to pay the price of living in a &quot;tech city&quot;. I&#x27;m even tired of wasting money on clothes for an office as I am a 41 year old jeans and t-shirt kind of guy. Some people just don&#x27;t have the discipline of not being constantly supervised and have that &quot;must be at the office to be productive&quot; thought pattern. I am not a 9 to 5 person (and most companies have changed it to &quot;you must be a 8 to 5 person&quot;). There is just too much time and money wasted by going to someone&#x27;s office if you don&#x27;t need to. I was the only iOS developer at my previous employer. I barely had to collaborate with the business as much as you might think. Most of our communication was done via email, wikis and bug tracking tools. I couldn&#x27;t understand why I had to be there. It was basically just an obstacle I had to overcome very damn day. I&#x27;m currently searching for new work and so many positions are downtown (Atlanta, in my case). I just won&#x27;t deal with 1 hour commutes. Gridlock is just a horrible place to waste one&#x27;s life.",1382457499

6592755,comment,6587752,6591433,1,0,keypusher,,,"I am quite new to both topics as well, but it seems like there are some similarities.  That is, from the excerpt in the original article, the PRNG used by /dev/random essentially takes noise from some external input, and runs it through &quot;a cryptographic function that outputs random numbers from the continually internal state&quot;.  In both cases (cryptography and random numbers,) the goal is to transform known data into something that is indistinguishable from random.  The way I understand it is that the entropy in the random number generator doesn&#x27;t come from the algorithms, entropy comes from noise gathered off the hardware signals.  The algorithms just make sure that even if you have biased noise generating the input, attackers will still have a very hard time using that to control the end result.  I think this a very interesting question by the way, and hope my previous answer didn&#x27;t come off as dismissive.  I am still a novice in the world of security, and so I wanted to put links in instead of trying to explain this myself, as I probably would get it horribly wrong.",1382457453

Mayer essentially hit the reset button to regroup and figure things out again, and she has specifically talked about her action having little to do with actual remote work, and more to do with trying to get the organization back on track. Sucks for the employees of Yahoo, but, to put it bluntly, they were the employees of Yahoo. So long as you work for someone else, they get to make those decisions.<p>And her action then kicked off many others to read <i>way</i> too much into it, usually to springboard off for their own interests.

This isn&#x27;t to say they&#x27;re not dedicated or passionate, but when you&#x27;re putting in 60 hour weeks bug fixing or implementing small features here and there, you run out of time to go read some books about your development language of choice.

They all assume the contemporary system of public schools, classrooms and standardized testing is correct and simply needs refinement.<p>This is incorrect, in my mind. Compulsory schooling is an obsolete remnant from the days of Prussian militarism, and later revived by the large industrialists so as to breed a workforce that will fill the necessary quotas for such a society to work.<p><i>The day of combination is here to stay. Individualism has gone, never to return.</i><p>-- John D. Rockefeller<p>-----<p><i>We want one class of persons to have a liberal education, and we want another class of persons, a very much larger class, of necessity, in every society, to forego the privileges of a liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific difficult manual tasks.</i><p>-- Woodrow Wilson<p>----<p><i>In our dreams, we have limitless resources and the people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hands. The present education conventions fade from their minds, and unhampered by tradition, we work our own good will upon a grateful and responsive rural folk. We shall not try to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or men of learning, or men of science. We have not to raise up from among them authors, editors, poets or men of letters. We shall not search for embryo great artists, painters, musicians nor lawyers, doctors, preachers, politicians, statesmen, of whom we have an ample supplyThe task we set before ourselves is very simple as well as a very beautiful one, to train these people as we find them to a perfectly ideal life just where they are. So we will organize our children and teach them to do in a perfect way the things their fathers and mothers are doing in an imperfect way, in the homes, in the shops and on the farm.</i><p>-- General Educational Board, Occasional Papers No. 1, 1913<p>----<p>So on and so forth.<p>Compulsory schooling was never about intellectual satiation or real learning, but to instill a Pavlovian routine and to raise citizens within a framework that rulers at their respective times see fit.<p>All attempts at educational reform that try to &quot;fix&quot; the problem within the confines of the current system are doomed to failure. It&#x27;s insane just how well people have been raised to think that classrooms and strict routines are the only conceivable way to educate people. Not so, and the famous quote &quot;I have never let my schooling interfere with my education&quot; rings even truer today.<p>Nowadays with the rapid technological advancement of society, the necessity to abandon antiquated and ineffective compulsory schooling practices and replace them with more natural concepts: free schools, democratic schools, the deinstitutionalization of pedagogy, is more critical than ever.<p>But most important is to breed a strong feeling and desire for autodidacticism in people. This is what is truly lacking. Achieve this, and the problems will be solved more smoothly.<p>To figure out more about where I come from, read the works of John Holt, Ivan Illich (<i>Deschooling Society</i>), John Taylor Gatto, Charlotte Iserbyt and others.

That&#x27;s may be useful if you are watching a movie and don&#x27;t want other displays to annoy you, but it&#x27;s really annoying if you just want eg. Mail full screen on a secondary monitor.<p>2) Mac OS Lion also added a feature named &quot;Spaces&quot; (I think this is called virtual desktops or so on other platforms). The problem is that when you switch between spaces, both screens switch simultaneously. Now let&#x27;s assume you use your secondary monitor to show an IM client, or to show some live error log, or similar, it&#x27;s really annoying if that disappears when you switch between spaces on your main display.<p>So OS X 10.9 finally makes two features introduced in 10.7 (Full screen mode, spaces) usable for people with multiple monitors.",1382456518

I live in NY and occasionally some stuff would come next day air from say Arizona at probably a large loss for Amazon.  Recently though they took the 3.99 next day option away from items that they do not have located in my warehouse (PA).  Then the 2 day items do not ship directly from the other warehouses, they must have trucks going from KY to PA and then UPS takes final miles. Previously I would get 2 day items direct from other warehouses.<p>So I think they are transitioning to a system where they maintain stock in every warehouse, and every warehouse is within 2 days UPS ground to everyone in USA. If you ship things to Amazon for Fulfilled by Amazon they want you to ship to at least 3 warehouses.  Prime is a major reason I buy everything from Amazon.  Often I can find goods at lower prices from other retailers online but the free second day shipping that is always on time cannot be beat.<p>So this latest super saver shipping change I think is Amazon basically making shipping free due to its superior distribution system.  Paying UPS for to door delivery from nearby warehouses for all these items is most likely less money than it costs stores for rent and other costs associated with brick and mortar.",1382456514

One may manipulate through direct force, emotional means, whatever it takes.  It is a waste of time and irritating -- perhaps condescending in that it is an obvious manipulation? -- to say things like, &quot;Let me first say I&#x27;ve learnt a lot from you, I really appreciated your view on this that and that. I think you are smart person blablabla&quot; before getting to the point.  Like you said, it distracts from the actual important points of the argument.  In fact, such an approach towards discussion is, as you point out, counter-productive.<p>You&#x27;re right.  It&#x27;s manipulation.  Building consensus, too, is a form of manipulation.  Some of it is irritating, especially if it is delivered in the form you quoted.  My hackles rise, too!<p>From your comment, I am seeing that the real issue is when the manipulation is overt, when someone expresses something in a way that is clearly intended to push you in a direction rather than actually respect and accept your buy-in.<p>But that leads me to seeing that this really just another form of pathos.  In a conversation, the average person wants to feel respected, that their opinion has merit.  This is part of rhetoric.  In fact, where action and tone are lacking, some people may genuinely need the additional words of appreciation that set you and me off.  My point is that logos is not the only valid appeal, and I would propose that nobody is absolutely rational, meaning that degrees of the other forms of persuasion are acceptable and useful means.<p>To address your first point, all persuasion is manipulation.  Somewhere I read that all speech is a form of persuasion, though the reasoning behind this assertion may be a bit contrived.  Instead of elaborating on that point, I want to suggest instead that even if it is not &quot;all&quot;, even if it is just &quot;most&quot;, we could see instead that manipulation is not an evil in itself.  Clearly there is nothing wrong with asking somebody where they would like to eat as your means to coerce them into joining you for dinner.  Obtaining consensus or bringing someone to agree with you is not, itself, an evil or even irritating.<p>Armed with all the appeals of rhetoric and following these steps with respect to the audience&#x27;s needs, I think the four steps listed at the top of the thread are acceptable means in polite society of persuasion, or, if you prefer, manipulation.<p>Addendum: I just tried the four steps.  Was this post a successful example?  Did I overdo it?",1382456176

So a 90% chance of doing business with ONE company is as Statistically close to 100% that it might as well BE 100% for economic purposes.<p>Once a company hits 75% or so they have no &quot;economic need&quot; to write restrictive exclusive contracts as they basically control the market.  Remember, the RULES OF FREE MARKETS assume there are ALWAYS enough buyers and sellers that NEITHER side has a group large enough to independently affect the market prices.

6592426,comment,6581987,6587176,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">First, let me repeat that I am not claiming that taxation drives no behavior. I&#x27;m saying that the degree to which it drives behavior is frequently overstated.<p>And I think you are underestimating how much it does drive behavior. Rational economic actors will do what they can to avoid costs, including taxes, right up to the point where the cost of avoidance measures exceeds the cost being avoided. When you impose a significant tax rate (e.g. 25-50%), you make it rational to spend significant effort on tax avoidance, all of which is wasted resources that could have been put to some other more productive use.<p>> What I am saying, however, is that many (including you) opine that individuals/corporations will suddenly begin to engage in completely irrational or counter-productive behavior because, you know, taxes.<p>Nonsense. The behavior is completely rational -- it&#x27;s just massively inefficient. Companies will spend several million dollars to build a &quot;presence&quot; in Ireland or Bermuda or wherever else. They will hold wealth off shore rather than repatriating it. Companies do such things because it is less expensive than the taxes they&#x27;re not paying. It is completely rational to do that, even though it would be &quot;irrational&quot; otherwise.<p>> Except that the net income that flows to me is greater as a shareholder.<p>No it isn&#x27;t, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying. Let&#x27;s put some numbers into it. Suppose the company has 100,000 outstanding shares valued at $100 each at the beginning of 2000. They do well from 2000 to 2010 and make ten million dollars in profits, so now their shares are worth $200 and the company has ten million dollars in cash on hand. Let&#x27;s go through what they can do with the ten million dollars.<p>First, they could issue it as a dividend. So you get a $100 dividend and now instead of having a $200 share of stock you have a $100 share of stock and $100 (because you can&#x27;t get something from nothing -- having issued the dividend the stock value goes down because the company has less cash on hand), a total value of ~$200. Now all the stockholders have to pay tax on $100/share, even the ones who just use the dividend to buy more stock because they like the company.<p>An alternative is for the company to buy back some of its own stock. So the company buys back ten million dollars worth of outstanding shares. All the shares continue to be worth ~$200/share (because even though the company has less cash on hand after the buyback, there are now that many fewer outstanding shares, so each remaining share represents more of the company). At this point the stockholders who tendered their shares in the buyback don&#x27;t pay taxes on the money they receive, they only pay tax on the difference between what they received for the shares and what they paid for them (which no matter what it was will have been less than the full amount). Now you may object that you don&#x27;t want to sell your shares, you just want the profits as cash, so I&#x27;m going to explain how this is the same thing. The company is transferring the same percentage of its total value to the stockholders either way. If they pay a dividend, you get the money, and you own the same percentage of the company that you did originally. If you tender that percentage of your shares to the company in the buyback, you get the money, and you own the same percentage of the company that you did originally (because you own fewer shares of a company that has fewer outstanding shares) -- but now you pay less in taxes, and stockholders who don&#x27;t want any cash right now don&#x27;t pay any taxes. And the company can do a stock split so that you end up with the same number of shares you had originally, so that you can do this again and again without ever having to sell the last share. So there&#x27;s that.<p>But let&#x27;s go to one other alternative: Instead of transferring cash directly to the stockholders at all, the company holds the cash as some kind of securities (stock or bonds or what have you) held by an offshore subsidiary. The stock price continues to be worth $200, because the originally $100/share company is still (indirectly) holding ten million dollars of securities. But now they don&#x27;t have to pay corporate income tax on the money, because the profit doesn&#x27;t belong to the U.S. subsidiary, it belongs to the subsidiary in the place where there is no or minimal corporate income tax. If they repatriated the money so that they could buy back stock or issue a dividend they would have to pay 35-40% of it to the tax man. So instead of getting $100 (before you pay your own taxes) you would get $60 (before you pay your own taxes), which is quite a loss. So instead they can just keep holding the money offshore and do a stock split. So you bought a share for $100, the company earned money so that the share is now worth $200, then they do a stock split so that you have <i>two</i> shares each worth $100. If you want cash you can sell a share and get $100 (instead of $60). If you want to avoid taxes then you keep the shares. This is effectively the same result as with a buyback. It isn&#x27;t <i>irrational</i>, it&#x27;s just <i>inefficient</i>. And now as a side effect you can&#x27;t buy stock in &quot;Apple&quot; anymore, you have to buy stock in &quot;Apple + a large pile of unrelated market securities chosen and held offshore by Apple executives.&quot; That&#x27;s <i>bad</i>, but it&#x27;s what the tax system causes to be rational, because the alternative (losing some 35-40% of your profits to Uncle Sam) is &quot;worse.&quot;<p>> If you know of a way to do this as a personal investor, please share!<p>The usual method is to take out a mortgage loan, either on your house or by buying some kind of rental property. It&#x27;s obviously a lot easier for business entities.<p>Your whole premise seems to be that if taxes don&#x27;t produce some kind of irrational fury in an overwhelming majority of the taxpayers then the consequences must be negligible and we shouldn&#x27;t worry our heads about it. A thing can cause economic consequences that are Very Bad without causing panic in the streets or mass casualties.",1382454848

We have standards and value backward compatibility for a reason: it&#x27;s because violating those standards and breaking that compatibility hurts. And it&#x27;s going to become Mozilla&#x27;s problem if they continue down this path, because Firefox will cease to be a viable browser choice for a significant proportion of their potential market.<p><i>Dont blame Mozilla for your poor technology choices. Applets will eventually stop working</i><p>I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re writing as if I personally broke these medical devices. I&#x27;ve never personally worked on any of those projects, I&#x27;m just familiar with them and citing them as examples of why this sort of change is damaging.<p>In any case, people really should get off the &quot;Java applets is a dead technology&quot; bandwagon. Viable replacements using HTML/CSS/JS are very recent developments, and people have been developing web-based user interfaces for all kinds of devices for <i>decades</i>. Of course they&#x27;re not all going to throw out all that work and rewrite everything from scratch. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it, and contrary to your claim, there is no reason those applets must eventually stop working. They&#x27;ll work just fine as long as browsers run Java applets, which they&#x27;ve been doing just fine for many years.<p>Obviously applets will stop working if browser makers deliberately drop support for them even though it&#x27;s been available for a very long time. However, that&#x27;s like saying obviously CSS3 is no use for anything because it&#x27;s not all W3C standardised in stone yet so you&#x27;re stupid if you use it today because it might all be different at some arbitrary point in the future that no-one can predict. You can shoot down <i>any</i> technology, no matter how modern and trendy, with such a generic argument, but it doesn&#x27;t demonstrate anything particularly helpful to do so.<p><i>You broke the medical staff instruments by choosing or maintaining a dead technology thus putting patient lives in danger.</i><p>No, I didn&#x27;t, but if the serious software I work on were medical in nature, you could literally bet your life that I wouldn&#x27;t be letting either Java or Firefox anywhere near it and would be using an entirely different level of engineering practice to build it, as I do for certain projects in other fields where reliability is essential.<p>However, while we build the literally life-or-death systems that way, chances are the word processor, KVM, and, yes, web browser that organisations doing vital work use for day-to-day activities are not developed to the same standards. Breaking them still hurts, if only in efficiency (which can obviously still be harmful in a medical context). Unless you&#x27;re claiming that all software that runs in any medical facility must be developed to the same standards as control software for high-risk, safety-critical systems, again, your argument is so generic that it doesn&#x27;t really prove anything interesting.",1382454597

We love amazon at my house and being Prime members, we are almost ordering everything under the sun from Amazon that we possibly can. Here is why we love it:<p>- The reviews are actually useful. I just bought a 70 inch TV through amazon and the critical and helpful reviews really helped me get going with settings on the TV that would have taken hours to research on google otherwise.<p>- Shipping is superfast. Most items are delivered within a day or two with prime.<p>- Btw, if you are a parent of a baby, then check out Amazon Mom. It is free with Prime membership and gives you further discounts if you subscribe to ordering baby stuff like formula, diapers etc. on amazon. Also we compared the prices and it is almost impossible to beat amazon for these things as well.<p>- No need to go drive to a store. Sometimes I need to buy $10 item for which I might end up spending $2 on gas.<p>- Easiest returns if the need arises.<p>- Not to mention that Amazon prime gives you access to lot of great videos, movies, shows etc as a bonus.<p>One drawback with prime is that not all items are Prime eligible.

E.g.  &quot;Brilliant Pebbles&quot; were entirely unnetworked except for the necessary &quot;GO!&quot; signal, each would look at its view of the the attack and decide which booster it should try to take out.<p>And it ignores its stunning political success: the Soviets, after Brezhnev pretty much bankrupted the country with a return to Stalinist repression and all the money spent on the military, especially the 3 complete armies of armor on down supplied to North Vietnam (one used up piecemeal, one destroyed in the first post-&quot;peace&quot; attack, the final succeeded  because the Democrats stopped supplying the South with ammo), and the Strategic Rocket Forces.<p>The latter of which SDI was going to entirely obsolete in one &quot;generation&quot;; faced with the expense of replacing all that investment, and the loss of first strike capability (you have to count on your enemies defenses working somewhat, <i>and you can&#x27;t pick which warheads make it</i>), threw in the towel.

The median dude will always live in the median house and nothing about this will change it.<p>The primary real estate related effect is a dramatic change in macro societal debt to income ratios which in the long term has some interesting effects on bank assets and liabilities.  Its very much like a stealth interest rate cut, with pretty much identical effects.  The price of real estate will of course increase across the board, because the sellers know the buyers will have more money to pay mortgages with.

From Peopleware [1]:<p>&quot;During the 1960s, researchers at Cornell University conducted a series of tests on the effects of working with music.  They polled a group of computer science students and divided the students into two groups, those who liked to have music in the background while they worked (studied) and those who did not.  Then they put half of each group together in a silent room, and the other half of each group in a different room equipped with earphones and a musical selection.  Participants in both rooms were given a Fortran programming problem to work out from specification.  To no one&#x27;s surprise, participants in the two rooms performed about the same in speed an accuracy of programming.  As any kid who does his arithmetic homework with the music on knows, the part of the brain required for arithmetic and related logic is unbothered by music -- there&#x27;s another brain center that listens to the music.&quot;<p>&quot;The Cornless experiment, however, contained a hidden wild card.  The specification required that an output data stream be formed through a series of manipulations on numbers in the input data stream...  Although the specification never said it, the net effect of all the operations was that each output number was necessarily equal to its input number.  Some people realized this and others did not.  Of those who figured it out, the overwhelming majority came from the quiet room.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a problem with listening to music <i>some</i> of the time.  My concern is that by constantly having the headphones on to mitigate audible distractions, I&#x27;ll miss insights that would directly impact the quality of the work that I do.<p>[1]  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-Edition/dp/0321934113"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-E...</a>",1382454095

Technical feasibility to interoperate is only part of the picture. I clearly said above, that any participant should have an <i>equal</i> ability to interoperate <i>legally</i>. This includes no barriers to enter. License is like a visa to a country - it&#x27;s a barrier to enter (which makes it not open).<p>If it&#x27;s still not clear, license means &quot;only those who can afford can use the encoder&quot; and etc. <i>Only those who can afford</i> is a barrier to enter. I hope this is clear. Open codecs ensure equal accessibility and no barriers to enter. Encoders and decoders are available to everyone equally.<p>Pushing Apple and Co to support open technologies? It&#x27;s only a natural thing to expect, since now they have a disproportionate grip as gatekeepers (in this context - it&#x27;s about controlling codecs with patents). That was the whole point above, and that&#x27;s exactly why Apple opposes it so strongly. It comes back to the same thing - control. You can call it an evil plot on their part, a basic instinct (desire for power) or whatever. But they clearly are allergic to the idea of the open Web, because it leaves them less leverage and makes it better for the people.<p><i>> If you want open codecs to become ubiquitous the next generation is where the fight is now.</i><p>Google does a lot with enabling VPx support in hardware. It&#x27;s more up to OS developers to support it in software now. Hardware (at least mobile SoCs) is shaping up well. With wider usage of WebRTC things will get even better, since WebRTC mandates open [free] codecs (here Apple and Co. didn&#x27;t manage to sabotage it). The next big thing is Daala, which is next generation to both VP9 and H.265. That won&#x27;t appear in hardware soon.",1382454005

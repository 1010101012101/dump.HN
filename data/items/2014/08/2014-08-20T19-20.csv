You can use the stream of items through a pipeline (if deterministic enough) to encode a bit of strings. You can do this without enchanting, because you only need two item types.<p>2. You initialize an instruction decoder and have it sort the item based on type, which then triggers a command block to decode the instruction further.",1408564758

Around 8 km/s of delta-V to be exact.[1] This means that, to make it to the moon, the molecule not only has to reach LEO, it has to be moving at 8 km/s (a pretty insane speed) by the time it gets there. I can&#x27;t imagine any earthly air current moving that fast, in fact it&#x27;s likely impossible because the speed of sound is only 0.35 km/s.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v_budget#Earth-Moon_space_.E2.80.94_low_thrust"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v_budget#Earth-Moon_spac...</a>",1408564546

If you have small apps, and decide you want to move to a monolithic CMS, then you must do The Big Rewrite: the exhausting effort of reproducing all of your funtionality so that it is handled by your one, all-consuming CMS. But when you move from the monolithic CMS to an architecture of small apps, there is no need for The Big Rewrite. Instead you take some small part of your CMS, rewrite it as an independent app, set the app on its own port, use your webserver to proxy the app-on-a-port to whatever URL the CMS was previously using for that functionality, and thus you’ve taken a step towards a new architecture without having to rewrite anything but the functionality covered by your new, small app.&quot;<p>I did not hear the phrase &quot;micro-services&quot; until Martin Fowler wrote his essay in March 2014, but clearly, what I talked about in that essay, 14 months ago, is what we would now call micro-services.",1408563773

That reputation has only been lost in the last 20 years.<p>It&#x27;s only the last two decades, with America&#x27;s collapse into a second-rate welfare state in the French model, with the unemployment and debt to go with it, that a very select few European countries have caught up (most of which are tiny, homogenous and generally locked down on immigration; and the prime example, Norway, only got there due to half a barrel of oil per day per person).<p>Most of Europe consists of impoverished, backwards welfare states.

For example it allows sharing validation code between client and server.<p>It includes HTML based tempting,  bidirectional binding, integration with JAX-RS, bookmarkable Urls, a distributed event bus, mobile integration, and client-side JPA for online storage.<p>My understanding of Errai: It&#x27;s meant for frontend development directly in HTML/CSS and uses Java as a replacement for Javascript. It uses internally GWT but only the compiler and does not include the GWT Widgets hierarchy of components, that has been used in many projects to allow doing frontend development in a object oriented-centric approach.<p>That GWT object oriented approach seems to have been historically introduced mainly for IE6 support, as the same HTML/CSS did not look at all the same in IE6 and other browsers which was a deal breaker for using those technologies directly in many enterprise applications.<p>Today in ever-green browsers the object oriented approach ends up acting more as a not always wanted layer of indirection to HTML/CSS more than help solve browser quirks that are no longer present or that can be solved more easily in other ways (for example by using CSS frameworks such as Yahoo Pure CSS).<p>Errai also does not include GWT UIBinder that allows web development in a mixture of XML and HTML.<p>The framework has been around for several years and it’s at version 3, here is a talk on it -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rz2X667Wk_4#t=850<p>Does anyone has experience with it, comments on the design or insight into why it did not gain more traction until now?",1408563499

During the day you make money from a job, during evenings and weekends you work towards your goal.<p>You constantly borrow happiness from the present and pile it up in the future. And burnout is always at the door and you constantly have to fight against it. Exercise, hobbies, outdoor activities etc. They are all weapons for a fight.

With this, they can have a license server and their distributed team can use it. (Consulting company.)<p>There&#x27;s a few users who just like the convenience of being able to do things like share screens, drop files to each others&#x27; machines, etc. as if they&#x27;re all in the same room. There are other ways to do it, but they find this easy and straightforward and the services are already built into the OS.<p>A few users have security concerns that make them more comfortable with direct file transfer over their own encrypted LAN than with Dropbox, et al. These are medical and financial sector users.<p>But ultimately I think you are at least partly correct. <i>Most</i> things have moved into &quot;the cloud,&quot; so a significant proportion of users have no pressing need for direct connectivity. This makes it likely to be a niche market.<p>Of course you can go further and ask &quot;why has everything moved into the cloud?&quot; There are multiple reasons, but one reason is certainly that direct connectivity is hard. But now you have a chicken or egg problem: nobody builds apps that require direct connectivity because it&#x27;s hard, and there&#x27;s little market for making direct connectivity easier because nobody builds apps for it. Those kinds of catch-22 scenarios are murderously hard to escape, either technically or marketing-wise.<p>One application that doesn&#x27;t fit the mold though is private network backplanes for cloud servers that span data centers and cloud providers. I&#x27;ve got a couple users who have servers on multiple providers on multiple continents (Amazon, Digital Ocean, etc.) and this lets them have a single shared encrypted private backplane with a few minutes&#x27; setup time and no manual configuration.<p>I&#x27;ve considered following that line of thinking and building some kind of &quot;meta-cloud&quot; solution, also possibly integrating with Docker, OpenStack, etc. The idea would be &quot;SDN over WAN and between providers.&quot; I&#x27;ve gotten a few positive comments on that concept, but I&#x27;m at the early stages of exploring it.",1408562355

That is, that function errors on null values and returns false for anything that isn&#x27;t identical to true, so while it <i>does</i> provide a conversion to boolean from any non-null value, anything that isn&#x27;t exactly a boolean &quot;true&quot; (unless I misunderstand what &quot;identical&quot; does) is going to return false on conversion. This is consistent with other writings on booleans in Dart [1]. So it appears that Dart <i>has</i> implicit boolean conversions, but it converts everything that is not the single &quot;true&quot; value to false, so using an expression that never can evaluate exactly to boolean true in a conditional (unless you <i>mean</i> it to be a wordy way to create unreachable code) is never something you want to do.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.sethladd.com/2012/02/booleans-in-dart.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.sethladd.com/2012/02/booleans-in-dart.html</a> &quot;The only value that is true is the boolean value true.

276306,comment,275258,276195,0,0,scott_s,,,"Yes, school is important. As someone who is going into their sixth year as a graduate student, I've given this some thought.<p>School is one of the few times when it's okay to just learn without also producing something of value. What I chose to learn was computer science and some math and physics. In grad school, I've learned a lot about high performance systems. While this knowledge and related skills are highly valued in the real world, very few real work entities would be willing to pay me to acquire it.<p>It's tough to learn this stuff on the side. You really need to devote years to learning to be useful. During that time, you're not producing much of value to the outside world. My PhD dissertation will not represent six years of effort; more like one or two. But it took four years of learning to be in the position that I could do that level of work in a year or two.<p>If you take a CS undergrad, some company somewhere can probably get use of them at their current skill level. But that company will have little interest in paying them to continue learning.<p>Regarding what you put out versus what you put in, that's true of everything.",1218735964

TCP does this just fine, and was designed to do this from the beginning.<p>The problem is that the buffer isn't big enough.  Standard TCP windows top out at 64kb due to field sizes in the header.  This was a lot of data to be going over the wire in the days of 56k frame relay lines.  Unfortunately, in the modern world a connection with a round trip latency of 200ms (not uncommon) and a bandwidth cap of 10Mbps (ditto) is going to need four times that much data ""stored"" on the wire.  The TCP headers don't allow for that, so the transmitter needs to wait to send new data until the long-delayed ACKs come back from the receiver.<p>As the article points out at the bottom, there is a ""window scale"" option to IPv4 that allows for larger windows that is reaching common deployment, and of course IPv6 doesn't have the size limitation in the first place.",1218733277

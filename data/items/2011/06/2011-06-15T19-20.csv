As Gimicky as the controls were on the Wii, it was and is a decent system (granted mine has collected dust for 2 years) but it just didn't have the support to make it a gaming system worth mention in the mind of traditional gamers.",1308167977

When I write essays, I don't care, I write everything and I let Hacker News and Twitter sort out the wheat from my chaff.</i><p>Personally I think this is a bad idea, because what is popular on HN rarely correlates with what I consider to be quality writing. If your goal is just to get an article on HN, that can be done pretty easily: give it a provocative title, discuss one of a handful of topics (e.g., node.js, Clojure, Scala, Rails, Apple/iOS, etc.), and make it easily skimmable within 30-45 seconds.<p>If HN popularity was a reliable metric for quality, TechCrunch would deserve a Pulitzer. If you want to write short pieces that attract the interest of a programmer while their code compiles, HN is a decent metric. If you want to write something with lasting meaning or value, it is not.<p>(Obviously, that isn't to say that <i>nothing</i> on HN has lasting meaning or value -- just that the correlation between lasting quality and HN popularity is weak, at best.)",1308167793

It's not like banks give out trial accounts you could use for this purpose.<p>You'd have to go to the trouble of signing up for a real bank account at each of the banks whose web services you'd like to evaluate.  Then spend the time to try them out and compare.  So even a cursory inspection of a variety of banks' web services would already be a pretty huge hassle.<p>Even if you go to all this touble, you're probably not going to know much more than how intuitive a given bank's web interface is, or if they did something glaringly awful in terms of its usability.<p>You wouldn't know how accessible the interface is under load, or test how well the bank's interface handles the various real-life corner cases you're likely to encounter over time.<p>And how would you test the interface's security?  Is even a reasonably security-aware consumer really going to try breaking in to the bank?<p>The ironic thing is that most users who use online banking probably do care about the web interface and its security, even if they can't articulate it in so many words.  But of them, only a small minority care enough and aware enough of the issues to take the time to comparison shop.  And even then they probably won't find out much.<p>There's an opportunity here for a Consumer Reports style investigation in to the web interfaces of various banks.  That would be a valuable service that could save the consumer a lot of time and hassle, and maybe even do things that a lone consumer couldn't: evaluate interface security.",1308167579

Nintendo has never launched a console at $500. The Wii was noted for being cheap, and I really, really doubt they'd launch this without being able to make it at a similar price point to their previous offerings.<p>>Sure, the Wii U looks impressive. But no Blu-Ray or DVD support? Really?<p>I sure as hell hope not!<p>...okay, maybe not that emphatically. Still, there's a Blu-Ray player built into my TV, and as far as I can tell that's becoming common. I don't need a peripheral to do that for me, and I certainly don't want them to tack on an extra $50 for a capability I already have.<p>Besides, who uses DVDs anymore? It's all about Netflix.<p>>As Microsoft and Sony move ever closer to evolving into that mythological set-top box that does it all, how do you justify buying a presumably expensive console that does just one thing anymore?<p>Because <i>I don't want a set-top box that does it all</i>. It's bad enough (but acceptable) that video games are closed-source; hopefully my media doesn't have to be the same way.<p>>Mario and Zelda brands no longer sell systems in the long term when the competition is so stiff,<p>...alright, my Zelda fanboy is showing, but Skyward Sword is probably going to make me shell out for a console and I haven't bought one in a decade (I habitually use my friends' consoles, though).<p>>They know this, which is why they bend over backwards to assure everyone that they have the support of firms like EA, Activision, THQ, and Ubisoft. But when you're releasing behind-the-times hardware that has features and peripherals completely different than competing platforms, it makes the prospect- and return on investment- of developing much riskier.<p>This I agree with, but on a slightly different point than the author.<p>Last I checked it wasn't close to easy to get a license to develop games for the Wii or 3DS. You have be a big company to afford a site license for the dev kit and you need specialized hardware to load your stuff onto the system. Nintendo doesn't need EA and Ubisoft; for one thing, EA sucks. Nintendo really needs to open up to independent developers. This is where Microsoft really shined with the Xbox ecosystem, obviously bringing some of their desktop expertise to gaming.<p>Forget weirdness worries -- indie devs <i>love</i> developing for unique hardware and odd platforms. Independent game developers thrive on the iPhone App Store. They also built the Facebook application ecosystem. By contrast, large, established firms shy away from developing for unique hardware, because of the uncertainty involved.<p>The proper strategic direction for Nintendo is to stop chasing EA and learn to open up to independent game developers. Even Apple, the infamously elitist company's infamously elitist company, has figured that out.<p>Incidentally, as one other commenter has pointed out, Apple and Google via iOS and Android seem to pose more of a threat to Nintendo than do Microsoft and Sony. Nintendo had an unshakeable stranglehold on the handheld gaming market until the iPhone came along.",1308167488

The 'aha' was that the resulting threads will 'wake up' or 'return' in lexical order.<p>Basically if you transform set L into the time domain, when collecting it back you get it back sorted.<p>Its a fun result, and as an exercise in systems analysis it can be enlightening to look at the impact of timer resolution, thread creation, and ordering, but ultimately the 'trick' is that you've exploited the 'insertion sort' that the kernel does on sleep events. You could try its close cousin ""priority sort"" where you create threads where you set the priority of each to be related to the value 'n' of the element, and all fractionally lower than the parent thread (most UNIXes are not that flexible but some realtime OSes are) then as the last step you 'yield' and the threads print out their contents in priority order and poof they are sorted.

Sometimes it's that I don't know the software well enough, which could either be my own problem or just a reasonable lack of desire to devote my brain to it.

Often abstractions have the benefit of simplification, but it's not a requirement.<p>I migrated a project from MySQL to PostgreSQL last summer, and the project was built on Grails with GORM.  I had to migrate the data by hand (mostly easy, save for a couple of edge cases like boolean columns), and I had to change the jdbc driver.  That was pretty much it.  No rewriting of SQL, no changing of escaping logic, etc.  I tell a lie - the auto-sequence generation stuff of postgresql wasn't playing nice with some of the GORM identity stuff, and my code had made some assumptions that turned out not to be 100% true.

2658671,comment,2657554,2657554,21,0,Benjo,,,"I feel compelled to share my current process of understanding and dealing with my own introversion. Maybe this will resonate with others, maybe not. Where I am right now, it's more important for me to be able to share this than anything else.<p>I ended a relationship recently, partly because we had huge communication issues. Her thoughts were always close to the surface, I tended to think about things for hours before finding the courage or words to express ideas that were important to me. When I finally managed to say out loud what I'd been mulling over, she didn't always take me very seriously or even let me finish my thought before jumping in with hers. This of course made it even harder to open up to her again. I tried earnestly to explain to her that I needed quiet time daily to process my thoughts and that interruptions were lethal to my ability to communicate. In the end she never seemed to accept that this was a fundamental part of my personality and not some excuse I was giving her. Often she would make sarcastic comments like ""Have you had enough quiet time today?"" These relatively innocuous comments hurt me more than most of our arguments, simply because it communicated to me that she truly didn't understand me or what I needed to be happy. Maybe we could have established that communication, but the relationship had gone on too long for that kind of refactoring.<p>After the relationship ended, I suddenly had ten times the social energy. I thought I was burnt out of performing comedy, but suddenly had more then enough energy. I took the time to study social skills and took a hard look at my life and my emotional state. It became clear to me that being introverted had closed me off to not only her, but to all my friends and even family. I realized that my closest friends actually made me LESS social, simply because of the attitudes they held towards meeting new people and society in general.<p>So I started cutting them out of my life. I began a new effort of being more social. I limited my ""deep thought introverted"" time to when I was actually alone. When I was socializing, I made sure that I extroverted the entire time. If I felt the urge to check my phone or zone out of the conversation, I recognized that my energy had run out, excused myself and left. I made new friends who viewed me as a social, outgoing person. Their expectations of me helped my momentum. I forced myself to be open with people. I ignored my tendency to withhold personal information, embarrassing stories, or questions that might make me look stupid. I started bantering more with coworkers that I hadn't been close to before. I started reinforcing the believe that I shouldn't feel the need to hide anything about myself.<p>I was a little confused by the new amounts of social energy I had. My girlfriend had taken up a lot of my time, but after our breakup, I was able to maintain a schedule with at least twice the social hours as previously. Where was I getting all this energy? I realized that what was draining me wasn't being social, it was being uncomfortable. It was the awkward situations, not social situations in general, that were sapping my energy. I couldn't tell the difference because I was in a situation where 90% of my social interactions were uncomfortable for one reason or another. In my relationship, I was constantly worried about giving her the time she wanted to spend with me while giving my time to process my thoughts and work on projects. In general, I was always trying to follow a train of thought in my head, even when out with friends, or in a meeting, or in a friendly conversation, instead of being present and happy to interact with someone else.<p>The biggest benefit to this change in my life has been the increased sensitivity to my own emotional state, including how much control I had over my own happiness at any given time by means of my own posture, facial expression and state of mind. I realized that just wearing a stupid grin on my face made my happier than any of my academic or professional accomplishments. It was as if my introversion had muted me to my own emotional state. I began to recognize that humans are essentially emotional antennas. Evolution has conditioned us to subcommunicate volumes of information to each other. The emotional state of a person is broadcast and received by everyone around them. Extroverts are much more sensitive to this than introverts. Suddenly I realized why smalltalk, politeness, and so many other things I had never given much value were so important. Other people felt the effects of these things a hundred times more than I had. And they couldn't help it anymore than I could help being introverted.<p>The reverse of this is also true, by learning to recognize this, I began to pick up much more how other people were feeling. Connecting with people and making them happy begin to give me as much satisfaction as I've ever had from programming or making something work. I'm beginning to reconsider whether technical work is good for my emotional state, or if I am even cut out to be happy while doing it.<p>Am I truly an introvert? Yes, I still believe I am pretty strongly introverted by nature. Do I think all introverts are closed off? No. I think most introverts, even those more introverted than me, are more successful than I was at maintaining at least a few close friendships. I do believe that learning how to be comfortable in ones own skin is critical to being a happy person. I certainly didn't give this problem nearly as much attention as I should have. If you take anything away from this, I hope that you will consider if you should be giving it more attention in your life as well.",1308166375

2658665,comment,2656788,2656788,24,0,doublerebel,,,"Samsung is combining the true openness of Android with Apple-grade hardware, and keeping it affordable.  No one else can compete currently at this level.<p><i>The Software Advantage:</i><p>Samsung sent a Galaxy S II and sources to the CyanogenMod developers.  They are learning very fast -- the home mod community made very significant improvements to the original Galaxy S, and in direct contrast to Apple (and Apple's hate-and-steal technique of 'innovation': denying feature importance and then stealing said feature from jailbreak devs), Samsung is involving those talented devs directly, at practically no cost to Samsung.<p>With this move they have cemented sales among several thousand android devs/enthusiasts -- a small percentage of total sales, but more importantly Samsung is gaining invaluable software improvements and beta testers at the cost of a device or two.  It also means they're avoiding the bad press that many Android handset manufacturers (HTC, Motorola in particular) have gotten in the past for staying locked-down and not releasing sources.<p><i>The Hardware Advantage</i><p>There is a very important detail the article skims over:<p><pre><code>  ""Well bring the chips, thank you. Unlike Nokia, Samsung 
  designs its own smartphone processors, just as Apple began 
  to do with the A4 chip it brought to the iPhone 3GS.""
</code></pre>
Samsung manufactures that A4 iPhone core chip and the Galaxy's Cortex-A8 is its brother.  If anything, the A4 is a <i>stripped-down</i> version of Samsung's S5 [1].  Samsung again gets to learn and implement tech improvements (this time from Apple) at little or no cost. The Galaxy Tab shares tech with the iPad, and the Series 9 (Macbook Air competitor) mentioned in another comment here [2] is the next example.<p>Also not mentioned is the breadth of Samsung's display advantages.  Now that the screen is the most obvious selling (or dick-measuring) point for smartphones, imho their AMOLED is the one to beat.  They have such a long advantage in this field [3] it is almost impossible for competitors to compete on price for display tech.<p>They have solid worldwide distribution and can basically sell the same handset in every market.  My hope right now is this continues as long as possible!  I'm already lamenting the sale of Samsung's HDD division to Seagate.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4200451/Apple-s-A4-dissected-discussed--and-tantalizing?pageNumber=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4200451/Apple-s-A4-d...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2656958"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2656958</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_light-emitting_diode#Samsung_applications"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_light-emitting_diode#Sa...</a>",1308166333

This might be trivial with simple CRUD apps but with large, complex systems that can be a big undertaking. Not to mention that if you end up spending a significant amount of time using straight SQL instead of the ORM that draws into question the value of using the ORM at all. Not to mention causing maintenance and development headaches down the road.<p>Also, the ""you can always drop down to SQL"" defense of ORMs is extremely weak. It's great that most ORMs are not so intensely broken as to prevent you from not using it, but in general the ""you can just stop using it"" argument is not a strong one. Imagine if C++ was defended based on the idea that you can just drop down to raw machine code if you run into problems with the language.<p>All code has bugs. In my experience ORMs don't save you from having to drill all the way down to native SQL to debug. Then you figure out what SQL changes you'd need to fix the bug and from there you work your way back up to how you'd need to change your ORM config or client code to effect the same thing. ORMs are typically some of the most leaky abstractions of any sort.

The act of starting and doing at even the tiniest scale is the key.  So if you are a designer, design or redesign the paperclip.  If you are a programmer, make something tiny, a single function app, or site.  And yes, like Mr. raganwald has discovered, if you are writer, start small. A sentence, a tweet, a poem, or a blog.  Start small, take small steps, make small bets, but work long.  When your competitors have finished, work on, when your peers have retired, work on, and slowly, piece by piece, amazing things happen.  I believe it's the law of making things.  And I believe it's almost Newtonian in it's truth.",1308165601

There are factorial(N) members in this group, which is pretty bad worst-case running time for a sort.<p>There are many ways to enumerate permutations, and we could probably pick a terrible one there, too, especially if we use  a really naive implementation without any memoization or anything like that we could probably waste all sorts of time.<p>Bonus points for freshly generating the whole list of permutations fresh for each isSorted(applyPermutation(i,list)) test.<p>I think to do much worse you'd probably have to start cheating, throwing in garbage calculations that are merely used to waste time, not steps that anyone would actually think of using to progress towards the solution (i.e. I could certainly dream up a nasty brute-force problem to solve for the index integers used in the inner loop, but that's in the category of deliberate time wasting) - the nice thing about this solution is that it's 100% conceivable that someone that wasn't thinking straight could come up with it and implement it just like this.  Hell, a poorly written Prolog would probably come close to implementing this algorithm if the sorting problem was specified in the right (wrong?) way...<p>There's also always SlowSort: <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SlowSort"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SlowSort</a>, which works by finding the maximum element, then recursively sorting the rest of the list. That wouldn't be so terrible if it weren't for the twist: SlowSort finds each maximum element is by splitting the list into half, sorting both lists (using SlowSort, of course) to read off the maxima, and then picking the bigger one.  I think this still runs faster than N!, but its runtime is guaranteed, whereas when generating permutations you might accidentally hit the right one in the first step (could always work around that by calculating all the lists first and <i>then</i> checking them, but again, that seems like cheating).",1308165198

Part of that I work in a school where I have to talk to teachers, students, and administrators all day for hours on end. Eventually, I just learned how to do it effectively, and I've come to like socializing, especially with interesting people. Which leads me to my point.<p>What I found was that despite me having fun and being confident in talking to people and interacting in group activities, there's just comes a point in my day where I literally just don't want to talk to anyone. Socially (and even physically, albeit to a lesser extent) speaking, I'm completely and totally drained. It becomes almost painful to engage in conversation that I feel isn't too useful or too interesting. And honestly, I kinda want to be left alone so I can just gather myself. Sometimes I need a day, sometimes a week. But ultimately, at some point I need time to recover from the social stimulation of my day.<p>From my experiences, I think that's where a big divide between introverts and extroverts exist. To the extrovert, when an introvert gets into his/her shell so that they can recover socially, it appears as if they may be aloof or bored with you, when in fact, they're just tired. This is especially irritating with friends who constantly ask me if ""I'm okay"" or if there's ""something wrong"". They don't understand that I'm comfortable with silence and for large parts of my day I actually prefer, and it has nothing to do with them.<p>Also, just a side note. Something I found quite funny is that because I feel that I'm an introvert and had to struggle with social anxiety through my teenage years, I now feel like I have to overcompensate in social settings, so I'm generally the one who leads a conversation and pushes it forward. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that there are others who also do this.",1308164887

The idea that a concert would ""drain you so much it will be hard to enjoy"" or that an introvert would have a tough time interacting with a group long enough to go on a rock climbing trip is essentially saying that an introverted person is somehow handicapped, or pushed to their introversion by a type of mental disorder.</i><p>Yep, that's exactly my point.  The label has been embraced as a way to put a positive spin on social anxiety.  I don't necessarily think it's a good way to use the word, but on the other hand, I'm not sure it's accurate to call someone like you who is able to enjoy himself and interact fluently with groups of people an ""introvert.""  The traditional use of the word seems more in line with the idea of an introvert as someone who has an aversion to social interaction rather than a simple preference for other uses of time.  Naturally people tend to rationalize, so it's hard to tell.<p>By the way, I think it's healthy and not entirely unjustified to put a positive spin on social anxiety.  Most of my abilities and good qualities come from the time I've spent alone.  I just don't think it's sustainable to be in complete denial about it.",1308164509

Expect more of this sort of thing in the future. openCL seems a bit wordy to me. I won't be surprised if you lose a few % performance with this, but that's a decent tradeoff I think.<p>In the long term, expect the GPU to go away and be absorbed by the cpu. Just like the FPU used to be an add on chip, and was absorbed into the CPU, so will the GPU.",1308164458

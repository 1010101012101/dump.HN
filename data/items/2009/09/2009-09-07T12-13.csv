    value x : array int = [|1; 2; 3; 4|]
    # for i = 0 to (Array.length x) - 1 do {
      Printf.printf ""%d"" x.(i);

    1234- : unit = ()
    # Array.iter (fun y -> Printf.printf ""%d"" y) x;
    1234- : unit = ()

Basically the entire body of <i>any</i> for loop I would want to make an anonymous function. Then if I cared about the result I could do:<p><pre><code>    # Array.map (fun y -> Printf.printf ""%d"" y) x;
    1234- : array unit = [|(); (); (); ()|]

</code></pre>
Assuming the underlying platform supported it, and the function is pure, that's ""free"" parallelism.",1252327683

    * It doesn't have to be robust

This is really bad advice.  Tests still need to be maintained, so they should be clean and readable like any of your code.  Readable tests can also be invaluable for understanding the module they are testing (especially those tricky parts where bugs once lurked).  I learned this the hard way myself, and worry that this attitude leads people to wasting a lot of time on test maintenance and eventually giving up on testing.",1252325936

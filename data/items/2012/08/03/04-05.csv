Each entry should serve a distinct purpose, and should look different (and look good) next to various other entries.<p>For example: a mid-saturation, mid-lightness violet, say around #793D58, can be used as (1) a dark background for light elements, (2) a text or link colour on a light background, or (3) a shadow for bluish or reddish elements. Knowing how colours are perceived, and how to use them well, drastically reduces the size of a palettethe vast majority of pixel art uses fewer than 20 colours, and fewer than 10 is common.<p>In particular, there is usually no need to create ad-hoc colours for different contexts, such as with LESS colour transformations. These can be useful tools, but they can also create inconsistency because they take control out of your hands. And when it comes to design, I for one prefer not to leave things to chance.",1343969084

There still aren't any buy buttons in any of Amazon's apps (Kindle, Cloud Player or Instant Video). I'd expect Amazon to insist on some flexibility there as a condition of any partnership.<p>More importantly, there are also serious antitrust implications to Amazon and Apple working together against Google: They're established players in digital music, digital video and ebooks and, especially combined, are dominant in all three. Ganging up on Google (which is a relatively new entrant in all three) would be a sure-fire way to attract the attention of the DoJ. There isn't even an argument that the DoJ wouldn't find out or wouldn't be able to gather evidence. They're already pursuing a case against Apple for facilitating agency pricing.

Not seeing UI controls, preferences, or <i>anything</i> that is not relevant to the task at hand can make that task simpler, easier to understand, and more productive.  If you need to see dotfiles, well, you might need to know about man pages or at least that commandline programs take flags.  It's not like they're invisible.<p>There are plenty of examples: video games slowly reveal more skills as you learn and encounter progressively harder enemies. A good app should be usable at first launch (or only require minimal setup). Configuration and advanced features can come later.<p>Another great filesystem level example are OS X app bundles- an entire directory hierarchy appears as a single file/application.  If you need to look inside (not likely), you have to know about right-click or the action widget, but for 99.9% of the time, you see only what you need.  OS X and Windows also both completely hide ""system"" folders in Finder/Explorer as well.<p>Yes, hiding things can be confusing if it's not done right, but the alternative of showing everything always is definitely not the way to go.",1343966637

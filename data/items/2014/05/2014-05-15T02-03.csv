7747674,comment,7743002,7745045,1,0,nightski,,,"What I am saying is mutability is not something that tends to stay local.  Either you isolate it at the top, ala Haskell or it tends to find it&#x27;s way into everything.<p>SSA is great, except that as you say it is functionally equivalent to immutability.  There is no advantage to it <i>over</i> using immutable data structures.  In fact, it is inferior as it only covers a subset of problems that immutability does.<p>The examples in the blog post illustrate this.  He wants to make local variables mutable because otherwise he can&#x27;t pass a reference to a function which mutates a value.  That mutation is completely unnecessarily and could of been performed with a pure function instead.<p>Note the blog author says: &quot;Think: when was the last time you responded to a compiler error about illegal mutation by doing anything other than restructuring the code to make the mutation legal?&quot;<p>I actually do this all the time.  That is probably the largest challenge coming to a language like Haskell from an imperative background.  Sometimes you can&#x27;t just fix the little mutability problem locally, it has to be redesigned with immutability in mind.",1400122546

7747672,comment,7745736,7745736,2,0,comex,,,"On one hand, developer tools really are a worst case situation for sandboxing, as they are the most closely tied to a rich Unix heritage that happens to have been designed with security only to protect users from each other, not from their own compromised applications.  (I suspect it would work much better if Unix were designed with capabilities in mind from the beginning, though I&#x27;m not sure exactly how such a system would work.)  Plus, sending people compromised source code to build isn&#x27;t exactly a common attack vector - although to be fair, if you think about how often people download random source tarballs and run the shell scripts inside, and the known existence of &quot;watering hole&quot; attacks targeting developers, someone somewhere has probably tried it.  And of course, Apple does not require itself to implement sandboxing in Xcode.<p>On the other hand, sandboxing in general is definitely a good thing - you can&#x27;t constantly bring up the security threat posed by the NSA et al. and then complain about the most effective type of anti-exploitation measure we know of today.  Apple&#x27;s sandbox implementation on OS X is reasonably flexible, and the post itself seems to concede that given more time, Panic could have come up with a reasonable experience that runs under it, perhaps with some features more awkward than without but essentially intact.

No scientific breakthrough or cutting edge device is ever created out of thin air.  Nearly all of them are through combining and expounding upon existing theory and research.  Relativity, for all its brilliance, was an extension of existing thought in theoretical physics at the time that had been coming to a head over the course of centuries prior to that.  It is no coincidence that so many great discoveries and inventions in recent history have ended in a race to the patent office or a highly publicized science drama between great minds.  Often these great thinkers are working on the same things at the same time because those are the subjects the scientific world is chattering about.  Even so, Tesla created a number of things, such as radio control, that were well ahead of his contemporaries and immensely improved upon existing ideas such as Edison&#x27;s DC systems.  He is definitely worth some fair criticism, but not on this basis.<p>As to his business success, I can hardly see how that&#x27;s even relevant.  Few great scientists have also been great entrepreneurs.  I&#x27;ll agree he didn&#x27;t fail solely on the basis of Edison&#x27;s supposed feud with him, but neither does his lack of success at business diminish him as a successful engineer and scientist.",1400121823

But at least in Firefox, that does not work anymore. (More precisely, you cannot scroll down although if you start dragging at the end of the selection, you can scroll up.) In other words, browsers have gotten so complicated that even an organization like Mozilla that spends millions of dollars a year on browser development cannot preserve all of the conveniences users used to enjoy for handling text.<p>My main response, though, is that the browser organizations (Mozilla, Google, MS and Apple) could have balanced the interests of content producers and content consumers instead of their giving content producers (and web-app developers, and marketers) almost everything they want like they have done.  It&#x27;s not as if the New York Times would have withdrawn from the web if the things they could do with code and with stylesheets were more limited.",1400120704

That has nothing to do with whether the US records are correct.<p>I have no idea how Greenwald brought up the issue of Boundless Informant in his book, I just know that I saw slides in his PDF showing the US and Poland (maybe more - I forget).  In that series of articles, they seemed to make pretty clear that the program was showing where the collection came from, not where the targets were.  So, for example, the numbers from Norway represented communications collected &quot;to support Norwegian military operations in conflict areas abroad, or connected to the fight against terrorism, also abroad&quot;.  Same with Germany, France, Spain and Italy (I&#x27;m probably missing some).  When it comes to the US numbers, I don&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s that big of a leap to take the same statement that the Norwegian intelligence service made, and replace all instances of &quot;Norway&quot; with &quot;US&quot;.<p>> That was the Gellman and the Washington post that claimed that, without question. The Guardian article framed it as a question. Greenwald never had to issue any retractions.<p>From the article published in The Guardian[1]:<p><i>The National Security Agency has obtained direct access to the systems of Google, Facebook, Apple and other US internet giants, according to a top secret document obtained by the Guardian.</i><p>...<p><i>With this program, the NSA is able to reach directly into the servers of the participating companies and obtain both stored communications as well as perform real-time collection on targeted users.</i><p>With regards to the provider&#x27;s denials, I don&#x27;t see anything evasive about them:<p>Google: <i>&quot;I&#x27;m not sure what the details of this PRISM program are, but I can tell you that the only way in which Google reveals information about users are when we receive lawful, specific orders about individuals -- things like search warrants. And we continue to stand firm against any attempts to do so broadly or without genuine, individualized suspicion, and publicize the results as much as possible in our Transparency Report. Having seen much of the internals of how we do this, I can tell you that it is a point of pride, both for the company and for many of us, personally, that we stand up to governments that demand people&#x27;s information.&quot;</i> [2]<p>Microsoft: <i>&quot;We provide customer data only when we receive a legally binding order or subpoena to do so, and never on a voluntary basis. In addition we only ever comply with orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers. If the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data we don’t participate in it.&quot;</i> [3]<p>Facebook: <i>&quot;Facebook is not and has never been part of any program to give the US or any other government direct access to our servers. We have never received a blanket request or court order from any government agency asking for information or metadata in bulk, like the one Verizon reportedly received. And if we did, we would fight it aggressively. We hadn&#x27;t even heard of PRISM before yesterday.\nWhen governments ask Facebook for data, we review each request carefully to make sure they always follow the correct processes and all applicable laws, and then only provide the information if is required by law. We will continue fighting aggressively to keep your information safe and secure.&quot;</i>[4]<p>AOL: <i>&quot;We do not have any knowledge of the Prism program. We do not disclose user information to government agencies without a court order, subpoena or formal legal process, nor do we provide any government agency with access to our servers.&quot;</i> [5]<p>Every one of them is very clear: the NSA needs a court order to get user&#x27;s data, and they have only complied with orders for specific users.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://plus.google.com/u/0/+YonatanZunger/posts/huwQsphBron"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/u/0/+YonatanZunger/posts/huwQsphBron</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2013/jun13/06-06statement.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2013/jun13/06-06st...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100828955847631"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100828955847631</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://blog.aol.com/2013/06/07/aol-statement-regarding-nsa-prism/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.aol.com/2013/06/07/aol-statement-regarding-nsa-p...</a><p>EDIT: Fixed formatting",1400120040

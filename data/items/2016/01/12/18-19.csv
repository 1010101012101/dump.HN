I can run this on a $9/month VPS [1] and, at full utilization, handle about 21 million requests per month.<p>Handling the same volume of requests on AWS Lambda is not just more expensive, but <i>hugely</i> more expensive. You end up paying about $4 in request charges, $73 for the &quot;request gateway&quot;, $15 for the computation itself, and $30 for bandwidth. That&#x27;s more than 13 times the cost, and I haven&#x27;t even factored in data storage. You could buy two VPSes for fault-tolerance, hugely over-provision both of them, and you&#x27;d <i>still</i> end up spending less money than Lambda.<p>If your application is lightweight enough that even a single VPS is dramatically more than you need, then yeah, Lambda&#x27;s pricing model could save you some of those last few dollars.

Python 2 had code that tried to do the right thing automagically with str, such as automatic promotion to unicode where it looks like you really meant a string and that is what is needed.  Automatic promotion can fail, be unexpected, is hard to test and numerous other issues.  That is why Python 3 was needed and why it needed to be incompatible.  To have Python 2 and 3 code interoperate in the same interpreter would require another layer of automatic promotion/demotion and heuristics when data goes between the two.<p>C++ was explicitly defined to be a superset of C so it doesn&#x27;t have these kind of issues.  The analogous situation would be if C didn&#x27;t distinguish between long and pointer types, and C++ did.

You&#x27;re pointing at a handful of politically charged decisions that play a vanishingly small role in the performance of the overall economy today. Besides, your statements are inaccurate. The Harper government spent more on municipal public transit than every other federal government in history combined. The Eglinton subway you cite isn&#x27;t even funded by the federal government, it&#x27;s funded by the Ontario government you claim Harper hated. You missed the Scarborough subway which runs entirely through Liberal ridings. Public transportation is a provincial responsibility and the Harper government was the first federal government to invest in it substantially, doling out billions for subways in Vancouver and Toronto and the Toronto government&#x27;s SmartTrack program. I hope you realize the entire existing Toronto subway system was built without federal funding.<p>I don&#x27;t really want to defend the Harper government&#x27;s track record on transportation, because I don&#x27;t think they did enough, but trying to say that Canada lacks economic diversification because Harper didn&#x27;t build enough subways is just ludicrous.<p>Government program spending both in real $ and as a percentage of GDP are higher today than when Harper took office, although they&#x27;ve declined from the peak of the 2008 recession and stimulus program. Direct program expenditure by the federal government was 12.8% of GDP in 2005-06 and 12.9% in 2014-15. Cutting taxes doesn&#x27;t mean cutting spending, if the economy is growing. The biggest cuts to government spending occurred during the 1990s as part of Chretien&#x27;s deficit elimination program. Spending has only now recovered to the level of the mid-90s. This is all shown in Finance Canada&#x27;s fiscal tables. I suggest you examine the numbers yourself rather than relying on newspaper editorials that cherry-pick examples.",1452624182

A landlord will almost always outbid a homeowner when buying a plot of land, because the landlord intends to monetize the land, while the homeowner intends to live on it.<p>A land value tax would favor monetization over personal use, increasing rental prices and expanding the size of the &quot;renter class&quot; while shrinking the size of the &quot;homeowner class&quot;. The result would be an effective increase in the relative price of owning a home compared to renting one.<p>Paying rent is obviously economically inferior to owning property, and any policy that encourages rental growth over homeowner growth will only increase the inequality gap.

Having full control over the actual SQL also means you don&#x27;t risk potentially horribly inefficiently generated SQL, or risk running into unexpected N+1 scenarios. At the same time, you don&#x27;t have to deal with JDBC and instead get a DAO layer that uses strongly typed objects.<p>Of course the disadvantage is that you lose portability; moving for instance a MyBatis/SqlServer app to Oracle will mean verifying, testing and potentially rewriting every single SQL statement in your app. If you&#x27;re willing to accept that risk though, MyBatis is a great lightweight library to manage your database access layer.",1452623350

In many cases, this means it can be more accurate to imprecisely share a thought than to attempt to do so with precision - the imprecise thought doesn&#x27;t paint the whole picture, but it leaves fewer unimportant details (at least in the opinion of the speaker) up for interpretation.<p>This is exactly why the ancient Greeks viewed philosophy and rhetoric as two sides of the same coin.

There are correlations/statistical properties that are exploited in the first case by the encoder and that does not exist in the second case.

In the private market, it&#x27;s usually impossible to short-sell, so private prices may be biased upward relative to what they &quot;would be&quot; in a public market.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how big this effect is, though; just pointing out one reasonable possible source of difference between private and public pricing here.",1452622630

Overwhelmingly in favour of the resource sector.<p>You seem quite married to this simplistic thesis that oil is Canada&#x27;s downfall, but &quot;just look&quot; isn&#x27;t an argument. I looked, and the non-oil economic output continued to grow through the oil boom, just not as fast as the oil and gas sector. Yes, oil was a temporary boost, but the country isn&#x27;t any worse off than if it hadn&#x27;t extracted that oil. By the way, the government does not enforce oil production quotas in Canada. The fact that the world oil price soared above $100USD causing massive production increases in Canada was not an economic policy of the Canadian government. That&#x27;s the market economy functioning, not central planning as you imply. The government didn&#x27;t peg the CAD to world oil prices, the international currency markets did. NOT producing oil in the highest price environment in the history of the world would have been an economic loss for Canada.<p>Furthermore, the last government, like the current one and every Canadian government in living memory, gave billions in handouts to every sector of the economy, especially manufacturing. The federal government spent billions balling out the US automakers in Canada. Yet manufacturing has been declining since the 1990s, long before the current oil boom. Have you seen a chart of labour productivity in Canada vs. the US and Mexico over the last 20 years? We&#x27;re a high-cost low-productivity environment and not just because of a high dollar. Having actual social security programs and higher unionization rates places a big, structural role in failing to attract and retain manufacturing capacity within NAFTA.<p>It&#x27;s puzzling that you think the oil production boom in Canada was caused by the Canadian government when production was booming in every petroleum producing country in the world because of high global demand.

I own hundreds of MP3s legitimately bought from amazon.com without any DRM on them. The existence of these files on my computer are in no way evidence of any infringement. Only if I were to share these files online without first securing the right to do so do I infringe. It is the act, not the file that is illegal.<p>Luckily, they seem to get this distinction in the following statements:<p><i>We argue that if someone sells a CAD file that prints a patented item, that should be considered infringing... But what if someone is not selling the CAD file? Instead, they just possess it. Should that be infringement, too? We think not. The patent system encourages others to design around existing patents, which is often done in a virtual space. If the CAD file itself would be viewed as infringement, then the system could lose such beneficial improvement efforts.</i><p>First a quibble: very few 3D-printing enthusiasts use CAD, they use STL files or GCode (the actual code instructions for the printer). The fact that the author makes no mention of this tells me they haven&#x27;t really taken the time to understand the technology they are critiquing.<p>Secondly, they are painting an incomplete picture here. You are either selling patented 3D files, which should be illegal, or you are working with them personally, which should remain legal in the spirit of promoting innovation. But what about collaboration, which requires sharing these files? 3D Printing Designers often share their designs in order to solicit feedback. What happens if I send my design to a someone on 3DHubs to have them print it for me?<p>Thirdly, how the heck are designers supposed to know what is patented and what isn&#x27;t? Have you ever tried to find prior-work on the US Patent Office web site? Good luck getting the keywords right or sifting through the PDF drawings to see if someone else had your idea. This isn&#x27;t at all like copyright infringement, where you are copying something someone else created.

Not the conditions that created Tran and many like him, but\nthe issue of those who don&#x27;t have home chefs.<p>I&#x27;m not saying clawing back time from the day and isn&#x27;t important and  isn&#x27;t valuable.

10889062,comment,10886271,10886271,0,0,kazinator,,,"Yes; the sheer size of the search space isn&#x27;t what makes the problem hard.<p>Here is an obvious difference:<p>In sorting, we have locally correct solutions in that given any two distinct elements a, b out of the N, we know whether a is to the left or to the right of b in the final order.  Moreover, for a given a, we can find, in linear time, the smallest b which is greater than a: a&#x27;s successor in the sorted order.  Thus sorting is no worse than quadratic. Also, we can examine any permutation of the N items and tell in one pass whether or not it is in sorted order. So <i>recognizing</i> solutions to the sorting problem is linear.<p>Given any two cities, a and b out of N, we do not know which one is visited first in the shortest path, and we certainly don&#x27;t know what a&#x27;s successor will be in the solution. Even verifying a solution to the problem (Is this sequence of cities the shortest path?) cannot be done in polynomial time.<p>So, yes, the mere fact that there are N! orders to search through is by itself unconvincing about the hardness of the problem.<p>Lectures on it would be easy if that were the case: <i>Good morning everyone; today we discuss a class of so-called &quot;NP hard&quot; problems, which occur whenever there is a combinatorial explosion in a search space.</i> :)",1452621721

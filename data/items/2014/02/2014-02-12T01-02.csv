You <i>have</i> to recover() and copy/extract into a function any code that you&#x27;d want to run in the recover.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>    try {\n        ... code that throws\n    } catch {\n    }\n    ... other code\n</code></pre>\nIn Go, to run &quot;other code&quot;, you&#x27;d have to duplicate all of that logic in the recover():<p><pre><code>    defer func() {\n        if err := recover(); err != nil {\n            ... other code (duplicated from below)\n        }\n    }()\n    ... code that panics\n    ... other code\n</code></pre>\nThis isn&#x27;t really the same thing, but I suppose you could <i>technically</i> get the same effect if you move all of &quot;other code&quot; into a function and called that in both places, but you&#x27;re still duplicating code.<p>Panics and exceptions are two very different things, which is why there are different idioms in place to make working with them safe.",1392170281

There&#x27;s a reason we didn&#x27;t give &quot;panic&quot; the name &quot;throw&quot;.

Panics should happen when things go badly wrong, and most of the time that means your program should crash.<p>You should use recover only in two rare cases: 1. where you&#x27;re specifically using panic/recover as a kind of setjmp/longjmp  (as it is used within encoding/json, for example), and 2. where you don&#x27;t want a programming error to bring down your entire program, such as in the base net/http handler (although I think it&#x27;s debatable whether we should have done it there; but it&#x27;s done now and we can&#x27;t change it).<p>It amazes me that there has been so much discussion over this incredibly minor and seldom-used feature.

The makefile language is simple yet extremely powerful for describing a dependency tree such as that for building an executable from sources. Its perhaps strongest point is that it completely agnostic to what the different steps actually do rather than consist of a predefined set of canned rules/tasks with, if you&#x27;re lucky, a convoluted way of adding your own using e.g. python (or worse, java).  This means that as long as a shell command can turn a set of inputs into an output, describing it takes (usually) just two lines of makefile, one naming the target and prerequisites, one providing the command to perform the transformation.  If a particular rule is too complicated for a few shell commands, invoking a separate script (or even a just-built executable) is trivial.  Every other system I&#x27;ve looked at needed a comparatively enormous amount of code for adding even the slightest tweak to the built-in rules.<p>GNU make is actually two different languages coexisting in the same file (the makefile), a declarative language for describing the targets and their dependencies as well as a functional language for the variables/macros.

In my case my experience is about having the attribute of high intelligence.<p>If this was a discussion about being tall instead of being intelligent, and I happened to be very tall, would it change your opinion if my deduction had been that tall people can dunk basketballs more easily than short people and then relayed an experience where I, though I don&#x27;t play basketball, demonstrated this to a short fanatical basketball fanatic by dunking a ball?<p>It doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m always right, or that my deductions are always correct. I&#x27;m not omniscient. In that anecdote it turns out I was, and it was destructive to my relationship.<p>Being highly intelligent is like walking around with a bomb in your head. You have to be very careful how you approach other people because your mere existence is hard for them to accept. It&#x27;s not a good feeling to hurt or scare people by doing what you were born to do.<p>Just being tall, and doing tall people things, like grabbing something off of a high shelf, is not likely to elicit the same response.<p>You have to constantly translate the complex interconnected mental world you swim in into a simpler model you can communicate with. When I meet another high-intelligence person, I don&#x27;t have to do that beyond establishing a common vocabulary. It&#x27;s a fun thrill to have a conversation with somebody who&#x27;s mind races along like yours, just like it&#x27;s fun for a tall person to be around other tall people.<p>One of the issues with being highly intelligent is that you&#x27;re right more than most people, which makes it difficult to trust the input of more normal folks. So you end up trusting yourself all the time, which means that when you are wrong, you don&#x27;t know or recognize it until it explodes spectacularly in your face.",1392166922

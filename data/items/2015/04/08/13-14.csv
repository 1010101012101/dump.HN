I&#x27;d guess that new things are as likely to pique my interest whether or not I&#x27;m medicated.<p>The difference is that medication makes it easier for me to decide on a scope for my current activities and makes it so that a conscious decision is <i>required</i> in order to react to a stimulus or tangent which would take me out of that intended scope.

9340712,comment,9337863,9337863,0,0,mpdehaan2,,,"There&#x27;s a somewhat famous quote from photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson — &#x27;Your first 10000 photographs are your worst.&#x27; In that vein, everything you do can get better.<p>25 is not old.  The industry is somewhat young-people-worshipping now, but that&#x27;s because computation has gotten incredibly popular now, and that is the age of a lot of people - most of the people I&#x27;ve worked with are older than that, and that&#x27;s fine.  Experience is great.  There will be a ton of older folks making awesome things long into the distant future. I find the idea (it seems a little bay-area centric) that 25 is old to be, well, insane, but perhaps that&#x27;s just what people of every generation do.<p>I started my first startup at 33 or so, really, there&#x27;s nothing magically about this (many parts of it totally suck!), and it&#x27;s just as good to work for a large company.  Because someone started something at an earlier age is really meaningless.  Heck, just thinking about a great idea for 5 years and then finally making it into a thing is valuable, so your time isn&#x27;t wasted.  We are basically a culmination of all of our experiences, and how we use that information.  More experience is better.<p>The best thing you can do is build cool things that you enjoy, but there&#x27;s also no point in trying to &quot;win&quot; the game or be better than anyone else.<p>I think the general ideas about attachment or desire for greater things breeding suffering are more or less correct.  Build things that you enjoy, and enjoy them for you. It&#x27;s similar to &quot;more money, more problems&quot;. Fame from past projects or accomplishments will fade too, technology gets replaced daily. You can be happy with today, but if you are always focusing on tomorrow, you really can&#x27;t be.  Also, if you don&#x27;t enjoy building things, do something you do enjoy as well.  Helping people matters.  Everything else?  Building a really shiny ecommerce webpage?  Not so much.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is, those things don&#x27;t matter.  There&#x27;s no benchmark.  There&#x27;s only whether you are happy, and you can actually change what makes you happy.  And it&#x27;s also ok if you don&#x27;t know what that is yet.<p>But yeah, if you want to do good stuff, keep doing more stuff.  Better just happens.  (And to bring it back to the quote -- everybody takes bad photos, the trick is to just not upload the bad ones.  Everybody writes bad code too!).<p>Ultimately I think HN focuses on people who get lucky and make the big bugs on startup exits or big CEO salaries WAAAY too much. It messes up people&#x27;s value systems. Money is not all that matters - not by a longshot.  It&#x27;s also true you can do really well without being one of those extremely lucky people.",1428500841

Common wisdom says that since Infiniband is a niche technology, it&#x27;s hugely expensive, but strangely(?) it seems to have (MUCH!) better bang per buck than ethernet. A 36-port FDR IB (56 Gb/s) switch has a list price of around $10k, whereas a quick search seems to suggest a 48-port 10GbE switch has a list price of around $15k. So the per-port price is roughly in the same ballpark, but IB gives you >5 times better bandwidth and 2 orders of magnitude lower MPI latency. Another advantage is that IB supports multipathing, so you can build high bisection bandwidth networks (all the way to fully non-blocking) without needing $$$ uber-switches on the spine.",1428500703

Stop it! ;)<p>I&#x27;ve heard it explained that the scrum thing was a way to start the journey. If you are in developer chaos, or utterly bogged down in useless process (some processes are good), then this will get you on the road. But we have better tools these days. Use them. Remember what your goals are. Scrum is not the goal. Delivering/testing the product or feature is (for example). If scrum is a strategy that gets you there in a better way, great. If you have a better way, use that instead.<p>Two week sprints are probably better than 3 year development cycles for most things (airplanes and nuclear reactors require a lot of planning, sorry). But it is artificial. Any complex project will have many different components, and all of them are going to have a different, natural cadence. This core infrastructure requires careful planning and build out. That UI element needs to be slapped together for an A/B test. This &quot;like&quot; fits great into the next 2 weeks. This device driver has to be syncronized with the prototype hardware delivery being made by your partner. And so on. Almost none of that fits into a &#x27;finished product every two weeks, never stop or change once you start&quot;.<p>If scrum works for you, great, but please don&#x27;t cargo cult it, or think it is the end instead of the beginning.<p>Useless but fun anecdote: I was reading some glassdoor reviews yesterday if a nearby compay.

9340645,comment,9339803,9340508,0,0,VLM,,,"&quot;don&#x27;t rely so completely on interviews/high pressure social situations seems laudable to me&quot;<p>There is an obvious competitive advantage to any company that removes arbitrary and unnecessary barriers, aside from whats being discussed.  If almost no jobs actually require that arbitrary barrier, the pool of applicants on the other side of the barrier will inherently have individuals better at the job than the pool who made it over the artificial meaningless barrier.  Given a big pond, a small random sample of pond water will always have a smaller &quot;biggest fish&quot; than a larger random sample from the same pond, and if the sample size expands to the size of the whole pond, that fisherman will get the biggest possible fish.<p>The fact that this doesn&#x27;t happen historically or currently despite the obvious financial advantage, shows that hiring and general office culture is obviously more influenced by primate dominance rituals than economic reasons.  When you throw in some additional dominance rituals to compensate or rationalize away the reduced hazing rituals and membership rituals to &quot;even things up&quot;, its going to be a hellish working environment for the folks who do get in.<p>Mix the above paragraph with the observation of corporate communication always indicates the opposite of what it explicitly claims.  So a company that feels the need to say quality is job one actually prioritizes quality dead last after production goals and profit and pretty much everything else.  Or a company that issues elaborate press releases about its diversity program invariably actually closes management ranks to all but old white men.  You can handle an issue by &quot;doing things&quot; or you can dispose of it by &quot;issue human interest press releases&quot; so press releases mean it was decided nothing will actually be done.  So you can assume a corporate communication of opening hiring to autistic people actually means it was completely and utterly closed to them and it&#x27;ll remain that way but we&#x27;ll talk nicely about it and issue press releases for the human interest spin on the news.  We won&#x27;t hire them but we&#x27;ll talk really nicely about them instead.<p>So its kind of a &quot;one step forward two steps back&quot; story.  Its actually signalling that autistic people would be better off working anywhere else.  Which is a useful observation.  And fitting in with the first paragraph, it means MS competitors have an inherent advantage over MS in having superior hiring policies instead of the MS strategy of instead talking about superior hiring policies.",1428500229

I wanted to be a Journalist, but I didn&#x27;t score high enough on the ASVAB apparently and got stuck with an Audio/Video job.  I was far from a Valedictorian, I scraped by with Bs and Cs.  Fast forward years later, having worked many other jobs from factories/warehouses to gas stations; I grew weary and went to college.  I was 27.  How did you think I felt after little to no career success?  I switched Majors three times.  Started with the intention of doing Physical Therapy, switched to Pre-Pharmacy, then Biochemistry - struggled immensely, and finally went CS, sort of.  I picked a CIS degree because it would have been another year of college to do the CS (the math would have added much of that).<p>I graduated at 31.

Popular culture isn&#x27;t mature enough that we all feel we should treat people well by default - we are happy to abuse autistic spectrum people because they&#x27;re not clearly labelled as being a member of a disadvantaged group. We know we shouldn&#x27;t abuse people for being black, handicapped, gay, female, etc. But we can still abuse people who don&#x27;t &quot;understand the unwritten rules of the workplace&quot;. So at least this may benefit people who can be labelled as autistic to get protection from that abuse and discrimination. That&#x27;s going to happen at a job interview, where an otherwise qualified candidate can be discriminated against because they wouldn&#x27;t be a &quot;good fit for our team&quot;. Members of many other disadvantaged groups already get some protection from this - you can&#x27;t refuse to hire someone because they&#x27;re a woman and thus wouldn&#x27;t be a good fit for your all-male team, but you can refuse someone for being unable to understand complex social interactions even when they aren&#x27;t essential for performing the job.<p>It&#x27;s not ideal however. Ideally we wouldn&#x27;t ostracize someone for misunderstanding jokes, trying unsuccessfully to mimic the likable behavior of neurotypicals or failing to make eye contact at the right moments. But our society is still at that level of intolerance where we need some kind of labeling of disadvantaged people to help everyone else stop and think &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m not supposed to be mean to him for that, he can&#x27;t help it&quot;.",1428500035

This was done so that the borders wouldn&#x27;t move in/out while scrolling.<p>By turning this option on/off precisely timed, the VIC graphics chip never found itself at the &quot;correct&quot; location to enable the borders, and so never did.<p>Opening the top/bottom borders was done very early because it didn&#x27;t require much timing.<p>Opening the left/right borders with static sprites happened soon afterwards.<p>Opening the left/right borders with moving sprites was particularly nasty because the VIC &quot;stole&quot; extra bus cycles from the CPU for each sprite present on a given scan line, so if you wanted to move sprites in the Y position and open the borders, you needed to adjust your timing by the correct number of cycles for each scan line, often done by jumping into a sequence of NOP&#x27;s.

The problem, as you allude to, is that classically unit numbers were assigned by the programmer rather than the OS or runtime library, so you could end up with clashes e.g. if you used two libraries which both wanted to do I/O on, say, unit=10. Modern Fortran has a solution to this, though, in the NEWUNIT= specifier, where the runtime library assigns a unique unit number.<p>> As far as I can tell there is no functionality that approximates the behaviour of C++&#x27;s streams.<p>As of Fortran 2003, there is ACCESS=&quot;stream&quot;, which is a record-less file similar to what common operating systems and programming languages nowadays provide.<p>> It&#x27;s fast as hell, and the GNU compiler is mature and well-developed, but Fortran remains a horrid language for doing any sort of interactive programming.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m hoping for Julia to succeed, but we&#x27;ll see..",1428499394

In other words, a brand new book release would not have been available on the $9.95 subscription service on the first day.  This is similar to Amazon Prime Instant Video where the old seasons of TV shows are free but the latest/last/current season costs $$$.  Spotify for music also works like that for some artists;  Adele has her old songs available in the subscription but her brand new song might only be available from iTunes for $1.29.<p>It looks like a common industry pattern of segmentation whether it&#x27;s books, videos, or songs:  the old stuff can be packaged into cheap subscriptions but the new stuff will command a separate premium.<p>With Oyster adding the ebook retail component, members can get access to the very latest books without waiting months (or years) for the title to show up as a subscription option.  The members simply buy the ebook as a separate additional charge from the $9.95 subscription.<p>Since Jeff Bezos’ seems to have a very antagonistic relationship with the book publishers, it gives Oyster a chance for significant ebook sales.<p>What’s odd is that Jeff Bezos studied Walmart and he surely knows that the brick&morter stores share analytics sales data with their vendors.  That way, the vendors can maximize efficiency of their supply chains and in turn, offer lower prices to Walmart.  The article implies that amazon.com does not share analytics with the publishers (unlike Oyster) .  I don’t know why Bezos would be so guarded about it since it can help publishers fine tune their offerings which in turn should help Jeff sell more ebooks and Kindle devices.  Maybe he thinks he needs that proprietary data as a comparative advantage for his own publishing house[1].  However, it seems unrealistic to think many major authors would jump to Amazon Publishing because amazon has better analytics.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Publishing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Publishing</a>",1428498249

I was smart enough that I coasted through high school, but when I hit college I very nearly flunked out.<p>The problem was that my interests ran hot and cold. One day/minute/hour I&#x27;d be deeply interested in some subject, and the next I couldn&#x27;t care less. This would happen with topics which I knew were captivating to me in a general sense. Sometimes I&#x27;d get so interested in some project I&#x27;d skip other classes for a week or more because I couldn&#x27;t stop thinking about it.<p>However most of the time I&#x27;d find that without exercising hurculean amounts of discipline there was no way I was going to be able to stay on track well enough to study and finish homework/projects.<p>I&#x27;d sit down for a lecture with all kinds of ambition to focus and absorb the material. 20 minutes in my brain was somewhere else and the margins of my notebook were filled with mindless doodles.<p>When my grades dropped low enough my school&#x27;s intervention programs kicked in.

4044559,comment,4044044,4044494,3,0,speric,,,"I just meant, if you have a spouse, then you need their support.  If you don't have a spouse, I think you can still pull it off, but as I have never done a startup under those circumstances, any advice I'd give would be purely speculative.  Practically speaking, you'd still have nights and weekends to work on your startup.<p>Are you doing a startup with a cofounder?  I'd be worried, from an emotional standpoint, about doing a startup under those conditions without any moral support (from either a spouse or cofounder).  Everyone is different but the dark secret of startup life (especially bootstrapped on the side) is that it's tough, and you can get depressed easily for a number of reasons.  Having someone in the trenches with you is a great help, emotionally.",1338407962

Well, as promising the results are, they no doubt are surprising to some. In 2009 Prochymal suffered a major setback as two separate trials showed that, while the drug was safe, it failed to improve the condition of patients with graft-versus-host disease.</i> This treatment was shown twice to be ineffective, and therefore not worth the risk of injecting yourself with an experimental batch of processed stem cells. Also, <i>even with the failed 2009 trials, the FDA isnt dragging its feet. Prochymal is currently being tested in trials that will assess, not only its ability to mitigate graft-versus-host disease, but Crohns Disease as well.</i>",1338407911

4044544,comment,4043436,4044456,1,0,paperwork,,,"I think the current confusion is due to the fact that relational databases are too often thought of as data stores. It is true that these DBs are not always the best solution. Sometimes it is better to store data in various NoSQL databases. Sometimes it is even better to store data in a flat file.<p>However, relational databases provide unprecedented ability to query information. Imagine one person puts data into a black box. 100 other people can ask it questions which were never intended by the original designer, and the system is able to answer those questions fairly efficiently.<p>The language used to query is orders of magnitude simpler than 'normal' programming languages.<p>If you query your database and the answer takes too long, you can add an index and the exact same query will start running more quickly!<p>Two different people can create two different tables. A third person can come in and 'join' these two tables.<p>I see nosql being a low level technology, higher than blocks/files/b-trees but lower than relational databases. Another way to say it is that relational algebra is the theoretical model while large parts of modern nosql tools are implementation details.",1338407817

Those are not business models. They are just ways that money travels. It's like saying one's business model is accepting checks.<p>I came here to post this.  Kickstarter's intent is to assist with bootstrapping a product.  It's not monetization.  It's a way to get the capital to produce something.  They answer the question ""It's going to cost $100,000 to make a batch of our widgets/books/etc.  Is there enough of a market to actually sell that number?""<p>Stripe, Amazon Payments, Google Checkout, etc. are payment processors.  Again, they're not monetization.  They're there to get money from customers hands into your hands.  They're the answer to ""We want to sell this, how can we get our customer's money?""<p>But even if you're using those methods to provide answers to those questions, the fundamental question still remains: ""What are you selling, and how do you sell it?""<p>THAT is where the business model comes in.  If you cannot answer that question, I seriously question your entire startup.",1338406376

4044422,comment,4043454,4043819,6,0,ChuckMcM,,,"So for reference, when I left Sun in '95 I joined a startup named 'Golfweb' as their 'technology' guy. Golfweb was an online magazine about Golf, entirely digital, no print. They had partnered with Golf Digest (print only) because GD didn't know if this 'Internet thing' was a fad or not. Personally I think our agreement was with some nerdy kid in the mailroom but I digress.<p>Anyway, we tried to sell companies like Ping Golf on banner ads. These guys were paying $10K - $40K per color page in Golf Digest so maybe $250K an issue and we were asking them to pay us $40K to have all the ads on our web site during the Masters Tournament. It was a hard sell even though at the time <i>we were one of exactly two professional sites covering golf on the Internet.</i><p>The challenge wasn't that Ping didn't understand advertising, what they didn't know yet was how effective it would be. They measured everything and without data they didn't know if it was more or less valuable than print. Because of that they were unwilling to spend any money.<p>As it turned out that campaign was pretty wildly successful for them. Because of it they were way ahead of their competitors in exploiting the Internet for ads. Once they were in, their competitors followed, and that created a market model for costing golf advertising.<p>So this is the same issue with mobility monetization today. Since there isn't a huge amount of experience out there it is not easy to justify spending a lot on it vs web moneitization which is by now a 'proven' channel. But over time the data will come in and people will then be able to make reasoned choices about what they are willing to pay to be on some potential customer's phone at some given time.<p>In her presentation, Meeks proposed that mobile monetization should at least equal web monetization and probably exceed it. I've seen other people get there by reasoning about how people use their phone to find nearby places that can service some immediate need like food, car service, gas, Etc. As a contrived, but plausible, example consider a world with multiple Uber type livery services, and a user finds a nearby place on their phone's map application. You can sell the rights to a button that says ""Pick me up here and take me there."" to a company like Uber very effectively. As an 'advertisement' that is worth probably $1 - $3 a click depending on what the fare is going to be if its taken.<p>Now is that exactly an ad? I don't know. It is a convenient pairing of service provider offering at a probabilistically determined 'good' time to offer. That any individual doesn't click on the offer is fine, as long as some percentage (even a small percent) do.",1338406300

Any pricing scheme creates incentives. You get customers' money when the benefits outweigh the price. Per-project pricing makes it easy to get your product in front of as many eyes as can benefit from it, which can create internal network effects that boost internal adoption, which in turn leads to more use. Per-user pricing does not have similar network effects, because you associate a cost directly with adding people to the network.<p>(Which doesn't mean that per-user pricing has no place ever--that's <i>absolutely not</i> my point--just that it's not something that always makes sense.)<p>Second, tiered pricing:
It absolutely makes sense that your customers like per-user pricing: <i>they've already self-selected to use your product, which has per-user pricing</i>. The people who don't want per-user pricing are probably just going to ignore your product in the first place, and you'll never know they exist. Tiered pricing is preferred by a certain class of customers. Some of the reasons for that are listed in my initial post. It's unsurprising that it's not preferred by other classes of customers.<p>Again, I am <i>not</i> arguing that tiered pricing is a universal good or anything similarly silly.

For the more complicated ones, A/B testing does face that issue and I know how to work around it.  With a bandit approach I'm not sure I'd have noticed the issue.<p><i>was it suggested that you must ""set it and forget it""?</i><p>Not ""must"", but it was highly recommended.  See paragraph 4 of <a href=""http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=132"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=132</a> - look for the words in bold.<p><i>are there no mechanisms for mitigating these issues?</i><p>There are mechanisms for mitigating some of these issues.  The blog does not address those.  As soon as you go into them, you get more complicated.  It stops being the ""20 lines that always beats A/B testing"" that the blog promised.<p>I was doing some back of the envelopes on different methods of mitigating these problems.  What I found was that in the best case you turn into<p><i>would using 20% or 30% mitigate the issues?</i><p>That would lessen the issue that I gave, at the cost of permanently worse performance.<p>The permanent performance bit can benefit from an example.  Suppose that there is a real 5% improvement.  The blog's suggested approach would permanently assign 5% of traffic to the worse version, for 0.25% less improvement than you found.<p>Now suppose you tried a dozen things.  1/3 of them were 5% better, 1/3 were 5% worse, and 1/3 did not matter.  The 10% bandit approach causes you to lose 0.25% conversion for each test with a difference, for a permanent roughly 2% drop in your conversion rate over actually making your decisions.<p>(Note, this is not a problem with all bandit strategies.  There are known optimal approaches where the total testing penalty decreases over time.  If the assumptions of a k-armed bandit hold, the average returns of the epsilon strategy will lose to A/B test then go with the winner, which in turn loses to more sophisticated bandit approaches.  The question of interest is whether the assumptions of the bandit strategy really hold.)<p>Whichever form of testing you use, you're doing better than not testing.  Most of the benefit just comes from actually doing testing.  But the A/B testing approach here is not better by hundredths of a percent, it is about a permanent 2% margin.  That's not insignificant to a business.<p>If you move from 10% to 20%, that permanent penalty doubles.  You're trading off certain types of short-term errors for long-term errors.<p>(Again, this is just an artifact of the fact that an epsilon strategy is far from an optimal solution to the bandit problem.)<p><i>are you not allowed to follow the data closely with the bandit approach?</i><p>I am not sure what you mean here.",1338405214

Partitions are rare; why sacrifice consistency or availability for them in the general case?<p>Thus consider a system with a ""partition mode"" that either limits operations to preserve consistency, or allows operations that risk consistency, depending on what the application needs.<p>This is approach taken with some of the newer NoSQL databases like Cassandra, which tends to prefer availability over consistency, though this is adjustable to prefer consistency in some cases; or the newer distributed RDBMS' like Google F1, which tends to prefer consistency over availability, but generally remains highly available across data centres:  <a href=""http://research.google.com/pubs/pub38125.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.google.com/pubs/pub38125.html</a><p>2.  CAP isn't a single choice for a system. Systems are composed of many sub-systems that often make a different CAP choice, depending on the operation or data or user involved.<p>3.  The properties of partition-tolerance, availability and consistency are more continuous rather than binary.<p>Availability can be measured percentage-wise, whereas consistency isn't as easily measured but can have many different forms, some weaker or stronger.  Partition tolerance can also take on many forms, such as tolerating certain common partitions, but not other (perhaps low probability) ones.<p>Reflecting on the last two points, consider that a system might have:<p>- an offline mode its for HTML or mobile client applications, which enables availability over consistency when certain Internet WAN failures occur,<p>- uses a traditional RDBMS in the server, preferring consistency over availability when partitions occur in the data centre<p>- has a backup RDBMS in a second data centre, which uses asynchronous log shipping replication to preserve availability when partitions occur between data centres (with a chance of data loss),  but also preserves both consistency and availability when partitions occur between the Internet and the primary data centre (but not the secondary).<p>These are all nuanced choices that are very common.   One could replace the above RDBMS with a wide-area Riak Enterprise cluster or Cassandra cluster.   The tradeoffs would be different - say,  no data loss, but the application would  have to be much more explicit about how to deal with inconsistencies when recovering from a partition between the two data centres.<p>Overall, it's good that we have new, more scalable & available data management options beyond the ""all consistency all the time"" traditional RDBMS.   But the solution differs based on the application and level of scalability required.   One shouldn't just throw out consistency because it seems like the new way of doing things.   Similarly, one shouldn't throw out availability just because you're afraid of data loss or inconsistency.   It depends on your problem.",1338405008

- who should work for big tech companies(facebook,google,amazon etc)?
- who should go after his ideas as an entrepreneur?
- who should go for masters degree?<p>For my case : 
I will graduate in June and I am not sure what to do next. Here are my  options :<p>- apply for big tech companies : I will have an interview with google on July but I tried my luck with others(Microsoft, Google, Spotify) and though I made it to final levels for some, I could not make it. I am not sure I am the right fit for these companies. I worked on interviews so much and I feel tired and lost my faith. During one  interview,a guy from Facebook told me that ""if you were an actor you would come to Holywood, as a coder you should come to Silicon Valley"" what do you think?<p>- Go after my ideas : like everyone, I have some ideas and a plus I have skills to build them. But in Turkey, it is really hard to get funding if you are not doing e-commerce. On the other hand I need to earn money.<p>- begin to masters degree in computer science: I am interested in NLP and there is a lot to do with Turkish.<p>thanks for reading, hope you have something to say!",1338404976

I'm assuming your goal is to leverage the success of your startup so that you can leave your day job?  If so, how do you keep focused on your day job, when the excitement of your startup keeps pulling more at you, especially if you are as you start to see success?  I'm in a day job that I hate (its soul crushing), but that gives me the flexibility to work on my startup.

7841744,comment,7841080,7841080,9,0,Arjuna,,,"What I find fascinating, in general, is Apple&#x27;s rise as a gaming powerhouse.<p>Take SpriteKit. It didn&#x27;t exist until it was announced at WWDC 2013. Up until that point, the functionality offered by it was largely either hand-rolled by the developer, or achieved via framework (e.g., Cocos2D). I think Apple realized that they could capture more mind-share and confidence if they offered their own first-party framework offering.<p>Fast-forward a year later, and we have an enhanced SpriteKit (i.e., light sources, field forces, per-pixel physics, inverse kinematics), and of course the newly-announced SceneKit (3D scene rendering for casual games), Swift and Metal... <i>all within a year!</i><p>With regard to Metal, Tim Sweeney had this to say after the Zen Garden app demo:<p>&quot;There are thousands of objects being rendered here in a scene that we couldn&#x27;t have dreamed of building, prior to Metal delivering a 10 fold increase in rendering efficiency. To have this level of graphics capability on iPhone and on iPad now is a stunning breakthrough. We&#x27;re proud to have been a part of it. Of course, we&#x27;d love to share this with you, so as soon as iOS 8 is available, we&#x27;ll be making Zen Garden available in the App Store for free.&quot;",1401818280

The A -> C-v1 and A -> B -> C-v1.1 problem would look like this:<p><pre><code>    (your code)\n    node_modules/\n      A/\n        (code for A)\n        node_modules/\n          C/\n            (code for C at v1)\n          B/\n            (code for B)\n            node_modules/\n              C/\n                (code for C at v1.1)\n</code></pre>\nThe whole tree is created painlessly when you enter `npm install A`. The program figures out the dependencies through JSON files bundled with each module. They include version requirements; npm simply chooses the highest version that respects those requirements. Within each directory, `require(&#x27;C&#x27;)` looks for `./node_modules/C/` and finds the module it actually needs. All versions of all modules are kept at all times on a central public server at <a href=""http://npmjs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://npmjs.org/</a>.<p>This design is only possible in some languages. Dart, for instance, cannot apply that to its libraries because its types are globally defined and would therefore clash.<p>In Go, types are not global, which means this design can apply in principle, according to the Go Spec. However, the implemented import syntax does not act in a way that would make this possible. Oddly enough, that syntax is not specified in the Go Spec:<p>> <i>The interpretation of the ImportPath is implementation-dependent but it is typically a substring of the full file name of the compiled package and may be relative to a repository of installed packages.</i>",1401818276

(My router at home already gives me a &#x27;guest&#x27; wifi with restricted access.)<p>And no, by adding new stuff I don&#x27;t mean a new standard.<p>It&#x27;s called an addendum.\nWhich, I&#x27;m surprised I overlooked, some were made especially to address the security issues: <a href=""http://www.bacnet.org/Addenda/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bacnet.org/Addenda/</a><p>If security really is a big issue, the LAST thing I want is give access to the secured network to my PHONE. Is your phone secure? Would you store your bitcoins on it?<p><i>The reason that home users have ethernet and IP is because of the hourglass model. The reason that most services just work is that they talk TCP/UDP - anything below that they can ignore - so if we use a new hardware layer, if we use FDDI etc we can still use TCP because everything talks in IP. BACnet kinda breaks that - you mentioned ZigBee adding BACnet support - ZigBee has supported IP for ages - had BACnet followed the hourglass model (as literally every other internet service I have ever seen has done) then support for BACnet would have been immediate and unnecessary to trumpet.</i><p>And by supporting IP, it was also (indirectly) supporting BACnet. You just explained how services using TCP/UDP could ignore everything below... I don&#x27;t understand why you don&#x27;t understand it&#x27;s the same thing for BACnet. Those &#x27;official&#x27; transport layers offer you alternatives. But guess what, by supporting Ethernet and IP, BACnet can already use pretty much all the network architecture around..<p><i>BACnet doesn&#x27;t quite fit into that, mostly because it replaces IP for (as I understand it) no particularly good reason.</i>\nOk, this might be the source of the confusion. Yes, the BACnet network layer needed to be defined, because at the time IP wasn&#x27;t everywhere like it is today. <i></i>BUT<i></i>, you can easily embed this into other protocols. That&#x27;s exactly how you talk about your hourglass model: BACnet devices don&#x27;t care if they are connected by MS/TP, Ethernet, IP, Arcnet... They just look at the BACnet level. Just like many services look at the TCP level, not at the IP or Ethernet level.<p>About IPv6 for new networks, if they become required, I see no real obstacle into extending the standard for IPv6. IPv6 is itself an example of a standard changing with time. Would you prefer to throw away IP a start from scratch because IPv4 devices might not be able to communicate with IPv6?<p><i>You want standards when you have a mature market and you want to prevent lockin. Standards in an emerging market can lead to stagnation and reduced innovation(...)</i><p>But why do you consider the consumer domain to be an emerging market?

Growing up in China, I first learned about this on Wikipedia back in the days when it was not blocked. I was furious about it back then. The fact that I had to learn this from Wikipedia for the first time just made it even worse. I tried a lot to collect more information about this. Most of the stuff I found was pointing fingers at the government and military. Being young and naive, I full-heartedly trust every single piece of it.<p>Now I live in Canada and have stayed outside of the Chinese censorship for almost 6 years now. My opinion have changed quite a lot. I used to believe the idea of communism brainwashing, but now I have a feeling that this sort of brainwashing and censorship goes both ways. Remember the famous tank man? It&#x27;s one of the important icon of this event and was marked as a symbol of the Chinese government&#x27;s oppression and brutality. That image/video was widely spread in the western medias. The majority of the public believe he was rolled over by the tank, because you know, Chinese government are evil. The full video was posted earlier on Reddit. Many was shocked to find out that the tank tried to drive around him and eventually stopped until the tank man was pulled away by someone else. Why the mainstream media never showed the full video to the public? Because it contradicted with the brutal image of Chinese government/military that they were trying to portrait to the public. Propaganda is a funny thing. Bearing stereotype and ignorance, both side will hold a strong belief that they are right.<p>I am by no means saying Chinese government is innocent. They pretty evil imo. I am just trying to say is that it is very hard to figure out what really happened now that both sides are extremely biased and ignorant towards the other end. I personally believe there were students killed and injured during the military intervention, but I am strongly skeptical against the massacre claim as there was no solid evidence so far.

The difficulty of programming for iOS (or any platform) is partly the language syntax and partly the library/frameworks. I think Swift will help greatly with the language, but there is still a lot to learn as far as the UI kit and such. Swift doesn&#x27;t really change the fundamental way the libraries work - the syntax is just cleaner (as a matter of opinion, I suppose).<p>In addition to looking a lot more familiar and certain functions being much more readable, apparently using Swift will be safer in regards to memory issues too, which is comforting for people like me who are not guru-level with managing memory.

What I have identified as the problem since I started running DevCongress [1] with a couple of friends and the general community of programmers in Ghana is, ironically, community and activity.<p>You see, Ghanaians generally a quiet people, and it pierces all our circles. It&#x27;s hard to shake that dumb silence off, it&#x27;s hard. Just look at participation in our Google group [3] and how it&#x27;s dominated by just me. That&#x27;s not what we wanted, obviously. So we set out solve the problem of programmers restricting themselves to absolute silence. That familiarity among ourselves would lessen the barrier to participation was our riskiest assumption. So we started yet another project, namely, #eXchange (you can see episodes here [4]). So far we are engaging really well via the videos, and more importantly we&#x27;re exposing the humans (and their humanness) behind the big names in the programmer community in Ghana. It&#x27;s been successful so far.<p>Last but not least of our attempts is FORGE [5]. Oh I so love FORGE! We have plans to launch before the end of June but funds (we foot all the bills ourselves) are holding us back a little. We are preparing to approach GitHub Community [6] to ask for help. Since you&#x27;re in Ghana we should link up to discover even more ways that we can pull ourselves up to an appreciable, non-mediocre level.<p>To all non-African programmers, please consider actively mentoring us even though we can&#x27;t afford to pay you. Also think about offering us internship and job opportunities without paying significant attention to our CVs because tbh, they&#x27;re mostly crap.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.developersinafrica.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.developersinafrica.com</a>  \n[2] <a href=""http://devcongress.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://devcongress.com</a>  \n[3] <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/devcongress"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/devcongress</a>  \n[4] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJdep9xo0Y8UTvKehbhey2g"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJdep9xo0Y8UTvKehbhey2g</a>  \n[5] <a href=""http://forge.devcongress.com/faq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forge.devcongress.com/faq</a>  \n[6] <a href=""https://community.github.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://community.github.com/</a>",1401816243

I&#x27;m very mindful of the difference between doing something vs. doing that thing correctly, and even when I write a piece of code that works, I often stop and ask myself, &quot;OK, but is this the best way to do it?&quot; I try to avoid dirty hacks, and if I&#x27;m on a time crunch where I don&#x27;t have time to figure out the right way, I postpone the feature to the next release rather than putting in a temporary dirty implementation.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve been having trouble with as my project gets more complex is when to refactor. I guess I&#x27;m not yet at the stage where I can accurately judge the benefits of refactoring a code vs. the cost. To use an analogy, am I just re-arranging the furniture to change the look-and-feel of the room (superficial), or am I actually making it easier for the guests to make themselves comfortable (real benefit)? I&#x27;ve read books like Pragmatic Programming [1] that advise refactoring whenever possible to avoid technical debt build-up. But it seems to be that there are times when working on a new feature would result in more value-add for the project as a whole.<p>Another thing is motivating myself to write test cases. The Hartl tutorial taught TDD, but when I started my project from scratch I quickly realized that TDD would slow down my progress significantly, and I didn&#x27;t yet have enough experience to assess how a feature <i>should</i> work to be able to write tests for it. This did bite me in the ass just last night though, as I spent three hours troubleshooting a bug that a test case would have caught. Oh well, live and learn, right? :)",1401815551

It boils down to the idea that whether there is a god or not, you may as well believe because if it turns out that if there is a god you win infinite reward, and if there&#x27;s not then what&#x27;s the loss?<p>However it presupposes that the Christian ideal of a god holds true, one that will reward you for belief and not reward you (or punish you for disbelief). There is a multidimensional spectrum of other options available. What if there is a god but (s)he created a mechanistic universe deliberately left behind no evidence, and so rewards those that use their critical thinking and form no belief? What if there&#x27;s a benevolent god that rewards everyone regardless? What if you picked the wrong god and the real one hates wrong-believers more than atheists?<p>So it really only works in a situation where you have a binary choice, and that doesn&#x27;t model the reality. In other words it&#x27;s an exercise in apologetics written by someone who had already decided to believe, based on other criteria (or no criteria), trying to persuade others through a pseudo-rational argument.<p>I don&#x27;t mean any of this as an attack on you, or as justification to look down on others&#x27; beliefs, but Pascal&#x27;s Wager kinda grinds my gears :)",1401815388

The current situation with OpenGL is far from ideal, but it&#x27;s a damned sight better than having to rewrite my code all the time every time for each new device that comes out.<p>The last chunk of the article talks about the magical ~physics~ that this sort of thing will enable, because real-time raytracing is the the future right?

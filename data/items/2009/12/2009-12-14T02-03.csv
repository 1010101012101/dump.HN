Thus you cannot have ""any system"" but rather must a particular system, one ""at least a powerful as arithmetic"", one which is self-describing.<p>And this is where Anatoly's <i>false</i> distinction between ""syntactic"" and ""semanitc"" proofs breaks down. The proof of Goedel's theorem relies on these mechanics (one's ability to create Goedel numbering or the equivalent), these <i>semantics</i> of arithmetic. There is no Goedel's theoreom for Tarrot Cards because Tarrot Card don't have a set of rules which allow them to be self-describing.",1260759502

The default selection was based on users' previous settings <i>only if they had changed them in the past</i>, and as Facebook has pointed out, only 20% of people have done so.  That forces the rest of users to make a choice that most neither understand nor want to make.<p>People see Facebook as a way to privately share their life with friends.  That's the foundation on which Facebook was built - that's the core aspect that convinced people to abandon other social networks for FB - and now they are idiotically abandoning that core principal and needlessly exposing their users.<p>Personally, as a web app developer, I'm confused about the process myself.  The privacy dialog seemed to suggest that no matter what my settings are, my name, profile picture, and friends list will be public to all.  If I'm being given more choice about my privacy, why is this choice being taken away from me?  Until this point, I had the choice of being pretty much invisible from anyone but my friends.<p>Back when people used Myspace, it was quite open by default as well.  The difference is that on Myspace your name could be Donald Duck, your location could be set to Antarctica and nobody cared.  You could invent your own privacy controls where they didn't exist. Try doing something that on Facebook and your account will be instantly suspended.<p>This is not about users being dumb or not.

The change doesn't make everything public -- the settings vary by type of info and also I think it tries to preserve customizations (I'm not completely sure how that aspect works, but different people get different defaults as I understand it).

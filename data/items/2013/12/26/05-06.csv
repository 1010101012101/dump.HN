For instance, in a meeting that involves your boss, command your coworkers to do what they were all already going to do.  &quot;Commit that change and send out an email describing what you changed.&quot;  They can&#x27;t not do their job, so it appears to your boss that everyone else is taking orders from you.

It came on suddenly and rapidly became crippling as I kept trying to just fight through it. Eventually I started physio which included different types of therapy with machines, took a vacation, and messed with my set up when I got back (including a height adjustable standing desk) until it seemed to subside. I still had some tension now and again, but I&#x27;d massage it out and take frequent breaks and I was mitigating it well. Most days were completely pain free. A few months later it came back, at which point I was in the middle of exiting to take an opportunity with facebook.<p>I&#x27;m worried about moving to a new city, starting a new job, and having the pain come back. If that happens before I&#x27;ve proven myself as a good engineer, I won&#x27;t feel like I deserve seeing doctors or going to appointments on facebook&#x27;s dime.<p>I&#x27;m exploring all avenues now. I&#x27;ve read the mindbody prescription to determine if the pain is psychosomatic. I&#x27;m going to start daily yoga as I recall the pain starting sort of subsided with when I switched from yoga to crossfit. Stop and ice it as soon as it begins hurting, etc etc. Perhaps in the absolute worst case consider voice recognition software (but honestly, I feel like going from a fast typer in vi to using voice recognition will be crippling).<p>My question is really just for advice.

There is \nfluff about &quot;living search engine&quot;, &quot;social search engine&quot;\nand a few others.  I find no evidence for (or against) that \nthey have their own full Internet search engine.<p>The problem for new companies trying to take on Google is the immenseness of their infrastructure. Lets say you want to start your own search engine.<p>You have a great idea, some idea for your crawler, etc.\nGiven that you dont have 10 000s of servers to store and \nrun distributed searches etc you are at a great disadvantage.\nCan you do it with 5 servers in the cloud?  How much space does one complete index of the entire internet take now?<p>Back when Google started, their hardware was modest.",1388034840

In order the the app to break the developer must specifically change the API their app targets to KitKat without changing which key generation algorithm they use. I wish the docs [2] mentioned this change, but presumably if you&#x27;re developing apps you&#x27;ll be following the blog.<p>It would be very cool, and it&#x27;s certainly within Google&#x27;s capabilities, if Google emailed developers using PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1 to notify them.

Many people who were old enough  but did not get around to it are now getting around to it. New people are being born every day who might someday wish to read and enjoy the books. A quick check at Amazon shows that the books continue to sell well--and I think it is a good bet that most of those are for people who have not yet read them.<p>As far as the movie goes, it has just recently made it to non-premium pay TV. Many many people who get their movies via cable or satellite and do not have HBO but do have more than basic cable/satellite are getting around to seeing it.<p>So yes, it is a spoiler to many people.<p>I&#x27;ve seen the first 6 movies, and am currently about 1/4 of the way through book 6. I happened to have already known about the death of that particular character, so your post didn&#x27;t spoil anything for me, but I bet it did spoil it for some people here.<p>Some spoilers have become memes and catch phrases. Those new to Star Wars, for example, probably have no realistic chance of being surprised by what was the big shock to those of us who saw &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; in the theater in 1980. For those spoilers that have not become embedded in pop culture, though, I see no reason we need to go around blurting them out.",1388034548

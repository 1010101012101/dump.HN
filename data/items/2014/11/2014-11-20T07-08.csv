I remember the same issue when the certs expired 1,5 years ago. I really like Microsoft and was convinced &quot;you&quot; would somehow isolate the dashboard and host it separately, but it turns out I was wrong. Do you happen to know the reasons for hosting the status dashboard inside of Azure? It seems so counter-intuitive to me. Or is it actually hosted externally but died due to the load when the issue started to appear?<p>The OP mentions that Microsoft representatives gave info via public forums. When the issue appeared I looked in different places trying to find info, but only I found was a statement saying that We are aware of issues. I looked at Azure twitter/blog, ScottGu twitter/blog, Hanselmans, MSDN forums. I also tried this forum and reddit. Do you know where I should have gone to receive details?",1416470355

- Where do the keep the code that gets executed for new routes? Is that deployed dynamically as well?
- If you are changing routes dynamically how do you test in non-prod, are you constantly syncing non prod with prod?
- How do you control what you deploy dynamically vs what you migrate through the environments?",1416467909

Let say you extend it in-house, contractors move in, and you let them install the modified development environment on their laptops. Do you have to give them your changes upon request, licensed under the GPL?<p>Also, if you make a web-based product based on this, and a customer insists on hosting it in its cloud (many do because they do not want to, or in practice aren&#x27;t allowed to, let their data out of their systems), can you sell it?<p>In both cases, did your patents just get free for all to use?<p>The moment you let in GPL code, you either give up having non-GPL code in your company, or you have to start spending time keeping the GPL and non-GPL code apart.

8634694,comment,8632363,8632363,0,0,uuilly,,,"I worked at 510 for 2 years. We were a little over 10 people when I started and around 60 people when we sold to Google. The whole thing was bootstrapped, no VC&#x27;s. Bryon Majusiak, the guy interviewed in the article, is a great guy, a hard charger and a very practical engineer. So much so that I hired him away from Google a little less than a year ago for another robotics endeavor.<p>510 did many great things and got credit for nearly none of it. We barely had a website b/c big companies like Google, Microsoft and Nokia liked letting people think it was all them. Quite frankly, we were happy to take the money, but in hindsight, we should have aimed higher.<p>The article gives the impression that we only did hardware. That is not true. We did all the sensor integration and real-time systems software. We also sold our GPS filter to Google early on for Street View.<p>It was a scrappy place. We solved hard problems very quickly and big companies often resented us for it and reluctantly bought our wares. In return we were silent.<p>The employees were fantastic and the management was horrendous. We laughed a lot, we fought a lot and we drank a lot. The founders, like most 20 somethings who&#x27;ve achieved too much success too early, were amazing in many ways but deeply flawed. They did not realize that the Berkeley Robotics Lab did not prepare them to manage a real company. They could never see that they were the ones in the way of their own success. Since there were no VC&#x27;s there was no board. I never again worked for a place where the CEO could not be fired. And I never worked for a founder who had too many life lessons in front of him.<p>Anyways, lessons learned: The value is in final products not in parts of products, people don&#x27;t change on a startup&#x27;s timeline and getting acquired is generally a letdown.<p>Onwards and upwards...",1416467799

Initially CPM was $1.70, then a few months later it was $4, now 6 months later it&#x27;s $9. At this point it became unviable.<p>I spoke to our account manager at Facebook and he confirmed my suspicions. Every time one of our customers converts though our ads, Facebook assigns a high value to that user, since that user purchased something through a FB ad. So now I have more competition to get in front of our existing customer from our competition who our customer is not interested in. FUCK THAT. Moral of the story DO NOT tell Facebook about conversions from your existing customers. Keep that info to yourself.",1416467569

Basically some additional mojo can be had a funding discussions if you can legitimately claim to be a &#x27;founder&#x27; of some previous success (the bigger the better). Especially in social settings it is strange (and to my twisted humor funny) when people will say they &#x27;worked&#x27; at one company and &#x27;founded&#x27; another company when they had the exact same role in each company at the same level of development and differ only in the perception of &#x27;success&#x27; or &#x27;not success&#x27;.<p>After reading the article on how primates use &#x27;fame&#x27; in dominance games that made the rounds here I found that it identified that sort of behavior pretty precisely.",1416467235

Advertising is ""good"" in the same sense that pollution is good:  in a world without it, much of what we love wouldn't exist.  The assumption that Google or Facebook ad revenue reflects value delivered to their users is extremely, extremely dubious, and I don't even see a prima facie case for it.  When a rational actor spends money, that's good evidence that it is receiving value, but nobody would model a Facebook user making purchases as a rational actor.  If they did, the ads would look rather different.  So what basis do we have for saying that effective ads benefit users, except as a way of funding the service by extracting payment from users' attention budgets instead of from their bank accounts?<p>At one time, people loved seeing smokestacks belching smoke because that meant prosperity, jobs, and abundance.  On HN, I think we feel the same way about ads.  More effective ads on the web means more prosperity, more employment, and more products for us to enjoy.<p><i>Both Google and Facebook were born out of an interest to improve the world and solve a problem</i><p>I give credit to Google for having a corporate culture that reflects its founders, but in the long run, survival and profit are more fundamental in a corporation's hierarchy of needs.  With Google we probably won't know exactly when it becomes just like AT&T or GM or any other large corporation; we'll recognize it sometime after the fact.  Even in their current state, they're still a business with accountants, investors, and quarterly statements.  The people who work there are ambitious and want to buy nice stuff; they get goals and reviews and promotions.   All the elements that cause corporations to operate at a much lower moral level than the people they're made of are present.  The corporate culture can only hold those forces back for so long.<p>As for Facebook, when did people start regarding them as a benevolent, well-intentioned company (distinct from their great product which really does improve the world?)  I knew they were out to change the world and shape the future, but it seemed like <i>improving</i> the world happened as a side effect.<p><i>They usually stagnate, alienate their users and only maintain market share by ensuring users have no other choice.</i><p>First, you're describing the corporations that emerged victorious from previous great changes; don't underestimate how dominant that behavior can be.  Someday, long after Google's ""not evil"" ethic is no longer an asset they have to lose, standard corporate tactics will be the best way for them to deliver shareholder value.  And the shareholders will get their value.  Second, it sounds like you're describing Facebook right now.  I have Diaspora and Google+ accounts, but of course Facebook is the one I check all the time.  Facebook can do almost <i>anything</i> to me and not lose me as a customer, for the simple reason that current social networks don't interoperate and therefore social networking accounts aren't portable from one provider to another in any meaningful way.<p>EDIT (abusing the edit function to reply):  I agree with you that calling Facebook or any other company ""malevolent"" is incorrect.  I think it's better to say that sometimes a company's interests are aligned with the interests of their users, and sometimes they aren't.  I also agree that it looks like Google's and even Facebook's interests are aligned with their users' interests in many ways.  However, that will change someday, and the very smart guys at Google and Facebook will start acting on that change of interest before we even recognize it.<p>Also, I really don't see it as them ""tricking"" us.  They aren't doing anything deceitful or morally wrong.  They're just doing their job, which is to deliver profitable ad clicks to the advertisers who pay them.  We don't have to pretend that they're doing it out of the goodness of their hearts (or that their advertising is good for us) in order to respect what they do and appreciate the service they provide.",1326941121

The arguments for physical property simply don't apply to ideas, and I've never heard a sound and compelling argument for why ideas should be ownable. This is especially true for software and digital media, since they are literally integers. Owning a piece of software is equivalent to owning an integer, something that I claim is ludicrous.<p>When you talk about ""obtaining something"" for free, what you're really doing is creating a copy of something.

3482979,comment,3482333,3482814,4,0,samlev,,,"Youtube and vimeo probably weren't originally designed as ""distribution systems for the little guy"", so much as ""I want to share this cat video/student film"". The point being that they weren't meant to be a distribution system any more than a DVD in and of itself is a distribution system. They're a type of <i>media</i> which makes the work of distribution systems easier. Blogs were, at the time, the distribution system, and youtube/vimeo were a new, easy to use media that made distributing to a wide audience easier (no more 'codec' issues, etc.)<p>The fact that they have <i>become</i> distribution systems in their own right is a testament to the fact that content creators will always create, and will try to distribute their creations in any way that they can. People will often use something counter to it's original design, and it's smart companies that can recognise that use and restructure their operation around it.<p>The problem isn't that only the big guys get into the cinemas - in a free market, that might still be the case. The problem is that the little guys <i>can't</i> get into the cinemas, no matter how high the quality of their product. The only way that they can is by bowing down and paying fealty to the big studios who <i>didn't actually contribute anything to the production</i>.<p>The problem that the big companies are encountering now is that new media has been showing up which works without their tightly controlled distribution methods. Want to make a TV series? You no longer have to sell it to a studio or be stuck on some form of local station. You can distribute it yourself, to more people than the traditional methods would ever allow, and you can do it <i>easier</i>. The problem that the studios have is that you no longer need to be on a TV show or in a cinema to get seen. They're not entirely irrelevant yet, but they're no longer the only way to view content.<p>The problem with piracy is that people are taking the job of distribution out of the hands of the people who either created or paid for the rights to distribute it. It's a big blow for companies that add no real value other than distribution, which is why they're claiming massive losses and jobs lost. They can't reconcile the idea that you can make as much money (if not more) by selling the same product at a lower cost to a wider audience. The pirates saw an opportunity and stepped in. Once the big companies can figure out how to adapt their business models to meet what consumers actually want, they'll start to make a profit, and everyone will be all the better for it.<p>The last thing that this opening of the market (and that's what this internet revolution is) means is that quality will increase. Once distribution isn't a case of ""You get what you're given, and you'll thank us for it"", then the producers of content will have to start competing not in price but in quality for the consumer's dollar. People can pick what they want to watch when, now. They don't <i>have</i> to catch it at the cinema or have to go without until it makes it to DVD. To make them want to watch something at the cinema, then the product actually has to be <i>worth</i> watching at a cinema. If you want someone to pay money for your DVD box set, you have to make it <i>worth</i> spending money on. If there's something getting produced which you can get for cheaper, in a way that's more convenient to you, then the content would have to be amazing to get you to pay for the more expensive option.<p>Anyway, this has been a long, rambly rant. I'm hoping that I didn't cloud issues too much, or tangent too often, or outright contradict myself. Every word I wrote, I meant at the time I was writing it.",1326940859

3482972,comment,3481996,3482781,3,0,hesitz,,,"It's impossible to completely avoid ambiguity and vagueness in law.  Lawyers don't enact laws, legislators do.  And lawyers don't ""tolerate ambiguity""; lawyers exist in large part because it takes experts to know how enacted laws will be interpreted by courts (in part because of their inevitable vagueness and ambiguity).  Legislators can and usually do try to lessen ambiguity and vagueness in laws they enact, with varying degrees of success.  (Like I said, there will virtually _always_ arise factual situations where a law previously though unambiguous and clear turns out to be not to have been unambiguous and clear _enough_. It is the nature of language and rule-making.  E.g., how does one supposedly clear and unambiguous law interact with another clear and unambiguous law when they conflict and require different things?  Or another example, how should a court interpret a particular statutory provision that, as written, appears to conflict with the general intent of the Act the provision is in?  Interpret the particular provision as it reads in isolation? or interpret the provision in a way that seems somewhat odd when it's read in isolation but which makes perfect sense within its Act as a whole?)<p>I don't know about your iPhone TOS.  You could do some research and/or retain a lawyer to get a legal opinion on what the law requires, which is presumably what a court would do if confronted with your case.  If the issue (or a nearly identical issue) has previously been litigated, then the previous court decision will have some (varying) degree of precedential value for your own case.<p>In case of you and your iPhone issue, this is nothing new.  Many everyday situations arise where there simply is no practical way to dispute another party's interpretation of a contract or license.  This sort of ""do what you can until somebody stops you"" has been going on forever.  (Class actions exist as one way to avoid this problem in situations where numerous individuals with limited resources are wronged in same way by a more powerful defendant, but the solution they provide is limited at best.)",1326940748

It's a good technique to know for efficiently searching <i>any</i> two columns simultaneously.  If you have, for example, a database of people, their hometown, and their favorite color, and you want to know all people from Chicago that like green, a spacial index over color and hometown will be vastly more efficient than a ""regular"" single-column index over any one of those columns.  (The reason is that an index on one column doesn't efficiently produce a small resultset.  If we index on color and there are five colors, an index over color only reduces the dataset by 1/5th.  Similarly, indexing over hometown might reduce the size of the dataset by 1/1000th.  But if we index over both columns at the same time, then the only results that the index will ever produce are results that are the exact answer to our question.  No unnecessary scanning!)<p>Anyway, lat/long might be the easiest ""pair"" of columns to imagine when discussing anything ""spatial"", but most other two-column pairs work the exact same way.",1326940394

However, I'd just like to point something out.<p>According to this article and many others, we all ""pirate stuff"" because it's ""easier than the paid model""... well, the same goes for driving a car.<p>I would much rather just walk into my underground parking lot, hotwire a car, and ditch it once I got to my destination. But, I have morals.<p>I am not likening stealing a car to copyright infringement, only pointing out the reasoning that ""I pirate because it's easier to do so"" isn't really a moral/valid point.<p>It's easier for me to kill you instantly with my gun than it is for me to reason with you about a topic I don't care to reason about, too.",1326938819

I remember someone once mentioning the Nigerian film industry as an example. Everything there is pirated, but they make their movies with the expectation that they have ~2 weeks to make their money before piracy becomes rampant.<p>I'm sure that large $100-million movies won't be made in such a world, but I've never really heard anyone respond to whether or not that is a good or bad thing.

If a pirate pirates a movie, it is incredibly unlikely that he/she is going to then go buy the movie.<p>And yes, I do imply (and even say outright) that people who pirate would buy if they couldn't pirate, but not all of them. Probably only a very small proportion of them would buy a movie if they couldn't pirate it. However, if only one person would buy the movie out of the hundreds that pirate it, it would net the producing and distributing companies a loss, which is all that would need to happen for my argument to have sound backing.",1326938588

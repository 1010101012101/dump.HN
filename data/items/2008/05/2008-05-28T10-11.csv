201954,comment,201373,201949,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Weird.  I lived three blocks from Furman.  It was my playground, growing up.  We played video games in the student center using change fished out of the fountain beside it, flirted embarrassingly with the college girls, skateboarded and biked all over, and regularly got kicked out after the campus closed for the day (for those unfamiliar with small Southern Baptist liberal arts schools, or at least Furman, they close all of the gates except the main gate at 10PM and only allow students in).<p>Speaking of Bob Jones, no one ever believes me when I explain that it has a ""date room"", wherein couples sit together in a chaperoned room, with a Bible-width space in between.  Which explains why Bob Jones girls are such a terror when they do manage to escape the watchful eyes of the school.",1211972059

I'm from Greenville (which sends the message, ""How can we be more like Atlanta?"", or at least it did when I last lived there 14 years ago).  Small world.<p>The message in Charleston definitely has something about aristocracy and the value of old money, while the message in the rest of the coastal towns generally involves fishing.  Except Myrtle Beach, where the message is, ""Y'all come on down for a visit, and leave your money when you head back up north.""",1211971228

201939,comment,201844,201844,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"You're reading way too much into one piece of advice.  The whole ""eating from the bottom"" thing is a time honored tradition in the computer industry.  IBM mainframes were eaten from the bottom by Digital systems, which were eaten from the bottom by Data General mini-computers, which were eaten from the bottom by PCs, which will be eaten from the bottom by mobile devices.<p>But, your problem is not a paradigm shift that alters the competitive landscape.  Your problem is a competitor with unsustainable pricing.  Don't play that game.  It's foolish and you'll lose more customers than you win by playing it.  You'll also dig yourself an early grave (figuratively, and possibly literally, if you take your business too seriously).<p>Ignore your foolish competitor.  Build better products, charge the right price for them (you may still be too cheap), and keep working.  The low-priced competitor will continue to lowball his bids, and will eventually get a reputation for under-serving and over-promising.  In a year or two, you'll have a chance to re-bid the same customers you lose this year.  And the customer won't be so interested in getting the product cheaply.",1211970063

201934,comment,201553,201553,0,0,enra,,,"Williams On Copyright: Wrong<p>First, what is with the ""music goes down""-statement. Arrington just said that ""a new era of free recorded music and paid live performances is a very good thing"". Lots of things are free and still up and running (eg. this site, tv, radio..).<p>""Second, there is no evidence <i>at all</i> that free music on the Internet is an effective"". Ok, but there is. Next.<p>""Third, if the recorded music industry goes down, concert sales will not grow â€“ they will shrink."" There is no evidence that it would happen like this. First, marketing efforts results are usually hard to measure. Second, cleary marketing isn't the only thing, or even the most important thing on creating demand. It's the music.<p>If we get back to the original Youtube-Viacom case, what's the harm if you watch some clips of the Office from Youtube? It isn't like you were going to buy the dvdbox, just for watching it at work while sipping your coffee, but you might buy it afterwards, because it got your attention again.<p>Ok, I understand that Viacom has the copyrights, and Youtube is making money of them. This dispute, as many others, isn't about ethics, morale, downgrading our culture, terrorism or ripping of the artists. It's just about money. You can even watch South Park for free on their own site",1211969047

201931,comment,201553,201731,0,0,hank777,,,"I am the article author. Actually, the arctic monkeys <i>do not</i> give away their music free on their website or on myspace. Second, the group is successful because along with making great music, they have a great, very hard working 15 year old label called Domino, who also have for example, Franz Ferdinand. So Arctic monkeys is <i>not</i> internet based despite what you may think, has a real record label that puts money and marketing efforts behind them, and doesn't give their music away free. I am not saying that artists that have websites or myspace pages cant succeed obviously. Almost all artists have myspace pages so that would be silly. I am saying you cant just put your stuff up on the net, do nothing else, and expect to make a living -- particularly if you are giving away your music which is where Arrington thinks everything should go.",1211968885

Every single person watching a Twitch stream is an IRC user, whether they know it or not.<p>How do you determine the popularity of something? How many people use it.<p>Android is extremely popular. Do most of the folks realize they&#x27;re using an Android phone? Nope.<p>Does it mean Android isn&#x27;t popular? Nope.<p>If you don&#x27;t have a similar understanding, we&#x27;ll have to agree to disagree.<p>> The point is more that it&#x27;s dying out as measured by people who say to their colleagues e.g. &quot;jump on IRC, I&#x27;ve got something to tell you.&quot;<p>Of course they wouldn&#x27;t, you&#x27;re already speaking with them. Slack is fine for trusted networks of peers (businesses), but not much else. I won&#x27;t start chatting with any my friends using it, nor would I bother to sign up somewhere to get access to a random Slack channel/community instead of using IRC, where I also coincidentally wouldn&#x27;t need any of Slack&#x27;s features.",1446422367

Does popularity necessarily imply superiority? Adoption just means it&#x27;s easy for anyone to get aboard. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s implicitly good, in any other way. Worse is better works, for example, if one option is more approachable than the other. Decentralization is good, as a rule of the thumb. Not having everyone on the same network, but having the ability to set up your own network or service based on the technology, is a good thing. Why would you want to have everyone on the same network? Networks are often topic-related. For example Freenode for programming-related topics. Minecraft is pretty focused on EsperNet. Quakenet used to be the place to online gaming. This is usefull and good, since communities sort themselves by interest, views, tools or what have you, by default. So why not encourage self-sustainability through means of decentralization?",1446422132

Not the whole story.<p>Not that it matters much, but it&#x27;s one of the constantly repeated points of Russian propaganda - that Ukraine is a temporary state with no history.<p>And considering the defense as explanation for military conquests of Russia - which country in the west was supposed to invade Russia through Ukraine? Eastern EU and NATO members, with no power to do that by themselves, no nuclear detterent, much smaller military budgets, and no territorial demands in Russia?<p>I propose different explanation: Russia is governed by Putin for over a decade, he promised &quot;prosperity instead of freedom&quot;, and delivered till 2013, mostly thanks to high oil prices. Ukraine was always portraited by Russia as &quot;almost Russia&quot;, and Ukrainians started revolutions to win &quot;freedom and prosperity&quot; through eventual accession to EU.<p>Putin couldn&#x27;t allow that to success, because if that is possible in Ukraine - it&#x27;s possible in Russia.

And all of this, being tightly integrated into the Chromium codebase, was subject to change at any point with no guarantee of API stability.<p>Maybe things have changed since then, but at the point when (P)NaCl was receiving the most attention I found it entirely impenetrable.

People try their best with models and paleo- studies, but it&#x27;s far, far from ideal. As a result, the IPCC must use other methods to assess consensus.<p>Many of the fundamental tenets of climate science are reproducible and falsifiable (absorption spectra of the atmosphere with different pollutants; the effect of acidification on marine carbonates; the ways in which glacier ice deforms and flows, as examples).

10488948,comment,10486717,10487067,0,0,Lazare,,,"Problem:  Insider trading isn&#x27;t about illegally obtained information.  The SEC defines insider trading as:<p>> &quot;Illegal insider trading refers generally to buying or selling a security, in breach of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence, while in possession of material, nonpublic information about the security.&quot;<p>So if I hack into someone&#x27;s server and steal a bunch of secret financial data, and use that to trade, then I am trading based on illegally obtained information, but I am not committing insider trading, because I have no fiduciary duty or relationship of trust and confidence.<p>Conversely, if I&#x27;m a director of a company being acquired, and I trade on my knowledge of the acquisition before it is announced, my knowledge was not illegally obtained, but I am violating a fiduciary duty to the company.<p>As a general rule (there are exceptions!) insider trading never involves illegally obtained information.  It&#x27;s either illegal information I wasn&#x27;t meant to know, or it&#x27;s information I was meant to know but wasn&#x27;t meant to trade on.<p>(Note that the news recently broke of a Ukrainian hacking group that was stealing unreleased press releases and selling them to traders.  Headlines almost universally called the group an &quot;insider trading ring&quot;, but what they seem to have committed was wire fraud[1].  The SEC is gamely trying to pin some security fraud charges on them, because that&#x27;s what the SEC does, but the plain text of the underlying law is against them, and that theory has yet to prevail in court.)<p>In the Dell/hedge fund case the New Yorker is talking about, it seems clear that the Dell analyst had a fiduciary duty to Dell, although he was never charged with insider trading, probably because he didn&#x27;t trade.  And the hedge fund guys clearly traded, but they didn&#x27;t have a fiduciary duty to Dell.  Nor could prosecutors point to some sort of exchange where the Dell guy swapped insider information with someone who then traded.  If the information had been <i>stolen</i>, then it might still have been a crime (even if not insider trading).  But apparently, it wasn&#x27;t stolen.<p>In short:  Insider trading is about trading in violating of a fiduciary duty or a relationship of trust and confidence.  It&#x27;s not about trading based on illegal information.  This is true despite the fact that a lot of people sort of think it would make sense if it was otherwise.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/18/business/dealbook/hacking-case-raises-question-on-securities-fraud.html?ref=dealbook&_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/18/business/dealbook/hacking-...</a><p>Edit:  A further point of clarification; insider trading law is written to protect a company from the misappropriation of their secrets by insiders for their own benefit.  In the example being discussed, it&#x27;s intended to protect Dell from being harmed by their investor relations guy (Rob Ray, in this case), and it clearly allows the prosecution of Ray if he used Dell&#x27;s material nonpublic information for his own benefit.  Except, in this case, there&#x27;s no accusation or evidence that he did; he seems to have been trying to use Dell&#x27;s information for <i>Dell&#x27;s</i> benefit, and didn&#x27;t benefit personally at all.  That&#x27;s actually legal.  (Well, Dell actually has some rules on what they can let their investor relation&#x27;s people share, but if those rules were violated then Dell or Ray would be in trouble, not the people they told, and it still wouldn&#x27;t be insider trading.)  But as far as insider trading law goes, the only real possible victim is Dell (it was <i>their</i> information), and the only real possible criminal was Ray, or <i>maaaybe</i> a close relative of Ray, a golf buddy, roomate, etc., or maybe someone who paid Ray to victimise Dell.  But Bharara didn&#x27;t go after Ray or anyone who knew Ray, and he didn&#x27;t phrase the issue in terms of the damage done to Dell, and that was fundamentally at odds with how insider trading law works.<p>What Bharara seemed to want is a law that protects small investors from hedge fund traders, not a law that protected Dell from Ray.  He&#x27;s not obviously wrong to want such a law, but he was wrong to think one existed.  In any case, keep in mind when discussing insider trading law as it currently stands:  It will make <i></i>ZERO<i></i> sense unless you remember that it was written to protect Dell from people like Ray, rather than mutual funds from people like Steve Cohen.  Even if Dell doesn&#x27;t really need to be protected from their own investor relation&#x27;s flaks, and mutual funds really need to be protected from Steve Cohen.",1446420187

Moreover, I have <i>much</i> more faith in abilities and reasonableness of the OpenRC Cabal than I do those of the Systemd Cabal.<p>> True - but that is a good question by itself right ? Why...<p>I&#x27;ll ask again. Can you get into specifics about why &quot;[d]eploying web-services on systemd is so much better...&quot;? All I&#x27;m getting from you is soundbites and equivocation.<p>> ...[systemd] is making my linux machine extremely stable...<p>In the ~20 years that I&#x27;ve been using Linux, I&#x27;ve <i>never</i> had instability introduced by an init or RC system. What init or RC-induced instability have you observed in <i>your</i> Linux systems?<p>>  Supervisord ... [has the] same concept of unit files, declarative language,etc ...<p>Does this mean that that the meaning of the keywords and parameters in supervisord&#x27;s config files is <i>very</i> close or identical to those in systemd? Or does it <i>just</i> mean that supervisord&#x27;s configuration files are in .INI format, just like systemd&#x27;s?<p>If the latter, then who cares?<p>1) Superficial syntax similarities do not necessarily enhance understanding. In cases where similar keywords mean differing things in two different systems, they can (and often do) cause confusion and misunderstanding.<p>2) Startup files for services whose startup sequence is the <i>most</i> complex you can handle in a systemd unit file are equally terse and readable in both systemd and OpenRC. [0] If the startup requirements are <i>more</i> complex than this, systemd <i>has</i> to call out to a shell script(!) or other external program. OpenRC (and other sysvrc replacements) that use interpreted startup scripts can bake such functionality right <i>in</i> to the startup script. This means that -in these systems- you only need to ship and maintain <i>one</i> file, rather than two. ;)<p>> Where is [systemd] making everyone&#x27;s life hard...<p>Systemd is worrisome for several reasons:<p>1) systemd&#x27;s scope continues to creep.<p>2) The Systemd Cabal continues to assert that pretty much every part of systemd is optional. An <i>honest</i> look at the state of systemd and projects like Gnome puts the lie to that statement.<p>3) Systemd continues to assert that systemd is faster than anything out there. Real-world observation indicates that this means that they&#x27;ve never heard of -say- OpenRC.<p>4) The Systemd Cabal continues to assert that systemd is modular. They assert that <i>anyone</i> can read their documentation and reimplement any part of systemd. <i>Many</i> people have attempted to do this and found the documentation sorely lacking.<p>5) The Systemd Cabal <i>aggressively</i> refuses patches that fix breakage that they introduced by changing decades-old  behavior for no better reason than &quot;The behavior was legacy and thus broken.&quot;. [4]<p>In short, the attitudes of the people in charge of the project are <i>dreadfully</i> worrisome. Having udrepper in charge of glibc was bad enough. Systemd&#x27;s devs are <i>substantially</i> more bullheaded, and the project itself is angling to swallow almost all of Linux userspace.<p>[0] See Nailer&#x27;s representative systemd unit file at [1] and my conversion of it to an OpenRC startup script. [2] Also, notice the confusion that one has when one is not already familiar with the keywords contained in a systemd unit file.

Then there&#x27;s no role for government, as the government exists to &quot;guarantee&quot; things (notably, life and liberty).  That is anarchism, not libertarianism.<p>I&#x27;m curious -- when you simulate your ideal society in your mind, at what kind of stable state do you arrive?  I understand and sympathize with some of the same philosophical _first principles_ you do, but when I play it out in my mind I don&#x27;t get to a world in which I&#x27;d like to live.  In fact, the world I end up with is one in which life and liberty are routinely and casually stolen from others -- not by a state, necessarily, but by other forms of powerful self-interested organizations.  Gangs, mafias, private armies.  Coercive forces.<p>Of course there will be positively intentioned organizations to attempt to counteract these coercive forces.  Unfortunately, they won&#x27;t be able to compete because they suffer from a huge handicap: they lack the ability to coerce others to their cause.<p>So that&#x27;s where it ends up in my mind.  Epic failure, for the exact reason marxist Capitalism would fail: human self-interest.<p>Where does it end up in yours?  If you&#x27;ve played this out and it end somewhere good, I think you must have a very positive and optimistic view of humanity.",1446418898

I barely hear anyone about it, haven&#x27;t used it in a long time. It, too, is pretty much dominated by professional sellers now. If you look for product XYZ the first full page of hits (it&#x27;s beyond ridiculous) are dedicated sellers who paid for the spot or just spam the same stuff. All of the 2nd hand trading by me and my peers now goes through FB trading groups, a natural platform to communicate in text, post images of the product, negotiate prices, get a sense of identity/trust etc. This was great for about a year, but right now all of the few FB groups I used to frequent are seeing timed posts advertising professional services and products which keep popping up on my feed, drowning out the real sellers and causing me to delist myself from the group.<p>New niche marketplaces pretty much keep popping up that grow pretty quickly until they&#x27;re big enough to get spammed by professional accounts looking for new sales channels.",1446418887

Furthermore, it seems like we&#x27;ve already forgotten that telephones are <i>supposed to be reliable</i>.<p>Take the Android Hangouts App for instance. In using it for a year, I&#x27;ve yet to have a non-buggy experience. First, the phone would stop ringing for incoming calls. Recently half of my outgoing calls will fail to open the audio device, so the other end can hear me but I can&#x27;t hear them. Nevermind the everpresent dropped calls where the app just <i>disappears</i>. If your response is to say &quot;yeah, but that&#x27;s a downmarket VOIP app&quot; then you&#x27;ve proven my point, given that it is published by one of the largest web companies around.<p>Bell engineers made reliability a design goal. Internet engineering assumed poor reliability could be compensated by endpoint software - this works really well for layer 3, but by the time you get to layer 6 and 7 you should really stop kicking that can down the road!<p>Your landline keeps working in a power outage because every CO is full of lead acid batteries, all the equipment runs off of a 48VDC rail, and power is even supplied to end-user devices so they continue to work as well. From the SV viewpoint this is obviously a complete and utter waste, but it&#x27;s awfully nice to be able to communicate in a power outage (especially as emergencies tend to compound).<p>Nevermind the modern standard of ridiculous UI latency. The general guideline for an imperceptible delay is 10ms - that&#x27;s <i>10 million</i> instructions at 1GHz.

Why bother spending design time up front when you can punt to soft controls, and then release &quot;updates&quot; if you&#x27;re ever taken to task?<p>So no, I have little faith that our self driving car future won&#x27;t involve a lot of abrupt stopping (because presumably the motor controllers will be engineered [correctly]) due to some undiagnosable error, and then a 2 minute wait while the system reboots.

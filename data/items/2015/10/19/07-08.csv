They will have their own new taste, needs, etc.<p>The thing to understand before you think about investing your hard earned money in an asian country - is even though the volume of amazing ventures are a lot more - each smart ventures is followed by 1000s of dumb ones.<p>The signal to noise ratio in low - unless your are in the market - you will be scammed - this is why a lot of large companies have tried and failed to start industries all over asia.<p>Anytime you start pouring a lot of money anywhere - govt, scammers, etc all want to dig into you. Red-Tape, bribery, lack of transparency and rule of law.<p>This is not as overwhelmingly present in European or american markets.<p>I do not for a second doubt that the market size, growth, etc are going to be insane in asia for the foreseeable future - but there is a question of sustainability - and this requires structural change in government in many asian countries.<p>Unless you are interested in short term - high risk - high reward outcome. And are more interested in long term investment - then Asia needs some reform before you think about investing big time there.",1445241582

10411680,comment,10411393,10411635,0,0,byuu,,,"> the library is written in a language with manual memory management and unsafe memory access.<p>C&#x27;s simplicity is certainly a blessing and a curse. Right now, I&#x27;m of the opinion that C++ is the best we&#x27;ve got, even if not perfectly ideal. RAII, shared pointers and smart containers with bounds checking allows you to keep <i>nearly</i> all of the performance without the drastic downsides of tracing garbage collectors (obscene amounts of memory usage, nasty stalls, etc.)<p>And when you get into the really high-level languages (Python, Ruby), they simply don&#x27;t scale.<p>Everyone&#x27;s darling right now is Rust. I still think it&#x27;s too early in its life to know how it&#x27;ll play out (hot new languages follow a predictable path of gaining negative baggage and shortcomings as they increase in real-world usage), but I guess we&#x27;ll see. Maybe it will indeed be a great panacea to these issues.<p>> In this case, the affected component was related to the identity part (certificates), which are needed for verifiability. It was not directly related to secrecy.<p>Sure, but I&#x27;m generalizing here.<p>I can (and did) write a SHA256 hashing algorithm in 3KiB of code. Combined with a package gist updater (these use signing with local keys for updates), that&#x27;s enough to secure binary package downloads on the BSDs over plain-text HTTP.<p>Surely we can come up with a less complex system for verification alone. Something akin to signify, perhaps. I know that doesn&#x27;t solve how to universally handle anonymously verifying public key authenticity, but surely we can make something less complex than the clusterfuck that is TLS and the CAs. Yet it doesn&#x27;t seem there&#x27;s much, if any, interest in even trying. Everyone has hitched their wagons to HTTP/2 and mandatory TLS; which to me feels like a huge step backward by means of making tech <i>vastly</i> more complex.",1445241512

10411669,comment,10411317,10411317,0,0,jamer,,,"TL;DR: OS X is a Unix, while iOS is merely Unix-like but cannot, due to legal reasons, be called a Unix. Neither are based on Linux, which is itself another Unix-like but not a Unix.<p>Unix is a complicated concept and it has embodied different things in the past decades. It started out simply enough as a single body of code (with various additional patches made by different groups using it) and a trademark on the name at AT&T in the &#x27;70s. AT&T partnered with various educational institutions to help explore the concepts in Unix. The most important of these educational institutions was University of California, Berkeley which created its own patches for Unix and called them BSD (&quot;Berkeley Software Distribution&quot;). In the early &#x27;80s, AT&T decided it could make money by licensing the code out to commercial third parties, giving sale and binary redistribution rights. The many licensees (major ones were IBM, HP, Sun, and Microsoft) added additional code to their versions of Unix, much of which implemented similar features but which were all slightly incompatible with each other. In order to reign in the incompatibilities, various standards were created, such as the various versions of POSIX, and a Unix vendor could pay to be certified as meeting one of these standards. In the early &#x27;90s, AT&T sued Berkeley so Berkeley decided to rewrite all the copyrighted parts of BSD with freely-licensed reimplementations. Later in the &#x27;90s, AT&T sold the rights to the Unix intellectual property to Novell, who eventually transferred it to X/Open Consortium, who later merged with OSF and ultimately became the Open Group, where it remains today[1].<p>GNU/Linux is an operating system created in the early &#x27;90s that was heavily inspired by Unix (we say it is &quot;Unix-like&quot;), but which does not use any copyrighted Unix code and which is not certified as meeting any of the Unix compatibility standards. Due to its free nature, a belief that it was &quot;good enough&quot; for various commercial purposes, and its avoidance of violating the Unix copyright, it became a nice alternative to the licensed Unixes in the &#x27;90s, since many of those cost money, or were then in legally ambiguous situations.[2] The Linux kernel itself has continued to grow over the years and is now used for various operating systems beyond just GNU/Linux, the biggest of which is probably Android. As far as I know, none of the Linux-based operating systems today are certified by the Open Group.<p>Meanwhile, Mac OS X is based partially on BSD, which was not considered an official Unix, especially after AT&T&#x27;s lawsuit. At some point, Apple decided to pursue Mac OS X compliance with the Open Group&#x27;s UNIX 03 standard, which just required meeting a lot of technical requirements, and first got it with Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard. This makes Mac OS X an official Unix. El Capitan retains the UNIX 03 certification.[3] Since iOS, watchOS, and tvOS are based on Mac, they are Unix-like. But they&#x27;re missing a lot of the requirements from any of the official Unix standards and so cannot be legally called Unixes.<p>Also, since none of Apple&#x27;s operating systems use the Linux kernel it would be incorrect to say they were a flavor of Linux.<p>Hope this helps!<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix</a><p>[2] &quot;Just for Fun&quot; by Linus Torvalds. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/0066620732"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/0066620732</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/brand3612.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/brand3612.htm</a>",1445241299

I guess the reason for this surprisingly restrictive license is/was the version 1/first release character of the software (namespace Windows&quot;Preview&quot;.Media.Ocr).<p>The good news: In Win 10 the separate library is gone and the OCR feature is a regular part of Windows (Windows.Media.Ocr namespace). Along with this, the separate OCR runtime license is gone. -> I could not find any hint that the new OcrEngine class (or Windows Store apps in general!) have similar &quot;no server use&quot; restrictions -> I will move the OCR app to a Win 10 platform asap.<p>And while I can not speak for Microsoft, I have good reasons to assume that the ocr api service is doing Microsoft a favor by advertising the great Win 10 OCR features. My web service allows for quick prototyping and testing on any platform. But ultimately no web api can be as responsive as a native OCR solution - which is only available on the Windows platform.<p>I would not be surprised if the OCR engine shows up in Windows Server 2016, directly usable from ASP.NET.",1445241073

Then getting deep into something and having it lead you where you never expected.

It took me the better part of a decade to see that&quot;<p>- &quot;the stock objections raised by atheists against the traditional arguments for God’s existence are often aimed at caricatures, some of them do have at least some force against some of the arguments of modern philosophers of religion.  But they do not have force against the key arguments of the classical theist tradition.&quot;<p>Begins to question the nature of what we can know through science.<p>- &quot;I came to see that existing naturalistic accounts of language and meaning were no good.&quot;<p>- &quot;Physics, which materialists take to be the gold standard of our knowledge of the material world, in fact doesn’t give us knowledge of the intrinsic nature of matter in the first place.&quot;<p>- &quot;The usual materialist theories were not even clearly thought out, much less correct.&quot;<p>- &quot;A complete naturalistic explanation of intentionality is impossible.&quot;<p>- &quot;Introspection, ...gives us direct knowledge of our thoughts and experiences. ...it is matter, and not mind, that is the really problematic side of the mind-body problem&quot;<p>Takes a serious look at Aquinas and Scholastics, finds it very solid to his surprise<p>- &quot;The way I and so many other philosophers tended to read the Five Ways was, as I gradually came to realize, laughably off base.&quot;<p>- &quot;when they did say anything about Aquinas’s arguments at all, most of them showed only that they couldn’t even be bothered to get him right, much less show why he was mistaken.&quot;<p>- &quot;Eventually it hit me: “Oh my goodness, these arguments are right after all!”<p>- &quot;a little philosophy leads you away from God, but learning a lot of philosophy leads you back&quot;<p>My favorite part of this post is how he really captures what I am certainly guilty of and I am sure so many of us are. Rather than really listen we prepare our argument which is really a way of building up our wall of existing belief. Of course that makes sense if you&#x27;re feeling challenged you want to see if they can knock it down (hoping they can&#x27;t) but really we should respect each other a bit more and just listen with an open mind and heart. It would save a lot of time I suspect.<p>&quot;...to read something is not necessarily to understand it.  Partly, of course, because when you’re young, you always understand less than you think you do.  But mainly because, to understand someone, it’s not enough to sit there tapping your foot while he talks.  You’ve got to listen, rather than merely waiting for a pause so that you can insert the response you’d already formulated before he even opened his mouth.  And when you’re a young man who thinks he’s got the religious question all figured out, you’re in little mood to listen -- especially if you’ve fallen in love with one side of the question<p>You’re pretty much just going through the motions at that point.  And if, while in that mindset, what you’re reading from the other side are seemingly archaic works, written in a forbidding jargon, presenting arguments and ideas no one defends anymore (or at least no one in the “mainstream”), your understanding is bound to be superficial and inaccurate.&quot;",1445239343

What other CLI password managers did you review, and in what ways did you want Steel to be different?<p>I noticed that, after being opened, the SQLite database appears to be stored on disk unencrypted, and must be manually re-encrypted with the &quot;close&quot; command. I think most password managers attempt to ensure that the unencrypted database is only ever in physical memory.<p>The interface uses pipable commands rather than an interactive shell. The reason given is so that it can integrate with other standard Unix tools. This means that the entry context must be supplied for every command, in this case by id. Another side-effect of the pipable command interface is that using the &quot;replace&quot; command to change the passphrase will echo the passphrase to the screen and leave that passphrase in the shell history.<p>The manual gives an example of piping to another utility:<p><pre><code>  steel --show-passphrase 4 | xclip -selection clipboard\n</code></pre>\nHowever, this seems a bit awkward for such a common task.

But the KJV was a ground-breaking translation at the time: kind of like ALGOL or something like that. Nobody uses it anymore, but its ideas were what everybody has built on. And unlike nearly any modern translation, its English style means that it has rightly become a literary classic on its own rights. Yeah, it&#x27;s not the Bible I read.

You don&#x27;t want passwords in plain-text traveling around pipes or sockets with easy to sniff system-calls. You want a secure channel between your password manager and the application. Keepass2, for example, copies your password to the clipboard and <i>automatically</i> erases the clipboard after a short timeout. (True secure channels don&#x27;t exist yet in any OS as far as I&#x27;m aware.)<p>Upon reading the manual, steel <i>can</i> communicate with X clipboard (by xclip), but it passes the passphrase through a pipe. It never clears the clipboard. To be &quot;secure&quot;, it&#x27;d need to be an X11 application (i.e., NOT command-line) which would participate in the X11 selection protocol and provide password only when the user actually tries to paste it.<p>In addition, you need to &quot;open&quot; and &quot;close&quot; the steel database before using it. The manual does not explain what &quot;opening&quot; and &quot;closing&quot; does however. Does &quot;open&quot; temporarily decrypt the whole database?<p>Security is more than just applying strong crypto.

You can spot JS desktop apps, just by the size of executable, which is at least 5-10 times bigger than you could expect (Spotify - 130MB). They have poorer performance, can drain your battery faster, and some OS native features/guidelines must be implemented in a custom way, or could not be implemented/used at all.

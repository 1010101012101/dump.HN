This happens all the time. It's blackmail but on a tiny scale, but it does have a real, negative impact.<p>Just because an app receives some low ratings it doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad app or the developer is an idiot.

When I was in 7th grade, my English teacher had us read Macbeth, Northwest Passage, The Last of the Mohicans, The Red Badge of Courage, and other notable works. We discussed them in detail and wrote essays ad nauseum. It was hard, but we were the better for it.<p>Last year, in my son's Literature class <i>(note; it's not English anymore - it's Literature)</i>, they read a smattering of short stories from a brightly illustrated textbook and his sole ""book report"" was to make a pop-up book from his chosen novel ""Percy Jackson and The Last Olympian"" (now a major motion picture!). This was typical of many of his classes - plenty of busy work, but thin on substance. His middle school ranks very well by state standards, but it's just not a solid education, in my opinion.<p>This isn't a generational issue, either.

On Linode the ram cost is exactly 25.6 MB/$ no matter the plan you choose.<p>Imagine a service that would let you rent a shared memcached server for, say, 5 dollar to access a (max) 400MB memcached. Each memcached server would be limited to, say, 10 users. You would then have access to potentialy tens of MB from a fast memcached near your existing VPS at Linode.<p>This memcached would be shared: you would need to have unique keys, prefixed, for example, by a unique string.

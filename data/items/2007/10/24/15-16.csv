72097,comment,71967,72065,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I wouldn't judge anything by how many people agree or disagree with it. I would simply acknowledge that a lot of people feel one way or the other.<p>\nWhy not view programmers as customers, and languages as products? Are the customers buying the products that provide them the most value? I believe your argument is that they are not. Then why? Are they dumb? Misled? Controlled by people who don't know any better?<p>\nIt just seems like there is some missed communication going on here. I know I'd like to see somebody who is an expert in both functional programming and some ornery imperative/OO language, like C++, make some observations. By expert, I mean several non-trivial deployed production systems in each language, not somebody who played with language A in college is now infatuated with language B.<p>\nAs for me, I'll pick whatever language makes my startup get to market and adapt to customer's needs the fastest. I hear PG says that's probably one of the functional languages. I'm  game. I can prototype and change a web site very quickly in several other languages (with the right tools), I'm always willing to see if something else will work better. But I can certainly also make the observation that there must be a lot more functional programmers who moved to imperative programming than the other way around. Surely they all can't have done so for the reasons I've outlined above.",1193241361
72096,comment,71967,71967,0,0,geebee,,,"I haven't noticed as much C-bashing.  It always seemed to me that people recognize that C programming is pretty damn hardcore, and that the people who have mastered it are accomplished programmers.  I still see quite a bit of reverence for kernel programmers.  Yeah, there's some C bashing, everything gets bashed.  But Java has taken much more of a beating lately than C.<p>Otherwise, I largely agree with the article (although I don't actually think C particularly needs defending right now).  The only point I disagree with in this article is the exclusion of server-side web applications when he says ""show me the code.""  Server side web apps aren't the dull, stateless things they used to be - trememdous innovation is taking place here.\n",1193241265

They often die slightly younger (more like 3 years rather than the stated 5). Men age more slowly and gracefully (if you have to generalize). Don't believe it? Take a look around you.",1193240776
72093,comment,71967,71967,0,0,mynameishere,,,"C and C++ and Java, etc, were written for practical reasons, and they attract practical followers. When someone writes a blog post about Java, it's rarely to show a ""trick"" or to prove superiority, but rather to solve some problem.<p>If I'm typing away in Java, you KNOW I have an end-goal. No one plays around, because...it's not a toy.<p>It's like saying, French is a more beautiful language than English (it is, you know). But compare the import/export ratio of the film and popular music industries. I can't recall the last French pop song I heard...<p>Wait, I do: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-sUzR71wpQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-sUzR71wpQ</a>",1193240676

Very few free open-source applications are able to generate as much cash as Firefox, and the Mozilla Foundation therefore has a responsibility on behalf of the entire community to manage this fortune.<p>I'm thinking something along the lines of ransoming source code, supporting full-time coders for projects not related to Mozilla, etc. Why aren't people discussing this?",1193240630

72086,comment,71952,72055,0,0,ced,,,"Women could have genes that promote old age so that they can feed and raise their children longer. Children of long-living mothers have a better chance of survival, and thus a selective advantage, all other things being equal.<p>My point is not to prove my personal ""theory"" about women living longer than men. Rather, I contend that there is almost never One True Cause for anything in evolution. All we can do is propose many different competing factors, and say, with a lot of hand-waving, that factor X was the most important in such and such cases. Newspapers often translate that into ""Y happened because of X"", but that's just bad reporting. ",1193239063

1768265,comment,1763618,1767690,0,0,8ren,,,"It's well-known that Oracle isn't a technology company, but one that uses technology. It's not that their engineers are bad in any way, it's just that that's not a focus of the company as an organization. Instead, technology becomes a background issue (or a hygiene factor, as some economists call it.) It has to work, it has to be good; but it's not what makes the company <i>go</i> - they don't depend on Research and Development to produce a stream of new products. Any new tech they get is bought, via acquisition; and it is followed up only if it is of immediate value to their existing customers.  They aren't creating new markets either (though recently they've bought some life sciences companies, which is a big branch out, and might shake up the health care sector in interesting ways.)<p>Of course, once upon a time, they created the very first commercial relational database, before even IBM (where Codd invented it.) But in the following decades, Oracle didn't keep on developing entirely new technologies.<p>Sun, IBM and HP all have or had strong engineering traditions (in particular HP used to, though not so much today.) Other examples with strong engineering are Sony, Nintendo, Adobe, TI, Intel and Apple. Another business company, like Oracle, is SAP. It's not intended as an insult, just a description of a company's approach. IBM has certainly moved much closer to that these days, it's almost a consulting company (like the big accounting firms), and its R&D has become very directed towards their client's immediate needs - at least, that's what they said at a presentation a few years ago.<p>I've read of Mark Reinhold's comments about what's happening with Java now (but not listened to that specific podcast.) He made an interesting point about the JRockit tech (acquired from BEA.) Let me ask you: is it realistic to imagine the new platform architect not saying positive things on this point, given his job and employer? If he thought otherwise, would he be given the job, with its significant Public Relations component (which is what that podcast is, from Oracle's perspective)?<p>In my view, I'm just stating well-known and accepted facts that I think Oracle itself would agree with.

1768231,comment,1759761,1765242,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Obviously our experiences have been different. I'll readily admit that I'm not an expert with ports <i>or</i> apt-get (I've been a Red Hat, Fedora, CentOS user for about 15 years, so I'm deeply familiar with RPM, and know exactly what to expect there), and my entire experience with both has been building our installation script and updates management stuff for both platforms.<p>apt-get mostly just worked for everything I needed it to do. Yes, it has some occasional quirks, specifically when running it via scripts--there are some actions which are pretty much impossible to script. apt-get, for instance, won't replace a package with a different version to satisfy a dependency when run non-interactively, even if the package being replaced is not required by any other packages on the system. So, if you want to replace a package, you have to explicitly remove it first, and then install the replacement. This is weird, but it's not disastrous. I don't consider apt-get as reliable as yum/RPM for a number of reasons that I've discovered along the way, but it's miles above ports/pkg.<p>FreeBSD ports and pkg tools, on the other hand, have some <i>really</i> scary quirks. For example, installing a pkg non-interactively may fail, but return success. Or, it may return failure, but the package actually installed successfully. There had been a bug about it in the FreeBSD tracker about it for a couple of years when I ran into it...I don't know if it's been fixed by now. This was during the 7.0 release cycle. So, our installation verification stuff doesn't work on FreeBSD; we have to just say, ""Installation probably completed OK, but we don't know for sure because the pkg tools don't always return accurate information about installation success or failure.""<p>I've already mentioned the dependency issues I've run into. I can't believe I'm a unique and special flower in this regard, but maybe the dozen package we deal with and the exact options we need are uniquely broken when installing in a non-interactive fashion, and nobody else runs into them, ever. I certainly did. This aspect of supporting FreeBSD alone took a couple of weeks to work out, and the solution has never been to my satisfaction.<p>So, I'm happy to admit that my knowledge of ports is pretty miserable. But, the same can be said of my knowledge of apt-get...and the amount of effort that went into getting our installation script working on Debian vs. FreeBSD was dramatically different. And, the resulting reliability on Debian is dramatically higher than on FreeBSD. And, at the end of it all, the user can run ""apt-get update; apt-get upgrade"" and our packages get updated along with everything else. And, we have a nice UI in the product itself that can query the native package manager to display a list of available updates and such. All nicely integrated and comfortable for people who are already familiar with their OS. No such luck on FreeBSD. It's all different pieces that don't really fit comfortably together. Some are binary pkgs (because the install would take hours otherwise), some are ports, and some are from our own package format.<p>""> Either they'd be running an out of date, and thus insecure, system
You don't always have to update to run secure software. You only have to update when there are security updates.""<p>So as long as no security updates happen, we're golden!<p>""> rpm -V httpd > > This command verifies the installation of httpd. Does what's running on the system match what the package contains? If not, it tells you which files have changed. > > There is no equivalent for ports that I know of, and I'm pretty sure it would be deeply non-trivial to implement such a command because I don't think ports have a manifest or any sort of particular knowledge about what the payload of the package is.
You must not be familiar with pkg_info, or the pkg-plist file that is part of every port for that matter. There's actually probably a few dozen ways to achieve the same thing, including using mtree to verify filesystem integrity.""<p>I found pkg_info during my Trail of FreeBSD Tears, but I don't believe it tells you about the configuration of the installed port, does it? I don't remember exactly what information I needed and couldn't get, as it's been a couple of years since I was banging on it seriously, but I do recall there were details I couldn't get making it difficult to figure out the actual state of the system.<p>But, it's good to know that you can actually verify your packages and their contents. I'm not sure I believe it works as documented, since so few aspects of ports and pkg tools actually do in my experience, but in the absence of evidence to the contrary, let's just say it does. Point conceded.<p>""> Yeah, I find it difficult to believe, too. It's just stupid, but it's true. You can build a pkg and install it, but then there's no way to keep it up to date via native means (except requiring the user to download and install new pkgs over time, which is unacceptable when there are dozens of packages to deal with).
Yeah, yeah . . . like I said, I've never had to look into the use of third-party repositories, so I wouldn't know. I'm beginning to rethink taking your word for it, though, given your demonstrated lack of knowledge of basic ports management tools. In fact, a cursory look at the manpages for some ports management tools suggests that the ability to specify alternate sources for ports and/or packages is provided by these tools. I might look into this more.""<p>If you figure it out, please let me know. I hate our current distribution and installation process on FreeBSD, and having the ability to use native packages with native update mechanisms would be great. I spoke to Colin Percival (created freebsd-update, and long-time FreeBSD developer) about it in the past, and he had no suggestions, beyond the already mentioned options.<p>""> people already understand how to keep their system up to date using yum or apt-get, or whatever. We don't have that ability on FreeBSD.
Have you tried submitting to ports?""<p>Some of the packages are commercial software, and the code is behind user:pass authentication on our servers. We also have to override the Apache and ProFTPd ports, because we need custom options (actually we're just building the port after modifying the configure options), though I believe ports handles this correctly and keeps our chosen build options through upgrades...I hope so, anyway, and I don't think we've gotten any tickets about it, so I guess it does, though our FreeBSD user base is pretty small (a few hundred vs. hundreds of thousands of CentOS installs). It's a pretty non-trivial endeavor. I believe Webmin and Virtualmin GPL, and some of the Virtualmin modules, already have ports. Which is cool, but we do need direct control over things for the commercial software.<p>""> So, if you want to distribute a pile of applications and keep them up to date, you have to build your own update management system.
Even if the foregoing was true, this would not be true. There are gobs of cross-platform options available for software management, including even repurposed version control systems. You do not need to design your own software management system from scratch.""<p>As I mentioned, we've had our own cross-platform package manager built into our software for years. But, it's not native. <i>That's</i> the source of my complaint. I would like for users who are already familiar with the native means of keeping their system up to date can keep our software up to date, as well. I don't want <i>more</i> confusing update options for users to have to figure out. I want less. I want One True Package Manager on the system and I want it to be able to manage and update all the packages. Adding more software to an already large stack is exactly the opposite of what I want to do.<p>yum/rpm makes this trivially easy. apt-get makes it reasonably easy. FreeBSD makes it pretty much impossible as far as I can tell. But, hey, if you get it figured out, I'd be <i>more</i> than happy to be wrong. Supporting FreeBSD has been a pain in my ass for years now, and it'll continue to be so as long as installation is such a mess.<p>The tragedy of all this is that I really like FreeBSD. I think it's a fine OS with good docs and a really smart bunch of users (our FreeBSD users tend to be better educated about their systems than our CentOS users, on average; which makes sense, given that CentOS is the ""standard"" in hosting, and you'd have to go seek out FreeBSD). But, I just have had so much unbelievable pain and confusion and wasted time because of ports that it's rage-inducing.",1286466329

Obviously this is an oversimplification and I have really interesting friends who are on Facebook all the time, but it's still a generic rule none the less and it makes the whole experience more boring.<p>My particular problem with Facebook is that I simply don't get what's going on; who can see what. I mean, which action of mine will be posted on my wall, who will be able to see it, etc. This may not sound very humble but I consider myself a reasonably intelligent person but still with all that brainpower I just can't tell whether my theoretical ex-girlfriend can see the photos of me that my theoretical current girlfriend of mine posted and if she can, how to disable it. I mean, these are everyday trivial problems that average people living a normal life face, this is not just being afraid of the government / snake headed aliens mining your super secret personal data. Do I really want to show my theoretical drunk party photos with my old headmistress from my elementary school? But then how do I share them with my closest friends? The whole thing is just too much hassle so I wouldn't ever bother posting interesting stuff. Which leads to most people (or at least the intelligent ones) only posting boring, ""politically correct"" things that wouldn't offend even their old headmistress. Which leads to boring content.",1286466300

Instability would suggest that it frequently allows for inefficient outcomes. A stock market's prices are determined exactly by buyer demand and seller supply. It corrects itself in the event of freak transactions (like the flash crash) and if it doesn't correct itself, that means the supply and demand have changed and the price of stocks nearly instantly reflect those changes.",1286466289

1768101,comment,1764236,1767305,0,0,DifE-Q,,,"I know many home school children, and the common idea that they are not socially educated, or well adjusted, is a myth. Most home schooled children do not sit at home all day - cordoned away from the world.  They are usually involved in as much, if not more, activities outside of the home as public schooled children.  They have friends in their neighborhoods, and friends they meet in home school groups and their home school activities. As a matter of fact the home schooled children I know are not only generally smarter, and the adults (home schooled) more successful and happier in life, but the kids are far more socially adjusted than the kids that go to public schools.<p>Public schools by in large create social constructs that do not exist in the adult world. The home schooled children can converse and interact in a healthy way with both young and old - instead of their exclusive peer group.<p>I home school my children. Yet we have an active church social life, they take piano, wrestling, archery and numerous other peer group events. Plus, on beautiful fall and spring days - when most public school kids are shut up behind brick walls wasting their time in classes with 30+ children learning all of nothing - my kids are outside riding their bikes, exploring the neighborhood, etc.<p>The other advantage is that if I see other children mistreating my children, or if I see my children mistreating other children (or adults) - I can provide the proper discipline and education in the matter; whereas a teacher wouldn't even think to take the time and deal with the problem. This is not to say I helicopter my children - but I am more aware of issues than a single teacher might that has to keep track of 30 to a 100 or more students at a time and I care more than a teacher would.  And thus we come to why we are having this discussion in the first place. The article was written by a guy who had a teacher that was not really connected to him, and his parents were not aware enough of the problem to notice and do anything about it. And the bully's parents the same...<p>What could have happened with this guy? Had something not turned in his life, he, like many others may have committed suicide and our world would be at a loss for whatever service and good he has thus far rendered.<p>I think the question really should be this: How is it possible that public school education can teach PROPER socialization - when the evidence and or track record is that these schools produce anti-social behavior and dysfunctional children at such a high level?",1286464449

The code was atrocious and you could tell that this developer was in over their head.<p>The worst part about it is that this developer speaks at industry conferences and blogs about the subject matter at hand. All of the developers on the team for this company had very low opinions of the freelancer and the project was put in significant jeopardy by this developers lack of real world qualifications on the subject matter.

When NSF privatized domain registration in 1993, they paid NSI $6M to run it for two years; it couldn't've cost anywhere near that much.  They were supposed to set up a more efficient ordering system (developing it was part of the $6M deal), but didn't.  They couldn't be held to the terms of the deal, though, because the NSF had set it up as a cooperative agreement, rather than a contract, so that they could evade government procurement rules.<p>Here's how bad their early service was.  In 1996, I was considering giving my dad ourlastname.com for Christmas.  I emailed an ISP local to him, to ask if they could host the domain for him.  I then decided it was a bad idea (giving somebody something that takes work); but, before I contacted them again, I got a bill from Network Solutions for the domain name.  (It was misspelled, too, but that was probably the ISP's fault.) I told NSI it was a mistake, that I hadn't authorized it, but they told me I couldn't cancel the registration; only the ISP could do so.

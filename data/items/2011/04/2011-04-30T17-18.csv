2501122,comment,2500082,2500398,7,0,rmrm,,,"its ridiculous to even entertain the ""seperate building where people of color work"".  The Googleplex itself is filled with ""non-Anglos"".<p>Lets all be honest with what we're talking about, and in America what ""people of color"" really means (in most cases, and probably this one). It means black people.  This guy noticed a lot of black people with yellow badges.  The yellow badges had a high percentage of African Americans.  Much higher than in the Googleplex proper (which probably tracks much closer to their % of the US population).  And they (apparently) get less perks.  This pushes all sorts of historical hot buttons in the American psyche.<p>What's left up to us to determine (assuming the veracity of the OP) is WHY this is.  The most logical reason why is that the yellow badge jobs are low paying jobs, and the company that is contracting for these low paying jobs draws heavily from the African American community in the surrounding areas.<p>What is possibly interesting in all of this is the original issue of why low paying jobs potentially are filled by a much higher percentage of blacks than high paying jobs, which unfortunately has very little to do with Google, and a lot more to do with educational opportunities and the breakdown of the family structure in some African American communities, imo, which leads to a skewing of the potential job opportunities from urban American African Americans to be lower paying than anyone would like.",1304186357

But, we can probably agree that it's more enjoyable to focus on writing good CoffeeScript than on writing CoffeeScript which will compile to good Javascript. Regarding the libraries, couldn't the same be said about learning Clojure without knowing Java (something which I think would currently be pretty acceptable)?<p>All I'm getting at is that I'd like to see CS eventually become  a language in its own right rather than an extra tool for JS developers. I think this is completely feasible if we start treating it that way and create the tools and documentation to that end. I think it is a serious improvement over JS and could eventually replace JS for the common programmer.<p>By the way, thanks for all your work, I'll definitely be picking up the book.",1304186096

If that was a superior format then the chaptered linear book format would have died out before this discussion took place.<p>When people talk about the death of a particular genre of books or the publishing industry, I am reminded of books of poetry written by living authors.<p>The poetry book has been dead from a publishing perspective for a number of years. A large portion of single author poetry books are printed as the result of contests, many of which have an entry or 'reading' fee. Great poems are found easily on the internet, and almost no one speaks of poem piracy because the number of words is often quite small.<p>Despite the arrival of poetry book doomsday, it's still easy to stuff a bookcase full of little poetry chapbooks. There are poetry books printed at fine art presses with complex bits of vellum, embossing and debossing. It's even a friendlier industry now that large publishers have all but ignored it.<p>It sucks that it's not so easy to make a job of it anymore. However, lack of a traditional publishing industry is unlikely to kill the technical book.<p>(edit: repetition)",1304185803

Interns (green IDs) and contractors (red IDs) are given what they need to perform their job role, and little more than that. This guy was beginning to look at information he wasn't allowed to, and that should have been fairly clear to him. It's not that there is something to ""hide"", it's that information is limited for temporary employees, and that's just normal information security practice at any company of real size.<p>In regards to the race claim he's fishing for, I think it's rubbish. Regardless of what the make up of the temporary workers at 3.14 are, I see lots of contractors who are non-white (and contractors get access to most perks), lots of full-time employees are Indian and Asian.

Not even the EUR and GBP have ever reached that in my recollection.</i><p>Keep in mind that the exchange rate is a function of several inputs, one of which is the rather arbitrary fact of how much total currency is in circulation.  There are <i>many</i> fewer BTC than USD, EUR, GBP, etc. (about one million times fewer, to be precise).  And conversely, there are many <i>more</i> JPY in circulation, which is part of the reason the yen is much cheaper than the US dollar.<p>That doesn't mean there's not a BTC bubble.  There may very well be.  But you can't do the comparison you just did and expect it to be meaningful.  If the BTC protocol had specified the decimal point one place to the left, BTC would be trading at 0.40 USD right now, not 4.00 USD.  There'd just be 10 times as many.<p>What you have to do is ask how much total wealth the world will want to store in BTC, and then divide that by how many BTC there are.

The question to whether or not to teach cursive isn't top down, based on some ideological desire of some school administrators. No, it's because the teachers and administration are noticing that the students aren't writing in cursive, and it's a waste to be expending class time on improving a skill which will never be utilized when there are more productive uses of that time.<p>I remember in third and fourth grade the teachers kept saying that by the time we reached high school there was an expectation that everyone was proficient in writing cursive, that all our assignments must be written in cursive. That was the last time I've had to write cursive. Sure the plural of anecdote is not evidence but I've yet to encounter a situation where cursive isn't effectively dead.<p>There's no way you can ignore printed script, because nearly all the text that anyone will ever encounter is print-style. Writing in print and learning to read is a pretty obvious combination. Expecting to learn to read one way and write another is unrealistic.<p>I can't imagine the argument that cursive is more _readable_.

XMPP Transports are far and away the best solution for managing presence on multiple protocols, if Google provided reliable transports for AIM, Live, FB etc then, combined with the (absolutely awesome) centralised chat history feature you could definitely win users over (I have set up transports on my Google account anyway using Gajim and hot-chilli.net, and it's brilliant).

2501008,comment,2500082,2500877,4,0,patrickk,,,"Thanks for taking the time to offer a balanced opinion. I find myself largely agreeing with your sentiments.<p>I think there must be a better balance to be struck between the approach taken in Europe (seen as too difficult to fire people, which isn't conducive to a healthy business environment) and to the American approach (you can be fired at-will).<p>I myself like to watch US-based documentaries like Gasland, Food Inc., Inside Job and Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater story. I know these stories are biased, but I'm silently horrified by the sheer extent to which the odds are stacked against the good of the ordinary person in favour of big business. For example, in the film ""Inside Job"" an IMF banker made the extraordinary revelation that a Wall Street banker basically said to him in a meeting: ""Please regulate us. We're too greedy. If you don't regulate us we'll continue to cause markets to blow up because we can't help ourselves."" This was before the bailouts, so the banker was genuinely terrified that the banking system would utterly collapse and that they would lose everything.<p>Also important however, is to ponder on why America is so rich and why America to a large extent drives the global pace of innovation. There are smart, ambitious people there who can get access to capital and raw talent that is unavailable anywhere else in the world. These conditions must have sprung up in America for a reason - the environment was fertile enough for them to take root. By having a thriving, innovative economy, everybody wins. The standard of living improves for everyone. You get to keep your sovereignty by being rich - just look at the PIIGS (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain). They lost economic sovereignty (except for Spain, but it could happen to them too) by being economically weak. (You can also lose political sovereignty if you are poor, as you can't afford all the military hardware to fight off an enemy). I would urge you to read ""The Ascent of Money"" by Niall Ferguson. He makes excellent points as to why money, and innovations like bonds, stock and insurance actually drive countries forward. For example, the riskiness of the Dutch voyages to the far-East in the late 1500s onwards were mitigated against by forming a limited-liability company, where stock could be sold to ordinary investors. If it weren't for this innovation, then the risk of the voyage would have turned people off from financing such a risky prospect. The voyages were highly successful overall and a remarkable new financial innovation was born. I think what you see in America today is a mix of these very good ideas with some very bad ideas too.<p><i>""To answer your question though, I do believe that it is roughly true that pursuing riches makes it harder to be a moral person. It's not impossible but I do believe it is harder. It is my belief that in a majority of cases one's morality and perception of what is right/wrong/acceptable changes for the worse as they acquire more money.</i>""<p>Money certainly seems to change people (can't say first hand because I'm one of those aspiring millionaires!) I think if you have a solid moral compass to begin with, and realise just because you may be wealthier than someone else doesn't make you better or more important than them, then you will be ok. This is probably difficult as you've mentioned. However, look to the likes of Warren Buffett - he's giving nearly all of his fortune to charity. Or Elon Musk, who is using his wealth trying to advance electric vehicles because the incumbents either can't or won't, and to further space exploration also. Or Bill Gates, who after a career being accused or being a bully and a monopolist, seems to be using his wealth and privileged position to try to make the world a better place. So there is cause for optimism for being wealthy doing the right thing.<p><i>""I believe it is true that the love of money is the root of all evil (as a rough approximation).""</i><p>My take is that the <i>blind pursuit</i> of money, to the <i>detriment of other considerations</i>, is the root of (some/all) evil.

There hasn't been much or any union-bashing or pro-big-corporation sentiment on this thread.<p>Rather, I think most of those who have criticized Andrew are responding to his seeming naivete. I say ""seeming"" because I'm skeptical that he didn't see this coming. Would he not have been able to guess that his emails would escalate the situation, rather than defuse it?<p>When you say you're videotaping employees to explore issues of race and class, it <i>sounds</i> like you're doing an expos. That may or may not be your intent, but when you combine race, class, and unauthorized videotaping in your project summary, it kind of pigeonholes you into the expos genre.<p>So Google was worried that Andrew was going to ask leading questions, pull some quotations out of context, tie it all together with pointed narration, and put it on YouTube with a title like ""Race and Class Warfare at Google.""<p>Maybe Google shouldn't have jumped to that conclusion; maybe they should have spent more time with Andrew and ascertained exactly what he was planning before having him fired. Or maybe they should take a more liberal view and declare a universal policy of free speech by employees and contractors. I'm not saying Google acted exactly as I'd have hoped, but it seems to me that they acted predictably, if nothing else. The only thing that surprises me is that Andrew didn't expect this to happen.",1304183219

But what I can't understand is the discrimination that Google is perpetrating against them by denying them the basic human privilege of talking to another human being.<p>As employees Vic Gundotra or Marissa Mayer will be knowing more company secrets than these guys will know in their lifetime. Do they also have a phone number on the back of their badge to call if somebody unknown approaches them? Are they also prevented from talking to other employees so that they don't leak those secrets? Why is Google afraid that only the yellow badges cannot keep the company secrets?  What if their supervisor simply tells them that what they are working on is a company secret. Like almost any other employees why Google thinks they can' keep it a secret? Why do they have to impose this almost draconian measure of human segregation only for them?",1304183089

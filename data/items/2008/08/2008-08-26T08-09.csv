286892,comment,285903,286173,0,0,demallien,,,"Even if it is your own work, if you are attacking a popular problem, and you are an average programmer, you are very likely going to hit upon the same sort of solution as others have already discovered.<p>For example, I'd be willing to bet that there will be a relatively large number of people that would present some sort of implementation of remote procedure calls - it's something that lets you do cool stuff, whilst still being hard core hacker stuff - dynamic code, low-level syntax analysis, memory management, blah blah blah.<p>A while back I did an RPC implementation to allow transparent interfacing between a custom VM I had written, and native C code.  Basically you write the entire app in one big C code blob, but then during compilation you specify that certain modules are going to live in the VM.  I had created some tools used during compilation to handle the creation of proxy objects on both sides of the VM interface, that could talk to each other.  I was really impressed with myself.  Then I discovered that 90% of the solution was simply an implementation of RPC, and that my code was a slightly messier, slightly buggier version of code that had been written many many times before.<p>I think I'd get bored pretty quickly seeing multiple presentations of slightly messy, slightly buggy implementations of already solved problems.  You see, unless you are a genius, or a complete beginner, you will probably end up with a solution that resembles, a <i>lot</i>, solutions already produced by other competent programmers.",1219740985

Especially the area around 16th and mission, which is really dirty and has a lot of crime (from shootings, drug dealing to one of the highest car thefts rates in the city).<p>The Mission is beloved by wannabe hipsters, that think they are cool and feel like ""urban pioneers"" living in a semi-seedy area.<p>Or google engineers, as the shuttles go by there, and the yupified noe valley (which is actually nice and safe).<p>Housing used to be cheap there, but not anymore, especially considering the blighted enviroment.  I love the food in some places, though.  But definitely not an intellectually stimulating area.",1219740816

Cleans up side effects nicely, while still allowing them when needed. Strong support for easy threading. Escape Java's high-ceremony hell without having to quit the job. Highly recommended.",1219739087

This sounds like a pretty accurate description of me (as I'm sure it is for a lot of us).

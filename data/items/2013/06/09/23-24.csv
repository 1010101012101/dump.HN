With Facebook and Google tracking everything you do, whether you are logged in or not, I would go one step further, and say all of these things are directly attributable to you personally.<p>I would strongly urge young people to really think about what they are putting out there. Consider this, the military was doing the equivalent of credit checks for sensitive positions during the 60s. No one else typically had to have credit checks back then. [Today...] you need a credit check to do ANYTHING, even things that don&#x27;t require credit. How long before an internet and phone background check is standard in the background checks organizations do before offering jobs? [Saying that it won&#x27;t happen is naive.]<p>I can tell you the military is doing this sort of screening right now for sensitive positions, but at least you are confronted about it. It still basically ends your career, but they will give you a chance to explain your posts. In the private sector in the future, they will just deep six your application and you won&#x27;t know what happened. Or they&#x27;ll let you in at entry level, maybe, and subsequently you&#x27;ll start running up against an invisible barrier as you try to advance beyond the first or second layer of management. Or you will find resistance to you advancing into management at all.<p>Also be mindful, it can affect more than your professional life. Think about what the background [and credit] checks for apartments will look like in the 2020s. Or what &#x27;dating sites&#x27; will be like in the 2020s [perhaps with Google Glass]...&quot;<p>----<p>That comment was made in a thread on trolling... but the principle is apropos here as well. Back in the 60&#x27;s credit and background checks were not commonplace because only security agencies had incentive enough run that information down and collate it for a given person. Security Agencies like... say... National ones. Eventually the process was smoothed out so much that today even a rinky dink property manager in Rochester MN, or Santa Clara CA can run that information down. So they do! Whenever you want to rent an apartment. And employers do as well... whenever you want to get a job. etc. etc.<p>Now think about that in the context of a theoretical &quot;internet and mobile phone profile check&quot;.<p>For an apartment?<p>For a job?<p>For a date?<p>For a lawsuit? or for a divorce?<p>or even...<p>Just for the hell of it! Why not? I never liked that lady anyway.<p>So people ask... what are the implications?<p>Well... consider &quot;scope creep&quot;.<p>With information of this nature... the number of methods to command your conformity that the government and military can dream up is legion.",1370822032

The NSA does not, by default accept, a clearance that you received elsewhere. The biggest cost to getting a clearance is time, energy and risk. The easiest path to a respectable TS/SCI is to join a TLA, pass all your background checks, pass all your lie detector tests, work there for a few years making sure not to do anything that could get your clearance taken away and then switch to the private sector. During that time you work at TLA you get moved to a project that uses technology that has little to no value in the private sector making it more difficult to make the switch.<p>Disclaimer: I know this stuff from reading books and informal chats with people at tech companies, please apply salt to taste.",1370821862

Feynman says that he first works out 12, then 12.002, then the man with the abacus says &quot;12.01!&quot;. He asks for more digits.<p>What is sneaky here is that 12.002 is a very rough approximation that Feynman is making before doing a long division. He has the formula of<p><pre><code>    12 * (1 + 1.03/1728)^(1/3)\n    ~= 12 * (1 + (1/3) * 1.03/1728)\n</code></pre>\nBut he simply hasn&#x27;t had the time to do the long division yet and has just approximated 1.03 / 1728 by 1/2000. At this point he has the formula, and quite possibly even knows that the error goes like - 12 x^2 / 9 which would be something like one part in a million, but he wants to do his long division to get the extra decimals to show off.<p>There&#x27;s actually a slightly more slick way to get to this where you start from 12 and compute:<p><pre><code>    (2/3) * guess + (1/3) * number / guess^2.\n</code></pre>\nThe 1/3 and 2/3 are chosen to minimize the error, and you wouldn&#x27;t know this if you&#x27;ve never worked it out. (I only worked it out because I would occasionally be stuck without a calculator on exam problems.)<p>It works really well on these sorts of problems; you compute 1729.03 / 144 and aside from the leading 12 you get:<p><pre><code>    0.0071527777...\n</code></pre>\nYou divide this fraction by 3 to get:<p><pre><code>    0.002384259259...\n</code></pre>\nwhich is precisely as far as Feynman got, but the reasoning is much quicker.

The visual refresh for iOS will make it feel modern and present a new design language for developers, ribbon, leather and wood textures are eradicated, however no fundamental changes such as widgets. There will be some relenting in the iron-fisted control of default apps, but only a couple of apps will be allowed (Browser and Mail).<p>OSX. OSX gets similar but smaller visual update, and yet more iOS features which are not welcomed by power users (more posts about switching from Mac to Linux will ensue[1]).<p>Finder. iCloud will be integrated directly into Finder somehow, such that if signed into iCloud the default start place in Finder will be iCloud documents/images which can be viewed on the Mac, along with their associated sandboxed applications. If you do not have the app installed required to open the document you will be shown a link to purchase the app in the App Store. They will also finally relent to power user demands and allow tabs in the Finder via preferences.<p>The menu bar will be inverted to pure black with white text/icons and no drop shadow. Although the &#x27;z-index&#x27; will still be present it will feel flat aesthetically which will fit more with the new design language.<p>There will be yet more annoying animation with window open/closing, modals etc, and of course no way to turn it off. Core 2 Duo and lower will no longer be supported.<p>Some sort of Mac Pro similar to the G4 Cube with modular add-ons will be announced and will be ridiculously expensive.<p>Finally Apple TV possible update to include an app store and have new hardware (possibly $149).

To put it bluntly, this new government sucked and was useless.<p>A convention was held to suggest improvements for the Articles; they decided instead to do it over again and propose a government that could actually stand the test of time.<p>The framers of this new Constitution then had to convince the rest of the country to adopt this different form of government. In the process of this debate and feedback it was decided to further specify Amendments that became known as the Bill of Rights to satisfy some reluctant states.<p>All of this happened <i>peacefully</i>.<p>The United States of America peacefully transitioned to its second form of government on March 4, 1789.<p>It hasn&#x27;t been all peaceful, all the time, after ratification, but it should be in my opinion. We&#x27;ve managed to achieve so much as a nation with non-violent resistance and protest, there&#x27;s no reason not to do that here to push for transparency.",1370818932

I did see in the Wikipedia article that there is a divid on its usage in British practice.<p>The downvotes on my original comment is interesting. I&#x27;m certain that a writer would like talk of his craft after his demise, just like programmers would like to see comments about if he used ternary operators, why/why not.",1370818880

There are various library hijacking solutions to make it easier. ptrace, that strace uses is necessarily slow (ktrace in eg NetBSD is much faster, the kernel does the tracing not userspace).",1370818852

Educate people. nothing else.</i><p>Your teachers must have omitted teaching you about the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War protests. And those are only two examples where protesting and rioting actually made a huge difference.",1370818842

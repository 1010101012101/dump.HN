You or anyone reading this can be an admin.<p>And you're right, economics is much too complicated for me to easily win such an argument. In a nutshell, my argument is that libertarianism is great, but if we're talking about idealized utoponian economies, I'd like one that was completely free except for government provided health care, schools, fire protection, police, recreational facilities, water, 2000 calories a day, basic shelter, clothing, vocational training, and puppies. A 20% sales tax should be enough to cover it. Also, in such an idealized economic society, the government provides seed stage capital/services for companies and ends up owning minority shares in otherwise public or private companies.<p>In other words, I love freedom, but I'm very willing to pay a fair, flat tax to provide a basic standard of living such that no one is sleeping on the streets, unless they really want to be.",1209812064
180200,comment,179755,180184,0,0,cturner,,,"> I can easily beat mises.org economists in argument.<p>I strongly doubt this.<p>The reason the issue is toxic is that the foundation of an austrian tends to be based on liberty, whereas the foundation of someone else's ideas might be collectivist in nature (e.g. supplying equality of opportunity to all). Of course the people are going to be unable to have a reasonable argument - they're working towards completely incompatible outcomes.<p>> I've never seen a forum with mises.org economists\n> where you could have a full on disagreement without\n> descending into trolling<p>When you are somebody with a scepticism of big government and high regard for personal liberty, it can be frustrating because these ideas are outside the norm and you won't be able to explore them in the course of day to day contact with people who don't think past the front page of the local tabloid. Then one day you pick up a book by Hayek or Mises, and find that they have found very strong and compelling ways to tie together the vague ideas you had previously. This experience can be very compelling.<p>You find that it gives you powerful tools that allow you to analyse public policy positions very quickly.<p>Once you're through that, you can then move on to Popper and start to realise that even though his conclusions are similar, he's attacking some of what's said at a very low-level in philosophy. And this gives you powerful tools to analyse arguments very quickly.<p>I anticipate you are someone with an interest in both coding and essays, and therefore expect that you may appreciate what that would feel like even if you disagree with the actual position. I'd expect that some of the postings that you describe as trolls are motivated by that feeling.<p>The best way to do economics is to have an area where there's room for people to make themselves more stupid (digs and reddits), and then have highly moderated separate sites for people who are interested in learning more about a tradition and where they can talk about it without constantly being pulled off line by people with incompatible value systems.<p>If you have any further comments to discuss about this in response to my post, I'd appreciate if you'd instead email me directly at craig@cowoh.org because I don't want to discus further in this forum.

Rails is not very efficient when it comes to resources. I have re-implemented Ruby/Rails code that runs faster and in 3 times less hardware on Java. Closer to the metal. Better usage of OS services.",1209811261

And I'm not going to start using them, because I use Google via the Firefox toolbar.<p>Still, if hundreds of thousands of people were to switch to this search engine, in addition to being very profitable for Echocho, it would be a net gain for the environment over people using regular Yahoo. I doubt they can manage to fully cover the externalities of their existence, but it seems better to plant trees than to not  plant trees.<p>Is TheHungerSite still around?

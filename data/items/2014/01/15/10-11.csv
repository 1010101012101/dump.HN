7062532,comment,7060951,7062384,4,0,Kutta,,,"The main purpose of Rust is to be a practical, safe alternative to C++. Go and D are NOT such languages, because of the mandatory garbage collection. From time to time there&#x27;s been efforts to replace C++ with safer garbage collected languages such as Java or C#, and every time it basically failed. Direct control over memory has been proven pretty much essential in high-performance software. Thus, we&#x27;re still stuck with C++, and we&#x27;re still suffering for it, having nightmarish bugs and myriads of security holes and whatnot.<p>Rust at least tries to make an honest effort to change that. If and when it gets really fleshed out it&#x27;d be a boon to all those poor developers. And please forget your awfully subjective qualms about syntax (seriously, go and program in Haskell if you&#x27;re all for pretty syntactic and cohesiveness - though I can&#x27;t guarantee you won&#x27;t find it &quot;disgusting&quot;). Memory management in the C++ way is bloody hard, and it&#x27;s a dirty affair. It makes no sense to be repulsed by all the complexity there, because it&#x27;s unavoidable, and it&#x27;s a job that has to be done. Of course there&#x27;s going to be a smattering of syntactical constructs to make memory management less tedious, just like there is extra syntactic baggage on bigger Haskell programs to accommodate the fine control over side effects.<p>Having a <i>memory safe</i> high-performance language with C++-like memory management is a HUGE thing. A while ago I would have dismissed such a thing as a pipe dream, and when I became convinced that Rust could work it was a moment of great rejoicing. Even if Rust ends up on the dumps, there has been at least an effort, and maybe someone will make a better Rust some day.<p>So please try to understand the purpose and rationale behind Rust before dismissing it in a superficial way.",1389781077

I would like to use Go, yes, and I do when I have a chance.<p>Go is a fully garbage collected language that doesn&#x27;t offer a lot of support for manual memory management (and that isn&#x27;t intended to attack Go—it just wasn&#x27;t one of its goals). Rust is a low-level systems language that allows full control via zero-cost abstractions, but is safe. Achieving that goal requires some new machinery and syntax. Systems programming often entails writing for environments in which you can&#x27;t use a GC (or even any runtime at all) for performance or other reasons.<p>> Also your point about syntax vs safety and correctness makes no sense, since it implies that those are mutually exclusive so I&#x27;m just going to ignore that one.<p>Rust has a unique feature—manual memory management with safety—so it needs syntax for it. It&#x27;s not just syntax for its own sake—it&#x27;s what gives the language a niche all its own.",1389780909

I might be wrong, but I would very much make that suggestion.<p>My problem ultimately, as a Brit, is that it seems that we are more and more becoming a satellite of the US, bound by US law and ideals we never ever voted for. We had a referendum on the EU, but never a referendum for all this. But of course that is a British matter and not something the US should be concerned with. If we Brits want to suck up to the US, why would the US turn it down?<p>I think that what has happened is a nasty mission creep with regard to intelligence. Its used to be all about threats to a given country. The basic point was to understand the intentions of one&#x27;s enemies. This was and is vital in preventing mistaken action based on not knowing that an enemy has no plan to, say, invade, or what ever. It was based on the idea that knowledge helps prevent paranoia and fear. All of which is not just OK, but vital. It is why in the cold war, both sides accepted this in a gentlemanly way. Both knew it was vital to both to stop both nuking each other. If the USSR said it would not start a war, the West could verify that by spying and have confidence. And vice versa. Now it seems that a lot of it is about gaining advantage in commerce, and local law enforcement. Its fine to say that the NSA has nothing to do with this, but we know that they give access to the FBI and police. We can reasonably believe that its quite possible that the NSA also gives intelligence to large businesses like Lockheed. What has happened is that economic and local criminal issues are now redefined as matters of national security. The lines have not just blurred, but completely crossed over, perhaps gone completely.<p>As a result, I think we need to re-examine the role and scope of intelligence gathering. Spying needs credibility. And yes, there is a severe danger of throwing out babies in the bathwater. But ultimately, if the people lose confidence in intelligence gathering, we are in a whole lot of trouble. It is vital to get the balance right.",1389780120

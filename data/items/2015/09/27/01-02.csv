The NSA knew about that attack, and maybe the Soviets knew too, but the public didn&#x27;t.<p>(b) The key length for DES however is entirely a computing power issue; it is not a knowledge issue. It would be obvious to everyone even in 1977 that a 64-bit key as originally proposed would have been better than the 56 bits they ended up using[1]. Furthermore, everyone understood how to do a brute force attack, but it just wasn&#x27;t feasible for the public. Only the NSA would have had the budget and inclination to develop special-purpose computing hardware to actually do it in the 1980&#x27;s DES era.<p>[1]I have to mention one nitpick here, otherwise someone else will point it out. The 56-bit key length was supposedly ideal because DES would have been more easily cracked using differential cryptanalysis than brute force with any key longer than 56 bits. Thus the NSA can claim, &quot;no we didn&#x27;t weaken DES by shortening the key, we optimized it because 64 bits doesn&#x27;t buy you extra security over 56 bits&quot;. But that argument is bogus. They could have improved DES in such a way that it used 64-bit keys <i>and</i> wasn&#x27;t vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis. But they did the latter and not the former, because it keeps DES secure against the Soviets (assuming they knew about differential cryptanalysis) and against the public (who can&#x27;t mount a brute force attack) but does allow the NSA to be able crack it.",1443318868

10285102,comment,10284587,10284587,0,0,tomohawk,,,"Most of the squeezing seems to come down to cronyism, which is a problem in just about any system.  For example, the government pushing of subprime mortgages (at the urging of cronies) over-inflated housing prices, and then when the balloon burst, the cronies won again by having the government take over their debt.  The question should primarily be how to restrain cronyism, and thereby provide the best outcome for the most people.  Cronyism seeks to restrain trade in a way that is advantageous to only a few politically connected players.<p>A pure socialist system or a pure capitalist system would probably not have these issues, but then these are both unicorns.<p>Cronyism seems to be the primary way a socialist system operates.  If you&#x27;re politically connected, you tend to get best access to the goods and tend to be able use regulations to handicap competitors.  This makes sense as in a socialist system, the people running the government are more actively engaged in the economy, and the tendency to reward friends and punish adversaries is hard to fight.<p>In a capitalist system, cronyism can also occur if players collude or if a player obtains a monopoly (or some other type of controlling position).  In either case, the system then becomes distorted as players increasingly use coercion instead of mutually beneficial exchange.  For example, Apple colluding to keep down the wages of workers.",1443318401

The word regressive is used to describe the incidence of a tax on a population.</i><p>Although this is effectively the definition of <i>progressive</i> and <i>regressive</i> taxation today—because that&#x27;s how the terms are almost always used by the large number of people who have only the most casual understanding of tax policy—it is a perversion of the original and long-standing textbook definition, and of the way in which the terms are still used by some economists.<p>By the original definition, a progressive tax is simply one whose rate of assessment increases (&quot;progresses&quot;) with the value subject to taxation [0]. Thus an import duty on bananas is progressive if it taxes them at a rate of 1% ad valorem for the first $1MM&#x27;s worth, and then at a rate of 2% of their value above $1MM.<p>Note that the original definition and the popular corruption coincide when the thing being taxed is a person&#x27;s income. (Together with the mistaken association with &quot;progressive&quot; politics, this seems to be the source of the perversion of meaning.) But the two definitions often differ, and the term &quot;progressive&quot; in the context of taxation originally had nothing to do with how the burden of taxation is distributed across society.<p>0.

10285095,comment,10284202,10284531,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I was watching a TV programme on haiku the other day.  One of the things they stressed was that because haiku is so compressed (17 mora in Japanese, where a mora can be though of as either a vowel sound or a consonant followed by a vowel sound in English terms) that you have to be careful of what grammar constructs to use.  Grammar does not usually lead to imagery and if you can strip away the grammar, you can have more mora to use for words that evoke imagery.<p>This made me think that haiku, in particular, is good at evoking emotions and imagery that the reader/listener is already familiar with.  There are some incredibly powerful haiku that in just a few words can really tug at your emotions.  But you need to have already experienced the imagery for it to have any meaning.<p>I find that picture to be similar in nature to a haiku.  There is very little in the picture itself, but the elements it has evoke powerful emotions because we know what they mean.  The starving child, the vulture sitting ready, the question of &quot;why is the child starving&quot; (war)...  You assemble these ideas in your head and it generates a huge number of thought processes and feelings.<p>To me, the difference between such a picture and a haiku is that the picture is not something I have ever seen before.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine it without seeing it first.  Someone could write the most poignant haiku about that image, but it would mean nothing to me, who has never seen such a war.  But, to the people of that village, I&#x27;m sure such a haiku would be incredibly powerful -- possibly even more so than the photograph.  They would fill in their own experience in the gaps left by the words.  For someone personally familiar with the experience, the photograph might be too real and obvious -- even gauche.<p>I wonder if text is an ideal mechanism for discussing topics for which the the audience already has some experience -- something to relate to and hang on those words.  Pictures, on the other hand, are good for describing things that people have not seen before and may not relate to.",1443317962

It&#x27;s a much more subtle and precise and pleasant vibration than on my current device (iPhone 6) on the new 6s but it&#x27;s not really a big change. No quantum leap.<p>(Can I just say that I really hate people who dislike that metaphor? A quantum leap is a discontinuous and surprising change, not necessarily a massive one. It&#x27;s more appropriate to describe a qualitative difference, not a quantitative one. As such it doesn&#x27;t really matter that in reality a quantum leap is a tiny distance, what matters is that it&#x27;s discontinuous, with no steps in between. That&#x27;s what the metaphor is playing at. Something that seems familiar weirdly ends up in a suprising place it has no right to be. Not without being somewhere else in between first.)<p>On the MacBooks that same technology most certainly is a quantum leap: on the trackpads it actually feels like clicking down a physical button. On the phones that same sensation is not created. Not at all, not even a little tiny bit.<p>My hypothesis is that with the trackpad your only point of contact with a vibrating surface is the tip of your finger. With the phones you feel the whole device vibrating in your hand. That should make it harder to fool your brain into thinking you are holding anything but a vibrating device. I will have to lay the new iPhones flat on a table and test it out when I get the opportunity, maybe they would feel differently. (But even if they could create that feeling while flat on the table iPhones are probably set up differently than MacBook trackpads and more tuned to just create a pleasant vibration, since that&#x27;s all they normally can do in your hand.)<p>All that said, yeah, real tactile feedback, if it can be pulled of convincingly, provides some neat perspectives for touch interfaces.",1443316623

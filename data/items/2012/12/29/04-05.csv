I don't think people understand just how dismal such places are. And yet, geographic prejudice abounds, people say things about ""ignorant hicks"" that they would never say about a class based on race or gender.<p>> ""as a group white men are doing much better in that regard than others.""<p>Whites do worse in America in a host of ways compared to Asians, such as educational attainment, average income, criminality, and etc. For almost every documented white/black achievement gap, there is a corresponding asian/white achievement gap.<p>As far as gender goes, males earn fewer college degrees than women do. I expect this will cause the earnings gap to reverse in the long run. It already has in urban areas.<p>Whites are the majority race in America and men have traditionally been in charge of things. But to truly look at privilege, you have to look at the present, not the past. Academic concepts of privilege are rooted in the 1960s and they don't fit well with the modern world.<p>I hope you get to read this comment, my last account I used in race/gender discussions was hell-banned.

4981172,comment,4979694,4980813,3,0,vrv,,,"The degenerate/extreme/unrealistic case of Incast is you have switch buffer capacity to store N segments, you talk to M servers that each return one segment, and M >> N.  Although RTO is calculated based on RTT and RTTVAR, in the extreme case you can get clumps (and waves) of retransmissions (depending on the properties of the network) such that even eliminating the minRTO altogether may not solve the problem at some scale. In simulation we experimented with adding an adaptive staggering to the exponential backoff algorithm and found that it helped at high server counts [1], but it was only simulation so I'd take that approach with a grain of salt.<p>The R2D2 work is pretty neat: different than a lot of other approaches I've seen.  I'm excited to see how the FPGA implemention works!<p>Some comments: 1) I think any significant change to the control algorithm requires careful analysis: the variance in throughput with the multi-client experiment looks interesting, though I don't know whether that is steady state.  From the graphs, R2D2 suffers more with larger filesizes whereas TCP actually improves. 2) Real datacenters can have very different traffic patterns that can break some of the assumptions about bandwidth uniformity and latency, though it's harder for academics to tackle that.  3) If you are going down the path of TCP offload, you presumably can avoid the overhead of CPU interrupts/timer programming when reducing the RTO into microseconds :).  I'd be interested in seeing how R2D2's algorithms/constants work when you're able to reduce the 3ms timer to microseconds in hardware!<p>Also, if some kernel programmer wants to fix my once-working patch to support microsecond-granularity TCP retransmissions [2], I personally know a bunch of people who would be happy :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://vijay.vasu.org/static/papers/sigcomm147-vasudevan.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vijay.vasu.org/static/papers/sigcomm147-vasudevan.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/vrv/linux-microsecondrto"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/vrv/linux-microsecondrto</a>",1356756574

My sole point with that statement, as you can see in the following sentence, is that the author seemed to be suggesting that sexism was behind most of what happened to her, rather than just saying that sexism was an issue, along with other things that could have happened to her even if she were a man.<p><i>> She experienced all of this in FOUR months time. Judging by that timeline, I find it highly unlikely that one could so easily chalk it all up to being in the wrong, other people knowing what they're saying/doing, and still have all those other experiences.</i><p>Why not? She was the common factor in all these occurrences, not the other parties. It would be much more unlikely that a series of 3rd parties ALL chose to attack her because of her gender.<p><i>> I think this was a case of a bunch of men who didn't know how to be led by a woman who came up with a really badass idea.</i><p>That's a statement completely lacking proof. Whoever said she came up with this idea on her own? In fact, she said herself in the blog post:<p><i>> Cryptoparty was created one very boring evening, in a very open and inclusive conversation on Twitter, a little over four months ago.</i><p>And being ""led"" by a woman? Again, she said herself:<p><i>> Decentralised, DIY, psuedo-leadership.</i><p>So she wasn't ""leading"" the men. Again, your statement conflicts with the author's own statements.<p><i>> Reading this after the article seems as if you missed quite a few of her disclaimers. For example, she admits repeatedly that she is neither as knowledgeable or experienced in a number of technical areas</i><p>And reading this seems as if you missed the point I was trying to make. I'm not saying that the others were in the right by criticizing her or putting her down. I'm just saying that it might have more to do with her lack of experience than her being a single mother. After all, I can imagine if that if any other random newbie were to enter the community and start throwing around his weight, things wouldn't be received too well either, even if that newbie were right. And I'm also not saying that such a situation should exist - it shouldn't. But it has nothing to do with sexism.<p><i>> Let's call her the non-technical founder, shall we? It's a term everyone on HN seems to understand and, usually, respect.</i><p>No, we shall not. Cryptoparty, as a community project with ""pseudo-leadership"" is not at all comparable to the tightly controlled, profit-oriented, founder-driven environment of a startup.<p><i>> That's effectively three strikes against her in the tech world, as far as I can see.</i><p>All I can do here is quote <i>you</i>, from earlier in the very same post by you:<p><i>> This is perhaps the most cunningly dangerous thing you could allow yourself as a response. In the case of any kind of discrimination or behavior that is experienced by someone else, please start working to taboo your acceptance of and reliance on ""how you see it"".</i><p>Really? You just violated your own taboo.<p>Have you ever stopped to think that your personal experiences might not be applicable to all other single fathers, because anecdotal data isn't all that useful? Have you ever stopped to think that raising a child is a serious task that requires a significant amount of time, much of it unplanned, and that many jobs/projects may simply not be able to accommodate that for logistical reasons?<p><i>> Did you actually read (and maybe re-read) the opening where she states quite plainly that she is not chalking everything up to sexism? ""Some parts of this article deal with misogyny, sexism, and harassment, while other aspects of it respond to experiences of down-right douche-baggery.""</i><p>Again, did you actually read (and maybe re-read) my initial post? My point was that <i>despite</i> her statement that it wasn't all about sexism, that seemed to be a common thread in the whole post. Following the bit about the poor Cryptoparty decisions that you mentioned, she says that she ""got emails telling me to stick to motherhood and tweeting.""<p><i>> But even that doesn't matter. She's the founder. She busted her ass to organize the whole thing.</i><p><i>> She came up with and organized the idea of the CryptoParty</i><p>Once again, she said that there was only ""pseudo-leadership"" and the project developed on Twitter during an open conversation. You seem to have conveniently ignored that part of the post.<p><i>> Moreover, there are things that are said that seem to me would not so frequently have occurred had the organizer been a man. If the organizer had been a man, technical or not, the tone of disagreements would have been very different.</i><p>Again, you're just assuming things here. As you said yourself, ""connotation is a deceptive thing that, when focused on, makes one think s/he is successfully spotting discriminatory, sexist, racist, what-have-you acts.<p><i>> Nobody would tell a male founder that he wasn't being ""level-headed"", or tell him to quit, or call him emotional, or anything else that frequently is launched against women. I've seen men in screaming matches over ideas, passionately and intensely convinced they're right, shouting obscenities and hurling personal attacks that have nothing to do with the issue, and nobody ever busts in and calls them a bunch of emotional basketcases who aren't level-headed enough to lead or make decisions. And yet women don't have such privilege and protection.</i><p>Once again, you're generalizing your personal experiences. If anything, I've seen women get treated quite nicely/equally by the vast majority of men in the industry. The problem, as someone else put it, is that when only 0.5% of the participants are women, it only takes 1% of the men harassing them to make life difficult for them.<p><i>> As far as I can read, this is one hell of an account of how not to treat your non-technical founder/co-founder/teammate. It's just reprehensible and wrong.</i><p>I'm not condoning any of the things that happened to her. If it really is as she says (usually the other side has a very different tale to tell), then she was treated quite poorly, regardless of her gender or children.<p><i>> I can't see anyone from those communities acting in such a way as to throw shit in those guys' faces while they're trying to turn that talk into a panel that allows other applicants to take part with them or whatever</i><p>Have you stopped to consider how that man from Sydney who had already applied for the speaking spot felt when some newbie comes along and says she wants to turn the speech into a panel? A speech and a panel are two completely different things, and serve different purposes.<p>The conference had previously decided there would be a speech, and the other applicant was under no obligation to agree to participate in a panel.<p>Besides, if this woman is as great as you're making her out to be, why didn't she just apply for the speaker spot? Surely she would have been selected over the other applicant, given her achievements.<p><i>> Moreover, that image of the Creeper Cards is just disgusting.</i><p>Yes, this shouldn't have happened. Unfortunately, it only takes one or two people for that sort of thing to happen.",1356756437

4981164,comment,4980700,4980700,10,0,rcoh,,,"While Lock-free code gets you part of the way to efficient parallelism (by removing suspension-induced dead time) as he mentions, the performance impact caused by repeated cache line invalidation can be a significantly bigger problem.<p>In many modern processor architectures (x86, for example), a cache-coherence protocol is used to ensure that cache lines provide data according to the memory discipline. On x86, that discipline is Total Store Ordering. (See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_ordering"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_ordering</a>).<p>This means that if two processors are contending for the same value (eg. trying to increment it, set it to true, or even read it), they will force the CPU to invalidate the cache line containing the value on all the other cores, leading to massive scalability bottlenecks. If multiple cores are contending for the same location in memory, whether it's lock free or not, performance will suffer.<p>More deviously is the case of false sharing, where 2 different values just happen to fall on the same cache line. Even though they don't conflict, the processor must still invalidate the line on every core. Modern compilers do their best to prevent this, but sometimes they need a little help.<p>The takeaway is this: Don't try to implement your own locks using CAS -- even something as simple as a lock is very hard to get right (performance-wise) when scaling to dozens and hundreds of cores / threads. People have solved this problem (people.csail.mit.edu/mareko/spaa09-scalablerwlocks.pdf). Writing fast concurrent code (especially lock-free code) is a minefield of weird architecture gotchas.

One is in South Carolina near Hilton Head (I bought it when I was single) and the other four are condos around San Diego, CA.<p>We bought in when the housing market was at its low.  The credit markets were crap so we had to buy all of them cash except the one we live in now which was a bit more expensive.  After expenses (HOA and property management) our average returns are about $900/mo. ($10,800/yr.) for every $100,000 invested.  That's not too bad considering housing prices and rental rates will continue to climb over time (or that's the plan at least).  We're fortunate enough to live frugally and just happened to have the money lying around when the housing market sucked so we bought a couple homes a year over the past few years.<p>For the house in South Carolina we're losing about $200/mo., but it's a 15yr mortgage.  We'd be making a bit if it were a 30yr.  I bought that one when I saw 21 so I didn't know anything about anything.  Some would say I still don't.<p>The real estate is nice because the extent of my involvement is manually paying real estate taxes on the homes without mortgages, answering a couple emails a year about high dollar ($200+) repairs or signing new lease agreements.<p>As one of the other posters mentioned, we also invest in Lending Club.  Our investment was more just play money to see how things worked, but returns so far have been surprisingly good, around 14% annually.  I like it because it's so diversified with only $25/loan.  You can maximize returns by picking better loans.<p>The passive income is nice because it'll allow me to quit my job next year and work on my startup full-time.  I want to apply to Y Combinator and even if I don't get accepted I'd be able to bootstrap my startup indefinitely with our passive income.  Hopefully it doesn't come to that, but if it does maybe I'll pivot around year 25 (year 50 at the latest).",1356755255

First you have plain composition of non-container Functor types.<p>Then you have the Applicative/Monoidal functors (they're equivalent/isomorphic) which are probably most clearly demonstrated by the Monoidal class--it implements composition of Functors which maps to products in the contained types (or, has a ""applicative"" product which commutes with the functor)!<p>Then you have Monadic functor composition where you have ""sequential"" or ""inward"" composition via join (compare to Applicative's ""horizontal"" product composition) which can be implemented by the 'bind' function which maps a function that rewraps contained values.<p>Finally you have the Arrow types which add composition to Profunctors (which are like functors which contain both ""incoming"" and ""outgoing"" values) by composing them like a category.<p>---<p>Which is a lot of words to say that (1) Monads are just one of a whole group of ""kinds"" of composition and (2) they basically represent composition which allows for control over how functorial contexts get sequenced.",1356755159

They (and I) could do better at filtering, and some tracking services are better than others, but it's one of those infinite time sinks that has generally not paid off beyond where I am now.<p>While great in theory, I haven't yet found a single bug tracker that provides reasonable deduplication that doesn't e.g. cause a new issue when the SLOC generating the error changes, just because you added a method to the class.  Even allowing me to group two apparently-distinct bugs together manually would be an improvement, both for tracking history and severity, but I haven't found any.  They're all too aggressive at grouping X, Y, and Z when they shouldn't, and make 20 piles of A.  They are infinitely better than receiving an email for every single one, but still a headache, and they still generate too many false alarms to hook directly up to automated systems.<p>Then there's also that outright <i>failures</i> that need to immediately be fixed, and semi-unexpected things like insane responses from Facebook, are all useful to track.  <i>Unexpected</i> rises in relatively normal Facebook errors can denote problems on either end, possibly fixable in some situations, while seeing a jump in quantity might imply something.  If you don't track them continuously, you don't even know if it changes, so 'fixing' / suppressing them completely is hamstringing yourself.  So ideally whatever I use would track fix-this-now and investigate-if-it-changes.  I haven't found any that do.<p>Not that I've looked at too many, much less subjected them to large-enough workloads to be sure they're actually an improvement.

Monadic methods let you ""lift"" functions, so they don't have to be coupled:<p><pre><code>    // bad: unnecessarily coupling your function to a monad\n    IEnumerable<int> Increment(IEnumerable<int> sequence) {\n        var r = new List<int>();\n        foreach (var e in sequence) r.Add(e + 1);\n        return r;\n    }\n    ...\n    var incrementedList = Increment(list);\n\n    // good: using monad method to lift a non-coupled function\n    int Increment(int b) { return b + 1; }\n    var incrementedList = list.Map(Increment);</code></pre>",1356754722

You raise some very valid points that we actually went back and forth on a bit during the design process.<p>1) Regarding the inline popups, the overall goal was to educate first time users on how the site works (that ReelSurfer lets you cut highlights out of any video on the web). I agree that they are a little obtrusive though. Are you more opposed to the contents/frequency of those particular popups, vs popups in general, or both? We considered some other options like a help button or progressive UI disclosure - do you have a preferred means of surfacing this kind of info? Hopefully a small consolation now is that once dismissed, you should no longer see the popups on your next visit.<p>2) Regarding original URLs, that is a great idea. Currently there is one way to get to the original video - the ""See More"" button that displays on hover will take you to the original video's page (in this case, YouTube). We'll try to make it a little more prominent, or perhaps even add a link to the metadata below the player.<p>3) Regarding the branding strip for embeds, totally makes sense and you hit the nail on the head about wanting to capture users. It's definitely a challenging problem for us as we want to balance demonstrating the additional value of ReelSurfer (which is that you can cut and watch highlights + mashups from all videos across the web, not just YouTube) without getting super annoying. In this particular scenario, if the branding strip only appeared on hover (and disappeared during playback), would that be a better/tolerable experience?<p>Thanks again!",1356754535

Most of the pain of dealing with SQL comes from the relational part, not from needing a schema.<p>The problem with SQL is that it's <i>clever</i>. To do things efficiently and reliably, you often must do very clever combinatorial operations on different tables, producing elaborate structures which are then winnowed down to a simple list of information. So right off the bat, you encourage programming logic that is difficult for future maintainers to wrap their heads around. Of course, most programmers <i>aren't</i> clever, so their queries end up being both difficult to understand and subtly wrong.<p>Then, of course, your data comes out as a list of rows.

Ultimately, I would say monads are about composition: they let you define exactly how to compose computations.<p>Additionally, monads do not break type inference. Having a type for every top-label binding is considered good style in Haskell, but it is still optional.  I could see this practice being confused for type inference not working. There are of course language extensions that do break type inference in certain cases, and sometimes it is impossible even with the standard language, but it works almost all of the time even with monads.<p>Also, and this is probably just because this article is for years old, it really overstates hire bad Haskell performance is.

I'm partially at fault for the confusion here for talking about ""privilege"" as an absolute.<p>Privilege is something that basically <i>everyone</i> has. It's about talking about the advantages one has due to factors like sex, race, geography etc over others when all other things are equal. It's not a concept that is focused on race or gender; but any sort of difference. The reason that I think it often focuses on race and gender is because those are areas where people are particularly unaware of their own privilege and where the issues are most crucial.<p>As you point out, you could have a young black women who grows up wealthy and this would imbue her with some privilege related to that compared to a poor white male.<p>However,<p>> A poor white boy growing up in Appalachia has less privilege than a member of any race or gender growing up in a California suburb.<p>As a general statement this is wrong; it needs to be qualified as above in terms of who exactly is being compared and on what sort of privilege. In this example both have some privilege and I'm not sure being wealthy would always out weigh being black and female (or vice versa).<p>What I do think is reasonable to say is that if you look at large groups, white males do have a bit more privilege than many other groups. Again, in particular instances this can be completely turned around, so context is important to keep in mind.<p>So why focus on white males in the general sense as a group with a lot of privilege? Because it's a converging of many types. They don't deal with many issues women and minorities do and even if you take a color/gender-blind issue like wealth; as a group white men are doing much better in that regard than others.<p>I agree though that it would be beneficial to consider it more widely, and it's important to try and do that in discussions.",1356753964

In the case of any kind of discrimination or behavior that is experienced by someone else, please start working to taboo your acceptance of and reliance on ""how you see it"". It won't help you understand someone else properly. It won't help you spot this kind of situation as clearly whenever you might run across it in the future and could perhaps be the sole person able to speak up and stop it.<p>Also, it is most helpful to orient your mind in the trajectory of the article--a reading of all the events leading up to a big event. It's a mini-history. It has a linear progression from the founding of CryptoParty to the Creeper Card bullshit at 29c3. Then she breaks. It makes an incredible amount of sense when you allow yourself to experience it as the author did--this isn't some here's ""a few cases of explicit sexism"" article and then an extrapolation of ""the reason <i>everyone</i> is saying rude things to her."" This is a here's-all-the-bullshit-I-experienced-in-rough-chronologically-incessant-order-until-I-broke article. Now, add to that that CryptoParty only started up <i>about four months ago</i>. <i></i>She experienced all of this in FOUR months time.<i></i> Judging by that timeline, I find it highly unlikely that one could so easily chalk it all up to being in the wrong, other people knowing what they're saying/doing, and still have all those other experiences. I think this was a case of a bunch of men who didn't know how to be led by a woman who came up with a really badass idea.<p>> <i>Perhaps she is not as knowledgeable or as experienced as she thinks she is, and so she is receiving criticism from those who know what they're saying/doing.</i><p>Reading this after the article seems as if you missed quite a few of her disclaimers. For example, she admits <i>repeatedly</i> that she is neither as knowledgeable or experienced in a number of technical areas, but that is not the point here. She's not criticizing the technical aspects of things (at least, not to any degree that reads as more serious than asking questions that any organizer would ask to have clarification and understand the reasons for doing X over Y). I see few, if any, examples where she, as the organizer, faced off against someone on the technical merits of anything at all--the only way knowing ""what they're saying/doing"" would actually have any weight.<p>In fact, most of the account reads as someone who was actually smart enough to recognize the limits of her skill set and not try showboating well beyond one's level as so many men in tech do.<p>Let's call her the non-technical founder, shall we? It's a term everyone on HN seems to understand and, usually, respect.<p>So here we have a non-technical founder who is also a woman. And not just a woman, but a single mother. That's effectively three strikes against her in the tech world, as far as I can see. I'm a technical, male, single-parent and I don't ever have to deal with shit from anyone. I'm not cross-examined in a project meeting or a conference because I am the daddy-type. Nobody questions my experience or the soundness of my advice because I have to leave by a certain hour to pick up, feed, bathe, and play with my kids. I have never seen a woman treated that way--much less a single mother who is non-technical--while working in or engaging with the tech world.<p>> <i>...she takes a few cases of explicit sexism and extrapolates them as the reason why everyone is saying rude things to her. ... but even then much of the criticism she received could be seen as fair if she was actually in the wrong.</i><p>Did you actually read (and maybe re-read) the opening where she states quite plainly that she is <i>not</i> chalking everything up to sexism? <i>""Some parts of this article deal with misogyny, sexism, and harassment, while other aspects of it respond to experiences of down-right douche-baggery.""</i><p>How about the bits where she talks about criticism she experienced? She lists several instances of it. She doesn't extrapolate that it's all sexism purely, but that there is behavior that is gender-targeted, douchey, harrassing, etc., occurring when she is questioning or reacting to decisions that were made (e.g., the no-laptop rule, the logistics of writing a manual that received shit planning from these people who supposedly ""know what they're saying/doing"", publicly taking the blame when others' shit-brained ideas blew up, the shitty dickhole creator of CryptoCat, etc.). She didn't say each instance was sexist.<p>But even that doesn't matter. She's the founder. She busted her ass to organize the whole thing.  It seems she involved a number of smart technical people to cover the gaps in her skill set. That's what a founder does. And when the technical people are criticizing the founder, that's some pretty dangerous ground. The non-tech founder isn't held to the same standards as the tech co-founders & team. When the founder asks questions about whether something is a good idea, or whether someone is doing the right thing for the org, there's not much wiggle room here to try and assuage the problem by throwing her into the ""she was wrong"" camp.<p>> <i>I thought if the gap between cryptographers, hackers and users could be bridged...</i><p>Here's the core of CryptoParty, directly from the non-technical founder. Bridging the gap between these disparate segments of the population who could benefit from the party. And who better, from my standpoint at least, to get on your team for achieving this goal than a semi-technical single mother who is passionate about bridging this gap and has a lot of energy and life she wants to live outside of her parenting duties?<p>She came up with and organized the idea of the CryptoParty, with very specific goals in mind--both for the group's aim, as well as its community standards and practices. She repeatedly brings up multiple situations where she objected or questioned others involved about actions that were going against those goals. As the person who appears (by her account) to pretty much be the first-mover, I was left with the expectation that as I read through the rest of the article, I would read the experience of someone who wanted to shepherd a community in light of its goals while being admittedly non-technical, and how everything went awry in a way that was very personal (founders are usually the ones we expect to have the most personal investment, right?).<p>> <i>There was certainly plenty of it without any sexist connotations.</i><p>You can't rightly judge from a distance the degree to which vitriol was directed at her with sexist intention. Note I say <i>intention</i> and not <i>connotations</i>. Connotation is a deceptive thing that, when focused on, makes one think s/he is successfully spotting discriminatory, sexist, racist, what-have-you acts. You have to look beyond the connotations because it's much too easy to hide a predisposition to reject anything a certain gender says behind a litany of jargon and adequate explanations, smartly avoiding trigger words that connote the sexist intention. Plenty of good ideas are rejected because of their source of origin, not their technically sound qualities.<p>Moreover, there are things that are said that seem to me would not so frequently have occurred had the organizer been a man. If the organizer had been a man, technical or not, the tone of disagreements would have been very different. His reactions may not, as the organizer, been very different from hers--but the key is that they would have most likely been interpreted <i>very differently</i>. Nobody would tell a male founder that he wasn't being ""level-headed"", or tell him to quit, or call him emotional, or anything else that frequently is launched against women. I've seen men in screaming matches over ideas, passionately and intensely convinced they're right, shouting obscenities and hurling personal attacks that have nothing to do with the issue, and nobody ever busts in and calls them a bunch of emotional basketcases who aren't level-headed enough to lead or make decisions. And yet women don't have such privilege and protection.<p>---<p>As far as I can read, this is one hell of an account of how not to treat your non-technical founder/co-founder/teammate. It's just reprehensible and wrong. Especially the bits about the application to 29c3. I was reading that trying to imagine a world in which the Python community would behave that way if, say, Jesse Noller wasn't able to afford making it to PyCon or something. Or if Jacob Kaplan-Moss couldn't afford to make the trip to a DjangoCon. Or anything similar. Say there's one spot open to have a talk, like her situation. I can't see anyone from those communities acting in such a way as to throw shit in those guys' faces while they're trying to turn that talk into a panel that allows other applicants to take part with them or whatever -- and then turn around and not only succeed in keeping those guys out of the party, but talk about how great it's going to be to get together. It's just atrocious behavior.<p>Moreover, that image of the Creeper Cards is just disgusting. That kind of behavior isn't even appropriate when scrawling it on a desk in middle school, much less a conference. That looks like it would barely belong at the AVN Expo.",1356753732

And looking at the games I've enjoyed in the last 12 months - Skyrim and MW3 (for purely multiplayer funsies) I don't feel like I've missed anything having an ancient machine.<p>And dont think I havent logged many hours playing either. A console doesnt mean Im just casually playing games - I take a deep delight in sitting down on my couch with a beer, dog by my side, and blapping annoying teenagers online whenever I get the chance.",1351054643

You need to see all the data packets in a group before you can finish calculating any of the coding packets, but nothing stops you from sending the data packets immediately.<p>On the other hand, non-hardware-based error correction that allows for recovery from a large amount of data loss is relatively processor intensive, and the processors in a lot of network equipment are very slow. So you can easily see an increase in latency, not because the packets take longer to send, but because the processor in the network equipment is too busy calculating error correction to timely forward your packets.",1351053481

Would I need a PC? Why would I bother to own one, especially if PC maintenance was of no interest to me?<p>I think this embodies a larger distinction: Are you mostly a consumer or a producer? The line isn't firm, but for someone who mostly consumes, a tablet or equivalent makes total sense for the reasons you enumerate.<p>For almost anyone who produces or aspires to produce, however, I don't think that laptop/laptop-with-docking-stations/desktop-style machines are going anywhere, for the reasons that are being articulated throughout this thread. I especially like the guy with four monitors. Personally, I only have two, but one is very large, and even then I'd like to imagine that it's not the size, but how you use it.[1]<p>Again, I don't think this distinction is hard and fast, so the person who just wrote their own operating system, followed by a 1,000 page fantasy novel, on their iPad can reframe the comment they're about to make.

We have 25 attendees, 24 of them are brand new to the hackerspace. All the attendees are technically literate and interested, but only one or two are programmers or heavily into technology. Everyone brings their own laptop.<p>The first hour of the first session was almost entirely spent with everyone setting up their laptop with the Arduino software. At least 3 of the attendees took closer to two hours, both with weird Windows problems and driver issues and random slowdowns, unexpected software alerts, etc. One took more than the workshop's 3 hours to get running smoothly, her laptop finally deciding it needed to install many dozen security updates.<p>All four of the people whose Windows computers caused them such slowdowns told me ""I barely ever turn this on any more, I just use my iPad/tablet and phone at home.""<p>This is purely anecdotal and it's a small sample size, could easily be non-representative.

Intellectual Atrocities<p>Ive heard a definition of an entrepreneur as someone who moves forward regardless of knowledge or resources. It provides a nice contrast to the corporation that cant move forward regardless of their deep pockets and vast amounts of knowledge and research.<p>Ive held several senior-level marketing positions in my life that put me in charge of product development. I found myself doing market research studies, hiring engineers, patent attorneys, artists and taking trips to China. Of course, I am a team player, so I had to get the input from the other managers, the bosses, the CEOs, CFOs and C-who-knows before I could move forward on a decision. We planned product cycles over a year in advance and organized a full-spectrum of marketing activities to help launch them.  It was mind-numbing. I would find myself calculating the dollars per hour that it cost the company for my colleges and me to sit in meetings discussing the product ad nauseam making steps forward that were so small that to attempt to measure them would be futile. Painful.<p>Somehow we would manage to push a product out the door. Sometimes it would fall on its face and we would be back to the drawing board. Other times it would take flight and surprise us all. Never, however, did it actually perform as expected.
The Bliss of Ignorance<p>Back in Kansas, when I was passing out promises to deliver outerwear to my customers I had no idea what it took to design a new clothing product, let alone how to manufacturer it. So, armed with a total lack of understanding, I opened the Want Ads to see if I could find a used sewing machine (not that I knew how to actually use one).<p>Soon I found a truckload of equipment from a retired tailor, I found a woman who could sew, I found several bolts of fleece material and I was given plenty of zippers, grommets and those little spring-loaded bungee-chord gripper things (I still dont know what they were called). I was now in the outdoor clothing manufacturing business. It took less than a week and I had no problem filling my orders. This is the kind of thing you can accomplish when you have no idea what youre doing. It was easy, but if I had known how difficult it should have been, I never would have tried it.<p>Probably the most common question I hear investors ask entrepreneurs is, if this idea/product/service is so great, why wont the big guys enter the market? After all, they conclude, big companies have plenty of market experience, plenty of cash and an army of executives with no shortage of brainpower.<p>This is exactly the problem.

Data centers are going to use every affordable optimization at their disposal, so if we want to know ""will tape drives be competitive against HDDs"" we can't handicap HDDs by comparing mirrored arrays of tape drives to straight, un-optimized HDDs.<p>With that said, I outlined in another comment[1] why a mirrored array of tapes would have pretty huge drawbacks regardless. Even if you have an expensive array of tape <i>drives</i> (as opposed to one drive with many tapes), a mirrored array will drag your write seek performance toward a constant worst case as the array grows. The same is true of RAID 1 for HDDs, of course, but the worst case seek time of an HDD is orders of magnitude less than that of a tape drive, so HDDs still win.<p>In any case, if you look at the details of the situation, the answer you come to is pretty boring: tape drives can compete with HDDs in a small slice of real world cases (often when used in conjunction with HDDs), and higher density tape drives will slightly widen that slice.<p>If you have a situation where you are writing a <i>ton</i> of data, but almost never reading or erasing, then high density tapes will play well to that situation (sans mirroring).<p>If you have a situation where you are writing a relatively small amount of data over a long period of time, reading it back comparatively frequently, and never erasing anything so that your total storage needs become very large, then <i>maybe</i> a mirrored array of tape drives would make sense, if it were behind a sizable HDD array.

This makes me much less likely to put you in the critical path of my business. So charge more and make everybody happy!<p>Suggestion: segment on the complexity of the product tour? Maybe by the # of steps included? Or (better) allow me to add audio/video to my tours and charge me more for that.",1351051290

I'm extremely interested in the Surface Pro though. If I can dock my Surface Pro to my keyboard, mouse, big screen and speakers, it could replace my current laptop, while being much easier to bring with me.<p>In the end, it will probably be between an Ultrabook like the Lenovo X1 Carbon, or the Surface Pro, with the Surface having a slight upper hand  because I can use it as a tablet as well.",1351051221

I've heard of multiple studies concluding employers hire those candidates that are the most ""like"" them.<p>I read a book called ""Money Ball"" last year.  One of the lessons I took away is that a successful baseball team can be created from undervalued stats (i.e. irrational beliefs in value cause inefficiencies).  This trend you described forms teams of walkers xor home-runners, for example.  I don't know why I believe this (I'm subject to my own criticism), but I strongly believe teams with multiple talents outperform teams with one talent (generalists vs niche).",1290261530

1924489,comment,1924114,1924436,0,0,_delirium,,,"Some of that culture develops pretty early, I think. Certainly by undergrad there seems to be a culture at many engineering schools where it's a point of pride to put in lots of hours. Sort of part of the ""hardcoreness"" to brag about 16-hour coding binges, weeks of sleep deprivation, etc.<p>On the other hand, there's also a culture, possibly smaller, of doing the opposite: making it a point of pride to <i>not</i> put in lots of hours, while still doing top-quality work. That culture emphasizes a different kind of hardcoreness, sort of the hackerly virtuoso who can bang out an A-quality semester project in a single day of in-the-zone wizardry.<p>I definitely notice that among adult engineers as well, at least as far as attitudes go (not sure how much variance there is in actual hours worked). There's the person who brags about how much they work and sees 9-5ers as slackers; versus the person who sees 60-hour weeks as a kind of failure, and instead brags about the time he fixed a huge problem in 3 hours and left work in time for happy hour.",1290261180

1924477,comment,1924191,1924191,0,0,joelmichael,,,"I have spent way too much time in ironic internet communities and ""lol"" is still popular. Tone is mainly an issue of character development. The cool people will understand when you are being ironic based on knowing who you are. This is only possible in actual communities with a limited number of regulars where people pay attention to usernames, avatars, and individual posting styles. In places like Reddit or HN where you are effectively just another anonymous poster, that character development is sort of impossible, restricting your communication options to something generic and official. If there was any interest in changing this, allowing us to add an icon next to our posts would dramatically increase user recognizability on HN.<p>On the SomethingAwful forums, only the lame (but very popular) boards such as ""General Bullshit"" require that you type with proper capitalization and punctuation, and will actually punish you if you use ""lol"". The relaxed and more communal boards typically type in all lowercase and acronyms are common. Yes there's a hint of irony in even using the acronyms but they are still not going anywhere.",1290260725

1924471,comment,1924108,1924108,0,0,Eil,,,"Roundabouts make a lot of sense when designed properly, and in the right place. I love them (they're just plain fun to drive through), but these are probably the top issues:<p>1. We mid-westerners, by and large, have never seen a roundabout before, let alone know how to properly drive through them. They weren't even so much as mentioned in driver's training classes around here until a few years ago. Whenever a new one goes up, there's a lot of confusion. The most common problem is misunderstanding or ignoring the yield sign: Some people treat the roundabout like a circular four-way stop and others just zoom in without yielding and cut off the traffic already in the circle.<p>2. Inconsistent entrance and lane rules. We have two major roundabouts in this town, both installed within the last five years. One of them prohibits lane changes inside the circle, one doesn't. At one of them, traffic entering the roundabout yields to traffic in the roundabout. In the other, vice versa.<p>3. Building roundabouts in an area for no good reason. On I-75 outside of Saginaw, there's an overpass with on and off ramps. A few years ago, they tore out the traditional traffic signal used on every single other on/off ramp in the state and instead put a roundabout on each end of the bridge. This was a very silly thing to do because the traffic volume was not that high in the first place. Moreover, it's a very industrial area with lots of big trucks and oversize loads that now have to navigate the roundabout very slowly and very carefully just to stay in the lane and not run into passenger vehicles whose drivers aren't paying attention.",1290260488

So it is helpful to offer a variety of formats to be more remarkable. In addition to our forum we offer: a monthly newsletter, private paid tools, free public tools, blog regularly, videos & training modules.<p>Another point I would add are that brand matters a lot ... if you are asking people to pay for something were there are free offerings in the marketplace (even if the free ones are far worse) then people really need to believe in you to want to buy from you. Thus we offer a good number of things for free, including some tools & our blog.<p>The last thing I would say is that many private membership websites are quickly ghost towns that die. The hardest part is building up the initial critical mass. You can always raise rates later, but sometimes it helps to have lower rates off the start to buy that marketshare and help build momentum. For example, we charged only $50 a month for the first 100 customers & gave our ebook customers a free trial...these meant we had a vast active community right out of the gate.

That's definitely a problem that needs addressing.</i><p>If this is a major general point, it should probably be explained as such; picking 4 specific examples and discussing them as free-standing, independent issues didn't convey a greater issue of ""the Cocoa interfaces are too verbose for 95% of use cases"" to me. If it's literally 4 methods, even namespace-prefixed category extensions seem a pretty attractive option to me.<p>Granted, clarifying that would have reduced the list to 9 points rather than 12, making it 25% less linkbaity.",1290259224

It depends I guess if they were upfront in the workload expected and set the salary to reflect that.<p>Certainly I understand that there are times when someone would choose to waiver the rights, a startup with interesting tech and probably equity would be a good example.",1290259179

But just because she wasn't worth $6m when she joined, it doesn't mean that she's not worth $6m now.  Almost nobody (maybe 1 in a billion, and that's if you include professional athletes) is worth $6 million if they're only just starting out.  But after establishing an amazing track record, that's when a lot of people are able to cash in.  I think it may be naive if we attribute the dollar amount to only what knowledge she can bring to Facebook, and disregard whatever merit she can bring herself to the table.  When was the last time you heard of someone being paid millions to just shut up and do paperwork in the basement mail room?  I think that stuff is just for spy novels, no?",1290259120

My HN November Launch, Minklinks was inspired by not wanting to leave the web page when I share a link (and by Instapaper's bookmarklet).<p>Recently this has encouraged me to look for more areas of niggly things that could be made better.

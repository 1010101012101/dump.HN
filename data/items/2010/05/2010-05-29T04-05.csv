1388368,comment,1387800,1387800,0,0,mlLK,,,"I've been thinking about implementing something similar except with the opposite sort of sentiment that <i>this project, application, program was poorly optimized, bug-ridden, and could use some improvement</i>.<p>Easiest way I can describe is take all that crap on all those code snippet sites out there + all the basic features from DCVS + some experienced developers/programmers with some time to kill + somebody that knows what they've written is crap yet functional and is looking for some suggestions.<p>I got the idea from the simple fact that there are still plenty of people out there writing sub-par code who could never dream of pushing something serious they've written to github or bitbucket. The goal I had in mind was to a create sort of preliminary sandbox for users to push projects/snippets anonymously to a place where others could criticize, make fun of, and explain to them why their code fails. I'm sure the concept could easily attract programmers trolling other programmers, but that's also part of the fun since the community your pushing it for know their code was crap to begin with.<p>A couple more comparisons I couldn't resist: a DCVS for 4chan or extending pastebin to the point that it has an API and a user community who prefer logging and learning from their failures by contributing to this repository.",1275108602

1388361,comment,1387965,1388298,0,0,silkodyssey,,,"User-created sections like the subreddits on reddit would be cool. In fact I think the subreddits are what I prefer about reddit over digg. I mainly go to the programming subreddit and sometimes I am deceived into thinking that all of reddit is about programming because it in itself is a large community.<p>But apart from the programming subreddit I go to the AMA section from time to time and that has allowed me to really grasp the beauty of the subreddit system. It allows each subreddit to develop it's own personality in that it's not just the topics that change as is the case with a category system but the feel and concept of the community changes as well and it offers a unique experience to learn and interact.<p>You guys really did a great job with Reddit!",1275107692

Mine lasted exactly 4 months from the day I joined to the day we launched...I was joining an already-existing project that was fairly far along, though.<p>It often takes 12-18 months before you have a good enough understanding of the company and your own desires to figure out where you <i>want to be</i>.  (And often more - I know people who joined in 2007 who are just now working through this.)  But that time isn't all spent on one project: typically you'll work through a bunch of them, all in the same focus area.  I think this is more akin to the normal process of discovery that most young people go through, though, and not something specific to Google.",1275107477

1388347,comment,1387458,1387458,0,0,lionhearted,,,"The problem is, the author suggests banning words just based on her personal impression of them without testing or feedback. Some of those words or phrases - Welcome, please, click here - might perform better in A/B testing than anything else for some sites and products. If so, they should be used. ""Features"" is the understood jargon and common navigation in certain industries.<p>Actually, she did mention testing once:<p>> After I mentioned this at an industry event last year, a travel company contacted me to say they simply removed  ' * denotes mandatory field' and replaced it with 'you must fill in the boxes marked * ' and saw an immediate uplift in conversions.<p>See, that's good. That's how you do it. Change if conversions or goals reached are going up when there's measurable goals. For more subjective stuff, sure, maybe make it spicier, entertaining, literally descriptive, or concrete. But it's a bit silly to say ""the word 'solutions' is overused, don't use it"". There's a reason people use the word solutions, which is that it's the most effective word lots of times. But don't take anyone's word on it, split test it on your own site and use whatever works best. Don't blindly go with intuition, intuition is often wrong.",1275106240

Mainly, though, I had a choice between a promotion at my current company, where I know exactly what I'm getting into, and a job at Google, which is a giant black box from the outside with a promise that they'll find you something you will want to work on. (I had two other job offers as well in fact, so it wasn't just those two choices)<p>Probably the hardest decision I've ever made.  I'm sure I would have been happy with any of the offers, but I feel like I might as well take up my employer's offer and see how things go for the next year or two (also they offered more salary than Google did but the bonuses aren't multiplied like they are at Google).",1275106096

Django has more ""magic"", which freaks me out. Pylons, on the other hand, mostly consists of glue code to tie different modules together and the Pylons book goes to great lengths to explain how this glue code works.<p>Setting any one of them for development is easy: just install them in a virtualenv using pip.

1388331,comment,1386854,1386854,0,0,stevenwei,,,"Congrats, it has been quite a while since their last release.<p>A short comparison to Django:<p>- SQLAlchemy is badass.<p>- Jinja2 (or whatever templating language you like) is also badass.<p>- Passing data to your templates using a global 'c' object is <i>weird</i> and seems rather hack-ish to me.<p>- None of the third party form libraries are as good as Django's forms, especially when it comes to ModelForms (FormAlchemy's API is rather lacking, IMO). WTForms is the best I've seen so far, but it's lacking model integration.<p>- Both of the major user auth systems (AuthKit and repoze.who/repoze.what) are lacking compared to Django's contrib.auth. I found them convoluted, somewhat overengineered, and difficult to set up. Doing authentication in the middleware layer is the wrong approach, IMO. You shouldn't have to shuffle user data and login state around using redirects, query strings, and environment variables. If you search around on this topic, a lot of people end up recommending rolling your own. Blargh.<p>- Pylons puts a lot of cruft in your project when you create an new project. I'm not convinced how much of this stuff is actually necessary, especially at the beginning of a project.<p>- The docs have tended to lag behind the actual releases. For example, at one point url_for() was deprecated in favor of url(), but a lot of the docs still referenced it and it was not obvious where to find the documentation for url(). In fact, it's still not obvious. Sometimes you see TODOs in the documentation itself that make you wonder how up to date the docs actually are. Hopefully this has improved since I last used it.<p>My biggest issue with Pylons is when you run into needing a third party library like forms or user auth, you have to spend time researching 2342 different libraries, only to discover that many of them have fallen into disuse, or are poorly documented. On the other hand, it's great when it lets you choose well written components like SQLAlchemy and Jinja2.<p>Django and Pylons both have their pluses and minuses, but I think there is still a lot of room for improvement in the Python web world. Armin Ronacher seems to be making lots of progress with Flask, maybe we'll see that grow into a bigger project.",1275105701

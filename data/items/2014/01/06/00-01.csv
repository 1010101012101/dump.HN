I often take care in how I formulate myself when I write here considering the primary US audience in order to avoid misunderstandings and what not, not to mention the whole community having a shared US viewpoint unless stated otherwise, and not to mention how heavily US-centric IT itself is. This might be slightly how minorities and/or women feel about trying to fit in to IT as a minority (this is not to draw an equivalence - I&#x27;m not saying one is easier or harder than the other. This is just relating).",1388966744

I've had people make loud, public complaints about such trivial matters as a new logo being too tall, or a text box being too wide, or an <i>optional</i> WYSIWYG editor feature ruining the ""text-only flavor of the community"".  These on websites far smaller than GMail.<p>Look at some of the major Web2.0 kerfuffles in recent years.  Off the top of my head, I can think of:<p>- The HD/DVD mutiny on Digg<p>- Public suicides on both JoelOnSoftware and Justin.TV<p>- Reddit storing passwords in cleartext and them getting stolen off a laptop<p>- Ariel Waldman and the Twitter harassment fiasco<p>- The Flickr censorship debate here: <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/40074/page3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/40074/page3/</a><p>Yeah, you could argue that those services are all still around, so obviously they haven't been hurt too much.  How much management time was wasted in dealing with them?  How many non-users decided not to become users because of something they heard 3rd-hand about how it's a terrible company?<p>(And I don't think the solution is to never innovate.  I can understand why a middle manager at a big company would think so, though - a PR disaster is by definition public and disastrous.  In the short run, it always makes more sense to not mess with success, it's just that this doesn't lead to success in the long run.)",1227913107

Perhaps Krugman would like to explain how the U.S. government could owe 8 trillion dollar bills, when only 850 billion dollars exist in the world.<p>The basic cause of both the depression and our current crisis is maturity mismatching - ie treating a collection of long term loans as short term deposits.

379627,comment,379529,379529,0,0,albertni,,,"I understand that Paul Krugman (the author of the article) didn't try to claim more than that the thesis of the Monetary History has just taken a hit, and that the target audience of the news item might not have the attention span for a longer more details argument. However, this kind of blog post encapsulates some of what frustrates me about economics, and in particular, economists.<p>Just from my fairly uneducated (in economics) viewpoint, this is what Krugman's post basically looks like.<p>a) The Fed has been much more aggressive about expanding the monetary base the last few years than from the start of the Great Depression through 1933.\nb) This doesn't seem to be working.<p>Problem is - there's no explanation whatsoever for why such an action may or may not help. There's no explanation for why it's legitimate to compare mid 1929 through early 1933 to late 2003 through late 2008. After all, there were CLEARLY some problems with the economy by the end of 1929, whereas I don't really think you could say it was anything like that in late 2003 (sure didn't seem that way to me). There's no explanation for why we should assume that the multitude of other variables (such as the collective behavior of society in 1929 versus that of 2008) that affect a situation like this, don't affect it enough that we can imply that we can look at Federal expansion of the monetary base as draw conclusions like we normally do about an isolated variable in a scientific environment. I'm sure Krugman doesn't think it's an isolated variable, but the whole thing is written in a way that kind of implies that. Plus, this is all just speculation as of this moment - while we are in the midst of a mini-depression at the moment, we are a long ways away from it being comparable to the Great Depression. While we're getting closer to that point, it's probably still premature to say that Federal efforts thus far have been wholly unsuccessful. All we basically know is that aggressively expanding the monetary base is not a one shot magic bullet that can singlehandedly prevent an economic downturn.<p>Ugh, reminds me of my mini-minor (a Humanities thing at my school) in economics, which I regret choosing to this very day, especially in that the blog gives me a taste of what could be a compelling, well thought out argument, but never gets there.",1227911738

379620,comment,379460,379550,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I used an infrastructure site as an example because the value proposition is easy to understand when you use a site that has a clear and simple monetization strategy. Video sharing sites are arguably an even worse example than S3, because the value of uptime is so hard to perceive or compute. It's likely that even Twitter doesn't understand the true value of a customer-hour of Twitter uptime, because the site isn't monetized and so much of the value is concentrated in the brand. Measuring that is like voodoo, only less empirical. ;)<p><i>If I have 5 users and the site goes down for 5 minutes, those 5 users will get 5 minutes each of annoyance. If I have a million users, each of those users will get 5 minutes of annoyance each also. There is no difference to the user there.</i><p>No, but there is a big difference for you! If a user is worth a dollar per year, the five-user site is worth five bucks per year, but the million-user site is worth a million bucks. If each patch to your code causes 0.1% of users to abandon your product (a number which depends on the odds that a patch will cause a rollback, and on the odds that a rollback will annoy a user enough to make them leave), patching a 5-user site costs you half a cent per year on average (most likely it has no perceptable cost, since odds are no users will leave) but each patch to a million-user site costs you $1000 per year in revenue. And that's just the <i>linear</i> cost. There are nonlinear consequences: one or zero annoyed users is nothing to worry about -- unless that user is Michael Arrington -- but a clique of 1000 annoyed users is potentially a <i>movement</i>: a critical mass of people who will all start complaining about your company on Twitter on the same day, potentially costing you your next 10,000 or 100,000 or 1 million users while simultaneously empowering your competitors, who may begin building the site that will take you down by poaching those dissatisfied users.<p>This is just the flip side of scalability. As a programmer you enjoy mighty economies of scale: Running a site with a million users is more expensive than running a single-user site, but it is <i>much less</i> than a million times as expensive. But this leverage also applies to your mistakes: a mistake that costs you a dollar when your site is small might cost you $1,000,000 when your site is big. And it's the same mistake! Typos are just as easy to make on big sites as on small ones.<p>Obviously, this doesn't mean that you shouldn't ever change the site. Presumably each and every one of your patches is valuable, and will <i>bring in revenue</i> to pay for its own insurance premiums. Right? :) But you do need to think about that calculation, because you do occasionally make mistakes. As your userbase grows, you may wish to test each patch on a subset of users to be sure they will <i>really</i> like it, and that the additional revenue is really going to be there. You may wish to institute tests and internal audits that lower the risk of rollbacks, or failover mechanisms to lower the cost of rollbacks. And before long, lo, you will be that which you deplore: A company with a bunch of annoying internal controls! But at least you'll have revenue to console yourself with.",1227911419

For those of you who've seen the code produced by people from all of these backgrounds, which major, if any, seems to produce the programmers who write the best code?<p>I've seperated music and math since there may be a difference between those two as well.",1227910166

Typing on a well designed computer keyboard bears no resemblance to pounding on an old fashioned mechanical typewriter, which is (I believe) what the M was trying to mimic.",1227910010

By nature, the people at large companies are more concerned with risk aversion than innovation.  This is also how managers like to ""hold power"" over the real innovators by controlling the change management process.  What makes a manager more qualified to deploy to production than the programmer?",1227909701

Until that changes, I will favor lower-energy experiments.<p>And, BTW, the whole idea of reducing carbon footprint, building more efficient cities, transportation and generally living consuming less resources is a great idea in itself.

I won't even bother with a site that looks like it was made in the 90s. With a better designed site I have a better chance of going back and using their service. <p>In my opinion you only have around 10 seconds to make an impression on me with your website. If I see an ugly site I won't even bother looking any further. I'll just click the back button and never go back to your site again.",1174604398

Anyone want to chat, or meet (at a pub, say)?<p>Going to the original startup school, and watching the YC dinner on Justin.TV has re-inforced how important it is to have a local support network. Even if you're not working on the same stuff, there's an energy that's motivating and focusing.<p>Whether you're planning to apply to YC, planning to start something locally, or already on the way, let's meet and share the energy.<p>You can contact me at spameatinggrin at gmail dot com.",1174603979

E.g. toronto.ycombinator.com, or somesuch.<p>I understand YCombinator's rationale for having founders move to Boston, or the Valley.<p>That said, it might be great for you guys to get local footholds, where people can meet, organize, find co-founders, etc., before deciding to seek YC funding.",1174603175

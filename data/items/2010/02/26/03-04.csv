They're free to keep the person on after deportation.  They're free to do those things even if the person isn't deported.<p>Yes, deportation may be a good reason for them to make certain decisions, but since they're free to ignore that reason, it isn't synonymous.<p>As to ""nothing to do"", the only reasons to discuss this are (1) if we let someone in on a startup visa, we shouldn't deport them if they fail, (2) folks who succeed on a startup visa might be deported, and (3) random cussedness.<p>Regardless, it's simply not true that being deported necessarily has the effects claimed.",1267156774

Piracy was a factor, but the N64 also didn't support CD-ROM because Nintendo was addicted to the control and revenue that the cartridge system gave them.  The N64 cartridges had lockout chips preventing unlicensed software, similar to the NES carts.   They even strengthened the system with a checksum calculated at boot.<p>I think Apple might be approaching a similar tipping point with things like Flash and Google Voice.

1152304,comment,1152247,1152247,0,0,patio11,,,"What you need on day one:<p>1)  Something which solves problems for people.  I assume you've got this covered.<p>2)  Some way to charge people money for solving their problems.  I like Paypal with e-junkie -- total integration time under 2 hours.  Your mileage may vary if you do subscriptions rather than one-time payments.  Subscriptions scare me.  Look into Spreedly.<p>What you may eventually want to build, buy, adapt from OSS code, etc (I have all of these in production and run a very small business):<p>1)  Analytics software.  Google Analytics is an easy snap-in for 1.0.<p>2)  Conversion tracking.  Again, GA for easy snap-in.<p>3)  Funnel tracking.  I like Mixpanel as opposed to GA.  You can find out why later.<p>4)  A CMS to publish content (for any definition of content) in a fashion which scales out of proportion to your personal time invested.<p>5)  Blogging software because every small business should have a blog.  Wordpress is an easy snap-in.<p>6)  Mailing lists.  I did this 3 years after starting my business.  Knowing what I know now makes me sad I waited that long.  MailChimp is an easy snap-in.<p>7)  A/B testing.  There are three acceptable options for Rails developers: A/Bingo, Vanity (<a href=""http://vanity.labnotes.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vanity.labnotes.org</a>), or write your own.  Friends don't let friends use Google Website Optimizer.  (I wrote A/Bingo, take this recommendation with a grain of salt.)<p>8)  Application health monitoring.  At the simplest level, you want to make sure that when somebody comes to your front page it returns HTTP 200.  For that, mon.itor.us is an easy snap-in.  You can make this arbitrarily complex.  For example, I test every ""moving part"" on my site in an automated manner so that I hear about stuff breaking before my users do.  You can read about a recent failure of this system (and all my other QC systems) on my blog.  When it works nobody hears about it. :)<p>9)  Anti-spam stuff.  Possibly applicable depending on what your application lets people do.<p>10)  An admin interface optimized for performing common customer service tasks.  I don't know what those are for your business.  As you find out what they are, automate or eliminate as many as possible.<p>11)  An admin dashboard collecting in a single place the stats/graphs/etc that drive your decisionmaking.  I have an article about this somewhere.  <a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/02/09/dashboard-design-for-metrics-savvy-software-companies/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/02/09/dashboard-design-for-met...</a><p>12)  Optional but recommended: you presumably have some sort of bookkeeping or accounting practices because eventually you'll need to file taxes.  This process presumably requires some sort of input from your business.  Automate the creation of that input.<p>13)  Widgets for distributing your content on other people's website are a low-investment way to get exposure which scales out of proportion to time invested.<p>14)  Database.  Backups.  Do you use MySQL?  automysqlbackup is a script created by the hands of God Himself and then planted into the minds of some programmer.  (Nota bene this assumes you have <i>one</i> SQL server with modest demands on it.  Works for me, not for Facebook.)<p>15)  Backups for all that stuff that isn't on the database.  I let Slicehost handle that.<p>16)  Every app will eventually re-implement email.  So will yours.<p>17)  User satisfaction surveys.  Easy, low-friction way to communicate with users and receive their verbalized expressions of how you can better support their needs.  (Users are much more willing to offer comments if you say ""survey"" and give them a survey-looking form than if you ask for comments via email.  Who knew?)  Wufoo all the way here.  Tip: give them something for participating.<p>18)  You may find it useful to publicly expose a portion of statistics about your application as a strategy for gaining attention.  If so, you need to have the stats and have a visualization for them.  Totally up to you on this one.<p>19)  Your application may need to perform longer running tasks outside the confines of the HTTP request/response cycle.  Look into Delayed::Job.<p>20)  If you accept user input and then crunch on it you may find that users are more creative than you are at producing input which results in output that is undesirable.  This might suggest to you that you should periodically run something roughly approximating a unit test or integration test on actual user input, in a scalable fashion, for example for identifying whether a bug reported by one user can be reproduced across other users.<p>That's all I can think of at the moment.  Good luck!  (It might sound daunting.  It isn't.  You only need two things today: solve problems, charge money for problems.  Everything else can be bolted on one piece at a time as you go along.)",1267156125

I was one of those guys who relied on coffee everyday, a day without coffee was unimaginable. But it also used to make me cranky, lazy (when the caffeine wore off), screw up my sleep pattern; high anxiety and sometimes depressed.<p>I figured if I could stop drinking coffee and try to find alternatives of the benefits of coffee (alertness), I could get rid of the disadvantages. The first few days were tough, I had intense headaches without coffee. But after I fixed my sleep pattern, started doing more workouts and replaced coffee with mint (decafienated) tea in the morning to help me wake up. I felt more alert and overall my mood has been better. I can say that I am happier because I stopped drinking coffee. :)<p>YMMV.",1267156120

So the fundamental thesis of hardcore indie developers being tempted by the lucrative cash piles to be had in Facebook apps seems pretty dubious.<p>The other contrarian point I'd like to make is that Facebook has actually been really kind to indie developers.  Facebook Pages are huge for self promotion: Facebook is consistently a top referrer for our game, even though it is a traditional, PC/Mac/Linux downloadable game (that's not even released yet).",1267154119

Anyone who's taken an intro-level security course or had any experience with webdev can tell you that ""unguessable"" is beyond being an oxymoron - it's a running joke. There's no such thing as security through obscurity.<p>Of course, they do offer password protection for Pro users, and if they're using SSL that's great too; I just feel like ""unguessable"" is not the best word to use when discussing any aspect of an app's security.<p>As an aside: the <del>mark up</del><ins>review</ins> tagline is fantastic!

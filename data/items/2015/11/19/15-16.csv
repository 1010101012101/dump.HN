10595448,comment,10585838,10585838,0,0,clarkmoody,,,"<i>> In the tender grades, the schools are a baby-sitting service during a period of collapse of the old-type family and during a time of extreme urbanization and urban mobility. In the junior and senior high-school grades, they are an arm of the police, providing cops and concentration camps paid for in the budget under the heading &#x27;Board of Education&#x27;. The educational role is, by and large, to provide -- at public and parents&#x27; expense -- apprentice-training for corporations, government and the teaching profession itself, and also to train the young, as New York&#x27;s Commissioner of Education has said (in the Morley case), &#x27;to handle constructively their problems of adjustment to authority&#x27;.</i><p><i>> These are a few speculations of one mind. My purpose is to get people at least to begin to think in another direction, to look for an organization of education less wasteful of human resources and social wealth than what we have. In reconstructing the present system, the right principles seem to me to be the following: To make it easier for youngsters to gravitate to what suits them, and to provide many points of quitting and return. To cut down the loss of student hours in parroting and forgetting, and the loss of teacher hours in talking to the deaf. To engage more directly in the work of society, and to have useful products to show instead of stacks of examination papers. To begin to decide what should be automated and what must not be automated, and to educate for a decent society in the foreseeable future.</i>",1447948770

Your job will include keeping our internal services running, improving our monitoring and incident response, running and automating service migrations and scaling, and feeding everything you learn on the front lines back into the development of our platform.<p>We&#x27;re a small team building a platform and a suite of compliance tools for digital health. Our platform is built around Docker on AWS. Our customers push source code and a Dockerfile to a git repo and our platform takes it from there: building, deploying, and running their image.<p>If you&#x27;re an SRE who&#x27;s looking to work on a smaller, ops-focused development team with a lot more impact and ownership, this is the job for you. If you&#x27;re not an SRE, you may also be a good fit for this position if you&#x27;ve enjoyed ops or sysadmin work in the past but want to write more automation code with modern tools like Chef and Docker on AWS. You&#x27;re probably also a good fit if you&#x27;re a developer who enjoys doing ops work and want to make the transition to shorter-term, higher-impact automation projects.<p>ABOUT US:<p>Aptible’s mission is to help our customers work safely with the most meaningful, sensitive data in highly regulated industries. To do this, we build devops tools that streamline information security compliance for web and mobile applications. We currently focus primarily in healthcare, on HIPAA compliance.<p>Our philosophy is that good engineering products and practices are the best competitive advantage for teams working in regulated technology. We build tools and provide services that help our customers gain those advantages. We serve all kinds of customers, from small dev teams to large business units of established companies.<p>We are backed by the best investors in tech, including Y Combinator (S14), Rock Health, Maverick and Lux Capital.<p>YOU ARE A GOOD FIT IF:<p>- You have extensive experience with AWS<p>- You are excited to work with Docker<p>- You have a professional background related to designing backend software systems<p>- You communicate well and work effectively with others<p>- You are comfortable with high degrees of freedom and responsibility<p>WHY WORK WITH US?<p>- <i>Engineering First:</i> Aptible is a tech company from the ground up. It’s founded by engineers, the team is predominantly engineers, and our users are all engineers. Your coworkers and customers will be some of the best in the world at what they do.<p>- <i>Independence & Trust:</i> Over time, you will be expected to function independently with minimal process overhead for significant portions of your work. This reinforces a high degree of mutual trust within our team.<p>- <i>Our Business Model:</i> We make money by charging our customers a monthly fee for software and services. This allows us to make decisions for the long term. We aren’t the type of startup where we give away everything for free in hopes that once we collect 100 PB of data we can build an AI to replace your doctor or sell pharma ads.<p>- <i>Our Customers:</i> We help the best companies in digital health solve their hardest engineering and regulatory problems. We involve them in our product development process and have a weekly support rotation in which the whole team participates. It’s a great way to learn firsthand the strongest and weakest points in the product.<p>- <i>Introspection:</i> Most of us have worked at a half-dozen companies or more. We’ve lived through best and worst practices in how to run teams. We value regular reflection on process (i.e., retrospectives) with constant small course corrections instead of bulk overhauls when things get really bad. We strive to make expectations clear and give regular, actionable feedback.<p>- <i>Professional Development:</i> In building our deployment platform, you’ll be solving new, hard problems at the bleeding edge of container coordination. If you believe that containers are the new paradigm, your work at Aptible will prepare you tremendously for the future. By helping our customers solve issues with their own open-source-based applications, you’ll quickly become an expert in many open-source frameworks and libraries.<p>- <i>OSS:</i> We believe in active participation in the open-source community on which we’re built. The majority of our GitHub repos are public. You will have the opportunity to create, maintain, and contribute to some of the most interesting projects in open-source.<p>- <i>Flexibility:</i> We are based in Brooklyn but our team is distributed across the country. As a senior engineer, you’ll have the freedom to work on your own schedule, from wherever you like. You’re always more than welcome at headquarters, and we will fly you in periodically for all-hands weeks.<p>- <i>Upside:</i> As an early employee, you’ll receive both competitive salary and meaningful equity in a company that’s growing fast. We think startups should give employees more stock, be more transparent about what percentage of the company that stock represents, and discuss what happens to that stock in various outcomes.<p>OTHER BENEFITS<p>- Full medical, dental and vision coverage — 100% of premiums for employees, 80% for dependent medical premiums, and 100% for dependent dental and vision premiums.<p>- Mandatory minimum vacation each year. Too often at startups, “unlimited vacation” means “no vacation.” We will force you to take time off. Our CEO will suspend your email and GitHub access if you don’t do it.<p>- Whatever computing setup you want.<p>Apply at <a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/cdc31a4d-e488-439d-96ff-898386bcdbdb/apply?lever-source=HackerNews"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/cdc31a4d-e488-439d-96ff-898386...</a>",1447948700

Unlike the ‘30s, we now have a decent understanding of phage biology as well as the infrastructure to keep phages cold until use, effective diagnostic tools, and most importantly, regulatory structures that shut out hucksters. The need is also dire, for example multi-drug resistant Staph infections kill more people in the United States than AIDS does.</i><p>> <i>Basic phage biology has also been undergoing a resurgence as we discover just how important phages are to the global ecosystem, they are indeed the dominant organism on Earth outnumbering anything else by two orders of magnitude. Indeed, despite being just ~125 nm tall (check this out for scale), if one were to stack the 1031 phages on the planet end to end you would get a tower that would stand 200 million lightyears tall. Our oceans are remarkably free of cellular life and the reason is phages, as well as the other the viruses of microbes. For example the growth and death of algae blooms are centrally mediated by viral dynamics. Meta-genomics studies of the oceans pull out more predicted phage proteins than anything else without some fancy filtering, and even then they get a bunch. Phages are also teaching us a lot about the primordial origins of life, they are after all proto-cellular organisms.</i><p>> <i>These days are exciting times to be interested in phages.</i>",1447948365

Take the same inputs that a person (making the decisions, for example to hire) takes as input to the algorithm (well, at least try to take in reasonable number of parameters). As an example outcome, take the subjective decision that would same person (or committee, what you have) make after a certain period of time, say 3 months (when it becomes more obvious whether the original decision was good or bad).

Most &quot;screen time&quot; studies are primarily or exclusively TV-watching studies, and in many cases are in turn using that as a proxy for sedentary behavior in general rather than actually examining media consumption patterns. In short, they don&#x27;t demonstrate that all screen time is equivalent, they just define the variable that way. That can be entirely justifiable from a study design standpoint, but also limits what the results can tell us.<p>The main source for recommending limitations on overall screen time for young children seems to be a set of recommendations published by the American Academy of Pediatrics [1], but they don&#x27;t actually cite any research (or their citations are too well-hidden for me). The AAP recently published a release stating that new recommendations are coming soon and suggesting that the old guidelines are unnecessarily rigid and unrealistic, even to the point of explicitly stating that &quot;The public needs to know that the Academy’s advice is science-driven, not based merely on the precautionary principle.&quot;. The top bullet point is &quot;media is just another environment&quot;.

Mainly, the fact that the code is fragile spaghetti that has zero unit tests (untestable by design) and there is a lack of software development process.<p>My issue is that I am feeling pressured from having to handhold QA after I fix a bug.  I spend more time doing this than actually writing code.<p>Here is a typical process to fix a bug in our application:\n1. A bug is found\n2. The reporter logs a ticket into JIRA often lacking how to reproduce the bug, and what the expected results are.\n3. The SE gets assigned the ticket and needs to contact the reporter to find out how to reproduce and figure out what the expected result is.\n4. After development, it is up to the SE to show the QA person how to test this new feature or confirm that the bug is fixed.<p>A few comments on QA:\nThey are non-technical.  Documentation is poor, so the SE&#x27;s need to show QA how to reproduce the bugs and what the expected result is. SE&#x27;s tried making step-by-step videos on how to test the code change, but that has proven to be a waste of time, as SE&#x27;s are still asked to be hands on with QA.  Sometimes there will be a bug deep in the architecture that can&#x27;t be reproduced in the front-end.  QA is very lost at how to test these.  Also, we get a lot of cases, where QA thinks that a test failed, but it turns out that they just had lack of knowledge of the acceptance criteria and prior functionality.<p>Management doesn&#x27;t want to enforce a process because it slows everything down.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m pretty lost here because I can hardly articulate the intricacies of the entire situation.  Is this common? I&#x27;d really like to get some sage knowledge on what&#x27;s going on here, cause all I see is a painful cycle.",1447947765

More crucially, it needs to be sure that it recognizes 100% of errors... it can&#x27;t make <i>any</i> mistakes about when it does decide that a given transformation is correct because bugs introduced by a mistaken translation are probably going to be extremely subtle and difficult to identify.<p>It&#x27;s a crappy situation.

So, let me help you focus your mind so it might product something of substance that&#x27;s actionable.<p>The point of the discussion is U.S. government and a chunk of America wants to stop foreign terrorists from trying to blow us up. The foreigners doing that have exclusively done it due to interference, often violent and imperialistic, in the Middle East. So, many of us draw the logical connection that this was the cause of <i>actual attacks against us</i> rather than terrorism in general which we don&#x27;t care about. So, to reduce number of attacks, we must stop doing what caused them and modify our strategy of dealing with the mess we&#x27;re in to account for this. Otherwise, our actions over there, esp collateral murder (err damage) & weapons distribution, will likely just create the next wave of terrorists like Bush/Cheney Administration just did with ISIS.<p>That&#x27;s my claims. Now, do you have any counter to those specific points or would you like to add to them? To be extra clear, given your sophistry, I&#x27;ve claimed the following:<p>1. The U.S. takes overt and covert action against Middle Eastern countries for financial and political reasons rather than for survival. So, it shouldn&#x27;t have taken that action and should reconsider future behavior like that.<p>2. Disruptive U.S. actions in the Middle East creates opponents, including the organizations that attacked us. So, they should stop doing that and fewer terrorists that <i>attack us</i> would be created.<p>3. Previous handling of opponents equipped and trained likely long-term foes before abandoning them. They consistently ended up turning into problems: Taliban; Saddam; ISIS. The U.S. needs to stop doing that. Throw their best minds on fresh strategy before doing any major interventions and with much focus on long-term effects with regard to terrorism blowback.",1447946397

However, you can read the whole story from another source, Show-Stopper, a book by G Pascal Zachary from the Wall Street Journal (1).<p>When Cutler was hired in 1988, both OS/2 and Windows were failing in the marketplace. The problems arose after Windows 3 sales started to take off in 1990.<p>Microsoft tried to get IBM to accept &quot;OS/2 NT&quot; as a replacement for the 16-bit OS/2, which was dead in the water. It refused, IBM and Microsoft divorced, and NT got rejigged for Windows compatibility instead of OS/2 compatibility.<p>(1) <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Show-Stopper-Breakneck-Generation-Microsoft/dp/0029356717"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Show-Stopper-Breakneck-Generation-Micr...</a><p>Remember that Microsoft got its power from IBM: it would have been nowhere if IBM hadn&#x27;t used its DOS and Basic in the IBM PC. IBM then resented Microsoft for &quot;stealing&quot; a small part of IBM&#x27;s rightful monopoly.<p>Microsoft would go to any lengths to hang on to the IBM connection, which Ballmer called &quot;riding the bear&quot;. The in-house Microsoft strategy for IBM meetings was BOGU (for Bend Over, Grease Up). Hence OS/2.<p>You may recall that, at once time, Microsoft saw Unix as the potential replacement for DOS. It did Xenix, which was the most popular Unix of its day. However, way back then, IBM had an implacable hatred for Unix and for AT&T, and owning OS/2 EE (not available from Microsoft) was the cornerstone of its plan to bring the PC industry under IBM&#x27;s control (OS/2 EE, PS/2, MCA, SAA etc).",1447946248

My most recent attempt became SenseBase[1], which worked well for the most part with some leading features, but I want to work with something easier to support.<p>I&#x27;m facing a couple more scraping projects, which are not my full-time focus, so I&#x27;d like to find some loosely coupled yet cohesive components which will work for years.<p>I&#x27;ve settled on Javascript as a language and ecosystem that is likely to be around for some time, and practical to use for Web scraping, particularly since it can be embedded in pages (and speaks the page language).<p>I&#x27;m strongly committed to open source and open data (I&#x27;d like to see all sites recognize the value of making their sites into data).<p>Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;d identify as components:<p>1. Shared schemas and functions to identify sites, their sections, and content elements.<p>2. Identify when a site has an API that relates to a page, to retrieve more precise data.<p>3.

A front end is separate, the goal is schemas and a store that can be developed and interacted with over years.<p>Semantic Web solutions would handle 3, but add so much weight the project becomes diverted.

With physical networks divorced from service providers, the company or municipality in charge of the actual cable/fiber makes their money from maintaining and improving capacity so they can sell access to more providers.  Providers compete by offering the best services and customer support in order to profit and pay for more bandwidth on the physical network.<p>But yeah, it&#x27;s more complicated (in terms of both business and networking tech) but it&#x27;s an ideal that many would like to move toward.",1447946166

9677253,comment,9674662,9676424,0,0,dljsjr,,,"This is all more or less correct… just a few things to add (I&#x27;m on Team IHMC Robotics) :)<p>1. It&#x27;s <i>highly</i> unlikely that this version of Atlas can get up from a fall under its own power, at least not expediently; it weighs much more than the old one and it actually has a slightly weaker hydraulic system.  The old pump motor was a constant speed/constant displacement 3000 PSI system.  The current one is a variable speed/constant displacement system that tops off at around ~2600 PSI, and the robot is around 35-40 lbs heavier than the old one. Even if the arms are strong enough, none of the COTS grippers that integrate with the robot could handle getting up; the fingers would explode. I&#x27;ve seen lots of videos of the old tethered Atlas getting up.  I find it amusing to think that the current one could pick itself up.<p>2. We (IHMC) don&#x27;t do ZMP based stability.  All of our walking/balancing is based on something called Instantaneous Capture Point, that the head of our lab pioneered during his PhD and which several other researchers have gone on to refine over the last 10 years or so. Lots of people use it for fall recovery (MIT does in their recent Atlas video that&#x27;s similar to ours) but we also use it for walking as well. We call it ICP, but vision people get cranky when we say that because ICP is also short-hand for Iterative Closest Point.<p>3. amjaeger is correct, our robot was very badly damaged by our falls on Friday. Enough that we were very worried about how it would impact our performance. Our falls on Friday were both more or less the result of operator error (with some hardware problems mixed in, but mostly operator error), and our stability issues on Saturday were the result of the falls on Friday.<p>4. The comment about manipulation being pure teleop is a little reductionist.  It is teleop in the sense that it&#x27;s not autonomy, but almost nobody was doing direct joint servoing which is what I usually think of when somebody says pure teleop.  For example, we actually operated continuously during comms blackouts. When we cut out the wall on Saturday, almost the whole thing happened during a blackout. But when your 400lb robot doesn&#x27;t have a safety line, it behooves you to be extra careful.  We cut out the wall just as slowly during perfect comms back in the lab because there&#x27;s lots of ways to screw that task up.",1433735823

I can see the possibility of people focusing more on the demo than the ultimate purpose of the code, in which case as you say you&#x27;d accumulate technical debt in the form of hacks.

9677236,comment,9676707,9676991,0,0,gojomo,,,"I find the hand-waving around the Maryland and Utah graphs to be great examples of the their motivated reasoning, and total blindness to the effect of conscious campaigning. (Appropriately, &#x27;campaign&#x27; is another word missing from their 38 pages.)<p>Romney easily won Maryland&#x27;s 2012 primary – 49% overall, presumably with the &#x27;big precinct&#x27; advantage they find suspicious. (But, the researchers don&#x27;t show us that graph or include any Maryland data in their tables.) But because the Maryland-2008 graph is &#x27;flat&#x27; for the &quot;same candidate… same state… same type of election&quot;, we are to believe all non-fraud density-driven vote-share effects are refuted.<p>But 2008 was a wildly different election! Other candidates were contending on the same axes of fundraising, organization, and compromise/moderation that Romney dominated in 2012. Another candidate (McCain) won the overall nomination, but looking at the Maryland graph, it appears both Romney and McCain barely even contested Maryland: both finished at about 6%, less than 1/5th the winner.<p>Do they show us McCain&#x27;s or Obama&#x27;s or Kerry&#x27;s or Gore&#x27;s or Dole&#x27;s or Perot&#x27;s or Clinton&#x27;s slopes in any state or election? No. They just pick one small, relatively urban, and electorally irrelevant (for Republicans) state, Maryland, in one year, 2008, and imply its flatness means something.<p>The same problem applies to their choice of Utah-2012 as another flatness example: Romney won with 93%! No one else spent a cent there! How does that reflect anything about the effects of density and campaign expenditures in actively-contested races?<p>This kind of cherry-picking of outliers makes their case, especially with regard to the density-issue, look extra-flimsy.",1433735347

Classic libertarian values are voluntary, organic collaboration over centralized, coercive, command and control.  Even the GPL is predicated on this.<p>Indeed, a symbiotic relationship that has developed between the world of open source and the proprietary projects of the tech giants startups and startups, all driven by the enlightened self-interest of all the actors involved, big and small.<p>As for the more dogmatic GNU-style Free Software movement, it makes a couple of (erroneous, in my view) assumptions about a inherent coerciveness of &quot;non-free&quot; software, and builds their entire philosophical vision out from that idea.   However, the continued eclipse of the GPL by more &quot;liberal&quot; BSD/MIT-style licenses seems to demonstrate that those assumptions are increasingly failing to validate.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to note that Eric Raymond, author of the Cathedral and the Bazaar, and one of the key collaborators that developed the term &quot;Open Source&quot; and the ensuing definitions, is a pretty staunch libertarian.

1) The mechanics of the game wasn&#x27;t the problem, it was the implementation of them.
2) Grinding has never doomed a game. It may be annoying, but many popular games -- including ALL RPGs -- feature grinding at their core.<p>Second, with respect to E.T., if you&#x27;re spending your time eating Reese&#x27;s Pieces, you&#x27;re doing it wrong. The candy has <i>nothing</i> to do with completing the game. Furthermore, the game can be completed without going out of your way to collect these at all.<p>Third, eating RPs isn&#x27;t not grinding. Grinding is when the game effectively pauses because the player can&#x27;t advance past some point because the player is underpowered for the new enemies, and overpowered when compared to the old enemies. It&#x27;s a balance issue, that gets passed off as &quot;fun&quot;. See Pokemon. See Final Fantasy. See every RPG ever made.<p>Repetitive game mechanics doesn&#x27;t doom games. Every party based RPG since Bard&#x27;s Tale has features the same Fight-Fight-Fight-Parry-Parry-Parry verb. 90% of all attack turns in these games comes down to that same attack plan. Hell, these games even configure their controls so that this is accomplished by just hitting the default button six times in a row. And yet, these games are beloved by millions.",1433734179

For example there were those who claimed that observing commandments mechanically, without intending to have the spiritual effect is actually worse than not observing while intending to have it.<p>This idea was expressed by R&#x27; Shmuel Alexandrov[1] when he was defending non observant Jews who intend to act righteously, vs. &quot;observant&quot; ones who don&#x27;t do it out of spiritual reasons.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shmuel_Alexandrov"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shmuel_Alexandrov</a>",1433733862

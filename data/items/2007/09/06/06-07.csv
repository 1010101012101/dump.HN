Then it got acquired by a huge co. with a real stifling culture and it was time to leave.\nOn the plus side, I made good money during that period, and managed to save a bunch, so now I'm using that to bootstrap my own startup.\n",1189061235

What's crazy is that he's trying to re-create Silicon Valley. If that's a goal it seems like he could do a better job by just investing all that money into a bunch of new startups.<p>\n<i>""We have three major goals for the Nano City: To re-create the Silicon Valley, create state-of-the-art infrastructure, and do all this in a fashion that is self-sustainable and exhausts natural resources to the bare minimum,""</i> said Bhatia[2].<p>1. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=49006"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=49006</a><p>2. <a href=""http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/263937.cms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/263937.cms</a>",1189061229

My experience with searching on the Internet also leads me to believe that search needs to get better and better. A lot of very interesting things are happening in the search field; vertical, social, etc.. \nBut, I will have to agreed that the major Search Engines are extremely good at the present moment. I use Yahoos Search API on my site, and am happy to fiddle around with their API's rather than build my own crawler (although I have real people adding links).",1189060482

Those cover all the major concepts to begin with [.]""<p>That's just blatantly false. They're probably good languages to know because they are collectively the lingua franca of programming at the moment, but there is quite a bit they never touch upon. Learning Scheme, Haskell, Prolog, or Forth would introduce you to ideas you would never encounter while using C & co.",1223297906

324834,comment,324485,324485,0,0,sd,,,"1. To bid on your DVD player, I had to randomly guess the lowest price.  The only reason I would pay more than the lowest price on Onista is out of frustration from having to guess the price. Unless the prices were wildly cheaper, I'd just go to eBay and ""buy it now"" and avoid the hassle.<p>2. Before you promote your site, get a copy editor.  I am very cautious about paying - let alone registering - on sites that have lots of typos.<p>3. Cut out as many features as you can.  This probably starts with the ""social network.""  Not only is the sheer volume of options confusing, but it's also impossible to maintain such complexity with three part-time developers.  There are a lot of broken links and titles that don't accurately reflect the content they link to (such as category links that say there are multiple listings, when there are in fact none, and vice-versa).  I'd rather have one simple and well-done feature than 10 half-baked ones.",1223297766

324828,comment,324578,324636,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I think Lua is a particularly good language to learn early: it's quite small and very approachable for somebody vaguely familiar with the C languages, but it has coroutines, tall-call optimization, and quite a bit of flexibility via its meta-tables. I haven't used it on anything big enough to know if it's really practical for me as a getting-stuff-done language, but it's really growing on me.<p>Also, can of worms and all, but the borders between ""an OO language"" and ""a scripting language"" are quite thin. You could learn OO from Python or (I suspect) Ruby. OO design made quite a bit more sense to me when it didn't have to work around flaws in C, C++, and Java's type systems.",1223297134

While everyone would love to have a multi-million dollar business, the reality is that there are a lot of smaller good ideas that don't need $1mil+ funding.<p>I think YC takes a better approach in the way of financing. However, I think YC forces a group to be extremely frugal and thoughtful in their fiscal decissions. I think receiving large funding may lead to improper investments to younger entrepreneurs; but that's just my $0.02.",1223296695

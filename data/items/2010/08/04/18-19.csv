They pay in generally raised prices, somewhat slower economic development, and the projects that are never born because they couldn't comply with the ADA, which this project nearly fell under.<p>It is not anti-little-l-libertarian for a people to democratically agree to pay a little extra via governmental means to accomplish something the market isn't good at. It is anti-capital-L-Libertarian, but I'm not claiming that's what I am.<p>The real problem is not that our society thinks the ADA is a good idea, the real problem is that for things that like we allow ourselves to be systematically deceived that the cost of the ADA is zero, and we don't have to think about the costs and benefits. This is a pervasive problem; neither liberalism nor conservatism includes explicit concepts of analyzing things for costs and benefits, which is why I consider neither philosophy directly applied actually suitable for ruling us. It's a very good idea to have underlying principles for your governing philosophy but they must always be filtered through a worldview that acknowledges our finiteness.<p>(Also, I am a little-l-libertarian, so when I said I'm not pinning this on liberalism in general, it is not because I was not a wee bit tempted. It was because it wouldn't be fair or true.)",1280945012

Of course it's all clear now though, and everyone has carefully adopted new positions.<p>>Some people want it to be market share even though the real name of the game is profit.<p>Wow, I care so incredibly little whether Motorola or HTC or Samsung makes boatloads of profit. In fact I think I would be a bit offended if they bragged about their great margins (who would clutch onto their copy of Windows and crow about how great a profit margin Microsoft made on it? That is just perverse). Profit margin, unless you're a material shareholder or have options, are irrelevant.<p>I care about the platform that I develop for, that I use, that empowers or limits us. That is what matters to me, and it's why I care. I don't care if Google doesn't meet their quarterly numbers.<p>>Comparing iPhone to Android isn't comparing apples to oranges. We're talking about one phone versus a host of phones on a host of carriers.<p>This is the new talking point, and it's a curious one. The strength of the iPhone all along has been paraded as the single vendor solution: It is consistent and high quality and you know who's behind it...what's with all this crazy Android fragmentation from who knows who?<p>That's been the line.<p>Now that's the weakness?",1280944992

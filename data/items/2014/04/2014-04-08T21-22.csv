The ease of the common app takes the pain out of requesting &quot;paper applications&quot; from colleges individually and college ranking lists are available for all to see. Most students have colleges segregated into:<p>1.) top choices; 2.) middle of the pile; 3.) safety schools<p>and it is mostly always the case that a lot of students are qualified enough to be at these institutions, so it is likely that this group will apply to the top 5 or 10 colleges because he fits the profile of the student most likely to attend these institutions. Almost 30% of applicants are applying to 7 or more colleges and these low acceptance rates will only perpetuate the increase in this ~30% figure because students are afraid that they won&#x27;t get into the top two college categories.<p>From the article:<p>> <i>Students applying to seven or more colleges made up just 9 percent of the applicant pool in 1990, but accounted for 29 percent in 2011.</i><p>> <i>..students send more applications than they once did, abetted by the electronic forms that have become nearly universal, and uniform applications that can make adding one more college to the list just a matter of a mouse click.</i><p>On another note I was recently talking with a CS professor and he mentioned that rankings are highly correlated with the years that an institution has been in existence which is worth thinking about.",1396994366

As in $100,000 build cost and almost half a ton of aluminum and plastic big. Obviously not something each employee can take home to work with remotely.<p>Since our control system hardware is pretty high level (Pentium-processor SBC scale), we have a lot of leeway in terms of footprint. So we simulate as much of the I/O as we can. This lets us do a lot of development without each developer needing the actual hardware for most testing. By abstracting the hardware away in this manner, the development becomes similar to server-type software dev that can be done on a desktop.<p>It doesn&#x27;t solve <i>all</i> the problems, but we can do probably 80% of our development work on our laptops and only need to do some critical testing on the actual machine itself.<p>Where the need to be in the office really hits is the interactions with electrical and mechanical engineers.

It&#x27;s only defined on 2d arrays (also known as &quot;matrices&quot;)<p>but this is not true.  Matrix multiplication is just a special case of contraction of indices in a tensor (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_contraction)—probably"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_contraction)—probably</a> the most frequently used case, but not the only one.  I&#x27;m certainly not arguing for the inclusion of general tensor-manipulating operators in Python, but it does seem to suggest a sensible alternative to:<p>> For inputs with more than 2 dimensions, we treat the last two dimensions as being the dimensions of the matrices to multiply, and &#x27;broadcast&#x27; across the other dimensions.<p>namely, just contract on the inner indices.

7556006,comment,7553745,7555285,1,0,IgorPartola,,,"Ubuntu absolutely can be MITM&#x27;ed. So can you when downloading the source code. Moreover, you don&#x27;t have to MITM attack Ubuntu (or rather Debian) into downloading a compromised version of the KeePass source. You could MITM attack <i>anything</i> the Ubuntu/Debian developers download, whether it be the source code to stuff that&#x27;s going into Debian/Ubuntu as a package or something they are installing on their machines. I repeat, at some point you have to trust someone, otherwise all software <i>and</i> hardware is suspect.<p>Now, the really big question to ask here is what processes do we have in place for this not to happen. Downloading stuff over HTTPS is clearly not good enough: there are many ways someone willing to compromise a distro can circumvent it (including forcing a CA to give out a rouge certificate, or simply threatening the individual software developer into accepting a malicious patch). The best I can think of is using the PGP/GPG web of trust. When Debian Maintainer Dave gets an updated version of the source for package foo from Programmer Pete, Dave can verify that Pete actually authored the code by making sure the source is properly signed with Pete&#x27;s GPG key. Dave knows Pete&#x27;s public key having properly exchanged keys with him in person. I think that&#x27;s the best we can do.<p>Mind you in the above we cannot guarantee that Pete does not turn to the dark side, either willingly or forced into it by a powerful adversary (NSA, drug cartels, etc.) The best we can do is that Dave is not also turned to the dark side <i>and</i> that Dave carefully reads and catches any security issues with the code Pete delivers to him.

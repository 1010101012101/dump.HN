I wish I was a programmer on the team, the lead programmer doesn't force the new guy to actually think about what he is doing.<p>Not bitter, but have seen it so many times before.

As ComputerGuru said, good architects prove their points. Maybe this ""kid"" is trying to get more formal in his communication and broad in his thinking. For all you know, he was trying to impress the author :)",1255679929

884988,comment,884967,884967,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"The problem is, good architects make the same claims, only with proof and arguments to back them. So this depends on you being able to tell the good architects from the bad ones at first.. which kinda defeats the purpose.",1255679629

884984,comment,883721,884459,0,0,axod,,,"* Never use a debugger, it's usually pointless.
* I hardly ever use getters and setters, and write by hand if needed.
* hashCode/equals/toString by hand when they're needed.<p>I also hate the thought of an IDE refactoring my code. I've seen it before, and I've seen it break stuff.<p>It's just typing :/<p>Authors of novels could use auto-complete. They could tab complete characters names. I expect they could use built in sentence constructs, or even re-factor parts of the novel. But they don't.",1255679263

884979,comment,883082,884295,0,0,xiaoma,,,"Actually the 100m and 200m records are about the same speed.  It's 9.58 for the 100m and 19.19 for the 200m.  And before this August when Bolt shattered his previous 100m record, the 200m record was significantly faster than the 100m.<p>But in any case, both miles and marathons are incredibly intense workouts.  In fact, from a physiological standpoint, middle distances are more intense than sprints.  Less than 400m isn't even enough to push someone to their lactate threshold.  Short sprints are run on the fuel already in the muscles.  Obviously, it still takes intense training (and the right genes) to sprint well, though.",1255678938

The problem wasn't so much the underwritten credit derivatives - for which there's an actual genuine business need, but rather governments who have enabled companies like Goldman Sachs (AIG, and Lehman - which the government of course let go under), instead of letting these guys get reborn through some type of accelerated bankruptcy structure or better yet, collapse to be replaced by nimbler, smaller competitors.",1255678923

884974,comment,884462,884462,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"Honestly, I'm more than happy with my bank (JP Morgan/Chase) staying as one big conglomerate. They certainly proved they knew what they were doing during the crisis and have managed to stay on top of things. The government doesn't have the right to punish private corporations for being too good, too smart, and too successful; though they have a huge track record of trying to do so.",1255678536

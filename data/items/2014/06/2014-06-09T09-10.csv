However, the project was so delayed that the factory closed its doors several years before it to be able to build the propellers...<p>So another company got to build them, but they were so large that they had to cast them in several parts  and weld them together instead of a single cast, which is apparently NOT best practice and hadn&#x27;t been ever done before.",1402307535

They went to devaluated the Yen not too long ago just so that Toyota and a few other major manufacturers could sell more products overseas. And now everything is more expensive in Japan (petrol price increased so all manufacturing goods and anything that needs to be moved around has increased significantly in price).",1402304550

For example, software won&#x27;t benefit from bugs being fixed if the rate of churn is very high, if new features are added rapidly and the size of the state space explodes. Times like that create technical debt. Surely technical debt isn&#x27;t antifragile. Since we still don&#x27;t know how to avoid it, it seems a stretch to say all software is antifragile.",1402304425

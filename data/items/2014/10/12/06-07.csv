8444639,comment,8443998,8444565,0,0,guygurari,,,"> I have yet to find a case where my pwd manager fails to do this (lastpass). I&#x27;ve also never (with the default settings) had a site reject a password generated by it.<p>A few minutes ago I registered to T-mobile, and 1Password thought that my username was something like mytmobile.aspx. I also find that 1Password has a very hard time with banking sites. There is at least one bank where it simply fails to login. YMMV of course.<p>Going beyond these anecdotes, even if these heuristics almost always work, I believe that having heuristics involved at all is preventing mainstream adoption. I think that if the password management interface is standardized and heuristic-free, then we will see password management support in the mainstream browsers. I am imagining a future where the auto-generated passwords work transparently so that users don&#x27;t even know about them. I think this cannot happen without browser support.<p>> Mobile apps are a different story, that&#x27;s where we really need standard system support for delivering credentials.<p>I agree that password management on mobile is a greater pain point, and (as mentioned elsewhere in this thread) the additional problem there is with entering the master password.",1413096840

Because of that, most other languages with their non-existent gui frameworks and messy IDEs seemed inferior in comparison as getting anything useful done on them was a pain. The jit interpretation allowed me to test my code without having to wait for compilation, at the same time, I can also export it as an compiled executable. Compiled vb is much faster than languages such as Python and Ruby that supposedly allow you to code fast. The current generation of .Net languages take ages to compile making test-driven development a huge pain sometimes.",1413096795

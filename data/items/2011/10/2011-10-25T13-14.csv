Any advice on the best way for an American to get onboard with an Aussie startup?<p>My family and I would like to emigrate to Australia in about 2015, and I'd prefer to get hooked up with a startup instead of trying to get on with a big multinational.<p>Based on talks I've had while planning this, it sounds like the point-based immigration system isn't as sure of a thing as sponsorship. Are startups in Australia in a position to sponsor a visa? Would an incubator be interested or able to help with something like that? Anything I can do now to help ensure that I'm employed with a startup down under in 2015?",1319551184

Compare that to my first year's salary which was roughly double that, and the cost begins to look minimal.<p>The opportunity cost is relative, since the people you meet in college may very well be the best resources you have for maintaining your drive, innovative spirit, and will to keep on. Just the discipline of finishing something is worth the time and money spent.

3154033,comment,3153722,3153919,8,0,michaelochurch,,,"I would make it simpler than that.<p>1. Don't procrastinate and get distracted. Even if you're taking hard courses, a college course load is rarely more than 50 hours per week. Average in hard majors is probably 35-40 all-in. That's not onerous at all, especially when you're only working 40 weeks per year (including internship).<p>2. Concentrate on learning interesting stuff, not on the grades. Good-enough grades (3.5+) will come from this for most people in most circumstances. There are hard-ass professors and even unfair ones (although I never had an unfair professor) but they are very rare and their damage is seriously limited.<p>I find it odd when college students claim they're going to sue professors over grades. Really? In college you're judged on the average of 30-40 (!) mostly independent grades. If you flunk a class and ace the other 35, you have a 3.89 GPA. In the real world, manager as career-SPOF is pretty much the default.<p>That said, I dislike grade inflation because it adds to the stress of college. If 2.0 were average, then acing a course could cancel out a failure. (When my parents were in college, a 2.5 was a perfectly respectable GPA and 3.0 was actually good.) With 3.2 as the average, flunking a course cancels out 4 As. That sucks. It makes people risk-averse and stressed out.",1319550721

3154028,story,,,1,0,jaz_12345,"Skycaddie SGX",http://www.completegolfer.co.uk/brand/skycaddie/,"Skycaddie SGX - The Best Golf GPS<p>If you are looking to invest in a golf GPS this Christmas, as a treat for yourself or for someone special, then look no further than the Skycaddie SGX. This is certainly one of those products that live up to all the hype surrounding it. The SGX offers an unparalleled range of features and a level of performance that leaves all other golf GPS devices a yard short of the green, making it the only real choice in golf GPS equipment this Christmas.<p>So what is it that makes the Skycaddie SGX, such a prodigious talent out on the course, that some people are calling it the Rory Mcilroy of golf GPS systems? Well lets take a look, shall we? Here are just some of its features:<p>o	3-inch, high-resolution, transflective TFT-LCD screen
o	Comes preloaded with up to 30,000 courses
o	Depicts hazards, Carries and layups
o	Utilises Skygolfs exclusive, interactive HoleVue system, with Zoom 
o	Complete with digital scorecard  
o	Automatic statistic tracking synching to ClubSG<p>Now, we all know that us golfers kind of have a penchant for gadgets, and therefore a lack of hesitancy when it comes to adopting an out with the old, in with the new mind-set when theres something new on the market that we just have to have. It is for this reason that you might adopt a bit of a passive attitude to the Skycaddie SGX, especially if you havent long purchased its predecessor, the Skycaddie SG5. The fact of the matter is though, that the SGX goes way beyond an Apple-style, barely warrantable update, and does offer some important improvements that justify its new place as golfs numero uno GPS system. Here are the vital statistics that prove the SGX to be a genuine upgrade on the SG5:<p>o	AutoView technology, allowing the user to adjust the screen with a simple turn of the wrist
o	Larger, higher resolution display
o	Dual navigation, allowing for one-handed operation
o	TruePoint, high performance GPS engine<p>These features, added to the fact that the Skycaddie SGX is up there with the iPhone in terms of looks, makes the decision to upgrade almost a non-decision. If they dont have them in your local pro-shop then you might want to phone around and go on a little reconnaissance to your nearest stockists, because it isnt until youve actually seen one, held it, and given it a try, that you realise just how desirous a peace of golfing equipment you are dealing with here. If you are buying it on behalf of someone for Christmas, then youll know as soon as you see it that he or she is going to love you forever.<p>Of course the final plus which makes the Skycaddie SGX the best golf GPS is the fact that pretty much everyone who has used it so far has been posting drastically lower scores. And this isnt just the people who have gone from using no GPS at all to using the SGX. This is people who were previously using the SG5, or a piece of equipment on offer from one of the other golf GPS manufacturers. This speaks volumes for just how good this thing really is. If you are a golfer this Christmas, or you are buying a present for one, then the only true option is the Skycaddie SGX.",1319550633
3154027,comment,3153589,3153943,1,0,manuscreationis,,,"Thats actually a different approach than how I had been doing it - i had been loading a hidden spritesheet by grabbing it from the dom (this is all just prototypal, playing around with canvas code, nothing ""production"" quality mind you), then keeping track of the position in memory and iterating through the frames using the overload of drawImage that lets you specify a slice of the image as what you want to draw.<p>I wasn't even aware of using background-image-position as a way to do this... I'll stick that one in my cap, thanks!<p>I'd say the main benefit of spritesheets as i've seen it would be what you've already commented on: Fewer GETs against the server (when you're thinking in terms of scale, for a large project with lots of assets, i'd say this becomes important, but of course that's a fairly subjective metric), as well as organization of files.<p>You could go with naming conventions... but then for a 45 frame animation, you have 45 distinct files all named something like ""SPECIFIC_ANIMATION_FRAME_X"", as opposed to using a dynamic approach, utilizing the cell-size of the frames and the width and height of the image overall, to calculate the frames on the fly; To me, that is far more maintainable than a huge pile of aptly named images.<p>You could make the claim that calculating out the frame each time is wasted cpu cycles that could be spent elsewhere, but I feel like it's the right approach.<p>But that could just be my opinion. I would love for someone to weigh in with actual metrics on whether or not using a dynamic approach is actually faster or slower in a meaningful way than a brute-force style naming convention animation system.",1319550616

Not being a hacker I have to be really careful where to put my dev money, so any automation I might want to do I have to figure out ways to do it without involving the devs (that money goes to the service I'm building)<p>I have a combination of processes:<p>1. User must fill out a form with their name and email in order to get the download link. For this I use Madmimi.com.<p>2. I have setup a drip campaign. Basically what happens is that once my users confirm their email, Madmimi automatically sends out and email with an welcome text and the download links (the benefit here is obvious: I have the users email and I now have statistics about click rates on the link)<p>3. This drip campaign has two additional emails. One in 15 days and another in 30 days (after the signup).<p>The 15 days after sign up email, basically ask how's everything is doing and contains a link to a quick survey about the whole experience so far (I use Wufoo). Is a guided survey with close question.<p>The 30 days after sign up email is an open question about how they feel with the app. What does it mean to them, etc.<p>Also, my app sends me a log every-time the user uses it for the first time (here is where I haven't been able to do a full integration)<p>What I do is:
I receive this log that contain the users email and some data about the usage. At that moment I fire up my email client and write a welcome email. This is a personal email from me to my user. I thank them, give them all my contact info and basically say: I'm here for you 24/7 (to this day no user has ever waited more than two hours to hear from me when they write) and I keep that promise.<p>Most of the time, the emails I get are basically about the same and my answers are very much alike.<p>To manage this and to be able to give it a personal touch, I installed TextExpander on my Mac and have setup several templates that contain most of my answers but not the full answer. This forces me to read what I'm writing and actually personalize it a bit.<p>This method, while not perfect has brought incredible benefits for my startup:<p>One client was having some issues with the app and my response was fo fast and so helpful that he could not believe it. Turned out the guy was a radio dj and had a show about entrepreneurship. We did a two hour radio interview.<p>Another client is actively pushing my app to his clients because of the customer support I gave him the first days he used the app. He was having some issues (all created by him) and I dedicated 6 hours to help this client. He is now one of my most active evangelist.<p>It pays, big time, to do customer support with passion. Let your users feel it and they will reward you for it.",1319549181

3153917,comment,3151751,3152840,1,0,jules,,,"If you want to learn Lisp from a more practical perspective, you should probably learn Racket or Clojure. Racket comes with excellent tutorials and documentation as well as an IDE with debugging, REPL, etc. You can read How to Design Programs to learn the basics of Racket (Racket started out as Scheme and still contains an implementation of standard Scheme). Clojure is an even more practice oriented Lisp. It is a bit harder to set up and get started with, but there are books on Clojure, e.g. Programming Clojure and The Joy of Clojure. Compared to Clojure, Racket is a bit more academic and has many advanced language features like contracts and first class modules, but is also has a good standard library. Clojure's strong points are functional data structures, concurrency and using generic operations (meaning that you don't end up with vector-ref and list-ref and hash-ref, but just a single function to index into anything). Clojure's syntax is also a bit terser.<p>If you then decide you want to learn Lisp more deeply:<p>How to Design Programs is a book that teaches basic Scheme programming. It is oriented towards beginners, so if you want to understand recursion, higher order functions and data structures this book is for you.

The ""Eat Out site was designed and built by award-winning digital agency Clock Limited. Following on from the delivery of SunPerks.co.uk, Clock developed the entire site using new technology, Node.js.<p>Much like LinkedIn's app overhaul, what's on the surface may not be that spectacular to most but what's fuelling the engine underneath is extremely exciting for techies. The site has been built with extremely young technology, barely a year old, and enables far more utilisation of servers and hardware than ever before; cutting server down-time and boosting response rates. This is down to the much fabled Node.js; a Joyent-sponsored, server-side technology which is rapidly accruing attention in the web-development world.<p>For News International, Clock Limited also built the parent loyalty website mytimesplus.co.uk , which has been received extremely well by its new and existing members. The 'Eat Out' card will be available initially as an exclusive benefit for Times and Sunday Times subscribers and will then be rolled out as a standalone product similar to Taste and Gourmet Society in early 2012. The card will be sold for approximately 50 but remains as a complimentary benefit to Times+ members (subscribers of the two newspapers). And by joining Eat Out, members will be able to take advantage of a range of great dining offers throughout the year at more than 700 top restaurants across the UK.<p>Andrew Sharland, Clock Limiteds Business Director, said: The industry is rapidly evolving and News International are clear market leaders in the monetisation and access of their content. Matching this, weve used cutting-edge technology for the new service so its great to be on-board with such a courageous and innovative approach.<p>Jo Coughlin, Head of Partnerships, The Times and Sunday Times, said: The Eat Out Card is a new and innovative value offering from The Times and The Sunday Times. This is our biggest and best dining offer yet which will see members making huge savings eating out at their favourite restaurants all year round.
As we value our loyal customers the most, we are offering this exciting new benefit as an ongoing addition to the subscription pack via Times+.<p>Paul Serby, CTO of Clock Limited discusses the decision to use Node.js and the team's transition from PHP. The decision to migrate, particularly on such a big project, was because of previous difficulties with PHP memory allocation, where our developers often found scaling hard as memory is quickly exasperated.<p>The critical element about node, which is too often glazed over, is that it harmonises three platforms, allowing one language for browsers, apps and databases all written in JavaScript. So it's no longer a case of PHP for web, JavaScript for apps and SQL for databases. It's one set of tools, one development process and crucially, one skill for people to learn. This implementation for Eat Out is one of the most important to date as the developers are monitoring how well Node performs not just on a virtual server but actually out there ""in the wild. The site's results will be strong indicators of the shape node will begin to take in a commercial industry and how it can be adopted.<p>Times and Sunday Times subscribers can make the most of this new benefit by going to mytimesplus.co.uk
Restaurants can join the scheme by contacting Iain on eatoutcard@newsint.co.uk<p>www.clock.co.uk

3153886,comment,3148106,3149079,1,0,dalke,,,"I read that essay. I don't believe it, or rather, I think it exaggerates what it meant to study a field. I'll base my view on what ""1st year calculus"" means. (Do note that my high school in Miami offered matrix algebra and differential equations, so I see ""1st year calculus"" as being a bit basic for what a high school might offer.)<p>I know that in the 1800s few schools taught the calculus we now call ""calculus."" Back then that term was used for many fields of math, including logic (""the propositional calculus""). Nowadays it's almost only applied to differential and integral calculus. The rigorous foundations of calculus were only laid starting in the mid-1800s, so I seriously doubt that any ""backwoods"" student would have been doing anything remotely like / proofs then; that being the basis for our modern understanding of calculus. It might also have been that ""1st year calculus"" is what we now call ""pre-calculus.""<p>That's not saying it's impossible. Here's an example book on calculus from De Morgan in the early 1800s:  <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=zA4TAQAAMAAJ&ots=iIzsblNu3F&dq=calculus&lr&pg=PA38#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=zA4TAQAAMAAJ&ots=iIzsbl...</a> . This is from a book series meant for adults/non-researchers interested in learning more about the latest science. You can see it has a more geometric approach. I find fascinating the footnote remarking the lack of consensus on how to use the integral sign. The comment on page 52 is telling:<p><pre><code>    There is then in this method neither the rigor of geometry, nor that approach to truth, which, in the method of Leibnitz, may be carried to any extent we please, short of absolute correctness. We would therefore recommend to the student not to regard any proposition derived from this method as true on that account; for falsehoods, as well as truths, may be derived from it.
</code></pre>
This is quite simply because in 1836 they didn't know how to handle infinities correctly. No modern calculus book would have that phrase, because we do.<p>But let's suppose his father did study differential and integral calculus. That would make him the exception, and not indicative of the average. For evidence: <a href=""http://pballew.net/mathbooks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pballew.net/mathbooks</a> describes math education in the US and mentions that in 1871 for the University of Nebraska in Lincoln:<p><pre><code>    ""It was early accepted that mathematics, in particular calculus, would not be a required study for all students. In the first University Catalog it is noted that ""Surgery and Calculus are not required of students in the Classical course."" Exemptions from other mathematics were soon included.""
</code></pre>
I also read in ""The calculus for engineers and physicists"" Griffin 1897 this line ""...methods of cheating the student into using the Calculus without his knowing that he is doing so..."" which tells me that calculus wasn't that common in 1897 either.<p>I could apply the same questions to what ""geology"" means. Here's a textbook from the latter part of the 1800s. It goes into detail about all sorts of different rocks, where they are found how they are use commercially, and so on. It describes land forms. But what of geological processes? Nothing - because we hadn't figured it out yet! It says that folded strata probably come from cooling of the earth's ""heated nucleus."" In the section ""Drift or Boulder Period"" it notes what we now say is evidence of the Ice Age, but which then was a curious unknown ""produced by Icebergs, Glaciers, or both."" They didn't know if it was ice covering the surface, or if the land submerged and icebergs came.<p>They certainly didn't know about continental drift.<p>So the geology of the 1800s would have been quite different from the ""earth science"" I learned in school.",1319547602

Prices went way up.  Then Molycorp got the old Mountain Pass, CA mine going again, with environmental controls even the Sierra Club says are OK.  Now prices are back down, Molycorp is producing at a loss, and a big Australian mine is starting up.[1][2]<p>There&#x27;s also been progress in making motor magnets with smaller amounts of rare earths, which has cut demand.[3][4]<p>So today we need less, there are more sources, and the technology to solve the waste problem from production is working. This is now a non-problem.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-22/rare-earth-miners-face-tough-market/6786970"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-22/rare-earth-miners-face...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelkanellos/2015/06/26/three-lessons-from-the-woeful-tale-of-molycorp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelkanellos/2015/06/26/three...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/NEWS/2012/_STORY/121120-02-e.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/NEWS/2012/_STORY/121120-02-e...</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://www.ims.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Session7a_01_Mikami_Hiroyuki_Technologies_to_replace_rare_earth_elements.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ims.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Session7a_01_M...</a>",1448866793

10648173,comment,10644373,10644373,0,0,jon-wood,,,"Most of the responses here seem to be from the perspective of people in their twenties without any major commitments other than work, so for the sake of balance I&#x27;ll throw my two cents in.<p>I&#x27;m in my thirties, married with a two year old son, and working 40-50 hour weeks for a startup, and spend all day Saturdays looking after our son so my wife has time to work on her PhD. Between that lot there&#x27;s not a lot of spare time, but I&#x27;m also in the process of starting a side project I hope to grow into a business.<p>Recently I&#x27;ve finally managed to get a bit of momentum behind that. The key was to book a week of holiday from work, with the intention of building an MVP during that time. I didn&#x27;t quite get to something I feel I could sell in that time, but I did make enough progress that I feel like its worth continuing.<p>The other thing that&#x27;s working to my advantage is having moved house to be closer to our families. That means I now have 10 hours of train journeys a week over the two days I need to be in the office rather than working from home. Its not an ideal situation to work in, the internet connection is intermittent while traveling through the countryside, and sometimes I&#x27;ll lose 30-40 minutes waiting for their to be a seat, but it does have the advantage of being a block of time that I can dedicate to it. You can get a surprising amount done in two hours when you focus on it. I&#x27;d go so far as to say if you can&#x27;t make time outside of work, move two hours away from the office, and buy yourself an annual train ticket. Maybe I&#x27;ll turn it into some sort of coworking movement, bringing together commute hackers.<p>The other key thing has been to try and notice when I&#x27;m wasting time, and to back out fast. There&#x27;s no leeway for yakk shaving away four hours when that&#x27;s half the time you have to work on something this week. I will say I have mixed success on that front, having recently lost a week to the decision I should stop using Bootstrap. Eventually I killed that branch, and got back to focusing on what matters, but it was super painful.<p>Finally, and the critical thing for me at least, is having a side project you truly care about. If you just feel like you should be working on a side project for appearance sake you&#x27;ll never find the motivation to stick at it. My Github profile can attest to that, with a steady stream of things I spent a few hours on and then got bored of.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear from anyone in a similar situation, and maybe start a mailing list of people who want to support each other. If that&#x27;s something that interests you, my email address is in my profile.",1448866553

So employing 500 good software developers will probably run you at least $100 million.

Anything bigger will make you feel overwhelmed. Also be prepared to sacrifice some personal time for your project, it&#x27;s a hobby anyway.<p>I&#x27;m assuming that your side project has little in common with your main job, otherwise there is no fun in doing it. If that&#x27;s the case, I find it especially useful if the side project can, in a way, contribute to the main project. E.g. you experiment things you want to learn with side project, and apply it into your main project some time in the future. This way you have a good cycle and motivation to keep innovating/experimenting. Making your code/project public so others can use/contribute is also a good motivation to keep it up.",1448866350

We need both carbon neutral technology now as well as carbon capture in the future. However it is an order of magnitude or more easier to not emit now than it is to capture in the future, so we absolutely mush transition to carbon neutral as soon as possible, then use excess intermittent renewable energy to capture co2 from the air. We also need to incentivize that with carbon credits of some sort so that there are market forces.<p>That&#x27;s what Paris is about, and why we need to be pushing our US politicians to ask for much more than what the Obama administration is going to ask for.

It&#x27;ll be interesting to see what happens there.<p>That said, the manifest of permissions idea is fundamentally broken in at least two related ways:<p>1) Most users have no rational basis on which to decide whether to grant the permission or not.  In fact, I would argue this is all users, due to issue #2:<p>2) The permissions are either overbroad, such that pretty much any app that wants to do anything interesting asks for them (this is the &quot;all my apps on want to be able to read my contacts and browsing history&quot; syndrome) or there are so many of them that the list becomes way longer than any user would ever read at install time.<p>You example of a permission for opening arbitrary TCP sockets is an excellent case in point.  As a standalone permission, what fraction of users do you think would understand what is actually being granted?  Even if you restrict to computer professionals, I suspect that most would not understand the implications without a somewhat lengthy explanation of what the permission actually allows.  And even then, in practice it would be rolled into some other more broad permission that would likewise not indicate the security implications of granting it.<p><a href=""http://robert.ocallahan.org/2011/06/permissions-for-web-applications_30.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robert.ocallahan.org/2011/06/permissions-for-web-appl...</a> has some more in-depth discussion of the issues with this model.<p>> Native apps already ask for permissions when installed<p>Yes, and in practice everyone just grants whatever permissions are asked for without really even reading.",1448865440

Developing something based on your own idea is the most risky way of doing anything.<p>Rather that focusing on your own ideas, focus on other people&#x27;s problems, then figure out how to get paid to solve them.<p>Reduce your bottom line agressively to maximise the chances you can sustain yourself without taking up all your time.<p>Solve problems and get paid to do it, then systemise that and get other people to do the work. Now you have a business that doesn&#x27;t take up all your time, but which takes care of your basic income requirements.<p>You can choose to spin a product off based on that, ie. by automating that business and selling it as a product, or you could use a product extension of that business to increase revenue, or you could just work on something completely tangential.",1448864360

Creating those tools is not the job of a lone developer. The cost is immense. The language first has to achieve popularity to receive the tooling, or be heavily backed by a large tooling capable company (eg, Google, Jetbrains, Microsoft). So far, the only recent languages to receive the kind of required static tooling are from those 3 companies. Also note that the language did not come first in those cases - the requirement for the language came first, and a language was made to fit what was needed.<p>However even more importantly - if you&#x27;re going to create a language, it needs to be the ultimate language in your own eyes. You can&#x27;t leave off novel features that you have experience in because it doesn&#x27;t have mass appeal or has tooling issues. You need to create the best language you possibly can if you want to compete with others trying to create the best language. Hamstringing your enjoyment of the language by going in a direction you don&#x27;t like because it has more apparently mass market appeal isn&#x27;t any more likely to be successful, and it certainly isn&#x27;t going to be enjoyable enough for you to slog through the tiny complexities.<p>While there is a tiny chance that your language becomes the next big thing, it probably won&#x27;t. That means you need to make the language you want to make and hope it succeeds, not make the language that &#x27;will succeed&#x27; but you don&#x27;t want to make.",1448864303

The post mentions networking and just doing everything you can to increase your chances of meeting clients. That makes perfect sense, but are there any other insights or good practices?<p>For example, is it good to be a little bit forward and make sure people know you&#x27;re a consultant looking for projects?  Are certain kinds of networking better than others?  Have you ever done any kind of out-bound marketing, or even cold-called potential clients?  What about rules of thumb for whether or not to take on a project (e.g. better to turn down small things and wait for something big, or better to just take anything and everything, or certain kinds of clients you avoid)?<p>I would imagine that with all of this stuff you kind of just have to use your judgement. I also would suspect that everything gets much easier once you&#x27;ve been doing been doing it for longer and have a proven track record and even start to get referrals from previous clients.  That said, it seems like getting the ball rolling with finding work must be one of the hardest aspects of starting out as a consultant.",1448864278

It may be that those things are more important to you, or it may be that you are avoiding other issues.<p>For me, the challenge in understanding my own choices, is understanding the root of those choices. It can help if you have a neutral third party to talk to about why you choose to do X rather than Y, but barring that there are other techniques you can use.<p>One is to make an appointment to spend 1 hr a week on some project. When I do this I start with a fresh notebook and pick a time either before I go, or after I get home, from the office to spend on this project. Then when the time comes the first hour is dedicated to writing down in the notebook the goal of what I&#x27;m trying to do, why I&#x27;m trying to do it, and the things that will have to be true before I can achieve that goal. After an hour I close the notebook and go about my life. The only rule is that during that hour I work on the project and nothing else, and if unavoidedly interrupted I make up the time lost that same day.<p>The things that make that possible are; It is only an hour, same as watching a TV show or reading through the front page, the notebook retains my mental state between sessions so I don&#x27;t start out wondering what the heck I was doing last week and what needed to be done.<p>I found that for me what I really hated was spending an hour coming up to speed on a project and then only having a few minutes to work on it. Very unproductive and very demotivating. But with a process to stop and restart a project in hand, it takes away the restart lag and so I can be productive nearly right away (perhaps 10 minutes reviewing my closing notes from the previous session). Also if my check list is good then I have a good idea of how close I am to the goal.<p>Time is a finite resource, and learning to budget it will serve you well throughout your career.",1448863960

The modern systems all check with light beams for proper positioning, but it&#x27;s better if there are also physical obstacles.<p>There are palletless systems, where rows of rails rise up under the wheels and lift the car for transport, but those seem to be less popular.<p>The better designs have more than one retrieval mechanism that can access each slot, so if one fails, the system can still operate, but more slowly.<p>The lifts have to have the usual safety devices of a freight elevator. There is no excuse for an elevator falling, which has happened.<p>The usual problems of exposed machinery apply. Everything has to be built for a wet, hostile environment. Optical sensors must survive dirt.  Limit switches must survive being banged on.  Motors must be weatherproof. Some of these parking systems are repurposed automated warehouse designs, and that&#x27;s a marginal approach. You want someone on the design team who&#x27;s designed for a harsh environment, like railroading. \n &quot;Move fast and break things&quot; will not work.",1448863349

10648022,comment,10644373,10644373,0,0,halite,,,"It definitely is difficult. No doubt about it. Here are few things you need to remember (or things that helped me):<p>1: Break down your ideas into smaller ship-able chunks<p>2: Once you&#x27;ve something presentable, start getting market feedback to see if it would make sense going all in<p>3: If you don&#x27;t see much interest, don&#x27;t give up hope, sometimes it is better communication sometimes pivoting required. This is where you&#x27;d decide where you&#x27;d like to go. I found reddit to be tremendously helpful in getting feedback.<p>4: This probably is special case for me but I was giving up on software and getting little depressed / overwhelmed with my current stage in life. I like to do artsy stuff once in a while and so I started getsatvik.com, no-one has bought anything yet but this helps me learn marketing, copywriting and understanding how to sell. So think what you&#x27;d like to do as a hobby maybe combining that with your ideas could keep you going.<p>5: I find teaching people is also a great motivator. I now run a regular meetup in my city, learn some new concepts every month, teach them to other people. I don&#x27;t get paid for any of this but helps to keep me sane.<p>6: Sometimes having virtual buddies also help. I now have a &#x27;friend&#x27; on reddit who helps me with quick feedback / writing critique (as English isn&#x27;t my first language) and I help him with doing some programming / teaching.<p>7: Nothing new or revolutionary here but sometimes connecting with like-minded individuals and organizing an accountability group also helps. If you&#x27;d like to connect, I&#x27;m happy to be your virtual-buddy!",1448863290
10648021,comment,10644373,10647725,0,0,jqm,,,"Ya, but you could do that little bit of stuff in less time then it took to write up the spec, put up the work, sift through potential contractors and ensure what you got met your needs (going back to step 2 when it didn&#x27;t). Plus you would know how it fit together since you wrote it so it would be somewhat easy to alter/reuse.<p>As far as side projects, 40 hours a week to work isn&#x27;t that much. I usually work 50+ and have most of my work life. Lots of people work even more. If you did this you would have at least ten hours a week to work on a side project. Incidentally, I still have spare time. To do things like post this comment. What are you doing with your spare time? Video games? Movies? Facebook? Might be worth looking at. Life is short and you don&#x27;t get time back.<p>Start small. Do a little project. Something that takes 8 or 10 hours. Then, with that under your belt tackle something bigger.",1448863287

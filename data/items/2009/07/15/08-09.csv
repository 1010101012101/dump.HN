705395,comment,705095,705363,0,0,blasdel,,,"My fundamental beef with Apache is that people wrap <i>way</i> too much functionality into it, to the point where their entire end-to-end web stack is two sets of processes: Apache and a database server.<p>On top of that it's configuration is awful, the modules are all awful compared to their domain-specific alternatives, the architecture is awful (especially wrt concurrency), the development process is molasses, and the Apache Software Foundation has all but abandoned httpd for IBM-focused all-Java astronaut architecture with as much bureaucracy as they can possibly fit into a public process.<p>I hate Apache because I'm <i>intimately</i> familiar with how the web works, and the ASF is responsible for so much web-hostile WS-* garbage.<p>For a while (~4 years ago) I thought lighttpd was worthwhile as a total replacement, and did a project that hacked it's WebDAV implementation for userspace filesystems (pre-MacFUSE), but fundamentally its architecture is still Apache just with sensible concurrency.<p>I've come to be really fond of the reverse-proxy model, and really like Nginx running in front of independent app processes using whatever HTTP abstraction is native to the language (WSGI, Rack, Servlets, etc.) along with a nice native high-level spec-focused HTTP server (twisted.web, mongrel, ???). The last web application I wrote from scratch was on Google AppEngine, and I <i>really</i> like their version of WSGI.",1247648169

705358,comment,705258,705269,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I’ve been going over this in my mind and this is what I’ve come up with.<p>On one hand you can look at it as a straight theft.  If a person steals a bunch of computers and then sells them to a computer shop for 25% of the retail price the shop owner is guilty of a crime (selling stolen goods) even if he had no part in the initial theft.  In that case I’d say it’s immoral on Techcrunch’s part.  Because while the digital copies of files don’t have monetary value like physical computers they have intellectual property value that could do significant damage to Twitter and in doing so cause the company to lose large sums of money.<p>ON THE OTHER HAND, most of the great scandals both in Government and in Corporate America have been revealed by whistle blowers who essentially stole documents and passed them on to reporters.  So there’s a precedent where stealing documents can actually be a very moral thing.<p>In the end I think it boils down to what the documents reveal.  In the case of whistle blowers they're still stealing something but we forgive the theft because it’s done to protect society from a greater harm.  The good out weighs the bad.  So if these documents reveal some  kind of malfeasants on Twitter’s part I could see publishing them as being justified.  If not I think you’re probably right and this is an immoral act on Techcrunch’s part.",1247645224

So could someone enlighten me on what else do they offer? Because it seems search is only feature I hear about...<p>I can't remember the name of the company, but there was another company that created a better search for Outlook, Microsoft bought them out, made the better search crappy again.<p>So my guess is that Microsoft has no incentive to make search good on desktops.

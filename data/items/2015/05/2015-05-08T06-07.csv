Are you saying one of the following is true?<p>(1) You are saying for any program M that uses state (i.e. M&#x27;s type mentions the state monad in an essential way) but in a pure way, i.e. M&#x27;s stateful behaviour is not visible from the outside, there is a context C[.] (not involving tricks like UnsafeIO) such that C[M] has the same behaviour as M (as seen from the outside), and C[M] has (essentially) the same type  as M, except that the state monad is gone?<p>(2) There is a &#x27;nice&#x27; translation function f on programs such that for any
 program M that uses state  in a pure way (same as (1)), f(M) has the same behaviour as M (as
 seen from the outside), and f(M) has (essentially) the same type as
 M, except that the state monad is gone?",1431068357

They can be used in the way you describe, but that&#x27;s not their typical usage.<p>AR/Django encourage you to describe your entire schema, _including_ the relationships between tables, as attributes on your model objects.  Upon doing this, you get simple and reliable programmatic access to some basic access and storage patterns.<p>Using this knowledge of your data model, the ORM can now provide you with more advanced tools:  it can automatically join across tables (`select_related`), lazily load dependent data[1], generate SQL schema for you, transparently cache queries[2], automatically provide HTML form validators, and even automate database schema migration for you.  The more completely you model the system, the more it can do for you.<p>In these systems, the <i>database is subservient to the model</i>.  This is a problem, because the database is <i>reality</i> and the model is a <i>model</i>.<p>Dropping to &quot;opaque SQL strings&quot; is discouraged, both because it&#x27;s considered error prone (&quot;You should leave SQL to the professionals!  There are lots of eyes on this!&quot;) and because there is often no graceful way to integrate custom query code with your model layer;  instead,  you investigate how to do so within the confines of the ORM.  For every case where you can eventually find what you need (`select_related(&quot;user__friends__email&quot;)`), there are a dozen where you can&#x27;t.<p>People start writing things in application code that could be handled easily and more efficiently by the database:  aggregations are a classic, since ORMs support is either missing or incredibly complex.  As soon as the application becomes non-trivial[3], the problems magnify.  They don&#x27;t do this because they are stupid, or bad developers, they do this because it&#x27;s what the tools encourage:  they encourage simplistic CRUD access and mistrust/suspicion/fear of SQL.<p>SQLAlchemy is quite different from this, because its primary focus is to model databases, not to provide some kind of declarative object language with its own set of semantics that do not exist in SQL.<p>Because Go can&#x27;t do things like meta classes or creating/modifying types at runtime, a lot of this simply isn&#x27;t there, even though people want it.<p>Sqlx does like 2 things;  it adds named query parameter support, and it marshals rows into structs.  Squirrel is just a query builder.  The whole philosophy that the database must somehow be modeled and that access to the database is done via that model is absent.<p>[1] This is especially durable tarmac with which to pave your road to hell.<p>[2] <a href=""http://github.com/jmoiron/johnny-cache"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/jmoiron/johnny-cache</a><p>[3] This can mean &quot;lots of requests&quot;, or &quot;complex schema&quot;, or &quot;complex reporting requirements&quot;...  all sorts of things.",1431067136

Since California is one of the only places in the world with carpool lanes, the studies mainly come from CA universities. Their studies point to a negative effect of carpool lanes on traffic in almost all traffic scenarios, because they are underutilized. Coupled with the fact that they add only negative value for every car that can access them without changing driving habits, there is a reason they have not caught on more widely.

For my life, such goals provide a very positive counterbalance to the intense focus I give to my career and tech, during all of my other waking hours.<p>So, with this group of friends, we went on an outing to a weekend music festival. My friend got word of a shared AirBnb for the weekend, through another of his friend circles. We both joined in on the AirBnb, and it&#x27;s there that I met my SO. They ended up being my friends&#x27;s friend&#x27;s roommate&#x27;s girlfriend&#x27;s friend.<p>Meeting people is tough and, in a way, its own full-time job. It&#x27;s another job to actively date. My top suggestions are:
* look to see if your college has an active alumni group, locally. if so, attend events with them (sports tailgates, cookouts, etc).
* go to Meetups that interest you. go to many, and go often.
* join a kickball, dodgeball, rock climbing, soccer, or any other group sport.<p>Continue to put forth a significant effort towards these things for 1-2 years and I promise you&#x27;ll develop a solid friend circle. It&#x27;s a hard process and you&#x27;ll have to learn to constantly meet and interact with scores of people you simply don&#x27;t mesh with, until you find the rare few people that you click really well with. Stay optimistic. As a general rule, don&#x27;t say &#x27;no&#x27; to any invitation you&#x27;re given.<p>If you&#x27;re single, I&#x27;d encourage you to meet other single friends that you can go &#x27;be single&#x27; with (i.e. go to bars, clubs, dating and other social events to, with the intent of meeting people who may turn into an SO).<p>After that, it&#x27;s usually a matter of time and lots of fun with your friends, until you meet an SO.

You could instead have a conditional in the function that produces the right closure based on mode rather than constantly re-checking mode every single time you call the closure.<p>Also, maybe it would be worth discussing building temporary function variables in outer scope that resolve the methods before the closure is called (i.e. my_list_append = my_list.append). There was no opportunity to do this in example, but it&#x27;s worth discussing.<p>Finally, dict access seems like a bad idea if you&#x27;re this pressed for performance, especially since you only need one value -- maybe better just to encourage explicitly passing in a parameter.",1431065230

9510204,comment,9505377,9508385,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I use both a tiling window manager (xmonad) and tmux.  The main reason I started using tmux was to do pair programming sharing the same terminal via ssh.  If you pair program and have never tried this before, I highly recommend trying it.  I live in Japan and even pair with people in London using tmux and vim.  It&#x27;s the next best thing to being there.<p>After I started getting used to using tmux, I found that my workflow naturally separated between things I&#x27;m doing on my terminal and things that require X (like my browser).  These days I use a separate workspace for X apps and terminal (occasionally moving them around).<p>To make my life easy, I&#x27;ve added xmonad-like key bindings and window layout to tmux.  Since other people are sharing:<p><a href=""https://github.com/ygt-mikekchar/dotfiles/blob/taka/home/.tmux.conf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ygt-mikekchar/dotfiles/blob/taka/home/.tm...</a><p>I often work while travelling and when I&#x27;m on the road I often don&#x27;t bother cranking up X -- just work in the Linux console.

Church, park, gym, library, farmers market, meetups, coffee shops, sporting events, etc.<p>The second step, as others have said, is you have to put yourself out there and talk to people. Not in the sense of hitting on someone or asking for a date. Just talk to people and create some new relationships. It can be hard for some people (it was for me), but you&#x27;ll find it really enriches your life.<p>Keep it simple to start. Choose a treadmill next to someone at the gym and say &quot;hello&quot;.

Some shops are worse than others, though.<p>My advice is: find a busy shop with regular customers. Make friends with the baristas, and hang out near the bar when it&#x27;s busy. Talk to the baristas - most will welcome this (I&#x27;m a former barista. Conversation with customers makes the day go by faster. If the baristas don&#x27;t want to talk, find another shop.) You will inevitably be pulled into conversations with other customers by hanging out at the bar. It&#x27;s like a conveyor belt of ever changing personalities. Eventually, people will ask you to socialize outside of the coffee shop. Success.<p>This always works. I&#x27;ve done it a number of times. When I go to a new place and don&#x27;t know anyone, I find a coffee shop.<p>also: make sure you go on weekends - people are more willing to relax and talk when it&#x27;s not during the workweek.",1431065047

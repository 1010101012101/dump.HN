8382850,comment,8381279,8382503,9,0,coriny,,,"&quot;I think by far the most twisted notion in the article is the idea that little changed between 1913 and 1967. I&#x27;m pretty sure technological change during that period had more impact on the average Westerner&#x27;s life than any other 54 year time span in history. It takes a very peculiar world view to completely ignore the invention of television or to consider a biplane as being basically equivalent to a jumbo jet.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not what it says at all. He states that the 60s economy is still dominated by technologies that pre-date 1913. He even specifically cites the economically dominant technologies, instead of the vague assertion, &quot;I&#x27;m pretty sure ...&quot;. He particularly notes aeroplanes and computers as being invented during that period and can be expected to have enormous economic impact. Which they did, but hadn&#x27;t by that point. The same with television.<p>Looking at the rest of your comment, I kind of think you should delete and reread the article. Every criticism is incorrect or unsupported - like the MIT crack. He&#x27;s clearly talking about the &quot;thin client&quot; approach to providing computing - he was wrong, but it was not an unreasonable supposition to make.",1411999006

My average used to be 10 (it&#x27;s 4.5 now), and this meant that I could comment on a thread and it would essentially always be the top comment, even if it only had 1 point and the comments below had more.<p>This created a positive feedback loop - because the top comments get read more, they also get voted up more (as long as they&#x27;re not blatant trolls/spam). So once you had an average of about 6 or more, it was very easy to maintain and rack up points.<p>They seem to have changed the algorithm them - I remember when they did it, because I noticed the effects almost immediately (not just on my own account, but on others&#x27; accounts, like tptacek and tokenadult).<p>Overall, this is probably a change for the better, since it mitigates the &quot;rich get richer&quot; effect of commenting frequently while still rewarding people who consistently contribute valuable comments.",1411998365

In fact there&#x27;s a whole suite of products out there serving it.<p>At the base level you have DIY solutions (small LCD&#x27;s, e-ink etc) which are loads of fun to build and can work quite nicely for some scenarios.<p>Another option that a lot of buildings are starting to use is iOS / Android apps along with a device in a wall mount (<a href=""https://eventboard.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://eventboard.io/</a> et al). Cheap (ish), easily replaceable and upgradeable hardware and apps that are quite affordable.<p>From here you then move into more dedicated devices which also provide some deeper integration with the environment. Traditionally this has something that has been handled by the AV world with products such as AMX&#x27;s (<a href=""http://amx.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amx.com/</a>) RMS or Crestron&#x27;s (<a href=""http://www.crestron.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crestron.com/</a>) RoomView, however there&#x27;s a bunch of other really exciting players around to like Condeco (<a href=""http://www.condecosoftware.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.condecosoftware.com/</a>) which merit some consideration. Regardless of who&#x27;s providing it, its at this level the tech starts to getting a little more exciting. Generally you begin to tie in with sensors (PIR, seat pressure, signal presence on laptop input etc) inside the room to provide analytics on occupancy, auto cancel meetings when there&#x27;s a no show, integrate with NFC for handling access control or user auth etc. If you coming from the AV side the rest of the room can also start to interact with that booking information to (for example, parsing meeting info for video / teleconference details etc).",1411997938

That is a pretty general statement though. The possibilities to learn something valuable certainly vary by the source.<p>I hope you agree, that skype, that was a great software, has been systematically wrecked by microsoft. It has not only become unusable, it gathers more and more bugs (don&#x27;t start to talk about the MS classics).<p>So MS did not get it in 40 years. You are still in good mood, that they have something valuable to tell about software development? Certainly, there are always new developers. But the culture did not change. Good luck with your hope to still learn something valuable from MS. The chance is just not too high, I guess.\nYes, the author is not the company. But he takes his experience from MS as an example.<p>And, btw., my viewpoint is neither uninformed nor shortsighted. It is pure anger about 40 years of bad software and especially about ruining skype.<p>You one the other hand, assume things of me from 2 lines of comment.

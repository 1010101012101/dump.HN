671883,comment,671832,671832,0,0,noonespecial,,,"<i>The final major problem with brands is loss of trust. Our data shows that the amount of trust consumers place in a brand today is a ghost of what it was 10 years ago.</i><p>I remember the first time I bought a Sony walkman and it performed more poorly than a Sanyo of half the cost, then died completely. I opened it to try to fix it and found inside... all Sanyo parts!<p>The moral: Brands are (or were) more than a marketing gimmick. Putting a sticker on a white label product is not a magical transformation. Customers are not fooled. When someone dials your phone number for help, encasing them in inescapable machine menus, or connecting them to someone on another continent who's never even seen your product is <i>not</i> an acceptable solution. A good brand used to be a promise that this kind of nonsense wouldn't happen; No more, it seems.<p>In short, if you want the return of customer loyalty to a brand, <i>try not sucking</i>.",1245839929

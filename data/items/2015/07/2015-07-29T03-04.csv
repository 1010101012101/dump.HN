I was right-seat in a King Air and heard Center call traffic for us at 1/4 mile, looked once, nothing, turned head in case I might have lost my bearing, looked again and there it was. I felt I could almost read the numbers and ID on the aircraft, that&#x27;s an exaggeration, but it was close. If there hadn&#x27;t also been some altitude separation, we could&#x27;ve been in a lot worse shape because we were under the other A/C&#x27;s nose. Neither myself nor the pilot could see it before it was already very close, and it closed too fast for us to do much because we didn&#x27;t have much energy (climbing spiral with skydivers on board).",1438142229

I once saved enough code in size to include lodash, and eventemitter into the client side of a project, by refactoring out a piece using those two libraries.  I was of course chastised because it took longer than expected.  I left when the writing on the wall was I would be fired anyway...

It can be done, and is actually not as hard as you would think. You can easily buy laptop motherboards, memory, hard drives, on sites like Newegg. Your hard part is going to be finding the case. Due to space constraints you really need a case that is designed to fit the type of motherboard, memory, and drive configuration. I think you would have two options here. The easiest would be to simply buy a case online. The other way would be to find a laptop that you could rip the inside out of and use that casing.

9966051,comment,9965951,9965951,0,0,brownbat,,,"> It feels slightly odd to celebrate [the start menu&#x27;s] return, as it should never have gone away.<p>I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time looking at Fitt&#x27;s Law, then asking myself why I didn&#x27;t like the tiled start screen.<p>I mean, maybe a launcher should take over the entire display for the brief moments it&#x27;s in use. It&#x27;s not a crazy theory...<p>Yet me and my friends couldn&#x27;t get into it.<p>After some long discussions, we realized that most of us had a tiny spasm of psychological panic when we hit the Win key, because it looked like all our work was suddenly gone and we entered a new environment. We didn&#x27;t believe that, of course, but UX is all about subliminal signals the interface sends you faster than you can reason about.<p>Maybe we&#x27;re weird. But if not, the start screen would have worked if it used a transparency effect or only took up 90% of the screen, as if to tell people, &quot;It&#x27;s ok, everything you&#x27;re doing is still here and easy to return to.&quot;<p>Or, on the other hand, maybe big usability shifts are just jarring. Only 6% of Windows users use alt+tab. Maybe for this userbase, UX theory goes out the window, it doesn&#x27;t matter beyond &quot;any change is bad.&quot;<p>Regardless of which reason drove the resentment, a resizable start menu that can expand all the way to a screen? That&#x27;s the most brilliant way to solve all of preferences.<p>If you love Fitt&#x27;s Law, you can have the screen. If you want to avoid panic, you can have a giant menu. If you scan your desktop while launching or even just fear change, you can have a small menu. Default is somewhere between two and three, unless you&#x27;re on a tablet where start screens aren&#x27;t as jarring and make more sense.<p>Everybody wins, and with a stroke of genius: pragmatism without sacrificing the ideals that originally drove the design.",1438141600

9966039,comment,9962603,9965600,0,0,Cogito,,,"What leads you to think that the templates are necessarily very complex?<p>In my reading, the models requires the presence of polymers, let&#x27;s call them <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>T</i>; and a cyclical mechanism that causes these polymers to alternately bind to each other and release each other (through chain to chain ionic or hydrogen bonds).<p>The polymers themselves are formed of chains of smaller monomers covalently bonded to each other.<p><i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>T</i> are floating around, and occasionally bind to each other. The nature of our template <i>T</i> is such that both <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> can bind to it at the same time. Importantly, <i>T</i> doesn&#x27;t need to be much larger, or more complex, than <i>A</i> or <i>B</i>, just able to bind to one of the ends of each.<p>So we have our polymers floating around looking something like (this is my purely made up notation):<p><pre><code>    *A*: AAaAaA   *B*: BbbBbBB
    
    *T*: TTaAabBBT
</code></pre>
They move into the night cycle, causing them to bind to each other with ionic or hydrogen bonds:<p><pre><code>    AAaAaA BbbBbBB
       ||| |||
     TTaAa-bBBT
</code></pre>
Due to the ends of the <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> chains now being so close to each other, they form a covalent bond, resulting in a new polymer chain <i>C</i>:<p><pre><code>    *C*: AAaAaABbbBbBB
            ||||||
          TTaAabBBT
</code></pre>
The day cycle comes around and the template breaks away from the newly created chain.<p>Thus the template is acting like a catalyst, able to create many identical copies of this polymer <i>C</i>. <i>C</i> is a more complex polymer than either <i>A</i> or <i>B</i> and could easily become a template itself.<p>It&#x27;s not much of a stretch to then consider a polymer which either was a template for itself, or was part of a sequence of templates that produced each other.<p>To your complexity point, it doesn&#x27;t seem obvious that these templates are necessarily &quot;fairly complex&quot; - indeed if you admit the existence of polymer chains in the first place the ability for one of them to act as a template seems trivial.",1438141282

Each microcontainer has its own instance of Nginx and PHP-FPM. An Nginx server as a proxy sits on the front end serving connections to one or more sites hosted in the containers. It uses Alpine Linux and persists all data on the host&#x27;s file system. The logging is also available on the host system. The benefit of doing it this way is that each site sits in its own container, so if it is compromised, no harm comes to any other site or services running on the host system.<p>It also does not link containers, instead opting to attach the database to the first IP address of the network Docker sets up, thereby avoiding the need for complicated service discovery.

User-defined macros aren&#x27;t expected to do rlcp diligently; so we compensate for their negligence with rlcp_tree(mac_expand, form). This basically liberally sprinkles the source location of the original form over the nodes of the macro-expansion. It works pretty well in practice, helping to relate errors in macro expansions to the original source. rlcp_tree respects nodes that already have source info; it gives it to those which don&#x27;t have it.<p>Source info is associated with tree nodes using a weak global hash table. When an object with source info attached goes away, the info goes away.<p>Trivial test:<p>macro-error-test.tl:<p><pre><code>   1: (defmacro mac (expr)
   2:   expr)
   3: (mac (/ 1 0))

   $ txr macro-error-test.tl 
   txr: unhandled exception of type numeric-error:
   txr: possibly triggered at macro-error-test.tl:3 by form (/ 1 0)
   txr: message: /: division by zero
</code></pre>
If we change the example to this:<p><pre><code>   1: (defmacro mac (expr)
   2:   (copy expr))
   3: (mac (/ 1 0))
</code></pre>
the error is exactly the same. This time the expr coming out of the macro is a copy and so it has no source info. The macro expander adds it. This is less accurate: the line number of the macro call isn&#x27;t necessarily that of the (/ 1 0). Here it happens to be because it&#x27;s a one-liner expression.<p>Example of an error during macro expansion:<p><pre><code>   1: (defmacro mac (expr)
   2:   (/ 1 0))
   3: (mac foo)

   $ txr macro-error-test-2.tl 
   txr: unhandled exception of type numeric-error:
   txr: possibly triggered at macro-error-test-2.tl:2 by form (/ 1 0)
   txr: during expansion at macro-error-test-2.tl:3 of form (mac (/ 1 0))
   txr: message: /: division by zero</code></pre>",1438139368

I realize that this is incredibly broad (perhaps too much so?). The conventional wisdom is that building your own desktop is cheaper than buying a pre-built workstation, and more practical because you can spec it to exactly your needs and not pay for what you don&#x27;t want. The conventional wisdom with laptops is that it is impractical to put one together on your own, so you&#x27;re stuck paying for whatever comes included with what you need.<p>One thought that occurs to me (but I don&#x27;t want to limit the conversation to just this) would be to hack together a frame around a Raspberry Pi-esque SoC with a screen.

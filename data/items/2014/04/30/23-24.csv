Or consider emergency services whose radios were affected: maybe paramedics were radioing in status updates to a hospital, or perhaps police officers were in the middle of receiving an Amber alert. Or, imagine that he&#x27;s injured in an accident himself. He, and anyone else potentially injured in such an accident, are potentially at risk because people can&#x27;t notify 911. If he&#x27;s lucky, he&#x27;s able to turn it off.

7677291,comment,7674550,7677200,6,0,schoen,,,"I have a feeling that the social context for veganism is extremely different, in a way that can be difficult to imagine, across different social groups (different cities, age cohorts, ethnic groups, social classes, religious backgrounds, etc.).<p>Most of my friends are well-educated secular urban middle-class 30-year-olds who are somewhat left-wing by U.S. standards.  Most of them know dozens of vegetarians and at least several vegans.  On average, they seem to view my veganism somewhere on a spectrum from &quot;mildly eccentric&quot; to &quot;extremely admirable&quot;.<p>When I go to other countries, I&#x27;m more likely to meet people who are surprised that I&#x27;m vegan.  Some of them say that they didn&#x27;t know that that was possible (!) or that they have never met a vegan in person before.<p>I have also met some vegetarians and vegans, mostly from immigrant families, who said that they had to hide their dietary practices from their families because their families would be so upset about it.  (When I went vegetarian 26 years ago, my grandmother expressed a fair amount of concern for my health, although she&#x27;d at least met other vegetarians before.)<p>I think it&#x27;s easy to generalize from our experience about how other people &quot;normally&quot; react to particular dietary practices, but our experiences with people&#x27;s reactions (positive, negative, confused, hostile, indifferent, curious) may be a narrow local view.<p>One time I had a discussion in Latin with a Catholic priest who worked at the Vatican.  (I don&#x27;t speak Italian and he doesn&#x27;t speak English, so Latin was our best common language.)  When he learned that I didn&#x27;t eat animals, he cited Genesis 9:3 as a reason that vegetarianism was faintly ridiculous.  It took me a minute or two to understand that he was absolutely, completely serious.",1398902131
7677290,comment,7676592,7676716,3,0,dalke,,,"I get the sense that most of the article was to highlight the point you just made. That is, while cyclists with helmets may be safer, so are drivers with helmets, etc., so if the argument for cycling helmets is only &quot;you&#x27;ll be safer&quot;, without relative risk information, then it isn&#x27;t that strong an argument.<p>That said, you are correct. A counter-argument based on that logic must include relative risk information, which wasn&#x27;t given. I followed several of the links under &quot;How bike helmets may be harmful&quot;. The author did not characterize some of them correctly.<p>For example, &quot;Three separate studies have shown that bike helmets may increase the probability of certain types of neck injuries.&quot; links to a meta-data study that attempts to draw a conclusion using both positive and negative studies. It&#x27;s wrong to pull out only the negative studies as any sort of evidence, especially when the abstract concludes &quot;...but this result may not be applicable to the lighter helmets currently in use. In conclusion, the evidence is clear that bicycle helmets prevent serious injury and even death. Despite this, the use of helmets is sub-optimal. Helmet use for all riders should be further encouraged to the extent that it is uniformly accepted and analogous to the use of seat belts by motor vehicle occupants.&quot;<p>I also dislike the number of citations to news sources, rather than the primary literature. The University of Bath study links to a press release, and others links to the New York Times.<p>I conclude that this is not an essay I would point people to in order to convince them that the necessity of bicycle helmet use is exaggerated.<p>I&#x27;ve dug into the literature myself before. It&#x27;s murky. That is, while there&#x27;s clear evidence that helmet use can reduce some types of injuries, the incidence of those injuries are low, and one proposed solution - mandatory helmet use - has its own negative effects. I think an anti-mandatory bicycle helmet essay could leave it at that.",1398902121

If you worked with the DHH of three years ago, you&#x27;d get a very different interpretation (slower cycles, integration tests, no isolation) than if you worked with me (faster cycles, integration/unit mix, biased toward isolated unit tests).

I&#x27;m not a historian, but my sense is that absent the death camps and and silly wonder weapons, Germany would have been perhaps 10% or 20% more effective -- not 100% more effective. Stalingrad would probably have wrapped up a bit more quickly -- but Moscow, London, and points beyond would all have become the new Stalingrads. Which would not have been a happier outcome, on the whole.<p>[Edit]: Also, it&#x27;s not entirely clear who would&#x27;ve been the &quot;bad guys&quot; in this alternate-history. The German death camps were certainly the evilest single element of the war -- but the Allied policy of mass-firebombing civilian population centres was arguably the second evilest element of the war, and the Russians were very nearly as nasty as the Nazis to whomever they occupied. Absent the death camps, the moral clarity of that war would have become significantly muddier -- although Germany would certainly still have been the aggressor.",1398901875
7677278,comment,7675680,7676945,1,0,privong,,,"> I agree with this article, but think that by singling out social sciences it fails to reveal the bigger picture: that all scientific fields are subject to these same mistakes.<p>I actually prefer them writing about a single (or a group of related) field(s) of study. There have been lots of articles asserting that all of science has these issues, but it&#x27;s not clear to me that they all suffer to the same degree. For example, It&#x27;s not clear to me that physics or astronomy suffer as from this type of behavior. I&#x27;m sure it does happen, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as pervasive as in the social sciences and medicine. For social sciences it seems like it is happening often enough that it&#x27;s affecting the trajectory of the field. To my knowlege, this isn&#x27;t the case for most of physics and astronomy (for example).<p>Also, a lot (but not all) of the &quot;mistakes&quot; noted in the article were deliberate fabrications or unethical tampering of data.

Even when your project doesn&#x27;t really have any functionality yet, run <i>that</i> one continually in the background. This one test will find so many classes of bugs that you weren&#x27;t expecting - it optimises your tests for learning surprising things as soon as possible. You then start fleshing out your test suite to cover the things you learn. With some smart design, there will be a lot of shared code between your every-growing stress test and the suite of more targeted tests.<p>You might find that you get down to detailed unit tests of every part of the code... but you&#x27;ll probably find that you only need to bother with unit testing obscure conditions for the complicated parts.<p>The core philosophical difference here is that I regard tests as a tool for learning and making the code better, not as a way to make myself feel happier. The biggest performance barrier I experience as a developer is not the seconds it takes to cycle through the tests, it&#x27;s the weeks it takes to learn what I&#x27;m trying to build.

7677149,comment,7672485,7673370,2,0,tzs,,,"DDT spread way too broadly in the ecosystem, to species it had never been tested on, and it persisted a long time. It was known to interfere with critical species such as nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This is not something you want to mess around blindly with, which is what we did by putting DDT into widespread use without adequate testing.<p>There are three effective ways to control insects.<p>1. Poison them with something that is dangerous to a wide variety of life.<p>2. Poison them with something that is narrowly targeted to the species you are trying to control and is harmless to other species.<p>3. Deal with them mechanically, such as by crushing them or tearing them apart.<p>DDT and similar pesticides take the #1 approach. To do that safely you have to carefully control the spread of your pesticide so that it doesn&#x27;t spread to species you do not want to harm. You can do this by being very careful in how it is applied, and designing it to break down quickly and not spread beyond the application area. We failed in this aspect with DDT.<p>The #2 approach is quite feasible. The way it works is that you base your pesticide on hormones of your target species. Insects are essentially biological robots running conceptually simple and very inflexible state machines. Various hormones control this, triggering various programs that run on the state machine. For instance, there might be a particular hormone that activates in the males when the weather changes, triggering in males a flight to find a female, and after that program runs the male dies. A different hormone might trigger female mating behavior.<p>Entomologists can study that species, and identify the various behavior programs built into the insect state machine, and figure out what hormones active which programs. Then a pesticide can be designed that mimics the hormone that starts the male mating subroutine. Spray that on them when it is not the right time of the year, so the females are not having their mating program trigger, and the males will go do their (now futile) mating flight and die.<p>The best part about this is that it is safe for other species, because these program control hormones for one species are almost always harmless to other species up the food chain. (To be up the food chain from something, you kind of need to have evolved to not be bothered by its hormones).<p>Another nice thing about the #2 approach is that the pests do not develop immunity. If an insect develops immunity to, say, the hormone that triggers its mating flight, then it is not going to mate when that trigger fires naturally, and so whatever mutation provided that immunity dies off.<p>The #3 approach is also quite feasible...and no, I don&#x27;t mean importing cheap migrant workers to go out with tweezers in the fields and crush insects. :-) I&#x27;m talking about finding an insect the preys upon or is a parasite to the insect you want to control, and using it. Entomologists can study a pest species and identify what its enemies and parasites are (and there usually are some), and then you can introduce those to control the pest species. Unlike higher forms of like, like reptiles and birds and mammals, insects tend to be very picky about what they prey upon or what they are parasites to. If you&#x27;ve got a particular species of invasive  insect from Florida destroying your California citrus crop, and you import the species of parasitic wasp that kills the pest, when it kills them it does not turn to some other species for hosting services. It dies.<p>The big problem with #2 and #3 is that there are a lot of insect species, and a lot of predator and parasite species, and not a lot of entomologists. This is discussed in the excellent book &quot;Life on a Little Known Planet&quot; by Howard Ensign Evans [1]. He was one of the worlds leading experts on parasitic wasps. There are hundreds or thousands of species of them, most very small (the size of pinhead or smaller). In the book, he tells the story of that pest destroying the California crop. Officials did try to import the parasitic wasp from Florida that kept the pest in control there.<p>It failed. Eventually, after the crop was destroyed, they found out why. It turns out that what was thought to be one species of parasitic wasp was actually two, which are almost identical, except one of them was NOT a parasite for the particular species they were trying to control. With hundreds of species of parasitic wasps and very few parasitic wasp experts in the world, no one had looked at this one species close enough to have noticed that there were really two species.<p>The kind of observation and experimentation is takes to learn enough about the insect state machines to make the hormone mimicking pesticides, or to learn enough about an insect&#x27;s predators or parasites to effectively and safely control the pest biologically, takes a long time. Industry is not interested in funding that. They want entomologists to work on type #1 poisons, not to spend 20 years in the lab studying one species to identify a key hormone.<p>Academic entomologists who want to pursue these studies aren&#x27;t pulling in the big grants, either. Evans tells of having to advise a graduate student to NOT specialize in parasitic wasps, despite the student&#x27;s interest in and talent at it, because he would not be able to get funding for research in that area.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Life-Little-Known-Planet-Biologists/dp/1558212493"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Life-Little-Known-Planet-Biologists/dp...</a>",1398899899

Okay, but integration tests are slow, so you&#x27;ll never test all the permutations of the interactions of the components.<p>Integration tests aren&#x27;t necessarily slow in any dramatic way (though they&#x27;ll naturally be slower than unit tests), but in any nontrivial system you still won&#x27;t test all the permutations of interactions between components because the number of such permutations will be prohibitively large even if integration tests were as fast as unit tests.<p>My preference is to aim for <i>path complete</i> integration tests, and thorough unit tests.<p>> When working with something as complex as an ORM like ActiveRecord, isolating the business logic and using the ORM strictly for persistence may allow for fast tests, but you still run the risk of bugs creeping in on the interface because of some assumption about or change in the way ActiveRecord works between versions or whatever.<p>If you isolate the domain and persistence layers rather than combining them the way Rails seems oriented toward, the persistence layer still ought to be a testable unit -- and as its <i>job</i> is persistence, you wouldn&#x27;t isolate the database from it to test it. OTOH, its a unit that should be more stable than the model layer in most cases, and you won&#x27;t pay the higher costs for running its unit tests when you are making changes to the model layer.<p>> That&#x27;s why, as ugly and slow as Rails unit tests are, they are a simplifying compromise that strikes a balance between the theoretical ideal of a unit test and an integration test.<p>Why compromise between unit tests and integration tests when the two aren&#x27;t exclusive and serve different purposes? Why not actually have good unit tests <i>and</i> good integration tests, instead of beasts that are neither fish nor fowl and are less than optimal as either?<p>It seems that the argument here is based on the false dichotomy that suggests <i>if</i> I do unit testing, I <i>can&#x27;t</i> have integration tests, so I either need to <i>just</i> do integration tests or, for some reason, trade both for some sort-of-unit-ish tests that test the persistence and domain layers as if they were the same unit.",1398899692

On the other hand it makes me throw my hands up when I see some of the examples provided. 100 lines of code to test 50 lines of code, which implement a catalog is pretty par for the course it seems in TDD advocacy.  This could honestly be me venting my current frustrations, but I get tired of this type of advocacy, also often seen in the functional world, of proving how great something is by using the most trivial possible example, in a domain squarely in your technique&#x27;s wheelhouse.  100 lines of code runs in 0.24s? What is this, I don&#x27;t even. Your functional algorithm is incredibly elegant at implementing the fibonacci sequence? Awesome.<p>But are these things honestly the bulk of what people do? Is testing that you can put objects in a catalog, access them, and remove them most of what people do and need assurances on?  Am I the only person who has spent most of their career working on software with codebases measured in the millions of lines, with significant user interfaces as well as significant technical domain knowledge embedded in them? I know that TDD says if our objects have many collaborators we are &quot;doing it wrong&quot; but honestly how far do you break down something without it blowing up into a million classes and a ton of code? How do you get around the fact that a button press can set off a numerical simulation (actually these are super testable and I support that), several trips to the database, multiple changes to the user interface, all in the face of dozens of constraints at all levels of the program to ultimately end up with the graphical representation of chemical pressure that the user wants? Especially when every moving piece in that calculation is supposed to be tested apparently in independent units?<p>I would estimate that the bulk of code that I have experienced in my career relied on multiple other objects to be effective. Do I just mock these out and pay the price of keeping those mocks in sync with the classes they are imitating? Do I then have my test be tightly coupled to the internals of the function being tested, making sure this mock is called in this way, this many times? Do I rewrite things such that every function takes its collaborators as arguments and returns the results I am looking for? What happens when each of those collaborators is itself a giant series of other stateful objects or at least provides access to a highly complex piece of state which is a pain in the ass to setup?<p>I ask these questions seriously, because on the one hand TDD advocates keep telling me I am not professional if I don&#x27;t follow their practices, but on the other the details of how to do so in the face of real-world constraints (not 50 line data-containers) are always somehow left out of the discussion.

There are a lot of developers out there that will take what DHH says for &quot;the golden rule&quot; without critically thinking about the content of his assertions. (Of course this is true for a lot of vocal developers, including Gary). When we have folks like Uncle Bob and Gary Bernhardt challenging those assertions, all of us can benefit. And for those people who are not used to, or don&#x27;t have the experience in the community of speaking up and challenging ideas, they can learn that it&#x27;s not OK just to take someone&#x27;s opinion on software development as the truth.

This thread includes a link to the full report,[1] and the report is a document with a good table of contents and is a searchable .PDF document besides. So you and everyone here can check my work when I say that your statement<p><i>In America, the number one thing you can do is stop eating factory farmed meat. That is a huge contributor to antibiotics resistance.</i><p>goes beyond the available evidence. But props to you for saying &quot;In America,&quot; in that statement, because it is plain that in some other parts of the world, where the problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is most severe, the main cause of the problem is misuse of antibiotics in human medicine rather than meat production. (India especially is an example of that kind of problem.) More details of course can be found in the report. Methinks the statement is based just a bit too much on propaganda by vegan activists.

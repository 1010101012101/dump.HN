That doesn&#x27;t sound typical or correct. I have only seen releases for the results of the test which yes, if come back positive and you have proof of legal use will indicate you&#x27;ve been getting treatment based on someone&#x27;s guess. However, it should stop there. If someone from HR starts asking medical questions about why you are getting treatment, that sounds like it&#x27;s crossing a serious line and I&#x27;d be looking into whether that&#x27;s legal or not. That sounds like a company that is hiring some shitty people, never mind whether they are good or not because they have a drug testing policy.<p>>Why bother with this nonsense when there are so many better employment options?<p>You want to work in a specific industry",1439643526

It is totally just a way of isolating and modularizing complexity. If you want reuse, look elsewhere, like in libraries or components. Designing nice abstractions is hard in any paradigm: the last time I was in a room with the Haskell folks (like SPJ), they spent a lot of time talking about building elegant abstractions for solving problem X in Haskell, where coming up with those abstractions didn&#x27;t seem easy at all.<p>I don&#x27;t think one can really teach reusable abstraction design like one can teach algorithms.

10065247,comment,10062134,10065013,0,0,Osmium,,,"> [Touch ID] enables someone to build a large database of fingerprint hashes. (Don&#x27;t give me any of that &quot;it doesn&#x27;t upload the actual fingerprints&quot; - uploading hashes is just as useful to security services)<p>This is speaking from a position of ignorance. Apple has been leading the way with responsible fingerprint management, in contrast to nearly every other fingerprint-capable device manufacturer out there (e.g. see HTC&#x27;s recent debacle). Presupposing good faith on their part, the stated <i>design</i> of Touch ID is to prevent <i>even the fingerprint hash</i> from being accessible to the OS itself, let alone leave the device. All the fingerprint logic and stored hashes runs on a logically distinct &quot;secure enclave&quot; and <i>it</i> checks your fingerprints and just returns &quot;match&quot; or &quot;no match&quot; back to the OS (as I understand it).<p>Technical details here <a href=""https://www.quora.com/What-is-Apple’s-new-Secure-Enclave-and-why-is-it-important?share=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quora.com/What-is-Apple’s-new-Secure-Enclave-and...</a> but there&#x27;s a white paper out there somewhere too.<p>If anything, this kind of set-up is what gives me some faith that Apple might do self-driving cars correctly, rather than other manufacturers who think it&#x27;s somehow okay that the entertainment system runs on the same device that can change driving parameters. Apple clearly needs to up their game too, but it&#x27;s clear that the possibility of hacking cars is a Bad Thing, and as cars get more networked and more smart it seems clear that some car manufacturers do not seem to have the in-house expertise capable of doing it responsibly, so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if a tech company actually ends up doing a better job (whether that&#x27;s Apple or Google or whoever).",1439643196

The advantage here is that you can then page through the line history on another terminal or even another computer. The downside is that that your terminal (xterm/iterm/whatever) has to decide what to show when you page up. It has no way to read screen&#x27;s internal scrollback, so it can either show you old non-screen lines, or hide the scrollback entirely. Switching into/out of screen will just add to the confusion.<p>(I think some terminals will hide the scrollback history when they spot the TTY in curses-style mode, and only bring it back when that process quits?)<p>One other annoyance for me is the behaviour of scrollback with a command like &#x27;less&#x27; or &#x27;more&#x27;.

Let&#x27;s see Apple&#x27;s big, giant successes, and let&#x27;s see how it benefitted them.<p>1. PC - Initially made for one particular store out of garage. It benefitted them to focus on just that store, because it gave them a feel of exclusive store without having one. Customers would come in, and buy there, because there was no price comparison possible with other stores. With price comparison came product comparison, and all PC companies as small as Apple lost business because of that. This was also accidentally done as Apple got a sizeable order from one single store, and they didn&#x27;t have proper bandwidth to deliver even that.<p>2. Music - Initial iPod was Mac only. Steve mentions over and over in documentaries and books that it was the only reason he could convince music companies to let him sell music for $0.99 on iTunes. Too small a product, they thought, for tiny Mac-only player, it would be a good publicity thing. Had iTunes was a global platform from day one, it would be selling you full albums, with a complimentary CD delivered to door. Shipping and handling additional.<p>3.iPhone - AT&T only. And on this one people cried.

Most likely if they failed to even deal with this, the situation is pretty bad in many other ways.<p>USDS has done some nice things, according to stories I have read, but it seems it is just this appendage to the bureaucracy that is given some leeway due to powerful allies in the bureaucracy.  This has always been the case in government and lots of good IT stuff has been done by those given power to avoid the normal IT processes by powerful allies.<p>But the other success isn&#x27;t about an improved system it is about typical power politics in a bureaucracy.  Things like sticking to bad policy that is driven by command and control thinking treating workers like drones such as polygraphs or drug testing for office workers is a sign that even the core thinking around the management system is extremely poor.  In that case the management system will constantly be imposing idiotic rules on you that can be ignore only due to a powerful ally preventing enforcement (or just the incompetence of the bureaucracy to enforce the rules it set in place).",1439641447

Though the modeling of visceral/organ fat is\nspecifically excluded for further research, the fat modeling methods\npresented are both effective and useful for model generation.

Anyone can be a totally\nuninformed and acrimonious critic, and unfortunately, most human beings\nare complete suckers for controversy, so the &quot;mean and/or dumb but\nmassively up-voted&quot; comment problem tends to be self-reinforcing. The\nonly good news is, both the bad commenters and the bad up-voters are\nquietly handled in code [2].<p>When you see the &quot;mean and/or dumb&quot; comments, or even the excessively\nnegative comments, you should down-vote them since they are against the\nsite guidelines [3, 4]. When a comment is particularly egregious, click\nthe &quot;X hours ago&quot; link on the comment, and then the &#x27;flag&#x27; link (if it&#x27;s\navailable). Like the down-vote privilege, the flag privilege also has a\nkarma threshold to prevent abuse.<p>When you realize how the excessively negative comments are really just\ntrying to seek attention, you understand they are just another form of\ntrolling. In this case, &#x27;sigmar&#x27; is doing simple drive-by-trolling; say\nsomething as offensive as possible to get attention, and refuse to back\nit up with references when questioned about it. Yep, you got trolled.\nBut I hope you&#x27;ll try to look for this sort of negative nonsense in the\nfuture, and down-vote/flag it appropriately.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403696"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403696</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9317916"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9317916</a>",1439640894

I&#x27;d guess if they did, NTRU or a derivative would be one they&#x27;d consider first: Security Innovation were trying to sell them that at about the same time Certicom were pushing elliptic curves. (I&#x27;m not as convinced about ideal lattices, but that&#x27;s an artifact of my not being as familiar with the field.)<p>Pre-shared keys, as they suggest there, have no forward secrecy - which makes them great for those who really like stealing, say, IPsec keys… like the NSA. It may work with the kind of old military key infrastructure they and GCHQ have, that regularly distributes random keys from centralised, organisationally-trusted sources on specialised hardware; it is a terrible recommendation for civilians.<p>Interesting that they&#x27;re still married to P-384 (probably the most annoying curve to implement correctly). Properly-implemented Ed448-Goldilocks is safer, and that&#x27;s what CFRG are going with for the &quot;paranoid&quot; level.",1439640237

VC funding is just one way to go and we really need all options visible to entrepreneurs so that they choose the best option for them.<p>I think the aim should always be to support people building real businesses, not just those building unicorns. It is a real accomplishment (and one that should be celebrated) to build a business that makes a useful product that customer love even if it is only for a smallish market. Lets avoid using terms that disparage this effort.",1439640165

My requirements are simple: I want something height-adjustable and sturdy, but without electronics or a motor. Simplicity is key. I&#x27;m thinking something with a crank to adjust the height of the surface.<p>I know there have been a lot of threads on HN about standing desks (I&#x27;ve read them all). Some members might be tired of the subject but I wanted to ask what other HN people, especially developers, are using. Thanks.",1439640096

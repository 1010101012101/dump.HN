546738,comment,546549,546688,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Is it really responsible for a bank to back 30-year loans with demand deposits, at 25-to-1 leverage? I really can't imagine that happening without government intervention, and if it only happens when the government makes it happen, there's a good reason to expect that it's irrational.<p>Banks are hybrid companies in the sense that FDIC insurance means they are basically conduits for lending to the government. If I deposit $100 with my local bank, I don't care whether the banker keeps it in cash, invests it in penny stocks, or spends it on whores -- no matter what, the government backs my deposit.<p>This is for other promises from companies. E.g. if I pay someone $100 now for $100 worth of lawn care over the next five years, I make damn sure I can trust that person. If I pay the bank $100 for a CD maturing in five years, I don't.<p>This gives all banks an incentive to take undue risk, balanced by government regulation, which gives them a secondary incentive to find clever ways to take big risks (which they do by hiring clever people who would otherwise do more socially useful stuff).",1238884358

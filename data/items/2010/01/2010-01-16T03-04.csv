The design of ISS is, to use programmer jargon, tightly coupled to its role in Earth orbit, sending it on a mission to Mars without significant modifications would cause its crew to suffer severe radiation exposure. Not to mention that we'd lose radio contact, the crew would run out of supplies and die, and the station would probably miss its target and fail to enter orbit around Mars (assuming it had the capability to do so, which it doesn't). Adding all those modifications would be more expensive than building a new vehicle that was actually designed for the journey.<p>Moreover, the most difficult aspect of all of this is propulsion. ISS is vastly heavier than other craft we would send to Mars, making it a more difficult task to move to Mars than any of the reference Mars missions on the table.",1263613447

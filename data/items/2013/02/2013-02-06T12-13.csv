I like to have stimulating discussions with smart, like-minded people who offer new perspectives. And while I'm at it, I like startups, too. While I have no personal connection to YC, I like hearing from their companies first hand because they are interesting. I think it's great that people doing startups (YC or not) sometimes post their demo online here on HN. I also love to hear from hackers who did nifty one-offs on the weekend. And open source projects. And in-depth discussions about programming. And hacker culture. The whole thing.<p>I am also clearly not one of the Old Crew. You have been a fan of the band since before they became cool and I have not. I get it. But for all that talk about evaporative cooling, let's not forget that every community <i>needs</i> fresh blood to survive. More often than not, I feel I'm in the right place here. Even if that perception turns out to be false, there are countless other new users who definitely <i>are</i> enriching this community immensely.<p>Could HN be improved? Absolutely. But every time someone like you suggests that this is a nearly meaningless and diluted forum where inane wannabes try to sell stuff to each other, I feel like you're attacking me and, more importantly, other users who provide exponentially more value than I do.<p>If you want to ""add value"" to HN, excellent, please work on doing that. A first step would likely involve stopping to make it and its users look bad. What you are doing is simply sabotage from the inside and it's exacerbated by the fact that you are one of the most influential users around here. By making it appear desolate, you participate actively in dragging it down. We can agree on the need for continued improvement without suggesting that everyone but the Old Crew are idiots.<p>There is something else in your comment that just rubs me the wrong way. It reminds me of that time-honored trick where someone first totally demolishes the worth of a person or company, only to portray themselves as seeing the hidden ""potential"" seconds later and then magnanimously suggest how they're going to rescue said person/company. I apologize if this is unjustified, but it is the impression I got from your post.<p>By the way, I believe one of the easiest ways to improve something <i>right now</i> is by committing yourself to vote down snappy low quality one-liner comments that add nothing to the discussion.",1360155241

5176074,comment,5175162,5176038,2,0,jacques_chester,,,"The hint was in my callout to multi-objective optimisation problems.<p>MOOPs generally don't have an optimal solution. There's a pareto front of good solutions, but you have to decide what you value.<p>In physiological terms, you can't have it all. You need to make tradeoffs. The adaptations for strength are competitive with adaptations for endurance, and so on. You can't be very strong and easily run a marathon.<p>Now, suppose we decide to develop an index of fitness. Any such index could only be tested according to specific <i>tasks</i>, which introduces the problem of task selection. Because you can quickly optimise those physiological tradeoffs to maximise index performance. If for example your fitness index has lots of running and swimming, endurance athletes will dominate. If there's lots of lifting and pushing, strength athletes will dominate. Average it over all possible tasks and I suspect the No Free Lunch Theorem will apply and everyone will suck equally.<p>There is no ""fair"" index because the entire concept of ""general fitness"" is nonsensical. All fitness is fitness for a task or group of tasks.<p>This is true of almost everything in life, because almost all the hairy problems we face are about trading off multiple objectives. The important lesson is learning that sometimes, you simply cannot have everything you want.",1360155135

Whether they're viable or not depends on location, e.g. solar isn't really too great in Denmark, we're too far north. Storage is a problem, but not quite as big as you would think, and a multitude of solutions do exist.<p>Denmark has a plan of getting rid of fossils over the next decades, and we're well on our way. It's not a research plan, it's an investment/building plan.<p>Furthermore, while some subsidies are currently needed to cover risks and capital expenditures, the studies I've seen predict that we're probably going to end up with an infrastructure that's not more expensive, it may even be cheaper. Like energy from an old nuclear power plant is really cheap today because the capital expenditures have been covered many years ago (discounting insurance and other thorny nuclear issues).",1360154909

5175997,comment,5173398,5173798,1,0,vidarh,,,"> When I'm really refreshed and interested and doing well and eating right I can pull all nighters and maintain work quality. I can't maintain this for extended stretches at all though.<p>I pull all-nighters regularly to work on personal projects, and managed to push out 4-6 hours of concentration during them after a full day work, but the key to that for me (with the caveat that I'm close to 38, and probably could push through more when I was in school, but on the other hand I know how to pace myself far better):<p>- I nap 1-2hour in the evening, after dinner, and then take a 1-2 hour relaxation period where I'll vegetate totally in front of the TV or listening to music punctuated by low-concentration tasks such as making a list of what I hope to achieve (with estimates and times at the night where I hope to get to them, which makes for a hilarious lesson in how bad we are at reliably estimating stuff...)<p>- I pump myself full of caffeine (usually about 200mg, my caffeine sensitivity is really low) and b-vitamins, and ""dripfeed"" myself sugar.<p>- I'll use modafinil to retain alertness when I go off for work the next day.<p>- I'll go to the gym but focus on cardio, stretches and time in the steam room and make sure I have time to take ""the slow train"" which gives me a 30 minute nap during my commute.<p>- I'll make sure to take a proper relaxing lunch break. Sometimes I'll go find a park bench and sit and nap or meditate for half an hour.<p>- I'll make sure to schedule my daytime work to the times that works best for me, and try hard to get some extra high concentration work out of the way on the ""before"" days, and do more ""menial"" tasks on the ""after"" days to ensure the overall effect on my daytime job is minimal (overall I think I actually end up with a net benefit, as the personal projects I work on generally are learning experiences that are often synergistic to what I do during the day).<p>- I crash totally the next evening - usually going to bed at 8pm and sleeping until 6am the following day. Everything in my scheduling is geared towards keeping me productive the following day too, but with the expectation that the evening will be totally lost.<p>- If I at any time see my productivity start slipping at night, I go to bed. If I see my productivity start slipping in my day job, I take a week or two break from this schedule and get to bed extra early, because I know if I don't I'll tend to get into a rut where things take longer and tire me out more, prompting me to get stupid ideas about working even longer. And I never, ever do more than one or two of these a week...<p>In the end, I'm not gaining any hours per se, but the hours I get are hours where I'm more productive (the alternative for me was taking e.g. 8pm to 11pm on evenings where I'd still be tired and generally wouldn't concentrate well at all). The structure of a nap, slowly easing into it, and then focusing totally while the house is entirely quiet works very well for me. Probably isn't healthy in the long term, though. But I <i>need</i> me time desperately to stay sane (got a 3 year old that otherwise occupies all my time at home when he is awake).<p>It's a massive hassle just to get that extra block of concentrated time (now, if I could afford to slack off the entire following day at work, it'd be a lot easier :) ), but it feels worth it at the moment. When my son gets older and demands less of my time so I get more time to myself earlier in the evening, I very much doubt I'll keep this up (though I've grown attached to taking 1-3 hour naps in the evening and working a bit into the nap instead, so that I'll probably keep up to some extent)",1360153417

More likely, your idea of ""sustained 12-16 hour days"" only actually involves a few hours of what the rest of us would consider mentally strenuous work a day.<p>Put in 12-16 hour days for a while with repetitive, simple tasks taking most  of the time when working on something that is overall exciting, sure, that works for a while (though eventually that too tends to produce burnout - I've had to order developers home after the strain starter producing negative results with fewer hours than that).<p>For me, what works best is that whenever I feel that my concentration is slipping, if I don't feel I have time for a proper break, I will switch to mindless tasks, such as updating my todo list (often spending time breaking bigger tasks into tasks that <i>are</i> realistically small enough for windows of a couple of hours), doing my e-mail, or if I'm home I'll do the housework, and I'll try to ""switch off"" while I do, practicing mindfulness meditation for the truly ""mindless"" tasks such as cleaning.<p>Sometimes I get lucky, and my concentration stays on top for longer in one go, and I cherish those moments, but I ""pay"" afterwards (e.g. crash on the sofa when I get home, or need to slow down the following day).",1360152484

It is trying to tease out the 'rules' upon which the human brain is built. It has been shown by Henry Markram and his crew that there are in fact rules, which can be simulation, and can explain a great deal of things that would take literally thousands and thousands of experiments - see his connectome paper for an example of how they can predict the connectivity between neurons with a high accuracy - <a href=""http://www.frontiersin.org/blog/The_Emergent_Connectome/66"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.frontiersin.org/blog/The_Emergent_Connectome/66</a>. The Human Brain Project is composed of a great deal of leading scientists from around the world and their institutions. Do you really think these people (some of which are nobel laureates) are less clued up than the author of ""on intelligence"". The most pertinent thing to get across here is that the HBP is not an AI project. It is a recreation of the human brain through biophysically accurate models.",1360152442

They were frustrated that most work in psychology studied childhood development in depth, but little research was done into development during your 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s. The research is focused entirely on guys (sorry ladies).  Not surprisingly, he was able to find several phases most men go through.  Several friends have found the book really helpful when they're reflecting on life.<p>The Up Series (<a href=""http://refer.ly/a4hN"" rel=""nofollow"">http://refer.ly/a4hN</a>) is a set of films, each shot every 7 years that chronicles the real lives of a dozen people from England.  While it has a bit of reality TV ""drama"", most all of it is the real unvarnished changes that people go through as they age, including their regrets and accomplishments.  It's a remarkable watch, given that you get to see people age from 7 to 56.  Just as an example, I feel it prepared me ahead of time to deal with the death of my mother, and savor the time that I have with my dad who's still alive.  Ultimately, we all have to face up to a lot of the same things, and it's comforting to have a bit of a map.",1360152224

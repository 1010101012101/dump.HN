The remaining hurdles exist beyond, in attainable projects that lets you poke and prod at the internals and get a good feel for how and why something works, or how to break it. Hopefully our little starter project are simple enough to get kids (or anyone for that matter) out there and -trying something-, no matter how silly or simple.

2184289,comment,2183842,2184222,0,0,roryokane,,,"I would think they didn’t explain how it makes JS better because they were on the defensive from people who said leaving semicolons out will break code. They are saying “stop forbidding me from coding in the style I want, my style works just fine”. They are just trying to defend their style, not convert people to it.<p>However, that’s not to say there is no reason to omit semicolons. I personally leave out semicolons as an extension of the DRY principle – if you are putting a line break after a statement anyway, then you might as well leave off the semicolon. It’s one less character to delete if you combine two adjacent lines into one. Also, if you already think of line breaks and statement ends going together, then semicolons are just noise that you have to make an effort to ignore – the effort required may be small, but there’s little reason not to avoid that effort.<p>The only problem with omitting semicolons in JavaScript is this case mentioned in “Semicolons in JavaScript are optional”:<p><pre><code>  a = b + c\n  (d + e).print()\n</code></pre>\nThe author recommends avoiding the error in that by changing the last line to<p><pre><code>  ;(d + e).print()\n</code></pre>\n. If the extra effort of adding a semicolon before all line-starting parentheses costs more effort than you would save by getting the two advantages I described above, then maybe adding semicolons everywhere is right for you. You might have to experiment with coding in both styles to be able to accurately quantify how much those two advantages and one disadvantage would affect you.",1296945661

Is that article wrong? Did minifying semicolons use to work, but they removed that feature for some reason? Does no one actually use Closure Compiler, and the other minifiers don’t support missing semicolons? Or is the reason the plugin you found “blows up” simply the error described in “Semicolons in JavaScript are optional” in the section “The only real pitfall when coding without semicolons”, which is starting a line with “(d + e)” instead of “;(d + e)”?<p>That article says that if a minifier doesn’t understand JavaScript that an actual JavaScript interpreter can understand, the minifier is buggy. I agree with it – if your minifier messed up the semicolon-less jQuery plugin, and if none of the situations I mentioned above was the case, then your minifier needs fixing, or you should start using a different one.",1296944660

2184249,comment,2182863,2182863,0,0,boskone,,,"I was posting about a similiar system around a year ago.<p>Ended up standardizing clusters of only 3 nodes.  Initially I wrote a Paxos+Dynamo but it was a dead end for me for our needs.  I did not need a massive data store, but a cheap highly available / scalable enterprise service that consistently gave the same answer. e.g. an eCommerce pricing engine.  3 commodity box nodes is all you ever need.  I've done over 500,000 prices per second with ~ 9 unique way of pricing ~475,000 skus, based off the equivalent of 100's millions of data rows.<p>Use IP multicast for cluster/leader election configuration.  Much faster.  All a server needs configured to boot strap into the cluster is a single IP.  Opted to not use Zookeeper though it came out when I was writing my system.<p>I tried a Dynamo/Cassandra approach on the updates but abandoned it as too slow early on.  I ended up using something more like Linked-Ins Kafka for the ""log"" shuttling.  In Kafka parlance, one topic with 3 partitions one for each node. Each node mirrors all three partitions but is owner of 1.  One other diff is I do push/push while Kafka a does push/pull.  This makes sense as each node is both a broker for and consumer of the other nodes.<p>Node 0 writes incoming updates to partition 0 and does a 1 out of 2 push to partition 0 on nodes 1 and 2 (third auto drops to async as we have 2 of 3 durable stores)<p>For update application Paxos is used to then only for consensus of the highwater mark of message Id (the kafka offset).  Analogous to Spinnaker's LSN.<p>Consensus updates to the message high water mark are ""batch"" applied by a single thread, and only a single thread, to the in-memory store which uses a special array based hash map (Compact Hashmap).  The single thread with a ReaderWriter lock give transactions for free with a ""database lock"" being faster row locking as its all in mem.  I have the equivalent of 100s millions of rows in mem all synched between the three nodes.<p>One final optimization is the observation that if the overlaying application is REST based then updates commute under PUT semantics (version with a vector clock).  For this type of application the total ordering of the application of the updates across the nodes is relaxed as it is guaranteed to converge (eventually consistent).<p>Since all update are batch applied, in mem, on a single threads with a reader/writer lock a client always views only the converged consistent state though each nodes path to convergence may be different.<p>I had looked at using a Dynamo/Cassandra like Spinnaker but after coding it found it too slow.  When I went with a log shuttling push/push similar to LinkedIns Kafka performance of updates jumped quite nicely.  I note one of the authors works at LinkedIn.<p>Wrote the thing in Scala which was also sort of new at the time.  But turned out to be a good choice.",1296944418

To make that claim, someone needs to run a controlled test like the one you describe here.<p>Strictly speaking, I think you're right, but it was interesting that it would accept mappings that didn't exist elsewhere, rather than requiring the same mapping from at least one other source.  But you're right that a more complete test is warranted.  And Bing may have already adjusted things to prevent this, so we may never know.<p>> Although I don't really know what half the fields do, so there could be something clever going on in there.<p>True, but the mysterious parts I see appear to be constants (I may have overlooked something, though, so feel free to point out any mysterious dynamic bits I'm ignoring).

Every function can be constructed from a hierarchy of programmable, fixed-size LUTs which are statically connected (for example, you can build a 5-input LUT from three 4-input LUTs). Now you don&#x27;t need to build routing, it&#x27;s implicit in the next-state and output functions.<p>[1] like this: <a href=""http://electrosofts.com/verilog/mealy.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://electrosofts.com/verilog/mealy.gif</a>",1444805831

10385293,comment,10380251,10384156,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Yes, almost certainly a scam, for a few reasons. The first being that hand-held Raman spectroscopy devices are currently the realm of <i>extremely</i> pricey systems that are targeted at industry primarily (we&#x27;re talking $10k at the very, very low end). Building a hand-held device that could do even a tiny fraction of what those units are capable of would be hugely disruptive for that market. So why not approach that market at all? Probably because it&#x27;s vastly more savvy than consumers. Additionally, there is absolutely zero hard info anywhere about their device, it&#x27;s design, it&#x27;s specs, anything like that. Not only isn&#x27;t there a specrum, there isn&#x27;t even a &quot;this is what a spectrum from our final equipment might look like&quot; representation. It&#x27;s all smoke and mirrors.<p>The biggest giveaway in that particular campaign though is something that most ordinary people won&#x27;t pick up on: gluten. You tell someone that a spectrometer can detect sugar, they&#x27;ll nod, you tell someone that it can detect gluten and they&#x27;ll still nod, but people who know better will have their ears perk up. Because gluten is just a protein, and proteins are a nightmare when it comes to spectroscopy. Spectroscopy picks up the different bonds that are in a molecule. A simple molecule with only a few, very different bonds is easy to distinguish. But proteins are polymers made up of tens of thousands to millions of amino-acids, which blur together in spectroscopy. To distinguish different proteins from one another with <i>any</i> kind of spectroscopy (whether Raman, IR, or even NMR) requires high end equipment which can give you very high resolution spectra. A low cost, consumer grade spectrometer is going to have very low resolution and be even more difficult to do. If they could pull it off it would be a tremendous breakthrough. The idea that they&#x27;ve made such a huge leap without seeking traditional investors to go after the industrial market, without any substantive research backing is, frankly, not robust against the much more realistic probability that they are pulling some sort of scam that involves a device that maybe has some capability or other but is nothing like what they say it is.",1444804394

I rarely found it worth my while engaging in a job with a new client if it billed under 10-15 days. $3500 is only a few days work, so they&#x27;ll have to ensure the administrative overhead in bidding and billing is minimised.<p>> Whoever has the lowest bid at the closing time will have 10 working days to ship the code necessary to satisfy the criteria. If the criteria are met, the vendor gets paid. It&#x27;s that easy. If the criteria aren&#x27;t met, the next lowest bidder gets 10 working days to ship the code. In order to make this work, we will provide acceptance criteria, instead of requirements. This limits the possibility of misinterpretation and ensures the quality of delivery.<p>I fear that the focus on tight acceptance criteria will encourage gaming the system. There&#x27;s no incentive for the contractor to do more than the bare minimum. Even if you gain a reputation with the procuring team of being reliable they still have to go with the lowest bidder for the next job.<p>For contractors, the optimum strategy would seem to be bid without spending any time coming up with an implementation strategy, then drop any jobs you win that don&#x27;t seem worthwhile after a few hours working out how to implement it.<p>Ultimately this becomes a test of how well the jobs can be specified. For this to be efficient they have to include the time spent internally preparing and assessing the result vs working over a longer periods with people with whom they can build a trusting working relationship.",1444803263

Specifically, I think they will have problems with under-bidding and then abandonment. If lowest-bidder is based on some government requirement though, it&#x27;s funny to see such a forward-looking system continuing to be constrained by the same broken rule-set.<p>The prototypical bug bounty in an open source project is to assign an award based on the perceived value of the code, and then open it up to submissions, while providing a central place for anyone to post about their working on a solution, their progress, etc. People are encouraged to communicate openly about their progress, and any new entrants can decide based on that chatter if they should work on it, or assume someone else will claim the bounty.<p>The only job for the person awarding the bounty is clear acceptance criteria, and  public feedback on submissions. Then there are potentially issues with split bounties if multiple people end up contributing to the final result. Again, awards are at the determination of the offerer, but generally I think it&#x27;s best if they don&#x27;t directly control/assign the work.",1444802543

As a single seller or buyer, I can chose to move to eBayCompetitor but it does me no good - if there are no sellers or buyers at eBayCompetitor except me, the site is useless.<p>On the other hand, if everybody is at Google and someone starts GoogleCompetitor, I can leave Google and GoogleCompetitor would work just fine for me, because it doesn't matter whether anybody else uses GoogleCompetitor. You could end up with some kinds of semi-steady state like in the browser wars.<p>The problem in practice with search engines is that I am starting to get the idea that the ""market"" <i>likes</i> having a single search engine to worry about/buy ads to/manipulate ranks for. So it is possible than in reality there is some pressure against GoogleCompetitor gaining traction.",1242777517

617844,comment,617347,617347,0,0,Kadin,,,"Seems like it's applicable to parts of the WWW, but not all of it certainly.  Most pages are updated far less frequently.<p>I can only assume/hope that Google tries to take into account how frequently a page is modified in scheduling future crawls.  I.e. if they crawl daily for a week and there's only one update, only crawl it every 3 days in the future.  (You could probably have a much more aggressive backoff than this.)<p>It would probably make sense for Google and Twitter to do something on a level lower than HTML if searching Twitter feeds is really that big a deal (and I'm not sure it is). It doesn't make sense to pull down and index an entire user page on Twitter just to see if the most recent post has changed; using the API would be more efficient.  There are probably only a few web services this would be worth implementing for.",1242777304

My direct experience is quite different:<p>Company U: late 90's/early 2K's startup.  Free food was selected primarily on the basis of the cheapest stuff we could get for $1000/mo at the local discount club.  If $50 steaks would have made developers work 24/7 they would have still been outside of the budget.<p>Company H: Selection primarily based on what employees asked the Kitchen managers to stock.  If you wanted free-range organic tofu breakfast bars, you got them (provided the price was at least semi-reasonable).<p>Company S: (My wife is the director of finance here, I know enough about the selection criteria although I've never been a direct employee) Primarily cost/budget driven as well.<p>None of my experiences have ever involved people who consciously plot after-hours retention ratios of various foods.  It has pretty much always been a recognition along the lines of ""if people want to stay at work, it's cheaper to feed them than pay them to make them feel valued"".

437922,comment,437315,437847,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"OK but look at this jobs trend line from indeed:\n<a href=""http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=PHP&l="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=PHP&l=</a><p>All those companies just got stuck and see no way out? I'm no devotee of PHP at all, but just getting stuck isn't something that works for long periods of time for so many new projects. These are websites, not core banking systems or OS kernels.<p>I think the real reason for PHP's success is that PHP doesn't force people to become software engineers when all they want to do is print some database records on a web page. And it doesn't force employers to hire expensive software engineers just to thrust software engineering complexity down their throat when they really don't need any of it.<p>Believe it or not, there is still a great number of websites that are not web apps and never become web apps. They just show you some pages of content with some dynamic parts on some of them.<p>There's no reason for MVC, no reason for object orientation, no reason for separation between designers and developers, no reason for ORM, no worries about transactions, no interaction with messaging systems or other integration stuff, no need for unit testing or mock objects, no need for 101 deployment scenarios, no need for REST APIs, no need for maintainability because there simply isn't that much code to maintain. But that's what 90% of RoR, Django, JEE documentation is about.<p>People complain about atrocious PHP code. That's because some websites ""degenerate"" into web apps over time. The majority of people who create them are not software engineers and have no interest in becoming software engineers.<p>And yes some of those ""degenerate"" websites are getting stuck with PHP. But I think you would be mistaken to assume that all or even most of them go down this route. Most websites just remain websites. Some do a rewrite. Others add more interaction or features by installing one of those clunky CMSs. And the CMSs are written in PHP to let the creators of websites (not web apps) customise the system using little pieces of PHP, again without any need for software engineering practices.<p>So if you need a taxi today, why would you hire an international logistics specialist? Is it because you might get stuck with Beijing taxi drivers shipping iron ore to your steel factory, or because you may never need iron ore deliveries? I think for most users of PHP it's the second. They never do complex web apps.<p>And all of that has nothing to do with whether or not PHP is suitable for creating complex web apps using software engineering principles.",1232182006

K.A. Ericsson is a psychologist who studies expert performance, and he's clearly shown that a high iq is not required to become an expert in something. What is required is 1000's of hours of deliberate practice. So basically when you see overnight successes, you're really missing the hard work that got them there. Everyone needs to put in the effort.<p>And besides research is coming out that really supports the idea that intelligence can be raised. There is some evidence that practicing the Dual-n-back test will raise your fluid iq. And the test isn't domain specific.\n<a href=""http://cognitivefun.net/test/5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cognitivefun.net/test/5</a> is a good site for the test.The community there is also really good.",1232181612

437911,comment,423839,426622,0,0,iofthestorm,,,"> Does ""Programs and Features"" do anything more/less than ""Add/Remove Programs"" in Vista SP3? No.<p>Actually, yes. You can search the list of programs, and there are a lot more columns that you can sort them by, which is <i>hugely</i> useful when you're trying to find something.<p>> With regards to search, I've found their implementation inferior not only to OS X's spotlight, but also Google Desktop Search. Especially pre-SP1 Vista search. But assuming you don't have Google Desktop Search installed (like the average user) it is still a usability win. But again, not worth a $400 upgrade, considering Google Desktop Search is free and runs great on XP SP3.<p>Care to give any specifics? I've found it to be better than Google Desktop search and a recent annoying problem with an OS X Macbook convinced me that spotlight is useless. I was trying to browse the network, and I tried searching for network and it would not show the network browser in the spotlight (apparently it's hidden in one of the menus in Finder because Apple thinks its users are too stupid to use networks, or something). And really, $400? Are you really trying to say that Vista costs $400? Sure, that was the <i>retail</i> price of Vista Ultimate when it launched, but now even the most expensive edition is only $300, and upgrades or OEM versions are half as much. And most people upgrade their OS when they get a new computer, so that's a stupid argument.<p>>. Like most Real Power Users I've adapted to the big change (internet apps)<p>> So yeah, most of us have adjusted to change. By bypassing crap when there are better alternatives.<p>Huh... one thing doesn't follow the other. But keep thinking that if you want...",1232181544

It tends to go across the civil-liberties-leaning political spectrum. Before the left-leaning Reddit had a subreddit on cop abuses, the libertarian magazine Reason (reason.com) had them as a regular feature.

2814630,comment,2812324,2813918,4,0,jsavimbi,,,"What I've learned from larger companies:<p>1. Your manager there is concerned with building their fiefdom and without a loyal crew, they know they won't succeed internally. They'll have little time for your negotiations skills and will be very unimpressed if you bring up offers from unknown starts-ups. They're a manager at a Fortune 500 company, dontcha know? It's their life and chosen career, not to mention their lifeline. You're dead to them once you leave or hint of leaving for more money.<p>2. Salary levels and compensation packages are designed and set by professional HR crew whose job it is to keep labor costs down and weed out malcontents. Where do they get their salary guidelines? From industry groups and consultants who specialize in companies of that size and who share that same info with every one of their clients. Good luck walking around with an offer from a similar-sized competitor. They'll be on the phone to them, probably friends, telling them what a dunce you are and you'll find your offer rescinded. Never ever mention where you're going or what they'll be paying you. Much less at a big company.<p>3. No matter how big or small the organization, outside of the entertainment industry, and I include sports here, very few will be willing to tolerate a disruptive prima donna for very long. Especially rank and file developers with visions of grandeur brought on by big money stories and newly acquired skills.<p>Like I said, present your situation to management but don't wait around for them to bring salaries into line. Some times they simply can't, you've misread the market or your importance to them. If that's the case, don't force their hand.",1311807520

I've found that just releasing software serves several useful purposes:<p>1) It's a fun escape from the ""real task"" which is building decalcms.com which is a very hard, complex task that's taking a really long time and which I'm worried about monetising (and represents a huge investment of time and money)<p>2) It's a way of engaging with people and building an audience. Every time I do something like this, I pick up a couple of Twitter followers, or I get to engage with the people that sign up to discuss the product and of course I get the name Working Software in front of a bunch of people<p>3) It gives some little ideas validation (or not) so that when I feel like a little escape I have something that I can work on and know that there are at least a few people that will care. I'm also building an ORM for SQL lovers at <a href=""https://github.com/iaindooley/PluSQL/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/iaindooley/PluSQL/</a> - I just find that if I don't do something with tangible (or ""releasable"") results every week then I get very bogged down in the marketing, monetisation and completion of Decal - this helps me regain perspective on life.<p>4) It's conceivable that if I just so happen to execute one of these right, it'll turn into a real product, who knows.<p>5) It's good practice for releasing. Putting something out in public is really nerve wracking and I'm not that used to it (same with sending bulk emails).

In my own very large organisation I actually introduced a (bespoke) system to allow communication that cuts across hierarchical boundaries.<p>I've taken some serious knocks pushing my agenda and it's taking a long time for the culture to change. Only now are some (20%) of our large number of directors starting to ""blog"" openly to staff rather than sending messages up and down the hierarchy. I hope to get managers beneath them to start using our internal social tool too.<p>I know that policies fail. I'm well known as a rule-breaker within my organisation but I'm also known as a person who can ""get things done"". I don't just mean that in a technical sense, or in a works-very-hard sense, but in a will-ignore-your-rules-to-get-things-done sense. Inevitably this means that I tread on some toes.<p>However, policies do have their place in large organisations. Very few people actually care about achieving any kind of significant change in such an organisation - many are happy to work 9-to-5 and just do what they're told (and do as little as possible). Policies are designed for exactly these people.<p>In an ideal world every worker would actually give a damn about their work and innovate in their own little area of responsibility. But it turns out that the way things are structured doesn't encourage this sort of behaviour. It's very hard to pay someone more than a lazy person with the same job title if they have the same job title.<p>I acknowledge your point about how people in large organisations will often look to better themselves at the expense of the company rather than seek to better the company and then hope for commensurate reward. I could talk about that for some time, but it wasn't really in the scope of my reply above. I do understand that many people act in this way. I could talk all day about why individuals might pursue goals different from those they're actually paid for but I'll skip it for now.<p>Coming back around to your point (per paragraph 3), I'd have to say that I do understand (as much as an individual can) the nature of large companies. My ""company"" is the fourth largest employer in the world and figures for how many people work for us tend to vary. However, it's somewhere between 1 and 2 million people. We have a very developed notion of ""corporate culture"" where I work :-)<p>My original point was that all companies do have a culture, as do all groups of people. Past a certain size it is always beneficial (to the shareholders) to ensure that the individuals within your company do not act as individuals so much but instead act in a way aligned to your corporate goals.<p>I did glance at the document you linked to but I don't really see the point of reading it all just to reply to your comment :-)",1311806026

A nice bit of press, good placement in the App Store, and revenues like no other project had yet produced.<p>There was just one problem: sometimes, you could enter a shitload of data into the app  and then it would crash without saving. A lot of work lost. Not all of the time, just enough to make you suspicious of the app. And as a result, a <i>worthless tool</i>.<p>The fix was very easy. Absurdly easy: one line of code. An over-released object. But Apple doesn't work quickly now and definitely didn't then. I had a choice: two weeks of selling what I knew to be a worthless app or destroy all my momentum and pull the app until the fix was ready.<p>So I pulled the app. Lost the high ranking that would have led to even more sales. Donated all the sales from that first day to a worthy cause, since I couldn't issue refunds. Fuck, did I need that money.<p>But I never looked back. Because it was the right thing to do.<p>You profit <i>from creating value</i>. If you do harm, you take responsibility and put things right. Anything less is unworthy of your humanity.<p>That's it. If my passion for doing the right thing makes me bad at certain things, oh well. Money comes and goes.

It smells very real. And there are still a ton of posts to the feedback/help forums asking / warning / telling of scams attempted or perpetrated.

Meeting the guest another. Some sort of in-apartment surveillance, at least of entry an exit areas, a third. At the very least this would help track the perp / establish whodunnit.<p>AirBnB could self-insure or take a guest deposit of some sort (possibly encouraging credit-card fraud) against such issues.

But I want to answer this comment:<p>There's a reason why we sometimes shouldn't compromise. A LOT of powers in this world are just waiting for the opportunity to use the good ol' ""foot in the door"" strategy, especially with free/ open source software. Richard Stall, hate it or love it, with the GPL license has found a way to prevent it. So, in that case there is no compromise, and he's right.<p>There's also a reason with Free/Open source software are now a subject of philosophical research, and your lack of understanding of the forces at play is a good example why some people, the author of this post in question, should stop to look at open source softwares through the ""is it conveniant for me?"" lens.<p>God, the eternal september syndrom is so strong with Open Source software!...",1331755023

3705044,comment,3702827,3702827,3,0,netzpirat,,,"I do test almost anything in my apps and I can't imagine to write my software without it nowadays. I test my Ruby code in the backend, the CoffeeScript code in the frontend and I have integration tests to verify that the whole stack works fine.<p>It took me a lot of effort to learn it properly, I have read many books about testing, have read the tests of plenty of open source software to see how others do it and I wrote thousands of wrong tests until I got at a stage where I can say I have mastered testing.<p>I was always fascinated about test driven development, but to be honest, it does not work for me and I seldom do it. In most cases I normally write new functionality, then I describe the behavior of it and finally do some refactoring until the code quality meet my needs. When you can refactor a class without breaking a single test, you know you've done it right.<p>It's important that you find your way and don't try to follow the rules from others. Take your time, mastering software testing is a complex discipline and it won't happen overnight.<p>Even with a high level of test coverage, I always encounter new bugs when using the software. But after fixing it and adding some tests, I know at least that I will not see the exact same bug again.<p>I believe that writing tests speeds up my development. This may seems illogical at first, but without the tests my development would slow down with increasing complexity (Lehman's Law), and instead of adding new functionality I'd find myself fixing old stuff. So testing allows me to manage a large and complex codebase, it allows me to do a complicated architectural refactoring and I know everything important still works as expected.",1331754925

The fact that they're funded without a product mandate means that they have a nice safety net so instead of pivoting a product and trying to fix what they have, they ""shoot it in the head"" and move on. There's no incentive to try to make what they have work. This isn't discipline, discipline is about making the hard choices and its easy to put  a product out to pasture, its in fact the opposite. There's no reason to be disciplined when you're just playing with other people's money.<p>This is pretty much the opposite of what YC does which is give a smart team just enough money to live and make them fend for themselves.

3705032,comment,3704679,3704950,12,0,hollerith,,,"Unlike Debian, Arch Linux has what they call a ""rolling release schedule,"" which means that the only choices you have are (1) refrain from using Pacman at all to update your software, which of course leaves security vulnerabilities unpatched and (2) opening yourself up to major changes to major subsystems, like Gnome, any time you use pacman to update your system.<p>In contrast, on Debian, major changes to e.g. Gnome are mostly limited to when a new version of Debian comes out, and you get a lot of leeway as to when to upgrade to the new version, and in particular, sometimes you have the option of subscribing to just the security patches for your version of Debian -- an option that Arch Linux just does not offer at all.<p>And I got the impression that updates of Arch Linux broke things that required my manual intervention to fix more than updates of Debian did.<p>Still it is a very compelling distribution because of its ""elegance"".<p>I probably spend just as much time maintaining my OS X box as I did maintaining my Arch Linux box: e.g., when I upgraded from Leopard to Snow Leopard and from Snow Leopard to Lion, I had to install a bunch of stuff (a dict client, Gnu coreutils, Carbon Emacs, even wget IIRC) to get a comfortable environment, and the installation took a lot more time than it would have on a Linux distro.  E.g., the upgrade to OS X 10.7.3 changed the behavior of sleep mode such that simply bumping the mouse wakes the system, which eliminates most of the value I used to get from putting the system to sleep, so now I have to ask on some forum for a way to revert to the OS X 10.7.2 behavior of waking only on key press or mouse button click.",1331754822

The functions in `gs`, on the other hand, print 0 through 4, as they ""should"" because the `i` in `g` is assigned to the object currently referenced by the `for` loop's `i` each time the `def` statement is evaluated. This distinction in behavior is obscured in the classic function-inside-a-function example of closures because you pass the object to be closed over to the outer function each time you want to create a new closure. So the result is analogous to using the default-argument trick in the example above.<p>Anyway, that's all I meant to point out.

It's easy for us to see that the legal system is fucked up, but hard to be honest about our own field when our interests start conflicting. We talk ad nauseam about patents and engineering techniques, but have comparatively little discussion about the ethics of proprietary software. It's easy to just kinda take it for granted. And when rms does come up, these ad hominems are usually about as far as it goes. There's a line from Mad Men, ""nobody knows what's wrong with themselves, and everyone else can see it right away.""<p>rms isn't a businessman or a politician, he's a ""prophet"". However secular his beliefs, he sacrifices for his convictions (not that he has a ""side"", this isn't a sport!). He's in the tradition of Jesus, Luther, Copernicus. Their ideas threatened the orthodoxies of their time; what kept the money-changers in the temple, the Church profiting from indulgences and remaining the scientific authority. It wasn't a pity that Jesus waged peace on war, that Luther called bullshit on indulgences, or that Copernicus proved Earth went around Sun. If they'd've chosen otherwise, in retrospect, what good would it have done?<p>If Jesus led a rebellion against Rome, or Copernicus didn't publish, or, I don't know, Luther embraced the printing press + surplus cloth to trail-blaze the romance novel...<p>Their common enemy was ignorance, and history's been shaped by those who didn't compromise on what they knew mattered. That doesn't mean we all have to! I'm no prophet. I write proprietary software.

However, in real code, we sometimes have to model situations and solve problems that are inherently complex. The algorithms and data structures we work with will necessarily reflect that essential complexity, and ultimately so will our code.<p>Beyond a certain point, I think automated tests that give simple yes/no answers are no longer a particularly effective way to test certain types of complex algorithm. Sometimes there are just too many possible inputs and interactions between different effects to get a sensible level of coverage and draw any useful conclusions from that kind of testing alone. You might still have some automated tests, but they are more like integration tests than unit tests at that point.<p>Internally, you could try writing almost-unit-tests for the implementation details, but then you get into the usual concerns about backdoor access and tying tests too closely to implementation details that might change frequently. Alternatively, some form of careful algorithm design with systematic formal proof might be called for. Maybe instrumenting the code and checking the actual values at key points will highlight errors that aren't yet manifesting as faults, things that a boolean automated test would miss because they haven't violated some arbitrary threshold but which form an unexpected pattern to a knowledgable human observer. However, in these cases, you really want the code to be as simple as possible, and hooks to permit internal access to run some automated test cases as well could cause an awful lot of clutter.",1331752583

You end up meeting more people that way, seeing familiar faces, and getting more done. Every year I've been there I've gotten things done more quickly (business deals, press meetings, customer feedback) simply because of the sheer volume of people there.<p>The key is to pick a spot to camp out at, and invite people to meet you there. It creates stability and easy collaboration. I am always surprised by the new and old people I run into there. Easier than spending a week or month going back and forth on E-mails trying to meet.<p>Allowing serendipity to run it's course is quite efficient. The creativity comes from the conversations and living knowledge in small groups and hangout sessions vs. the panels and the ads. There are many layers to big events like this.",1331752064

What's the price of a gallon of gasoline up to in Europe now, $9 or something? I think most of the time it is something like triple what the US pays.<p>And yet that has not crippled the European economies when it comes to trade with the US. European cars are more gasoline efficient, and Europeans live closer together (although this may largely also be due to historic reason long predating the automobile).<p>And I think the fear that oil might be radically more expensive for everyone, unless someone ensures it keeps flowing, is unfounded. If oil is valuable - people will look to sell it.<p>Didn't certain groups in Iraq partly fund themselves by exporting oil in pickup trucks? That's what I mean. Even if an oil exporting area turns to complete and utter chaos, strong men will arise and they will look to get rich by selling oil. And how long could the oil exporting states maintain their quality of life without massive oil exports?<p>I think you'd have to actively fight to prevent oil from trading rather than the other way around.<p>But it is also true that Europe might look radically different if the US had not pushed for democracy in the west.<p>That's what's really so depressing about the US and the rest of the world slowly sliding towards more and more authoritarianism.

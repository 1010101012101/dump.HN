Not the only way I debug but it has its place.<p>One consulting project involved 900 modules in 200 directories. I opened modules and skimmed through, and the bugs were just everywhere. (No, not false-positives. Once flagged, you can read carefully and prove the bug).  I abandoned that source base as unredeemable and wrote a simple 10-module driver to replace it. (The customer rejected it, couldn't believe I could be right. They hired somebody else, the product was cancelled and recalled 9 months later).",1320760799

3210698,comment,3209385,3209724,1,0,mmcconnell1618,,,"I've always found arguments about fixed-pie vs. variable interesting. Let's assume that each person has a limited potential value they can create. We'll all die at some point (unless the singularity is near) and we can boost our potential limit with things like technology, education, bio-tech, etc. But, in the end, each person has a limit to the value they can create. You could also argue that when people collaborate they can increase their potential yet again but there are limits.<p>If there are limits to the total potential a person can create then I would argue that fixing up a car in your yard is creating value but it is only the difference between what your true potential value contribution is and what you're actually doing (i.e. watching TV instead).<p>To me, it seems like the only way the pie gets bigger is through population growth or the multipliers I described earlier (tech, education). I would argue that although in the long term wealth is growing, in the short term it acts very much like a fixed-pie game. If the richest 1% are capturing wealth >= the rate of increase in the pie then those who aren't capturing it feel as though things are fixed and they are losing out.",1320760346

There are tons of software solutions for greylisting.<p>Some require manual approval first time. Some sends a message back to ask the sender to do something (anything from just clicking a link to entering a captcha) and relies on you to do manual approval now and again (to catch automated but valid messages).<p>Some just defers delivery and waits for a second delivery attempt (because most spammers practice ""fire and forget"" and just ignores errors). Our office mail server is in the latter category - first time someone e-mails us,a second delivery attempt needs to happen after 10 minutes for the message to get through (it's ok if there are attempts in between too, but the assumption is that most of even the few spammers that retry will go away too quickly to send another attempt after 10 minutes).

3210592,comment,3209690,3209732,4,0,ahadrana,,,"Hi, I work at commoncrawl, so I will try to answer your question. We store our crawl data on S3 in the form of 100MB compressed archives and there are between 40,000 and 50,000 such files in commoncrawls bucket today. The key to scanning such a large set of files efficiently on EC2 is to have your each of your Mappers (assuming you are running Hadoop) open multiple S3 streams in parallel to maintain some desired level of throughput. For example, assuming that you can maintain on average a 1MByte/sec throughput per S3 stream, and you start 10 parallel streams per Mapper, you should be able to sustain a throughput 80 Mbits/sec or 10 MBytes/sec. If you were to run one Mapper per EC2 small instance, and start 100 such instances, this would yield and aggregated throughput of close to 3TB/hour. At that rate, you would need 16 hours to scan 50TB of data, or a total of 1600 machine hours at $.085 per hour, costing you somewhere in the neighborhood of $130.00. Of course, you would then need to add in the cost of running any subsequent aggregation / data consolidation jobs and the cost of storing your final data on S3. So, the $100.00 number is generally in the ballpark but final numbers may vary :-)<p>As far as comparisons to Yahoo BOSS are concerned, no, we are definitely not comparable to Yahoo BOSS or other such APIs that run on top of an already built (and properly ranked) inverted index of the web. At this stage we only produce bulk snapshots of what we crawl, and we are focusing our engineering resources on improving the frequency and coverage of crawl (the results of which will hopefully start to bear fruit in early 2012). Perhaps at some point in the near future, we can partner with the community to build a rudimentary full-text inverted index of the Web that we can make available in bulk via S3 as well.",1320758449

I would like to meet my true love, become famous throughout the world, and live a good live with my family.""<p>It seems like the two pages were written by different people.<p>These are the comments on my blog with these translations:

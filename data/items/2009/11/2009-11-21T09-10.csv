954388,comment,954271,954271,0,0,illumen,,,"Looks interesting.  I like that at least one real ISP is using it... it gives me hope that one day it will spread to be a good solution for python apps on cheap web hosts.<p>Also it is good to have a couple of different python extensions for apache.  It keeps them all on their toes.<p>I'm not sure the GPL licence makes sense for this project though.  It means that to use it, people have to use the GPL for their web apps... or pay/negotiate a different licence.  Well, maybe getting people to pay for it is their intention.<p>The protocol uses a 16bit length headers... meaning it will fail for big payloads.  That turned me off investigating it out any further.  However it is likely not a problem.",1258797557
954386,comment,953760,954259,0,0,derefr,,,"Sure, but that's because, in today's society, fucking one goat is <i>virtually unknown</i>—not because it doesn't happen, but because it <i>goes unmentioned</i>. The first John-the-goat-fucker to be caught by the panopticon might be arrested, but the 9128th? Probably not. When we look at the population curves we'd build from this data and extrapolate that, throughout history, John himself was likely the <i>340-thousandth</i> or so in his series, we might even let him out, too.<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that when all information is public to the finest of grains, causality is quite easy to infer. This dataset would be any psychiatrist's dream; it's a perfect, objective record of everything that happened to a person, to contrast against their subjective interpretations of events, and infer the causalities of their influences. When Clippy pops up to some poor sod in 2048 saying ""by my interpretation of your recent actions, it looks like you may soon develop an urge to fuck a goat! It'd probably be a good idea to talk to a therapist, even if you don't feel like you need to,"" I'm guessing truly <i>unethical</i> behavior will take a nosedive. Anyone who's comfortable with everyone else knowing they feel that way about a goat, however, will likely be free to go ahead—since every action will be an intrinsic, quite-visible scarlet letter, there will be no need for any external punishment mechanism.<p>(This is assuming, of course, that we get global immigration policies worked out by then, so that people born in an environment that don't agree with its mores, no matter where that may be, can leave for a place which does.)",1258797302

Even Gruber doesn't think there is anyone right now who only needs one or two bikes.<p>Apparently the world consists only of people with two computers. Nobody has a single computer that is overseeving their needs and it is inconcievable that there are people who simply haven't bought one yet, perhaps because they are overwhelmed by their complexity.",1258797146

I don't have numbers on BSD developers or the rate of improvement, but I guess one reason for it is that BSD license put off more developers compared to GPLv2.",1258796470

They must be small to be carry-able. I believe in a future where mobile devices will be more ubiquitous, and where specific tasks (like development) would be delegated to ""static"" machines.<p>In the future, mobile devices will be more like a <i>magic wand</i> than a workstation. We would enable functionalities in different ""static"" devices with the same mobile device.<p>Also, you ask :
 How could you make a device programmers liked better than the iPhone?<p>I would suggest : make an open device for less that $100 and you will win. Now we know that <i>price is a feature</i>. No need for a big touch screen.",1258796209

However, this intelligence does not translate directly to the <i>type</i> of intelligence humans are accustomed to (in terms of social interactions and activities) and as such is commonly disregarded by those that don't specifically know and love to work with dogs (and cats, who are also of extreme intelligence).",1258795986

although I don't use a database here,  the blog is saved directly to
disk (<a href=""http://github.com/l0stman/Blog"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/l0stman/Blog</a>).<p>The biggest hurdle with Common Lisp is configuring the system
correctly because there's no out of the box solution.  Although
there's a lot of library -- <a href=""http://www.cliki.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cliki.net</a> is a great resource
-- figuring out how to use asdf-install is a bit painful.  I took me
almost four days to figure out how to launch Hunchentoot as a daemon
at startup under FreeBSD

server itself lays behind nginx as a proxy.  The latter serves the
static pages too.  Here's nginx's configuration:<p><pre><code>     server {
        listen       80;
        server_name  localhost;

        location / {
            root   /usr/local/www/nginx;

            try_files $uri.html $uri/index.html $uri $uri.txt @fallback;
        }

        location @fallback {
            return 404;

        # redirect server error pages to the static page /50x.html
        #
        error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
            root   /usr/local/www/nginx-dist;
        }

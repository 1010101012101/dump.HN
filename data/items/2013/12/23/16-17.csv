6955204,comment,6954112,6954833,3,0,king_jester,,,"> ~18% of fathers are the custodial parent. Shared custody favors the mothers in most circumstances.<p>This is correct, the overall rate is low. However, this doesn&#x27;t take into account rates of fathers seeking custody. About 50% of fathers seeking primary custody in divorce cases are granted such custody. It should be noted that fathers generally do not see primary custody as frequently as women in these cases, which skews the overall rate.<p>> 60% of of fathers (regardless of custodial status) are required to pay child support to the mother.<p>I don&#x27;t dispute this. However, rates of payout are different from legal obligation to pay. Any person, man or woman, receiving child support are more likely to only receive some partial sum of child support, if any. Moreover, there is already income inequality for women in general in the US, this will have a bearing on whether or not fathers, who are statistically more likely to be better paid, have to pay child support.<p>> On average, women are awarded more child support than men -- Women also receive 85% of all child support paid every year.<p>As you yourself noted, women are much more likely to be performing primary custody and care for a child, we would then expect that women receive more child support then men in such an arrangement. As I mentioned before, this is a bit misleading as many people don&#x27;t receive full amounts of child support or have some kind of informal support arrangement that is not court ordered.<p>> Then why are we pushing campaigns to teach men not to rape but not women? Why are colleges around the US putting students through rape awareness education only telling men not to rape?<p>Rape and sexual assault is overwhelmingly committed by men. Prevention messages and campaigns are targeted this way for this reason. That is not to say that they deny that women can commit sexual assault, but rather that a primary problem is behaviors committed by people who are men. Campaigns that focus on women&#x27;s behavior are not addressing this fact.<p>> As for redefinitions, feminists pushed for the recent FBI expansion that makes forced fallatio rape but not forced cunnilingus.<p>This is not true. The new summary of the change for the FBI includes: &quot;or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without\nthe consent of the victim&quot;.<p>> They also pushed for the definition to be forced penetration by the accused, excluding cases where a man is forced to penetrate by the women.<p>The FBI definition still has problems, for sure. It focuses far too much on penetration as rape rather than non-consensual sexual contact. However, there were a wide variety of voices, feminist and not, that noted this when the FBI made its change and are continuing to call for more change. Like I said, there are many voices in feminism, some of which call for things that are shortsighted or don&#x27;t make sense. To claim that this is wholly representative of feminism is what creates a strawman.<p>> Please tell me more about derailing by insulting.<p>As a man you do not face systematic discrimination and power imbalance due to your gender, that is why I mentioned it. When someone complains about men online, you are not seriously impacted due to your gender.<p>> As usual, those voices (despite being some prolific and vocal, really being the face of feminism today) are No True Scotsman&#x27;ed out of being feminists.<p>I made no such fallacy. Those voices exist and are associated with feminism. However, they are not the total representation of feminist voices and to make it seem as though they are is not talking about serious issues in good faith.",1387817876

First, build a list of denier organizations based on anyone who has ever been remotely associated with known climate-deniers. This includes being labeled a conservative organization. Second, classify the organizations on a scale that categorizes anyone who neither remains totally silent nor actively encourages immediate government action as some form of denier. Third, pull all the publicly available funding data you can find on those organizations since 2003 and attribute it all to climate change denial.<p>Lots of these organizations are almost totally focused on non-climate change issues. There is no attempt made to figure out what fraction of their revenue might actually support climate change work, if any. (It would be difficult, given how little data 990s provide, but there are proxy measurements: number of staff working on climate change relative to total staff, number of climate change studies relative to total studies, etc.) Instead, if an organization so much as expresses some small doubt that immediate government action is the best solution to climate change problems, all of their revenues for years are considered to deny climate change.<p>This study is like the Glenn Beck chalkboard of climate change denial conspiracies.",1387817868

In hindsight now, I would never hire myself. Either you&#x27;re a developer, in which case you should be able to traverse that stack (so for example JS as well as PHP/Ruby/Python) or you&#x27;re a designer, and you can traverse that stack (so you design, implement your designs in HTML/CSS, maybe a little JS as necessary). But while there is crossover between the two domains, there isn&#x27;t a separate role in the middle. Trying to fit development workflow around people who just do HTML/CSS/JS ends up creating too many bottlenecks, on both sides: &quot;I&#x27;m waiting for designer A to deliver X&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m waiting for back-end person B to deliver Y&quot;.

This means there is a 60bps fee to go from an actual currency to bitcoin and vice versa.

Prohibition was repealed, as was inhibition, and bank holidays last all year. They have worked too hard and too long to get the public under such great control as it is today, and we would do the depression so much better than the 30&#x27;s did. &#x27;TALKIN&#x27; BOUT A REVOLUTION&#x27; my friends.",1387817447

6955126,comment,6953774,6953774,5,0,ChristianMarks,,,"There is a calculational school of programming in which algorithms are derived from specifications in a presentation of first-order logic adapted to program derivation. It does not seem to be popular on HN. <i>&quot;Programming: the derivation of algorithms&quot;</i> by Anne Kaldewaij is a good source for this. A derivation of an efficient algorithm to compute Fibonacci numbers is given, as well as for me the most memorable implementation of binary search.<p>Miller should have used Kaldewaij&#x27;s O(log(N)) algorithm to compute the n-th Fibonacci number, given below.<p><pre><code>  def fib(n):\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;Lifted from Kaldewaij.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n    a,b,x,y = 0,1,0,1\n    while n != 0:\n      if n % 2 == 0:\n        a,b = a * a + b * b, 2 * a * b + b * b\n        n = n // 2\n      else:\n        x,y = a * x + b * y, b * x + a * y + b * y\n        n -= 1\n    return x\n</code></pre>\nAs Kaldewaij remarks, the algorithm is harder to understand without its derivation.<p>Of course there is TAOCP by Knuth, who added a supplement on probability to the mathematical preliminaries.<p>Miller&#x27;s suggestion that programmers should know calculus, statistics and linear algebra is sound, though perhaps pedestrian. There is no end to the mathematics one might apply. The article omits logic and dependent type theory. The Curry-Haskell-Lambek isomorphism theorem on the equivalence between the category of cartesian closed categories and functors and the category of simply-typed lambda calculi and translations is basic in the study of functional programming languages.  Ramsey&#x27;s theorem has been applied to program termination. I myself am interested in applications of game theory--though I am not giving away my secrets.",1387817188

In response to the question: &quot;what do you want?&quot; the DOD&#x27;s response is often: &quot;what could we have?&quot; Pointing at how much more efficient private industry is makes no sense. Take an example like Space X. They&#x27;re a shining example of private industry, and are doing very innovative stuff, but they&#x27;re treading a lot of the same ground NASA and DOD contractors did in the 1960&#x27;s.

In a previous company we hired developers with good CS chops but no iOS experience to build our iPhone app - they picked it up, but it took a couple of years and numerous rewrites to get an awesome product. Thats a huge opportunity cost. You&#x27;ll end up with a better product right off the bat if you hire an expert, especially with technologies which have a ton of quirks and nuances.<p>So why wouldn&#x27;t you want to hire a front-end expert? In a lot of smaller companies flexibility can trump expertise - having an engineer who is smart and can work across the entire stack is essential in smaller teams. That doesn&#x27;t mean they won&#x27;t be primarily doing front-end development, but its helpful if they know their way around the back-end to some extent without hand-holding from other engineers. A good candidate needs to be smart enough to quickly pickup new tools and techniques, and it is important to determine this in the interview process.",1387815065

We just cant handle gov&#x27;t officials and contractors making a ton of money. The real root of the complexity in govt contracting is FAR (Federal Acquisition Regulations) Which create the complexity to avoid egregious corruption and profits in the federal space.

Redundancy, arcane billing practices and auditing, and huge bureaucratic RFP bidding systems that limit competition.

Assigning the exact same values and rights to cockroaches/jellyfish/ants as we do to humans is ludicrous. Any number of moral thought experiments should immediately demonstrate how absurd that would be (e.g. would you refuse to sacrifice 2 ants to save 1 human?).<p>You&#x27;ve misunderstood anti-speciesism. Anti-speciesism means that &quot;moral worth&quot; is not determined <i>at all</i> by species. It <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> mean that all individuals have the same &quot;moral worth&quot;. In other words, if we find a new species which is pretty much identical to humans in terms of age, intelligence etc., they should be roughly equal in moral worth to humans even if they&#x27;re from a different species.<p>Another key point in non-speciesism is the argument that &quot;it&#x27;s just an animal&quot;. Species shouldn&#x27;t be used in ethical arguments. Anti-speciesism doesn&#x27;t mean that intelligence, ability to feel pain, average lifespan and so on have no place in moral discussions. Of course they do. I would sacrifice two ants to save one human if that increase utility (because I happen to be anti-speciesist person who belives in something close to utiliarianism).<p>Another thought experiment would be comparing a severely mentally disabled child and a chimpanzee of equal intelligence and predicted lifespan.

Somewhat irrelevant. He committed genocide, if he hadn&#x27;t had the opportunity he may not have done. So what?<p>>> <i>But where did I say that&#x27;s not genocidal or Nazi?</i><p>>> <i>&quot;Your statements (&quot;deliberate Genocide&quot;) make it clear you&#x27;re simply not getting the point Fromm is making.&quot;</i>\n>> <i>&quot;To go from &quot;Eichmann&quot; to &quot;Nazi&quot; and from there to any aspect of the Nazis you equate them with, instead of going by what Fromm means in context, is such a waste of time.&quot;</i><p>You&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s not right to say he was a Nazi, and not right to go from there to calling him genocidal simply because of that. I&#x27;m not calling him genocidal because of that, I&#x27;m doing it because of his actions.<p>And to be very clear, I understand entirely the point Fromm is making (lack of empathy is the root of Eichmann&#x27;s actions and if you don&#x27;t lose your appetite when reading about hunger you lack empathy, this puts you on the same spectrum as Eichmann). I understand and I disagree, vehemently.<p>To really hammer this home, your very first post about Fromm quoted - &quot;As soon as you have not lost your appetite, when you knew other people were starving, then your heart has hardened, and in principle, you have done the same which Eichmann did.&quot; Eichmann organised and supervised genocide. This is not simple lack of empathy, and neither does keeping your appetite demonstrate a total lack of empathy. The argument is wrong at both ends.<p>>> <i>I said that&#x27;s not the point of why Fromm is making the comparison - lack of empathy is.</i><p>And if you think lack of empathy was all Eichmann had going then you&#x27;re pretty delusional, IMHO.<p>>> <i>He doesn&#x27;t mean if we don&#x27;t loose our appetite when others starve, we grow round glasses and and clothes from the 40s, and many other things. He doesn&#x27;t mean we will start putting people in box cars.</i><p>Then why make the comparison? It&#x27;s hyperbolic in the extreme and basically a Godwin violation.<p>>> <i>To ridicule my supposed lack of reading comprehension considering this whole string of completely useless attacks on strawmen, is kinda rich.</i><p>You misread something and childishly posted a link to the definition of analogy as if I might never have heard of it. I&#x27;m sorry I shot back at you, I hope you didn&#x27;t find it too offensive.<p>>> <i>Your reaction that Eichmann is completely beyond the pale of any comparison is kinda fitting.</i><p>No, not really. Eichmann&#x27;s crime is substantially different from a simple lack of empathy, as I&#x27;ve said many times now, he was actively involved in some of the worst evil we know of. It may well be that many/all people are capable of this level of evil. However that still doesn&#x27;t mean that failing to respond in a simplistic, set way to an empathic situation is anything like organising the deaths of hundreds of thousands of jewish people. It&#x27;s not the same principle, it&#x27;s not the same root to the action, and I fundamentally disagree that a lack of empathy and a set of orders was the driver behind Eichmann&#x27;s actions. And yes, I am familiar with Milgram.<p>>> <i>The second is also &quot;not showing empathy in a specific way&quot;. And no, I do not want to play games.</i><p>It&#x27;s a lot more than that.<p>>> <i>I acknowledged that before. But that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it consists of many aspects, one of them lack of empathy.</i><p>But if that&#x27;s only one aspect, the analogy is about as useful as saying &quot;You know who else had a moustache like that?&quot; as happens on fark.com, except here you seem to want to be taken seriously whereas over there everyone knows it&#x27;s a joke.",1387814755

What had he done in Lisp? Yegge? Mostly an Emacs user with Emacs Lisp usage. Unfortunately his Lisp knowledge mostly ends with Emacs Lisp. Yegge would not recognize a Lisp, even if you hit him with Lisp Machine Manual over the head. Only Graham was and is a real Lisp user and hacker. OTOH there are too many Lisp and mathematics users.<p>Actually if there is a language with Mathematics background, then it is Lisp.<p>People like McCarthy, Minsky, Sussman are/were mathematicians.<p>The MIT Lisp hacker culture had lots of mathematicians from Joel Moses to Bill Gosper.<p>Lisp spawned symbolic mathematics which has been used in all kinds of areas with thousands of applications.<p>Macsyma, Axiom, Reduce, Derive and several other Lisp written maths applications have been used in many applications. The whole AI domain is based on all kinds of diverse mathematics written in Lisp: logic, statistics, probability theory, neural networks, signal processing, ...<p>Even students who are reading SICP are usually complaining that most of the examples are math related.<p>Let&#x27;s see some actual Lisp applications:<p>* <a href=\"http://www.lispworks.com/success-stories/netfonds-primetrader.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.lispworks.com/success-stories/netfonds-primetrade...</a>\n  Real Time Stock trading.

Tesla has shown good faith in building up the infrastructure for fast charging and demonstrating battery swapping technology, even if the infrastructure for battery swap is not yet there. They have picked up the slack where the government has failed to provide infrastructure. Surely carbon credits were designed to incentivize this kind of innovation and manufacturing, and as far as I can see Tesla is the best example of a company that stands a chance of bringing fast charging electric vehicles with battery swap technology to the mass market . In short, the carbon credits system is working, it is incentivizing the kidn of innovation we need.<p>This person has a political axe to grind and a personal agenda....apparently because they are a climate change denier.",1387814408

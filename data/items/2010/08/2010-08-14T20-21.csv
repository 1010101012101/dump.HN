1604026,comment,1603869,1603869,0,0,tptacek,,,"This post is a useful rundown on where threads stand in Ruby now, but it hangs on a bit of a straw man argument. The argument for evented concurrency assumes threads <i>work</i>. Async design isn't a reaction to MRI's crappy green threads.<p>It's also not a very compelling argument for threading to say ""web programs don't share a lot of state, so you don't have to worry about synchronization"". If all you do are CRUD apps, you can indeed punt scaling to the database. That doesn't mean threads are more effective than events; it means you made concurrency and synchronization someone else's problem. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's not a convincing demonstration of threading.",1281819558

When you continue the playback, one of the other students will also formulate the sentence in German.  Then the teacher will correct them if they're wrong, and repeat the correct sentence (with correct pronunciation).

Given the ~28,000 drug-war-related deaths in Mexico over the last 4 years, I can see why he might be considering alternatives. The previous president, Vicente Fox, enthusiastically endorsed the idea a couple of days later. Retired officeholders can afford to be more bold than when they were in the hot seat, but it came as a big surprise to me to see a sitting president put the idea on the table.<p>Surprisingly, this news made barely a ripple in the US media...then again, coverage of Mexican affairs here is not that good, and even discussing legalization is political suicide in most of the US.

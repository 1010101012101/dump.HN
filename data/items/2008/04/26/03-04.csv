Best move ever since I was on the fence about school and working with my uncle at a sewer and drain cleaning business (and plumbing too) gave me a great reality check.<p>I then went to a state school where, except for one semester, I worked full time and school full time for 2.5 years (1 $4,500 student loan only and about $2k in credit card debt + a car loan).  I got an offer for a $35k a year job in Dallas through a friend and quit my $7.50 an hour job the next week.<p>Took another semester off and then continued taking classes in the evenings and weekends at a community college and local commuter college.<p>When I finally graduated it was basically a non-event for me (didn't walk or send announcements) since I realixed I'd just paid $30k for a piece of paper that is a one liner on my resume and that really didn't teach me much.<p>So, like I tell lots of people these days, take the basics at a community college, take the upper level classes at a college and just get the paper since unless you're going into the hedge fund business or med/law school noone cares about your grades, just that you have a degree.<p>Of course if you own your own business, noone cares about a degree :)",1209179825

174131,comment,174064,174064,0,0,jrockway,,,"It looks like applications are vulnerable if they blindly stick the attacker-supplied data into the query.  The difference between this and the usual variety is that it also gets past things that strip single quotes and then put the data into the query.<p>You would have to really go out of your way to be vulnerable to this.  You would have to build your query like:<p><pre><code>    ""SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bar=$user_supplied_data""\n</code></pre>\nwhich I think we can all agree is retarded.  Even the worst programmers I know at least write something like:<p><pre><code>    $user_supplied_data =~ s/'/''/g;\n    ""SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bar='$user_supplied_data'"";\n</code></pre>\n(although PHP and not Perl ;)  But of course using bindvars is the easiest and most correct solution.<p>It always amazes me how people go out of their way to write code that's more complicated and less secure.

I've compromised my quality standards on every genre of music except classical music, which I still revert back to my CD collection.  Sadly, I feel classical's aging audience hasn't created the forcing function for that industry to get organized regarding the categorization and distribution of their catalogue online, which is a damn shame.  Having said that, it takes a certain tuned ear to pick out the world of difference in the performance and interpretation between pieces that are compositionally identical.  I personally feel you need a certain threshold of fidelity to distinguish those subtleties.<p>Because of this, I find I listen to less and less classical music over the years, simple because CD device players are starting to disappear from my life. For example, I'm typing on a laptop right now that doesn't even have a CD drive (Macbook Air).  I literally have to go out of my way to listen to classical music in the way I want to hear it.

4081276,comment,4078334,4079923,5,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>Are things different from a developer perpective? If so, why?</i><p>Broadly speaking, because the credit card industry is a massive, bloated, inefficient mess, and the effort and liability required for a small business to participate in that mess directly can literally be business-destroying. And that's assuming the Powers That Be graciously allow you to play their little game at all, which may take several weeks of approval process to decide, and will almost certainly come with silly levels of fees on each transaction and terms so one-sided they could right a sinking ship even if you do jump through all of their hoops.<p>Having an intermediary that can provide a simple API that just works instead of having to integrate with some absurdly complicated and poorly documented API offered directly by the big players can save weeks of hassle. Similarly, having an intermediary that can take care of compliance with the dreaded PCI DSS (the industry security standards) is also a huge win. Finally, because the intermediaries tend to be bigger fish in the pond, you will often get a significantly better deal out of them in terms of how quickly you get your money, and how much of your money you actually get to keep.<p>All of this is particularly true for start-ups with no trading history, which of course will include just about any new on-line business. Once you've got a proven track record you can give solid answers to the financial questions and actually make the big boys compete for your business as they should, at least to some extent, but if you're starting from zero then the first thing a lot of these companies see is a huge potential fraud risk, particularly if you're in any kind of ""dubious"" industry or, again like many on-line SaaS businesses, you want to use a continuous payment authority to take recurring payments from a customer's card and not just a one-off transaction.<p>Unfortunately, there has to be some sort of big player on the other side of any intermediary (or, possibly, several big players used for different kinds of transaction) and so it's not unusual for these intermediaries either to be limited in geographic scope or to provide a partial service but still require you to sort out your own connections with a payment gateway and/or merchant account based in your region (though the intermediaries will probably be able to help with that process, which is still better than nothing). Thus while the US appears to have an effective and fast-growing young industry in payment processing services, those of us in other regions can only look on with jealousy and bow down before the mighty PayPal/Google/other vast multinational with a self-contained payment service.",1339102444

I agree it is unreasonable to expect a random developer to build AND MAINTAIN the entire stack for every project.  PaaS makes a lot of sense, especially as a starting place.<p>The solution is either to have a PaaS provider who ruthlessly eliminates single points of failure (there isn't one, currently), or use some standardized software system which can be operated by multiple independent operators with nothing shared.  Unfortunately, the only vendor-independent infrastructure is the physical server, various forms of VPS, etc. -- it's all at the IaaS level.

By the time you are 26 with 15 years of coding, you will still, no doubt, be among the top 1% of developers your age.  I agree with the other comments about finishing high school, but in your free time, focus less on developing and instead focus on expanding your horizons by talking to people who are different from you.  Who cares if you drop to only top 10% of developers your age by the time you are 26? Do you think most people who have the money to fund you can tell or care? Ideally if you come up with a brilliant startup, 2-3 years in, you shouldn't even be coding anymore.<p>I was in India last year for my developer's wedding (He operates out of India and...that was the first time we ever met face to face) and from the conversations with his friends, it was strange for me to learn that entrepreneurship on a resume is looked down upon by companies there.  Basically, once you quit your job to start your own startup, there is no turning back to corporate life.  So I can imagine the wall you are running into.  But here is my suggestion, expand your understanding beyond your own personal world by talking to people who don't share the same background as you.  There are hostels or places where backpackers from other countries hangout at in your city.  Go talk to them and listen to their perspectives on anything and everything (backpackers love talking to locals).  That's where you'll figure out what you can do to help change the world.

This means that the framework is coupled with all of these components and this is the root of all evil in web frameworks. Of course you need a place to do that object creation and wiring work - but it is not really related to web stuff - it should have it's own place in the program, ideally in a Dependency Injection compartment, not necessarily a container based on the available libraries - but it can also be coded by hand (I might change my minde some day but for now I don't see any reasons to use DI container libraries in a dynamic language like Perl). All the arguments about using Dependency Injection apply also here, but even for someone rejecting DI it should be pretty obvious that reading config files and initializing objects is not much related to web stuff and if you buy the single responsibility principle you should split them into separate libraries.<p>I don't know Django or Rails too deeply - but I've observed this with Catalyst. Now, Catalyst is supposed to be decoupled from the Views or Models and other Plugins, there are many different ones in each category and you can replace them freely in your programs. But Catalyst code-base is still pretty big and then you have all these Catalyst::Models, Catalyst::Views and Catalyst::Plugins that don't really do any meaningful work - they only map one interface into another one. It could be much simpler if Catalyst only cared about the web related processing.<p>(copied from my blog)",1339101582

Does a farmer suicide every 30 minutes sound a little high to anyone else? That would be 48 / day or over 17k / year.<p>As for the lawsuit, Monsanto sues a farmer because a farmer's land contains some of Monsanto's product. Fine, their product is essentially DNA, but they're allowed to call it their product. Fighting the patent is a losing fight. Right or wrong, it's a battle that won't be won until Kucinich is in the White House.<p>I've wondered why farmers don't file a counter-claim of trespassing since Monsanto allowed or caused their agents (both the patented DNA and whomever discovered the Monsanto plant) to enter a farmer's property. Additionally, it seems like there would be a case for destruction of property since the genetically modified seeds and plants crowd out the farmer's seeds and plants. Lastly, if the farmers really wanted to hit Monsanto with some irony, they should sue to have Monsanto pay for the removal of the modified seeds and plants. The farmer would have to argue that it is Monsanto's responsibility to prevent the outward spread of their crop. I'm sure the right judge could be found who would draw the comparison to breaking and entering someone's home.<p>But I'm reminded of a couple simple facts. You don't have to be right to sue someone. You don't have to be in the wrong to get sued. Win or loose, it's not cheap to go to court.",1339101394

   and deflate with persistent context is a good approach to achieve
   it. A fixed dictionary is probably not very effective as it
   complicates the implementation while only providing initial value to
   the compression. As an example, this is how the average requests
   sizes compares between HTTP and SPDY in different modes, using the
   set of captured headers used to train the current SPDY 3 dictionary.

     HTTP                             821.1
     HTTP zlib compressed             543.5
     HTTP compressed with dictionary  497.0
     SPDY                             913.7
     SPDY zlib compressed             606.5
     SPDY compressed with dictionary  517.0

   I.e. Just putting the HTTP request in a SPDY stream (after removing
   disallowed headers) only differs by 20 bytes to SPDY binary header
   format with dictionary based zlib compression. The benefit of using
   a dictionary basically goes away entirely on the subsequent request.</code></pre>",1339100435

A moment of respite from the turmoil is all the last two or three years represents. That moment of respite cost between $8 and $15 trillion depending on what you're counting (total deficits + Fed bailouts).<p>In fact, things are far worse today than they were at the height of the crisis, as we've loaded up on $6 or so trillion more in public debt we can never pay back. We've added about $400 to $500 billion more in student loan debt, and a few million college graduates are sitting on the sidelines without jobs and experience, and we've got millions more living on food stamps without jobs.<p>The only thing separating our system from absolute implosion is the global reserve currency that we're currently massively abusing at our leisure. If mortgage rates had to rise to their natural rates (absent Fed manipulation holding down both long term and short term rates), housing would quickly plunge another 1/3, and that alone would rupture the entire financial system and bring it to its knees.<p>The truth is, we look a lot like the imploding EU zone across the Federal and State levels.

If anything, a focus towards developing a model that serves people like us will only go towards expanding the market for music sales (i.e. converting would-be pirated downloads to sales).<p>And without going too far-off on a tangent, Id also argue that the market in many ways depends on the minority of high-volume consumers functioning as the early adaptors who discover music and popularize it for the masses.

Complicated, careful work (in nuclear physics or space launches, for instance) generally depends on this, no doubt.<p>But outside those domains -- in a personal blog, for instance, or when noodling catfish in the bayou, say -- splitting infinitives might be ok, or even a shibboleth.

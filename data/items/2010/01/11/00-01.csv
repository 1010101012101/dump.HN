The point of the xkcd strip is that the ants conducted a very shallow test (looking for life that was most similar to theirs) and then gave up. The post I responded to made a similar comment generalizing about the nature of ""the Universe"", which is indicative of the same fallacy.<p>Which is the point of the xkcd strip (the alt-text makes it even more clear). It isn't about ants, ants don't read xkcd. The point is that despite all of what we've done we have barely scratched the surface of knowing or understanding the universe. We are as ignorant of the nature of intelligent life in the universe, even whether it exists outside of Earth or not, as the depicted ants are of human civilization. Far more so, in fact.",1263171561

It's long, but full of gems and interesting talking points.<p><i>>> “I think it would be easy for common-sense Americans to draw up a list of big things that would seem to demand concerted effort. Deficits are too big. Health costs are unacceptable. Oil. And yet we have a political system that seems to be constantly consumed with trivial things. We cannot seriously grapple with the big issues. Tactics consume strategy.</i><p>Probably true, but the question is just how many common-sense Americans do we have? I live in Boston now, but I'm originally from a suburban town in Georgia. When I visit home, people commonly express to me their fears of impending terrorist attacks, their theories about how drugs and atheism are corrupting society, etc. Then these same people hop in their SUVs and drive 90MPH to the nearest McDonald's.<p>Average people don't like to worry about reasonable long-term problems. It's just too boring. They'd rather fret over the remote possibility that some Islamic extremists will fly planes into their homes. Thus, we spend trillions of dollars and thousands of lives fighting in the desert while our economy tanks.<p><i>>>  the most worrisome symptom was the relative shortage of a jeremiad theme under Presidents Clinton, George W. Bush, and now Obama.

None the less it still feels odd to me. This is because when I am searching for an answer to a question on Google, I will usually type in a portion of the answer that I feel would be predictable, To take a random example: ""The population of Iceland is"" (with actual quotes so as to pick up the whole phrase). I don't have a name for this technique (perhaps ""Answer Prediction"" or the ""Reverse Ask Jeeves Technique""), but I usually find it works to my satisfaction. Otherwise, I'm like you, I type in separate keywords that don't make a complete sentence.<p>I have theorised in the past that perhaps the reason some people use the ""Ask Jeeves technique"" while I and others might use the ""Answer Prediction"" technique might be due to me having a clearer general understanding of the way that search engines collect and index their data, i.e. (to oversimplify things for the purpose of illustration) I get that the search engine is just matching text patterns to my query, where as perhaps less technical people don't really understand this and if they think of it at all, they might unconsciously imagine that the Google search page is the interface to some kind of Sky Net like artificial intelligence that is able to take their question, ponder it and provide the most relevant answers.

If not technical then what, philosophical? I never knew that writing a web app required such justification.

Remember that the single most successful kind of web application--the kind which nobody will bat an eye at you for using instead of a desktop application--is email, which is exactly as social regardless of how you access it. There is no ""public, status-seeking"" mindset to web based email that is missing with desktop email. The web is just an interface in that case.

According to Wikipedia: <i>However, there is little direct evidence of the relative proportions of plant and animal foods.[94] According to some anthropologists and advocates of the modern Paleolithic diet, Paleolithic hunter-gatherers consumed a significant amount of meat and possibly obtained most of their food from hunting.[95] Competing hypotheses suggest that Paleolithic humans may have consumed a plant-based diet in general,[58] or that hunting and gathering possibly contributed equally to their diet.[96] One hypothesis is that carbohydrate tubers (plant underground storage organs) may have been eaten in high amounts by our pre-agricultural humans.[97][98][99][100] However, the relative proportions of plant and animal foods in the diets of Paleolithic peoples probably varied between regions. For instance, hunter gatherers in tropical regions such as Africa probably consumed a plant-based diet, while populations in colder regions such as Northern Europe most likely obtained most of their food from meat.[101]</i>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic#Diet_and_nutrition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic#Diet_and_nutrition</a><p>This whole thing smacks of a silly trend among a small group of NY hipsters to sound cool and eat a shit load of meat.",1263170670

He states that the SAT score serves as a ""proxy"" for the resources such students have had available to them in high school and, one would infer, is therefore rigged against middle class and poor students who had lesser quality resources at their disposal.<p>The unstated premise, though, is that elite academic institutions have a social obligation to act affirmatively to equalize outcomes in society by finding alternative ways to qualify students for admission besides the academic capabilities such students demonstrate at the time of applying. Since they have no way of knowing who has what innate merit that may not yet be reflected in academic test scores or historic grades, this <i>ipso facto</i> leads to a system where they have to apply quotas or arbitrary weighting adjustments (e.g., x% upward adjustment in GPA to account for having come from a poor school district) to achieve the equalization sought. Such adjustments will then have the effect of excluding some applicants with higher current performance scores in favor of others with what administrators deem greater unrealized merit, which seems a fairly arbitrary outcome. Whether this would lead to inclusion of more students based on true merit would seem to me to be a dubious proposition but it would decidedly put the schools in the business of trying to iron out social inequalities through admissions standards tied to something other than measurable academic criteria.

Art is always a hard one to define in absolute terms, but the question that makes it easier (I think) is what is left for art? How does one become an artist these days? Is it enough to be purely ornamental? When we have advertising, music video, and graphic design to satisfy those types of creative spirits, what does the artist do to compete as Artist? Also with language in the West in the state it currently is in (words as symbols), art can mean anything to anyone, which is kind of a problem.<p>In the ways science must update its language when the language is polluted by society (cult, idiot, retard, etc), the language that describes creativity might do well with a refresh. I don't know - I look around, and every corner of every room has some genius sitting in a chair. I mean really, is this at all possible, and if so, new words should be invented to distinguish the great genius and just genius. I think the same problem exists when describing what creativity is, because to say it's all art is to say everything is merely art.<p>What I think art has become is a perspective. To be successful in art is to be able to initiate a unique conversation about the world using the Artist's worldview. A craftsperson requires a skill set - the ability to shape matter into an object, but almost nothing more. The artist must use what they create to say something profound. In an environment such as programming, this doesn't seem possible, but I'd love to be proven wrong.

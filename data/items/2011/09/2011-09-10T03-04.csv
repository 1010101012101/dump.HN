That's why we spent such a long time looking into the alternatives, and we would happily outsource that side of things if we could do so with acceptable losses in flexibility.<p>It's interesting that you don't rate promotions, and I noticed elsewhere in your slides you were fairly negative about ongoing publicity spend. On that we would somewhat agree as well, I think.<p>The difference is more that we're in something of a niche market, nothing like the stereotype HN fodder that is aiming for the general public as a target audience and low prices. We've done a lot of research into both the global demographics of our market and various potential marketing channels, and it turns out that something as simple (to the customer) as a promotion code can support all kinds of other activities beyond just a generic coupon code promotion, as long as you can implement the right systems for generating and recording those codes behind the scenes.<p>This is where we felt the simple options offered by the various billing services today just weren't up to the job, and to some extent I'm not sure they ever could be since beyond a certain point I think these policies are always going to be customised to a particular business model.<p>Anyway, thanks again for sharing the slides. It's useful to know where you were coming from on that particular one because it's the only one where our current approach is clearly different to what you felt had worked for you. Otherwise, your experience is actually quite reassuring, as we had come to many of the same conclusions on your other points and it's nice to know that we aren't completely crazy! :-)",1315625949

The biggest issue with current cross-compilers (GWT, Pyjamas, Haxe etc.) is that they lack good tools to develop and debug. Having support for those natively, theres hardly any reason to target JS directly anymore. And once Chromium has the infrastructure to support more than one language, its possible that the abstractions will be general enough to add support for other languages as well.<p>Our approach is to make an absolutely fantastic VM/Language and development environment and build great apps that fully leverage it in order to help other browsers see the wisdom in following.

People will always come up with new stuff - other pc manufacturers do it all the time.  However, there's not a long term vision of consistency to the other manufacturers, possibly because they are, in fact manufacturers, not end to end designers, developers, manufacturers and retailers.<p>Buying something from Apple, you have a strong case that it'll be supported for at least a few years, the model likely won't go away entirely, and you'll be able to get good support from them via phone, mail or in-store.  Other brands may offer some or all of those aspects, sometime, for some models, but few have a multi-year history of providing all of those consistently.<p>Apple's advantage is the decade of experience they have in building trust with consumers.",1315624813

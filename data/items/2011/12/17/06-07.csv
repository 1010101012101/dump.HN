But I only do it when I have 4-5h I can spend with them to get it done and then I walk away from it.  Really awesome to help friends, especially when wine is involved.<p>My bread and butter business comes through networking at events in my niche and then making continuous updates on social networks so people I've worked with remember I'm out there and pass my name on when people mention business I could do.  I maintain a ""resume site"" with a contact form that facilitates catching those leads.<p>When I meet people who come through the system I ask the source of their referral.  If I know the referral person well, I will take the project 98% of the time.<p>If they say ""I found you on the Internet"" I probably accept only 25-50% of the offers, I take extra long to respond to the quote request to test their patience, and if they even flinch on the topic of money I bail out before we get a contract started.",1324105112
3363667,comment,3363259,3363259,21,0,commieneko,,,"I've had a serious interest in comics/animation for about 45 years. I've had a professional interest for about 30 years.<p>I can't really comment on video game culture, from a personal point of view; obviously there were no video games when I was growing up. And the only video game that ever held my interest, other than for their graphics technology, was <i>Myst</i>; and it hardly had any people in it at all, objectivized or otherwise.<p>(I <i>have</i> been doing some work learning Blender the last few weeks.  And a lot of the tutorials I've been working through have a definite gamer design aesthetic to them. I swear if I have to work through another youtube video about how to create an inappropriately under-clad-for-the-forrest elf girl, or sullen, post-apocalyptic hooker/warrior, I'm gonna barf...)<p>American animation has always been stuck at the grade school, pre-puberty level. So its gender problem is less objectification than it is the whole princess thingie.<p>However, for American comics the primary audience has pretty much always been sexually maturing males.  (Historically, with a few notable exceptions, comics aimed at girls were created by men with little insight into what a female audience might like.) So it's not particularly surprising that the successful comic market caters to power fantasies, rebellion, and sexual objectification. And the fact that comics, again in the U.S., have usually been considered a third rate art form, means there's been no real incentive to conceal or domesticate the raw, naked id on display a lot of the time.<p>Now I actually have no real problem with that.  Geeky teenagers who can't get a date, or have gender empathy issues are people too.  I can relate. And a little misogyny, and misandry, can be fun at times.  (There's nothing particularly uplifting and socially relevant about the Three Stooges either; but I still enjoy the occasional Nyuk and eye poke.) And certainly the over-the-top, operatic story lines would seem to require picaresque, allegorical characters, ripped from the collective psyche.<p>But, <i>damn</i>, a little variety would sure be appreciated.<p>If I accidentally wander into a comic book store these days I'm surrounded by little else but 40-60 year old S&M archetypes, minute variations on characters created years before most of the current audience were even born.  And with a bipolar range of emotions, angry dominatrix to submissive sex kitten, that would make an anime/manga tsundere blush.<p>I lost interest in most American mainstream comics around 1975, mainly through boredom.  Now there has always been higher quality work floating around.  It's there if you look for it.  But Sturgeon's Law applies, with the added characteristic that the 90% case is almost indistinguishable and frozen in time; and at adolescence. Sure the technology is getting better; we've got better reproduction and the distribution system is no longer random mafioso magazine distribution. But the literary style and moral compass is provided by Frank Miller, with art direction by Eric Stanton. It's an insular culture, with little cross fertilization with the rest of society, that keeps telling the same story over and over. Now the base story and its archetypes are not without their merits, but it's certainly not the be-all, end-all of the medium. It just seems that way sometimes.<p>A year or so ago, when the _Scott Pilgrim_ movie out, I really enjoyed it. After seeing it I immediately ran out and bought the graphic novels.  I had almost nothing in common with the characters, the music and video game references were largely lost on me, but it was so nice to have something a little different than the dull thudding of the mainstream American comics Ur-legend. It was light, fluffy, with a novel, to me, storyline.  And it had engaging characters.   I found it very manga-like, both in its visuals and its approach to storytelling.<p>Which brings us to manga.<p>I got re-interested in comics around 10 years ago when the Japanese manga and anime started to become easily available. Now everything bad and/or chauvinistic that you can find in U.S. comics, and by extension, game culture, you can find in spades in the Japanese product; and that's what you usually find imported and bought by the U.S. comics companies and distributors.  However, if you look at the bigger picture, at the market in Japan, there's much more variety and a generally higher level of literary and visual quality than you find anywhere else in the world for visual media.  I'm not really sure why this is. Partly it is because there is much less stigma in their culture directed towards comics; but that doesn't explain the problems with video game culture over here.  Over there not only boys read comics, but girls do too.  And young adults, and even 40 year old salarymen and OL (office ladies).  They have comics aimed at insurance salesmen, golfers, pretty much any kind of genre you can conceive of. The Onion would have a hard time parodying the variety of Japanese manga.<p>Now Sturgeon's Law still applies, but the absolute numbers are so much greater that the absolute numbers of the good 10% is much higher than over here. And the distribution of non-juvenile, male oriented material is much healthier.  The anime and video gaming industries seem to be less so, but they do seem healthier than ours. And don't many of ""our"" more popular games come from Japan?<p>One big difference in Japanese comic culture, in addition to its size, is that it is much more of a participative one.  Non-professional, fan created comics, or Doujinshi, are a major ""craft industry"" over there.  Comiket, the biggest non-professional sales and marketing convention, routinely has half a million attendees, twice a year, with <i>30,000+</i> author circles, or groups, selling their often high quality amateur comics and visual novels. Now admittedly, the ""adult oriented"" Doujinshi get the most press, and a substantial percentage of the audience, but there's a lot of alternatives for those who want it. One of the alternatives is a form of erotic literature, some quite pornographic, and much of it quite good, created by women and aimed at women.  I don't see <i>that</i> kind of thing in large demographic U.S. comics. Other than the Japanese imports, of course<p>Maybe the solution to the U.S. game industry's geek image has to do with smaller scale, more diverse, more specialized gaming creation companies.  With games aimed at demographics who aren't 14 year old males or those who were once 14 year old males and have never had an easily available and well marketed alternative.  I'm not really qualified to speculate intelligently.  That market may well exist and I'm just unaware of it.<p>If it does exist, I may be interested.",1324105087

3363662,comment,3363197,3363437,3,0,runako,,,"> As andrewfelix said, none of the games Zynga makes has the same lasting potential as World of Warcraft or Call of Duty.<p>Financially, this needs to be adjusted for cost of production. I'll go out on a limb and say that a Call of Duty costs vastly more to produce than Words With Friends. It's entirely possible that launching 4 titles annually, where each drops off to 18 million users is a good business. In another genre, id Software was able to make a good business releasing essentially a single title every 2-4 years, targeted at a small subset of male computer nerds. So comparing e.g. WoW to Words with Friends may not be a valid direct comparison.<p>Without making a big judgement about Zynga one way or the other, I can say that the social/Facebook aspect is just about distribution of their games. That's just the channel, which also happens to be a good buzzword for pricing the IPO at the top of the range. Zynga's business is casual games, which has been a good business for quite some time. Remember all the pre-Facebook articules on how casual gaming is letting companies make money by including women in gaming? The Sims was often cited in this genre of coverage. But again, I'd put hard money down that The Sims cost vastly more to produce than Words With Friends.",1324104982

Had a similar situation on a one-project company I started with a friend.<p>In my case I was the developer and I had worked two months past our decision to transfer the company to him, the non-technical founder.  When I asked him (probably somewhat aggressively) to give me a few days off to get started after New Year's day he hired another developer.  He went silent and hid this from me for three weeks until I found out from the client why nothing was a priority any more.<p>Eventually that new developer contacted me to ask about the details of my past business relationship with the guy.  He was having the same problems with him that I had.<p>How do I describe the guy in retrospect?<p>I think he drank a lot and shot his mouth off about being a CEO kickin' back collecting the cheques too much.  I did all the fucking work and he collected.<p>Even though we had been communicating about the issue in my case he took this as a sign to move on.  I'm actually pretty glad he did.  I was ashamed to let the client be stuck with him and all of his failures but sometimes that's the price you have to pay to keep your sanity when things go bad.<p>In the time since this has happened I have done a lot of awesome technical projects and he still has a broken webpage with nothing but errors on the front page.<p>It is hard to find a new developer.  I strongly advise you to get introspective for awhile and figure out what you did to piss him off.

Few people actually break them up, but that's unrelated to what's ""good"".  Advantages: related behavior is encapsulated, likely in separate files, and methods are always available down the pipeline.  Disadvantages: huge numbers of methods at any given time.<p>DCI design: .extend those modules into the models as you need them.  Advantages: related behavior is encapsulated, likely in separate files, and code is declarative about what it intends to be used for and cannot be used otherwise. Disadvantages: have to new.extend(YourModule) every time.<p>If that's the case, I can see the advantage around guaranteeing things aren't using it outside of the controller-declared intended usage.  More controllable / predictable code, basically.  But breaking things into modules is a good idea <i>anyway</i>, regardless of if people actually do so, and aside from the increased control I don't see how this is different than module-including models.<p>Better, I'll admit, but they seem to be claiming ponies and rainbows that'll knock your socks off, when what they're offering is just a style choice (many modules per model) + per-instance mixins rather than per-class, which seems to imply to me that they're allowing a lot more manipulation of the models further down the rendering pipeline than is generally recommended in MVC.",1324103538

3363587,comment,3363259,3363521,5,0,rayiner,,,"> If this interpretation is correct, then media that portrays men as badass and woman as sexy isn't necessarily showing evidence of pandering to males. It may simply be reflecting evolutionary gender roles. It may be that this is one thing males should stop all the self-flagellation over.<p>It's not about self-flagellation or who is pandering to who. The article makes a broader point about how the perception of gender roles affect's our collective judgment about women's' contributions in geek society.<p>Your point about the basis of roles in biology is well taken, but:<p>1) It's not really clear how it's relevant to the larger point of the article. Batman is surely the epitome of sexual desirability in a man (rich, smart, attractive, crime fighter!) but what about the Joker and the Doctor? Skinny guy with disfigured face and pudgy dude with a neck beard? Those portrayals have nothing to do with sexual desirability. The Joker is supposed to convey manic-scary, and the Doctor precise-scary. Meanwhile, all the female portrayals are sexy-something. Sexy-crazy, sexy-eco terrorist, etc. Indeed, the point you make really reinforces the point in the article: we only portray women in terms of their sexual attractiveness, while we're willing to entertain a full range of human traits in men.<p>2) You can't say how much of these perceptions is rooted in culture versus biology. We're genetically predisposed to be skeptical of people not from ""our clan"", and slavery of not-like-kind people has been a feature of human society since antiquity, yet here we are in 2011, with massively different perceptions than even 60 years ago.<p>Perceptions aren't just abstract subjects of self-flagellation. They matter. Heck, geeks should be all too aware of this. As a born loudmouth, I've noticed countless times where people would take my opinion more seriously over someone who was more socially cautious. My girlfriend and I went through a pretty extensive recruiting process in our field in the last year, and you couldn't pay me to switch places with her. She assiduously avoided mentioning me, because it always lead to people trying to figure out if she was a flight risk, while my mentioning her always made me seem more stable. Even if the difference in perception gives women a few % handicap (though I'd postulate, without evidence, it's a heck of a lot more than that, especially in fields like tech or finance), that's a pretty substantial liability when you factor into account the level of competition.",1324102269

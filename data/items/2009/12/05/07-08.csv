All the major search engines make frequent tweaks (sometimes small, sometimes large) to their ranking algorithms, and indexes are updated endlessly around the clock with new and changing content.<p>I don't think there's anything to worry about.",1259999728

I only started on Rails to be able to sell my Swing app better, and only started to get into SQL, Javascript, and all the rest of the rabbit hole as my business (and day job) required me to.  Thats, hmm, about 7 kilo-hours as an upper bound if you assume that all of my day job and business time goes into web programming, which is very, very far from the case.",1259999720

Right now Wave is geared towards adding commentary (which it does well), but that isn't very useful if you don't already have a mostly-complete document to mark up. Even with just one editor Wave can be really obnoxious if you try to write something more than a paragraph in one blurb -- it could really use an Etherpad mode!<p>As someone who's bet on Appjet before, what odds would you give of them pulling that off at Google? By tearing down Etherpad, they've clearly gone all in, but there's a substantial team on multiple continents working on Wave, and they're already set in some rather weird ways that the Appjet guys would have to reform significantly.<p>Do you understand how their users would be at least apprehensive about this? I should have bought a private copy when I had the chance...<p>I do have faith that they'll make a splash on the Wave team, but I doubt that they'll be able to fix Wave so that it's a good Etherpad replacement in the next three months.",1259999598
977888,comment,977664,977664,0,0,dantheman,,,"I found it interesting that the wynn decided that he was on a self destructive path and decided to ban him from their casino:<p>> In 2006, Mr. Watanabe resided primarily at Wynn Resorts' Wynn Las Vegas casino. But, he says, his heavy betting drew the attention of Chief Executive Steve Wynn. After meeting with him in June 2007, Mr. Wynn concluded that he was a compulsive gambler and alcoholic, and barred him from the casino, according to a letter to the Nevada Gaming Control Board drafted by Mr. Watanabe's attorney, Pierce O'Donnell.<p>> Ms. Jones, the Harrah's vice president, says, ""It was not our understanding that he was kicked out of Wynn because of problem gambling.""<p>Whereas at Caesars:<p>>Mr. Kunder and Mr. Deleon say they both voiced concerns to managers that Mr. Watanabe was too intoxicated, and were told not to get involved. ""Nobody wanted to be the one to cut him off,"" Mr. Kunder says. ""We were afraid of what upper management would do if he left because of our actions.""<p>I think that its the moral responsibility for any company to not sell products that harm their customers; they should refuse to do business with those who are throwing their life away.  Now this is not a legal responsibility, but merely doing what is ethical.<p>For instance:\n1. Bar or Package Store that refuses to sell alcohol to alcoholics\n2. McDonalds refuses to sell unhealthy foods to the morbidly obese\n3. Firearm dealer refuses to sell weapons to the suicidal.<p>Also, can credit be extended to an intoxicated person?  Do they have footage of when the credit was extended?",1259999556

977875,comment,977420,977513,0,0,ahlatimer,,,"I think the better question is what does this solve that <i>email</i> doesn't? You can already sort notifications into different inboxes with a decent client. Now, true, you can't have your client take specific actions based on, but that doesn't mean clients can't support it as is. Simply add a feature to a mail client that allows you to enter in certain criteria for titles and take that action. I'm not really sure how this would be any different.<p>I think a better solution is the one a poster made above. Have a single email address for notifications and some web or desktop app that takes care of those. If it's web based with an API or allows plugins, you can build something that plugs into that and do everything that the author is suggesting.<p>I'm just generally against mucking with standards when a solution can already be implemented.",1259998194
977873,comment,977742,977852,0,0,manvsmachine,,,"Being nitpicky for a second:<p>There is a different between something being ""in the cloud"" and ""on a server"", the difference being that if your stuff is just on a remote server, you <i>could</i> go to wherever it is, point to it, and say ""that's where my stuff is"". With cloud apps, your data / service is always available by the same means, but its physical location / method of distribution may have changed an indefinite number of times without you ever noticing. It's just like shared hosting, where your server state is continuously preserved, even though you're not actually hitting the same box.<p>That, said the term ""cloud"" is beaten to death, not because it's inaccurate, but because grid / distributed computing is now the norm rather than the exception when dealing with web apps.",1259997790

Most defendants agree to pay the debt through a payment plan before charges are filed, with around 10% tacked on to fund the D.A. unit. Clark County, which encompasses Las Vegas, prosecutes roughly 200 cases involving gambling debts a month, says Bernie Zadrowski, who runs the bad-checks unit.<p>Unpaid gambling debts seems like it'd be a civil matter to me - pretty crazy that it's criminal, and defendants pay an additional 10% to the state on top of it.",1259997144

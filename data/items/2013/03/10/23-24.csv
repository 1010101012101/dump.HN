5354126,comment,5354038,5354038,2,0,dangrossman,,,"As far as downloading movies, we're at the same place today as we were with music in the middle of the last decade. You can buy a movie from Amazon Instant Video or similar stores and download a file, copy it to any device you want as many times as you want. It's just wrapped in a PlaysForSure DRM wrapper which limits what devices can actually open it. Exactly the same DRM music had before the switch to watermarked MP3s.<p>There's not a lot of pressure to change that because of streaming. Most people are content with streaming the movies they buy instead of downloading. There are nearly no restrictions on streaming. When you buy something from Amazon for example, you can stream it to any number of devices any number of times. You can even stream it to two devices at the same time. The video looks good, you can start watching it immediately, and you don't have to use up 25% of the free space on your tablet to save one movie.<p>People whose primary concern is acquiring a file rather than watching a movie are a niche market. Music in 2005 was a lot different than movies in 2013. A lot more people cared about collecting files, hoarding discographies, and transferring files to portable devices that had no internet connection. It's not the same situation, so that pressure to abandon DRM isn't there now.",1362959321

5354124,comment,5352108,5353972,1,0,dreamfactory,,,"Well the majors used to own distribution. Also manufacturing where they could apply economies of scale, and sales channels where they would operate deals. They also brought an effective monopoly on promotion to the party (street posters, radio, in-store etc). One of the biggest value adds was that they would act as a kind of banker, giving an interest free and unsecured loan to artists to create their first record. (And then there's stuff like putting the whole piece together with producers, designers etc.)<p>The role they played was more like a movie studio (where the artist might be something like a leading actor, as the face of a production). And like movies, the economic model is a classical publishing one where most productions lose a ton of money and the whole enterprise is supported by the runaway successes.<p>The percentages you hear about (e.g. 10-20) are calculated on dealer price and might equate to closer to 30-40% of profit - and are meant to be easier to count this way (per unit sold). There were some shocking deals in the 60's and 70's, many of which were exposed in court, but since then most of the real evil has lain in the complexity of the system and therefore how easy it is to squirrel money away and make highly questionable deductions e.g. record clubs, or more recently spotify (often legitimately, within the bounds of a poorly negotiated contract).<p>I've read Albini and know he worked in the industry.

No.<p>But this approach to innovation has one heck of a\ngood track record for delivering terrific solutions\nfor challenging problems via the US DoD since the\nstart of WWII, and there the batting average is much\nhigher than for information technology venture\ncapital.<p>Moreover, and definitely should not be lost, and for\n70 years has been understood with great clarity by\nboth the US DoD and Congress, the real foundations\nof such innovation are pure and applied research as\nin our top two dozen or so US research universities\n(where about 60% of the annual budget comes from NSF\nand NIH for US national security and health care)\nwith more in Federally Funded Research and\nDevelopment Centers (the FFRDCs) and then more at\nRaytheon, United Technologies, GE, Lockheed-Martin,\nBoeing, General Dynamics, Hughes Electronics, etc.\nIn total, Congress authorizes big bucks for all that\nwork, and Congress 'gets it'.  However, Silicon\nValley wants to laugh at research and then turn and\nrun away afraid of it.<p>US information technology (IT) venture capital has\nhad a 'business model':  Wait for 'traction' to be\nsignificant and growing rapidly but, still, for some\nreason or other, the company still not very\nprofitable, and hope that then the founders will\nneed money for the 'big build out', hiring bizdev\nand marketing people, setting up the sales force in\nthe 'channels', etc. for the 'execution', or be so\neager for ""cash now"" for 'the good life' that they\nwill sign a bad business deal.  Alas, as reported at\nAVC.COM recently, the ROI has been lower than an\nindex fund.<p>Also there is an incongruity:  A small information\ntechnology startup with traction significant and\ngrowing rapidly is in a much better position than\nmillions of US Main Street entrepreneurs who make\nit without an expensive 'build-out' with bizdev,\nmarketing, channel people, business expertise from\nformer management consultants, etc.<p>For venture partners able to evaluate innovation,\ni.e., applied research, just on paper, YC is\nexceptionally good.  Then there's Wegner at Union\nSquare, Morgan at First Round, Metcalf at Polaris,\nBayless at Sevin-Rosen, and a few more.  There are,\nwhat, all together in all of the US, 20?<p>And then there is the list of venture partners who\nprefer to invest in college dropouts.<p>In college, at universities, at several\nlaboratories, at GE, IBM, JHU/APL, and more, I have\nworked with many people good at doing and evaluating\napplied research.  Alas in US venture capital, that\nlist of 20 is about all I can find that is\ncomparable.<p>With the ROI south of the index funds, it looks like\nthere will be some changes that Darwin would\nunderstand.",1362958901

Whether a project will be financially successful is often a matter of pot luck, so many people just sign whatever comes their way and don't review the terms unless a dispute arises and the stakes make it worth winning. For one thing, you can't make people read contract terms carefully and a lot of creative people don't like reading turgid legalese in the first place; for another, the ratio of paying producers to wannabe creatives is low enough that many employment offers may as well be contracts of adhesion, and until people achieve enough success to get an agent the attitude is often that it's better to sign a bad contract than to be passed over for someone more accommodating.<p>Maybe I misunderstood what sort of work for hire situations you had in mind?",1362958811

Examples include Google Wave, the Apple Newton, etc. It also accomodates companies like Apple today, which do succeed in the marketplace and change many people's lives, despite inventing very few things themselves.<p>So when we look at the state of Silicon Valley today we can see that there are companies like Apple and Facebook that are innovative despite not being inventive.

5354012,comment,5352442,5353762,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"Such bombings as you describe have taken place in London, Madrid, and arguably Japan, to cite just a few. They certainly cause a lot of damage, but you can harden fixed infrastructure and to some extent this has already been done, since subway/rail operators already deal with the risk of switching failure and train collision. Train derailments and collisions are themselves powerful events, given the mass and momentum of a fast-moving train, and of course collisions involving freight trains carry additional risks because of chemical spills and so forth. I think it's unlikely that any sort of portable bomb would do the sort of damage you have in mind, because even commuter train carriages are engineered with the possibility of a collision in mind. Although terrorist incidents of this kind have been very destructive where they've occurred, the fact is that the damage is relatively contained, and because it's an elevated risk environment (due to the possibility of accidents) there are robust safety and rescue protocols already in place.<p>As an example of the difference, consider the Oklahoma city truck bomb had explosive force equivalent to 5 kilotons of TNT, involved 13 barrels of explosive, and other materials, requiring a small box truck to transport. It did horrendous damage, but in terms of pure destructive force it wrecked about 1/3 of a 9-story building. The two plane impacts on the WTC, by contrast, caused the total collapse of two 80-story skyscrapers. There was lots of ancillary damage in both cases, but I stand by my arguments that it's harder to predict where an attack from the air will occur and that the destructive potential is typically larger in the case of a successful attack, because of the extra mass, speed, and height inputs.",1362957489

I never had any issues. As far as I know this would be impossible in US.<p>I think that shows how little governments in these regions care about piracy, a logo of PB is well... just that, an image that under normal circumstances doesn't mean anything for officials. In fact I wonder how many even know what it's about.<p>____<p>Note that my experience with piracy in that region isn't really current, but it is my understanding that little changed, or at least I haven't heard anything about it.<p>It's also worth mentioning that the country has bigger issues than fighting piracy, and the amount of government workers/police officers/prosecutors who are educated about those issues is very low.<p>>Also, I can imagine how the state could make the case that the students were actually stealing. I.e. advertisers pay for time on the billboard, and if you take their ads down for any length of time, you've stolen the time they paid for.<p>While you are technically correct I _can't_ imagine state pressing those charges. They usually go for open and shut cases. If they want to charge them they will charge them for something vague-sounding like ""illegal access to billboard/PC"".

The computational capacity for reductionist simulations that will exist probably 20 years from now, and as computational capacity increases those simulations start to become emulations. I don't expect to see massive gains over that time in the other way of doing it.<p>Once you have crude human brain models, a lot of very unethical things will start to happen in the course of further development. (e.g. countless deaths of intelligent beings if you're in the continuity identity boat, and probably a lot of unavoidable pain and suffering regardless of your take on identity). That seems hard to prevent given the enormous advantages that will accrue as a result; there is a strong incentive for people to adopt the pattern identity point of view so as to justify what they are going to do with mind copies in the course of development.<p>The important point is that once you have human brain models, from there the path to many different forms of strong artificial intelligence is just a matter of iterating those models. This seems far more likely to produce results than constructing new forms of intelligence progressively and de novo.",1362956510

Instagram and Facebook make those things <i>nicer</i>, but don't allow us to do anything we weren't doing before.

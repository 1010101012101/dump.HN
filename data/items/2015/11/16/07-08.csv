This is a gross violation of transparency and the principles of a democratic society.<p>The ethical aspect is that I am being spied upon <i>because of what I am not</i> -- because I am <i>not</i> a US citizen. The talk about whether US constitution protects <i>US citizens</i> from dragnet mass surveillance (and thus whether NSA spying is unconstitutional) outright disgusts <i>me</i> (although I do understand the relevance for US citizens, of course). Telling one to &quot;not use US internet services&quot; is like telling one to opt out from the Internet. It&#x27;s a &quot;tough cookies&quot; argument with very limited practical applicability.<p>Collecting information about me to make money out of me by selling me stuff?

When the Julia process is connected over the network, there is obviously a lag between updates. But it&#x27;s no better or worse than an AJAX/WebSocket application. The intention is to use web components to encapsulate UI components and their behavior (including self-contained animations) and Julia to read from them and update their attributes. So one can switch to writing web components and using them in Escher if responsiveness is really a concern. With the programming model in Escher, it will be easy to hoist some computations to the browser once there is Julia to JavaScript compilation.

It&#x27;s directed at Bell, as posthumous snark, since I&#x27;m sure he won&#x27;t feel it.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t ascribe to the school of thought that tells us that simply because superposition works on paper, that such a predictive tool accurately reflects events occurring in reality.<p>It may help us, to understand and <i>deal with</i> curious events, but Bell hasn&#x27;t accomplished anything profound in making his pronouncements.<p>All he did was insist that people shift conceptual placeholders about, to help reorganize a mental model for imagining representations of an idea. To regard his hand-wavy declarations as a crystallized description of reality is nonsense.<p>Ask this: If something cannot be touched, known or inferred, then how can he assert that reality reshapes itself in reverse upon reaching an event, or that an untouchable relationship persists behind the facade or our reality?<p>Furthermore, his arguments are pure semantics. One is not allowed to presume independent unrelated <i>inaccessible</i> slots, one must assume <i>related inaccessible</i> slots. Even though the relationship of the slots is not actually revealed until after it no longer matters whether there was a relationship or not. Oh, and by the way, that relationship transcends reality as we know it, possibly implying a parallel channel of communication, external to our world.<p>Sure, so much better than just stating that there is information missing from our representational model at certain moments in the sequence of events.",1447660282

I&#x27;ve studied those fields when I was at Uni, but never really got the intuition right. I wish I would have read that book back then. The book is short(~200 pages), and focuses on providing both the context and the intuition behind Probabilities. Once you get that right, the formulas just make sense.

10573133,comment,10572688,10572688,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"> Our original lab guidance document released pursuant to that Order asked manufacturers to explain “how [its] device is protected from ‘flashing’ and the installation of third-party firmware such as DD-WRT”. This particular question prompted a fair bit of confusion – were we mandating wholesale blocking of Open Source firmware modifications?<p>> We were not, but we agree that the guidance we provide to manufacturers must be crystal-clear to avoid confusion.<p>Can you feel the wind off of that backpedaling?<p>There&#x27;s no possible way they asked how devices were &quot;protected&quot; from &quot;third-party firmware such as DD-WRT&quot; while not expecting blocking of Open Source firmware modifications.  It sounds a lot more like they got too much backlash: &quot;...no, of course that&#x27;s not what we meant [looks around nervously] you believe us, right?&quot;.<p>While this <i>might</i> result in a desirable outcome, I think it would have come across as far more genuine if they&#x27;d directly acknowledged that they originally suggested blocking all third-party firmware, and subsequently decided that they&#x27;d need a more nuanced approach.  That, at least, would not come across as a (transparently bad) spin attempt.<p>Why does this need any kind of new change in the first place?

If you check out techniques discussed on the How To Learn Any Language forum [1] where many of the foremost polyglots and hyperpolyglots hangout, you&#x27;ll see that Shadowing and L-R are basically accepted as fundamental techniques.<p>It takes real determination to correctly shadow though, like patio11 said you need to reproduce the sample _exactly_. This can cause you to spend an hour trying to perfect <5min of speech. But it&#x27;s extremely rewarding.\nFor example, when I was learning Mandarin I chose a 20 episode (1hr each) tv show as my shadowing material. It took close to half a year of working on it almost every night to finish. But afterwards I had &quot;somehow&quot; developed a deep sense of what words/phrases/idioms/etc _felt right_ to say when speaking and how to say them in that oh-so-close-to-native like way. The topic has been extensively discussed on the learn any language forums. But suffice to say, if you want to improve your spoken ability, doing a lot of shadowing would help.<p>[1] <a href=""http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/forum"" rel=""nofollow"">http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/forum</a>",1447657259

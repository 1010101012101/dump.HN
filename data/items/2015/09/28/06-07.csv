If a doctor fails, then you&#x27;re looking at patients in pain or even dead. Let&#x27;s say you have a conversation with your doctor and your string theorist: which would you prefer to not be wrong? In medicine, it&#x27;s difficult to get a do-over. If your surgery ends up in necrotic tissue in your patient&#x27;s leg, that&#x27;s it, no more leg. If your quantum physics experiment is wrong... try again. Even finding for the null hypothesis is technically a win.<p>Also, as someone who has straddled both physics and biology, I find that these kind of comments that downplay the difficulty and complexity of medicine to be patronising. The human body is <i>ridiculously</i> complex; physics ain&#x27;t the only game in town that needs smart people.",1443420660

While newsletters can support maybe 20 links per week, RSS is adept at handling hundreds if not thousands.<p>Moreover, one of the great benefits of RSS is that it is customizable and one's reading experience pertains specifically and only to them. With newsletters, one is throwing their reading experience to the mercy of the newsletter editor. This is not to say that newsletters aren't valuable. Their spontaneity and conciseness provides a great reading experience. (Although, I think Twitter is superior at this type of thing anyway.)<p>But, given the idiosyncrasies of newsletters, I just don't believe that they are tenable alternatives to RSS.

It seems bought and paid for by special interests, pork barrelling and so forth.<p>As a foreigner I of course have foreign retirement and bank accounts. If they total more than $10,000 (at any point in the last calendar year) you need to report them. This is FBAR (Foreign Bank Account Reporting).<p>Failure to do so can result in civil penalties up to the 300% of the balance and/or criminal prosecution. Why? To fight money laundering, drugs, terrorism or child pornography (every piece of onerous US legislation or prosecution is justified by ostensibly fighting one of more of these things; even sharing MP3s).<p>How are foreign retirement accounts treated? Are they taxable? How do you report them? <i>Nobody really knows</i>. Just tick ""Other"" and write ""Retirement account"" and hope for the best.<p>If your foreign assets are above a certain amount there is another separate form you need to send to the Treasury department IIRC.<p>You can e-file this form... if you use Internet Explorer. The JavaScript actually doesn't work in any other browser in a way that locks your account after 2-3 attempts.<p>In Australia the ATO (Australian Tax Office) produces e-tax, which for most people allows you to file taxes for free. But beyond that, the ATO doesn't seem to have this same level of mistrust of its citizens that the IRS does.<p>In Australia it doesn't scare me to make an honest mistake. In the US it does. This is not only for taxes but things like immigration issues.<p>In some European countries, once a tax return is accepted, that's it, it's done. The government basically can't reopen that later in an audit. In Australia I think they can go back 7 years. No idea what it is in the US. Probably to the day you were born. Now I'm sure there are exceptions to that rule (as in if you commit deliberate fraud) but the point of the system isn't to punish innocent mistakes.<p>All the while corporations and high net-worth individuals get away with blue murder as far as tax obligations go. The US could solve a lot of problems if it treated foreign corporate earnings the same as foreign individual earnings (in that you owe taxes on foreign income even if it isn't repatriated but tax you've paid with double-tax treaty countries offsets that obligation).<p>Yes by all means send me to prison for failing to mention a $24,000 retirement account in Australia I can't touch until I'm 65 instead. Great use of resources.<p>EDIT: to clarify (2), which is the major point relevant to this article, I don't understand why other governments don't seem so easily bought and sold for a pittance (in this case $1.5M over 5 years).<p>Another example: toxic fire retardants used in pretty much all couches due to a California law bought by an industry only worth tens of millions a year [1].<p>In the case of TurboTax specifically, I think so many people use them because of (1) and the complexity of the tax system created by (2).<p>Many people use TurboTax. You can say that's because of lobbying but that's only part of the story.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/magazine/arlene-blums-crusade-against-household-toxins.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/magazine/arlene-blums-crus...</a>",1364323599

5445162,comment,5442290,5444305,2,0,vitalique,,,"I mean just what I wrote: these lists and charts comparing everyone to everything make little to no sense without context. Global standards in the vacuum make no sense. And in the case of global salary charts - well, comparing apples to oranges doesn't even come close. But, as much as I hate generalizations, I'll try to clarify my point. So: usually, above certain, and rather low level, your happiness doesn't scale linearly with the your wealth expressed in money, and the farther you are in the ""rich"" percentile, the more so. This charts tend to imply that wealth should (well, that it has to!) be distributed uniformly, when it isn't, and has never been, and I'm pretty sure will never be.<p>Now, let's suppose you make $15k/yr. (By the way, how's that for your estimate of a European salary? See why I said I hate generalizations?) This site says you're in the top 13% richest people in the world. Immediately, a ton of questions arises: OK, top 13% - what of it? Was it practical to take everyone in the world into consideration? Why and how should this (unverified) information change your feelings about your well-being? Is the current wealth distribution, as represented by the chart, really not OK? Will the knowledge about being in the top 13% help you pay your bills? Should you, now knowing that you are ahead of 87% of population, start to think about redistribution of your wealth and transferring it to those behind you? Should you not be pissed off by those guys higher than you? What if you'd find yourself in the lower 50%? Should you get depressed, or get to work, reaching the 50% mark and then stopping, or what? I could go on and on, but the point I'm trying to make here is that all those questions can be answered in a dozen or so ways, exact number depending on your will to participate in rhetoric battles, and that's why I just can't figure out how this chart can be of any use. There's probably some statistical value in it to me, but almost none practical value. I hope you now see what I was trying to say in the GP comment.<p>Lastly, and moving from the comparison chart itself to the idea that it's used to be backing up  here: I dislike cheap attempts to make people participate in some charity out of induced guilt, and I dislike portraying of being wealthy (whatever that means) as a kind of being unclean with money and obliged to share as a tool of said shame/guilt feeling inducing. I don't think charity should work this way and I think this instills the wrong views of the basic principles of economical and social responsibility in the readers and just exploits the guilt feeling.<p>TL;DR: Do you need money? You should probably stop contemplating 'global salary comparison charts' of questionable real world value, and instead get your statistics straight and start working on your skills/paycheck/whatever keeps you wealthy. Do you want to participate in the charities? Stop getting anxious and building guilt inside you for no reason, get informed (really, get your statistics straight already) and get involved.",1364322683

People routinely pay much higher for car loans, and even now mortgages (which are at historic lows) are only a little better.<p>Because I didn't want the loan. What's not to understand. I wouldn't have had a problem paying the full amount if they had told me sooner. Also it was over 6% because it was 2+ years and not 3.<p>> My guess is that they weren't actually ""estranged"" three years ago, and she probably did meet the definition of a dependent.<p>I'm certain it met the definition but not the spirit. It wasn't worth having us fight or prolong this. As it is it took 8 months, four registered letters, 20+ hours on the phone, and numerous meetings with my tax attorney to get this resolved. IRS didn't just say ""Cannot qualify for Hope Credit because lifetime limit was reached."" They outright denied it and asked for the full amount with interest immediately. If this was a business deduction like restaurant bill, we would've paid it immediately. But denying education credit without any reason why? We had no idea her 4 years credit was already used. We had to contact her school, Sallie Mae, review all of our past records etc. and finally our accountant suggested that maybe when she was younger, someone claimed her.<p>This 2 year $500 'unsecured loan' at a wonderful interest rate cost me easily over $3k and delayed my citizenship process by 8+ months.

Probably there is no easy way out now they're past 1.0.<p>It would be nice to see an extensible range and I've had this thought myself (as have others), there has been some discussion on the list, and they're not sure: <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/golang-nuts/n1izOhyaO8I"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/golang-n...</a><p>but then you can also turn it around and iterate by passing in a function to the structure to iterate:<p><pre><code>    func (self *DataStructure) Iterate(fun IteratorFunc)\n</code></pre>\nRe GOPATH, what do you mean here?<p>Re packages having one level - I actually love this - if you want to nest things in folders, Go is trying to tell you to split it into sub-packages (in that opinionated manner it sometimes adopts). Of course this might feel restrictive, but if a package has lots of files I'd rather it was split up and organised into packages with clear boundaries between them rather than into an interconnected set of files/folders which only makes sense to the author of the code because it's all in one package with no boundaries. This restriction means we will see apps composed of packages by default rather than all in one namespace because it's easier.<p>Re the versioning, they originally resisted versioning the language, but eventually gave up on that idea and used versions, so I suspect for packages they'll eventually recognise the need for this when the ecosystem of packages grows sufficiently. Versions do introduce problems of their own (dependency hell), but IMHO being able to reliably import snapshots of a package (tag, branch or version) will be essential long term without having to fork a repo and rename it just to do so. If go becomes popular you can expect this to be addressed by third parties if the go team doesn't bother.<p>Re the tagging, in a way I'm pleased that they avoid adding lots of features like this, as this is the stort of thing I hate even in the limited version they have (on struct fields) - it's untidy and gets misused and overridden to try to extend the language (see sql libraries in Go tagging fields with all sorts of their own meta-data).<p>Re commas on lists, this bothers me less than having to put semicolon & LF on every line, I think it's a fair trade.<p>Re philosophy, I can't speak for the Go authors, but I've found radical simplicity to be its overriding principle, which explains some of the limitations which annoy you above and the ditching of a lot of OO baggage which languages nowadays are expected to carry whether they want it or not. I've found the simplicity worth the trade for some small frustrations.",1364322142

5445061,comment,5436993,5440585,2,0,jdbernard,,,"> I'm sure you can come up with several pretty ways of breaking up every specific situation that is both aesthetically pleasing and functional (in fact I already use your first example, with slight modifications), but there is no general way that can be encoded in rulebook or indent rules of an IDE.<p>Sure, but there are always edge cases not covered by the rule book or IDE. For me the rulebook should say ""break lines so that no single line is > 80 chars"" and leave it to the programmer to do so in an intelligent way for each scenario. Or if you want a little more conformity add some guidelines like: keep a method call on one line if possible, keep each method parameter on one line if possible, when breaking a method call over several lines vertically align each parameter (indenting when a parameter consists of a long method call itself), etc. You can cover the majority of cases. Examples are helpful.<p>This:<p><pre><code>    return calculateFirstPart(commonObject, dataObject) + \n           calculateSecondPart(commonObject, aDifferentDataObject);\n</code></pre>\ninstead of this:<p><pre><code>    return calculateFirstPart(commonObject, dataObject) + calculateSecondPart(\n        commonObject, aDifferentDataObject);\n</code></pre>\nThis:<p><pre><code>    computerExplainToMe(\n        ""Why are all my identifier names are so long?"",\n        currentKnowledgeEngine.selectedExplanationType,\n        KnowledgeContext.getContextForEngine(\n            currentKnowledgeEngine, Language.English),\n        ""Why is this parameter here. I don't even know what it does"")\n    </code></pre>\ninstead of this:<p><pre><code>    computerExplainToMe(""Why are all my identifier names are so long?"",\n        currentKnowledgeEngine.selectedExplanationType, KnowledgeContext.\n        getContextForEngine(currentKnowledgeEngine, Language.English), ""Why "" +\n        ""is this parameter here. I don't even know what it does"")\n</code></pre>\nThe thing about long lines of code is that they almost always contain multiple ideas compressed into one (variable assignment, retrieval, lookups, conditionals, etc). In most programming languages we could put the whole program on one line if we really wanted to. When I see a line that is > 80 characters it makes me think I should be breaking that line up into multiple statements anyways, but depending on the language we may be saving ourselves some boilerplate or sometimes actual resources by putting it all in one line. So intelligent linebreaks are a good compromise in my opinion. We can still separate the individual expressions into readable chunks, but keep the whole expression more tightly packaged (physically and mentally) than it would be if we broke it out into multiple statements.<p>Just for fun, here is maybe a better way to write that second one:<p><pre><code>    cookies = responseObject.headers.\n        findAll { header -> header.key == ""Set-Cookie"" }.\n        collect { cookieHeader -> new Cookie(cookieHeader) }</code></pre>",1364321627

At the end of the day the design is straight forward, but its hard to wrap your head around since you can't easily just look at the code and go ""ah ok FixedUpdate gets called right after WhateverFunction, now this makes sense"".

Why do you ask?  Did he/they cause the manual penalty against my site and then cause the manual penalty to be removed?  How?<p><i>You're affected by a couple algorithms in our general web ranking.   The first is our page layout algorithm.  See <snip>.  In particular, comparing a page like <a href=""http://onlineslangdictionary.com/meaning-definition-of/compy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlineslangdictionary.com/meaning-definition-of/compy</a> to a page like <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Pepperazzi&defid=6571433"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Pepperazzi&#3...</a>, your site has much more prominent ads above the fold compared to Urban Dictionary.</i><p>Interesting!  I had read that post on the Webmaster Central Blog before, but never even considered that the layout algorithm was penalizing my site, for a few reasons.  1. The upper leaderboard ad + side wide skyscraper ad combination is so commonly used everywhere on the web.  2. I removed the leaderboard ad from the entire site from 11 May 2011 through 31 August 2011 and found it had no effect on the site's ranking.  (It also had no effect on user behavior, such as bounce rate or time-on-site.)  3. My site isn't one of the sites ""that go much further to load the top of the page with ads to an excessive degree or that make it hard to find the actual original content on the page.""<p>I have removed all advertising from onlineslangdictionary.com, and also removed the yellow box at the top informing visitors why they no longer have access to the citations of slang use.  (Better safe than sorry, I guess.)  The page layout penalty should no longer be a problem.<p>(Since ads are no longer on my site, for reference, here are screenshots of those two URLs you linked, one from my site and one from urbandictionary.com:<p><pre><code>    OSD: http://onlineslangdictionary.com/static/images/layout-algorithm/2013-03-24-osd.com-atf-def-of-compy.png\n    UD: http://onlineslangdictionary.com/static/images/layout-algorithm/2013-03-24-ud.com-atf-def-of-pepperazzi.png\n</code></pre>\nInterestingly, with my screen size, Urban Dictionary has <i>more</i> pixels above the fold dedicated to ads.)<p><i>Your site is also affected by our Panda algorithm.  Here's a blog post we wrote to give guidance to sites that are affected by Panda: <a href=""http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/05/more-guidance-on-building-high-quality.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/05/more-guid...</a> </i><p>I've read that article in the past, and gave it a re-read.  I understand Panda is about penalizing low-quality sites.<p>High-quality dictionaries have citations of use from published sources.  Citations prove the definitions are correct, provide real-world illustrations of proper usage, are just plain interesting, etc.  Penalizing a dictionary for showing citations is like penalizing Wikipedia for having lots of numbered sentence fragments at the bottom of their articles.  That's how they prove that their claims are factual.<p>onlineslangdictionary.com had around 5,000 citations of slang use, collected and added by hand.  The presence/absence of citations on the site is the only thing I've found to correlate with the presence/absence of a penalty (<a href=""http://onlineslangdictionary.com/static/images/panda/overview-charts.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlineslangdictionary.com/static/images/panda/overvie...</a>).<p>Due to Panda, they were removed for non-authenticated users (including Googlebot) most recently starting 16 November 2012.  They have been unavailable to authenticated users starting 8 March 2013.  Because of a coding mistake on my part, they were visible for between 3 and 4 hours on 12 March 2013.  (Basically: I accidentally inverted the logic of the 'if' statement that checks whether citations need to be removed (the answer <i>should</i> always be ""yes"") causing the code to <i>not</i> remove citations.)  I fixed the bug as soon as I noticed it, and filed an updated reconsideration request.<p>The citations are gone.  All content on the site is 100% original.  It's got the only real, free slang thesaurus on the web.  There are other unique features.  I don't know what Panda would be penalizing the site for.<p>I started The Online Slang Dictionary in 1996, and have been working on it full-time for the past 6 years.  My goal is to create the ""Wiktionary of Slang"" - not a flash-in-the-pan made-for-AdSense site.  I was delighted with the site's ranking Between The Penalties: from 8 days after I <i>first</i> removed the citations until 3 days after I put them back on the site (13 November 2011 until 9 October 2012.)<p>It would be awesome to have the chance to once again compete on a level playing field with other slang websites.  I'd love to have the time to implement the new features I've been dying to add, rather than spending time (over a year now) trying to guess why Google is penalizing the site and fixing those guesses - since my data shows that site growth is impossible with the penalties in place.",1364320970

Most of the great players are said to lift in important situations such as service break opportunities or tie breaks. Perhaps if you have such amazing stamina that you can go flat out all the time then this might be the best strategy. But for most mortals (including many greats) prioritising is an important skill that should be used.",1233899973

But this analogy breaks down I would argue even within tennis, but certainly amongst other games and absolutely in life.<p>Tennis is a game of endurance: if the score is 30-love and you can expend a disproportionate amount of energy to get it to 40-love or hold back, store that energy, and let it go 40-15, you should if you'll need that energy later. On the other hand, if it's 40-love and you can clinch the game, there's a far higher payoff for that effort.<p>Similarly in football, if there's 48 seconds left in the game, 4th down and 1 yard on the 20 yard line and you're behind with a score of 13 to 14, you better be ""playing the score"" and kick a field goal, not go for a touchdown pass.<p>Strategic concessions and strategic fights are the true key to success.

You really don't want to be a true innovator: who uses an Altair, or WWW (the browser, not the web), or AltaVista, or CP/M, or Visicalc, or Betamax, or a Xerox Alto, or Xanadu?  But if you put enough innovations together, you get something really kickass like GMail.  Going after established markets is just prudent business sense, it doesn't mean they aren't innovating.<p>(And there are some pretty crazy off-the-wall experiments that go on inside Google to, it's just that nobody can talk to you about the ones that haven't launched, and it's a good bet that 99.99% of the crazy stuff never will launch because it's basically useless.)",1233898758

469397,comment,469147,469395,0,0,andreyf,,,"Basically,<p><pre><code>  foo.barMethod(""Hello"", ""World"")\n</code></pre>\nis identical to:<p><pre><code>  someFunction.call(foo, ""Hello"", ""World"");\n</code></pre>\n(assuming that foo.barMethod === someFunction)<p>This is a little weirder than it seems, because of a variable called `this'. You see, `this' is set inside of a function whenever you call it, based on how you've called it. It can be set a couple of ways:<p><pre><code>  foo(arg1, arg2, ...); // sets `this' to the global object (in a browser, that's `window')\n  foo.call(o, arg1, arg2, ...); // sets `this' to `o'\n  foo.apply(o, [arg1, arg2, ...]); // sets `this' to `o' (same as `call')\n</code></pre>\nNone of these are the way you usually set `this' on function invocation, however. Usually, `this' is set automatically when you invoke a function which happens to be a property of an object. So, for example:<p><pre><code>  bar = { foo: function (x,y) { var thatThing = this; ... } };\n  bar.foo(1,2) - sets `this' (and `thatThing') to 'bar'.\n</code></pre>\nHowever (!!!), if you say:<p><pre><code>  foo2 = bar.foo;\n  foo2();\n</code></pre>\nThe `this' inside of your function, as well as `thatThing', will both be set to `window'.<p>details here: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Referen...</a>",1233897397

This one, to this day, I cannot explain.<p>The gist of it is:  I do ""document.attachEvent(""onmousemove"", fn)"" where fn resizes a div based on where the cursor is.  I then test it out, and it's slow as hell, especially when the div gets pretty big.  In fact, the event only seems to fire when I move the mouse slowly.<p>Now here's the catch.  I bind the event <i>again</i> so that the  function is bound <i>twice</i> to onmousemove, and performance is vastly improved!<p>How could it be that binding a function twice to an event speeds it up?  Three times has no further effect... beyond that I haven't tested.<p>EDIT:  Go to my profile to see the bug in action.  While resizing a div (which contains 2 iframes), it's much much smoother with the ""mousemove"" event attached twice.",1233897109

It's possible to beat Apple; it's <i>not</i> possible to beat them at their own game. Microsoft is constantly playing feature catch-up, and they can't win; Apple has thoroughly dominated at the things they do, and anything Microsoft does to catch up will <i>only</i> be catch-up. They could design a minimalist theme and it's catch-up. They could slim down their applications and release a software suite and it's catch-up. So either they make a new desktop metaphor and begin developing an alternate system, or they pray that Apple makes a major mistake, which is risky, because Apple is pretty cautious.<p>Stuff like 360 and Live Search are hard to integrate together. They're so different! Microsoft would be hard-pressed to unify the two. And that's the problem. Apple has this obsessive integration: you get OS X on the iPhone, you have the same volume buttons on that and the computer, you get visual designs gradually blending through, the featuresets are all called the same things... it's all tight. Microsoft doesn't control that stuff. Apple has the rare ability to be uncompromising in design and get away with it.<p>With the features they have now, I think Microsoft's best idea is to strip down. Avoid fancy things, deal with the really important thing. We have these great games, we have this evolution-not-revolution interface, each time we make something it's a little bit better. They're the dominant player, so their best bet is playing it safe and trying to outlast Apple. It's still hard, but they've got an excellent team.

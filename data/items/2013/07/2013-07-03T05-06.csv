5982725,comment,5981922,5981922,1,0,prewett,,,"I haven&#x27;t had anger, but I did have to work through non-clinical depression and the process might be helpful to you.  Please note, I can only speak from a Christian perspective.  The behavior (anger, etc.) is the fruit of something deeper, so you need to figure out what that is.  My counselor had me write letters to God:  describe how you are feeling (he gave me a list of words, see [1]) and why and then commit yourself to his care.  I found that the goal of this is to figure out why you are feeling the way you are:  the anger is coming from somewhere.  The problem is not the anger, but what is causing the anger.  If you have been abused, that likely factors into it, but injustice (real or perceived), frustration, unmet needs, etc. might also be reasons. Once you identify the reasons, then you need to deal with them.  (See [2])  For example, forgiving people who have wronged you.<p>I strongly recommend seeing someone professional;  we need doctors for the soul as much as for the body.  I would recommend finding a good Christian counselor, because I don&#x27;t think that we can truly resolve our issues without the healing that only God can provide.  If you are near Austin I can recommend one.  However, definitely find someone (secular or not), a counselor or a psychologist who can help walk you through this.<p>Also, you said you have no one to talk to in real life.  I would recommend taking some risks to be vulnerable with the friends you have, or intentionally start looking for the kind of friends that you can be vulnerable with.  We weren&#x27;t created to be alone.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~prewett/archive/FeelingWords.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~prewett/archive/FeelingWo...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.joycemeyer.org/articles/ea.aspx?article=dealing_with_anger_gods_way"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joycemeyer.org/articles/ea.aspx?article=dealing_w...</a>",1372830699

The author demonstrates a lack of economic savvy by writing, &quot;As can be seen from table 1 the economics of pair programming are severely negative.&quot; That table uses lines of code (LOC) as the key metric. There are so many problems with the choice of such a wrongheaded metric. First, writing better software often involves writing less code! Second, as a commenter points out, knowledge transfer is very important. Third, pair programming may build team cohesion.<p>Many industries use variations of pair programming, as the author recognizes. That said, I think the author fumbles in suggesting that quarterbacks trading time is similar to pairing. I wonder why the author didn&#x27;t look at apprenticeships in manufacturing, where skills are demonstrated in a hands-on way.<p>Finally, as a model-builder myself, it pains me to see weak, flawed models baked into papers such as this. Take this section of text: &quot;Table 1 is extracted from a pair-programming calculator developed by the author.  It allows researchers to input a number of variables including staff compensation, application size in lines of code, and coding speeds for both pairs and individual programmers.&quot;<p>Such language, to me, makes it appear that the author is trying to make his claims seem &quot;mechanical&quot; -- just the matter of turning a crank and running some calculations. Such a claim is silly and a sham, of course. The choice of what to measure and how to weigh it is central. This paper makes no serious attempt to promote such a discussion.<p>In summary, this paper did not make a serious attempt to understand the true (economic, yes!) value of pair programming, in my opinion. If I were to guess, the author may well have had his conclusion in mind before writing the paper or doing his research.",1372830431

But I believe people mostly use the term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; to reinforce the assumptions of their own worldview. The comment to which I replied seems like a good example of that, since it didn&#x27;t react to anything specific about this case (disavowed any knowledge of it, in fact), only the form that it took.<p>One piece of evidence for this security-blanket interpretation of &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; is that we&#x27;re much more likely to invoke the term about things that happen close to home, and much less likely to resort to it about things that happen abroad. Also, the ridiculing language that invariably accompanies the term is a social ritual. It has no content; its function is to enforce consensus belief. The human need for consensus belief is profound and we&#x27;re largely unconscious of its influence on us, which makes it that much stronger.<p>I think this phenomenon is fascinating and I wish it were possible to study it at a more-than-anecdotal level, but I don&#x27;t know of anything like that.<p>p.s.

I live in Houston, which is a reasonable drive from the eastern district of Texas.  If I got sued, I&#x27;d probably show up in court just to make them show up in court.<p>2. I wonder if a layered defense would work?  &quot;Every problem in computer science can be solved by yet another level of indirection.&quot;  I&#x27;ve read about holding company structures where Company A holds the trademarks, code, IP, etc. for a business and then licenses it for use by Company B.  Company B is a shell that passes back everything to Company A.  The only one doing business potentially &quot;making, using or selling&quot; the potentially patented IP is Company B, which can string the troll along, then close up business overnight and reappear as Company C, with new licensing agreements from Company A.  Probably doesn&#x27;t work long term, but it sure would slow them down.<p>3. What about &quot;patent troll delayers&quot; as a service?  These would be people who live near the court that are given, say, 0.01% of the company.  As &quot;owners&quot; of the company, they may appear in court pro se, without hiring a lawyer.  I think there are requirements to be in the patent bar before appearing in patent trials, so pro se is not an option, but just showing up, acting pissed off, and demanding your rights might gum up enough of the court&#x27;s docket to be some major friction in the troll&#x27;s process.  We aren&#x27;t talking about million dollar judgements here, just enough friction to cost more than the settlement amount they were looking for.  Imagine if the federal judge had to take time to throw out pro se defendants in hundreds of cases.  There goes the court&#x27;s schedule, and it would make great television.",1372828258

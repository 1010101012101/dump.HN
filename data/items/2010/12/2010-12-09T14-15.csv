1987640,comment,1987532,1987532,0,0,mgkimsal,,,"It's certainly cost this person a lot more than $418, because most of this seemed to be earned with credit card reward points.  Spend $4k in 6 months and get 75,000 points, etc.  So.. great.  Spend a lot of money (possibly buying more than you intended to) and get a reward.<p>I guess being on the other side of the table - a merchant - I resent the whole 'rewards' racket.  A) I end up getting charged more as a merchant, and I can't <i>not</i> accept your card.  B) It's encouraged a culture of chasing after rewards that often aren't really something you need or end up being hard to use for most people (airline miles).<p>Yes, there are a few people who can really 'make out' (like this guy) but in the end this is mostly just another way for banks to make extra profits off people's greed ('something for nothing').<p>""If I were to pay for this adventure with cash and book individual flights, it would cost almost $6,000""<p>I'm guessing there was a lot more than $6k spent on 'stuff' to get this.",1291906754

After more than a very few selections, the arm begins to feel sore, cramped, and oversized — the operator looks like a gorilla while using the touch screen and feels like one afterwards.

1987497,comment,1986905,1986905,0,0,jrockway,,,"Three is a good number.<p>C needs to be one of them, because everyone writes their libraries in C, and you need to use them and be able to contribute your own libraries.  Don't use C for applications, though; there is no performance gain (gluing C libraries together in C is as fast in $foo as it is in C for most values of $foo), and there is a maintainability and expressiveness loss.  Libraries are simple enough and small enough in scope that this doesn't matter.  Your HR org-chart editor web app?  Not so much.<p>So I use C for libraries that other people need to use, but nothing else.  This way, I get code reuse without having to force a ""policy decision"".  Everyone is fine with C and it integrates well with pretty much every other programming language.<p>After C, you need a language for high-performance but moderately complex applications.  This language needs to allow for expressive description of high-level tasks, but it also needs to expose primitives for writing ""fast"" code.  A lot of people choose C++ for this, but I think C++ is a bit too low-level for application development.  Most people choose Java or C#.  (I hate both, but it's close to the right thing.)  I use Haskell; other good options are OCaml, F#, Common Lisp, etc.<p>I use this class of languages for things like ETL or network-based computation services.  The code is a little complex, and it needs to run fast.  This family is perfect for that.<p>The third language you need to know is a ""scripting language"".  This is a loaded term, because scripting sounds like it's not real programming.  But this is wrong, making a Perl script to filter your email is just as ""real programming"" as writing the TCP stack for your OS.  If you have a problem you want to solve and you type some stuff into a computer so that it learns how to solve the problem, that's programming.<p>I use Perl, but obviously there are a lot of options here; Perl, Python, and Ruby are the best choices, followed by Lua, various Scheme implementations, and so on.  I picked Perl over Python and Ruby because they all really suck performance-wise, but at least Perl has a great community and a great library repository.  It doesn't really matter which you choose, as long as you love it.  (My favorite color is green.  Yours may not be.  Let's not argue about it, though.)<p>This class of languages, in general, is best for building complex applications where maintainability is the core requirement.  Scripting languages give you the tools to design and build incredibly flexible abstractions that let you hide a lot of complexity where appropriate.  They also make it really easy to write great tests, and to implement new ideas.  Being unafraid to refactor your code and being able to design abstractions to refactor into are the keys to maintainability.  And languages like Perl make that really easy.<p>Lately I've been playing with node.js, which I really like for ""quick scripts"" that need to be event-driven and need to talk to the network.  I'm hesitant to include it in this category, though, because it lacks good namespace support, which makes writing complex apps tough.  It also doesn't have a mature toolchain yet.  But it is cool and if you have done web programming but haven't done any ""scripting"", you can get started and start having fun quickly.  So do check it out.<p>(Also worth noting; I've written event-based network services in all three classes of languages.  The performance is the same regardless of which you choose!  Nothing is slow for IO; the plumbing is all handled in some generic C library and the OS.  C is fast, Haskell is fast, Perl is fast, and node is fast.)<p>Finally, if you do web stuff, you need a fourth language that compiles to Javascript, just because that's how the web works.  I think plain Javascript is fine, so I use that, but coffeescript and friends are also cool.",1291904563

As well, for the record, before you jump to conclusions with charged and disingenuous position slanting words like ""lie"" It just so happens that that single  purchase was going to be used to teach my daughter video production. I took it as an opportunity to feel the vendor out pre-purchase.<p>As for failing to see that lack of pricing structure is indicative of immaturity in a sales organization I can only assume that that lack of sight comes from the fact that you either have little experience with enterprise and OEM purchasing or have never been in charge of contract negotiations, a inflexible vendor can be soul sucking. Negotiation is a big part of volume purchasing and flexibility in pricing structures is mandatory when dealing with such if there is any hope of creating a long term and mutually beneficial arrangement.<p>To spell it out, a organization that treated a one off request for a discount due to non-conventional circumstances is a company that shows attention to detail, and a willingness to work with even the smallest purchaser to make them happy. If I told him hey I have 75K would he have responded differently? sure he would have, but where is his breaking point when will he decide that it is not worth supporting me due to the money being in the rear-view. Conversely a guy that supports even the smallest customer is going to treat a volume purchaser very well. Judging by this particular vendors response, I saved myself years of headaches by making a small simple request and I am glad I did.<p>It is even more important when you deal with a small development house, I cannot tell you how many times I have seen large companies held hostage by a small vendor due to lack of maturity in their sales and customer support process. Ensuring that a potential vendor is not one of those shops is imperative to the happiness of my client and is therefore good business on my end. Vendors are free to have as crappy of sales and support organizations as they see fit, but when it comes to my organization I bend over backwards to make my clients happy and I chose vendors that align with that core philosophy.<p>This particular vendor was within his right to not give me a discount, I hold nothing against him and I don't hold him account for it but I am also within my right to see that as a sign of lack of maturity in his organization and take my purchasing elsewhere. The purchase reflects on the solution that I was providing for my client, and my ability to support the solution is only as strong as the weakest vendors support. I'm not betting my companies reputation on a vendor that can't even put together non-commercial or educational licensing packages much less an OEM arrangement.",1291904288

1987418,comment,1986675,1987214,0,0,Hermel,,,"Wuala dev here. I just wanted to let you know that we have fixed some of the issues you have mentioned. We'll switch to CBFS as file system driver shortly (that's the same driver SugerSync is using AFAIK). However, this is still a kernel driver. Unfortunately, Windows provides no other way to mount a custom file system. DropBox just syncs an existing folder, but that does not scale to large amounts of data. For example, if you have 100 GB of data online, you cannot sync it to your notebook with a 60GB disk. On the other hand, the dropbox approach is simpler. Delta-uploads (achieved with block-level-deduplication) are planned for spring. You can also disable seeing the public groups in the options now. Also, the UI (which is SWT and not Swing btw) got more light-weight and simpler with the August update. We are not as fast with many things as we'd like to be, but there certainly is progress.",1291903316

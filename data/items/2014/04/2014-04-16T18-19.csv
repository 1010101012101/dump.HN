Lending is just one of them.<p>Providing a variety of services well as an integrated business is very, very difficult for banks today. That has created opportunity for smaller companies and upstarts to succeed by unbundling services that have historically been accessed through traditional banks[1].<p>For some reason that isn&#x27;t clear to me, the OP seems to have fallen in love with the idea of the traditional integrated bank even though the market is clearly suggesting that this isn&#x27;t where the opportunity and action is.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.aweissman.com/2013/01/banking-and-unbundling.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.aweissman.com/2013/01/banking-and-unbundling.htm...</a>",1397674754

7599772,comment,7599475,7599475,66,0,famousactress,,,"I will say that where I work we appear to have managed to get on a list of &quot;startups to send your resume to&quot; by one or two of these bootcamp shops, and the resumes tend to be severely underwhelming. Here are some of the things that have been negatively affecting my reaction to them (I share in hopes this is useful, not to bash bootcamps or folks that attend them!):<p>ONLY A GITHUB PROFILE<p>It seems pretty clear that the bootcamps told you we <i>really</i> care about your github profile, and that sometimes gets interpreted as &quot;to the exclusion of everything else&quot;.<p>APPARENTLY BORN SIX MONTHS AGO<p>Related to the over-emphasis on github profiles is the exclusion of anything not-code related. I get that code bootcamps attract lots of folks who maybe got a political science degree or spent the last three years in real estate. Tell me that. I&#x27;d love to see what you&#x27;ve been up to, we&#x27;re looking to hire <i>you</i>, not your ability to code. I hope these institutions aren&#x27;t making folks feel like their past isn&#x27;t valuable because it didn&#x27;t involve Rails.<p>ALSO THE GITHUB PROFILE IS BORING<p>The profiles tend to have some code camp rails homework in them. It&#x27;s hard to go from learning to code to having a github profile that&#x27;s impressive in a short period of time (Hell, I&#x27;ve been working for well over a decade and my github profile isn&#x27;t impressive!).. That said, if you <i>do</i> want me to care about your github profile I&#x27;d rather see signs of enthusiasm in the form of personal gists or projects or thoughtful bug reports or feature tickets on other projects.<p>DISGUISES THE CODE BOOTCAMP AFFILIATION<p>Seems like the elephant in the room on these things is where you&#x27;ve been learning to code and how you found us. Many of the resumes seem to avoid being transparent about this. I wanna know which bootcamp you did, what got you interested, and how it went.<p>THEY TOLD YOU TO EMAIL US<p>It&#x27;s clear that we&#x27;re on a list and plenty of candidates email us without knowing (or maybe caring) about what we do. That&#x27;s a non-starter. Frankly, I doubt that the people who even put us on the list of shops to mail looked any closer than a crunch-base profile or Who&#x27;s Hiring post on HN.<p>RAILS<p>The resumes I&#x27;m seeing clearly come from a bootcamp that emphasizes Rails and JS/HTML. That&#x27;s great, but we&#x27;re not a rails shop and the candidate is brand spanking new to this. It&#x27;s probably better that you continue your investment in Rails before doing a wholesale dive into another platform.<p>At any rate, I love that camps like this exist. I&#x27;ve long thought our industry needs really good trade education to supplement CS programs which are focused and affordable ways to launch folks who are interested into software development. I just think the packaging and presentation of folks coming out of these things could use some work.",1397674739

If I take the photo at f/18 then use an app like the one linked, producing extremely similar results, that&#x27;s banned.

So technically speaking eiffel still relies on C... Note that its not very optimized C either, its much slower than Java for most of the stuff I tried (with contracts disabled).<p>Said compiler also happens to be terribly buggy and unreliable: The author still teaches the CS &quot;Introduction to programming&quot; class at my university with this language and every year students struggle with the language and the obscure IDE. Also don&#x27;t know anybody that ever wrote a line of Eiffel again after that class even though the idea with contracts is kind of interesting.<p>Summa summarum: Best language constructs don&#x27;t help if your basic tools are broken and make it a pain to write in that language.",1397674709

If it&#x27;s a headline feature, it&#x27;s not a beta. It should work correctly (ignoring 3rd party apps having to update to integrate).<p>This applies to Apple as well. When they first announced Siri, they called it beta but it was the headline feature in <i>all their ads</i>.<p>If you add a weird little feature, I&#x27;m OK with the beta label.

Some with high enough karma will downvote these sorts of comments when they come across them. To avoid those downvotes, but still post something, minimally add a sentence or two explaining why you&#x27;re in agreement. For example:<p>This. With Ada, for instance, there&#x27;s SPARK which is a restricted version of Ada with additional constructs (in Ada comments) for formally verifying the program. Spark, then, has grown to the point where it&#x27;s almost its own language (though Ada compilers can handle it because of how the annotations are placed in comments).",1397674595

You can simulate it in Photoshop, but generally it takes a lot of work and the results aren&#x27;t great.  The &quot;shallow depth of field&quot; effect was one of the primary reasons why I bought a DSLR.  (Yeah, yeah, yeah, quality of the lens and sensor are important too.)  Being able to achieve a passable blur effect, even if it&#x27;s imperfect, on a cellphone camera is really pretty awesome, considering the convenience factor.  And if you wanted to be able to change the focus after you take the picture, you had to get a Lytro light field camera -- again, as expensive as a DSLR, but with a more limited feature set.<p>Regarding Google&#x27;s specific implementation ...<p>I&#x27;ve got a Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom, which hasn&#x27;t yet gotten the Android 4.4 update, so I can&#x27;t use the app itself to evaluate the Lens Blur feature, but based on the examples in the blog post, it&#x27;s pretty good.

The S4 Zoom is a really terrific point-and-shoot that happens to have a phone, so I&#x27;m excited to try it out.

I do agree that it&#x27;s probably impractical, but I found the approach fun to think about.<p>I also think this has a few advantages over tilt-up:<p>1) The resulting product is lighter, since the walls are mostly air rather than concrete. I suspect they could manufacture small houses at a factory and transport them by truck, without the construction overhead of other prefabricated home systems.<p>2) The end product probably insulates better. With the right internal design to try to limit air movement (and thus natural convective losses), these walls look like they could have a decent R-value.<p>3) Less space is required to print in-place or construct a manufacturing facility. Tilt-up requires enough space to pour the wall forms around the building in addition to room to utilize cranes and cherry pickers - an in-place gantry system for printing a house should only take (house+gantry) footprint rather than (house + height of house).",1397673850

When our mobile client starts up, it does a DNS lookup, fetches the entire list of servers, and then picks one to connect to. If that connection fails, it tries another one, etc. until it runs out (which has never happened).<p>We also ship the client with a pre-populated list of IP addresses (the current server list as of build time) and the client caches the list it gets from DNS whenever it does a lookup. This means that even in the event of a complete DNS failure, even for hours at a time, our clients are still able to connect. This was quite handy when GoDaddy&#x27;s DNS was inaccessible a year or two ago due to what I recall was a DDoS attack.<p>A few weeks ago my ISP&#x27;s DNS servers went down, and since I have the same mobile and DSL provider, I was completely unable to do anything on the internet — except play our game. It was then that I wondered &#x27;why don&#x27;t more apps do this?&#x27; It seems like a simple problem; if you can&#x27;t do a DNS lookup, assume the previous IP is still valid. Assuming you&#x27;re using HTTPS, there should be no more exposure from a security perspective unless someone takes control of your IP address <i>and</i> fakes your SSL certificate, at which point you&#x27;re screwed anyway.",1397673812

You want feature X (the ability to return multiple values) without having to either (a) pick apart a simple structure containing those values or (b) assign names to those values, letting the runtime system pick them apart (or never stick them together, its choice) for you.\nSo what more do you want?!<p>You want an option type, right? Well what&#x27;s an option type? Let&#x27;s consider Haskell:<p>data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a<p>No matter what kind of cleverness you do in memory or whatever, in the end this type is a tuple of two values: (constructor, data). The only special thing going on is that the type system makes sure that (a) constructor == Maybe or constructor == Just, and (b) if constructor == Maybe the data field is meaningless (has no type, can&#x27;t be read, does not effect equality, whatever).<p>But it&#x27;s still a tuple. The cons cell is the <i>exact same thing</i> in the absence of a strict compile-time type system, except for your code example we have it flipped: (data, constructor) (well, actually you seem to have a flipped &#x27;Either String a&#x27; going on there, but let&#x27;s stick with option for now) where data is actual data or nil when meaningless, and constructor is like Just when nil and like Nothing when true (btw, lisp convention is the other way around; second value is true like Just and false/nil like Nothing).<p>Just like the original linked article, what your complaint boils down to is &quot;non-compile-time-typed systems allow you to do things which would break compile-time-typed systems&quot;—and while I love compile-time typing as much as the next Haskell aficionado, I don&#x27;t demand compile-time typing in a language [family] whose very essence is its absence.<p>EDIT: if you could reply and explain what <i>would</i> resolve this &quot;shortcoming of the language&quot;, maybe I could understand better what you&#x27;re trying to say...",1397672927

If you are modifying an unbraced if-statement and aren&#x27;t paying attention to scoping, then you are being woefully negligent at your job. Especially when you are working on cryptographic code used by millions of people to protect their most valuable information.<p>So let&#x27;s say we force more red tape to make sure this doesn&#x27;t happen. Those of us who pay attention to scoping probably won&#x27;t mind too much, it&#x27;s good practice to do this anyway.<p>But what about the mediocre programmer? He may decide that now his if/else if/else three-liner, when adding new lines for {}, should really just turn into a switch/case. And now he neglects a fall-through case, or adds an unconditional break; before important code. And we&#x27;re right back where we started.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter how much we safeguard and dumb down languages. We can load our languages full of red-tape: extra braces, no jumping or breaking, no fall-throughs, always requiring explicit conversions, no pointers, no null types ... all we&#x27;ll end up with is code that is much harder to read (and possibly write), while the mediocre programmers will find new and inventive ways to screw things up. It&#x27;s just as likely to make them even more lax, and attract even less disciplined programmers into important development roles. You know, since it&#x27;s presumed to be so much safer now.<p>The real problem is the amount of poor programmers out there, and the lack of repercussions for these sorts of things. A doctor that leaves a scalpel in a patient is (rightly) ruined for negligence. Do you think the &quot;goto fail;&quot; writer even received a written warning? Why not?<p>I&#x27;m not saying people can&#x27;t make mistakes, but I think your pay scale and the importance of what you do should come with some actual responsibility for your errors.

Lots of folks at USC-ISI were looking into proving the code expressed the specification, and the resulting executable faithfully expressed the intent of the code. End to end correctness as it were.<p>What struck me about that work was that invariably there was some tool you ran over the specification and the code and it implemented some algorithm for doing the work. And yet if you went that far, then you should at least be willing to run something like lint(1) and had anyone at Apple run it, or made warnings fatal (always good practice), the repeated goto would never have escaped into the wild (useless code is useless, its a warn in both GCC and Clang, and always flagged by lint).<p>So is the challenge the language?

That makes me feel better about my biggest crypto goof, which I had assumed was the stupidest mistake anyone had ever made with RSA, but e=1 is worse.<p>Briefly, I was doing a single RSA encryption on the client and corresponding RSA decryption on the server as part of a login procedure, and using e=3 (which, at the time, was considered acceptable by most experts). Due to licensing issues the client code had to be all ours, so I was using an old arbitrary precision integer library I had written years before. It was not super fast. The multiplication wasn&#x27;t too bad (Karatsuba), but division was the classical division algorithm. On the server there were no licensing issues, and I was using gmp.<p>So I had this &quot;brilliant&quot; realization. Why not do the division ON THE SERVER? The client could simply compute M^3 and send that to the server. The message would be 3 times longer but bandwidth was cheap. The server could then do the modular reduction.<p>I quickly made the change to the client and then started to revise the server code, when it occurred to me that since the client had made no use whatsoever of the modulus there must be a way to decrypt the message without using the modulus--like by just taking the cube root.

7599371,comment,7598721,7598721,1,0,maninalift,,,"Surely the key point is that most of us read indentation first, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether you are witting C with semicolons and curlies or ruby with no semicolons and &quot;end&quot;s or lisp with parens, what the programmer really reads first is the indentation. Those other things are sometimes checked afterwards.<p>Therefore there are two reasonable courses of action to prevent this kind of problem:<p><pre><code>  * use automatic code indentation\n  * use a whitespace significant language\n</code></pre>\nThe second is absolutely the better choice. You may disagree but you are wrong. This is not a matter of taste, it is a matter of programming language syntax actually reflecting what the programmer reads.",1397671265

7599369,comment,7599046,7599046,2,0,eldude,,,"tldr; Node.js&#x27; super light-weight cooperative-multitasking[1] allows IO optimizations only humans understand.<p>I agree with this whole-heartedly, but it does put the limitation on the human, and not on the computer, which is actually the opposite direction we want to go. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re there yet, so in the meantime, node.js is fantastic for when you need/want to hyper-optimize your critical code path for response time.<p>One thing I would add is that node.js makes job-queueing, background-task handling, side-effect inducing trivial since it makes networked IO / SOA trivial. In other words, having a separate process deal with anything not necessary for returning a response is almost effortless, allowing your responses to always take the minimum time necessary, freeing your client to continue.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking#Cooperative_multitasking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking#Cooperati...</a>",1397671245

Heathkit used to have folks build cables with Molex KK crimp on connectors (which was very time consuming) but you could combine things like power lines (AWG22) and signal lines (AWG28) into the cable bundle. Today there is a tremendous number of connectors for which making your own cable is problematic at best, for example the .5mm spaced IDC cables, or the FFC connectors like the camera connector on the RasPi. I looked into getting an LVDS connector for LCDs (typical laptop screen) to something more DIY friendly, tooling was $2500, and cables would be $25 each, minimum 10) Did I want to invest nearly $3K to get one cable? No, but if enough people were interested it gets to be lower cost. Setting up that infrastructure as a service (making cables in small to medium quantity) would be, in my opinion, quite aweseome.",1397671206

They'll want to see that they are getting consistently good info from your site before they start contributing (even so much as contributing their e-mail address or downloading the FFE.  And by ""most"" I mean this is me and I'm assuming I'm relatively normal).  Especially when you're competing against every other site full of error messages that shows up in their search results.",1201319859

I know I'm going to lose all 9 of my karma points for this, but: Michael Dell is successful in business and throughout 98, 99, and 2000 maintained that Steve Jobs should just ""give up"" and ""stop deluding shareholders"".  Good thing Steve Jobs is in the habit of listening to unsolicited advice.  So now that the whole world knows that even the opinions of rich, successful people can be totally off and worthless, what makes you  naysayers think anybody cares what you think about their startup prospects?  For all you know this guy's invented an algorithm to download terabits of video in seconds and is using this ""social alarm"" thing as a ruse ...",1201319025

1288410,comment,1287969,1288148,0,0,btilly,,,"<i>Most - if not all - software patents are bogus.</i><p>Many years ago I saw a lawyer say that he had examined a random sample of IBM's software patents, and estimated that about 70% of them wouldn't stand up in court.  And it was his belief that IBM had better patents than most companies out there.  The problem was, of course, that if they drop a stack of 15 patents on you neither you nor they know what they will get to stick, but they will definitely get you with something.<p>And why not file those patents?  Their main purpose is to be an unused threat, and they are threatening whether or not they are used.<p>Therefore even by the very relaxed standards the that US legal system does, most software patents are bogus.  If you hold a higher intellectual standard, then it isn't hard for that 70% to become 100%, or close enough to it to make the exceptions negligible.<p>(There is hope that Bilski will restore some sanity to the US system.)",1272038386

I have a MVP for you.",,"There seems to be gap in the market for an online ticketing system which is very clean and simple for people buying tickets, doesn't use PayPal, and ideally UK based. We needed one, so built a minimal implementation. People love our system and want to use it for their events. We feel it's too much hassle for a side project, so would like to offer the Ruby on Rails code and some introductions to potential customers to an HN user in London as a Minimal Viable Product.<p>--<p>Our company provides a SaaS information management system for small to medium companies with complex requirements. As part of our marketing efforts, we've run a couple of events, charging for tickets. http://www.oneis.co.uk/events<p>We looked at services like http://www.eventbrite.com/ and http://www.amiando.com/ . They were too interested in promoting themselves to our clients, resulting in a cluttered and horrible UI. It really is not something we would want our clients to see. Plus, they would have forced us to use PayPal, which I do not want to use for anything important.<p>As we already had a credit card merchant account in place, we decided to build a system ourselves, for two reasons. Firstly, to solve our immediate problem, and secondly, to show our potential clients how good we were at web apps. We got really positive feedback from the system from our first event, except that you could only buy one ticket per transaction. So, for the second event, we made it really simple to buy multiple tickets as well. Then people <i>really</i> loved it, and started asking if they could use it.<p>Turning this into a product is more than just putting up a web app. Sorting out tax, payments, liability issues and so on are too much for us to take on as a side project.<p>We have a very polished front end which integrates with PayPoint for payments through their advanced API (so the user never leaves our site, always seeing our hostname in the URL). It supports multiple attendees per transaction, VAT, optional extra items (eg books), free tickets and discount codes, the ""Verified by Visa"" system and clones, produces printable invoices, sends a confirmation email, has lovely URLs. Most importantly, it has absolutely nothing in the user experience which isn't absolutely essential to getting a ticket.<p>However, while the user facing side is ready to use, there is no event setup UI or back end system: we just used ad-hoc SQL queries to produce the attendee list and accounts and use a Ruby script to set up each event as it's needed.<p>We'd like to offer the code to a HN user in London (or group of HN users so pg doesn't complain about single founders) as a Minimal Viable Product to get you going, and introduce you to a few people who might use it. There are no strings attached, apart from an expectation that you'll make decent efforts to use it.<p>Obviously you'll want to see it first, so contact me, mentioning your HN username, and I'll send you some links. (contact details in profile). I'm not going to post them here because I don't feel like a wave of traffic to our production systems and the resulting tide of emails notifying us of fake bookings.<p>I'm very much hoping that someone can make something shiny out of this!<p>Questions?",1272036764

Get your hands on some polarizers, play with the affect of one and your ability to look into bodies of water (pool, lake, etc) show him that if you cross the polarizers you can't see through.  Couple the polarizers to the microscope and do some polarization microscopy.  You could also play with prisms and look at the dispersion of light.  Lots of good optics stuff out there.

Paul Graham talked about breaking the ""geographical monopoly"" of schools through online education.  I've worked in test prep for many years (Sylvan, Kaplan, College Network, Grockit, Veritas), and I've seen the same flaw in all of their classroom and tutoring offerings: If you live in a big metropolitan area, you have a better chance of finding a good teacher or tutor.  It's no coincidence that the best GMAT teachers are in Manhattan, because that's where Wall Street is.<p>This phenomenon is not unique to test prep.  I'm willing to bet that there are more Spanish teachers (and therefore a better chance to find great ones) in Los Angeles or Tuscon than in Boise or Cheyenne.  But since students usually go to school near where they live, they have to settle for what is available.  But imagine an online learning platform that let a student in Bozeman, Montana take Spanish from a teacher in Buenos Aires, English from a teacher in London, calculus from a teacher in Moscow, and art from a teacher in Paris all in the same day?  I think it would be interesting to learn about the Vietnam war from a teacher in Saigon.<p>When people talk about online education, they tend to highlight the isolation students experience.  I think it can be quite the opposite...it can be a more social experience than sitting in a classroom a few miles from home with an instructor and peers who likely share the same background as you.",1272034806

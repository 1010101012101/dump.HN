3574899,comment,3574338,3574338,3,0,rsheridan6,,,"Kind of interesting related snippet from July 2011:<p>>The morning concluded with a talk by Gary Landreth from Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio. Landreth has worked for several years to identify ApoE-directed therapeutics. As one of the genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis, ApoE is regulated transcriptionally by PPARγ and liver X receptors, which both form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). Working with APP transgenic mice, Landreth found that an RXR agonist, bexarotene, induces brain ApoE quickly and robustly. This induction precedes a rapid decline in brain amyloid, an increase in plaque-clearing microglia, and improvements in cognitive performance. Landreth noted that bexarotene is an FDA-approved chemotherapeutic that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and has minimal side effects, most of which are associated with its action on lipid homeostasis. Hence, this drug minimally represents a test of the role of Aβ in AD and, maximally, may represent an AD therapeutic, he suggested. The presentation elicited a discussion of the utility of the drug in ApoE4-positive individuals, i.e., if ApoE4 represents a toxic gain of function, then bexarotene-induced increases in ApoE4 may exacerbate AD. Landreth noted that the drug has been in use for roughly a decade without reports of cognitive deficits as a side effect.<p>From <a href=""http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=2850"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=2850</a>",1328859053

See, the lack of a ""concrete explanation"" isn't really a useful thing to say about something.  We don't yet have anything that could be called a ""concrete explanation"" of even things like gravity.  What we do have are theories that allow us to make useful predictions about how gravity will effect things.  Imperfect as those, like all, theories are, we've still put stuff on other planets with them.<p>There certainly are many ""open problems"" in science, but to my knowledge we have yet to ever encounter anything that is fundamentally beyond the grasp of the physical sciences.  Take for example the Coronal Heating Problem:  On the surface it seems to violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics (which is some <i>rather</i> heavy shit...) but even in extreme cases like that science solders on.  There are numerous hypothesis that have been proposed to explain it, and over time our understanding of it will only become more robust.<p>Anyway:  To address this <i>particular</i> concern I'd like to say that until we have any strong evidence to suggest that humans possess a more powerful model of computation than we already regularly reason about, we have to assume that they do not.",1328858149

3574867,comment,3573448,3573448,16,0,SarahKay,,,"I'm a girl in tech, and I think nothing in that introduction is offensive.<p>I feel that there are five points here that need addressing.<p>1. Women rarely become attractive by doing nothing. We have to work at it. You have to take care of yourself, go to the gym, eat right, choose appropriate clothing, and etc. I have never laid eyes on Rebecca Lovell, but if she's attractive then I think it is a safe assumption that she is <i>trying</i> to be attractive. If I were Rebecca, I would be pleased that my efforts had been noted and approved of.<p>2. If the fellow who introduced Rebecca had implied that her attractiveness was her <i>only</i> useful quality, I would be more sympathetic to Dan's complaint. But the introduction didn't do that. In fact, he led off by saying how smart Rebecca was, and then he went on to describe her as ""perfect"" (for the position) and ""talented."" At no point did he imply that Rebecca was chosen for her looks or that her looks were her claim to fame. On the contrary, his introduction seems genuinely kind, respectful, and affectionate.<p>3. Even if this introduction <i>had</i> been offensive -- if the introducer had said ""Rebecca is hot and stupid and we will enjoy looking at her while she moderates"" -- is it really that big a deal? Men insult each other all the time in similar contexts, and it's very rare that they get criticized for it as when women are insulted. If we women are worth a damn, surely our egos should be sturdy enough to handle this sort of thing like adults.<p>4. I have often heard men say ""No wonder there aren't more women in tech; they get treated like sex objects!"" It should be news to no one that men like sex -- least of all to women. People in all industries and with all interests are insulted all the time. Can it really be true that womens' interest in tech is so fragile and tenuous that vague insults and sexual innuendo are enough to discourage them from it entirely? I don't believe that, and I'd further venture to say that women who <i>do</i> say that are just making excuses because they're interested in something else. I got my CS degree from Georgia Tech, and in the College of Computing men outnumbered women 9 to 1. I was often the only girl in my classes, and sometimes I was exposed to immature male freshmen being immature male freshmen. This wasn't a trial for me; it wasn't difficult. I wasn't alienated. It sounds crazy to even <i>consider</i> that references to breasts or sex (gasp!) would make me leave my chosen field of study. Who cares if I know that someone wants to have sex with me?<p>5. Dan Shapiro is clearly trying to do right by women and be a good man, and I respect and appreciate that. But I think he is selling Rebecca (and all women) short by suggesting that that introduction should hurt her feelings.",1328857892
3574866,comment,3574380,3574380,1,0,yason,,,"This is totally off-topic but why, oh why, must publishers still break the stories over to 2-5 pages? Why is this ancient optimization still such a common and seemingly ever-continuing practice?<p>I understood it in the 1990's when bandwidth was scarce and downloading a 5KB beginning of an article made sense instead of downloading a 30KB complete text before you could evaluate if it's a good article or a bad article. But these days the text body is still few kilobytes but it is decorated with hundreds of kilobytes of images, advertisements, and scripting while the broadband could suck up even a lot more. So we actually end up using a lot more bandwidth because we have to essentially load the same article several times, at different sections.<p>Printable versions and Readability do help but it's still a nuisance.

You must have owned an Amiga if you know this matter in so great details :)<p>I did not know that for ""state of the art"" they drew the vectors by hand. Which is basically what Eric Chahi did for Another World back then, using rotoscoping. I am assuming that the technique they used for ""9 fingers"" is different though. They are WAY more vectors in 9 fingers than in State of the Art, and that would take a huge amount of time to reproduce them on screen. I am pretty sure they found a smarter way to do it (you can guess this from the fact that the video reproduction in vectors is almost perfect in 9 fingers, while in state of the art the animation is sometimes jerky and they use shadows/blur/changing background to hide the imperfections).",1328857419

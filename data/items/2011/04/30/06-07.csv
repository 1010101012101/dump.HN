2500069,comment,2498779,2498971,1,0,bo_Olean,,,"I am quite sure that client focused more on ""3-tier"" database, they never mentioned ""tier 3"". I designed database for the project, normalized as far as i could (80+ tables, still needs further table breakdown) but my database design got rejected. Another developer from team is supposed to design the database now. The reason my database got rejected - it was not a ""3-tier"" database.<p>Yes, I asked what they meant by ""3-tier"" database but i got replied with the wiki page on multitier architecture[1]. Which is what i am familiar with.<p>I am really confused with this term, never heard of ""3-tier database"". Requirements you mentioned match to what the client is expecting (<i>probably 99.9% uptime, up to 1sec latency, things like that</i>). I can't get the work back now but for the sake of clearing confusion I have, I would like to know about ""tier 3 database"". Could you please share some ideas on what makes a database ""tier-3""?<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture</a>",1304146715

The average programmer needs a tool, that can match his level of competence. This isn't just true in Data formats but also true when it comes to technologies.<p>Java and Python, are loved by the masses today for that very reason. So as long as eclipse and its Ctrl-Space takes care of 'filling up the blanks' most programmers will use it. Beyond that everything is irrelevant at least for the masses.<p>Now one fine day a cool Perl/Lisp/C programmer comes around and shows a you how you could do all that with more compact code along with flexibility and power and people suddenly realize what fun they were missing for years.<p>Verbose stuff tends to get very famous for a while and then just fades away with time, never to be seen again.",1304146657

Now the problem is somehow there is assumption that its difficult and costly to hire good C/C++ programmers. So what is the path taken? They tend to replace everything with Java. Now comes the actual issue, its easy to hire programmers who know Java. They come in volumes. Just post a hiring Ad, and thousands will land up at your doorstep next day. The actual issue is how do you separate the good ones from the bad ones?<p>Once you hire such programmers, you have to deal with technology addiction. Things like eclipse, XML etc the whole project begins to revolve around such things. In my project nearly everything is XML, config files, DB, persistence you name it. If its on a file its XML. This JSON in XML which is surprising most of you folks already exists in a lot enterprise code bases. Project managers seem to have a narrow vision, debates on issues like these terminate with 'It works, so we just don't care'.<p>I'm not against IDE's. But when your programmers can't do a simple deployment on test boxes, can't figure out even simple commands. All under the excuse of 'I only use eclipse', It begins to show up on the language community. Java in it self is not bad. But by reducing the barrier to entry to such low levels you are opening door for all sorts of toxins to come in.<p>I see Python is the next Java in making. Masses are flocking to it. As it usually turns out to be, most of them horrible. They just contagiously corrupt the whole community, spread the disease and once they are done destroying it they move onto some thing new.<p>After all you need to do something for a Job.",1304145210

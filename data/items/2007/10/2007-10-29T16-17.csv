Perhaps it is politically and morally wrong;nonetheless it remains extremely profitable. Further, Perkins doesn't offer a viable alternative for the world, besides urging people to consume less, which isn't going to happen just because some fancy economists want it to.",1193677173
73817,comment,73674,73780,0,0,anamax,,,"> Employee is a pretty loose term. He is doing some work (coding) in return for something of assumed value (stock or options). Just because he is not getting an actual paycheck does not necessarily mean that is not an employee of sorts.<p>That's true of them as well.

73816,comment,73609,73671,0,0,mxh,,,"I live in Silicon Valley.  My spending is actually down slightly from 2003 - that mostly appears due to minor lifestyle changes (eating out less, turned off cable) but is certainly incompatible with rampant inflation.  Cost-of-living looks basically flat.  I shop at the same grocery store (Draegers .... Mmmmmm) that I did in 2003.<p>On the other hand, I have noticed a spike in the office vending machine snack prices (to $.80/item!) and, of course, gas looks to have roughly doubled.  But neither of those are big expenses for me.<p>At the risk of engaging of contradiction, that 30% number doesn't jibe with my data whatsoever.<p>Have to disagree that current mortgage rates have little to do with current inflation rates.  Additionally, inflation is such a tricky thing to measure (because the prices of different things fluctuate with respect to one another, and through time, all the time - I can give you a (bad) argument that we're experiencing massive deflation by looking only at the prices of 100GB HDs) that it seems entirely fair to me to point out that someone's inflation statistic is incompatible with the behaviour of many, many people who are paid to get this sort of thing right.

73812,comment,73802,73802,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Possibly, but probably not in the way you're thinking.<p>Morgan Stanley is spinning off Discover Financial Services.  The MS options are for 100 shares of Morgan Stanley only.  The MQS options are for 100 shares of MS + 50 shares of Discover.  Hence the higher price for MQS calls (right to buy) and lower price for MQS puts (right to sell).<p>Whether this is an arbitrage opportunity depends on what you think the relative volatilities of Morgan Stanley vs. Discover Financial will be.  I'd advise not getting involved unless you know what you're doing.  (I certainly don't.)<p><a href=""http://www.optionsclearing.com/market/infomemos/2007/jun/23131.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.optionsclearing.com/market/infomemos/2007/jun/231...</a>",1193675899

73808,comment,73674,73674,0,0,webwright,,,"That's ridiculous....  Assuming it's really in ""idea"" stage, you should shoot for close to equal partnership OR a decent salary PLUS 2%, unless:<p>-the business is extremely capital-intensive (which a web business usually isn't).  If these guys need to dump their time AND millions of dollars into it, it devalues what you have to offer.<p>-they're far along in the process.  Sounds like they aren't, but if they've got months of value ploughed into the business, you don't deserve an equal cut.<p>-they have tons of strategic value.  If the business is selling toys on the internet and these guys have decades of relationships in the industry, that might skew the value.<p>Do the math on what 2% works out to in various exit events and do a bit of research about dilution if you think this idea might get financing some day.  If you DO get a better deal, make sure to understand dilution and have a decent buy/sell agreement that keeps you from getting screwed.",1193675555

73804,comment,73674,73674,0,0,ajkates,,,"It really depends upon a number of factors, though 2% does seem a bit low.  In my startup, the development end is receiving 50% of the total equity stake.  The other 50% is shared by those working on the business end (currently 1), in addition to those contributing the initial capital contributions.  I think this is fair overall, since we currently have three developers, each receiving 16.67%",1193674351

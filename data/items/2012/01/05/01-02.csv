However much Uber or Amex subsidizes the price, there are still X people that want rides and Y < X rides available, and the amount you the rider have to pay to win the auction is the same.<p>The anger came because Uber didn't do a good job of setting expectations. Their customers expected that they could get a  ride anytime, even NYE, if they were willing to pay a certain premium over what a cab would cost. But the premium on NYE was much larger than the customers (rightly or not) expected. If Uber had done a better job of managing expectations, they wouldn't have angry customers.",1325728512

3426926,comment,3426455,3426455,12,0,Construct,,,"Interesting behavioral study. However, the Scientific American authors make the conclusions appear a lot more concrete than they actually are.<p>Previously, researches have found that fluoxetine (Prozac) actually suppresses neuronal growth in vitro:<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20377614"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20377614</a><p>Fluoxetine treatment is often associated with an increase in BDNF (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor), a protein which encourages the development of new synapses in the brain areas responsible for higher-order thinking and other functions. At first glance this sounds great, as the Scientific American authors concluded. However, other researches, such as those in the study I linked above, hypothesize that this increase in BDNF and neuronal growth may actually be due to neuronal insult from fluoxetine. In other words, the increase in plasticity and new cell growth might be a healing response from the brain following damage caused by fluoxetine.<p>Furthermore, fluoxetine is an older SSRI with effects and receptor affinities that extend beyond the serotonin system. When using fluoxetine for research, caution must be taken to separate the effects on the serotonin system from the effects of other functions of fluoxetine. Without further study, we can't know if these effects apply to all SSRIs, or just fluoxetine.<p>I should also note: All of this is great for future R&D of next-generation anti-depressants, but it should not be used by anyone when determining a treatment path. Despite the study I linked above, to my knowledge we haven't seen any deleterious effects on memory or cognition due to SSRI treatment in the general population. The bottom line is that we don't know why or how SSRIs work (despite what the drug company marketing department wants you to believe), but they are effective for many people. And combined with therapy, the rate of remission improves even more.",1325728178

IOW, it can detect the shift from positive to negative (zero crossing).  The game server WAV files encode the game @ 48K samples/second using a single 12kHz wave for the zeros and a single 8kHz wave for the ones.  IOW, 4 pulses for 12kHz (2 +, 2-) and 6 pulses for the 8kHz.  The Apple II has a 1023000 cycles/second clock.  So I have to detect the zero crossing, chksum and write the data in 1023000/12000 ~= 85 clock cycles.  As long as the audio stream is clean and perfect (something only a computer or CD player can do), then it works every time.<p>If you load up any of the games in Audacity (freeware waveform editor), you can actually ""see"" the 0's and 1's.

I'm not entirely sure if by the ""gap"", you were referring to this, but just to clarify:<p>When I said there are sounds the musician hears and feels the audience cannot, I wasn't referring to the ability to pick out different sounds, but rather the physical impossibility of certain sounds (e.g., higher-frequency overtones, squeaking strings, rasping strings) to be heard beyond a certain distance away from the instrument being played.<p>To go off on even more of a tangent, I sometimes feel bad that not enough people get a chance to listen to musical performances up close.

I really like the idea of commissions to reward hard work, but either way you have to manage things right.<p>At one small company I worked at, the main sales guy received very little (if any) commissions. He didn't get many sales at all, but that wasn't a big issue since he had his salary.<p>At another, there were three sales people on commissions. One of them didn't sell much or provide much value, but he had in the past. As long as his old clients didn't leave, he kept getting paid (due to the way things were structured). This did not endear him to the other employees.<p>The other two sales people were very motivated by the commissions. They could sell a ton, which would be great if it wasn't for the way it was done. They were in constant cut-throat competition, trying to adjust things so their numbers would be 1% better at the other one's expense. This just devolved into a ton of fighting, eventually causing controls to be put into place to prevent either one from tweaking things. It was also easier to get a new customer to pay us for a few months than increase old business or keep them happy, so customer turnover was very high.<p>The best system I saw had one person working to get new business (on commissions), and once the sales was in it was managed by someone else (on commissions for keeping/improving their business). This removed the incentive to replace good old customers with fly-by-night new ones, but it was a very small team so I'm not sure it would have scaled very big.<p>Whether there are commissions or not, management needs to keep an eye on things to intervene when something is happening that's not in the organization's best interest. There are plenty of sales people (just like every other profession) that are happy to take advantage of companies if given the chance. Some people can do an amazing job for you, but need a ton of oversight.",1325726279

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor is a protein that facilitates plasticity, and there are a number of natural methods for boosting production of BDNF:<p>eat less; eat even less; fast once in a while; exercise regularly; eat turmeric; eat fish (or take a DHA supplement); do stuff with your brain.<p>I wish I had studies top of mind to cite, but most of this is summarized in a book called Power Up Your Brain: The Neuroscience of Englightenment (written by a neuroanatomist and a shaman). I read it after going on a 10-day Vipassana retreat and thinking that meditation is noninvasive neurosurgery. Effects differ depending on the style of meditation, but they all strengthen a fundamental pattern of brain activity, be it attentional control, physical awareness, emotional nonreactivity, compassion, etc, and there's plenty of studies documenting the neuroanatomical changes that result.<p>If you're interested in brain plasticity, look up Michael Merzenich, the UCSF research who coined the term neuroplasticity, on YouTube or TED.",1325725276

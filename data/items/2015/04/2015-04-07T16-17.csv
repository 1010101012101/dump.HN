Most Arduino boards (the Uno) are 16mhz with only 2kb of memory, so running a full FFT is possible but quite tricky and limited.<p>For folks that like embedded stuff and audio, check out a Cortex M4-based board like the Teensy 3.1.  It has faster floating point, much more speed and memory, and some basic DSP functions like FFT, etc. built in.",1428425988

It depends on the length of your runway (longer means you&#x27;ll have more time, obviously), how many other current folks have knowledge of the solution (and can offer code review or other guidance), how committed the applicant is (tough to judge, but desiring employment vs wanting a contract is a proxy), how far you are pushing what you are building (if it is a normal use case--crud app for rails--a book and a few days may be enough training time.  If it is not--high traffic erlang application--you may have a harder time training someone up without extensive partnering), and how hard it is to find someone who has experience with your current technology (there is an opportunity cost to training someone, but there is an opportunity cost to having an empty seat as well).<p>Certainly any senior developer worthy of the name is going to be able to pick up a language and be productive with it in a few weeks.

It&#x27;s brilliant.<p>The way Domino works at a high level is that you have a &quot;data&quot; and &quot;design&quot; template applied to a database. A database would be a single file on disk, and it&#x27;s something like a table (or a set of related tables) and various views attached to that data.<p>We had an internal Domino server with a set of internally focused &#x27;design&#x27; templates applied to them. We used the notes clients, and our analysts had their workflow applications there. The design of these databases was focused on serving content to the notes clients - not to a web browser.<p>We replicated the data from those databases to our staging and development machines. Those staging and development machines had their own designs - which was the web-centric, customer focused design. There was a minimum amount of information available to you in the notes clients - data at this point was meant to be seen in a browser.<p>Those staging machines pushed the data on to our final production cluster. Every 15 minutes something was pushed. We&#x27;d go from internal to dev/stage 15 after the hour. 30 minutes after the hour the data from stage would go to production.<p>We used normal build/release tools control the flow of design template replicas making their way out of their playgrounds, but sometimes it happened. I say it&#x27;s brittle because if you accidentally push design to the wrong place you could grenade a lot of stuff. More than once we accidentally flipped the switch to push design changes to development.<p>Here&#x27;s a link to a presentation of the last thing I was a part of in the Lotus community.

Other implementations are working on more and more platforms, including BSD&#x27;s.<p>They all adhere to the ACI open specification.<p>ACI is an open specification that anyone/everyone can contribute to (including Docker if they wanted). To date, there are more than 4 completely different implementations of ACI (one of which is Rocket), all written by different organizations. Apache Mesos is working on a 5th, and more are coming.<p>That makes the ACI have 400% more implementations that Docker&#x27;s &quot;specification&quot; which was written after-the-fact and is more-or-less a documentation of how Docker was implemented rather than an open specification in-which the community helped form.<p>ACI belongs to the community. It&#x27;s being contributed to by a large userbase and is growing rapidly.<p>This was the entire driving force behind ACI from CoreOS -- to get a standardized specification that anyone could implement. CoreOS saw the need for there to be more than a single container technology -- but they <i>must</i> be inter-operable.<p>It&#x27;s a lot like virtiualization before the OVF format came along. ie. If you made a VMware guest, you were stuck with VMware. After the OVF format, you could export your VM to an OVF image and import it into any other standardized virtualization platform -- you were not locked into a single for-profit company and carried at their whims.<p>You seem to think it&#x27;s about a &quot;money grab&quot;... well, sure if users adopt Rocket maybe CoreOS gets support fees etc... but if users adopt one of the many other implementations of ACI, CoreOS doesn&#x27;t get anything except a diverse ecosystem of inter-operable container platforms.<p>That&#x27;s a win for everyone.<p>CoreOS still supports Docker -- and I&#x27;ve seen nothing but praise come from the CoreOS camp. That doesn&#x27;t mean Docker is doing the right thing for the community at large -- instead, they are doing the right thing for Docker, the for-profit company.",1428424824

See [0] for the details.<p>Excerpt:<p><i>When the Arduino project started, the five co-founders (myself</i> [Massimo Banzi] <i>, David Cuartielles, David Mellis, Tom Igoe, and Gianluca Martino) decided to create a company that would own the trademarks and manage the business side of Arduino: Manufacturers would build and sell boards, Arduino would get a royalty from them like in many other businesses, such as in the fashion world. This happened in April 2008 when Arduino LLC was founded and the bylaws of the company specified that each of the five founders would transfer to this company any ownership of the Arduino brand. At the end of 2008 when Arduino was about to register the trademark in the US and worldwide, unknown to us and without any advance notice, Gianluca’s company Smart Projects — our main boards manufacturer — went ahead and registered the Arduino name in Italy and kept this news for himself for almost two years.<p>After the process of registering in the US was over and our lawyer tried to extend the trademark to the rest of the world, he realised that somebody had registered it already in Italy. We (Tom, David, David, and I) were shocked and demanded explanations. Gianluca reassured us that this was done to protect our collective investment. We were friends (or so we thought), so based on this agreement we kept working together for years, received royalties while quietly trying to bring the trademark back into the Arduino company through endless discussions that dragged on while Arduino became very successful thanks to the hard work each one of us put into it (and for a long time we didn’t even get a salary out of it).<p>As the project became more successful and sales increased, the attempts at regaining control of the Italian trademark registration became more and more difficult with larger and larger demands made to us while Gianluca effectively vetoed us from either bringing in other manufacturers or get any external investment. We made headway with Arduino creating a lot of innovation, pushing the boundaries of open source hardware, hiring a lot of talented people around the world and ultimately building an amazing community around the arduino.cc website.</i><p>———<p>0. <a href=""http://makezine.com/2015/03/19/massimo-banzi-fighting-for-arduino/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://makezine.com/2015/03/19/massimo-banzi-fighting-for-ar...</a>",1428424369

9335182,comment,9332889,9333490,0,0,Tiksi,,,"Reputation is a great judge of quality and for certain things, and absolutely awful for others. For things that take a great deal of base knowledge to properly evaluate, like cryptography, quantum physics, etc. relying on reputation is generally the best bet unless you&#x27;ve studied the topic for years. There is simply no way to objectively and properly evaluate them for a significant majority of people.  On the other hand, on topics that are inherently subjective, or topics that most people understand and end up having conflicting, subjective viewpoints, reputation is an awful way to evaluate the quality of content.<p>Most of the time on HN, reputation only contributes to the problem.  Comments and posts should be evaluated based on their content, not on the person posting them. Reputation only fans the flames of &quot;groupthink&quot;, &quot;the hive mind&quot;, or whatever you want to call the inevitable tribalism that exists in every sufficiently large community. Reputation has a way of turning subjective opinions into de facto truths, even on things that are unrelated to the source of the reputation, and how could you possibly have an dissenting opinion on the <i>truth</i> ? Giving a popular, well known, &quot;reputable&quot; name priority has a chilling effect on discussion, since going against them is a surefire way to catch some heat from the rest of the community. If reputation and the popularity of a name didn&#x27;t affect people&#x27;s views, celebrity endorsements wouldn&#x27;t be a thing.<p>The best system I know of is the one 4chan has. Everyone is anonymous, previous comments have no influence on current ones, and the only thing there is to evaluate is the content of your post. Since posts are ranked by time, not by score, every post has an equal opportunity, and it&#x27;s incredibly difficult to cheat. Obviously that system also has problems, and a lack of threading is annoying at best, but at least it doesn&#x27;t suffer from stifling discussion and punishing anyone who dissents.<p>The ideal system would be one where users have a per-topic reputation score, and the poster&#x27;s handle isn&#x27;t shown. This way eg. an expert on crytography doesn&#x27;t have any sway in a discussion about marketing. The fact that someone is revered for their knowledge of networking says about the validity of their thoughts on economical issues, and should have no weight in those discussions.  However I imagine this would be incredibly difficult to actually implement in a reasonable way, and could probably still be gamed, though it would be better than what we currently have.<p><i>Side Note: I didn&#x27;t (and can&#x27;t) downvote you, and I&#x27;m not sure why people feel your comment doesn&#x27;t deserve to be seen.</i>",1428424312

Basing a rule on use of electronic devices is the path states are going down to address both demands for cell phone location data, and directly obtaining location data through devices such as stingrays.

The fact that the economic system of the early industrial period featured an arrangement of property rights which favored holders of capital (corporations exist only as ideas, but their owners are real beings) who then exerted disproportionate power over all institutions of society, including government, leaving those capitalists the dominant power in all domains of life is why critics of that early industrial economic system named it &quot;capitalism&quot;, and the weaving together of corporate and government power driven by corporate influence over government remains a strong feature of capitalism. (Supporters of &quot;capitalism&quot; who have attempted to redefine &quot;capitalism&quot; to mean some ideal system of perfect market freedom rather than the actual system the term was coined to refer to often treat this as something other than capitalism, or as a failed form &quot;crony capitalism&quot;.)<p>More <i>formal</i> integration of government, industry, and organized labor is corporatism, top-down forms dictated by the central government of corporatism were features of Italian fascism and many authoritarian movements of roughly the same time. This has sometimes led to the equation of corporatism with authoritarianism/fascism, though this is an error: corporatism is substantially older, and has substantially broader reach -- it is no more equivalent to fascism than anti-communism (also a feature of fascism) is.<p>And, despite the rhetorical differences in <i>how</i> the integration works, such integration is also a feature of those Leninist/Stalinist/Maoist Communist regimes that either don&#x27;t go so far as to completely eliminate private industry, or which back off from it.<p>Which, taken together, illustrates the reason why there isn&#x27;t a term in general use for corporations (which are, after all, creatures of government) and government weaving themselves together -- its a feature of every economic system that has actually practiced in which corporations exist, from capitalism to the various reactions against liberal capitalism.",1428423531

Then anode is only ~16% of the entire battery, so increasing the anode energy density by 10X does not translate directly to 10X battery life. You must also consider the cathode, and separator which can hinder this. Remember the 10X is a &quot;theoretical maximum&quot;. It is important to constantly increase the theoretical maximum energy density. Translating the theoretical to an actual energy density is about downstream processing - see how Tesla increases battery efficiency each year by make the processing more efficient.<p>Amprius was promising 10X increase, but once they reach ton-scale manufacturing they were only able to get a 30-50% increase. I am sure they will be able to gradually increase close to the 10X maximum by making processing more efficient.<p>tl;dr battery material processing into the actual battery is where most of the batteries lose there performance.

Today&#x27;s &quot;deep links&quot; aren&#x27;t really about the links at all - after all they&#x27;re just URLs, nothing special there.  No, today&#x27;s deep links are about <i>publishing</i> those links in a way that allows 3rd parties to find them easily.  So, if you&#x27;re working in television for example, you might be interested in having a standardised way of publishing URLs in your program guide data, such that someone can access your catchup service directly from their television&#x27;s program guide application, without having to first load your catchup application.<p>Or in another domain, Yelp might publish an &quot;API&quot; describing how to construct a URL for a restaurant, using eg the restaurant&#x27;s name plus post code plus street name.  It might look something like this: <a href=""http://yelp.com/The_Olive_Tree/92100/Canal_St"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yelp.com/The_Olive_Tree/92100/Canal_St</a>  (I haven&#x27;t looked, maybe Yelp really does do something like this....)<p>Knowing this, a mapping application can now open the Yelp page for a restaurant directly from inside the mapping app.  Great!  Or maybe you&#x27;re a serious foodie - enough that you use a restaurant journal app.  This app can automatically extract the Yelp data to round out your entry, or alternatively, post your thoughts on the restaurant.  If there is a backend to this journalling app, it could even automatically insert deep links to your other journal entries so that other users can see what you thought about other restaurants. There is power in this idea, and it joins up with other ideas such as the semantic web.  At any rate I personally see deep links as a positive development.",1428423421

Yes, we&#x27;ve always been able to see people in public, but we&#x27;ve never been able to do it in a rapid automated fashion on a mass scale, or catalog and query natiowide databases. This creates new implications for privacy. In the past the government simply didn&#x27;t have the resources to know exactly what religious ceremonies, political meetings, protests every American was going to. Now they do.<p>This may mean an expansion of 4th Amendment protections (@sharemywin mentioned the idea of a new amendment, but I think this is exactly what the 4th Amendment is for). In Jones the Supreme Court said you can&#x27;t attach GPS devices to cars without a warrant, and 5 Justices said we may need this type of protection for location data generally. Since then many lower courts have applied this protection to location data generated from cell phones (even public locations), which I think is correct.<p>As far as setting a standard, I think the best approach is to require 4th Amendment protections for location data generated from an electronic source/device. This is what a number of states have been doing to address demands for cell phone location data and police use of stringrays. It also directly goes to the issue that electronic devices are given government unprecedented power to record, store, and query our location data, which makes that data more sensitive and suseptible to abuse.",1428423128

Their initial press release was filled with vitriolic rhetoric...so much so that they had to recant most of it. And coming so soon after Docker started talking about their orchestration plans, it&#x27;s pretty transparent that CoreOS doesn&#x27;t feel that the community needs and open specification. They feel that CoreOS needs an open specification to prevent Docker, Inc from leveraging the common implementation to gain an unfair advantage in the Docker orchestration market.<p>After announcing Rocket, they embarked on a campaign of subtly trying to show people how uncooperative Docker, Inc was being, first by implementing Docker support in Rocket and then that sham of PR (the first ever PR PR) where they implemented Rocket support in Docker. It was so much code and, with no warning that it was coming, there was no chance that it would ever get merged. The only point of that was to try to argue that they&#x27;ll support Docker and Docker won&#x27;t support Rocket. It&#x27;s so transparently passive aggressive to anyone that understands the underlying dynamic expressed in my earlier post.<p>> With something as critical as this technology -- we need an open specification<p>That&#x27;s fine. But there&#x27;s a right way and a wrong way to get there. They should have started by documenting the existing Docker implementation. It&#x27;s open source and implemented by many Docker partners (Amazon, Google, etc). Once the community has accepted the specification, as the authors, they would have license to go to the community and push for changes they feel are necessary. Docker isn&#x27;t fundamentally flawed, but it is flawed and I think even Docker, Inc admits that. There are changes that are necessary and they need to happen out in the open rather than behind closed doors at Docker, Inc.<p>Starting their own format was an attempted power move designed to fracture the community. And I see it as largely having failed. There are a lot of things that I like better about Rocket, but the ecosystem around it is way too nascent to even consider using it. There&#x27;s no collection of images that I, as a developer, can leverage to avoid building everything from scratch. Docker Hub is a big part of the reason to use Docker. And there&#x27;s no third-party integrations for Rocket. I can use Docker through AWS ECS and have the piece of mind to know that I can migrate to GCE and my Docker images will basically just work. With Rocket, I basically have to use CoreOS (a design I&#x27;m not thrilled with) or roll my own.<p>If either company seemed like it was trying to put the community first, I&#x27;d be 100% behind that company. But CoreOS&#x27;s rhetoric around trying to position themselves that way is simply indicative of them not having first-mover advantage. Both companies need to grow up and realize that this is a nascent market and there is room for both to succeed if they&#x27;re only willing to cooperate. But if they continue to squabble like little children fighting over a ball, the parents are going to take that ball away. Google and Amazon will roll their own proprietary containerization or, worse yet (for Docker and CoreOS), they&#x27;ll cooperate on an open standard. But the community is what&#x27;s important. If they can continue to grow the community, profits will follow. If they continue to try to corner the market and push each other out, the community will go elsewhere and both companies will fail.",1428423127

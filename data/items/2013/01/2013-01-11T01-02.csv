Many of the things C deals with like the file system and interprocess communication would be obsolete in a system with single address space orthogonal persistence. Running C on a Lisp machine will be possible but at a performance cost.<p>JavaScript would run faster then it does on Von Nuemman machines because it would use the hardware support for dynamic languages and since JavaScript runs in a browser independently of the OS, the new machine architecture and OS wouldn't be a problem. Haskell, in so far as its purely functional, would probably run the same as it does now.",1357869595

Yes, this means that my Macbook Air (2012) with the Apple Dual link DVI adapter works fine with it. However, my desktop with HD4000 mobo does not have DisplayPort so I'm now driving it with an NVIDIA GTX660 over Dual-link DVI.<p>Second, many of these displays output incorrect EDID information requiring that you manually modeset in Xorg to get it to work with Nvidia's proprietary drivers.

In what version of the universe are these negative things?<p>As for the ""professionals"" at the publishing companies, what exactly is their profession?  We do not need publishers to copy books for us anyone, because we have computers <i>that can copy the books faster, cheaper, and on a much greater scale</i> and if students need printers, they have access to them.  So what professionals would you be referring to?  Textbook publishing companies are not academies where experts in a subject spend their days writing about that subject; universities are the academies where experts (i.e. professors and researchers) are paid to write about their area of expertise.  Textbook publishing companies hire people who can make fancy covers (which adds no value to books), double check typesetting (which is a redundant task, since librarians and professors can do that), and operate machines that print and bind books (but we do not need that anymore, because we have automated ways to distribute books).

Like it or hate it, FP is absolutely nothing more than a pseudo-programming paradigm (largely emulating some concepts from astract math and using notation somewhat similar to math notation) that attracts people who can't wrap their heads around OOP, rich frameworks and other associated stuff. Sorry folks, computers are neither abstract nor stateless. And the same holds true for software, which often deals with real world stuff, which again, is neither abstract nor stateless. Virtually everything that can be done in a functional language, can also be done in a procedural or OOP language. The opposite on the other hand is totally untrue. It's really funny to see how FP advocates struggle even with some extremely basic things. Using languages/platforms like C/C++, Java,.Net - there's always an increase in performance compared to any functional language (yeah, including scala, f#, clojure ocaml an so on)
The ""elegant code"" argument is one of the most ridiculous things FP advocated come with, since it's almost always synonymous with crappy, cryptic code that no one wants to read besides its authors (maybe not even them after a few weeks or months) :D

Even if what you were saying was true, it would not be hard to solve:  universities could hire experts on formatting and publishing to work in their libraries and assist professors.  It is also not necessarily the case that every professor would have to write whole books; if books were being shared by universities via their libraries, professors could make corrections and improvements to books as needed, with the changes being propagated in a manner similar to patches in open source projects.

I think part of the reason they're able to do this is because college itself costs much more here. When people started importing international books, they started changing the questions in those books.<p>That's also how they are able to sell new editions constantly. Many subjects (math, mechanics, etc.) don't change much, but the publishers come out with different editions every 2-3 years so people can't just buy used books.<p>It's a ridiculous system, but hopefully open textbooks and online education will help change things.",1357866054

It's not much of a business today, because they still have not figured out a way to do that.<p>Those who have invested in Instagram either believe they will be able to figure that out, or they believe they can sell it to someone who believes they can do so.<p>This is no different than if I were to open a convenience store. I open it -- I'm losing money on rent, the renovations, inventory, etc, etc, etc -- I hope that after a certain amount of time I will be able to attract enough customers to make up for that.. but until I do, I do not have much of a business.<p>In a way, Instagram is at the opening stage. They're building a user base (what would be the store in my example). And when they figure out how to monetize the users, they will 'open for business' and accept their first customers (probably advertisers.. but they might come up with something else).<p>There is no contradiction, and there are plenty of analogues in history.",1357866014

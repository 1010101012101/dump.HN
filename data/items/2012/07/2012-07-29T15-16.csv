4308792,comment,4308327,4308470,2,0,grrabear,,,"If by ""school mathematics"" you mean algebra, then I completely disagree with you. Algebra is essential for almost every other mathematical concept, not to mention everyday tasks. Just because a computer can do it easily, doesn't mean that people should rely on them to do simple calculations when they could have easily learned how to do it on their own. That is terribly inconvenient and a waste of resources.",1343577597

4308786,comment,4308183,4308183,1,0,bediger4000,,,"Great, the ol' ""Argument from Market Share"", an essentially un-falsifiable hypothesis.  I mean, it would take Saruman, Gandalf and Dumbldore to reverse the proportions of machines with Windows vs Macs, vs machines running Linux. That argument basically excuses Windows and the surrounding culture from examination.<p>Perhaps Windows is the ""Dragon King"" of malware, and the Linux or Mac experience is more typical. After all, undocumented systems calls, using part of the file name ("".exe"") as execute permission, magic file names like ""AUX"", ""LP"" and ""CON"", and not documenting the entire list of file types that can execute might really contribute.<p>Untrue analogies like ""The biggest beast in the jungle has the most parasites"" don't help either, they're just more of the same excuse for Windows.  Does the biggest beast have the most parasites?  Maybe the most visible parasites, but I doubt the most. I personally would expect the most ancient clades of animals to have the most parasites: long-lasting clades of animals would have the most time for parasites to evolve.  Some recent paleontological work suggests that some disease we see in birds today may have originally evolved as diseases of the bird's theropod dinosaur ancestors. Since Windows preserves at least a measure of backwards compatibility to MS-DOS, maybe it has the most parasites as the most unchanged clade of operating system.",1343577483

4308780,comment,4308327,4308470,2,0,wcarey,,,"It would be interesting to understand how ""school mathematics"" displaced ""actual mathematics"" in our educational system.<p>I suspect that part of explanation has to do with computers. The word ""computer"" was originally a job title (see, for example the Harvard Computers: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Computers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Computers</a>). It changed meaning in the middle of the twentieth century when mechanical (and later electronic) computers displaced human computers.<p>It seems like much of ""school mathematics"" is vocational training to work as a computer. Unfortunately, we don't employ people to do computation anymore because the cheapest and worst computer you can but will be thousands of times more productive at computation than a human being.<p>If our mathematics curriculum was designed to train people to be computers, and that profession no longer exists, it's no wonder that school mathematics seems pointless and disjointed.",1343577346

I used Bootstrap to make the wiki look great everywhere. Couple that with the speech-to-text features in Android 4.0+ and storing your knowledge becomes effortless anywhere.<p>-   a Haskell plugin system.

So when the media makes it synonymous with ""cracker"", whatever, you know better. When a rockstar ninja who only knows one language for one general task calls themselves a ""hacker"", you know better. When a hacker you already know about mentions some other people or their work, you might want to go check them out to see what you're missing and if they're another hacker.

If you can read the language of maths, you can see patterns and understand things in the same way you can when you can read an article.<p>This continues to spill over until it becomes a negative selector, driving a preference for liberal arts type subjects over science and engineering, not by the positive virtues of the former, but by the perceived (and, probably at this point, real) difficulty of the latter - and further augmented by the fallacy that <i>any</i> college education is better than none.<p>We're happy to drill reading in schools, but loath to drill even the simplest maths. Only the most abject failures are allowed to go through school without being able to read a newspaper article at a reasonable speed and give a summary, but if someone breaks down having to do 12 * 9 in his head, it's fine, he's just not very ""sciency"".<p>Rant over.",1343574073

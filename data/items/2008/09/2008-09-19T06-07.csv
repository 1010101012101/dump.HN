It's used in this article.<p>It's a WebKit benchmark, so if they are using that to drive their performance tuning then this might lead to a bias (if you use a benchmark as your milestones you're going to get good at that benchmark, even a complex one).<p>Not saying they have, just curious.",1221807552

309032,comment,308332,308606,0,0,blasdel,,,"Bravo! People tend to boggle when I decry Lisp as being hopelessly low-level.<p>Sometimes ambiguity can be free, allowing indifference to how the machine works, without obscuring it at all. A good example is classical Hindley-Milner type inference (the algorithm that adds type annotations to plain System F code): it is fairly easy to construct oddball statements where annotating the types is undecidable or would cause resource exhaustion. But it turns out that for the known examples, it would be either impossible to decide the types in any form, or it would take O(c^n) bytes to enumerate the annotations.<p>So effectively there is no downside to the ambiguity -- the ambiguous statements are already infeasible for other reasons. Everybody Wins!",1221807487

309029,comment,307854,308712,0,0,netcan,,,"<i>I disagree with that definition of success.</i><p>Fair enough, but I hope it's not just a matter of semantics. My definition of the success for making educational materials available is making <i>education</i> available. The absolute goal would be 'the best education.' I admit, this is probably not the goal of this particular project.<p>Universities have an inherent interest in maintaining a big enough gap between free & premium education.<p>It seems to me that you're objections are base on an assumption that education cannot be acquired outside of institutions with an equivalent quality or ease. No chance. Universities don't have to worry about that, so no conflict.",1221807110

The competition clearly benefits everyone.<p>Obviously it varies between apps, but it wouldn't surprise me if the major bottlenecks in many applications are in the DOM access rather than JavaScript engine. It would be great if we saw similar competition on DOM performance.",1221806797

309007,comment,308701,308701,0,0,jbyers,,,"Wikispaces (a PBWiki competitor) had our Wikipedia entry deleted in August 2006.  At the time we were non-notable and had a medium- to low-quality entry written by others.  During our deletion process, we argued that it was perfectly reasonable that Wikipedia delete our article, but it seemed quite unreasonable to single us out of a dozen other non-notable wiki farms (not to mention hundreds of other non-notable websites) that were not being considered for deletion.  The response from the AfD commentors was in essence, ""fine, go ahead and propose deletion for the wiki farms you think don't belong"". We of course had no interest in doing that.<p>I was upset for some time that our article was deleted, but I'm not anymore.  Wikipedia's standards don't work for small companies.  In August 2006 when our article was deleted, we had less than 100,000 users and 50,000 wikis.  Today we have 1.4M users, 595,000 wikis, and a healthy and growing business.  A Wikipedia entry might be nice to have, but it doesn't have anything to do with how we serve our customers and build our business.",1221804370

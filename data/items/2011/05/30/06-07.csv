It is irreparably wrong. The idea that a given oxygen molecule (or an oxygen atom, or an electron) in BCE 44 can be identified with an oxygen molecule (etc.) in the present day runs fundamentally counter to the way the universe works.<p>Put it this way. In python, we have mutable variables, which have identity. so we can say<p>>>> a=b=[]<p>>>> c=[]<p>>>> a is b<p>True<p>>>> a is c<p>False<p>>>> a.append(5)<p>>>> a, b, c<p>([5],[5],[])<p>Starting out, a and b are <i>the same</i> empty list, and c is a <i>different</i> empty list. It seems naively that we could say the same of particles or atoms. That though we couldn't see it, or hope to trace its history, there existed some electron in 44 BCE that ""was the same electron as"" some electron today. But that is not how the universe is <i>implemented</i>. Every electron is the same as every other electron. Think immutable, not mutable variables. The state in 44 BCE is not ""electron #4892489 is here, and electron #4892490 is there"", it is ""there exist electrons here, here, here (etc.)"" (and they have thus-and-such spins, momenta, etc. etc.)<p>Edit: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/pl/no_individual_particles/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/pl/no_individual_particles/</a>",1306737286

So while you may not ultimately decide that pigs are worth more than bacon, you can at least imagine what it feels like to be the pig.<p>(Actually, when I put it that way, it makes me really feel sorry for the cow that I'm about to eat.  Unfortunately, I don't feel sorry enough to give up meat.)<p>Similarly, your actions are just if you can imagine yourself in the shoes of the less intelligent person and still say ""I am okay with the world as it is.""  Many times, people are fine with that - I've never gotten grief for working for Google and having free food, because people know how hard it is to get into Google and understand that if they put as many hours into computer programming as I have, they probably could get in too.  But sometimes, if you really put yourself in someone else's shoes, you realize that the world is <i>egregiously</i> unfair, and you can't in good conscience support certain actions.<p>Questions about character and morals almost always reveal more about the person answering them than about the world.  Are more intelligent humans worth more than less intelligent humans?  <i>Worth more</i> to whom?  God?  Judeo-Christian tradition holds that God loves all his children (except maybe the Philistines).  You?  Then this is a subjective moral question, and says a lot about you but not so much about humans.  Each other?  They probably have a wide variety of opinions on that.",1306736718

However, in addition to what has already been mentioned by olivercameron, there are couple of things that should encourage us to pause in completely dismissing lumier.  Firstly, good presentations and good products are not synonymous, nor is the opposite universally true.  Secondly, not having a full demo does not mean that the idea lacks value or relevance.  I think the key thing here is that Cullen had difficulty articulating his vision, or the product's promise.  Whether he proposes simply to skin windows (like a mac) and extend it into the cloud (like the Chrome notebook), or he envisions something else entirely, that was not made clear.",1306735368

So far about 50% through.<p>I take issue with some assumptions like our Neolithic ancestors were always on the edge of starvation. Hunter gatherer tribes in many parts of the world in pre-Columbian times and even today got along quite well and in many instances had as much or more free time than we do today.<p>That aside, the general direction of the paper seems to be that some concept of money or ""collectibles"" has been endemic with our species since very close to the beginning about 100k years ago. The author equates this as a process manifested from underlying genetic survival mechanisms.<p>It's very interested and I recommend others to read it.",1306735247

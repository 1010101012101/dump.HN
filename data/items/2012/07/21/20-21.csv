Are you free to open-source it or rebrand it? Did you have any kind of contract?What about your employment situation? Did your meetings with Sparrow's staff, and them sharing artwork, constituted some kind of licensing, agreement or anything? Did Google know about your project?<p>I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know any of the answers. Does anyone know what would happen if they claim that they own the code? Maybe they would have to recognize him as an employee, or a contractor and then pay him for his work. If they allow him to use the code as he pleases, the fact of the company encouraging him to develop the port, and even meeting and sharing some artwork, would it mean that they granted him an implicit licence?<p>Either way, probably Google's legal team has some work to do.",1342904394

The best due diligence is done by someone in the business plus an experienced accountant. Bankers only know enough about actual company finances to value them assuming everything is kosher. If something isn't kosher in the balance sheet, few bankers I know would spot it. Most trust the balance sheet and assume that if there were any shenanigans going on that the accounting firm would spot it (despite the fact that the accounting firm can just as easily be complicit). When bankers do comment in their reports on accounting irregularities it is only in relation to one of that firm's peers in the market and in the context of helping the bank's clients better be able to make a comparison of numbers when they don't measure the exact same thing.<p>FWIW I'm a former investment analyst at a broker dealer that has done due diligence. In one case I was working on the investment report for a tech company that was supposed to IPO. A few months later, after being fed up with banking and becoming interested in tech, I went to work for that company as a product manager. The due diligence I did as a banker and the reality I saw as an employee were night and day. My banking self didn't know nearly enough to properly perform due diligence.

And if Google now owns the IP, they don't give two shits about suing somebody making a copycat app of something they abandoned.<p>The problem is that good UI takes an absurd amount of work. It's the difference between painting a wall and painting a mural. With Sparrow to copy you'd have a good start, but you have to be enough of a UI devotee to even notice what makes a UI strong, and you'll still have to do a lot of user testing and polish.",1342900899

From the ambiguity of your description, it sounds as though you own the code, and that you had no formal business relationship with Sparrow, and that you accepted no money from Sparrow (it is really strange that Sparrow would even encourage you into such a position, and that you would put yourself there --- you left them in the situation where they could turn your work down, and develop their own Windows client).  If that is all true, then the code is yours, and you can turn it into a Sparrow replacement.  But you are giving off a sense of finality, as if what you wrote is useless.  This confuses me.   Think like an entrepreneur, not an employee.  If you have roadblocks to selling the e-mail client yourself, overcome them (e.g., if you are worried about UI copyright, then change your UI, and then sell it).  Once you earn money from it, move to writing a Mac version, an iOS version, etc.",1342900896

Any decent programmer will admit that they can't build a good and scalable <i>anything</i> in a week from scratch.<p>If you count your ""toolset"" as an entire framework that does what you want already, then sure, maybe it's possible.  Otherwise you're just being foolish.",1342900877

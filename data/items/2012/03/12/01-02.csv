3692017,comment,3690481,3691148,4,0,harshreality,,,"Applying the concept of leverage to the legal system is intriguing.<p>Leverage compels the innocent to plead guilty, and the thought exercise of ""crashing the system"" will not work because the stakes are too high.  There's usually evidence such that a refusal to plead guilty will not affect the outcome very much.  Applied to purely innocent suspects, there is no guarantee that refusing to plead will result in a not guilty verdict.<p>The same sort of problem is present in the investment markets.  The fact that something might be over-leveraged as the fundamentals deteriorate does not guarantee profits if you try to short.  To quote Keynes, (possibly the one thing he wrote that I whole-heartedly agree with) ""Markets can remain irrational far longer than you or I can remain solvent.""<p>It's quite possible that overworked juries and judges would wrongly convict more people by rushing to judgment if they had 10 times the caseload.<p>Crashing the over-leveraged legal system by flooding it with not guilty pleas may not cause the system to blink; instead, it might cause the courts to degenerate into a Kafkaesque nightmare.",1331517445

I was going to point out that rationality would alleviate the reluctance to jump off, post-education, but that supposes that doing a start-up is typically a rational act...<p>Generally, I think education allows you to lower the risk of achieving a given return.  Or, it could be seen as allowing a higher return for a given amount of risk.<p>Maybe that's the definition of a start-up: a company that sets a level of risk, then tries to maximise the returns on that risk?  A ""normal"" company does it the other way: sets a level of return then minimises the risk required to achieve the return.",1331517058

(I would suggest, with 8 char minimum passwords, that you only count passwords that are 8-16 or 8-24 characters long.  Otherwise a cat might try to test a several hundred char long password and the user will be locked out.  DoS by feline.)<p>Under your system, seconds per crack attempt is (900/N + 900/5 * N/256).  The first term is the number of pseudo-successful attempts with the fast 8-bit check, and the second term is checking those 1/256 passwords using the slow 5-checks-per-15-minute full auth check.<p>If you allow 40 8-bit checks before a lockout (N=40), you get 50.625 seconds per check.<p>Allowing full checks at a faster rate of 40 per 15 minutes, the second term disappears and you get to check at 22.5 seconds/check.<p>Obviously these decrease security, but if you're concerned about one check per 22.5 seconds, or even 1 check per 10 seconds, why would you want to decrease the effective check rate at all, from the nominal 3 minutes per check that's closer to standard?  I don't think that going from 50 seconds to 22 seconds is ""looking at the sun in a telescope""  :)<p>The 256 hash buckets are going to create collisions.  Given 8 char minimums, 7 incomplete passwords will be checked per user.  That's at least one collision for an incomplete password per 37 users  (7 * 37 > 256).<p>At least 1 out of 256 users will have the most common mistype of their password also collide with the real hash to 8 bits.  Their only option is to change their password.<p>An attempt to reduce collisions would further decrease the time per cracking attempt, and since rock bottom is 22.5 seconds/request in that example, I don't think that's so horrible a price for a boost in usability, <i>if you're going to implement this sort of password correctness hinting at all</i>.",1331516496

The visitor was amazed to learn that Minnesota then (and now) spends LESS per taxpayer on putting convicted criminals into prison, while spending substantially MORE per prisoner. Only the most serious criminals with long histories of offenses are imprisoned. Most convicted criminals receive sentences that involve community corrections but not imprisonment. Minnesota's maximum-security prison, the one I toured, had a population of inmates 97 percent of whom had killed at least one other human being before being put in that prison. The foreign visitor was a human rights lawyer, and he was actually amazed at how humanely the prisoners were housed and treated in that prison. (He had visited many prisons in his own country, and none were as well funded as the prison in Minnesota.) A prison can be properly staffed and funded, and not too crowded, if a whole state's criminal justice system is geared toward imprisoning only persons who must be kept out of general society, responding to most forms of criminal behavior with sentences that don't include prison time.",1331514670

3691897,comment,3691372,3691823,13,0,jonnathanson,,,"From what I've read and heard, one of the biggest contributions to prison population growth has been the advent of the predicate felony (""three-strikes"") laws in recent decades. These days, incarceration is like compounding interest. Get locked up once, and the next time you so much as look the wrong way at the wrong time, you're back in prison serving an even more severe sentence. In this way, someone with a string of nonviolent offenses does the same time as a violent criminal.<p>Prisons also serve to harden the imprisoned -- helping to ensure our country's record-high recidivism rates. Prison conditions are brutal. Gangs run daily life, and failure to join a gang can mean rape, severe injury, or even death. Of course, joining a prison gang means an indoctrination into the world of hard-core violence and reprisal. It's pretty hard to go to prison a relatively nonviolent person and emerge the same way.<p>Another big trend over the last 30-odd years has been a marked shift in society's -- and our justice system's -- philosophical view of the prison itself. Many years ago, prisons were seen as places to reform criminals -- not just to lock them away for a certain number of years, but to adapt them to a successful return to society upon completion of those years. These days, reform and adaptation aren't on the agenda. (Hell, good luck trying to find a stable job in post-release society with a conviction on your record). Modern prison is purely about locking people away and treating them as hopeless causes. More often than not, that hopelessness becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.<p>To be fair, some people in our society really are lost causes. There are violent psychopaths rotting in prison who should probably stay there and rot. But today's criminal justice system paints all offenders with that brush. Perhaps I'm a softie, but I choose to believe that a significant fraction of the 6 million is not beyond redemption.",1331514473

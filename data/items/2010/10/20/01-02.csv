1809648,comment,1809297,1809363,0,0,brehaut,,,"I recently rebuilt my site[1] in Clojure. Ring at the bottom layer (basically a given). Beyond that I'm using Moustache[2] for routing, Enlive[3] for templating and Clutch[3] to talk to CouchDB. I had previously tried with Compojure and Hiccup.<p>The hardest parts were learning enlive and moustache. Enlive is incredibly powerful and very clever, but can be a bit overwhelming for clojure noobs. You definitely want to check out David Nolen's tutorial[5] for it. Aside from that, #clojure and the ring google group are full of wisdom.<p>Deployment wise, I build the site with a basic leiningen[6] uberjar and run it from an ssh, background it and disown it. yeah, thats terrible, but im lazy and nobody visits my site anyhow ;) Caveat here: Clojure 1.2 has a small bug with interned keywords[7] that will knock my site over in a couple of days if i forget to start it up with the default JVM profile. the -server profile fixes the trigger issues<p>Aside from that, I have an nginx gateway server that handles serving my media, nowww redirection and proxies all dynamic requests through to the jvm. the site itself hosts a jetty HTTP server via ring to handle all the requests.<p>The 'hardest' part of getting started with clojure vs say Python+Django or Ruby+Rails is that there is a lack of 'get you going' magic / tools like scaffolds or djangos admin. Once you get past that though, it is a very enjoyable platform inspite of the API changes.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://brehaut.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brehaut.net</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://github.com/cgrand/moustache"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/cgrand/moustache</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://github.com/cgrand/enlive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/cgrand/enlive</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://github.com/ashafa/clutch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/ashafa/clutch</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://github.com/swannodette/enlive-tutorial/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/swannodette/enlive-tutorial/</a><p>[6]: <a href=""http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen</a><p>[7]: <a href=""http://www.assembla.com/spaces/clojure/tickets/444?comment=9542151#comment:9542151"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.assembla.com/spaces/clojure/tickets/444?comment=9...</a>",1287539964

You're also sure to get <i>all</i> of Friday by starting on the day before.  Wednesday gives little advantage over Thursday, but costs you another day before bug-fixing weekend / next week.  And early week releases are, well, too close to Monday.  Nobody likes that.<p>All of which is <i>wildly</i> subjective, and is merely justification and not reason.

Prop shops don't have a lot of capital, so they can dabble in high-frequency trading where the concern is taking single positions as fast as possible, and often earning rebates from the exchange to provide liquidity.<p>Having worked for both types of firms, I can say that ""quant trading"" is a pretty broad term.

I do see that is a problem sometimes in companies.<p>I think it's mostly a fault in recruiters as some of the more-technical positions are frankly over their heads, but nonetheless I myself have had a few failed interviews because the people weren't willing to take me on my word that if I am passionate enough about something, I WILL learn it and I will be GOOD at what I do. But that alone will not net you a job.<p>I think part of his problem is a lack of persistence. We are (for the most part) hackers of some flavour here, and hearing ""we'll get back to you"" when we know that's ""you will never hear from us again"" is unacceptable. So go hunt down the recruiting manager. If that fails, hunt down someone who likely holds a similar position and who you can impress to the point that they might vouch for you.<p>Take alternative routes, and be DAMN persistent and passionate about the job you are trying for, even if it may not be 'teh bestest job evar.' Make them believe that you think it is.<p>As someone commented below, they get tons of resumes (especially now). You've gotta stand out.

During that period, performance was crucial, partly because it enabled a smaller battery, and therefore a smaller and more convenient size overall. It does seem that iPods are now as light and can carry as many songs as anyone could want - that is, there is little room left for improvement <i>that people will pay for</i> (and I believe the last version of the Shuffle - v.3 - didn't sell that well, even though it was <i>tiny</i>).<p>At this point, the iPod market is ripe for commoditization. Since tech advances have made performance factors no longer an issue, there's an opening for the less efficient modular approach to offer other benefits, like cheaper price, more configurable and so on. But there's a problem.<p>iPod sales are down. They are being cannibalized by iPhones and iPads. That is, performance is now so good, that people would rather carry something heavier than an iPod Shuffle in return for more functionality (like movies, phone calls, internet and apps). I haven't checked, but I imagine the current iPhone probably has similar weight & size to the first iPod.<p>In these new categories, performance again becomes a premium: people would love a faster iPhone, that has more memory, that is lighter (where ""love"" means ""would pay for"").<p>To summarize: the iPod digital-music-player category wave didn't last long enough to become commoditized.<p>But note that my key point remains: Apple needs a pipeline of products, where its integrated approach gives a competitive advantage.",1287536815

The impression I got from reading about Common Lisp on the 'net was that it was old, its libraries are hard to find, and when you find them they are poorly documented and unmaintained. And if you're not using emacs to write it, no one is going to help you. I've installed several versions of emacs on my computer... but decided in the end I didn't really want to learn lisp and emacs at the same time because it didn't seem <i>fun</i> anymore, just <i>work</i>.<p>At least there are more blogs about Clojure; and Racket is mature and well supported. (I also think Clojure code looks better than all the other lisps. Don't know why, yet.)",1287536453

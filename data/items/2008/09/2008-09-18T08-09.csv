You can get Coke in places where there's no running water.<p>They way I see it, Coke's goal is:  1) to make you want a Coke whenever you're thirsty (that's the marketing), and 2) to make it very easy for you to get that Coke (that's the supply chain/logistics part)",1221728267

The important thing is to keep it civil - to say things that you'd feel comfortable saying directly to the people involved.<p>Personally, I am kind of skeptical of 37S in that they talk a good talk, but... I have a sneaking suspicion that their true scarcity power comes from things like Rails and their blog.  Or maybe not; it's hard to tell without doing some very in depth research.",1221728243

308027,comment,307918,308024,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Well, it's not stagnant. The formula is (other than the change to HFCS perhaps) but the marketing, which is the true product, is not. What New Coke taught is that people aren't buying a drink for the flavor, they're buying the physical representation of good marketing and the positive emotions that come along with it. They've never stagnated in that aspect.",1221727540

My mother always says that violence never solves anything.<p>RASCZAK
Really ? I wonder what the city fathers of Hiroshima would have to say about that.	You.<p>CARMEN
They probably wouldn't say anything. Hiroshima was destroyed.<p>RASCZAK
Correct. Naked force has settled more issues in history than any other factor. The contrary opinion 'violence never solves anything' is wishful thinking at its worst.<p>RASCZAK
People who forget that always pay... They pay with their lives and their	freedom.<p>RASCZAK
You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?<p>JOHNNY
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it,	if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.<p><a href=""http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Starship-Troopers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Starship-Troopers.html</a>",1221726654

308005,comment,307722,307888,0,0,thwarted,,,"DO NOT USE THIS REGULAR EXPRESSION FOR ANYTHING.<p>This is a terrible example.  First off, you're using double-quoted syntax, but it's not in double quotes.  Additionally, you're confusing when regular expression metacharacters need to be escape because they're metacharacters and when they need to be escaped because they are in a double-quoted string.  The PHP documentation is particularly terrible in this regard (telling you to put regular expressions in double quoted strings rather than single quoted, because PHP doesn't have a regular expression type).<p>[-\.\\w]  means match a dash, a dot, a backslash and the w character.<p>Secondly, it's not anchored to the start or end of the input.<p>Thirdly, the LHS can be empty according to this regular expression.<p>Lastly, we've finally uncovered who it is that's keeping everyone from using + on the LHS to do sendmail style +folder references.",1221725857
308004,comment,307918,307918,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Windows was/is a great product in many senses. Great is not a word with a single application to an OS.<p>Windows was great in that it allowed multiple hardware vendors to compete on hardware without having to also design their own OS. It was great in that it allowed multiple corporations to market the same platform. And as it grew, it was great in that it allowed developers to write an app once that ran nearly anywhere.<p>There's a lot more to ""great"", as applicable to an operating system, than even usability, stability, graphic design. A lot of times the things you value, as a developer, aren't what the general public does. You might want an OS that's very much like Linux but with a much better GUI. Most people just want their PC to cost $300 and run any program they buy or have bought in the past.<p>So Microsoft's OS was clearly great by far more people's definition of the word than Apple's, and it reaped the rewards.",1221725789

ITunes on Windows is awful. My iPod headphones are really annoying.<p>But I have had the above experience every time with another product: vim (the editor). Whenever I'd think of a cool feature, it would already be implemented, with lots of associated features that I hadn't thought of yet. Impressive. OTOH, hard to find the damn features, unless you already have the idea for them (like google). So, vim could be better designed in that sense (no, I don't know how one would do that).",1221725653

I've used it to watch Escapist videos, to order a pizza at a local pizza place that inexplicably uses Flash for the entirety of their site, and on and on. 99% of the time it sits disabled, but when there's the little box and I actually want or need to see the content, I tap it and voila, a few seconds later I have it.<p>Of course not <i>all</i> Flash works (though I come across very little that doesn't perhaps because I consider it an emergency technology, not the foundation of my experience). Some instances rely upon keyboard input, or hover events, or other interaction mechanisms that I can't duplicate on my smartphone.<p>Which is exactly like many HTML sites (where keyboard, hover, and drag-drop functionality that can't be duplicated on a mobile device is often used. I've yet to find an HTML5 demo game that actually works). Do we say HTML is failed because not every site works perfectly on mobile devices? Abandon the whole platform and embrace the App Store?",1283263144

You are buying a read-only pass into the walled garden.

Perhaps part of it was the overall novelty of personal computing, as there was still so much totally new development going on...  but I sure didn't have that same enjoyment factor when using IBM-PC clones or even Macintoshes of the same era.<p>I think, maybe, somehow, probably unintentionally, the Amiga captured the 1970s/early-1980s ""hacker spirit"" better than any of the other personal computer systems.

I would advise (my personal opinion) women to avoid such services and deal with the hassle of getting a cab.

That is why I always take a taxi or use a well-established car service (as in substantial with a fleet of cars) instead of trusting someone who is able to drive you around because he/she filled out an application and leased a fancy black car. At least there is some accountability with taxi and fleet drivers. And unless UberCab does serious due dilligence on their drivers (perhaps they do?), I would stay away from this service (again, if I were a woman).<p>Edit: Please note that I do not mean to imply that all car drivers are bad people.

It also gives a chance to read associated information in editorials, etc, which often may be of interest. It is also a way for us to credit the journal.<p>We accept that linking to the specific research paper itself is often a desirable thing to do, and it is certainly something we will try to do more of in future. However, we don't believe that it is something we can do on every occasion - for instance many papers are available on the web via subscription only, while others give only an Abstract summary. In these instances, the vast majority of our readers would not be able to read the full papers, without paying for access, even if we provided the relevant link.<p>In addition, we do have finite resources, and our view is that our top priority should always be to provide authoratitive, accurate and attractive reportage. We have to balance that against the desirability of providing a link on a story which is likely to be of use only to a small number of our readers.<p>We have sent out new guidelines to reporting staff summarising our position, and stressing that linking to individual papers is something they should consider as an option on each story.""<p>Which he (and I) thought was a bit rubbish.

The image of the lone hacker sitting down and pouring out a bunch of code straight from his brain is a romantic one, but if you haven't spent a little time deciding what your data structures are going to look like and how you're going to pass stuff around, etc., your code will be crap. ""Just coding it"" leads to both frustration as you sit wondering what you should be writing and why programming is so hard, and poor code. The poor code comes in when you start throwing in stuff like one-use elements in your structs to keep track of something you hadn't forseen, when a little bit of planning could have alleviated that.<p>I'm certainly not saying you should go write up a design document complete with UML and everything.

As I played Castle, I noticed the manual for the Applesoft programming language sitting next to the computer. I cracked it open and realized I could break into the monitor and see the source code.<p>I did just that, modifying the game to the point it was no longer playable. I had saved the file and effectively broke it. I shut off the computer, and never told my uncle.<p>The excitement of that moment stuck with me and was the enabler of the amazing life I've had since.<p>Thank you Steve Jobs. RIP.",1317859039

Scrolling the page disables ALL transform repainting until the scroll has completed, so if you want to do anything fancy during a scroll you have to disable native scrolling and simulate it with scrollability (or something similar). iOS does not handle images well, especially high-res images (or many small images). Nor, sadly, does it handly opacity transforms well.<p>There are hacks to get around most of these limitations, but if you are, say, in a situation where you want to animate a series of images in a manner that involves opacity, you're going to get a royal headache. Think that's not that common? It happens more often than you'd think, usually in the form of fancy transitions between UI elements.",1317858624

Fix the needle-haystack vs. haystack-needle inconsistencies, function naming conventions, and so forth.<p>The adoption rate of a new major version on shared hosting providers is relatively slow, so it'd be a perfect time to really shake things up and clean it up.",1317857322

It is true that it will look different from different angles, but that isn't all that impressive. You could say that a television is sort of like a painting that moves. If you were to take a painting and then wrap it into a cylindrical shape, that wouldn't make it 3D, it would just make it differently shaped.<p>Likewise, this technology just projects onto on oddly shaped object. It doesn't magically add any of the depth feeling that you get from, for example, watching a movie with 3D glasses.<p>The reason this is so difficult is that when you view a real object, it reflects light in all directions so that your eyes actually see two different images when you look at it from two different angles (your two eyes, or any other arbitrary viewing angle).<p>Imagine that you were trying to make a projector that no human would be able to distinguish from a real window. Imagine that you had the requirement that the user would have to be able to look in different directions out the window and get different views just like a normal window would. What you would have to do is create pixels that can project different colors in different directions and maintain complete control over which color was projected in each direction. In short, you must create a pixel that will look different depending on which direction you view it from.<p>If you think of it this way, you basically would have to control each pixel as a series of subpixels, each subpixel pointing in a specific direction. To make it realistic, you would probably need thousands of subpixels for each pixel, increasing the requirement for number of pixels by thousands of times and decreasing the required minimum size by thousands of times. Also, you have to make the subpixels point in only one direction.<p>And that, my friends, is almost impossible.",1317857298

3078065,comment,3077165,3077165,2,0,protagonist_h,,,"Good explanation of benefits of being in a startup hub. However, are there advantages to being OUTSIDE a hub? I can think of at least two:<p>* Living and working outside a startup hub, you are more likely to encounter a problem nobody else has worked on before. In startup hubs, you have large number of startups working on small number of similar problems, while large chunk of profitable opportunities remain untapped. Why? Typical startup people don't encounter these problems. They are not talked about on startup blogs and you won't encounter that problem walking down University Ave in Palo Alto. In many cases, these opportunities are taken by old school, dinosaurs-like software firms who overcharge customers for their crappy software.<p>* Living outside a startup hub, you are exposed to users who are a good sample of the general population. This is not true for startup hubs, where users a lot more tech-savvy. While it seems at first that being surrounded by tech-savvy users is a good thing, this in fact may be a problem because building your startup based on feedback from these users may steer you in the wrong direction. You end up with couple of thousand ""early adopters"" who are enthusiastic about your product, but you are not able to expand further because your product just doesn't resonate with a true average user. On the other hand, if you can get a true average user to be your early adopter, the feedback you get from them will help you make a product which is attractive to a large number of users.<p>Of course, hubs are way overrepresented in the past success stories. However, more startups are started in the hubs, so it's not clear how actual success rates compare. I would love to see some stats for that.",1317857159

By the time my contract ended, the 4 was 8 months old and I decided to hold off on upgrading until the 5 came out.<p>By releasing a 4s, Apple is most likely signaling that there will be a radically new phone released soon. (less than a year) I'm going to get a 4s (the new features are great and I can't really wait 6 months) but I probably won't ever actually get the 5 due to carrier lock-in.",1317855921

If you think there's nothing wrong with the patent system, then you should be ""pissed"" about that too. But sane people tend to not be.",1317855916

About the reward; the returner does not know what the reward will be, however we do mention that there is a minimum $20 reward.<p>The business is built around the idea that the general public is good. They generally want to return someone's lost stuff. What we've found so far is that the label just makes the process possible, and painless.<p>That's why we have the ""Good Karma"" badge :)<p>2. Thanks, I have fixed the typo.<p>3. About the expansion with tamper proof stickers, that's certainly a possibility. We haven't done much corporate business yet, so we're not sure the demand for that sort of thing. Our early customers have mostly been individuals.<p>Thanks again for the feedback.",1317855721

Adobe - Flash
Google - WebM<p>Calling Apple out as if they are some how evil here is disingenuous.

The thing about the HTML5 spec is that it doesn't actually specify what <i>format</i> the video should be in, so different people use different formats and AFAIK no browser supports all the common choices out of the box. It's an unfortunate state of affairs, but it seems essentially irreconcilable  this is why WebM could have been a big deal. Apple chose to use the QuickTime file format here, presumably on the assumption that iPhone users will have iTunes installed and QuickTime with it.",1317855652

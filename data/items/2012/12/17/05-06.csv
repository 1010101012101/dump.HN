On 9/10 David Rumsfeld, the US secretary of defense, hold a pres conference (it's on CNN.com, etc.) and stated there are 2.3 trillion dollars, that the Pentagon cannot account for.<p>2. On 9/11 a part of the Pentagon, including the budget analysis department rooms, was destroyed. Most of the victims were accountants.<p>3. Same day WTC building 7 (not mentioned in 9/11 commission report, not investigated by any other authority) was destroyed in NY. Pentagon's primary financial information backup site was inside.<p>One out of the many, many ""coincidences"" on 9/11 ...",1355723972

I'll give you both points, but I'm not sure how they relate to my comment or the parent. I don't believe guns are inherently evil. The are just things. Clearly my parent believes that they are evil and nothing I say will change his mind but that's neither here nor there.<p>>Regardless, the earlier comment of ""please don't take my guns away"" serves to create a false dichotomy. It's perfectly possible to create meaningful firearm safeguards without going out and confiscating your personal weapons of watermelon destruction.<p>I don't think it is. As I said somewhere else in this thread, the cat is out of the bag. There are far too many readily available firearms for there to be any meaningful gun control in this country short of completely outlawing them AND confiscating them with a search.<p>There are already lots of firearms safeguards, including background checks, waiting periods, etc. Most people who post on boards like these and say we should have tighter gun control have no idea what that means, or what kind of gun control we in place now. Most of it is fine (in places like TN where I live) some of it is absurd and IMO unconstitutional (in places like DC and NYC). DC has some of the toughest gun control in the country and yet also has some of the highest gun crime rates in the country. Taking guns away from lawful citizens just means the criminals don't have anything to be afraid of.<p>To get my handgun carry permit I had to go to a class, pass a written test, pass a shooting test, pass a background check, get approval from my local sheriff, and all of this came with a waiting period. (Now, simply buying a gun is easier, but it still requires a background check unless you are purchasing from a private individual). What is it that you (or anyone else) would propose we add to this? You already can't legally buy or own a gun if you are a felon or have any history of mental illness. There are however plenty of guns available for them to buy from private individuals who don't know you are a felon, or alternately they could just steal them.",1355723147

This is simply what people do when they construct a ""proof"", which is of course not a proof, but that is another issue altogether. Alonzo Church says that derivation can entirely be done by (1) renaming (=alpha) (2) application (=beta) and (3) substitution (=eta). I think that Alonso Church is right. That summarizes the only technique that pure mathematicians seem to be capable of, which is indeed a bit poor.

Anybody reasonable would have seen the notices and removed the code. The idea was that this way I'd know how many script kiddies were abusing it, and if maybe it was a bad idea to keep it up there. Well, in fact I did get a lot of connections, and it was kind of horrible to see. Then I forgot about it, until seeing this post. So I figured, either I take it down, because script kiddies, not people who are merely curious to see how a key logger works, are using it, or I keep it up there. In the end, I decided to stop being a dick, remove the connection thinger, and now the HN crowd will hopefully find something interesting to learn in it. A failed experiment at dealing with the script kiddie situation, oh well. At least, now, my code is untainted.<p>Anyway feel free to email me or leave a comment here if you find any bugs or have patches, or whatever.

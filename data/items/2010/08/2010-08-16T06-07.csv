1607057,comment,1606770,1606770,0,0,timr,,,"Looking over this list, I think the problem with the ""business co-founder"" is clear:  there's simply no such thing as ""business"".  There's copy editing, user support, PR, HR, operations, accounting, legal, etc.  And if you're going to work at a startup, everyone needs to be good at many of these things.  Skill -- actual skill -- is at a premium.  There's no room for the guy who wants to boss people around and think big thoughts and call it ""business"".<p>Too often, the guys who you run into at meetups and valley social events are what are best characterized as ""useless douchebags""; they have no marketable skills or experience, but plenty of ideas that they'd like <i>you</i> to work on (typically for free).  But real, valuable, ""business"" people have hard-won skills.  Real business people are accountants, lawyers, salespeople with experience and contacts -- people who have something with more value than the ability to talk a lot and go to parties.<p>Thus, I don't think it's interesting to debate the question of the business co-founder, because it's not a useful categorization.  If you're starting a business, you're a business co-founder, by definition.  You might focus on code, but you're going to have to worry about a lot more than that if you want to succeed.  It doesn't matter what you call the person sitting next to you, as long as they're contributing.  And if they're not contributing, you're in trouble even if they're a hacker.",1281941174

There was no real tourism, no manufacturing, little resource industry, nor a knowledge economy. It was all hype - in the same way that we frown and look down upon the unrealistic, borderline scammy dotcoms of yesteryear, we look on Dubai with some disdain for what we perceive as dishonest business.<p>I may disagree with the politics of, say, China, but one cannot deny that their economic rise to power was based on real growth, in real industries, providing tangible benefit to people.<p>Secondly, the objection to Dubai (and the schadenfreude you often see at its downfall) is fueled by the notion that much of Dubai's construction and service industry was built on indentured labor, if not borderline slavery; the labor abuses in Dubai during its hey-day would make a 19th century robber baron blush. Hell, if the reports are anywhere near accurate, labor conditions in Dubai makes a Chinese sweatshop a veritable paradise.<p>So, in short, the perception (whether or not reality jives with this will be answered by history) is that: Dubai was built on hype, no real substance, fueled by shallow people, upon gross human rights abuses.<p>It is far from as simple as making bad business decisions.",1281940793

Further, they're not splitting all the profits with everybody, but just 1/5th of them, and you would get 1/9th of that even though you'd be %25 of the workforce. Meaning they keep %80 of the profits and all the equity.<p>You'd be better off going into competition with them.  I'm sure you can find an engineer like the one engineer they have and split the equity 50/50.

Thanks for that :)<p>--edit-- My own thoughts were along the lines of - humans decide we&#x27;re probably in a simulation, and try to figure out how we could attempt communication with the simulators. To do so we decide to build our own simulation, then run it at double speed and watch how they try to communicate with us.

Then, they go on to assert &quot;computers (or whatever) cannot (currently) do X, therefore we need to create a grand theory of X to create <i>Artificial (General) Intelligence</i>&quot; (or &quot;computers cannot do X, therefore A(G)I is doomed&quot;).<p>Unfortunately, they never seem to provide proof that X exists, or is true. Sure, you can provide a plethora of examples of creativity, but the plural of &quot;anecdote&quot; is not &quot;data&quot;, the plural of &quot;data&quot; isn&#x27;t really &quot;proof&quot;, and I don&#x27;t know what creativity is well enough to tell what I do commonly (or even occasionally) is creative and a forward-chaining formal logic thingy printing out a novel, true formula isn&#x27;t creative.<p>Ultimately, that is why I like the Turing test---I don&#x27;t have to understand all sorts of magical X&#x27;s, all I have to do is to give you the benefit of the doubt if you don&#x27;t have to have a bunch of truly arbitrary conditions on what you do.",1386957439

For example, I make a shell out of depleted uranium, then I coat it with a coating of strong heat insulator, then I coat it with a very reflective surface, then I &quot;spin&quot; it while I fire it. First the laser reflects, but even if enough energy gets to the absorption layer, how does it penetrate through the material? You would need gigawatts at the very least to have a physical force (since light particles have such little mass). Is it because even thermally resistive stuff burns at some temperature and the interface layer smokes off, no matter how thermally insulative?",1386954137

However, I see three main bad reasons for the recent explosive growth in the FIRE sector:<p>1. Their cost of borrowing is artificially low. They don&#x27;t need depositors anymore. They can borrow limitless funds from the Federal Reserve now at 0.25%. Their real borrowing rate is actually negative if we&#x27;re honest about inflation, rather than relying on fabricated government numbers that leave out housing, healthcare, food, fuel and education.<p>2. The Fed is creating artificial demand for financial products. After the 2008-9 crisis, the Fed has created $3T out of thin air and used half of it to buy mortgage backed securities.<p>3. Over the last 30 years, the federal government has shown its willingness to bailout failed financial institutions that took on too much risk-- We saw it with the S&L crisis of the 1980s and 1990s; we saw it with the 1998 bailout of LTCM; and we saw it again with the $700B TARP in 2008.<p>If we would simply allow the free market (rather than The Fed and federal government) to determine interest rates, and the demand for securities, and the appropriate level of risk appetite, then we&#x27;d see the FIRE sector shrink back to its historically low share of GDP.

Besides Amazon states in their TOC that they can change quality as they see fit at the time of a video being played.<p>- Insistence on specific playback tech. Amazon Instant mandates Silverlight and the playback is choppy on my media centre PC due to Silverlight&#x27;s graphic acceleration issues.<p>- Lack of audio track (and often subtitle) options: in UK that&#x27;s English only. I want to be able to watch films dubbed and have a selection of translations that are already available.<p>More generally I am opposed to the prepackaged nature of the paid service offered and lack of control over how and what I can watch.<p>Some alternative ways of viewing the content offer me great choice and full control over:<p><pre><code>  1. Title I choose to watch.\n  2. Video quality.\n  3. Audio quality.\n  4. Audio track. \n  5. Subtitles.\n  6. Streaming vs. download, so I can make the best use of my connection.\n  7.

Much of this can be alleviated with templating (ng-view).<p>Have you taken the time to play around with angular before airing your grievances? My hunch is yes and that you may just be simplifying things for others who haven&#x27;t used it yet.<p>For those of you who haven&#x27;t had the pleasure of working with angular: Once you&#x27;ve familiarized yourself with the verbiage, most of jeswin&#x27;s concerns here come second nature just by glancing in one&#x27;s source code. Let&#x27;s take the example:<p><pre><code>    form.length.$error.float\n</code></pre>\nThe name form, albeit horribly chosen in this case, represents the parent form&#x27;s identifier in angular (the form&#x27;s name attribute). It would&#x27;ve made more sense to use <form name=&quot;formLengthValidationDemo&quot;> or something more insightful so you could more easily see the name matching from HTML to JS.<p>$error is simply the representation of any form validation errors that may have occurred. It&#x27;s standard in angular, and there&#x27;s plenty of documentation. Just google for &quot;angularjs form validation&quot; and you&#x27;ll find a million resources at your disposal.<p>form.length.$error.float is checking if an error exists for the validation rule float. Given the limited amount of code in the sample, we&#x27;d have to arbitrarily assume that the &quot;smart-float&quot; directive is implicitly setting a custom validation rule via:<p><pre><code>    ngModel.$setValidity(&#x27;float&#x27;)\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ll have to agree to disagree regarding pattern usage and dependency injection. They do have a place, and it tends to be in larger applications which become a burden to maintain as your application grows. To be quite honest, I believe angular brought a simplicity to DI that has yet to be seen in many other frameworks. It entirely lowered the barrier to entry for writing testable code and heavily promoted unit testing at the same time.",1395142362

Rails shines most when you do things as intended.<p>Even though I wouldn&#x27;t have designed rails the way it is (remote forms and .js.erb views anyone?), it works really well for a large class of applications.<p>Of course you may eventually hit a wall, but that happens when software outgrows it&#x27;s original requirements. That doesn&#x27;t mean you have to build a system for millions of concurrent users from day one. Especially not, when you&#x27;re making accounting software or a crm or some other run-off-the-mill webapp.<p>In my experience, rails &quot;improvements&quot; are often suggested, when a developer is faced with a large mudball of a rails application that doesn&#x27;t do things according to convention. This can quickly happen, because rails is deceptively easy to learn. Many developers I know (myself included), started writing a serious app in Rails, without learning a lot about it. Heck, if you&#x27;re a rails developer and honest with yourself, you probably didn&#x27;t even read all of the rails guides. In addition to that, I recommend reading a book such as &quot;The Rails Way&quot; front to cover, joining the mailing list, following the core team&#x27;s blogs and potentially even going through the code. I also DON&#x27;T recommend taking your patterns from random blog posts or stack overflow. Rails is very well documented and you can generally find what you need in the docs.<p>As infuriatingly dismissive as his tone sometimes is, I&#x27;ve actually found it best to follow dhh&#x27;s advice.

7421213,comment,7419553,7419553,5,0,moron4hire,,,"For Rust, this is good. I&#x27;m sure this is very good for Rust.<p>Take the rest of my message with a grain of salt. It&#x27;s 6:30am and I&#x27;m working through my first cup of coffee still. I&#x27;m not intentionally trying to be a grumpy old man.<p>For the rest of us, I&#x27;m concerned that yet-another-package-manager (YAPM? Yap-meager?) will just continue to fracture the library ecosystem.<p>Why can&#x27;t something like APT handle it? NPM doesn&#x27;t work the same as PIP, doesn&#x27;t work the same as Nuget, doesn&#x27;t work the same as Gem, other than the most basic install functionality. Packaging libraries for distribution is different for each, and if you have a problem, tearing into the system to figure out where the failure occurred is different for each.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s because, through hard-fought experience, I&#x27;ve finally learned how to manage .NET dependencies without too much headache. Don&#x27;t ever even think of trying to use the GAC. Don&#x27;t let your developers install the dependencies on their own. Just make a directory full of DLLs in your project root and use relative paths to load them. It&#x27;s the only way I&#x27;ve been able to get developers up and running with a project in Visual Studio as soon as they clone the repository. Even Nuget gave me issues (though granted, I gave up on it so fast I don&#x27;t remember what they were, other than telling the jr. dev to just dump the DLL in the libs directory already and get to work on the issue list).<p>Attempting to isolate your library ecosystem from the file system feels like it encourages &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot; at the language level for libraries that will mostly be the same across platforms. Do we really need to figure out how to do database connections in yet another language? Why are there 15 different syntaxes for positional arguments in strings?<p>I&#x27;m just getting a little... weary... of starting to learn a new programming and spending the next few hours just figuring out that they&#x27;ve renamed printf to writeln and %s to {0} for no good reason, or that there are no database connectors yet, or if there are they only implement a strange subset of databases. It almost feels like language devs have gone out of their way to be superficially different from everyone else, without being substantially different.<p>Given that most languages have support for some kind of foreign function interface, especially with the C ABI, it seems like we have the tools available to us to start building cross-platform libraries and distribute them regardless of consuming language.<p>I&#x27;ve been wanting to dabble in Rust for a little while, but damn, yet another package manager to learn, yet another notion of what a library ecosystem should look like, just doesn&#x27;t excite me right now. It&#x27;s time I will have to spend to get in the door, and I am not even sure right now if I will want to stick around.<p>But I suppose with an initiative like Rust, isolation is probably the correct ideology, considering it&#x27;s about security/performance before productivity.<p>Anyway, complaining done. No hate for Rust-team&#x27;s work. Just kind of yearning for a probably unobtainable utopian future :/",1395140631

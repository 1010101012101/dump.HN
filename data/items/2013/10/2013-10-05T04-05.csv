6499464,comment,6489135,6496788,1,0,pdonis,,,"<i>Why did the share prices go from the 10s of % to 95% or more?</i><p>Because people were buying the shares: supply and demand. And of course they were buying them because the general opinion on McCain&#x27;s chances was changing. I&#x27;m not disputing that.<p><i>Because I correctly forecast everything important about the bet: that McCain had a much higher chance of winning the nomination than everyone else did, and the market was wrong.</i><p>Yes: you basically did the same thing investors do when they believe a stock is undervalued. I&#x27;m not disputing that either.<p><i>Why does it matter that at some point I closed out my contract?</i><p>Because you were <i>able</i> to close it out for <i>any</i> reason at all other than the actual outcome on which the bet was based. The claim to which I originally responded in this subthread (which wasn&#x27;t made by you, btw) was this: &quot;You win a bet if you get the result right, e.g. You predict the result of an event. You don&#x27;t win by guessing the beliefs of others. Sure, you can trade in and out of a market as opinion changes, but you are still betting on a result and not an opinion.&quot;<p>Strictly speaking, this is <i>only</i> true if bets (or shares, or whatever you want to call them) cannot be traded. If bets can be traded, then other possible strategies open up that are not possible if bets cannot be traded. You played one such strategy: you correctly predicted that a certain bet (on McCain winning the nomination) was undervalued, so you bought it and waited for the price to go up. When the price had risen enough that the extra gain from continuing to hold the bet was less, to you, than the risk of him keeling over (i.e., less than the benefit to you of risk aversion), you sold your bet.<p>Such a strategy is not possible if bets cannot be traded. Suppose trading of bets had not been allowed in your case; you would have had to make your original bet knowing that you could <i>not</i> sell it, but would have to hold it until the actual outcome--i.e., you would not have the opportunity to lay off the risk. That would have changed the expected benefit to you from the transaction. (Whether it would have made a difference in what you actually did, I can&#x27;t say; but it certainly would have changed at least some of the factors on which you based your decision.)<p>It is quite true that you chose to play this strategy based on your (correct) prediction about the outcome, that McCain would get the nomination. But that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that the strategy itself, the one you actually played, depended on their being other players in the market to whom you could sell the bet when your desire for risk aversion became large enough. In other words, it depended on trading of bets being allowed, <i>and</i> on other players having different valuations of the shares than you did, so that you could find someone to trade with. So even if you &quot;won&quot; in the sense of correctly predicting the outcome, and realizing a payoff based on that prediction, the opinions of other players in the market still made a difference. That&#x27;s what I was trying to emphasize.<p><i>it doesn&#x27;t have to be differing estimates. It could also be risk aversion, liquidity constraints, noise, or a bunch of other things.</i><p>Technically, yes, there are two general kinds of reasons: differing estimates, and differing values. But in practice they basically amount to the same thing: your expected benefit from various possible courses of action is different from someone else&#x27;s. That&#x27;s the key thing that makes things like trading bets possible at all (that and whether or not the particular market in question allows trading bets to begin with).",1380948895

6499462,comment,6499230,6499364,3,0,gizmo686,,,">Limiting the commerce clause, and strengthening private property rights<p>For context, the commerce clause has been interpreted very broadly. The clause itself reads, &quot;To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;&quot;<p>One of the classic examples of the broad interperatation of this clause is Wickard v. Filburn [1]. There was a quota on how much wheat a farmer could produce, and Filburn exceeded his quota. The constitutional justification for this law is that wheat is interstate commerce. Filburn&#x27;s defence was that he was not selling the wheat at all, let alone across state lines, but rather using it himself to feed his livestock. Filburn lost in the Supreme Court because it causes an indirect effect to interstate commerce in the sense that Filburn would have purchased wheat if he did not grow it himself.<p>Not that it is directly relevant, but another fun example of loose interpretations of the constitution is roe v wade, where they managed to invoke the 3rd amendment to defend a woman&#x27;s right to an abortion. If you are not familiar with the third amendment, don&#x27;t worry; my constitutional law teacher took a moment to apologize when we got to this part because earlier in the coarse he had assured us that the 3rd amendment would never come up. It reads:<p><pre><code>  No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.

If you throw a coin 100 million times and 1 time it lands on its side - then you can have a rather reasonable estimate on how rare that possibility is even though you have just 1 occurrence.

Gasoline cars have a mean of 0.05 fires per million miles, and given the current Tesla data, the mean is 0.01 fires per million miles. I&#x27;m not taking out a calculator, but it would come out to an extremely low (0.0001%) the &#x27;true&#x27; fire chance is the 0.05 gas car rate or higher; the 95% confidence interval should be 0.01 +- 0.02 or tighter, so still twice better than gas cars.<p>For an exaggerated example, if Tesla had driven a billion miles and had 0 fires, you shouldn&#x27;t say that there&#x27;s not enough data - you definitely would have enough data to say that the chance of fire is below the gas-car rate of 5 fires per 100 million miles.",1380948631

Really good. Get good ts as many things as you can. Being good at one thing makes it easier to get good at other things.<p>2. Getting good at stuff takes practice.
Lots and lots of practice.<p>3. Get OBSESSED
Everyone at the top of their field is obsessed with what they&#x27;re doing.<p>4. Doing something well and thoroughly is it&#x27;s OWN reward.<p>5. Show and Tell
If you do something well and you&#x27;re happy with it, for FSM&#x27;s
sake, tell EVERYONE<p>6. IF YOU WANT SOMETHING, ASK.
If something piques your interest, tell someone, if you want to learn something, ask someone, like your BOSS. As an employer I can tell you, people who want to learn new skills are people I want to keep employed.<p>7. Have GOALS
Make up goals. Set goals. Regularly assess where you are and where you want to be in terms of them. This is a kind of prayer that works, and works well. Allow for the fact that things will NEVER turn out like you think they will, and you must be prepared to end up miles from where you intended.<p>8. BE NICE
TO EVERYONE. Life is way to short to be an asshole. If you are an asshole, apologize.<p>9. Fail
You will fail. It&#x27;s one of our jobs in life. Keep failing. When you fail, admit it. When you don&#x27;t, don&#x27;t get cocky, &#x27;Cause you&#x27;re just about to fail again.<p>10. WORK YOUR ASS OFF

The best startups define their own space - Hubspot being a great example with their early definition of inbound marketing which is now standard part of our lexicon.<p>PR is most definitely not something that startups just do when they mess up - PR, done correctly, works by extending you name (and space) out to the world. It&#x27;s also easy to look at the success of a company and not recognize that there was likely a coordinated, deliberate PR strategy behind it that resulted in dozens of article that promote the brand.<p>All that being said, I agree with the core argument of the article - namely that spending a lot of money, early on, on an external PR agency is likely to be a waste of money.  I would add, however, that if you can align your product with a PR agency or person that has actual relationships with press in the area the start up works in, then you can get value.<p>The biggest mistake I see is when a startup hires a PR agency because they are a big name, but lack the fundamental relationships with the press you care about.  At the end of the day, the value the PR agency brings is those relationships - so if you are going to hire someone, find a specialist in your field rather than a big-name generalist who will get you in Techcrunch but miss your core audience of actual prospects.",1380945628

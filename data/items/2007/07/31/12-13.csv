And any company, no matter how much of an outsider they are at first, eventually becomes corrupted and also evil (see: Sprint as one example).  <p>Google would have to specifically and repeatedly and publicly repudiate the status quo of telco behavior in order to have even a chance of avoiding the same fate, should they get into telco-like services.",1185886312

It's about not having someone to pick you up when you're discouraged, multiply your enthusiasm, and turn you back around when you've fallen in love with a bad idea.<p>Either that, or it's just that misery loves company. ;-)",1185885136
37903,comment,37881,37881,0,0,staunch,,,"What pmarca is ignoring is that most people won't even try to come up with ideas by themselves. It's pretty tough to spend  hours by yourself brainstorming on one topic. When you have someone (even a manikin) as resistance it can really draw out your best ideas. Nothing makes me come up with a clever idea quicker than someone suggesting that there's no solution to a problem. The real world difference between brainstorming as a group and as an individual might be the difference between some and zero.<p>\n<i>What these groups of co-founders do together is more complicated than just sitting down and trying to think of ideas. I suspect the most productive setup is a kind of together-alone-together sandwich. Together you talk about some hard problem, probably getting nowhere. Then, the next morning, one of you has an idea in the shower about how to solve it. He runs eagerly to to tell the others, and together they work out the kinks.</i> -- Ideas for Startups\n",1185884984

That's why I created this startup-focused search engine.<p>\nIt currently is limited to search for startup related news/forums on News Ycombinator, Techcrunch, Startupping, Mashable, Venturebeat and most read blogs from Paul graham, Robert Scoble, Guy Kawasaki, Don Dodge and a lot of other sites (currently ~80 in total).<p>Feedbacks are appreciated.",1185884959

37898,comment,37720,37887,0,0,cpinto,,,"No, not really. Possibly this depends on where you are at but here in Portugal (where I am), I can get a better physical server for about 80Eur/month, which is only a bit more for what I would pay for an EC2 instance (including network traffic). Is it worth the extra dollars? I think so. <p>Also, even though S3 doubles as a backup medium (and you _must_ backup your database), if you want a database running on EC2 you _must_ go for S3 to store your information. That too will increase your costs. <p>And on top of all that, you have to spend some time tweaking and testing your configuration (and testing again).  If you're short on working hands, the time you spend on this activity may not be worth it. <p>I think that, unless you're doing it just for fun, you should let someone else help Amazon sort out the kinks of their system. <p>In the end, having your entire system on EC2 will not give you an edge over your competition, but the time you save by not doing it probably will.\n",1185884184

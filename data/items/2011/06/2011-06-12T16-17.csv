Online learning and other forms of distance education can allow bright learners in underperforming schools to take supplemental classes in mathematics (a huge market for online courses), computer programming, English vocabulary, and even more interactive subjects such as humanities and lab sciences. That lets young learners learn more faster.

Until the rise of e.g. finance and actuarial science, getting a physics or math degree meant just going into academia. Now, with more demand for math or physics majors, there will be more demand for physics or math professors, which ultimately means more money going into math and physics research.<p>The existence of the medical and legal professions contributes vastly to the funding of schools of medicine and law, and this is no different.

2646787,comment,2646001,2646727,4,0,hugh3,,,"The conformity of the geeky echo-chamber on the subject of copyright law worries me. The trouble with echo chambers is not just that extreme opinions (e.g. that media piracy is okay and all intellectual property law should be abolished) start to seem mainstream to those inside them, but that the folks who want to have extreme opinions then have to adopt even <i>more</i> extreme opinions.<p>Here, for instance, we have the opinion that not only is media piracy okay, but that any government attempt to stop it is not merely as bad as but <i>worse</i> than, say, the Chinese Government's ongoing attempts to censor anyone who dares to say ""Hey, the Chinese Government kinda sucks"".<p>I don't think existing IP law is ideal, by any means, nor do I think that it's what <i>I</i> think it should be (and I'm not so arrogant to assume that what I think the law should be and what the law <i>really</i> should be are the same thing, since copyright law is intrinsically a compromise between different types of people, and there's certainly no reason why my personal preferences should take precedence over anyone else's). And I'm happy to engage and argue with people who have extreme opinions, but the correct way to express an extreme opinion starts off with an acknowledgement ""OK, this might sound crazy but hear me out..."" rather than a bald-faced assertion that ""wah wah, enforcing copyright law is like shovelling babies into gas chambers"" or whatever.",1307897306

2646778,comment,2646485,2646485,30,0,peteretep,,,"It's interesting what you can do with a questionnaire...<p>Back in the day (a few years ago) I worked as a full-time dating coach. As you can imagine, there was always a credibility gap for potential clients, and one way we'd try and mitigate that was to offer (and to absolutely honour) a complete money-back guarantee - if you didn't get $3,000 worth of value out of your weekend, you could have your money back, just by asking for it.<p>As a coach, with the way the business model set up, even one customer asking for their money back was a financial disaster - there were lots of sunk costs in terms of accommodation and flights.<p>Anyway, through sensible use of a questionnaire, I got my personal refund rate down to literally 0. None of my 600 students (over the timeframe I ran workshops) asked for their money back, and I attribute it to the questionnaire (and our being awesome dating coaches ;-))<p>The workshops were split in to 5 hours of seminar on each of Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and 4 hours ""in the field"" on Friday and Saturday nights. We had to maintain a 3:1 student to instructor ratio, and could sell up to 12 places on the weekend. As a Lead Coach, I was responsible for all of it (and had laid out the cash from my pocket for all of it, too).<p>On both Saturday and Sunday morning, I'd give the students a questionnaire, although Saturday was by far the more important of the two. I'd start by asking them general questions, phrased to get them thinking about the positives:<p>* What's been your favourite aspect so far?
* What's been your key learning point so far?
* How many girls did you talk to last night?
* Describe the best interaction you had last night...
* What are you going to try and do differently tonight? (on the Saturday)<p>As Tony Robbins says, the quality of your life is determined by the questions you ask yourself. Students will typically have had a LOT of great experiences, but also a few blow-outs, and a few low points in the evening. What I wanted to do was to focus them on the best aspects of what they'd learned.<p>Our big worry was always that we'd get someone who'd come along, enjoy the program, and then ask for their money back right at the end because they were cheap. Now technically they weren't allowed to do this - the money-back guarantee stipulated that they had to tell us and give us time to fix anything they weren't enjoying.<p>So to me, the crucial questions were then:<p>* Which coach did you work with?
* Would you be happy to work with them again tonight? (on the Saturday)<p>Now the coaches were great guys, and what's more, would all go the extra mile for students. Students would run, hide, tell coaches they didn't want to do it anymore, etc, but the coaches would stick with the guys and MAKE them talk to girls. And the students LOVED them for it. By capturing the student's enthusiasm for the coaches in writing, I got two things:<p>Firstly there was an implicit agreement that they were having a good time. And that was good, as long as the student /was/ having a good time. But also it gave us time to spot any problems WELL in advance. Every workshop, one guy out of 12 would have had a not-great time on the first night. Some students and instructors just did not get along, some guys had some really deep-set problems, and needed one-on-one love-bombing.<p>Without the questionnaires (and at first, I was the only Lead Coach using them), these were the guys who asked for refunds. By getting them to answer questionnaires early in to the process, we were able to identify them and take corrective action...<p>Anyway! That's quite a wall of text, so:<p>tl;dr: you can use questionnaires to change the way people think about things, and also to catch problems well before they happen...",1307897115

Linus does a great job of being that voice for the kernel and the closest we come for user land is Canonical. An illustrative example of how that voice might feel to users, if you have a choice between Gnome (MacOS X inspired UI) or KDE (Windows inspired UI) then the set of utilities (calculator, IM client, explorer, etc) might (in a well voiced world) have one implementation and they would change their behavior depending on window system preference.  Some do of course, but many don't and it confuses new users when they use the KDE version of a tool on Gnome or vice versa. The concept is that you need one person or group which is speaking toward how things will be done, so that consistency can be achieved across a large number of things. The concept seems somewhat antithetical to some members of the Linux and FOSS communities.<p>Another area where a good leader / communicator would help out would be in things like audio and printing and wireless networks. These things are, to the perspective of someone coming to or trying Linux, horribly horribly broken. They ""just work"" on Windows or MacOS.<p>Graphics and windows have gotten better in recent years but anything that drops into the 'modify your .Xdefaults file' or 'Xorg configuration' just mortifies someone who just wants to use the machine they don't want to become a 'nerd' just to do something useful.<p>The 'edges' of Linux, especially in places where there are on-going personality of philosophical wars (like the Canonical/Gnome/KDE wars or the Wireless vendors vs the world wars) are really yucky places to have a problem.<p>And there is the point that was made in the article that when you do have a problem you can't really find an answer sometimes. I wish there was the 'redhat for desktop' equivalent one could point those people at. Canonical is closer but having a staff that manages issues rather than a wiki/forums page would make it worth paying for in some circles.",1307896961

How could you have experinece with it if you hadn't worked in Windows before?<p>Also, the coding here (very possibly in WPF) isn't in Windows itself, its about using WPF to create UX for test tools and test automation.",1307894719

But for your issue, I would take a piece of paper, write down your old habits, then to the very right of them, right down the NEW habits that you wish to overwrite the old habits that you have now. Don't give into your old habits, replace them with new ones.<p>Then, only focus on the new habits. Don't think back to the past of your old habits. Even more than that, just focus on PRACTICING these new habits. By doing this, you will reinforce your new habits until you essentially forget how to perform those old ones.<p>In sports, good coaches fix problems with technique (since all of it is habitual motions) by telling their students to do something NEW. They don't tell them to fix this or that. Telling their student to do something new is more constructive than trying to tell them to fix something that already has some flaws to it.<p>Good luck!",1307894643

People are not idiots to be just blinded by Google's logo; Google is a teenager now, and the hype has worn off, IMHO.<p>Given _any_ language, I can find some non-empty problem set where that language performs badly (or is ill-suited). That does not take anything away from the language. There is no ""perfect"" language yet; maybe we'll get one in 5 years...

I'm as big of a Steve Jobs fanboy as there ever was (seriously!), but he is <i>much</i> smarter/wiser today in some significant aspects than he was 30 years ago.<p>Apple today is really, really good about not ending up hamstrung because they didn't have a Plan B; part of why they control everything so tightly and don't make themselves dependent on other organizations is because they want to avoid ever being in a position where they're ""stuck"". If these guys hadn't surreptitiously worked with Sony, the Mac would have been wounded, perhaps critically.<p>It's good that Steve admitted he was wrong, and he'll go down as one of the absolute greate leaders in business history, but this story doesn't generally strike me as an example of great leadership.",1307894551

You see either mercury gets pulled to the location the sun IS, or it gets pulled to the location the sun WAS. In the latter case you will see an oscillation. We checked, and the predicted oscillation was there.<p>Funny thing is that that oscillation will get bigger the closer 2 objects are together, and this makes very low orbits possible around very heavy objects, and several such orbits have been confirmed to exist.",1307894532

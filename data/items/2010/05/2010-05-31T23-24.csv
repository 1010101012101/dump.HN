1393841,comment,1393669,1393669,0,0,jschuur,,,"Let's just focus on one thing that many people are used to: the news feed.<p>Say I want to find out what all my friends are up to lately. Since this information doesn't live in a (more or less) central place any more like it used to on Facebook, I need to go out and contact each node (in an encrypted, secure way) that my friends run/pay to host on an ISP and ask them, what they're up to lately. That information then gets merged by my local node (that I presumably access to view a news stream) and displayed to me.<p>Isn't that more than a bit inefficient? Hundreds of friends, means hundreds of connections going out, to grab friend updates, each with encryption overhead. And all those nodes have to be up and running of course.<p>OK, so let's assume your own node is smart enough to cache these updates. Maybe it even gets updates pushed to it when my friends update, so it's not constantly polling all of them in search for updates. That means if my friend withdraws permission to see their updates, I still have access to their cached info local to my own node.<p>So perhaps there's also a push update system that handles revocation. You remove permissions and send another message to those affected to forget your info. But what if I run a modified node that chooses to ignore this information? The whole thing is open source and anyone can tinker with their node code. Say I friend a malicious entity, decide I don't like them anymore, and take back their access. It could be too late.<p>See, this is the kind of technical detail I was hoping for. Real life examples and a vague outline of how they're going to tackle them.",1275350129

It's certainly not enough for them to hire anyone else full time to join them.  Yes, they didn't have to do much to get this money and I realize it's infuriating if you're really struggling to get your business off the ground when 4 nobodies get a chunk of money out of nowhere, but please recognize that the amount is so small that it doesn't warrant outrage.<p>Furthermore, they didn't even ask for that much. It got a big network effect in light of the recent facebook privacy issues, but it's a one time thing and most likely the last money they'll ever see for this project. I don't think their situation is repeatable in any sort of predictable way, so it probably doesn't warrant studying (please correct me if someone's figured out a way to do this, cause I think most of us would like to figure out how to get free funding). We should wish them the best of luck and only care when they make something people want to use.<p>I can already see the headlines of outrage when they don't produce something that destroys facebook overnight, or maybe don't release on time, or their code is really bad.

That part is easy.  So, I have a Diaspora account with ""Awesomea"" and you have a Diaspora account with ""Crapula"".  It's easy to have communications between Awesomea and Crapula be secure.  However, when you visit your Crapula page, you want to see my updates which means that Crapula needs to be able to decrypt my updates.  Even if you have a different key for each user (ala public key encryption), for wide adoption the service providers (in this case, Awesomea and Crapula) need to be able to encrypt and decrypt that information (which means they hold the keys).<p>So, if I friend you and you're using Crapula, I need to trust both you and Crapula that you won't do bad things with my data.<p>Part of this is that the Diaspora project doesn't seem to have any technical information.  They have lofty goals like, ""you own your social graph, you have access to your information however you want, whenever you want, and you have full control of your online identity.""  However, they have scant information on how they plan to accomplish that.  They say they're using GPG, but are they going to have a browser plugin with locally stored keys to decrypt the information?  That's the only way I can see this being secure.  If you're storing your key with Crapula and it's decrypting my information, it can store is as well as show it to you.<p>Even if the design is to use locally stored keys, what's to stop a provider from offering a ""better"" (better, in this case, means easier for non-tech-inclined users) Diaspora-compatible server which stores them on the server?  And then I have to audit my friend requests to see how their server has set up security?<p>It's kinda like handing a friend a classified document and a photocopier.  You tell them ""please don't copy this"" and they probably won't.  But in this case you're handing that classified document to Crapula and saying ""pass this along to my friend and don't copy it along the way"".  Yes, Facebook has that ability too, but it's one company that has a reputation to defend (to an extent) as well as a legal presence in the United States (which is good for me as a US citizen) and by posting in the first place I'm trusting them with that data.  With Diaspora, I could start getting friend requests from all sorts of services run by people a lot shadier than the Facebook folk and I now have to deal with dozens of privacy policies rather than one.<p>BTW, this is probably the comment that I would most like to be proved wrong on.  I want distributed, secure social networking that puts me in control of my data.  It's just that I don't see how it works and the Diaspora website doesn't have any information on it either.  If someone here knows how this will work, I'd love it!  It's an exciting prospect, but I feel like it's the same as DRM: if people can read it/see it/hear it, it can be copied.  Likewise, if a service provider is printing it on screen for one of their users, they can store it.  If anyone has technical information on how this works, it would be really awesome!",1275347152

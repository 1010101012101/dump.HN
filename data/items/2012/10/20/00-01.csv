It's basically a game of chicken with your data. What happens when your power goes out for longer than you can provide backup supply to? You lose all your data that was on the DDR3.<p>The basic way that they deal with that is to use a two phase system. Lots of DDR3 and servers running a caching layer on them(memcached, etc...). You can buffer your writes in ram as well but that as always is a tradeoff.",1350694794

4675868,comment,4674270,4675657,7,0,Xcelerate,,,"""Mass"" is an overloaded word.  Nowadays, when physicists refer to a particle's mass, they are referring to what may more specifically be called its ""rest-mass"" or ""invariant-mass"".  This is a property fundamental to the particle, much as how charge or spin is.  This value never changes, and it is associated with a certain amount of energy (E=mc^2).<p>""Relativistic-mass"" is the other use of ""mass"", although I prefer to just use the word ""energy"".  As a particle's velocity increases, its relativistic-mass / energy increases as well, but its rest-mass does NOT.  So you take mc^2 + the kinetic energy of the particle, and that gives you the total energy of the particle.<p>The gravitational force is a function of total <i>energy</i> [1].  This is why gravity bends the trajectories of photons (and other bosons) even though these particles have no rest-mass.  The gravitational force between two systems is a function of the total energy of each system regardless of whatever kind of stuff makes up the system.<p>For an example, consider the earth + moon system.  If you were to ""weigh"" this system, and then weigh the earth and moon separately, you would find that the sum of the individual weights is more than the sum of the two body system.  This is because of the binding energy between the earth and the moon (which is negative).  It is interesting to note that this potential energy is roughly equivalent to the mass of everyone on earth.<p>[1] Gravity is really unique in this regard.  No other force is like it.",1350691407

I predict this will be the year of the Open Startup and it's foundup. We running a closed alpha development trial and launching public beta on 12.12.12. What's so great about the open startup? It doesn't need the 1% to succeed and they launch as Open Corp and new selfless framework in which 20-80% of net profits are invested into lannching more   open corps. My prediction is this...<p>1) Closed incubators such as this one and other clones will be displaced by a highly scaleable open free solution that offers a solution where 1% are not needed.
2) Closed crowdfunding funding platforms like profounder, KS, IGG, etc will be disrupted by our free version that offers TWO new ways to raise funds, 1) has raised over $1.6bn  for npo strategic initiatives and another is my creation that I call passive crowdfunding.
3) Developers will be marginalized to becoming construction workers.

3395442,comment,3395057,3395057,1,0,Mz,,,"Reminds me of some other condition, I don't recall the name.  I want to say ""night terrors"".  My oldest had serious sleep issues when he was little.  So I checked some book out of the library to try to get a handle on it.  Most of it was drivel, like ""god, I can't believe you thought someone would need that told to them"". But it did have one piece of information in it that was useful, and that was about my oldest son occasionally getting up all upset after sleeping for roughly an hour.  I eventually realized he only did this when physically exhausted but not mentally exhausted.  So he would fall asleep but his mind was still racing. After an hour, he would sit up basically screaming, due to very vivid mental stuff going on.  The book indicated he probably wasn't really awake at such times, but was reacting while asleep.  I learned to not let him get so physically exhausted and it went away.  The problem never returned.<p>I think it would be neat if someone who has EHS kept a diary/journal and tried to determine if there was some pattern, some trigger event or whatever, for them personally (my assumption being that triggers would vary from person to person but enough such data might yield some generalizations anyway).  It sounds like it may be an auditory version of the visual stuff my son experienced.",1324984806

But sometimes it's more like a gunshot, a tearing sheet of paper, or an indecipherable vocal shout.<p>The sound does not feel dreamlike at all (like sounds you imagine while in a hypnagogic state.) I can imagine a first-timer might mistake it for an external event and rising in shock to look for the source of the disturbance.<p>The sound is of short duration (about 0.2s) and is loudest at the end of the sound, cutting off sharply into total silence (""...wwwWWWHOMP!"") It's very loud, but not painful like a real report in a quiet room would be. The loudness feels like 120 dB or so. The sound is absolutely ""pure,"" missing environmental cues like position, echo, and pressure. I perceive the location to be smack-dab in the middle of my head, not anywhere outside my physical body (a bit like headphones.) Because of this, and because I have been cued to the impending sound (see below), there is no danger of mistaking it for something real.<p>The chronology when my head goes boom:<p>T minus 30 seconds: I'm in bed, eyes closed. It always happens before or at the beginning of hypnagogia.<p>T minus 10 seconds: I get a feeling somewhat akin to a sudden pressure drop in my ears (but without any popping or physical symptoms). This is a cue that tells me to expect an explosion.<p>T: The pseudo-aural pressure cue suddenly ends by ""transforming"" into a short, explosive sound. Heart rate starts to rise rapidly. My eyes remain closed and my musculoskeletal system usually don't react, as the sound doesn't scare or surprise me.<p>T plus 5 seconds: Heart is beating as fast as it can go. At this point it feels almost exactly like right after snapping awake from a night terror, but without the fear component.<p>T plus 60 seconds: Heart rate begins to decline to normal levels.",1324983976

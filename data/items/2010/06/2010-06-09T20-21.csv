1418269,comment,1417396,1418153,0,0,anamax,,,"> So implement storage. Build more capacity than you need for momentary power and use the excess to charge batteries or raise water columns. Build still more excess capacity, charge local storage at the solar plant or at intermediate locations, and use the rest of the excess at the point of consumption to charge storage there.<p>You're assuming that that's economically viable.  If it is, why aren't you going all-in with your money?<p>> That's a lot of solar generators. So the sooner we start, the sooner we'll get there.<p>Nope.  We'll end up with a lot of old-tech solar that isn't as good as what we'll get by waiting.<p>> If we can only make it through part of the night before lighting up an oil generator, it's still a win.<p>Only if you ignore costs.<p>Spending $100 today on a solar system that is half as cost-effective as one that becomes available in 2 years is a good idea in some circumstances but not all.  That's relevant because solar systems are not static.<p>> increasingly available energy will drive the cost of existing energy down<p>That's not necessarily true.  It depends on costs.  For example, we can get energy by burning diamonds.  However, doing so will not drive the cost of existing energy down.",1276117155

1418227,comment,1416808,1417679,0,0,Kuiper,,,"When Steam first came out, people didn't just hate the <i>idea</i> of Steam constricting their games, they hated the actual implementation of the client.  The client was bloated and unstable, and the Counter-Strike community in particular was upset by the fact that Steam was being forced on them even though it didn't confer any significant advantages over WON. During the first week, people had authentication issues with the client not allowing them to play games that had previously worked fine. At one point, someone cracked the exe to not use Steam and the result was better game performance, which was further evidence of how poorly the client was implemented.<p>The main thing that people like about the Steam client now, as you mentioned, are the client's community support features.  People also like the Steam store's frequent discounts. Steam community integration didn't exist until late 2007, and 2007 was also the first year that they did a major holiday sale. Before that point, most people were either neutral on the system, or disliked it because the client was a waste of resources. Its memory footprint was big enough to make a significant performance impact on older machines, which is significant when you consider that Counter-Strike, the most popular game on Steam at that point, was a game from 1999.<p>People eventually came to like Steam, but that wasn't until Steam began functioning as a service that added value to a product, rather than an impediment that devalued a product.  The Battle.net 2.0 is plagued with many of the problems of the original Steam client, and it confers very few of the benefits that the present-day Steam does.  People don't just hate the <i>idea</i> of it, they hate the very client itself and will continue hating it until Blizzard does something to fix it.  Forcing it on the playerbase when it is still in its current unpolished state is making a lot of people very upset, and reasonably so.",1276116396

You make it. If you discover you made a typo or overlooked some issue and thus it has caused a bug, during your dev-testing, you fix it. Once the desired change is done, working as intended, with no bugs, that change-sprint is done and commited to your VCS. Then you end the dev session or advance to the next desired change. The key is that when your dev session ends, and when you are just wearing the user's hat, there should be no bugs. In my experience, bugs can be found usually quickly and easily within the same coding session that introduced a new feature, while the code and your recent change are all fresh in mind, and you are in The Zone.<p>That was a good heuristic you suggested, but I think it applies to situations where a bug survives beyond the end of a development session, accidentally.",1276116311

What I take away from it is that Stallman's full opinion on SaaS is internally inconsistent, either that or I am completely misunderstanding him. The ""Distinguishing SaaS from Other Network Services"" section was exceptionally incoherent; here's one quote:<p>> Multiplayer games are a group activity carried out on someone else's server, which makes them SaaS. But where the data involved is just the state of play and the score, the worst wrong the operator might commit is favoritism. You might well ignore that risk, since it seems unlikely and very little is at stake. On the other hand, when the game becomes more than just a game, the issue changes.<p>So, SaaS is okay so long as the ""risks"" are sufficiently small? Who defines that risk, me? So that makes it okay for me to use Google Docs, since I deem the risk of Google doing something evil with my documents to be small? (Well, no, because Stallman explicitly calls out Docs as unacceptable. So I guess I better not use that.)<p>Or from the conclusion:<p>> Don't buy or install “thin clients”, which are simply computers so weak they make you do the real work on a server, unless you're going to use them with <i>your</i> server.<p>...thus violating the ""essential freedoms"" of anyone who uses your thin clients?<p>This is (one of the reasons) why it's so hard to take Stallman and his ""four essential freedoms"" seriously.",1276115214

Smarter people than me who have spent more of their lives on this problem have optimized the universe of acceptable ciphers for speed already.

There is a much wider selection in the number of video games they can choose to play.<p>So you have two forces working against you. First, if you raise your prices, there are a lot of other games people can play. Second, if you raise your prices, people can simply choose not to play at all.<p>Not so with audio engineers. They must have the software to make a living, giving them a lot less choice in the matter. They also probably become more intimately familiar with the software than most gamers become with video games. Finally, the context encourages a level of maturity that recognizes the impact of freeloading and fosters good-customership.<p>So, that's why you probably won't be able to charge more for a video game. Although they do get away with it in some contexts (rock band, some racing games).<p>P.S. as much as you would like to believe gamers will pay for quality wherever they find it, there's also this issue that in your industry (apparently roguelike games) there's this huge norming influence toward free-to-play games.

As you mention DES and 3DES, known to be very vulnerable today, you are implying that you know of security issues with the Blowfish cipher, so, please enlighten us - what is that all of the cryptographers in the world except you have completely missed regarding cryptanalysis and weaknesses of this cipher?<p>Please don't bring any performance claims up, because if you are really as familiar with Blowfish as you appear to imply, then you know very well that with a proper implementation (and there as many bad ones as good ones) it outperforms all of the AES ciphers by several times. Also don't bring up the ""incredibly slow"" key schedule as a valid point of ""why no one should ever use it"", because it's not really slow, even by yesterday's measures of computational power.<p>add.: I'll give you a few reasons of why the cipher is still interesting just for the sake of the discussion :)<p>1) same encryption time regardless key size - 448 bits of key perform just as fast as 8 bits.<p>2) very sophisticated s-box/key schedule - trying to brute force the cipher is practically impossible as the raw key is not used in the encryption/decryption process itself, and performing the s-box setup for every bit of possible key pushes the brute force process back a few orders of magnitude in speed, and, trying to brute force by traversing the p- and s-boxes, all 8768 bits worth, just ain't happening today.... or tomorrow.<p>3) performance - among the (so far) unbroken ciphers, it's quite possibly the fastest one.",1276114292

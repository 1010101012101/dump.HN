It seems to me that if an application has high performance demands and is expected to be in service for years, it should eventually be rewritten in a faster language. I find myself designing/developing programs in Python because development is so fast, then rewriting the result in a faster language after the design phase is over.<p>The rewriting phase is basically a translation, not a redesign. In most cases I know exactly how the program should behave, so there's no design taking place.",1353405577

4808399,comment,4804818,4806469,3,0,lloeki,,,"ssmoot says he invented this, which is eminently readable but feels like being too leaky (what's the name of the deprecated gem that does that to AR already?):<p><pre><code>    1) User.where(:age.gt => 5)
</code></pre>
ssmoot says this is better:<p><pre><code>    2) User.where { |user| user.age > 5 }
</code></pre>
SQLAlchemy does it this way:<p><pre><code>    3) query.filter(User.name == 'ed')
</code></pre>
which looks so much like how AR3.0 + ARel does it (and seriously AR::Base should delegate [] to arel_table):<p><pre><code>    4) User.where(User.arel_table[:age].gt 5)
</code></pre>
and here's squeel's way:<p><pre><code>    5) User.where{age >= 5}
</code></pre>
FTR, Django QuerySet does it by parsing kwargs (convention is double underscore => dot, which allows to 'call' methods on fields (pub_date__year) and joined relations (group__name)):<p><pre><code>    6) User.objects.filter(age__gt=5)
</code></pre>
From a 'user' (i.e developer consuming the API) perspective I really like 1 and 5 because there is no redundancy (with which 2 is full of). Still when you're join()ing, you have to make ambiguous things explicit, and in that case 1 falls apart (you're not going to write :group_name, are you?), so while 5 is nice and allows for niceties like group.type, I am perfectly content with 4 because it's both stock Rails and quite readable, it's just that the full sized <i>User.arel_table</i> breaks the reading flow, and a bit redundant in the trivial case.<p>I'm not fond of stringifying stuff as resorting on parsing makes it less dynamic and more prone to abuse, and it we write strings we might as well write partial SQL.<p>Indeed ActiveSupport is a bad example because it extends by monkeypatching, but implements stuff that always apply (all strings are potentially camelizable, always, ever, and arguably integers can always be qualified with units) whereas Symbol#gt is nonsensical outside some specific scope.<p>The refinement situation is terrible because it performs poorly, leaks badly and makes things terribly inconsistent, especially with blocks passed around. I can't even begin to fathom the consequences of a block being called on an unexpected binding.",1353405322

4808385,comment,4806059,4806458,2,0,Lerc,,,"When hyperloop was first mentioned I considered the criteria required and worked on a matching result.  I came up with something that deviates from later info by nevertheless I came up with something that matched.<p>Working on the principle that the speeds and efficiency mentioned means it has to avoid the friction of travelling through a medium.  Since he had said ""not a vac tunnel""  I set my mind considering how the problem could be solved without relying on a vacuum.   I figured, 'why not move the medium as well?'.   Making a tube train travelling in a fluid medium would be interesting.  Make the inner surface of the tube a hydrophobic surface.  Use solar power along the length of the tube to accelerate the liquid.  The speed would increase until the energy lost through friction with the sides reached equilibrium of the solar acceleration.  If you can reduce the surface friction sufficiently, extremely high speeds should be possible.<p>Comparing against the checklist you did, a Hydrophobic torus full of high speed liquid gets a fair number of hits.  The same aspect applies of energy storage as kinetic.  It's a better match for 'ground based' but The same ground based aspect means it would get in the way.   Building the liquid filled thing would be much easier,  possibly implementable at smaller scales initially.<p>Mostly I think this just goes to show the interesting ideas you can come up with when given a set of constraints and a goal.  I seem to vaguely recall a Mike Abrash anecdote about VGA fifos that applies here too.<p>I think I'd be a bit disappointed if it is a Lofstrom loop(but that's what it likely is) unless there is some significant innovation extending the idea.  It's just like a vac tunnel with cool inertial skyhooks.",1353405060

The mathematical operation of expectation E is only a tool.

Thing is the organisations that perform thorough civilian demining already start off with cheaper methods such as mine rollers to get some of the mines, and the ones they use are arguably cheaper to use because they're strong enough to require fewer replacement parts. For instance Mechem has a CASSPIR armoured vehicle with steel wheels that'll happily trundle over anti-personnel mines all day without needing repairs (though anti-tank mines necessitate a wheel change).<p>And as another poster (codebeaker) pointed out, it's also far worse for demining teams to have random shrapnel spread over a minefield, as it makes the job of identifying mines much more difficult.

Given #1, it would follow that additional (expensive) land mine clearing technologies would always be needed in addition.  I don't know how these work or are billed out, but if the cost is per square mile or some similar area-based unit (instead of say, per mine), then clearing out 60% of the landmines first would not affect the supplemental cost.

4808334,comment,4808199,4808199,5,0,lifthrasiir,,,"Nice, but I should note that JITing does not improve performance greatly. Many basic arithmetic operations take O(n) or O(n^2) time, and as you cannot access arbitrary cells in the arbitrary order so most memory access operations also take at least O(n) time. There are handful optimizers that can optimize them provided that the program uses only a fixed amount of cells, but AFAIK there are <i>no</i> such optimizers in general.<p>If you plan to implement an optimization, I recommend a pointer propagation. This is very simple and still lots of optimizers ignore it. For example,<p><pre><code>    mem += 3;
    while (mem[0]) { mem += 1; mem[0] -= 1; mem += 1; }
    mem -= 4;
    mem[0] = 0;
</code></pre>
becomes:<p><pre><code>    while (mem[3]) { mem[1] -= 1; mem += 2; }
    mem[-1] = 0;
    mem -= 1; /* you can safely ignore this at the end of file */
</code></pre>

Then the summer after kindergarten my mom bought me a QBASIC book.  I had only recently learned to read so it had to be read aloud to me at first, but I understood it. I pretty much didn't get up from my terminal all summer.  By the time I started first grade I was comfortable with nested loops.  I still have a friend whom I met in fourth grade who started programming as early as I did, but in REXX.  I don't put much stock in Piaget :-)<p>It wasn't until around 1999, though, that I was really able to start becoming a hacker.  That was when I finally got my own computer rather than sharing one with the family, and immediately put Linux on it.",1191655289

This was around the time AOL 2.6 or 2.7 was current, and there were many ways to modify the AOL software to do very cool things.<p>After AOL released version 3 of the AOL client (which closed a lot of the hooks for illegal addons), I wrote what might be the world's first searchbox for web browsers. This was when I was a teenager and AltaVista was still the largest search engine. The program I wrote was a small AppleScript application that registered an ""av"" protocol with Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer so you could type ""av:knitting patterns"" in the Location bar and have that string sent to the AppleScript applet. The script received the string, looked for what came after the ""av:"" and computed a full URL to send it back to the web browser. The whole process was invisible to the user, as long as the AppleScript applet was running in the background.<p>It was a very simple script and I released it as shareware. I later built a search plugin architecture so users could add their favorite search engines, and the whole experience was a huge lesson in programming, testing, documentation, distribution, customer support and marketing, and I was suddenly buried in work.<p>Then Apple developed a plugin architecture for Sherlock and I started getting fewer and fewer shareware registrations. That's what essentially killed my shareware product, but the entire experience was very exciting. I was hooked and have been hacking ever since.",1191654962

The people who discriminate <i>disagree</i> about whether discrimination is a good or bad idea.<p>Disagreement should not be dealt with by force, it should be dealt with by persuasion, (and with competition). The only exception is when force would happen no matter what we do (ie, they want to assault or defraud someone, then force takes place whether we stop them or not).<p>When people want to peacefully do things we think are bad, like discriminate, or watch Desperate Housewives, or buy homeopathic medicine, the best thing to do is leave them alone. Do we really want the Government monitoring and judging our peaceful economic choices? The only thing at stake with discrimination is it prevents cooperation between certain people. But so what? I do not have a right to have others work with me; such things should be purely voluntary. And there are still plenty of better, non-discriminating people to work with.",1191654019

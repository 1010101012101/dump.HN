Absent rent control, the article plausibly claims equilibrium rent would be higher than the <i>rent controlled</i> rent but lower than the <i>market</i> rent, because &quot;market&quot; rent reflects the rent only on a very small share of the available housing.<p>But the situation is actually better than that because if we could convincingly get rid of rent control there would be a lot of new entry into the market, making the good less scarce.<p>Under tight rent control, landlords have an incentive to take apartments off the market and convert them into condos or luxury homes. Remove rent control and some of those apartments will come back, which grows the supply and drives down price. Under a true market where landlords can recoup development costs we should expect see an increase in both the supply and quality of available apartments compared to the current day.",1426560589

They&#x27;re not going to make a deal with a small &quot;outfit&quot; that doesn&#x27;t have national airport coverage.<p>That leaves leisure customers. Those are very price sensitive. They&#x27;re not going to spend an extra nickel to rent a car w/o a camera. Sometimes they will put up with taking a shuttle to an off-airport rental to save a few bucks. But, and this is very important, the smaller companies are less sophisticated in terms of customer screening. So the smaller companies are <i>more susceptible</i> to being scammed by customers. So they will probably be even more eager than the big guys to installing cameras, GPSes, etc to keep track of their cars.",1426560575

There is no unified way here to derive the deeplink from the web URL or vice versa. As such, we cannot treat deeplinks and web URLs as always templatized; these are simply URIs whose identities should be considered arbitrary.<p>On another slightly relevant note, from the perspective of linked data and the semantic web, the <link> tag or &quot;Link&quot; header (both which are suggested by Google and URX) is meant precisely for this kind of reason: being able to link separate resources with a given relation (e.g. &quot;alternate&quot;) who may have varying display/device/media qualities (e.g. media queries). Because semantic linkage is between two nodes of the web graph rather than DNS (which I guess would be a subgraph of the web?), one is able to use semantic metadata such as <a href=""http://schema.org/docs/actions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://schema.org/docs/actions.html</a> to describe not only how to access/consume a resource, but also alternate ways to do so (e.g. from an Android device instead of a desktop client).<p>Again the above isn&#x27;t completely impossible to do with DNS, I&#x27;ll give you that, but it simply is less tenable to assume template-like qualities of all URIs or to ignore the semantic implications of redefining how linked data has worked for the last decades.",1426560452

The technology industry needs to be far more circumspect about the hazards of what we do. We need less hype about changing the world, and more sleepless nights about the people we might be harming.<p>We need to be having big discussions <i>right now</i> about every aspect of technology, before we open Pandora&#x27;s box. For example, the World Anti-Doping Agency already have rules prohibiting genetic doping in sport, because they know that it&#x27;s a potential risk. They would rather figure out their policies now in the cold light of day, rather than in a panic when the Russian team arrive at the 2032 Olympics with a team of superhuman mutants.<p>AGI is a starting point for broader discussions about how society deals with increasingly powerful and ubiquitous computing technologies. Maybe it will happen, maybe it won&#x27;t, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s particularly important; What we can all agree on is that machine intelligence will only become more disruptive to society.<p>We need to plan now for what we would do <i>if</i> certain technologies come good. Driverless cars might never happen or they might be five years away, but we need to figure out what to do with the millions of Americans who drive for a living <i>before</i> we put them all out of work. What would be the social and ethical implications of brain-computer interfaces, of algorithmic decision-making in medicine or the criminal justice system, of ubiquitous facial recognition and tracking? How can we plan to mitigate those harms? If we don&#x27;t give serious thought to those kinds of questions, then we&#x27;re sleepwalking into the future.",1426560112

If you suppose that an AI could have radically different incentives and vectors than than a human, it seems implausible that you could be secure, even in practice. I suppose you could say that these would be implemented in time, but it&#x27;s not at all clear to me that a humanity which has trouble coordinating to stop global warming or unilateral nuclear disarmament would recognize this in time.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;m slightly puzzled by why you think there&#x27;s a huge unjustified leap between lack of value alignment and threat to the human race. Does most of your objection lie in 1) the lack of threat <i>any</i> given superintelligent AI would pose, because they&#x27;re not going to be that much smarter than humans or 2) the lack of worry that they&#x27;ll do anything too harmful to humans, because they&#x27;ll do something relatively harmless, like trade with us or go into outer space?<p>For 1, I buy that it&#x27;d be a lot smarter than humans, because even if it initially starts out as humanlike, it can copy itself and be productive for longer periods of time (imagine what you could do if you didn&#x27;t have to sleep, or could eat more to avoid sleeping). And we know that any &quot;superintelligent&quot; machine can be at least as efficient as the smartest humans alive. I would still not want to be in a war against a nation full of von Neumanns on weapons development, Muhammads on foreign policy and Napoleons on Military strategy.<p>For 2... I would need to hear specifics on how their morality would be close enough to ours to be harmless. But judging by your posts cross thread this doesn&#x27;t seem to be the main point.<p>By the way, I must thank you for your measured tone and willingness to engage on this issue. You seem to be familiar with some of the arguments, and perhaps just give different weights to them than I do.

Understanding a static well-organized human-designed system like a 787 or a chess-playing algorithm is far simpler than understanding the thoughts and desires of a dynamic intelligence.<p>A better analogy would be to stick to IQ. How long would it take a group of people with an average IQ of 70 to understand and predict the workings of the mind of a genius with an IQ of 210? Probably a very long time, if ever. What if the genius was involved in direct competition with the group of people?

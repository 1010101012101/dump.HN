If you point to a line of C code, I can tell you with very high certainty what assembly opcode(s) it will compile to. The only thing C does that might be considered a ""feature"" is memory abstraction, which is kind of important for any large programming project.<p>Now, if you're trying to advocate using Java or Python or something, you've obviously never worked on embedded software.

5431269,comment,5430891,5431215,2,0,jacques_chester,,,"A common example is the incomplete case problem (currently fixed by static analysis tools, I believe, but bear with me).<p>Suppose you have an enum:<p><pre><code>   enum rocket_states { ROCKET_WAITING, ROCKET_FLYING, ROCKET_FAULT }\n</code></pre>\nAnd a switch that runs off that enum:<p><pre><code>    switch ( some_rocket_state ) {\n      ROCKET_WAITING:\n        wait_foo();\n        wait_bar();\n        break;\n      ROCKET_FLYING:\n        fly_foo();\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis will compile. (Or maybe it won't, I haven't cut C for some time now).<p>But you've missed the ROCKET_FAULT case. In languages which check for case completeness, this kind of logical construction would cause a compiler failure. ML, F#, Rust etc will all complain that you haven't addressed all cases.<p>Sometimes this or something like it is added to a code template:<p><pre><code>      default: assert(false);\n</code></pre>\nWhich is defensive code that's great for test. But not as great for rockets. Better if bad code simply can't be written.<p>I believe static analysis tools can now pick up on missing cases, but there are still lots of reasons why C can't be as fully analysed as a language like ML, Haskell, ATS, Rust etc can be. Putting aside the obvious problem of undefined behaviour meaning you really want to push C code through multiple compilers and multiple static analysis tools, there's also the great universal escape hatch for C: direct memory access.<p>When you can simply go in and change memory, type systems and analysis are strictly speaking no longer going to work <i>without positive human effort to refrain from doing that</i>. Analysis can only make guarantees under certain assumptions; introduce direct memory access and all bets are off.<p>Yes, discipline and coding standards can also cut this down. Some analysis tools will do partial analysis of memory accesses. But it still requires <i>positive human action</i>. A computing system includes the humans who make it, run it and use it. Cutting down on the avenues for mistakes is a good thing.",1364103484

5431259,comment,5429651,5431055,4,0,vwinsyee,,,"Addressing #1: Most academic research the government funds is in basic science in expert domains, e.g. intercellular communication, neural firing patterns, etc, and much of this basic science is exploratory. For most projects, it would be difficult for everyone to agree on the goal and metrics of a competition. Sure, this might work for high-profile projects, e.g. establish a map of some organism's genome or connectome, or applied projects like your examples, but prize-based competitions would be difficult to implement on a large-scale. On another note, who would judge these competitions? For most domain-specific research, it would be peers in those domains -- so not much would be changed.<p>Addressing #2: This already exists. The government does contract out many tech projects, e.g. to Lockheed Martin or Boeing. Life science labs I've been associated with, have also received contracts from the NIH (as opposed to grants). While these aren't commission-based, these contracts are probably what you have in mind.<p>Address #3: This also already happens to a degree, typically with public  research universities. Especially when a new center opens, the state + federal government will give some minimum funds for the center or institute to keep their lights on. But no funding is ever ""permanent"", especially when you have politicians slashing research budgets. Finally, it's interestingly that you mention that these institutions would be more or less under the complete control by an executive director or a BOD. The article mentions that having individuals of such power over a field (as these executives would have) stifles change, and I agree. It would be too optimistic to believe that these executives would not pick and choose projects of their liking, which is actually pretty much what currently happens. Plus, not having to submit grants virtually guarantees less accountability.",1364103178

5431238,comment,5429824,5430234,6,0,ianb,,,"Another Minnesotan, who also moved to Chicago and moved back when considering where I wanted to raise a child...<p>I think part of what Linus gets wrong is that he confuses the correlation of high-property-tax well-funded districts with the performance of the schools in those districts.  The high property taxes (or property values or however the market works it out) doesn't make the schools good, it filters <i>out</i> people who are indifferent to the school quality, and filters in people who place a high value on education.  Once you cluster a lot of people with those values, the schools will be good; in part because of the peers a student will encounter, and in part because of all of the small but concrete things parents do to make the schools better.<p>Open enrollment without tuitions doesn't challenge that clustering.  To participate in open enrollment in Minnesota, you have to really value education: you have to figure out what the school is you want to attend, you have to figure out the bureaucracy to get in to that school, and you have to provide your own transportation to the school.  All those hurdles are just as good as high property taxes or high property values.<p>The irony is that as a result open enrollment is not as progressive as it might seem.  It's something the privileged can use to fix their children's education experience without moving, or allow people to trade effort for income.  But it doesn't bring the underprivileged up, because they really don't take advantage of open enrollment.  Though perhaps I'm using circular thinking, as I generally consider children with engaged, informed, and capable parents as ""privileged"" regardless of income; and maybe I even think that way because Minnesota supports that particular lifestyle choice via things like open enrollment.  It's a particular life arrangement that I didn't see much of in Chicago, and maybe that's no accident.",1364102521

5431226,comment,5429281,5430821,6,0,ChuckMcM,,,"It would indeed be an interesting situation if the spammers forced the creation of AI (either they doing it to make better spam or someone like Google to deny it).<p>One of the interesting things I have experienced in my time at Blekko has been that ""growth"" on the Web isn't really growing all that much. Sure there are trillions of pages being created but there are only so many things the few billion people in and around the Internet care about. There are 'hard information' places, which are things like libraries where reference searches are common, there are 'entity' places, be thay shops or service providers or SOMA startups, and there are ""transient"" places where information is current and then stale, to be stored and later reconstructed like coral into a 'dead' (in terms of change) but 'useful' base. Seeing the web from the point of view of a web scale crawler and indexer it starts to be clear that the mantra ""Organize all the world's information"" is getting  tantalizingly close to a dynamically stable froth.<p>I have to believe that Google has figured this out, some of the smartest engineers I've worked with are at Blekko but Google has its share as well. When you trawl through the fishery and all you get are trash fish you start to wonder, ""hmm did we actually catch <i>all</i> the fish there are?"" So to it goes with ""the Web"".<p>I started doing some speculation [1] on how you could value information that was discoverable on the Internet. And one of the schemes I came up with is how many people would find that information ""useful"", where useful really means they would have some reason of seeking it out. And then scaling that value by the value to them of having it. So for example if my genome was online, there is maybe a dozen people who would find it ""useful"", and of that dozen probably on the insurance actuaries and perhaps the occasional researcher who would find it ""valuable"".<p>Now one takes that unit of applicability/value and scales it again by the ""cost"" to acquire it (find it, index it, etc). And from that you can compute the total size of the Web. Well estimate it at least. So far my upper bound (based primarily on the fact that world population is stabilizing) is about 72 trillion documents at any given time.<p>When you look at it that way you can see that ultimately the spammers lose. They lose because over time the actual information that rises to the useful vs cost threshold is identified and classified, or the legitimate channels that provide dynamic information, or the legitimate archival sources that provide distilled information are all, for the most part known and 99.99% of all your users can find everything they want. And as a spammer you are no longer given the free reign of ""appear and be indexed"" you have to ask for admittance though some form or another. And the level of new credible sources that are created is inherently a function of the number of people that exist, and the number of people that exist is <i>stabilizing</i>.<p>When Yahoo started with its human curation it was vastly better than anything anyone else could do, and then it was overwhelmed by a combination of growth and algorithms that could much more rapidly infer curation from the social signals of bookmark pages and article reference. Curation has come back into favor, and it combined with machine learning algorithms will create what is essentially a stable corpus of documents[2] known as ""the web"".<p>Wikipedia is a great analog for what is happening world wide. All the reference articles they want to put in are nearly done, the number of editors required has gone down not up, and the future of web search is, in my opinion of course, similar. The only new ground on the web is social networking and Google understands that it seems. Its fortunate for them that only deep pocketed entity that is possibly a near time threat there is Microsoft, and since to date Microsoft is trying to do exactly what they did, they benefit from having already been through that part and know exactly what Microsoft will have to do next.<p>[1] My side hobby is attempting to discern the economics of information.<p>[2] Documents are just that, pieces of information, I hardly count every page rendered by Angry Birds in a browser as a separate document, in fact applications are them selves a single ""document"" in the since that some number of people will seek them out, and connect/consume them over what we think of as the ""web"" interface.",1364102311

I don't know if it's the comments, the clean code, or Go itself that makes it this easy, but it is. I used to believe ""It's easier to write code than it is to read it."", but now I'm thinking of rephrasing it ""It's easier to write mediocre code than it is to read it.""<p>I'm not a software developer, computer scientist, or any kind of paid engineer. I'm an amateur. I started to learn to code in late middle school, and just kept at it on and off until now, near the close of high-school. Now with the menacing sign of college (or work?) on the horizon I'm left with a little doubt. I have had a jump start on programming and I haven't just been doing Fizzbuzz and ""Hello, World!"" programs all this time. I got some fun things done with Pyglet, LVE, sockets, file I/O, and IRCBots, but besides the lack of any significant projects in a MANLY language (i.e. C, C++, Assembly) and the creation of any projects that have been useful to others beyond mild entertainment, the biggest deficiencies I have are that I've never worked in a large group project and I have great difficulty reading other peoples code.<p>I have a git-hub. I write code. I've worked collaboratively on some simple things with people, but usually everyone involved, including me, loses interest and the project stagnates. I tried contributing to open source software. There's this great site called OpenHatch. It taught me the basics about how to send in issues, generate patch files, and use subversion. All the projects that OpenHatch displayed issues for tended to be in Python. This was right up my alley, or so I thought. I had never used twisted, but twisted was the code base with the most ""easy-to-fix"" bugs. I made a mistake though. Because I was trying to fix a massive project I had never used before and barely understood I ran into some difficulty. As the result of all my efforts, I may or may not have fixed a typo in a python docstring. I wasn't used to the issue system so I didn't open the issue for review and someone else made an identical patch with the same name. To this day I'm still not sure which was accepted. Oh well, it probably wouldn't have counted for much anyway. I wouldn't really have been able to call myself an ""Open Source Developer!"" anyway.<p>Twisted was an extreme issue, but understanding other peoples code was always difficult. Oh sure, I could follow along with a tutorial or example video, but if I ever tried to explore git-hub I never ran into anything that made sense to me and wasn't very basic.<p>I'm writing all this because this feels like a turning point for me and I have no where else to say it.<p>It's a turning point because I really ""grokked"" your code. It made sense and I don't even really know Go that well. I definitely haven't created any large projects in it, or even any small useful ones. My only experience with Go was my own old very basic IRCBot framework that pales in comparison to the one that's linked and doesn't even work, the tour of Go, and a few lectures by Rob Pike. The bot framework was meant to be an ""OOP IRC Bot Framework in Go"". I was really missing the point of the language, and it wasn't until nearly a year after trying to build that basic project that I started to watch talks on the language and really work at the online tour.<p>I have no where else to say this because no one else that I'm friends with codes. They might have coded or be interested in coding, but they don't actively code. It's not a hobby for them. Saying ""I can read moderately complicated code on git-hub and it makes sense! :D"" doesn't really carry any weight.<p>So thanks. I can finally say ""I can read moderately complicated code on git-hub and it makes sense! :D"", so I will.\nI can read moderately complicated code on git-hub and it makes sense! :D<p>This bot is composed of some of the most useful code I've seen yet, and I haven't even compiled it.",1364101494

I'm sure people of Linus' grade of brainpower could do that. There's also a chance they'd discover that some of the city workers have pretty cushy benefit packages and the cost of it is more than they though it would be. And that they may be underfunded because some of the city workers fly to global warming conferences in luxury hotels in Hawaii on their dime, that is known to happen too.

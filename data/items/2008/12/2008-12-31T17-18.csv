See Standard Oil, John D. Rockefeller and some history about why we started trust busting in the first place.<p>Your view that the free market works wonderfully if left alone is simply naive.  The real world is simply more complex than that.<p>In fact, your belief that there even is such a thing as a <i>free market</i> is naive and ignores the very real fact that corruption is inevitable and businesses seek out regulation to protect themselves from competitors destroying the very free market they so claim to love.  Any truly free market is simply a temporary state of existence destined to die as soon as corruption takes hold, which it always does.",1230746389

Dennett's <i>Consciousness Explained</i> is like your above explanation of internal combustion engines.  Your explanation mentions combustion but is missing details about how the resulting pressure and forces are channeled.  His explanation is missing essential details as well.<p>There are no gremlins.  There are laws of physics.  There are facts of molecular biology.  We don't know all of these things yet.  I think it's premature to declare that ""there's nothing to explain"" until we know more about the brain.<p>I suspect we're like Galileo if he were confronted with an internal combustion engine.  He might be able to deduce that it's all just physical phenomena, but he wouldn't even know all of the physical laws a team of engineers would use to design the thing.",1230746355

With amazon prime it's free 2 day shipping on most things which is fast enough that I don't really care.  With a low base price, zero shipping costs, and no sales tax makes buying brand names online a lot cheaper and I don't need to drive anywhere so it saves me a lot of time.  On top of all of that I can research stuff online so I don't have to worry about buying junk with a nice package.<p>In the long run I think online shopping is going to win as long as shipping costs stay low enough. Delivery costs relate to the number of packages drooped off in the same area so they should drop as online delivery becomes more popular.  Toss in all the people who use catalogs and I expect a significant portion of purchases don't require wondering though a physical store.",1230745134

415669,comment,415606,415606,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"Beyond the obvious issue of over-population, two problems occur to me:<p>1) The human brain can only record up to about 200 years or so worth of data, so, beyond that, it cannot really store memories, so people might live to be say, 500, but the continuity of the individual would disappear. (Frank Rosenblatt of the Rosenblatt perceptron estimated that 200 year number, by the way.) Living so long one cannot recall who one once was seems a dubious proposition at best.<p>2) Evolution works by successive generations. If people live so long that they do not have a need to reproduce very often, then interesting evolutionary consequences will arise that I can only dimly speculate on. Seems like while the humans are in a blissful state of ageless biological stasis, other species will still be evolving, say, dolphins evolving opposable thumbs, or the like, and ultimately, humans will become trapped in a time-warp, biologically speaking. They won't evolve, but other species will. They may be sentient (e.g. chimpanzees, dolphins, even highly evolved mollusks and the like perhaps), or, they may be non-sentient, like viruses and the like. If we stop evolving, we will eventually go extinct, simple as that. Oh, and, uh, sex, Yeah, if there is no more need to reproduce, we will lose our sex drive. We could still replicate ourselves via cloning, but that whole copulation bit, that will be over.<p>So, basically to sum up, I see an ageless society as vastly over-populated, in 'Soylent Green' proportions, with people not even having a sense of memories about who they are as individuals. People stop f*king, since there is no more evolutionary impetus for that, and eventually we are replaced by viruses, sentient mollusks, or both.<p>What the anti-aging people will have to come to realize is that only the gene is immortal, her carriers are not, and if they try to be, the gene will still win in the end.",1230744369

415651,comment,415174,415352,0,0,jerf,,,"One of the great dangers of brain research today is that as we find the ""explanation"" for things, we will conclude they are just illusions and not real.<p>Well, the thing is, we're pretty sure at this point then that everything is ""an illusion"", by this standard. Religious experience, love, red, pain, it's all just an illusion brought on by neurons firing in certain patterns, right? Moving into the computer realm, the text box I am typing this into is an illusion brought on by clever programming, as is the browser. It's not an isolated series of claims of illusoriness, you need to consider the whole of them at once, including not just the politically popular ones (religion), but everything that argument makes sense for (red, mathematics, scary).<p>I submit to you that this view, while popular, is silly. How can <i>everything</i> be an illusion? That stretches the meaning of ""illusion"" beyond sensibility. I propose to you that the ""illusion"" is in fact the real thing, and what you considered <i>reality</i> was in fact an illusion brought on by your ignorance of how things truly work. Finding a neural explanation for an experience does not make it illusory, it merely brings it into the fold of things you partially understand, <i>displacing</i> your previous ignorant ideas about what is ""real"".<p>Failing to take this view is, IMHO, extraordinarily dangerous to yourself.<p>This text box is not an illusion. It is a text box in every way that matters. I send it keystrokes, it puts up text, you read it later. What more do you want? Red is not an illusion. It impinges upon my eyes, I see it and process in certain characteristic manners, all of which are every bit as real as anything else.<p>Higher levels of organization are not ""illusions"" merely because they are not atomic. My car is made of nuts and bolts and fabric and metal, and it <i>is</i> those things, profoundly, but it is <i>also</i> a car. My brain and self is made of neurons and glia and blood flow and individual firings, but it is also my self, nevertheless. My text box is no less real for being built twenty layers deep on various more atomic APIs.<p>To apply this directly to a contentious point, establishing the neural location of religious experiences does prove or disprove them any more than establishing the neural locations of ""pain"" proves pain isn't real. To disprove a worldview, you need to use logic of the form ""Given your worldview, this fact about the world conflicts"", and ""I found your religious experiences in the brain"" doesn't fit that mould. Christians, Muslims, and other religions with creator gods will claim that the creator god put the circuits there because they tap something real. Hindus may not claim a creator god put it there (I know less about Hinduism), but they will still claim it is there because it taps something real. And so on, for many religions.<p>I'm not saying this disproves the atheistic, Darwinistic view of religion the ""I found the neurons"" discovery engenders for such people. I'm saying it doesn't disprove most religions to any greater extent, either; it's basically null evidence on that front.<p>(And heck, while I'm making controversial statements, may I also add that IMHO this viewpoint very nicely harmonizes the traditionally disparate ""Western"" and ""Eastern"" views of the world, and that they not only need not be at loggerheads but actually fuse into something quite nice.)",1230743517

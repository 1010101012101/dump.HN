410724,comment,410563,410676,0,0,rms,,,"Frankly, I find the idea of ""natural health"", when pitched to cancer patients, offensive. Sure, I am willing to believe that eating more organic, raw, and otherwise non-processed food seriously reduces the risk of cancer. But prevention is not a treatment. You can't raw food your way to a cure to cancer. It just doesn't work. People die because they become so deluded. Indiscriminate as it may be, chemotherapy works.<p>You suggest that naturopathic medicine is opposed to mainstream cancer treatment, but you don't suggest alternatives. What is an effective alternative to chemotherapy?",1230350172

I doubt they were in any position to search all of the patents <i>applied for</i> and challenge the validity of all of the vague ridiculousness that  was currently on file that may some day interfere with a 20% project that might possibly become a product!<p>This is <i>submarine-ary</i> of the first order.

If what we're in is likely to be worse than everthing <i>else</i> since the 1930s, can it really be so clear that it's not actually worse than the G.D. too? It seems like the readily available journalistic cliches just don't allow for that possibility...",1230350018

410719,comment,410014,410631,0,0,DenisM,,,"How would they go about spending 7 trillion? Serious question.<p>If money is given to citizens they will likely hoard it rather than spend. Instead Chinese government used to give the money to American citizens because those never really save anything and it comes all back to stimulate the Chinese economy. Now this meachanism is broken. The only option left is government spending - ""the new deal for China"". Indeed that's what they are planning to do, but I don't think the new deal can replace the employment opportunities lost.",1230349906

Our economy is fueled by consumerism and the service industry. When shit goes down, which do you think has a chance of surviving when countries like China decide to stop subsidizing our spending (by holding down their currencies) in order to enjoy the fruits of their own labor themselves? Forthcoming political unrest in some of these countries are significant factors that lie outside of our own control.<p>(I'm writing this on my iPhone so I apologize for not ellaborating with a more coherent response, but just think about some of these things.

Use the STL.<p>Of course, most people that 'know' C++ learned it in college, which tends to be a lousy place to learn anything technical. They think of C++ as C with objects. In fact it's a language with all the power and nearly all the expressiveness of modern scripting languages, but tends to run everything a hundred times faster.<p>C++ is a multi-paradigm language. Its ""objects,"" which tend to get more coverage than anything else during college courses, are actually the most uninteresting and least useful part of the language.

I found my team via a post on hackernews.<p>I can answer questions, but the one thing that I don't think any other incubator program has is the diversity and community. Some of us had dinner last night, and at the table were at least 9 nationalities represented, which is totally normal in startup chile. And they all have a common passion of technology, business, and innovation. The program self organizes into topical groups, and all in the name of information sharing. I truly believe the success of the program hinges on this network.<p>Santiago is safe, just like the rest of the country, and the economic development arm of the govt is very aggressive. I believe they are matching 50% of private funding for economic development, and it is common for startup chile graduates to get some of this funding if they decide to stay in Chile. (We were just awarded a grant to help internationalize and promote our business outside of Chiles borders, for instance)<p>We met with a large well respected law firm yesterday to look into incorporating here, and they are also modelling the SV/NYC pro bono/deeply discounted rates for startups, which is great sign and definitely needed.<p>Lots of opportunity down here for someone that wants to be part of an amazing community.",1349981985

I have to say, the UX from sign up through implementation is exceptional, and virtually seamless. I particularly liked the install verification sequence, and the brief yet informative animated introduction to the dashboard. Kudos to your team for creating a product that's such a pleasure to use and look at!<p>A few very minor nit's to pick: Overall, the login screen is great, but omitting the submit button seems a bit too minimalist. I know what to do because the response of using the Return or Enter or Go key is by now second nature; it might not be as apparent to less geeky folks. Besides, the design choice is jarring given how prominent a button you're using for the password reset flow.<p>Regarding the visual flow in the sign up process: It's probably already on your list of ToDo's, but the form styling between the join and login screens is substantially different.<p>After installing your tracking script on both a static page and using the Wordpress plugin, and double checking the installation verification, I had to go through the dashboard introduction a second time. It would be ideal if there was button allowing me to dismiss/opt-out of the intro.<p>Lastly, I'd suggest experimenting with an additional tier of pricing above the $9 mark but below the custom enterprise level. My intuition is that there's a level where people want more capability but are reluctant to go through the personalized and uncertain ""Enterprise"" process. Also, it's possible people might be more likely to choose a paid plan if there was more than one option; that's definitely the response I personally had.<p>Just off the cuff, one version might be:<p>Free: 1 site, 1 individual<p>Standard: 3 Sites, 5 team members. $9/month<p>Premium: 10 Sites, 10 team members, exclusive premium features. $19/month<p>To be sure, you don't want to cannibalize your Enterprise sales, so it's worth comparing these price and usage points to what data you have in that area.<p>Finally, grandfathering existing Premium users in this scenario would be as simple as upgrading them to the new level and giving them a $10/month discount for the life of their account.<p>Good luck, and great product!",1349981159

If a user bothers to type in their email address, they will probably also try a password and click login at least once before clicking ""Forgot Password"", so by then the email will be blank again.<p>2) Another interesting difference is how this site and Quora display user photos.  Quora will tell you if your e-mail is not in the system or needs confirmation, while this site always returns an invalid password message, even if the user doesn't exist in the system.<p>The big UX flaw here is that a photo might frustrate a typical user into trying lots of passwords since their photo shows up when they type their e-mail address, when in fact they don't have an account or used another e-mail to register.",1349981142

I've gotten it down to a few bullets:<p>1) A pool of risk tolerant capital.<p>You need the capital to start the businesses, people pitch the money men for seed, series A - D, rounds.<p>2) A lack of regulation on competition.<p>You need to understand that existing, powerfully connected, companies are going to get disrupted and you need to prevent them from killing off the startups.<p>3) A failure tolerant culture.<p>You need to understand that Silicon Valley is awash in failures, they are everywhere, but they don't have the same sort of stigma they might elsewhere. This disassociation between personal failure and startup failure is key.<p>Typically, the first challenge is that culturally the company sees failure as a problem for the individual ""He failed at his business"" which needs to morph into ""One of the businesses he started (positive affirmation) didn't take off. (business failed, he didn't)"" That is hard for a lot of people who have historically thought of businesses as things you put your whole life into.<p>The next thing is pointing out to powerful people that their 'friends' will ask them to kill the very thing they are trying to start when it starts costing them money. To understand a successful startup you have to understand that if they are successful they start out by re-directing capital flow to (or through) them which funds their growth. I've used AirBnB a couple of times as a great example of this (although Uber works as well). Here is a startup which is growing by taking money that would have gone to Hotel chains, and instead putting it into the hands of these non-hoteliers. So the Hotels are going to be irritated and try to stop it, be prepared for that.<p>The challenge is that the impression people start with is that 'Silicon Valley' is composed of startups which are always new ""green field"" businesses that bring great returns to modest investment.

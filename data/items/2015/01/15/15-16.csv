8893177,comment,8892587,8892587,0,0,geebee,,,"Open floor plan offices are generally pretty unpleasant, but some of the negative effects can be mitigated.<p>I worked at Sun Micro a while ago (the place that is now Facebook), and we all had offices at the time.  However, Sun had also started to create numerous drop-in work centers.  One of them was in downtown SF, just south of market.<p>This was an &quot;open&quot; office with three largish rooms with cubicles and desks, and a smaller number of offices with doors that close (reservable or walk in).<p>Here&#x27;s what made it work - one of the rooms was designated a &quot;zone of silence&quot;, and it really was enforced.  The two outer rooms had phones at each desk, the quiet room did not.  Sales people and other workers who needed to make noise worked in the outer rooms, programmers and other heads down people worked in the quiet room.<p>Not surprisingly, there were plenty of people who wanted to break the rules.  This generally happened when all the desks in the loud room were taken.  Then you&#x27;d get people trying to take phone calls in the quiet room on their cell phones.  Some felt that as long as they spoke in a relatively hushed tone of voice, it would be ok (though everyone could still hear their conversation).  Others figured that the phone could ring, and they could start their conversation in the room, as long as they were actively walking outside the room as they talked.<p>What saved it was an office manager who simply wouldn&#x27;t tolerate it.  She would absolutely tell people that they couldn&#x27;t do this, and that their right to work from the drop in center would be revoked if they continued to do it. She didn&#x27;t care about their rank, or if they liked her.<p>I did have a couple of ugly moments about it.  I very politely asked people on a couple of occasions not to use their phones in the designated quiet room (with signs everywhere about it), and more than once, they started in on how much more important their work was than mine.<p>But it was relatively rare, because the signage and vibe of the room really was pretty clear about it, and the office manager was very strict and just didn&#x27;t have the kind of personality that was easily pushed around.",1421337558

8893172,comment,8890899,8891284,0,0,psaintla,,,"My first web dev job was at a company in that situation.  Trust me when I say that would never happen.  By the time a company reaches the position myspace is in they usually have a penny pinching CEO that sees engineering as an expense.  The entire codebase is usually put in maintenance mode until there is a drop in ad revenue.  That&#x27;s when the board and CEO create a panic project to refresh the site or introduce a new gimmick to fight the decline.  That usually happens once a year or so.<p>Little thought is given to efficiency or refactoring because the decision makers don&#x27;t care about that.  Everything eventually becomes about quick quarterly &quot;wins&quot; so that executive management can earn their bonuses.  In practice this means if you can&#x27;t plan, complete and show the project directly increased revenue or decreased expenses for that quarter it won&#x27;t become a priority.<p>That is the wonderful shortsighted world of a one product company in decline :-)",1421337505

But there are lots of languages that address the problems mentioned by those startups, and I think that Go is possibly the worst of the options.<p>It&#x27;s telling that none of the startups in question switched out of a language which provides good compile-time type and thread-safety guarantees:<p>1. iron.io: ruby -> go\n2. SendGrid: perl -> python -> go\n3. TJ Holowaychuck: node.js -> go<p>Go would have a reasonable compile-time type system, except that without generics you end up having to cast a lot, which renders your compile-time type system almost irrelevant.<p>It&#x27;s also telling that none of the authors mentioned experience with functional programming. Go supports some functional programming, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a very big part of the language. The only one who mentions that they even considered any functional languages is the iron.io guy, and it seems like a big part of his choice was not technical: he mentions that he had to sell the idea of Go to his team by mentioning that Google supports it. A language that was a more serious paradigm shift (OO -> functional) would have been an even harder sell.<p>(EDIT: Okay, the SendGrid guy did mention considering Scala.)<p>The fact is, there are a bunch of languages that would have solved their problems, in addition to a few they didn&#x27;t know they had. Julia has coroutines similar to Go, but is much more expressive, Rust has a more traditional threading model but a type system and focus on immutability that provides better safety guarantees. There are other choices, but those two stand out as the major ones that could have solved their problems better than go.",1421337418

Uncomfortable chairs. Annoying conversations. Hipster baristas.<p>Yet people all over the world cram into coffee shops like Starbucks, sucking up the free wifi with a grande half-calf mocha latte, churning out a report or answering e-mails, sometimes even on a conference call. Conditions that could border on sweatshop if it weren&#x27;t for the food and drink. It seems completely unintuitive.<p>Are there benefits to this environment? Perhaps.<p>For one thing, you don&#x27;t know anyone there; nobody is going to interrupt you, or tell loud inappropriate jokes while tossing a football, and you are so close to people you are forced to focus on what is right in front of you. You get the comfort of being near other humans without any requirement to ever interact with them. Then there&#x27;s the convenience of easy access to food, a bathroom, and that miracle drug we&#x27;re all dependent on. Add the internet and a table and chair and it&#x27;s like some utopian Japanese vision of the future of all offices. The music is a nice bonus.<p>But there&#x27;s one thing I think really makes the coffee shop an ideal place to work: no expectations.<p>You can come and go as you please. No assigned seats. No meetings. No interruptions. Nothing but your coffee and chair and table space and internet. Who cares if it&#x27;s loud? Who cares if it&#x27;s impractical to stay there?

[0]<p>Myself and a friend worked for Nick a few years back helping build out some of the HTML5 game concepts. We prototyped different games using various engines (PlayN, etc) and ended up along with some other contractors on Haxe-based Flambe as the best choice for HTML5. We actually launched a couple of games [1][2], though a lot of our work ended up internal-only.<p>When we started, the iPad 1 was still considered a current browser. The performance on that device was abysmal. When the iPad 2 and newer versions of iOS came around, we finally had access to accelerated <canvas> and could really start making things work.<p>The other things we prototyped for Nick were in-game video and multiplayer gaming. The in-game video was pretty bad for cross-browser support. In the end, Flambe gave us a tool (Flump) that had the ability to import from Flash animations that was significantly better than trying to force iPads and Android devices to play video reliably and consistently.<p>Multiplayer support was the least painful new ground we worked on -- using engine.io and Redis on the backend we were able to scale to tens of thousands of simultaneous users without spending too much on EC2. For the most part it &quot;just worked&quot;.<p>If there&#x27;s one lesson I learned from this experience, it&#x27;s that developing games for existing properties is tough work. There are so many stakeholders that things take forever to get done. Considering the value of the properties, this isn&#x27;t surprising.<p>The second lesson would be that HTML5 is moving so fast that you&#x27;ll probably have to rebuild your games every few months to support all of the changes that are happening in the space. Most of the games we launched a little more than a year ago are already starting to bitrot.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/aduros/flambe"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/aduros/flambe</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nick.com/games/spongebob-squarepants-spongebob-squared-multiplayer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nick.com/games/spongebob-squarepants-spongebob-sq...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nick.com/games/data/korra/korra-pai-sho/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nick.com/games/data/korra/korra-pai-sho/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.nick.com/games/kca-2013-multiplayer-trivia.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nick.com/games/kca-2013-multiplayer-trivia.html</a> (no longer there -- probably our most polished release)",1421337211

I talked to the engineers and with one exception each person wanted private offices. We set up one floor of the office with high cubicle walls, and a lot of sound isolation. So not exactly private offices, but really a pretty nice setup (with the best equipment and furniture available).<p>On a separate floor we had a bullpen with ops folks, people who were on the phone a lot, etc. One by one, each engineer gravitated towards the bullpen until no one spent more than perhaps 1 day per week in the dedicated office space. The part of the office that each engineer had claimed to want to work in became abandoned.<p>I think, in spite of the theoretical want for quiet space and isolation, there&#x27;s a very human need at work to be in the middle of the action -- to hear what&#x27;s going on, and to be connected to your colleagues. There were certain tasks and problems for which engineers would walk downstairs and make use of the dedicated space, but it was ultimately not where folks wanted to be on a daily basis.",1421337155

My grandfather would never have believed that we have cars that drive themselves. Many baby boomers I work with are still wowed by the basic AI of Siri/GNow/Cortana, or even google search. Common sense and philosophical musings just isn&#x27;t enough to figure out if something is feasible.<p>Thinking isn&#x27;t that hard of a nut to crack, imho.  Enough of a ruleset/branch logic is thinking. We don&#x27;t need to emulate a person perfectly, the same way we don&#x27;t have self-driving cars losing their tempers or tailgating people out of spite. We just need to distill the intelligence we want and voila, you have AI.<p>AI isn&#x27;t just a HAL-like character. Its a lot of things.  In fact, it surrounds us. There&#x27;s expert systems, fuzzy logic, etc controlling pretty much the entirety of our technological lives. I have no idea what drugs Musk is on, but its dangerous for him to piss on AI publically.  I imagine, from a practical pov, spreading FUD about AI makes sense for him economically.  For someone who wants human spaceflight, talking down about robots and AI is a means to an end. Now the public doesn&#x27;t want a cheap-ish robot mission on Mars with some guy in Houston wearing an Oculus-like headset. Or autonomous robots on the moon. They want a meatbag on the surface, for their own emotional and philosophical needs, price be dammed.  &quot;Price be damned&quot; in spaceflight makes Musk a very happy camper, considering he&#x27;s going to get a lion&#x27;s share of that money.<p>There&#x27;s something really neo-luddite about human spaceflight. Its like we can&#x27;t admit to ourselves that machines, AI, etc just are a better fit for it. Anyone else notice that about three months ago there&#x27;s been endless anti-AI sentiment in the press? Where is this stuff coming from? Who is funding it? I really think Musk and others see it as a major threat to their companies and social capital and are trying to change the narrative to suit them and their goals. I don&#x27;t think we typically appreciate how one wealthy person or organization can easily astroturf the web and the press.<p>Personally, I think the more feasible futurist path is actually taking the environment seriously, pushing the path to peace politically, trying to bring in a post-scarcity world via cheap replication, and using AI the same way we use all tools -- for our benefit.  Fleeing to some other planet or moon without fixing life on Earth first guarantees we bring our terrible politics and baggage to this new destination.  Let&#x27;s fix things here first and then worry about moving to Mars. &quot;Fixing things&quot; more than likely involves strong AI implementations in various parts of our lives.",1421337035

But eventually the maintenance costs will catch up, and you&#x27;ll have service outages that take days to fix because it&#x27;s run by lazy government workers with a guaranteed pension. Customers will complain, but nothing will happen until the city goes broke (as happens to nearly every city every decade or so). So the city auctions off the telecom infrastructure to private buyers for pennies on the dollar or spin it off as a new private entity. The net result is the same: the taxpayers will have subsidized the construction of yet another redundant telecommunications network owned by private money.<p>The reason I&#x27;m pretty sure that this is what will happen is because this is exactly what&#x27;s happened to most of the municipally-owned utilities across the nation. Chances are that your gas company or electric company are privately owned (water/sewage tends to remain municipally owned because it&#x27;s simply not profitable under any scenario that preserves basic sanitation). The city hits a budget crisis and starts looking for assets to sell, and utilities are huge capital assets that can bring in a lot of cash relatively quickly.",1421336609
8893065,comment,8891058,8892078,0,0,king_jester,,,"> I believe that most &quot;normal&quot; people are capable of doing enough exercise (combined with good eating choices) that they can lose weight.<p>The point is there is there no set point of &quot;enough&quot; exercise to induce weight loss. It is highly variable between people and it is very unlikely that any individual can keep weight off in this fashion over a period of time. Linking exercise and weight is a time waster and, more importantly, can dissuade people from exercising when they don&#x27;t achieve an impossible standard for weight loss.<p>> For example, say you have a 1-hour lunch break each day. During that lunch break, you could easily go for a 6km run (30-40 minutes), as well as have time for a shower, and grab food. If you&#x27;re prepared to have a faster shower, and eat a quick snack, heck, you could even make it a 10km run (50 minutes).<p>First of all, the majority of workers do not have hour long lunch breaks. Second, that exercise during the middle of the work day sounds like a great way to ratchet up stress rather than be relaxing since now you are stuck in a time management game. This isn&#x27;t an appropriate approach for everyone.<p>> Either way, I personally know many ordinary people who manage to get a healthy amount of exercise, and achieve their weight goals.<p>Again, this notion of a &quot;healthy amount&quot; of exercise is a fiction w.r.t. weight loss.<p>> I also have a friend who quite honestly, eats what seems to be an incredibly unhealthy mix - think large amounts of junk food and deep-fried fast food. However, they manage to stay reasonably slim (think BMI 18) by doing insane amounts of exercise (several hours a day). So it&#x27;s definitely achievable, assuming you have that sort of willpower.<p>This person would likely still be a low BMI even without exercise.<p>> What studies are you referring to, that show that &quot;normal&quot; exercise will not cause weight loss? I&#x27;d be very curious to see them.<p>For a compilation of study data about weight loss, see the first half of Health at Every Size [1] (this is not an endorsement of a HAES lifestyle, but this book does collect the evidence).<p>[1] www.amazon.com/Health-At-Every-Size-Surprising/dp/1935618253/",1421336599

Now that I&#x27;ve been working for startups, I&#x27;ve worked in more bullpen-type offices.<p>A few things:<p>1) Having my own office did not mean that there weren&#x27;t distractions. It&#x27;s impractical to build sound-proof walls between offices and the guy across from me loved to try to sing opera for hours a day. I eventually moved offices to another part of campus for that reason.<p>2) Likewise, I&#x27;ve worked in open offices that were pretty monastic. Engineers are quiet, everyone is wired in and most people talk on Slack/HipChat. The only interruption was when the mailman would drop off the daily mail.<p>3) I think the worst thing about open offices are the logistics of staff that need to take phone calls. As a customer-facing programmer that does sales support and configuration assistance it&#x27;s sub-optimal not having a dedicated space for phone calls. When the perfect storm arises of too many people needing to take calls, everything flies into anarchy where I&#x27;m forced to take a call in a common space and try to be quiet. A bullpen that has some separation and accommodation for those needs is ok. A bullpen that doesn&#x27;t have that is not.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.xconomy.com/wisconsin/2014/09/19/epic-hopes-wi-campus-can-help-in-talent-war-with-apple-facebook/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xconomy.com/wisconsin/2014/09/19/epic-hopes-wi-ca...</a>",1421336572

You say they should be handled in a special/deliberate way, but that&#x27;s what it means for something to have a distinct type: it can&#x27;t be handled like everything else. You just define special error-handling functions and they will work on errors and nothing else, and nothing else will work on errors.<p>As far as syntax goes, the I feel the big issue is about deferring error handling. You don&#x27;t always want to mix error handling code with your algorithm logic, so you need to defer. We also talk about &#x27;errors&#x27; so generally that we never bother to qualify which kinds of errors should be deferred or not in a way that is encapsulated in the type system. Or what kind of deferring should be available -- return errors or just move them later in the same scope? (Java&#x27;s checked exceptions are a good example of attempting to do this, but it doesn&#x27;t work out in practice. Programmers don&#x27;t think like programs do: deferred error handling isn&#x27;t the same as deferred error-handler writing, and both are needed in different ways.)<p>From what I can tell about error handling in Go, it isn&#x27;t really a step forward.

Another potential problem is when<p>An analogy to my other comment on AST translation: in English you &quot;like doing something&quot; but in German you &quot;do something gladly&quot; (and again in English you &quot;like a person&quot; but in German you can &quot;have a person dear&quot;, akin to English &quot;hold dear&quot;).  If we expect that the AST can produce a translation using the single verb &quot;like&quot;, we may be in for trouble if the target language doesn&#x27;t do that (although maybe code can be written that uses the AST and that&#x27;s aware of this complexity as part of the realization of the translation).<p>Another example could come from the problem of describing states of being or perception, like &quot;I&#x27;m cold&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m tired&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m hungry&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m thirsty&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m sick&quot;, etc.  In English we really like using &quot;to be&quot; plus adjectives for such situations, but other languages have other preferred strategies.  For example Latin has specialized verbs for the actions of (at least) being hungry, thirsty, or sick (like esurio, sitio, aegroto); in Romance languages people often &quot;have&quot; hunger or thirst (Spanish &quot;tengo hambre&quot;, lit. &#x27;I have hunger&#x27;; Portuguese &quot;estou com fome&quot;, lit. &#x27;I am with hunger&#x27;); in German it is cold &quot;to&quot; a person (&quot;mir ist kalt&quot;, not &quot;ich bin kalt&quot; &#x27;I am a cold person&#x27;).<p>If you imagine having your AST start with Latin, you may have a challenging story about how you could get from &quot;sitisne?&quot; to &quot;are you thirsty?&quot; &quot;¿tienes sed?&quot; &quot;está com sede?&quot; and &quot;hast du durst?&quot; -- not to deny that it may be achievable with enough work.",1421336169

Something like Haskell or Rust, hoping the type checker will prevent some class of errors. You hope to avoid errors ahead of time here. This approach is taken for some critical systems. Navigation, medical equipment, military hardware etc.<p>2) Isolate errors when they happen. Errors will happen at runtime, even in a typed-checked language. How do you want to deal with them? You can deal with them in an easy way -- isolate the component that fails and degrade the system slightly without completely stopping service. Or even better restart just that one sub-components. Or, have everything come crashing down with an exception or tracelog and get a call from a customer.  Erlang and Elixir (and other BEAM VM) languages do this best.  You can to a certain way replicate this with OS processes, but Erlang has that built-in.  The reason for that is concurrency primitives (processes in Erlang, others have tasks/goroutines/threads) do not share a global heap. So that lets you both isolate the errors they happen to one component, and lets you separate main code from error handling code (you can have supervisors that watch other processes and if they crash they can deal with it better).",1421336089

Yes, Java 8 has closures, but then again it will be a very long time until the ecosystem will move to using them. And for example, even though Scala has baked-in features to make functional programming much more pleasant / practical, it&#x27;s not those features that position it as a functional programming language, but rather the ecosystem around it. In other words, even though you can mostly use a language that has closures in an FP fashion (and people did so with languages like Java or Javascript), it&#x27;s painful doing so not only because of the language and the standard library, but also because the other people and the supporting libraries are not doing that and then you&#x27;re the weirdo that swims against the tide.<p>On the other hand the JVM on the whole is an extremely good platform and given that one can use on top alternative languages that do make a difference, like Scala, Clojure, Ceylon or Groovy, well that&#x27;s the comparison I&#x27;d like to see ... the JVM versus Go.<p>On your arguments - Java&#x27;s checked exceptions are deeply broken IMHO, but something that works much better in the context of a static language are types such as `Try[T]`, `Either[L,R]`, `Option[T]` or `Validation[E,A]` from Scala. They achieve their purpose of documenting the error in the function&#x27;s signature and can do much more than exceptions can, they force you to either deal with it or escalate and their API is very comfortable. Unfortunately whenever you bring these into a discussion, people dismiss them because you know, monads and applicative functors are apparently too &quot;academical&quot;. But we keep reinventing broken wheels, because we can&#x27;t bother to learn anything else that isn&#x27;t in the gang of four.<p>On Go my personal opinion is that it is a very poor choice compared to the JVM, even when speaking about Go&#x27;s strongest points, like performance and concurrency and yes, I believe that the JVM is a strong winner on all points.

Also, the complex was large enough that you could escape into some personal space without feeling like you were hiding.<p>On the other hand, Gannett attempted a setup like this, except it was out of cheapness (they wanted to lease office space in their Tysons HQ) and was carried out mindlessly.

Maybe because it&#x27;s my first &quot;real&quot; office job, but I do not find much of a problem working here. When I want to be on my own to think on stuff, I just put my headphones on (sometimes with music, sometimes without, since they are good at canceling noise anyway) and it&#x27;s like being in my own isolated office. And if that is not enough, we have small cubicle-like mini-rooms where you can go and isolate yourself, most people use them to have phone conversations or do interviews, but nothing stops you from working in there with your laptop.<p>All in all, though, maybe it&#x27;s my floor that is very quiet but there&#x27;s not much distraction or annoying background noise as most people are busy working. When they are not working, they go somewhere else (the pub, the relax rooms, etc etc). If they want to have a work-related conversation that lasts more than 5-10 minutes, we have open areas with whiteboards separated from the desk area, or we have separate conference rooms you can use. Most of the time, I enjoy taking my headphones off and listening to a couple of coworkers making remarks on stuff (either work or non-work related), it helps me relieve stress and boredom much more than just staring at a wall or reading some articles online.<p>Ironically, the major source of annoyance in our floor recently has been the old AC system that sometimes starts making very loud noises and bothers everybody, but this is not the fault of the openspace office so it doesn&#x27;t count :)",1421335859

If your process encounters an error, it will crash, the supervisor will restart it, and it will continue processing.  Of course, you can choose to handle anticipated errors if you would like to be more user friendly (e.g. provide a user-friendly message if a file is missing), or if you want to log the error or something.  But generally it&#x27;s considered defensive programming and an antipattern to try and handle every error condition in an Erlang program like you have to do with e.g. Java exceptions.<p>In languages with powerful type systems like Haskell, errors can be handled by using (for example) the Either[1] type.

Nevertheless, the word &quot;political&quot; conveys just as much information as needed to study it as a field -- like the word &quot;physics&quot;. Physics covers a lot (in fact, it encompasses politics, too, so it carries even less meaning), and yet there are some things in nature that you&#x27;d study through the prism of physics while others through the prism of biology, so the word physics seems to be quite useful to define a field of study. So is the word politics (or political).<p>There are, of course, many sub-types of politics -- as you&#x27;d have known if you&#x27;d bothered to look it up on Wikipedia.

The amount of calories burned are trivial.<p>For example:<p>- 30 minute run burns (150 pound individual) burns just 272 calories.<p>- 30 minute lap swim (150 pound individual) burns, again, just 272 calories.<p>A single Milky Way chocolate bar has 240 calories. A Big Mac has 530 calories. A McDonalds Chicken Classic Sandwich 350 calories. And so on. So you can exercise for an hour and then regain the weight in under a minute. That&#x27;s how few calories exercise burns.<p>The primary way people lose weight is BMR (basal metabolic rate), this is calories burned just keeping you alive. You literally lose weight while you sleep due to BMR.<p>People often like to claim &quot;&#x27;calories in&#x27; need to be lower than &#x27;calories out&#x27;&quot; and while that is true to a point, it is an over simplification (i.e. even with identical calories certain things, like sugar, are kept as fat to a greater extent than other things, such as fiber, which are &quot;ejected&quot;).<p>So, yes, please exercise. You&#x27;ll live longer, feel healthier, and it might even shed one or two pounds if you&#x27;re already skinny. But if you&#x27;re obese and need to shed 10+ pounds then your diet is the primary means by which you&#x27;ll accomplish your goals, in fact you can lose all of your weight while in a coma on a hospital bed, so all you need to do is under-eat for your BMR (but consult your doctor, and try to eat a balanced diet).<p>I recommend using something like MyFitnessPal. It is free. Just set it up, it will track your BMR and what you eat, and as long as you stay in the &quot;green&quot; (below the BMR) you&#x27;ll eventually lose some weight.<p>However please keep in mind &quot;water weight&quot; is a legitimate thing.

6488908,comment,6488449,6488449,2,0,bane,,,"Of course this isn&#x27;t &quot;fair&quot;. In countries without competitive industries (either because those industries are growing, or because they&#x27;re fading), the domestic lawmakers want to give local business a leg-up over foreign businesses. For example, this kind of protectionism was a major strategy of South Korea&#x27;s industrial growth policy.<p>A more specific example, for <i>many</i> years (and perhaps still today), to help foster the domestic film industry, foreign movie imports (which were usually American films, Japanese media has been entirely illegal until very recently) were artificially limited at some small number. The idea was to provide a little competition in the form of high-budget, high-quality films but give enough room for local film makers to figure out the top-to-bottom of making competitive movies. It was a garden fence to let air and light in, but keep damaging critters out. It worked, the Korean film industry is booming, growing and has started exporting and Korean TV dramas are watched heavily all over the region.<p>So, it&#x27;s no surprise that France, with a strong literary heritage, wants to protect the entire domestic market and supply chain, from writers to publisher to retailers in order to keep such a cultural activity &quot;French&quot;. The question is, is it just a wall to keep outsiders out, or is it a garden fence with a growth plan to grow and eventually export French literary culture like Korea exports Movies and Dramas?",1380808789

It is in your best interest. The expectation that if we are polite to some adversarial authority then they&#x27;ll go easier on us seems quite widespread (seems to me it has some deep bio/psychological roots). Unfortunately, it&#x27;s completely false.  The police doesn&#x27;t care the least bit if you are cooperative, polite, prompt, not a dick...  In fact, they are trained to exploit one&#x27;s urge to be polite, honest and helpful against you.<p>If law enforcement decides to come after you (for whatever reason), no politeness in the world is going to make them turn around and say: &quot;Gee, what a nice fellow, we&#x27;re sure sorry we wasted his time.&quot;  They are there to get you, not to negotiate and make good first impressions.

He repeatedly says he offered to pay the owner back for the missing items. Should that mean that he can&#x27;t be charged with theft? If I steal something and get caught, should I just be able to offer to pay and avoid prosecution? He repeatedly says that the missing items amount to at most a civil matter, but stealing stuff from work is not a civil matter.<p>For the rest of it, the author doesn&#x27;t have a leg to stand on. Say instead of an encrypted partition we were talking about a safe. I kept a safe in my office, and one day I was summarily fired and escorted out of the building. I promised that there was no business information or property of my employer in that safe, then refused to hand over the combination.

It&#x27;s so common for disgruntled employees to steal company property or damage company property that nobody is going to give him the benefit of the doubt except the jury, who is legally required to. The author repeatedly mentions the standard for conviction (beyond a reasonable doubt).

Prior to that, you could have not assisted, forcing the LEA to do it themselves, and if you had crypto and no technical ability to turn over the keys, it&#x27;d be at worst a shutdown.  Now, you probably can be legally compelled to assist fully and subvert anything.<p>I assumed this stuff only applied to CALEA entities like PSTN, PSTN-interconnected-voip, and broadband ISPs; it appears it is actually patriot and means there&#x27;s enough legal pretext to essentially always get keys:<p>1) Any non-CALEA entity probably does NOT have a system which can log <i>every</i> pen trap piece of data desired.  If there&#x27;s even a single thing which your system internally can&#x27;t provide, LEA could argue that their own pen trap would be more effective, and could compel you to turn over keys to populate their device.  They could compel you to generate new keys outside an HSM if you have technical controls to protect your existing keys from disclosure, too, and disguise that as &quot;hsm failure&quot; or something like that.  It seems pretty open ended.<p>A non-charitable view of the entire Lavabit thing is that it was a roundabout way/pretext to compel key disclosure.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if USG uses the keys illegally for something which isn&#x27;t used in a criminal prosecution; the data in Snowden&#x27;s mail is of intelligence value where those rules don&#x27;t apply.<p>2) Unless Patriot 216 is found unconstitutional, Ladar is fucked, as is the entire US IT/cloud industry.  I don&#x27;t believe in Lavabit&#x27;s &quot;keys are protected&quot; argument -- the court presumes LEAs are trustworthy, and will accept just restrictions in policy on what they can do <i>with</i> keys.

But, again, it&#x27;s more than obvious to everyone that it&#x27;s not what was expected/demanded from him.</i><p>No, it really isn&#x27;t.  This is precisely why interactions between the law and technology are often quite confusing, because there&#x27;s a mismatch between what the law says and the technological reality.  It wasn&#x27;t obvious what the law was demanding of him because such demands are rare and judges haven&#x27;t figured out a boilerplate form of words to ask for the surrender of PGP keys or SSL certificates in particular file formats yet, and so they ask in general terms for &#x27;encryption keys&#x27;, leaving much open to interpretation.  The existence of such ambiguities is why lawyers earn as much money as they do.<p>Levison wasn&#x27;t &#x27;fooling&#x27; the law at any point - he complied with the request as presented to him.  The FBI wasn&#x27;t happy with that response and went back to the judge for a more tightly-worded request, backed up by a threat of fines.  At no point was the legal process subverted, &#x27;hacked&#x27; or &#x27;fooled&#x27;.<p>My point is that <i>this is how the law works</i>.  If a judge wants you to do something then it is incumbent upon the judge to specify clearly what that is.  You can&#x27;t <i>refuse</i> without facing legal sanctions, but if the judge is vague or imprecise then you have at least some freedom to interpret the judge&#x27;s instructions yourself.  As I said earlier, corporate and government lawyers are experts in finding the most favourable interpretation of judicial rulings for their clients, and many legal cases revolve around reaching an interpretation of the law that is unambiguous enough to be enforceable.<p><i>Because it&#x27;s related to Snowden. Again, it&#x27;s quite obvious to everyone, that it&#x27;s a hot issue and the government might go far to solve it.<p>Like it was said above, while I really support and respect Levison, it&#x27;s not something you should be trying to fool - it&#x27;s not a computer program...</i><p>What are you trying to say here?  Sure, the government cares a lot about this case.  But the judiciary and the government are not the same thing, and the law, as a matter of principle, is meant to apply equally in all cases.  There are no special cases where the law should be applied differently because the case has the attention of senior government officials.  You might say that I am being somewhat naive in that belief, but I think that most judges would agree that their role is as neutral arbiters of the law, not agents of the government of the day.<p>There is absolutely no sense in which it&#x27;s possible to describe Levison&#x27;s actions as incorrect.  You can believe that he should have surrendered the keys in electronic format immediately, despite not being asked to do so, or you believe that he should have refused point blank to disclose them and thus disobey the judicial order, but those options are variously immoral or illegal, and the action of providing the printed copies of the keys was neither.",1380806991

Despite what&#x27;s been said here a full tank of gasoline is far safer than a fully charged battery pack with enough energy to go 300 miles.  Before anyone mauls me, consider how many gasoline cars have been driven and, yes, crashed, world-wide since gasoline cars came into mass production.  There have probably been millions of accidents without fires, even with fuel leaks.  There&#x27;s probably no imaginable way to compare the two at this time.  We simply don&#x27;t have enough data.  And, no, linking to a horrible crash video on youtube involving gasoline igniting does absolutley nothing to support arguments on either side.<p>The one issue with electrics that is not spoken of is the fact that you have a several hundred volt high energy system that could very well electrocute passengers.  I fully expect that to happen one day (in general, not necessarily Tesla).  If and when that happens you can bet it will set the breaks on electrics for a while and relevant stocks will plummet.<p>I still believe electric cars are the future.  We simply need to go though the evolutionary process that will make them really safe for hundreds of millions of electrics to share the road.  What happens when you have a pile-up of ten or twenty electric cars on a fogg-covered highway?  A pile of mangled wrecks with 400 Volt high energy systems is unimaginably dangerous.  I can think of a few horrific scenarios under those conditions.<p>At some level part of me thinks that fuel cells are the future, not batteries.

It takes more effort than I have on half of the days out of the year to release things into the wild[1]. I need a co-founder that complements me in this aspect, someone who is very good at pushing things out in front of people and getting attention for it. If I were to pick up another technical person, we&#x27;d just do the same things I&#x27;m already doing: making things without releasing.<p>I&#x27;m an artist, I can be very creative when it comes to procrastinating important, administrative tasks, i.e. paying taxes and such. I need someone[2] to push me, prod me, maybe even just do it for me. Another technical cofounder isn&#x27;t going to pick up that slack, they&#x27;ll want to work on code.<p>And if I take any of these people on as partners, the only way the project wins is if they&#x27;re in it for the long haul, if they are as dedicated to it as I am.<p>So there you go, a very tall order: find someone who does not share your skills but has their own that can help you (so has an increased likelihood that they are not in your social circles[3]), and is committed to the project in the same way you are (this is a slog, just try people out and dump them if they don&#x27;t work, no hard feelings, just move on). As with all issues of luck, it&#x27;s about perseverance and riding the waves as they come in.<p>But the difficulty of finding that person/those people doesn&#x27;t mean you stop working.<p>[1] I pay the bills with consulting gigs, so my clients force me to release on that stuff. Also, I&#x27;m forcing myself to learn how to build a blogging followership, as an education in marketing.<p>[2] Not necessarily a cofounder, but an accountant can be expensive. So, I&#x27;m paying an accountant for the big things and trying to get better about not procrastinating. &quot;Trying&quot; means &quot;attending coaching sessions&quot;, not &quot;talking about trying&quot;.<p>[3] So I&#x27;m forcing myself to socialize with non-technical people. I&#x27;m not going to any more programmer meetups. I&#x27;m instead going to things like CreativeMorning, or just chatting up the local business owners who run their own shops. Really though, the 6-degrees-of-separation rule applies, and it&#x27;s really more like 4.

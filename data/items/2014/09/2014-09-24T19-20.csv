Taking the time to make a small PR that makes a tiny improvement:<p>- shows you care about improving the project; you took the time to improve something small that others would ignore<p>- lets you test the waters. Are the project owners receptive of changes? Is it pleasant trying to contribute to the project? Or do they ignore your patch and don&#x27;t reply for 2 weeks. You wouldn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of effort just to find that out.<p>- gives you a chance to become familiar with the process, the tools, gain practice, and hopefully get rewarded with your change being accepted<p>For example, my first CL to Go was a trivial change:<p><a href=""https://codereview.appspot.com/97280043/patch/40001/50001"" rel=""nofollow"">https://codereview.appspot.com/97280043/patch/40001/50001</a><p>But without having done that (and having a good experience) I couldn&#x27;t have been working on more complicated changes like <a href=""https://codereview.appspot.com/142360043/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://codereview.appspot.com/142360043/</a> now.",1411588795

8363757,comment,8361101,8361101,2,0,Mikeb85,,,"While this is interesting, it&#x27;s pretty much useless.  Traders can do the basic maths in their head, in a split second.  If they can&#x27;t, they have no chance of making sense of any sort of financial numbers and indicators.<p>Furthermore, the price of the stock doesn&#x27;t really matter for anything above a penny stock.  100 shares at $25 is the same as 10 shares at $250, all else equal (for instance, market cap).<p>I also think larger positions are better, for instance $10K per trade is a good number.  It&#x27;s high enough that commissions are trivial, so you can make money off a 1-2% swing, rather than needing to make 3-4%.  Of course, the ideal is 5-10% (well, more is ideal, but 5-10% is a realistic enough number for a short time frame, say a week or two), but it&#x27;s nice to exit out of a trade that turned against you and still take a small profit at the end.<p>And of course, this app ignores the most important part - picking and timing stocks.  Some understanding of technical analysis as well as sentiment is required, and basic market dynamics (supply vs. demand, volume, etc...).",1411588784

8363755,comment,8359107,8361948,1,0,e12e,,,"> A few hundred thousand by an individual is literally a rounding error to tax revenue.<p>Which is why I said: &quot;All that said, if you sneak away a million US or so, go for it. It makes no difference what any one individual does as such(...)&quot;.<p>> (...)  it&#x27;s a fact that a large number of very profitable companies have avoided hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes over recent years. (...) Take your tax crusade to Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and the rest of the billion dollar club who are stealing your precious taxes by the hundreds of billions.<p>Doing one does not preclude the other. If a company destroys wetlands by dumping chemical waste, that does not make it ok for an individual to destroy a small grove by doing the same.<p>What I probably failed to get across is that my main point is that I don&#x27;t think it is OK to dodge taxes; I&#x27;m fully aware that pretty much anything any one individual does becomes a rounding error compared to what a big corporation does. But corporations are made up of people, and those people are guided by among other things prevailing sentiment. So the young whipper-snapper that starts out by dodging some taxes today, might think little of dodging billions in the capacity as CFO in thirty years.",1411588749

Now &quot;no one cares&quot;...and I am &quot;too old and set in my ways&quot;.  Which is it?  Both?  Does my age matter or not?  Both again?<p>Hint:  if your conclusion remains the same, but your reasons for that conclusion are this inconsistent, then your conclusions is almost certainly not supported by those reasons.  In the words of Popper, an &quot;immunized&quot; theory, meaning it is immune to falsification by empirical evidence.<p>Anyway, as you gain experience, you will probably appreciate the wisdom of domain modeling.  Or remain ignorant.  Not sure how the GoF Pattern book got into this discussion, but note that it is largely a description of workarounds for non-dynamic OO languages.<p>The 6x slower performance was relevant for &quot;Data Parallel Haskell&quot;, because performance is pretty much the only reason for doing that sort of parallelism in the first place, as I explained.  HPC was relevant because they had been doing the thing that was claimed &quot;impossible&quot; by SPJ in languages not like Haskell...in FORTRAN (which I hope we can agree is not all that much like Haskell).<p>Had you paid attention, you would have noticed that I use functional techniques when appropriate.  I just don&#x27;t buy the inflated claims, which have been consistently inflated and consistently unsupported by evidence for well over 2 decades now ... and object to arrogant ignorance such as that which you have amply displayed and continue to display.<p>To call HOM derivative is not exactly a deep insight, when I very specifically told you that it was derivative (and the papers are also very clear about that).  However, you display fundamental misunderstanding of not just HOM (which could be forgiven), but also OOP and FP:   HOM is exactly <i>not</i> &quot;function composition&quot;.  OOP languages have had higher order <i>functions</i> (&quot;blocks&quot; in Smalltalk) for decades, and these can be and have been composed quite easily.  The point of HOM is that the first order mechanism in an OOPL is messaging, so having functions as the higher order mechanism is inconsistent.  HOM creates a HO mechanism that is based on messaging instead of functions, hence HOM.  Actors are an unrelated concept.",1411588608

Getting that 50 MBytes/sec data down a 19.2k bits/sec channel was a challenge<p>Surely you would do the processing for target extraction on the radar&#x27;s side of that link, and send much less frequent samples from the estimated track over the slow link? Tracking on scanning radars can be tricky, but I suspect that would something so big and so slow the processing would be quite simple. It&#x27;s also a bit surprising that ports don&#x27;t do this with secondary radar (like airports do). Using the ship&#x27;s signals with PCL or similar technology would definately be feasible.<p>Radar is a technology with great promise.

For something so basic and important you&#x27;d think a good amount of testing and bugfixing should happen before that. We are taking our time with btrfs and Wayland, so why the rush with systemd?

It feels wrong to not have a single, authoritative data format at any given instant. If the idea is to change the column type, why not just `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN` instead of `ALTER TABLE ... ADD`?<p>But if you think about it, excepting trivial cases, once you&#x27;re migrating data, there are parallel realities at least for the duration of the migration and deployment. It&#x27;s not a question of whether you create divergence by versioning/staging (in some fashion) your data. It&#x27;s a question of whether you manage the divergence and convergence of the parallel realities that already exist as part of a migration. If you don&#x27;t, you either incur downtime or risk data corruption.<p>One big win here is that, by being disciplined about your code and data changes, you can cleanly separate <i>deployment</i> from <i>release</i>. You can deploy a feature but have it disabled or only enabled for a subset of users.

Not by government, not by companies, but by people making donations. It doesn&#x27;t come from the existing funding institutions because they almost never fund anything that hasn&#x27;t already had its prototype and early stage research completed successfully. If you don&#x27;t have your proof of concept you are not getting funded, and the institutions don&#x27;t really care about where the starting point of the pipeline actually comes from. Every lab scrapes out funding from the corners of existing grants and petitions patrons to conduct what is arguably their most important work, which is to say the actual work of taking risks and creating new things.<p>What most people call research grants are nothing of the sort.

Releasing without a patent means expanded access to drugs in countries that can&#x27;t afford extensive licensing and export agreements.&quot;)<p>But you and I both know that is not how drug development works. When you bring in a pharmaceutical company to fund the clinical trials (which are hugely risky) they will demand an upside. The upside will come if they (a) make a derivative molecule that they can patent (b) patent a use of the drug for an indication (c) package the molecule in a way that is patentable -- e.g. with an adjuvant.<p>The crowdsourcing page on Indysci reads as if the drug will eventually be cheap and readily accessible just because you have not applied for patent protection.<p>Another point: the indysci page misleads people about what drug patents means by comparing it to open-source software. As an academic researcher, you can work on ANY molecule, no matter its patent status, in an academic research setting. That means you can develop new uses for the molecule, make derivatives, etc. What you really mean is that patented drugs cannot be SOLD by anyone other than the manufacturer.",1411587305

Take for instance the perpetual &quot;monolithic architecture&quot; argument. <i>What</i> monolithic architecture? Systemd is in fact highly modular. For instance, PID 1 concerns itself with starting and monitoring units, and not much more. Other functions are implemented in other programs, such as journald, udevd, logind and so on. Of course, some of the components sometimes need to talk to each other, but generally via well-defined (D-Bus) interfaces - e.g., pam_systemd registers user sessions with logind via a D-Bus call, and loginctl asks logind about current user sessions, also via a D-Bus call. What&#x27;s wrong about that architecture?<p>Now, systemd the <i>package</i> is getting pretty bloated. For instance, there is no reason why stuff like networkd couldn&#x27;t be in a separate package that depends on systemd. But that&#x27;s not really an architectural issue, and not much of a problem for users. (For instance, you can disable networkd just fine.)",1411587138

A popular view is homesteading, which says that you own land once you improve it/mix your labor with it. I think there&#x27;s some subtle variations in the view with respect to things like whether you own the land itself or just the improvements to it or things like that.

Constructed houses and the like can be owned and people can have rights to these houses but not to the land itself.<p>> The notion of perpetual ownership of any finite resource is antithetical to the principles of the free-market, because it allows one to purchase an infinite amount of something (i.e. perpetual rights to a piece of land, including perpetual rent collection) for a finite sum.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re trying to say here.

Cheaper, too.<p>It&#x27;s not &quot;easy&quot; or &quot;more pleasant&quot; if you&#x27;re stressed for time.<p>Most of the article&#x27;s paragaphs focus on <i>techniques</i> or <i>process</i>.  It&#x27;s as if they assume the reader is afraid of pots & pans.  Or they think the complexity of combining ingredients paralyzes the reader with PTSD from high school chemistry exams.<p>The main roadblock isn&#x27;t ignorance of techniques or lack of recipes.  (Those are available with a few clicks of youtube or google.)  The issue is <i>available time</i>.<p>We can read these cooking manifestos and all nod in agreement because the benefits make logical sense but the real issue is that the cookbooks and essays don&#x27;t magically conjure up a nanny to pick up our kid from daycare so we can multitask the chopping of veggies and stir the tomato sauce.  Or we&#x27;re young unmarried 20-something and we&#x27;re working 60+ hours a week to meet a deadline with no time slot to cook from scratch.  (Sounds like those google catered meals makes a lot of sense for programmer productivity.)<p>By my personal estimates, home cooking requires 4x to 5x more time than ordering prepared meals (fast food or Whole Foods deli takeout.)  It takes a significant amount of time to home cook even if you stick to those simple &quot;cook in 30 minutes&quot; type of meals.  (Those 30 minute estimates never include shopping, meal planning, prep, and cleanup.)<p>One strategy to compromise between time and convenience is to cook a bulk supply of a meal (say big pot of quinoa) on Sunday and then eat it as leftovers for the rest of the week.  It&#x27;s a great idea to batch the prep & cleanup on Sunday and leave Monday-Saturday simply as microwave reheating days.  The problem with that is many folks are turned off by eating the same thing every day.<p>Perhaps with all this trend around &quot;sharing economy&quot; like Uber, a web service can bring together the folks who have time to cook with the folks who don&#x27;t that all live within very close proximity to each other.  A web 2.0 manifestation of comparative advantage in economics.  A handful of &quot;home chefs&quot; in the apt or condo complex shops and makes the meals while others pay for their portion.  This may not work for suburban neighborhoods because getting in a car or walking 10 blocks can be too much friction (distance, raining, etc).",1411585494

8363442,comment,8363197,8363359,2,0,sqrt17,,,"To people in Europe (no idea if grandparent belongs to these), mailing around checks is just a ludicruous idea.<p>You whip out your strong-authentication-of-the-day device, do the magic bellydance (i.e., enter some numbers into that device, or scan something on the screen) and whoop, you just transfered a sum of money. To someone in a different European (SEPA) country. Without paying anything (except if you live in Italy and have a greedy bank). With the money coming in within two business days at their side.<p>And of <i>course</i> you have an option to perform monthly payments that way. Some landlords put it in the rent contract that the tenant has to use this method.<p>France was one of the last country to abandon checks. Why? Because everything is more efficient when it&#x27;s electronic, and there is less forgery. (You can still send a wire transform via mail with a forged signature, but with these, you can usually go to the recipient and give them a hard time, which is harder with a check someone cashed out two days ago).",1411585399

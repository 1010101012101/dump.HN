I recent wrote an article about this phenomenon and what to do about it. [1]<p>For example, it can be demeaning to OSS developers who have spent much of their time (often unpaid) to build this software for you to use, when you open your bug report with the attitude that it must be broken simply because it doesn't do what you want it to do.<p>I prefer to start every conversation (bug report, etc), not with the purpose of fixing something that's broken, but to expand the both project's applicability and the community's understanding of the project. For example, consider<p><pre><code>    This software is broken on IE.\n</code></pre>\nvs<p><pre><code>    Can we make this software work in IE?\n</code></pre>\nYou're not starting a conversation because the software is broken in IE, you're starting it because it's an opportunity to make it applicable to the IE use-case.<p>This is also why I encourage everyone who's having trouble with any of my projects to <i></i>open an issue ticket<i></i>. I often get emails or tweets from people asking for help with some problem, and the first thing I tell them is, open a ticket. Their aversion to opening a ticket is because they're not sure if it's an issue with the software, or if they're just doing it wrong. But I say it's ticket-worthy either way, because a ticket isn't made to fix broken software, it's made to increase the project's applicability <i>and the community's understanding of the software</i>. If you're having the problem, chances are someone else is or will have that same problem, and now they can find the solution.",1322672097

Maybe his particular business would fair better there but again this the exception and not the rule.<p>There are other countries like China and India that have exploding GDP but the great thing about the U.S. is that while we are decently regulated those regulations don't do much to Hirt the founding of a business and allow businesses to expand easily. For example, India until recently has been chock full of mom and pop shops but not many larger, expanding businesses. This is because they didn't allow you to open a store in more than 2 location until just recently. That means no corporate franchises and the like.

3295433,comment,3294840,3295313,7,0,exDM69,,,"Thanks for disagreeing with style!<p>Even if a novice reader is not familiar with C at a very deep level, it's not that different from other programming languages. You should be able to read C and grasp the basic concepts of storing objects in memory, because a lot of OpenGL is about storing stuff in memory and you have to think about pointer alignments and stuff like that.<p>And besides, if you're writing example applications for a book or a tutorial, you should probably stick to very simple C code anyways. The kind that anyone can read to some degree.<p>Please note that I did not advocate that the reader must write their own projects using C, even if the book examples are in C. They can pick any other language they feel comfortable in. Just be prepared to deal with binding libraries and windowing toolkits and all the little things that you need.<p>Programming the GPU is one of the most hostile programming environments out there. You might not have a debugger available and you can't even debug with prints, you have to deal with memory explictly, drivers are buggy and a small mistake in your program might crash your computer partially or fully or cause very unintended consequences. I would not recommend for a novice who can't deal with C code to go there. This is true whether you use C or not. Even with WebGL.<p>Most of the people who want to learn OpenGL, actually want to learn 3d graphics programming. Then it's actually better to take a 3d engine that deals with 3d models, lights and cameras and stay away from OpenGL, which is basically a very complicated way of drawing triangles very fast.<p>A lot of stuff you said about C being difficult in practice, libs that are broken, difficulty on setting up on Windows, etc are true. However, they don't really apply to using it as a language in programming examples in a book or a tutorial.",1322669036
3295432,comment,3285671,3294149,1,0,dpark,,,"1) Prohibition had nothing to do with replacing enforcement of laws with stricter laws. It was about passing a new law where none existed before, to take away a freedom. Your comparison makes no sense.<p>And I'm not saying we shouldn't enforce the law. I'm saying that the range of the allowed wiretaps should be narrow so that enforcement is feasible. And indeed, the range of legal wiretaps is actually not that broad. If we enforced the existing law, there would be fewer.<p>2) You have repeatedly said that we shouldn't be concerned about government privacy violations, that wiretaps are not a problem, that we have more privacy than we need, that we should trade privacy for other freedoms, that the government is efficient with less privacy. You may not have explicitly said ""I want more wiretaps"", but you've been arguing in favor of it quite clearly. This is not a straw man. If you don't like where your arguments lead, then maybe you should ask why you're making those arguments.<p>Your attempt to separate privacy from other freedoms and present them as a tradeoff is still unsound. I could likewise ask you whether you'd rather have freedom of speech or freedom from false arrest, and pretend that this is a legitimate tradeoff and that we need ""not to pay much attention to it and focus our very limited resources on what's really important"".",1322669034

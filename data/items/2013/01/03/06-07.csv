Or an Iranian flotilla?<p>What's running on Blogger, who's hosting your blog?<p>Sure, you can come back to me and say that some of those have examples of free software or <i>utilize</i> free software in some way; I noticed in particular that the trailer mentions a lot of the power grid runs <i>on</i> Linux. But I don't see ""Power Grid v2.0"" on Savannah, because the vast majority of planet Earth is built upon a proprietary model. To dispense with <i>all</i> of that and say that free software is the <i>only</i> way is an incredibly myopic view that focuses only upon the personal computer. The personal computer is not the only software in the universe -- not even close. To conquer proprietary software to benefit the personal computer, you're also dispensing with <i>millions</i>, perhaps <i>billions</i> or even <i>trillions</i> of man hours to build the life that we know today. For what? An ideal? It's ironic, too, because free software is built upon collaboration of the whole, but they can't dream of collaborating with the proprietary whole.<p>Let's give you the benefit of the doubt and say free software is the absolute best thing in the world. IPv6 might be the best Internet protocol in the world. There will be private networks using IPv4 until all of us are dust in the ground. Metric might be the best measurement system in the world. Americans and, to a lesser extent the British, will be using imperial units until all of us are dust in the ground. Momentum is a powerful force, and when we're talking about the mind-bogglingly enormous portfolio of human innovation that was <i>paid for</i> by proprietary organizations, that's a <i>huge fucking aircraft carrier</i> worth of momentum to stop on a dime.<p>What do you want, as a free software proponent? Do you want proprietary software gone? Okay, organize reinventing planet Earth. I've given you a small list to get started. You can't win on the personal computer alone. There will <i>always</i> be compromises. I'm saying you should compromise more. I guarantee you that Siemens is never going to wake up one day and say, ""gee, we should write that new SCADA controller using a completely free software model; there's no need to provide any competitive advantage to our company"". Shareholders would bust down the door in minutes. Companies have given you the life you know today because of the system given to us before you and I were even born. Maybe they're inherently evil; then, I pose to you the question, what is evil? Keeping my lights on with proprietary grid management might be evil. Shit, then, I like evil.<p>We have the system we have. Many of the world's economies are capitalist. You operate in the system you are given and take full advantage of it. If the world wasn't wired the way it was, perhaps you'd have a shot at the utopia that you're envisioning; really, I <i>do</i> see the benefit. I promise. I see the benefit of a world without violence, as well, but it's just <i>never</i> going to happen and we have to cope as well as we can. The only world without violence will be a world without living creatures.<p>I don't know if you can tell from this minor essay that I wrote to you (and, I apologize for drowning you in it), but people working together for the common good is the single most important thing to me as a person. It makes me feel horrible that humans default not to getting along. Life is really, really confusing and partisanship like this confuses me even more. I'll never understand why humans can't agree on the simplest things and do everything in their power to discredit and mock the other side, and it's something that tortures me as a human being on occasion. When I see Obama and Boehner go toe-to-toe on what should be a pretty simple governmental decision, and the full weight of rhetoric and disagreement gets thrown behind each side for <i>days</i> of our precious time, I just want to grab them and shake them and say ""we're all humans trying to figure out this existence together! Is this fight <i>really</i> worth it in the long run? <i>What have you gained?</i>""<p>I hope, after death, I get an answer. Otherwise, wow. What a weird existence.",1357195428

5001270,comment,5000328,5000328,5,0,aneth4,,,"Let me challenge some assumptions about gerrymandering. The most common misconception of gerrymandering is the assumption that close races are required for the voters to have a choice. While in current practice this may be true, the reason is due to other factors in our voting habits and electoral structure, not inherent in gerrymandering. The solution is not to get rid of gerrymandering, but to make other more fruitful changes to our electoral habits and systems. Gerrymandering is neither good nor bad.<p>Gerrymandering works by making certain districts overwhelming in a single party's favor, leaving few competitive districts. While this may sound like it undermines voter choice, that is not the case.<p>A district dominated by one party does in fact have a choice in their primaries. In fact voters there have a better choice than in competitive districts. Voters in a single party district get to focus on whether their representative precisely reflects their views rather than whether their party can win in the general election. Take for example a 90% Republican district. We know that this district will be representative of a swath of Republican voters - that's a good thing. Those voters can now focus on the more subtle leanings of their candidates during the primaries. Voters and primary candidates can openly debate about social conservatism and gun control, rather than what the small percentage of ""swing"" voters care about. Essentially, party factions become the choice, exactly what this country needs to evolve two parties that do not do a good job of representing the country. This is how I foresee democracy emerging in China, and is common from time to time, though not necessarily implemented to the voters advantage, in frequently defacto single party states, such as Mexico, Japan, and Canada.<p>Pushing the impact of our representative system into more subtle debates in a primary election is only a bad thing because our primary system has some fixable issues. Fewer voters participate in primary elections, and there are not enough primary challengers. Making primaries more competitive and getting voters more involved in the primaries of the gerrymandered districts would help, and this leverages the positive aspects of gerrymandering rather than wasting effort trying to ban the practice.<p>In some ways the issue should be self-correcting. The more guaranteed a district is for a given party, the more candidates should emerge in the primary, the more competitive the primary should be, and the more voters should care. This is because winning the primary is nearly as good as winning the general election.<p>Perhaps a better solution to competitive primaries is something similar to what is being tried in California - non-partisan primaries. These shift the more subtle intraparty distinctions in single party districts to the more widely attended general election where they should be. In the above-mentioned Republican district, the district would likely have two Republican candidates in the general election. Such a system does both a good job of representing the constituents and of providing voter choice. The impact is similar to what one gets in a proportional representation or many-party system.<p>The reverse of gerrymandering - engineering all highly competitive districts - also has major disadvantages, the largest being that every district has a choice between two distinct parties who could have radically different views. The winner of the election represents a slim majority, is chosen by a very small percentage of ""swing voters,"" and small changes in ""swing voter"" sentiment can lead to major changes in representation. While that may have the advantage of throwing the bums out quickly, it can also lead candidates to appeal to their bases and push for voter turnout rather than having substantive distinctions. Sounds familiar.<p>Conclusion? Stop being outraged about gerrymandering and practice some political Aikido. Push for active primaries and support legislation for non-partisan primaries. These actions don't require Supreme Court intervention or Constitutional amendments, are practical, and may have a better result than banning gerrymandering.",1357194634

For most purposes people do not want to store the extract time and date of their birthday in the original time zone. Apple do this, much to my annoyance - it means people's birthdays change as you move around our planet, and that doesn't align with how they work in the real world. If I'm born in Utah on 1/1/1980 it does not mean I celebrate my birthday on 31/12 when I'm in Australia.<p>The second usecase is recurring meetings, particularly with global participants. The mind bending case is where you have DST in some or all of the TZs. The only remotely correct thing you can do is keep the meeting at the same wall-clock time in the TZ of the meeting owner (9am meeting stays at 9am). Most apps don't, and there is no perfect answer  (consider a participant in a different TZ - the meeting changes to a possibly conflicting time).<p>Sometimes storing the absolute time/date is correct. Other times storing the original UTC offset, as well as the time in UTC is. But most of the time, yes, store it in UTC in whatever form you prefer.",1357194000

If you can, you have to keep ethnic groups together.  So, for instance, if you can put all of Chinatown together, you have to.<p>The political effect is kind of complicated.  On the one hand it gives members of those ethnic groups a chance to win office.  On the other hand it creates very safe districts.  Given the way the math works, creating very safe districts for your side leads to improving the odds that the other side will win more seats than their share of the popular vote.<p>Activists are very focused on the first effect and tend to ignore the second.  Furthermore politicians encourage this because they like safe seats.  But the math is inescapable - an effective electoral gerrymander is created by creating a modest number of ultra-safe seats for the other side, and many more safe but less extreme seats for your side.<p>So all black seats that guarantee black representation in Congress leads to seats that vote 80%+ for the Democrat which in turn leads to Republicans electing more than their share of the popular vote.",1357193891

It is treated as property and subject to tax if transferred from one entity to the next.  The catch is that you can only sue for a certain percent of the claimed value.  You can change the claimed value of your patent, but then you must pay a tax as if that was earned income.  You would have to be allowed to set your initial claimed value of the patent at whatever you wish.  Kinda the same way that when you start a corporation you can decide how many shares you have (like 1.000 or 10,000 or 1,000,000).  But once that is set you can't just change them around without registering the change with the state.<p>In theory it would punish people who transfer patents a lot, but have almost no affect on people who register or hold onto patents.

I'll give you a quote from the actual appellate opinion: ""To establish a dangerous probability of success, plaintiffs must as a threshold matter show that the browser market can be monopolized, i.e., that a hypothetical monopolist in that market could enjoy market power. This, in turn, requires plaintiffs (1) to define the relevant market and (2) to demonstrate that substantial barriers to entry protect that market. Because plaintiffs have not carried their burden on either prong, we reverse without remand.""<p>Naturally there is a context to that (and they didn't reverse everything the district court did, but some things) and you're invited to read the entire opinion if you're interested.[1] Incidentally, if there is one thing I've found Wikipedia to be <i>regularly</i> wrong or incomplete about, it's the content of court opinions.<p>Moreover, findings of fact are a distinct thing from conclusions of law. ""Findings of fact"" are usually decided by juries, but sometimes by trial judges when there is no jury, and it means deciding what actually happened, not deciding what the law is. For example, a finding of fact might be whether Microsoft did actually pressure OEMs not to bundle Netscape, but not whether or not having done that would be a violation of the antitrust laws, which would be a conclusion of law rather than a finding of fact.<p>(I should point out that we're having a nice theoretical discussion here and that this is not legal advice, and if you need legal advice you should consult an attorney.)<p>[1] Here is one freely available copy of the appellate opinion I found through Google: <a href=""http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/msdoj/msft_ruling.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/msdoj/msft_ruling.html</a>",1357193338

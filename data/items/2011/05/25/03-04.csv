I could see this having niche use among users that need a server for a match or just want to play for a day with some friends, but in both those cases users have seemingly better options. Serious gamers often have servers to practice on, so they wouldn't be in great need of this service. Casual gamers often prefer to just hop on to a public server instead of configuring their own. Maybe if a group needed a server for an event? But even then LAN servers might be the way to go.<p>The best use for this would probably be a one-time online event like a 24-hour marathon or something of that sort that unites a group of players rarely, but on a somewhat large and controlled scale.

Their tentative plan is to raise a series A round right at 1 year and growing out of the Bay Area after 1 year.<p>The plan is to keep 3 engineers for 18 months before hiring.<p>That said, they want to bring me on as one of the backend engineers to build v1 of the product. I'm 23, a year out of college with an impressive resume (Apple, Google, Microsoft). I'm currently making $85-90k at one of those three.<p>They're keeping 20% of the company for an employee options pool (with a decreasing amount of options being offered, as they bring more people on). My offer has been:<p>$80k salary -> 1.25% of 20% options pool<p>$70k salary -> 2.5% of 20% options pool<p>$60k salary -> 4% of 20% options pool<p>Keep in mind, those percentages are of 20%. Therefore, 4% of 20% is equivalent to 0.8% of the overall company. ($80k->.25%, $70k->.5%,$60k->.8% overall company equity)<p>And they want to work out of San Francisco, where I'd have to live.<p>With that whole picture... what are your feelings on their offer? Fair? Unfair? Things I should argue or watch out for?",1306293689
2582716,comment,2582163,2582600,12,0,felipe,,,"Ironically, his experience would be totally different in China itself, where the tenant regulations are non-existent in practice. I had to deal with a number of landlords in two different cities, and I have to say that his principle (""[...] that people will pay a premium for convenience and stability."") is absolutely not true in China. Landlords will go to great lengths to extract the maximum amount of profit to whoever they can get as renters. It doesn't really matter if the renter is good or bad, because the whole country is going through such a huge transformation that <i>nothing</i> is stable right now. Renters move in and out, new rules are changed or created very often, etc... You can be the best renter (and I think I'm a pretty good renter) and the landlords still are going to try to extract something from you. And I cannot really blame them -- They are businesspeople, and their apartments are investments in a highly volatile environment.<p>And I don't think it's even a cultural thing... Of course culture always play a role, but I think the issue is simply how the market is right now (i. e.: regulations, competition, instability).",1306293655

The truth is that Jpeg is actually a very poor format. Image artifact is very poor at low quality, and compression is very poor at high quality.

Our eyes are accustomed to poor web Jpeg quality but I think if something better comes along people will see it.<p>Also, given Opera and Chrome already support WebP, if Mozilla throws its weight behind it, I think Safari and IE will oblige in short order.

Note how Neocities is all subdomains.\n</code></pre>\nYes, Google is more sophisticated about how they derank web sites (I like to think that our small search engine, blekko.com, helped them see how poor their results had become on highly contested searches), but the spammers and the crooks have also upped their game such that many innocent sites get caught in the crossfire. (Google &quot;panda killed my web site&quot; for example). Not to mention the new trend of &#x27;negative SEO&#x27; where someone might script a neocities site creator that triggered one of Google&#x27;s anti-rank defenses and to destroy the organic rank of an otherwise pleasant web site.<p><pre><code>  > You&#x27;re also assuming that everybody wants to get\n  > search traffic. Everything on Facebook has a \n  > PageRank of NaN, and yet people still post. What \n  > if the whole point is to make pages about your \n  > pet cat, just because?\n</code></pre>\nActually I&#x27;m not making that assumption at all. Facebook pages have a NaN pagerank because facebook has a robots.txt that says &quot;don&#x27;t crawl us&quot; and legit search engines respect that. Facebook rightly presumes that you will see your friends content because of mechanisms they have in place to put it in front of your eyes. And I also think that people making a page about their pet cat, or their belief in UFOs or whatever is fine and neocities is great for that. I&#x27;m just saying that the bad actors won&#x27;t leave it alone for those people to play in it.<p><pre><code>  > Maybe an interesting strategy would be to make \n  > the whole site NOINDEX by default. Turning off\n  > NOINDEX could be a premium feature. (Of course\n  > this could fail utterly as the customers that \n  > Neocities wants probably don&#x27;t distinguish \n  > between URLs and search queries.)\n</code></pre>\nActually the same people who put their pet pictures up will probably not put meta tags in their HTML. The Neocities folks could put a robots.txt file that excluded search engines (like Facebook does) as well. But think through what you are saying.<p>The person you want to make this &quot;fun&quot; for is a non-technologist putting up a page about their cat, and for people who are looking for random pages about cats. Or perhaps relatives of that person who say &quot;Hey, Mindy put up a web site for her cat!&quot;, &quot;Oh really? What&#x27;s the address?&quot;, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, just Google &#x27;Mindys Many Cats&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Thats weird it doesn&#x27;t find it&quot;, &quot;Are you sure you spelled Mindy right?&quot;<p>You see that non-technical crowd has been trained that Google finds everything, and if it doesn&#x27;t find neocities websites then the neocities guys have to explain to Mindy why that is, which is going to be a complicated discussion because we&#x27;ve assumed for this discussion that Mindy is non-technical. Of course they could offer that as a pay service but that wouldn&#x27;t work to well either since Mindy isn&#x27;t going to put up a website for her cats and pay $1/month to do it.<p>So the neocities folks could curate the sites, and try to delete sites that are bad (they already do some of that) but that takes people and time. People + time == money, and for a free service money is hard to find. And then they say &quot;Hmm, I wonder if Yahoo shut down Geocities not because they were clueless but instead because they actually started to see what they had gotten into and now they were scared they couldn&#x27;t keep it going.&quot;<p>There is a whole bunch of &quot;web&quot; below the fun part.

This must be some academic nonsense based on sounds and disregarding other critical language features.<p>Let&#x27;s put aside the fact that Cantonese has among the most complex pronunciation systems in the world, with seven tones and both long and short versions of a number of sounds.  This is a language which has four different communication modes.  Here&#x27;s how weird Cantonese is.<p>1. Cantonese speakers <i>speak</i> in Cantonese.<p>2. Cantonese speakers <i>read and write</i> in a totally different language, namely Modern Chinese, which for all intents and purposes is Mandarin.<p>3. Cantonese speakers <i>read out loud</i> in Modern Chinese (Mandarin), but <i>pronounce</i> each of the characters with radically different Cantonese sounds.<p>4. For purposes of comic book dialogue, etc., it is possible to read and write <i>some Cantonese</i> using various co-opted Chinese characters.  But you can&#x27;t pronounce <i>all</i> of Cantonese this way: many words have no written form whatsoever.  This has resulted in a bizarre pidgin written form.  For example, one very common word (&quot;di1&quot; -- &quot;a few&quot;) is actually usually written as &quot;D&quot; rather than as a character.  Other characters are impossible to write in current fonts, or are also used in Modern Chinese but for different words than in Cantonese, and so you see Latin letters like &quot;o&quot; and &quot;a&quot; next to them to suggest a different meaning.<p>Mandarin weird my foot.",1372444627

In Canada, Crown Prosecutors are appointed and the position is meant to avoid becoming political. That doesn&#x27;t always happen, since becoming a CP is often a route to either become a judge (our judges are also appointed), or a politician, but I digress.<p>As another example, under Canadian law, if you&#x27;re charged with a crime, it starts with the police office involved &#x27;laying an information&#x27;. Basically, the police officer will draft a sworn summary of the case and present it to a Justice of the Peace. Then, the JP decides whether there is enough evidence to actually go forward. We don&#x27;t have the concept of a grand jury, nor do Crown Prosecutors necessarily have to be involved before a charge is formally brought upon the defendant.<p>As for paranoid suburbanites, we have more than our share, and for good reason. Some of our laws (ie - our Young Offenders Act) admittedly leave a little to be desired and some awfully bad people get to walk the streets. For example, my city has a number of extremely violent sex offenders (who the parole board has ruled at an extremely high risk to re-offend) walking around free.

That means you can use a single atom to represent two binary digits.</i> No, that&#x27;s not how that works...<p>A qubit represents a single bit, in its two possible states: 1 and 0. Alone, the qubit could hold the probabilities that the bit will be a 0 or a 1 when you observe it. But for a quantum computer to be cool, you have to include entanglement!<p>When 2 qubits are entangled, they represent the probabilities of <i>each</i> of the 4 possibilities: 00, 01, 10, 11. If you only had the probability of each bit separately, say 10%/90% and 40%/60%, then the state would just be the multiplication of the two values: 4% for 00, 6% for 01, 36% for 10, 54% for 11. And if the first bit&#x27;s probability changes, the second bit doesn&#x27;t change. A simple multiplication will give you the new answer.<p>But entanglement means the probabilities are dependent on the values of other bits :) So say: if the first is a 0, the second has a 90% chance of also being a 0. And if the first is 1, the second only has a 50% chance of being a 0 or a 1. So if the first has a 20% chance of being a 0, that gives us 18% for 00, 2% for 01, 40% for 10 and 40% for 11.  The values of the bits are linked to each other. It&#x27;s not limited to a simple linear percentage; it can get more complicated by running the bits through various gates. So if the first bit&#x27;s probability changes, you have to recalculate the new probabilities of B <i>given</i> A. That&#x27;s when it would take exponential time using a classical computer, but it&#x27;s all done instantaneously via entanglement.",1372443552

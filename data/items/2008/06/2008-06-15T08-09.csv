The constant lame attempts at humour made me skip a couple paragraphs because they were basically ""haha, lost another reader there LOL"".<p>There's a higher chance of bad writing on the internet than in a reasonably high-brow print paper or magazine. (or book) I guess when I encounter bad writing or annoying style, I'm more likely to skip it because I feel I'm wasting my time. There's better-written stuff out there with a higher information density.",1213519915

I know one founder of a ppc optimization service who outsourced his MySQL schema development to some folks in the former USSR a few years ago and then asked me to take a look at it when they were done.  The schema was reasonable for what he needed and it looked pretty easy to map directly to the PHP framework he was using.<p>The total cost to him was about $400.",1213518417

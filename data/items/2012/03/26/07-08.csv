3755571,comment,3754531,3754901,11,0,apenwarr,,,"I think it could be done.  The plugin itself is actually very clean code and doesn't need a lot of maintenance (well, someone has to update it to Access 2010, but that's probably not so bad).  The server is crazy because it has Wine+Access+X11+VNC+Flash.  Mostly the problem there is Access.  But because the plugin has already done the insane work of exporting an Access database structure as text (and incidentally, re-importing it), all you need is a replacement server.<p>The actual form layout files (now that they're in text form) are pretty straightforward.  Someone who really loves javascript + html5 could probably make this happen with a few months of work, at least for databases that don't get too fancy.  (And the users are actually willing to modify their apps to make them work; slightly modifying Access apps is okay, rewriting them on a new platform is not.)<p>It would probably be much less gross that way, but I just don't have enough patience left to try it.  I'd totally recommend it to a fresh hacker with some free time though :)",1332748171

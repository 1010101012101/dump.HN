From fields you can't fill out, to misaligned elements, to sites that simply refuse to work on anything older than IE 8, FF or Chrome.<p>In our own site development we spent twice as much time trying to use various ""tricks"" to get IE 7 & 8 to look exactly like it looks in FF or Chrome. Either they worked in 7 but not 8, or 8 but not 7, or if they did work, looked significantly degrades over the rendering in FF and Chrome. Drop shadows were a particular problem. But many elements on our site use gradients, and any of those elements with text were virtually unreadable once DXImageTransform got ahold of them. In the end, short of rebuilding the entire site with dozens of little images, we decided to treat it like we'd treat the same problem with a traditional desktop graphics app -- Level Of Detail.<p>Just like with a desktop app running on low end hardware, where you make things work by lowering resolutions, decreasing draw distance, lowering polygon count, turning off anti-aliasing, frame skipping, etc. We chose to offer a lower LOD to people using a low-end browser. The site fails gracefully to this lower LOD with all of the functionality still intact. A red box with rounded corners and a slight gradient simply becomes a red box.<p>As it turns out, this works also on other oddball browsers like Opera. The last version of Opera would successfully render our site with rounded corners, but no gradients. So they got that LOD. The new version renders everything.<p>There's nothing weird about it, or bad attitudy about it. IE simply represents a less capable platform that should be treated as such. Our philosophy is to spend our dev cycles making good software rather than trying to coax a black and white tv to show color.",1310410730

If you're going to set type, think like a typographer: The word should be pleasant to read, not make my head hurt.<p>They should decide which is more important -- the text, or the design elements like the hexagon -- and make one subordinate to the other. Set the text in a decent font and decorate with the design element, or embed small words inside a big design element as they did at the end -- I agree that the ""js"" part of the logo is very nice.

There is no one ruleset to rule them all.<p>I, myself, have written many rules that I personally would never apply to my own codebase, but perhaps someone else might. My belief is that the world can benefit from static analysis tools and that adoption will be faster if we focus on providing as many rules as possible even if some are (in my opinion) questionable.<p>So CSS-Lint can be configured to only enforce the rules you want. If a user can find 5-10 rules that they like, then it seems like a good idea to start using the tool, especially if the team is larger and less highly skilled. But it seems petty to me to lambast a project just because you disagree with the name. Yes the intent of CSS-Lint is something different than base Lint, but I can say from experience that people looking for static analysis tools often google for ""css lint"" or ""java lint"" before understanding that Lint is a product and Static Analysis is the general term.<p>To summarize: CSS-Lint is just a name and the product is aggressively marketed.

It originated on /b/ when women/girls would show post nude/revealing pictures of themselves, and then Anonymous (presumably male) posters would attempt to 'dox' them (hack their accounts; email their friends/family/school with the nude photos; etc). The 'white knights' were the guys that would defend them (e.g. warn them if they didn't know their images were on 4chan; login to a hacked account, change the password, and notify the owner so that other anonymous posters couldn't continue to 'have fun' with the account; etc). The stereotypical portrayal of internet 'white knights' are lonely geeks that can't get women who think that by defending them on the internet they might get laid (or at least a date/a kiss/etc). Obviously the stereotype is most likely far from the truth, and there's probably some overlap between what /b/ users call 'moral fags' and 'white knights.' Note, that the 'white knight' label is usually only used when someone of unknown gender (which is assumed to be male) is helping out someone that is known to be a female. I don't think the 'white knight' label would ever be applied to someone helping out a target that was known to be male.<p>edit: There's probably something on Know You Meme and/or Encyclopedia Dramatica about this that may (or may not) be more authoritative.",1310407872

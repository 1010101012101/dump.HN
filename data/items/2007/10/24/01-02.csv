Once I got a few projects under my belt (and did some freelance programming work in the area) I went online and started spamming all the resume sites. Then the gigs come to you. Ideally you want to move into a word-of-mouth situation, but sometimes it takes a bit to work up to that.",1193191038

71911,comment,71698,71698,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Good article. Let me try to generalize his main point a little further: <p>""Premature"" does not mean ""early in the project"" -- it means ""before you have hard data to justify the optimization"". The reason this guy's optimizations aren't premature is that he's implementing a game engine, a well-established class of program with well-known pitfalls. His hints <i>are</i> based on hard data -- data from earlier game engines, which he and his veteran colleagues have managed to acquire and digest.<p>In general, it's hard to use performance data from one software system to design optimizations for another -- the two projects must have similar platforms, design constraints, and architecture. But the programs this guy is talking about are all in the same family -- they're built in C++, constrained to run in real time and monitor interactions between hundreds of in-game objects, and descended from a long line of ancestors whose architecture has evolved step-by-step since the earliest days of game programming.

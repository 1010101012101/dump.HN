Isn't polyphasic considered a popular hoax? As far as I remember, mentioned in the presentation dr Wozniak actually believes it simply doesn't work. Also, I've read a few blogs of people who tried it and failed (some of them appeared on HN) and don't recall a single person that succeeded. Taking that into consideration it makes me feel sceptical towards this guide. Sure - some sleep patterns work for certain people and don't for other, but why include something that seems to work for noone?",1291114561

I think the typical approach with Emacs is to leave 1 instance open for a long period of time and just keep coming back to it. (This is what I do, anyway.) I don't think this is any worse in general than opening and closing the editor as needed, it's just different. Especially when you consider that you can run terminals/shells <i>within</i> Emacs, it's a completely inside-out workflow. Instead of:<p>1. do a bunch of stuff at the terminal<p>2. need to edit a file<p>3. open my editor<p>Once you've gotten to step 2 you're already in your editor!",1291114375

At the time of its acquisition by yahoo geocities was the 3rd most visited site on the web, and was publicly traded with a market cap very near what yahoo paid. At the time it looked like a sure bet to snag geocities, bring it under the Yahoo ad network umbrella and simply wait for the inevitable windfall from ad revenue tied to continued exponential traffic growth.<p>Unfortunately, Yahoo screwed up, they killed a lot of traffic by driving away users through unpopular terms of service changes and other silly changes. Meanwhile, the web was growing up and sprouting innumerable new free content hosting sites that were far better than geocities (blog hosting sites like blogspot being the prime example) while the cost of full service paid web-hosting was falling through the floor. At the same time the dot-com bubble burst and internet ad revenue dried up. Geocities found itself obsolete, unliked, and decidedly unprofitable.<p>In comparison, groupon looks positively questionable.

Presumably the 171m that's been invested in Groupon hasn't bought the whole company, only a proportion of it, so the investors only get that same proportion of the 5bn. For example if that 171m represents only 10% of Groupon's shares then the investors only get 500m back; a 3x return rather than a 30x return.",1291111988

Why not do some deeper analysis?
What process is using all that CPU? dropbox or apache?
Is this also an issue on *nix or os x?<p>I believe that the hacker mindset is about confronting problems given a toolset, and using said tools to come up with a solution. In no way is that reflected in this article. So you tried a new workflow, and it caused your CPU to spike. That is hardly newsworthy.",1291111790

Everything is borderline magic and incredibly overpowered up until the point that it just doesn't work. Many Star Trek episodes careen between negative to positive deus ex machinae until the plot is finally resolved. The fact that somehow out of this sludge good story writing can even occur is a marvel.<p>As to the ""Semantic Web"", it seems to have become this generation's AI future. In reality the semantic web is likely harder and far more limited than anyone has given credit. People have fallen victim to the same old confusion of computers and the human mind. Merely because computers are able to perform quite sophisticated and complex tasks does not mean that they will be capable of performing any and every thing a human mind can. Computer systems will likely work along lines of shockingly different characteristics to the human mind for some time to come. Furthermore, we should not be stacking the future on unproven and questionably useful panaceae. Remember when the future of the web was VRML? Remember when it was ""portals""? Predicting the future of the web more than a few years out is a sure fire way to lose a lot of money, time, and effort.",1291111771

If they're making $50m/month, given the profit margins (which must be high given that revs are 50% of inventory value which they don't even have to buy/manage/warehouse/distribute!) $5bn doesn't seem too bad. It's a solid multi-national brand with proven scalability, and I'm guessing Google see plenty of more room to expand: given that a large %age of the internet uses Google services, and given all that Google know about their users, they can efficiently and accurately market to a huge number of people. Plus that reach means they can easily defend against competition.<p>So yeah, I reckon this is a pretty solid deal for them.",1291111278

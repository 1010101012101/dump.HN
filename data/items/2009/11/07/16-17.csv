There's a huge value to learning a number of other languages and they will help you approach projects from different conceptual angles, but most important is the ability to approach a project.  You'll learn more about how things are really working under the hood and the limitations of your chosen language by building one substantial modular project in that time. Visual feedback is definitely hugely important too.  I couldn't agree more that working on it every day is essential, if you want to get great, code isn't a job, it's life. Just like learning Japanese, if you want to really internalize what you're learning, you have to immerse yourself.",1257613176

Hundreds of departments across dozens of businesses leads to a few dozen projects going on at once. Add in the maintenance of apps that are often 5-10 years old taking up a large chunk of those resources, and 100 developers isn't really all that many.<p>BFEA-wise, the technical challenges revolve around the intersections between the various projects - message queues, batch servers, databases, storage (and more storage). Proponents of independent teams tend to dismiss these challenges, resulting in an overall environment that is more expensive to implement and manage. (for example, sure, that obscure OSS project may be _perfect_ for the task, until the one guy that knows it leaves, and you have to pay someone top-dollar to ramp up on it)<p>To be fair, there's usually a lot of room for improvement, efficiency-wise.

928012,comment,927846,927846,0,0,Mz,,,"IQ tests come with a lot of social and cultural bias.  So, for example, immigrants tend to do more poorly and members of an outclass tend to do more poorly (for example, historically this meant Black Americans tended to test poorly).  I would think one thing going on here is a kind of harm to the social orientation of the test-taker.  If everyone ""hates"" you, what's your motivation for being ""agreeable""?  And if your answers stop ""agreeing"" with what is socially valued, your test score can be hurt.<p>Does this mean you are dumber? Not necessarily.  It's common for extremely intelligent children to test poorly because they are unable to gear their answers towards the test's expectations.  One simple example:  A child may fail to classify the picture of a ""whale"" as a ""W"" word because they know the type of whale it is (such as ""Blue Whale"") and aren't sophisticated enough to know that the test makes the assumption that children of a certain age won't have such specific information.  A very socially savvy child may do better on such a test than a child whose interests are more ""technical"" (so to speak).  Anecdotally, very socially savvy and socially oriented kids of high IQ often do a wonderful job of hiding how smart they are in order to fit in better.  They may routinely shoot for roughly average even though they may be capable of substantially better performance than all their classmates.  If no one likes you or accepts you and there is no fixing that, why bother?  And if not bothering means you classify the ""blue whale"" as a B word instead of a W word because you feel that is more accurate and precise, your score may suffer.",1257611841

You have to get people to <i>believe</i> that they can (and should!) succeed, even once the opportunity is there, otherwise they might not try. [1]<p><i>Saying that if blacks get educated they can do better than non educated blacks, though not as well as non educated whites, is lunacy.</i><p>Worth pointing out that the numbers, though best for the white group, are not <i>as</i> bad as that.<p>For men and women, ages 25-44:<p><pre><code>            none     high school   college\n    white   17.5%     8.1%         3.7%\n    black   26.9%    14.0%         7.4% [2]\n</code></pre>\nSo, for each step up in education, the black person has a better chance than the white person on the level below. 26.9% is still a scary large number, though I'd like to think that the no-high school group is only a small proportion of the overall population.<p>(Also, yes, I've only been to the US a couple of times, but I'm not sure in which that affects my interpretation of these numbers.)<p>[1] Reminds me of the ""How to get women into CS"" discussion, I'm sure all the same arguments apply.

If you're hispanic/mixed/other and didn't finish high school, you've still got a better chance than a black person who did.

Imagine a large maze of (forgive the analogy) rats, some gray, some brown. The maze has bits of food and even material for shelter building. If all rats were released into the maze at the same time, all things being equal - physical sizes evenly distributed etc., each color of rat would survive equally as well. Now imagine releasing only the gray rats into the maze, holding the brown ones back, and imagine all these rats are intelligent - they can pass on information about the maze like where to find food to their offspring, so they become trained. Let's say you conducted this experiment over a long period of time, several years, and then one day you released the brown rats. You can see they would be at a disadvantage, even though they might have the same physical opportunity to the food and materials, the gray rats have ""set up shop"". Slaves in the U.S. were freed, but essentially just ""released"". (the 40 acres and a mule was never awarded) This is a crude analogy, but can show how such statistics can exist.",1257611152

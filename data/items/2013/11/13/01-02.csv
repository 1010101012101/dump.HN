The dialer app in iOS during those first few months was pretty buggy and had an occasional tendency to crash or lock up while on calls, especially when pressing the &quot;hang up&quot; button.  Every time it locked up on me, it&#x27;d never impact a call in progress though (much to my annoyance when trying to hang up).<p>It made perfect sense once I read that the speaker and mic were wired straight to the baseband, and the state of the dialer application had zilch to do with what was going on in the baseband.",1384307995

Denmark is currently discussing instituting modest co-pays for some non-emergency visits (currently there are no fees whatsoever, besides your tax contribution).

It is either sealed or it isn&#x27;t.<p>They&#x27;re trying hard to play up the amateur hour part, and that bit with the doctor&#x27;s &quot;I don&#x27;t recommend it&quot; where she lists the social aspects of food after she was holding an existing commercial meal replacement drink was pure sensationalism.<p>Even for an opinion piece, they could stand to be quite a bit more fair. The video said nothing of the bag puncture (only the mold), or the fact that the hand assembled soylent was a limited promo batch and not the final product.<p>Also, the clinical trial demand (something we require none of at the grocery store) at the end seems simply silly when he breaks his fast with FRIED CHICKEN, something for which we already have plenty of data to indicate that it&#x27;s bad for your body. You don&#x27;t get to say &quot;I&#x27;ll try it once it&#x27;s held to standards that I hold no other food to&quot; while eating things out of a deep fryer without looking like a total jackass.<p>It&#x27;s a smear piece.

Rails, nginx and other stuff that is used by developers generally has a higher chance of getting useful contributions and institutional support. People use this stuff professionally, if they run into a limitation, they contribute back for pragmatic reasons.<p>2. Firefox, Ubuntu and other open source consumer products are pretty hard to do with nothing but unpaid volunteers. Some projects pull it off (KDE comes to mind, although several distributions employ devs to work on it), but in general it seems pretty hard: Even if you find enough skilled developers, what about UX? What about design? What about marketing? What about PR? Would Firefox have made it in 2004 without the NYT ad?",1384307867

If you have cancer, you will seek treatment, regardless of the expense. The difference between $10,000 and $500,000 is not a factor when your life is on the line. In an inelastic situation, the market-based approach is silly (or even bad). Medical providers & insurance companies will move toward providing care at inflated prices.<p>And the left says: &quot;Health care is a human right.&quot; And they&#x27;re right.<p>BUT! this is important. Less serious medical conditions are much more elastic. If the price is $15, maybe you&#x27;ll go to the doctor for a hurt collar bone. If the price is $750, you wouldn&#x27;t. I didn&#x27;t.<p>And the right says: &quot;we can&#x27;t provide unlimited health care to everyone, it&#x27;s too expensive.&quot; And they&#x27;re right.<p>But we don&#x27;t _need_ to provide unlimited health care for everyone.<p>Care in a life-threatening situation (cancer, stroke, heart attack) should be considered a human right and subsidized by society. Care in any other situation should be considered &quot;elective&quot; and be subject to market conditions.<p>What do you think?<p>--\nEdit: there IS an upper bound to how much someone can pay for health care, obviously.

Debt is not about having to pay for things that we think the state should pay, its strictly about our consumption patterns.

Clojure/Script&#x27;s `let` for example is essentially the Identity Monad; and its `for` is very much akin to the List Monad (the same is true for list comprehensions in other languages).</i><p>I knew this from reading monad tutorials. And yes, certainly there exist useful things that happen to be monads. But I question the usefulness of explicitly pointing that out and saying, &quot;Here&#x27;s a monad library. I&#x27;m going to use this monad library to build X. You can use all the normal monadic functions on X, because it&#x27;s a monad&quot;, as opposed to putting the monad stuff to the side and just building X. What would you gain from building `let` or list comprehensions atop a monad library? Would it be worth the users you&#x27;d confuse?

Except, well, for performance.<p>One of the big differences between ASM.js an PNaCl is that ASM.js just exposes ordinary standardized Web APIs, while PNaCl gives you the Pepper API, which is basically an entirely Chrome specific API. That means that rather than just using Emscripten and compiling with two output targets (PNaCl and ASM.js) which call the same APIs, you need to do a wrapper layer on one or the other (emulating PNaCl with standard Web APIs, or vice versa, or having some other intermediate layer that abstracts over both). The whole point of ASM.js is to leverage existing standardized infrastructure, while PNaCl just exposes what&#x27;s convenient to expose in Chrome, while likely being considerably more expensive for other browser vendors to implement.<p>This is a lot like Filter Effects in IE. Rather than specifying a reasonably portable syntax, they defined something that was build specifically on some random subset of DirectX filters, and pretty much impossible to implement anywhere else without implementing a large amount of DirectX. While other browsers eventually released most of the same things in a portable manner, there was a while where you had to either implement both or use some kind of wrapper of one over the other.<p>While I think that it&#x27;s a good thing that Google has spent time experimenting with and building NaCl and PNaCl (in general, you need ad-hoc single engine experimental implementations that people can play around with in part to figure out what will actually work for authors and is actually implementable, like canvas was, or various CSS3 effects over the years), it&#x27;s a standardization dead end, and it would be nice if they would spend their effort on trying to extract something that could be standardized from it and ASM.js, rather than enabling it for web pages so it&#x27;ll become another single-vendor technology that leaves others as second-class citizens.<p>This kind of vendor lock in is out of line with promises of openness and supporting standards that Google has made in the past, and especially concerning since they&#x27;re selling hardware that only runs Chrome. Between locking people in to a single browser on that platform, and a single browser if they target PNaCl (with maybe second-class support for other browsers via Emscripten and pepper.js), this is starting to remind me of what a certain other company did when they had the sleek, fast new browser that was trouncing the big buggy slow incumbent.",1384306058

Slap me if I&#x27;m wrong.<p><pre><code>  // scope 1\n  var someClass = function() {};\n\n  function f() {\n    // scope 1, 2\n    var some = new someClass();\n    function unreachable() { some; /* scope 1, 2, 3 */ }\n    return function() { /* scope 1, 2, 4 */ };\n  }\n\n  window.f_ = f();\n</code></pre>\nBasically, any closures created within scope 2 will share the same parent scope in its scope chain rather than each closure having its own parent. That means any variable in scope 2 that&#x27;s captured by a child closure (3 or 4) will be included in the other child scopes.<p>In this case, `some` is captured in `unreachable()`, thus it&#x27;s going to be included in the returned function as well. The returned function is then retained with `window.f_`, and that&#x27;s the leak.<p>EDIT: for clarity.

Of course not, it&#x27;s likely made from cheap cuts of meat, but that&#x27;s what you do when you&#x27;re grinding it up for a burger.</i><p>I guess I don&#x27;t understand this point. I completely agree that the meat you get at the store is sometimes as bad as McDonald&#x27;s meat. McDonald&#x27;s was just an example I threw out because lots of people eat it, I don&#x27;t think they represent the evil center of all food or something. So I don&#x27;t really hold &quot;being available at the store&quot; in very high regards. I personally go out of my way to purchase grass fed and grass finished meat (meat just labeled grass fed is usually grain finished, defeating the purpose). You probably disagree with me as to what constitutes real meat (I don&#x27;t think antibiotic treated cows injected with hormones that don&#x27;t eat their natural diet are real, but you may), but at the very least you can hopefully see that my position is consistent.<p>To bring it full circle, I am <i>as suspicious</i> about meat treated this way as I am of soylent. And when I look at the ingredients in a big mac and the ingredients of soylent, I see a ton of red flags in the former and not the latter. This <i>does not mean</i> I think soylent is amazing and McDonald&#x27;s is terrible. It means I think neither is real food.<p><i>>Tomato sauce is made from tomatoes, a vegetable. Sure it has a lot of salt and sometimes HFCS in it, but it&#x27;s not &quot;artificial&quot;.</i><p>It seems the argument is increasingly just &quot;nothing is artificial as long as it can trace part of its makeup to something real&quot;. &quot;Meat is real meat as long as it comes from a cow, it doesn&#x27;t matter what went into the cow&quot;. &quot;Ketchup is real because a primary ingredient is tomato&quot;. Are strawberries dipped in chocolate with whip cream real food since its still &quot;basically strawberries with some HFCS&quot;?<p>...Sure I guess, but at that point my counter argument simply becomes &quot;well many of the ingredients of soylent also trace their ingredients to such things, thus I guess it still holds true that they are equally fake/real.&quot; Maybe here we simply have to agree to disagree, or at least accept that this has become a largely semantic argument between us. I don&#x27;t think taking a tomato, adding a ton of salt and HFCS, can be called &quot;real&quot; food with a straight face. Perhaps that is below your &quot;reality&quot; threshold however, which is fine.<p><i>> Do you consider homemade dill pickles to be &quot;artificial&quot; because of them amount of salt in them?</i><p>Well I certainly don&#x27;t think someone who eats home made cheesecake is eating real food. In other words, artificiality has nothing to do with whether its home-made or not. Where does a dill pickle fall? I don&#x27;t know, somewhere in the middle probably.<p>To sum up, if my doctor said &quot;eat more real food&quot;, I would not think I would be following his advice by going to McDonald&#x27;s.",1384305525

It isn&#x27;t the case that events like you describe (genocide, internment camps, the Holocaust) are inevitable or constant. Governments do these things, when they do, because governments are the only power structures capable of it -- one would have to prove that corporations given the same opportunity or power would somehow not engage in anything similar. Other governments also fight against them. The only difference between a company hiring Pinkertons to shoot striking miners and an army killing civilians is in scale, I don&#x27;t believe it says much about the implicit evil of government versus the implicit good of a free market.<p>Most of these events had some measure of popular support. Many people wanted to put the Japanese in camps. Many people wanted to rid Europe of Jews. A lot of Americans wanted the Iraq war, and a lot of Americans want prisons to be horrible, believing we&#x27;re a Christian nation and that a Christian nation should punish the wicked and smite the infidels.

Ensure has been used to replace meals for tons of sick people for 40 years; why do you think that a few computer geeks will be able to suddenly do better than 40 years of industrial research?<p>As far as the taste, it&#x27;s too soon to tell. Indications are that it&#x27;s pretty flavorless <a href=""http://gawker.com/we-drank-soylent-the-weird-food-of-the-future-510293401"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gawker.com/we-drank-soylent-the-weird-food-of-the-fut...</a> (outside of joking reactions like &quot;It was great and I love it. I don&#x27;t want to eat anymore.&quot;) Given that they aren&#x27;t particularly focusing on trying to make it taste good (&quot;I&#x27;m not trying to make something delicious; there are already a lot of delicious things. It&#x27;s all about efficiency, it&#x27;s about cost and convenience.&quot;), I doubt it will wind up tasting much better than Ensure.<p>I just don&#x27;t get all of the excitement over Soylent. It seems like a solution in search of a problem. It&#x27;s pretty damn easy to get a healthy diet for cheap and extremely low effort, as long as you don&#x27;t care about flavor and variety. Rice, beans, and grated cheese covers pretty much all of your nutritional needs (maybe toss in a multivitamin per day to be on the safe side), takes about 5 minutes of work and 15 minutes of waiting for it to simmer, you can prepare a week&#x27;s worth in advance and reheat it over the course of the week, and it will cost you less than $5 per day in the US. How is Soylent supposed to be so much better than that that it will &quot;disrupt the world food system&quot;?",1384304618

One of the smaller (but oldest) surviving black markets, Deepbay, apparently seized all bitcoins on deposit and stole them from its users a few days ago. Was it hacked? No, just the operator decided to cash out. Does this have something to do with Bitcoin tripling over the last month and additional competition from new black markets like Pandora and SR 2 and Tormarket? Probably...",1384304601

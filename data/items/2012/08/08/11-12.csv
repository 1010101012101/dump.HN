My understanding at this level is that while these lawyers may be working for you, they still owe a duty of care to only produce stuff that's of value to the court case. \nUnless your IP somehow involves the other side in some fashion, then that should be safe. But ""confidential"" documents showing how you modified your own product after a comparison with another product on the market is probably fair game.<p>What stops discovery escalating like you suppose is that there needs to be a basis for the court case, and that the lawyers looking at your documents have their own reputations to protect.",1344427162

One nice thing about HN is that it is rarely rewarded here.<p>You could have said:<p><i>People are hostile to that posting because it talks down to its readers by being a gigantic infographic. It could have been explained in a few paragraphs of text. Also, the idea appears to be made by people with a preference for form over function. Therefore it has little practical merit.</i><p>It would have made the same point, without the hostility or hyperbole.<p>Personally, I found the overall idea unrealistic, but it was interesting to see Wikipedia mocked up in another way.

I hope my cynicism isn't ruining the mood or setting a bad example or anything.<p>As far as that particular Wikipedia thing: I think a lot of people really liked the design, and most of them clicked the upvote.  On the other hand, most of the people who didn't like it couldn't downvote so they left comments instead.<p>So part of the hostility you notice might just be the fact that they took on Wikipedia and really put themselves out there, so it was a controversial post.  And HN needs to fix the downvote thing (there I go being negative again).<p>One other thing is that you have people with really different backgrounds coming to Hacker News.  Some people are like me and have a lot of coding experience including, for example, enterprise(y) application programming.  Other people have much more experience in marketing and/or graphic design and/or UX/UI.<p>This might just be another example of me having a bad life, but there also might actually be a bit of pent up resentment between UX/UI designer people and coders in general.  I will be too honest as usual and elaborate.<p>Basically, what it seems like from my own programmer perspective is that the people doing the software UI design in Photoshop or whatever think that they know better how to build software than me and therefore are placing themselves over me in the project decision making, even though they have written very little (or zero) code.  That sort of misplaced disrespect could possibly sometimes make a person feel righteously hostile.  Of course, I do realize that UX is its own field with knowledge that isn't automatically absorbed in the process of coding, but that doesn't really change the situation between coders and UX designers.",1344426762

4355039,comment,4351720,4351720,1,0,yourapostasy,,,"My tactic for winnowing non-technical potential founders who respect what you bring to the table versus those who likely do not is the following. I point out to them I am already engaged in my own company using my extensive technical background to successfully market and sell on my own, and am quite busy and happily successful, but could carve out the 10 or so hours per month to provide my expertise guiding their technical decisions as a board member, even helping them find technical founders who have the time to implement. I give them a quick ""taste"" by describing what kinds of technologies and APIs someone implementing their idea would need to be involved in, and after some quick Googling, their top 2-3 potential competitors in either the same or adjacent spaces, and key decisions that straddle the business-technical spectrums they will need to make that they haven't thought of yet that can dramatically impact the technical architectural decisions an implementor would have to subsequently make. If some numbers are available, I give them a development budget and time line ""rough sketch"", and tell them I can work up a set of potential MIRRs for their implemented product/service if they have some available numbers from potential customers. I describe that board members with this much due diligence before board meetings typically receive a 2% stake pre-seed, then step back.<p>In every case so far, they have gone radio silent, and months later I always find out that their ideas still go unimplemented, which does not surprise me. I believe an authentic counteroffer for a genuine board position (if you already have a track record that aligns with the counteroffer) is a positive and non-combative response. If they genuinely appreciate what you bring to a potential team, they would believe it fair to exchange 2% for that value, or at least they will start dickering. If on the other hand they are just looking for Work For Hire on the cheap, they'll move their pitch onto the next technical persone they run into.",1344426663

The reason is for the sake of simplicity they waive the per-transaction fee that Visa/Mastercard charges them and just charge a flat percentage of 2.75%. But even though this is a relatively high percentage, it's not enough to recoup the cost of the per-transaction fee at low transaction sizes.<p>Take a $2 coffee charged to a Visa credit card. Visa charges Square 1.76% + 6 cents, or 9.5 cents. But at 2.75% Square only collects 5.5 cents.<p>So even if Starbucks was already paying wholesale Visa/Mastercard rates, they'll save 4 cents or more a cup thanks to Square's ""simplicity subsidy"".<p>Now multiply that by a few billion cups.

There's a lot of stuff along the order of ""we've tucked stuff off in the border somewhere in a color that blends in, but we need to make it bright and put it in a noticeable position"" where the iPhone was a good example of UI done right but where the same overall direction could be had by looking at any number of other products (and not just phones either).<p>I've not read the whole thing, but I've not seen any clear examples where they've had lots of choice in how to make things better without making things more similar to the iPhone.

4354925,comment,4352290,4352527,5,0,hellerbarde,,,"The homepage of _Wikipedia_ is WWW.wikipedia.org. They never said they only want to target the english Wikipedia. The Frontpage of the _German_ Wikipedia is DE.wikipedia.org, but that has nothing to do with the article.<p>The individual language front pages are still here. With loads of information density and featured articles and everything.<p>The beautiful front page for searches in different languages is very nice and certainly provides better overview over the different languages available.<p>The overhaul of the Editor is also a nice addition, although it should probably be coded in a way as to enforce adherence to templates. A challenge you say? Maybe. But most things worth doing are.<p>The highlighting is a nice touch, certainly useful for doing research, which is what WP is often used for.<p>They did not confuse wikipedia with wikimedia. They very clearly proposed a specific logo for both Wikimedia and Wikipedia. They were aware of the connections and relationships between the organisations and concepts in question. The title can be construed as misleading, ""Wikipedia redesigned"" vs. ""Wikimedia redesigned"", I guess. But most people using WP are not acutely aware of the difference and relationship between the two. So they decided to hook the article on ""Wikipedia"" because it's the more recognized name. I have no problem with that.<p>I don't like that ""organic living logo"" idea either, I'll side with you on that one.<p>Yes, the capital J is a bit annoying :)<p>Your criticism seems mostly superficial and I don't quite understand why. A better branding does not water down the content. ""Doing something bigger than that"", (which i completely agree with) is not diagonally opposed to beautiful design.",1344423985

For startes it would have been nice to know why specific decisions were made instead of just ""we thought it was prettier"".<p>Maybe usability studies, A/B test results and if at all possible some form of prototype, even if it is just static.<p>Plus the article lacks consideration for mobile and small screen platform (i.e. considering edge cases).

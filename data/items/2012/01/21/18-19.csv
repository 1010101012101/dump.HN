But in reality any low cost service will have bad customer support (Gmail customer support anyone?).<p>Also, take into account the fact that Paypal has millions of users, so even a 1:million horror story rate will explode into thousands, whereas for these new startups, I doubt they even have a million customers.<p>Yes, their customer support is stubborn, paranoid, and OCD.  They might even sneer at you, but learning to work with them may be one of the best paying skills to have if you're processing volume.<p>Also, I give paypal credit for taking almost everyone under their wings.  Half the people using paypal couldn't get a merchant account with any real reputable bank.  They have paranoid security because their standards are so low.<p>And of course on the other side, if you're willing to give up a percent or two for being treated kind and by the ""right people"" then of course these startups will probably suit your need better.",1327172330

3494259,comment,3493377,3493682,1,0,forkandwait,,,"Kingsley Davis spoke of a ""multiphasic response"" that each society does to keep its population balanced (it doesn't always work, but it does happen).  Right now, Japan and Europe don't feel they are so close to crisis that they are willing to really do what is necessary to increase fertility -- lots of government support for mothers, lots of propaganda, negative sanctions against those people who don't have families.  ""Traditional"" (high mortality high fertility -- ""pre-transition"" -- societies have always had these pushes in place).  Right now there is a little bit of govt support and a little bit of propaganada. But they will when they feel like they are in a crisis (esp Japan -- you watch...), and it may or may not be too late.<p>Low fertility is a dynamic that nobody has had widespread experience with, so we don't really know what to expect.  We also still have plenty of people on the planet, so a population decrease of 50% might actually be a good thing at the bigger scale.<p>I am surprised at Rand, if it is as simplistic a report as the comments say (sorry, not reading -- I live and breathe this stuff).

It could either work with the music industry and help make their process cheaper, or it could even replace it if it ever became popular enough to be used by main stream artists.  This idea is the reason I started teaching myself some web dev stuff about a year ago.  About 6 months ago I got a job at a somewhat small but completely awesome start up.  My thought is that within about a year I'll understand the full stack enough to make a prototype for me and my friends, but for this idea (which has been tried before, but failed) to work I think it has to be slow growing.<p>If some of you guys come up with some baller distribution software in the meantime, that would be awesome, but if you want to kill the music industry you've gotta go way deeper than music distribution.  This article is interesting, but I think it's only thinking about the problem in a superficial way, folding already existing technologies into the strategy.  This is the internet guys.  It's brand new.  There are so many great possibilities that haven't been realized yet that it's almost insane to do something that someone else has done before.  Sound Cloud allows people to share their own music, that's a good start and as far as I can tell they're doing well with it.  I kinda feel like people here are arguing for a slightly different version of that.  In my mind, that's wasting time.    I have my idea, but I'll bet some of you can develop a different or maybe even similar but better one if you push yourselves so I don't wanna taint the idea pool with my specific plan.<p>If your idea is to take an existing structure and make it more social or something, that's an ok idea but it's not very innovative.  You should think about what is not being done with music and artists at all right now.  Then go with that.  New is good, and exciting and on the internet it's easy to convince people to spend a few minutes checking it out.  Then it's just gotta be cool enough to convince them to stay and signup.<p>Another good strategy is to take something that exists right now in the real world, that people are familiar with, and make an online version.  There are so many possibilities to do this right now that it seems silly to me that companies like google try to create their own social network.  Although I get the appeal of owning all of that freely given demographic information.<p>Anyway, just some ramblings.  I'm obviously new to this stuff so maybe I'm retarded.

So outcome isn't purely a function of past experience.<p>But let's take a group of people who have the same experience in a domain.  Then I would define resourcefulness as the component of outcome that depends on the person, specifically how much self-drive the person has, and how much the person can leverage the tools in his or her situation.<p>Resourcefulness, as define this way, I think is some part skill.  You have to be intelligent enough to put the match and sandpaper together to start a fire.  Part of it is tolerance for being burned -- it's much harder to cold call a VC if to you it's personally painful to be told to shove off.

Resourcefulness is inherently related to schlepp and you won't schlepp unless you really, really, care about the problem.<p>Basically, I think you're right in that some situations really benefit those who've seen it before.

While the quality and freshness has dropped off somewhat in the last year or so, it remains a great source of insight and reporting into economics.<p>I don't think that the reporters on this piece were trying to give us any sort of message, other than that China realized that communism -- that is, government ownership and regulation of production, and equal pay no matter how hard you work -- was a failure, and that they had to somehow escape from that system and move toward a more capitalistic one.  How that happened is an interesting story, and an important one.<p>If you think that Planet Money is against communism and in favor of capitalism, then that's probably a safe assumption.<p>But if you think that they're all rah-rah-USA! in their opinions, then you need to listen to the podcast more regularly.  They've done some excellent shows on Denmark (and particularly, now Danes are generally OK with taxes that are beyond the pale for all but the most extreme Americans) and education (and how the US isn't attacking that problem, particularly at the preschool level, an intelligent way).

I agree, and it may be a function of the kind of thinking style that lends itself well to engineering disciplines. The curricula I looked at for Engineers seemed to express an intense desire on the part of the schools to break their engineers <i>out</i> of this kind of mental slavery and to grok softer subjects as valid. Many people who want to become engineers do so because they've mentally dismissed the validity of subjects with non-binary outcomes. I think their is a need to put engineers through a well rounded curriculum that includes exposure to the arts. I think this is <i>very</i> important.<p>But it means as a side effect that they receive a non-trivial portion of a standard liberal arts education <i>on top</i> of the study of their own field. (In my opinion schools that don't provide this kind of education to their engineers are doing their students a great disservice.)",1327169220

3494131,comment,3493512,3494050,2,0,mkn,,,"<i>The stupidity of ideas like this is they are counterproductive. If your employees are 'shopping around' or seriously entertaining recruitment offers it likely means they are unhappy in your employ. In this case it is best for everyone for them to go elsewhere. You know how you retain good employees? By giving them challenging work, minimizing stupid bureaucratic taxes, avoiding silly office politics, paying them fairly and treating them with basic dignity and respect. What a concept.</i><p>It's probably not insightful to frame this problem, as you seem to have done, in terms of the naive ""markets are always best"" argument, especially when that model seems to imply that employees should always be ""shopping around,"" by definition. You say that ""it is best for everyone for [dissatisfied employees] to go elsewhere."" Where to begin? Specific persons in your employ aren't fungible. They've accumulated training and product knowledge that you might direly need in order to meet a deadline or bring a product to market before a competitor, to cite the most obvious objection. In other words, the cost/benefit ratio of retaining a given employee is dominated by factors external to the labor market.<p>I'd also be interested to hear, in detail, how your particular arrangement of challenging work, bureaucracy, office politics, fair pay, and dignity and respect programs both reaches a maximum of employee satisfaction <i>and</i> functions in even one competitive company. And then I'd like to hear how that generalizes, from first principles, to all technology companies everywhere. For example, how are you going to stop office politics from coming in to play during the distribution of challenging work, say in one of the ""schlep"" companies that pg wants to fund, all <i>while</i> minimizing ""stupid bureaucratic taxes."" And, which of bureaucracy or politics is going to be more generally erosive of ""basic dignity and respect,"" if you have to choose between them?<p>I mean, it sounds nice, from an employee's or prospective employee's perspective, to just say, ""Employers should just do only amazing things to me, or I'm within my rights to throw a fit and leave to go work for an obviously smarter employer,"" but that doesn't mean you've actually got a workable hypothesis.",1327169202

The countless docks and accessories for the iPhone also give you a lot of options.<p>The camera looks to be a worthwhile advantage for the 4S - the motion-stabilized video in particular really stand out and make video actually worth watching/sharing.<p>People dismiss this as pedantic, but iOS's app advantage is still worth noting.  GarageBand and iMovie are easily the most sophisticated mobile apps I've seen yet - Android equivalents (there really isn't one for GarageBand) aren't in the ballpark. If you're bored, $.99 will get you a <i>great</i> game optimized for the newest hardware like Scribblenauts or Shadowgun - Android looks to be at least a year behind.  There always seems to be an Instagram/Orchestra/Oink with no Android equivalent.<p>But how do you weigh that against a larger screen that looks far better for reading and video?  Similarly, this makes Android's already far superior Maps more useful.  And I could see ICS's live voice transcription being just as much of an advantage as Siri.  These are arguably more common use-cases than the Apple advantages I just listed.<p>All this to say that I <i>wish</i> it were an easy choice which were superior.",1321628063

It's like binary search. You cheated your way by knowing where _not to look_.<p>Another simple analogy: you can increase the value of rational number both by increasing the numerator and decreasing denominator. In this case you decreased denominator.<p>Monty Hall requires a slightly bigger leap of logic.<p>Actually, here's a more directly linked problem: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Prisoners_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Prisoners_problem</a>",1246625017

On the evenings of the 6th and 7th I need a hotel in New York that's not too expensive (by local rates), close enough to the subway (or other transport) to be able to get around, in a reasonably sane place, reasonably close to Penn station (if that's hard to get to by subway (which would be hard to believe)), clean, and quiet.<p>I, however, have next to no knowledge of the layout of New York, its stations, its facilities, its districts, or its dangers.  Yes, I can learn all of this from the web, but how long will it take?  My guess is hours to try to find a reasonable deal, which is therefore not worth finding because it has cost me more to drive to the gas station than it has saved on the price of the gas.<p>Someone with a very small amount of local knowledge could solve this for me with almost no work.  If someone were coming to my area I could give them near complete guidance in less than 5 minutes.<p>Is there a web service to do this?  I can go to hotel web sites, but that doesn't tell me about the situation, transport, area, or anything.<p>What would <i>you</i> do?",1322091232

On Friday afternoon a piece of news appeared that LivingSocial is about to raise a $200M round to strengthen its position as a competitor for Groupon. More recent rumours say that the round may actually be much higher than that, backed by some big names, and the cash would go to the company and not to investors (<a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2011/11/22/livingsocial-waiting-on-more-big-shoes-to-drop-to-close-round/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2011/11/22/livingsocial-...</a>). So this may have influenced investors mood to some degree, maybe enough to make a spark so to speak, which probably was the opportunity that short sellers were expecting to start making big bets. It's just an assumption, but it could make sense.<p>According to an earlier Reuters analysis, Groupon shares are very attractive for shorting because the company is losing money, had issues with accounting, unproven business model, and may face stiff competition (<a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/14/us-groupon-shortsellers-idUSTRE7AD2E820111114"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/14/us-groupon-shortse...</a>).",1322091059

For most of us, our niche is tech.  Patrick's niche is education.<p>In the tech/startup niche, often the extent of marketing that is required is posting to HN and getting featured by TechCrunch.  Trying to expand our niche outside of this is probably a bad sign, and most likely ineffective.  I hold this thread as a prime example of how much we hate advertising.<p>The education niche is quite different.  You don't reach them by getting coverage for raising a round of financing or writing a blog post on SEO that casually mentions your cloud based retro encabulator.  This ""deceptive"" marketing may be an effective way to raise interest in different segments of his target market.<p>Traditional online advertising is increasingly ineffective because of all the bad ads in that form.  Would we be so quick to ignore all ad-like content if we hadn't been tempered with the aversion therapy of flash horrors, scams, and weightloss/white teeth/work at home?  The end result is even advertising that might serve a useful purpose can't exist in that environment, so, like bacteria after the invention of penicillin, it has to adapt and change and find a new way to continue.  If only ""good"" ads make the jump, then I think we're better off as a whole.  If bad ads make the jump, we'll soon get pretty good at filtering them out as well.

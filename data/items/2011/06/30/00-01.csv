This means that you'd have to start off by knowing those rules and categorizing everything accordingly. After that, you have tons of edge cases to work out, e.g., what happens if I group two different categories of items into a special package? What percentage of the package is taxed at what rate? Or, what if different states categorize the same item in different ways? Or, what happens when you provide a service to sellers and then need the sellers to accurately provide all of this categorization for every jurisdiction?<p>Of all companies, Amazon probably has the best chance of getting this all figured out if they really had to.

In factwhy do they care if users share content at all? Are they really that loving of the human race that they are doing so solely for our benefit? Of course not.<p>A little background:<p>- Facebook and Google know an inordinate amount of data about you - they track, store, and interpret every move you make through their services with the goal of figuring out who you are, mainly to sell to you.<p>- But this wasn't enough, so Facebook introduced the Like button and Google +1. Now Facebook and Google can track your every move on the web - regardless of whether you interact with the button. Companies claim they delete this data, but only after they fully interpret it or extrapolate it into descriptive data.<p>- The problem that Facebook and Google still face however - is that they collect massive amounts of databut have a heck of a time monetizing itbecause they essentially spied to get it in the first place. So what is the solution? Well, if the user actively shares the contentespecially in a public realm but also privately, that user has consciously connected themselves to that content and monetization becomes easy.

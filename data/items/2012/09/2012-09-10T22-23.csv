Why work so hard to sabotage the user who checks md5sums when you can just wait for a user that doesn't? Just because thieves can carry lockpicks doesn't mean that you shouldn't bother locking your car: Protection against lazy, opportunistic thieves is still better than nothing.<p>The other advantage of the MD5 plan is that you can download the MD5 from a different site than the script, at a different time and over a different internet connection (or, perhaps, over https). A specific, important version of that use case is: If you're installing the script over and over again in an automated fashion, you can download its MD5 in advance, cache it, and then check it against every future download of the script to verify that the script hasn't changed. When the script gets updated and the MD5 legitimately changes, you audit the diff and then update your copy of the MD5 for the future.<p>Meanwhile, using curl-over-HTTPS seems like it couldn't hurt, but better make sure 'curl' is really checking the cert and aborting on cert mismatch, because tools can be very sloppy about this. Also, you're still trusting the third party site, and once their site gets hacked it's game over unless you have another canonical source for the MD5 sum.<p>One ultimately realizes why real packaging systems have signed packages, with private keys assigned to developers.",1347317522

And glass + lined notepaper is a weird combo in general. :)<p>But I agree with your take that in a case like that it's merely a stylistic choice (some of the other examples, though...). The interesting thing to me is the cyclical aspect: skins seemed to have died down in popularity, at least among the geek crowd, for the past decade. Apple's brushed metal stuff was largely derided, Luna got toned down to Aero Glass, Aqua got toned down to what it is today, ""skinnable"" became less and less a bullet point for apps (ah, for the good ol' days of Sonique and Audion...). It remained on the web, since there's no good ""native"" equivalent like for desktop apps, though even there Bootstrap was a move away. Then it exploded again, driven by iOS and an increase in single-page web apps. I have to wonder if it's due to an influx of new designers and developers who are starting on iOS or the web and missed the first go-round.

Are there really that many people having boring sex to make the amount of people coming close to and/or surpassing porn a statistical anomaly?</i><p>This is a bit like asking if Hollywood hacking is really that much different from real hacking. Real sex is exciting to the participants -- if done right, more exciting than porn sex -- but that excitement doesn't show up well when the act is filmed, so porn producers have settled on a series of tropes intended to make it exciting to the (predominantly male) audience. So there is lots of emphasis on body parts moving against and within each other, and the event of male ejaculation. To allow the camera a good view, porn actors fuck in positions that would be fatiguing if used regularly by people of ordinary fitness levels.<p>For most people, real sex involves a lot of kissing and fondling non-genital, non-breast body parts. (Sometimes biting, smacking, or pinching if you are kinky.) They may be seated or reclining, next to each other or one atop the other, for long periods of time with relatively little movement. Bringing a woman to orgasm is especially tricky: some can cum in 15 seconds while others require long and careful attention. Some have physical needs which <i>change</i> with time; I recall one girl who preferred a bit of roughness early in play and a gentler touch later on. When she does cum, a woman may scream and holler, moan quietly, or not at all; sometimes the only clue she gives you is holding you tighter, or an involuntary twitch of the hips that can be felt more than seen. Joe Six Pack stroking it at home doesn't want to see that shit, he just want bang bang bang. And that's what porn delivers, but imho it's the easiest and most boring part of a sexual relationship (whether committed or not).",1347314768

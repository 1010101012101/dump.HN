This new gene-editing protein called Cpf1—and maybe even others yet to be discovered—means that one patent may not be so powerful after all.<p>Just goes to show the silliness of patents. Even the lightbulb was invented by multiple people at the same time. Yet only one got to have a 20 year monopoly over it. Why should that be the case when multiple people invent it at the same time?

10284722,comment,10283028,10283497,0,0,jonsen,,,"50 m might definitly lead to problems in other settings.<p>&quot;Because both ends of the RS-232 circuit depend on the ground pin being zero volts, problems will occur when connecting machinery and computers where the voltage between the ground pin on one end, and the ground pin on the other is not zero. This may also cause a hazardous ground loop. Use of a common ground limits RS-232 to applications with relatively short cables. If the two devices are far enough apart or on separate power systems, the local ground connections at either end of the cable will have differing voltages; this difference will reduce the noise margin of the signals. Balanced, differential, serial connections such as USB, RS-422 and RS-485 can tolerate larger ground voltage differences because of the differential signaling.&quot;, cited from:<p><a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232</a>",1443308073

Quite a few people I know would be more comfortable sharing a mail address than their Facebook info, even if we ignore the percentage that doesn&#x27;t even have Facebook.<p>This is part of what&#x27;s backwards about Facebook.  Sometimes I&#x27;ve had a 5-15min conversation with someone at a bar and they&#x27;re like, &quot;Do you have Facebook?&quot;, and I&#x27;m like, &quot;Give me your phone&quot;, and I will search for myself and send myself a friend request.<p>If I exchanged phone numbers or e-mail addresses with this person, it would be really odd IMO to ask the sort of questions to which answers are offered to me by facebook, and by its&#x27; algorithm, but _less_ odd to personally contact them IMO.  So I&#x27;m kind of a wierd voyeur in basically a handful of strangers&#x27; lives and fairly rarely actually ever again meet up and do things with various people that seem to be a lot of fun to talk to when I meet them.<p>I&#x27;ve had a lot of interesting friendship circumstances arise, but also just spend a lot of time wondering who the fuck most of the people are, even on the new facebook.  Even the people I decided to carry over, I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s a semi-random distribution based on how Facebook was already filtering my feed, I think.  People I like, but I dunno.<p>It feels like Facebook has more influence over who I think about than I do at times, and I wonder if it isn&#x27;t influenced by what relationships tell them things they can advertise based on or something.",1443307762

Firefighters have 72-hour shifts but that includes bunking at the department.<p>If you go to publicpay.ca.gov, you&#x27;ll find the state wide databases of city and state employees. Police officers make up nearly all of the top non-executive positions. Second, police officers <i>want</i> overtime. If you&#x27;ve watched The Wire, there are more than a few scenes/threads in which eliminating overtime is seen as punishment to officers. This is also chronicled in David Simon&#x27;s non-fiction book, &quot;Homicide&quot;, which The Wire is heavily based off of.<p>This is not to say that we <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> staff departments in a way that overtime isn&#x27;t excessive. But I doubt you&#x27;ll find much political support from the officers or their leaders on that.<p>In fact, the use of overtimes is one of the best way for police officers to ensure a huge pension...Pensions are often calculated on based on the last year of a retiring officer&#x27;s salary.

Large companies also pivot (Apple, HP, Intel, Motorola...), so some will ride more than one wave.<p>Anyway, where there is demand, there should be supply, and conversely. The car manufacturing market boomed a couple of times. Ditto for bicycles. Home appliances as well. The PC market peaked in the 2000&#x27;s, now there is no point in keeping supplying these clunky metal boxes. Today the mobile apps market is very saturated, only 7 years after the App Store launched. Once customers buy a product, they won&#x27;t be on the market for some time, until the product gets amortized or dies, a big innovation occurs, or what have you. When 80% of customers already bought the product, the market is mature and concentration occurs, that&#x27;s always been the case. Maybe innovation getting faster is what is happening, so companies will be more shortlived. But the pace is bound by the customer&#x27;s income, so the bright side is there is a feedback loop.<p>I think an honest founder should at least try to find employees that understand the risks and pay them accordingly.

With digital cameras, even forcing the photographer to do a memory card format was not sure-proof, if the photographer knew how to run disk-recovery software. I remember at least one story where a police officer either confiscated a photojournalist&#x27;s memory card or made the photographer erase it...but the photojournalist had a dual-card camera in which all the photos were auto-copied to.<p>With all those subtleties and complexities about digital camera technology (SLR or smartphone cameras), it probably does make sense to a malicious cop to just take and &quot;lose&quot; the camera.

All the interesting things we can do with 1 as a literal (like adding it to 1.5) are also things we could do with the length of a one-element list, but in Haskell these two 1&#x27;s are not interchangeable. Also, defaulting rules seem to be a wart that&#x27;s necessary only because of overloaded literals. Maybe the literal 1 could have type Integer, and 1 + 1.5 could work through some other kind of typeclass magic?",1443305055

Native speakers of English are in demand from native speakers of almost all languages. If you are a native speaker of a language popular with English speakers (such as Spanish or French) and want to learn English you are also in luck. However, on sharedtalk there are often many speakers of certain languages (such as Turkish and Chinese) wanted to learn English whilst the reverse is not true, and if, for example, you are a Turkish speaker wanted to learn Czech then your chances of finding a suitable exchange partner are very slim indeed.<p>The speakers on sharedtalk also vary with the time of day, so it helps if your timezone is similar to that of the countries which speak the language you wish to learn.",1310515516

2757182,comment,2755599,2756736,4,0,joeyo,,,"I think there is a large class of people who have no moral objections to piracy. The only reason why they pay for something like netflix or itunes is because of convenience. That is, they are paying for the convenience, not the content. Therefore if the price goes up, and exceeds whatever value they are pricing that convenience, they naturally revert to other methods of getting the content (i.e. piracy).<p>So stealing is not ok because they didn't follow lean business principles--stealing was okay in the first place. It was just a happy coincidence that using netflix wasn't stealing.",1310515481

The amount of savings at there scale (200 million new files / day [1]) would be huge as data via S3 is already more expensive then running your own bare metal boxes. I would imagine that Dropbox pays some sort of bulk price, but I can't find any information.<p>I don't think the 5 billion dollar valuation is out of the ball park considering that they solve a problem that a lot of people encounter including my mother. Their solution is simple and elegant and seems to work. Last statistics I heard they had 25 million users [1] and growing, while I dont know how many of those users are active subscribers I can imagine the conversion ratio is much higher then normal freemium products.<p>While there has been a lot of anti-Dropbox news in the tech press lately, we need to remember we live in an information bubble that doesn't reach the normal user.<p>[1] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/17/billion-dollar-valuatio-club/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/17/billion-dollar-valuatio-clu...</a>",1310515385

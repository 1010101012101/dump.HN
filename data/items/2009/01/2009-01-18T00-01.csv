Usually the company issues a purchase order and I invoice against the purchase order, usually net 30 days, 15 if I can get away with it.  They send me the checks. I dont give discounts.  I havent worked with mom and pops.  My clients are multi-million to multi-billion corporations and I havent had any collections problems.  It's may be more problematical with sole proprietorships and such.  My billings are typically 5 digits per month.  If you are talking a few hundred per year, the purchasers usually expense it on a credit card because the PO process is so cumbersome.<p>Getting large companies to pay on time hasn't been an issue, but you need to agree to their idea of a schedule.

Install a templating language? or ensure your short-tags=On (or whatever that is) in your php.ini. And if you are talking about hosted service, short tags are by default kept ""On"" on most hosted services, if not all.<p><i><?php while(list($key, $item) = loop($iterator)){?></i><p>No, I can write any of the following if I want the variables localy.<p><?while($r=loop($rs)){?> <---- this is the version I use most frequently.<p><?foreach($rs as $key=>$item){?><p>or even<p><?while(extract(loop($rs))){?><p>Now compare all these with any other language beside PHP.

}<p>Imagine typing your full page like this! You need to enclose each of your line inside a quote and also escape all quotation marks inside it. Here code and design are mixed in real sense. These are the languages that really need a templating engine.<p><i>And the template engine can inline the code (rather than call a loop() function) for better performance.</i><p>Here is an idea, better performace is gained by not loading the templating engine at all. Whatever number of chars typing saved is more complicated by loading and initializing the whole templating engine. Even that is not enough, which is why Smarty has {if}, {else}, {switch} statements. So long for seperating code and design.<p><i>You might want to type twice as much identical code for each output variable</i><p>I am not typing identical code even once.<p><i>If only you had a template language that keeps you having to know that!</i><p>We can continue discussion without making attacks?

They're often unclear about intent, who has right of way, etc., when they see you at all, and that's where paths cross.<p>Being visible from behind is also important, but doesn't take anything extravagant: A five-red-LED blinker on your bike and a blinker on your helmet or large reflective strips on your bag is almost certainly sufficient. As long as you're not weaving from lane to lane and not terribly unlucky (e.g. being followed by a drunk or a car full of reckless teenagers), it's unlikely you'll get hit from behind.<p>(Fog/glow under the bike would be awesome, though.)",1232239990

The site still has local accounts, but users can now connect their local accounts to their facebook account Facebook or just login through Facebook (which actually creates a local account).<p>Beware: integrating with FC turned out to be a surprisingly large undertaking, although lots of that effort was spent a) trying to assemble an understanding from the FC docs about how the thing actually works and b) figuring out how to handle all of the weird cases (and the common cases, for that matter).<p>The FC developer docs are not all that coherent. The wiki seems to cover most of what you'd need to know, but lots of the information is on pages only linked to from obscure other pages, and there's not a good big-picture technical explanation. Even worse, much of the wiki is locked down so you can't fix it.<p>And there are a bunch of special cases to handle.. what if a user is logged into a facebook-linked local account on your site but is logged in as the wrong facebook user? Or what if they're logged into a facebook-connected local account and not logged into facebook?

Netbooks are getting faster (and this <i>is</i> needed for some webapps e.g. that musical score webapp is a little sluggish on my eee PC).

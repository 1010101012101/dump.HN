705587,comment,704557,705260,0,0,wglb,,,"I'm a little more familiar with SNOBOL, but ICON is imperative and procedural and a bit complicated, and it looks tempting as a target for this little thought experiment that we have, writing a compiler to understand how it works.<p>Now it would not be a fair test to go after scheme or lisp, as there are many examples out there of people who have implemented toy schemes and toy lisps.  Toy here in the sense of tutorial or exploratory.<p>So being a simple country boy, I seem to be having trouble coming up with examples in line with your point. I wonder if you could give me some examples of non-procedural languages for which this exercise would not work--the exercise of writing a compiler for a language not being successful for learning the language without doing extensive rigorous mathematical semantic modeling?",1247662598

705583,comment,705174,705174,0,0,elecengin,,,"I sometimes think that patent trolls are just the scapegoat for larger issues at hand. Patent trolls are simply acting upon their rights with issued patents. In many cases, the patent trolling is not what is absurd - it is the patents. Patents that really never should have issued.<p>We have a IP culture in the United States where patents are distributed very freely and with minimal review. This generally isnt a problem because litigation is the ""nuclear button"" of IP enforcement - it costs 1million+ for both sides even to start. So, as long as everyone just uses patents are trading cards everything is fine. Companies routinely start new enterprises without a prior art search... because they do not expect anyone to actually _litigate_.<p>When the absurd patents go to litigation, though, it becomes painfully clear how broad and abusive the patents in question were in the first place. Big companies are embarrassed and emptied of their money because they _did_ infringe.<p>The USPTO must become more selective when issuing patents, and companies must own up to the fact that they are responsible for infringement, no matter who owns the patent or if they are an NPE or not.",1247662319

Lose it and it's gone forever.<p>Regardless of <i>your</i> definition of ""ethical"", if <i>I</i> think it's unethical, then you've lost my trust and our relationship is over.

705579,comment,705258,705517,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"When making moral judgments you have to treat society as a single entity.  Either that or choose to simply not make the judgments at all.  Because there are just too many people in society to calculate the exact amount of good or bad a decision will be to them.<p>Accordingly, you can only really use ""it's good for society"" if there's a clear benefit.  Exposing a chemical company that dumps waste into a town's water supply is a clear benefit.  As is making false financial statements in order to inflate your stock to the point where millions will eventually lose their savings.  These are clear cases where a whistle blowers in justified.<p>But yes, as far as what's a clear case there is some judgment involved.

While I <i>really</i> like using Emacs's buffer-based environment as the common interface (such as working in a shell buffer and being able to edit results), I'm not convinced that adding more and more functionality to the same process is a good idea from an architectural standpoint.

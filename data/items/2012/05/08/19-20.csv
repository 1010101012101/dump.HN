There could be two routes that involve almost same distance in miles, but  the slightly longer one is likely to take less time. Which constitutes most direct? It turns into an optimization problem, possibly with no obviously optimal point (particularly when you account for fuzziness needed to deal with unexpected traffic patterns, accidents, etc).<p>* Finally, the ad-laden route could be a free ride, whereas the ""direct"" route could be paid.

3945510,comment,3944339,3945029,1,0,dalke,,,"Wow. I do not recognize your description of factories, economics, or political systems. iPads are made in China, governed by the Communist Party of China. They have migrated from a planned economy to one of ""socialism with Chinese characteristics."" Is this a communist factory?<p>I think you are confusing a ""planned economy"" with ""communism."" But even then, there is nothing in the definition of a planned economy to say that all people in a certain position have the same daily wage. The Soviet union had an incentive system. For example, <a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09668134908409742"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09668134908409742</a> says ""encourages the foremost collective farmers by means of adding extra labour-days.""<p>You idealize the idea of the piece-rate system, without realizing that that's the system used in the Soviet Union during the Stalinist era. Read in \n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_reform_in_the_Soviet_Union,_19561962"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_reform_in_the_Soviet_Union...</a> how the Khrushchev era reform movement pushed to move from a quota system to ""standardising their wages and reducing their dependence on overtime or bonus payments.""<p>From that page, ""The piece-rate system led to an enormous level of bureaucracy and contributed to huge inefficiencies in Soviet industry. In addition, factory managers frequently manipulated the personal production quotas given to workers to prevent workers' wages from falling too low.""<p>So it seem that your ""capitalist factory"" is using the same piece-system incentive system as used during the Soviet era, which is about as communist as you can get.<p>I also think you are confusing ""capitalist"" with ""meritocracy."" The US during the period of slavery was under laissez-faire capitalism, but quite obviously slaves did not enjoy the same benefits which you attribute to capitalism, and a slave working the same job, with the same abilities as a free man was unlikely to make the same rates.<p>You write ""Obviously, the people who are happy with $100 per day are now pissed off, either because they don't want or simply can't work that hard."" Or they might put their family life ahead of the company's bottom line and think that 40 hours of week is enough even if some people want to work 80 hour weeks.<p>Finally, you wrote ""The only ones benefiting from communism are those who make the laws and control the factories/country."" There's nothing unique to communism there. The same holds with capitalism. If only the richest 1% in a capitalist country make the laws and control the factories/country, then it's very likely that they are benefiting the most. The economic system and the form of government are not as strongly coupled as you suggest.",1336506826

I would suspect as well that the float money would be limited in terms of what the bank can use it for in terms of short term investments as it might well fall into regulations regarding the bank's capital reserve requirements as the money doesn't technically belong to the bank at that point.<p>I'll say though that retail banking is not my area - I work with derivatives and risk.<p>For what it's worth, I've got no beef at all with someone trying to do ACH better.

This isn't a problem for C and C++ because their runtimes are very minimal. DO-178b Level A-certified implementations of the standard libraries exist for various real-time operating systems. As long as you use them, you're golden.<p>However, any system that runs on top of a virtual machine is problematic because of how extensive their runtimes are. Developing an efficient and competitive DO-178b-certified JVM, for example, would be a huge undertaking, but so would modifying an existing JVM.<p>Further, anything garbage collected is a problem because you can't have any situations where a timing constraint is violated because of your garbage collector. The best way to prevent this would be to schedule, say, 50 milliseconds every second for garbage collection. But there's still a limit there where the GC can no longer keep up with the rate of garbage production, which could lead to your application running out of memory and failing. Proving that your application will never reach said limit would be hard either by static or dynamic analysis.",1336506011

Progress as a whole is moving way too fast to justify ANY\ntemporal monopolies over inventions. The curve of technological advancement is\nprobably roughly exponential. The more we discover, the faster we can discover\nmore things. We're sacrificing the <i>advancement of the entirety of mankind</i> for\nthe profit of a few corporations.<p>><i>The only mechanism that is available to gov't to compensate an inventor is to grant a temporary monopoly.</i><p>Utterly wrong. A lot of research (including the worst example, the pharma industry)\nis funded directly or indirectly by the government, full or in part. Quite a lot\nof research is done by universities in cooperation with the industry. It's nonsense\nto imply that patents are the only viable solutions. They aren't, and they are probably\nthe worst solution anybody could come up with. They are a crutch and an impediment to\nmankind as a whole.<p>On your miracle drug: highly contrived example. Most pharma research <i>is</i>, at least in good part,\nfunded by the public through the government. In addition, a very large part of the cost of a drug\nis <i>marketing</i>. Yes, that's right - the pharma industry spends billions on ads.<p>In addition, this model is fundamentally flawed. It's a lot more profitable to develop treatments\n(for symptoms etc) than it is to develop cures. I'd wager that without this nonsensical system,\nwe could already have a solution to AIDS and severely reduced the lethality of cancer.<p>Also, I do not care how many billions went into the development of a drug. A human life is\ninfinitely worth more than that. I get sick when I see corporations whining about their\n""intellectual property getting stolen"" when developing countries decide to produce generic\nclones to <i>save human lives</i>, like recently the case in India.<p>Again, I simply reject the notion that there needs to (and in fact, that there <i>can</i>)\nbe any sort of artificial monopolies\nor other forms of ownership over inventions and technologies. By getting rid of this\nparadoxical and, frankly, unethical system, we would gain a monumental speed-up in\ntechnological progress. I postulate we could be colonizing the solar system by now if we'd\nnever allowed this system to emerge.<p>As a final note, it's funny how you accuse me of thinking in the short term - that couldn't\nbe any more wrong. If anything, I fight for the prolonged future of humanity, decades and\ncenturies from now. The patent system is <i>utterly unsustainable</i> in light of this.<p>People will eventually look back at this system and ask themselves how we could ever allow\nownership over abstract concepts. They will shake their heads at the notion of intellectual\nproperty while freely accessing, using and improving upon the shared heritage of all mankind.

3945340,comment,3945031,3945031,4,0,slapshot,,,"To be clear, this is a discussion of ""net neutrality"" in that the author alleges that Comcast is prioritizing (and not charging for) traffic for its Xbox streaming media application, which works like a Video-on-Demand service.  Comcast claims that this is similar to a standard Video-on-Demand service based in a cable box and can legally be prioritized because it is the functional equivalent of traditional VOD.  Comcast doesn't see anything wrong with not charging for bandwidth used for set-top-box VOD, and analogizes that to Xbox VOD, even though the two may use different underlying technologies.<p>The author says that it shouldn't be treated like VOD because it is delivered over an IP network rather than old-school cable and Comcast has no right to prioritize video packets for its own IP video service over those for other IP video services (e.g., Netflix).<p>Which is more ""neutral"" is an interesting question: neutrality over the mechanism by which Comcast delivers its VOD service to cable subscribers, or neutrality between IP-based video streaming services?",1336504239

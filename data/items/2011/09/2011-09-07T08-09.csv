     we think is going to be the web of one. For instance, on our today module in the 
     front page, every 5 minutes we have 32,000 different variations of that module. 
     So you dont even know what Im seeing in fact we serve a million different front 
     page modules a day and thats just through content optimization. And thats just 
     the beginning. Customized because we know the things youre interested in. Maybe 
     you dont like light entertainment maybe you like a certain sports team, etc. And 
     our click through rate went up twice. So the point is, people come to us to find 
     out what is going on with the world in a very nice quick fashion to do their 
     communications, email, messanger, check-in on their teens. We all know about 
     Yahoo finance. Its a places where you can just get it together. Its collated 
     for you, its all the things as youre moving, you can even get your social

The installation media and recovery CDs don't either.<p>That is enough justification, especially when you're at a single user mode console on a ILO card when the machine won't boot and flames are coming out of everything.  Vi is there for you and emacs SSH won't be saving you when the network is not up so you cant apt-get or yum emacs.  It's also not the sort of time you want to start having to learn vi.<p>I know this because I've been there.<p>It's as important as it always was, much as pen and paper are.",1315383451

One example: It makes sense that iOS only allows you to drag one app at a time. Making it possible to select more than one app would only complicate things and confuse. It absolutely doesnt make sense to have the same limitation in Launchpad.",1315383254

  - Focus on products which can generate revenue ""out the gate""[0].

This gets operating expenditures down, which buys time. That's pretty much all it does, though.<p>Then I'd sit back and ask the company[1] ""what do we do?"" Depending upon the answer, those are the products, strategies, and revenue opportunities we pursue next.<p>My personal feelings here probably wouldn't matter much, because no matter how intelligent I, or anybody else is, the top 100 creative producers at a company like Yahoo would probably be more creative, intelligent, in-touch, etc than I just by stint of sheer numbers[2]. So, take the best of their ideas[3], and execute on them.<p>Then, after building up a business which can sustain itself again, I'd start pursuing longer term goals. These goals would be aligned with what the company is capable of: large-scale, software-driven, media operations on the web.<p>During all of this, of course, there'd need to be a lot of firing and hiring. It'd suck. I'd hate it. But, knowing the tech industry, the people who were fired would find better jobs, and the new people would want to prove themselves. The trick is making sure you didn't waste effort on Sisyphean tasks. Yahoo is not a research company. Yahoo takes existing innovations and brings them to a mass market. Focusing on that would be a strength.<p>[0] A rodeo term, believe it or not.<p>[1] Or, say, the top 100 creative people there.<p>[2] Finally noticed me stealing plays from the Apple playbook?<p>[3] By which I mean, ""ideas which can make lots of cash in the short term"".",1315383111

They try to condense it into 4 steps, but... well, let's break this down.<p><i>- Need 10k enrollees.</i> The definition of ""enrollee"" seems loose here, so given some mindless campaigning this is actually the easy part. Let's give it a <i>modest</i> 3 months.<p><i>- Ah, nice,</i> so now that we've supposedly got enough people, we need to spin up a little marketing campaign to get people to sign off on it. Alas, this isn't a feel good movie, so we're going to give this a nice... six months (being pretty generous here).<p><i>- Oh, shit, uhh...</i> hey guys, you all also need to be pre-approved for loans. We didn't really do anything to check this out when we got you all mentally invested (if you're even still interested by this point). We're lucky if we get half of you! Allocate at least a year for this, since there <i>won't</i> be the 10k people that originally got onboard, and numbers need to be shored up again.<p><i>- Step three begins</i> when we get a board to actually approve all of this. There's really no guarantee this part will work; that said, if it does, we're saying 1.5 years for all of the basic setup.<p><i>- Step four, huzzah!</i> We're building homes... for another 1.5 years. Can't live here just yet! No worries, though, we've got a super high speed build process... hey, wait, you're not listening, are you?<p>There are so many pitfalls with this it's not even funny (and I'm being incredibly generous with the numbers above). I'm guessing the people behind this are from the Bay area; surprised they never heard of a drop off rate. ;P<p>Speaking of the people behind this, who are they? There's absolutely no information on this site explaining why you should ever bother placing some level of trust in the efforts spearheaded by these people.<p>Then again, maybe this entire thing is a joke. I almost felt certain of it when I read this line:<p><i>This step is all about social networking.  We need 10,000 enrollees to complete this step.  Tell your friends, neighbors, cousins, distant acquaintances, cats, dogs, and anyone who will listen.  If everyone does this, we will finish this step in about twenty five minutes.</i>",1315382450

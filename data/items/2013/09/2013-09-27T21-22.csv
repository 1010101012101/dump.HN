It doesn&#x27;t go into your log.  It doesn&#x27;t affect your state.  It never happened.  Packet caused an infinite loop?  You never got that packet.  And so on.<p>If an event depends on data that&#x27;s been deleted, that event  never happened.  But, at the Unix level (which can generate any events it wants), we can generate <i>another</i> event which reports the error.  So it&#x27;s not like things fall silently down the hole, either.  (For the same reason, you can also get the stack trace of the infinite loop that was interrupted by your ^C.)",1380319162

It roughly suggests a political tipping point somewhere around a population density of about 800-1,000 people per square mile.</i><p>My guess would be that this is a linear fit using a least squares minimization. The fit is dominated by the upper right portion of the plot and has a relatively arbitrary x-intercept of around -10. Population density going negative doesn&#x27;t make sense and shouldn&#x27;t be a feature of a reasonable model. There&#x27;s no tipping point, it&#x27;s just how the line shows up on a log plot and it&#x27;s almost entirely determined by the data with population density much great than 1000.<p>I think it would make a more sense to plot population density on the x-axis because the scatter in the data is really coming from the Cook PVI rather than the population density and the Cook PVI can be interpreted as a dependent variable. We know very precisely what the populations are and we can also see that the magnitude of the Cook PVI scatter looks roughly constant as a function of population density. After this a simple least squares fit would be more reasonable to apply but again a line would not fit the data at all. Just by eye I would say that (Cook PVI)=A<i>x</i>Log[ (Population Density)<i>x</i>B ] would do a much better job modeling the distribution.<p>Overall, it&#x27;s a nice plot to motivate discussion but the fit doesn&#x27;t really add anything to it and might even detract from it.",1380315914
6459568,comment,6458794,6459471,3,0,mbrubeck,,,"> <i>URIs are names for data.</i><p>Yes, they are, essentially.  But the difference is that an HTTP URI is not a name for <i>a</i> piece of data -- instead it is a set of instructions that say &quot;connect to this network endpoint and send them this string; in return you will get <i>some</i> data.&quot;  The data may be different every time someone follows these steps to dereference the URI.  A single URI does not name a single piece of data.<p>In a URI scheme where the URIs really name the data (rather than an address for finding data), you can get away from TCP-style point-to-point networking in cases where it makes sense, like in one-to-many broadcasts.  The paper I linked [1] specifically compares PARC&#x27;s content-centric network protocol against TCP+HTTP in these scenarios.  And it&#x27;s not just one-to-many that can benefit; see also the VoCCN paper [2] for a very different use case.<p>I agree that you could (and should) still use URIs for data in your content-centric network, which is why I think we could evolve the web platform to use CCN without any major upheaval.  You just need to add a new URI scheme besides http and https.  For the web, the changes would not be at the application layer but at lower layers like TCP and routing.  But more importantly, CCN would help enable new types of platforms (like Urbit?) that do <i>not</i> look like the web.<p>[1] <a href=""http://conferences.sigcomm.org/co-next/2009/papers/Jacobson.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://conferences.sigcomm.org/co-next/2009/papers/Jacobson....</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.parc.com/publication/2319/voccn.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.parc.com/publication/2319/voccn.html</a>",1380315897

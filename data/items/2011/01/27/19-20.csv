2149142,comment,2147843,2148972,0,0,tallpapab,,,"After 83 weeks I did find work. The reason it was difficult was my age plus few openings. The age thing is interesting. Some places where I applied I got past phone screens that gave fairly little programming quizzes. When I got to the in person interviews there were no questions about me experience, education, or publications. It seemed the whole process was geared to finding folks fresh out of college. Things are picking up here. The recruiters are calling and there seem to be more openings. The unemployment insurance was helpful. Keep in mind though that I have paid more into it over the years than I have gotten out of it. That's fine and fits with the general pattern of insurance. That's why insurance companies make money. I guess I have two point. One is that it is insurance, as opposed to a direct handout from the government. The other is that age discrimination is a big factor that Phil's agenda does not address. OK, there's a third point in that market conditions also make Phil's agenda impractical although I agree that folks should try to ""retool"" during hard times. It's just not ass easy and effective as Phil suggests.<p>About the high expectations, perhaps I do. I don't think that's so bad though. I hope you do too. A difficulty though is that so do prospective employers. They are often reluctant to offer lower pay to people that they feel might flee when times improve and they can find a better job.",1296156973

In my experience, many if not most who come from the non-philosophy discipline arrive with little to no respect for the philosophy half of the course. They enter with the popular conception of philosophy as something vague and contemplative.<p>What this leads to is that the non-philosophy participants get frustrated that the discussion seems to center on silly or archaic questions of metaphysics, as you have described regarding dualism. In truth, though, most of the archaic questions persist with more sophisticated questions and pushed farther down the rabbit hole.<p>Take dualism, for example. While dualism in the sense of the ancient and medieval philosophers has no supporters remaining, the ontological status of consciousness and intelligence is still a much-contested topic.<p>I want to emphasize, here, that I'm not talking about the causal status of various states of consciousness or that consciousness seems wholly dependent on physical processes and structures. These are trivial points and givens in a modern discussion of the topic.<p>The interesting question is not the basis or the mechanism of sentience but rather the phenomenon of the sentience itself. Even if a thought is entirely constituted by physical phenomena, it corresponds with a separate set of subjective phenomena which are not obviously physical -- our internal life and our awareness.<p>With no disrespect intended and with no pretense that my understanding of these problems is anything approaching complete, I've found that many who share your experience to not fully have grasped the essence of the given problem in question, often satisfied with an intuitive answer that, were they to more seriously delve into the matter, they might understand to have been powerfully undermined 2500 years earlier.<p>There's a reason that when most of the sciences spun out from under the label of philosophy, some matters of consequence and importance defied progressing toward that more solid ground.<p>I expect many would say that this is because the remaining questions are nonsensical. Despite my personal experience to the contrary, I understand this viewpoint. It is at least worth consideration, though, that the philosophical questions that remain won't submit to the scientific method; that's why they are philosophy. Many of the greatest minds in history struggled with these questions, for centuries, not because they were lacking in relevant facts but because they realized this special class of problem that seemed impossibly beyond any collection of future facts.<p>In studying philosophy, it's difficult but essential to guard against letting the absurdities of a given era's ignorance occlude the essential aspects of their arguments on questions that are still open. Usually those arguments prove to be quite relevant to the modern understanding with only minor tweaks to particulars.<p><i></i>*As an aside, please excuse me for placing all of this under your comment as I'm not trying to lecture you as much as present ideas in response to similar themes your anecdote evokes.

And it is also much different from Neuroscience.<p>Neuroscience asks 'How does the Brain work?' \n(Based in biology and chemistry).<p>Artificial intelligence asks 'How do I simulate human intelligence?' \n(Based in math, and computer science, complexity theory).<p>Philosophy of the mind asks a lot of messy questions that don't really fall into either of those buckets. The mind isn't the brain, and the mind isn't strictly human intelligence, so what is it?. What is consciousness? How is it that I have an idea of self? What are my perceptions? How do I model the world around me? What's up with free will?<p>It is as much about asking these questions and refining them into new questions, as it is about anything else, and most of these questions really can't be answered with scientific facts or mathematical algorithms.<p>From the aspect of learning philosophy in a historical context, you kind of have to, otherwise you are sort of doomed to repeat the mistakes of others who came before. In stark contrast to science, in philosophy, you are questioning the nature of reality. Hence you cannot really design experiments (unless you are G.E. Moore), to prove this or that philosophical property. Instead, you have to build on all of the other work that has come before you, and understand why the things that people thought were true, are untenable or not true.<p>(rather long unrelated tangent: A number of people, like pg, think this is kind of stupid. The other options, unfortunately, are chasing our tails, or simply saying that these questions are unanswerable. Sometimes, Wittgenstein is interpreted as saying that all philosophical questions are simply reduced to 'language games'.My interpretation is more that he is making a statement about the relationship between reality and language, we are using language do describe reality, but there are certain things which contain the reality which cannot be described with language, because language is a part of that reality. There is a very strong parallel between his work and Godels'.)<p>So no, philosophers do not ignore science. But a lot of the time, when something has been solved by science, philosophers stop worrying about that realm so much. (Why use philosophy where you can use objective fact?)<p>Another example is that philosophy is very firmly ingrained in things like string theory or quantum mechanics. But the truth is, string theory and quantum mechanics boil down to equations which describe things that we have already observed. You still need a discipline in which you can speculate and say, 'Ok, but what does this mean about the nature of my reality? How does this effect me beyond being interesting math? What is the implication here?'<p>And that is what philosophy does.",1296156120

There is no core of knowledge one must master. The closest you come to that is a knowledge of what various individual philosophers have said about different topics over the years. Few were sufficiently correct that people have forgotten who discovered what they discovered.""<p>The subject matter of philosophy is the world of abstract ideas. Some call them universals, they are to be contrasted with cold hard facts, stuff we can reason scientifically about. It is not that ""few were sufficiently correct"" but rather (as Kant for one pointed out) that metaphysical claims like the famous ""Gods exists"" or the ""universe is infinite"" can be asserted to be true while at the same time there opposite can be asserted to be true! ""God does not exist"". ""The universe is finite"". Now, does that make everyone wrong? No, of course not, a wiser person just digs deeper.<p>And this: ""But did studying logic teach me the importance of thinking this way, or make me any better at it? I don't know.""<p>The thing is, as I've come to realize (from thinking about it long and hard!) is that logic is not a part of philosophy. Yes they go hand-in-hand but logic is really a cross-disciplinary tool with applications in many disciplines, mathematics, computer science, philosophy and so on. Just because it has traditionally been very closely associated with philosophy can mislead us into thinking that logic is part of philosophy. And so to blame philosophy because learning logic didn't benefit you in the way you thought it would is a category error at the very least in my opinion.<p>I'll stop here but I have to say, I would love if Paul were a bit more humble and a bit less arrogant and realize that there's a reason philosophy is so difficult. It's not because it's all smoke and mirrors and sophistry - though there is some of that, and you need the mental tools to sort the wheat from the chaff. You know Richard Rorty has said that philosophy is merely a branch of literature! And he was one of the leading philosophical figures of the last century! Think about that for a moment...",1296155810

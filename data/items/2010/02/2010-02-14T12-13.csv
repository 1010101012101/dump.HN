1124539,comment,1123314,1124360,0,0,antileet,,,"Thanks for your advice. I never saw it this way.<p>Maybe I didn't give enough details in my original post. This was a little hack that I thought would be cool, and would help me learn how to write comet-based apps (which it did). When Omegle came out, was a little annoyed but since our project was a few days of work, I put the code away and focused on my main project. I didn't even hear of omegle again after then until a few weeks after that.<p>But still, my current project is chasing a first mover with a few months' head start and it's nice to get reaffirmation that we don't need to be first movers to get ahead.<p>P.S. If you're interested, here are slides from a presentation we gave in our local startup interaction session:

I honestly thought that's what I was meant to do: the API should be optimized for power, and the local wrapper for usability in the local context.<p>But it's also a matter of style. I just wrote a function the other day to do the equivalent of:<p><pre><code>    Map m = makeMap( ""key1"",  ""value1"",

The better you know each other, the fewer of such cues are necessary, but especially among 'new' people, you'd better make sure they get you are being sarcastic/ironic, lest they get a completely wrong impression of you. The lack of cues and subsequent misunderstandings is exactly the problem with speech on the internet and is exactly why things like italics exist: to be able to shift emphasis like you'd do with speech or nonverbal cues.",1266150195

Traditionally, your neighbors have the ability to give you more rights (jury nullification), but they don't have the right to take rights away.  The Miller Test completely reversed that; now your neighbors can take your rights away for no reason at all.  (Would a black defendant be given the same rights as a white defendant?  That's why we elect representatives to make laws, rather than letting the neighborhood lynchmob decide what the laws are.)<p>Having to worry about what your neighbors will think discourages valuable work, acting as a prior restraint on speech.

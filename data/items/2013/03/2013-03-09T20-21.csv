This makes sense in C++ since casting a pointer to a class can trigger some address adjustement if the target class of this instance pointed to is multiple derived (and maybe in other cases?). There is no way such adjustment can happen if the source type is void*, because then you don't know what the source type really is.",1362862798

For example CrankShaft and TraceMonkey find areas where variables are simply-typed and heavily optimize those.<p>This isn't surprising - to make JS be fast, you do need to find where you can make it go faster, by avoiding the ""normal"" JS dynamism where anything is possible. So the JIT optimizes it as something that is ""not JS"". Again, nothing new with asm.js there, JS JITs have been doing this since 2008 (and JITs in other languages far earlier).<p>> You can use NEON directly from NaCL/ARM [..] NaCL can output ARM and x86 binaries directly<p>Those are not portable, which JS must be. A better comparison might be PNaCl, which is like NaCl but has an intermediary portable format. PNaCl will of course have the same issues asm.js does with not having direct binaries that can just be loaded and run, not allowing use of CPU-specific code, etc.<p>If you don't care for portability, then the web/JS/asm.js/WebGL/etc etc. are likely not the best thing for you. Instead, a native app could make more sense.",1362862718

If it was, who would pay for all the costs of network growth?<p>My complaint here is that comcast charges as much for peering as for transport (with full routes)  -  I mean, if that's the case, why advertise paid peering services?  Every time I've bought full routes I've had the option of asking the provider to only send me customer routes, or to filter on my end for customer routes.  Hell, most people will give me a feed with customer routes, and another with full routes, so I could use them as a de-prioritized transport provider of last resort as well as gaining all the benefits of being a peer if I bought transport from them, so yeah, advertising paid peering at transport prices is just silly.<p>My second complaint is that they aren't on any peering exchanges.  Peering exchanges are important because individual interconnects in a datacenter are expensive; the data center charges you a hefty monthly fee for every connection you have to other people at the same datacenter (like half what you'd pay for a shitty but local room in a shared house)  /and/ then if you use direct interconnects both parties need to maintain a switch port.<p>With a peering exchange?  you maintain one switchport for all your traffic that goes over the exchange.  There are even route servers you can subscribe to if you want to automatically peer with everyone else on the route server at that exchange, making peering a nearly zero work, zero cost thing.<p>(Of course, if you are sending a /lot/ of traffic, then a individual link probably makes more sense, sure, but I'm not sending a lot of traffic.)<p>>If HE.net had to pay as much as their peers for the network costs, the prices would be similar.<p>But they are similar.  after negotiation, he.net is more expensive than Cogent.  to the tune that commits on he cost the same as overages on Cogent.<p>HE.net, for me, is actually pretty competitive with Cogent, who I think is their closest competitor, quality-wise.    After negotiation, Cogent was slightly cheaper.  (The interesting thing about he.net was that they started with a number that was fairly reasonable and stuck with it.  It was clear that I didn't have to spend three months dicking around to get the real price, which I appreciate.)   Cogent started off asking about as much as I'd expect to pay for L3 after negotiating well, but came down hard.<p>>You get what you pay for....<p>If you believe that... well, I've got some Premium VPS here for you.   just $100/month per gigabyte ram.   They are ""premium""  - way better than the regular stuff.    I'll even wear a suit while I provision you.<p>People are always willing to charge you more for a shitty product.  Always.   Professionals spend huge amounts of effort getting you to pay more for the shitty product.  (More for the good product, too.)<p>Hell, in the bandwidth world? It's completely normal to end up paying 1/5th the asking price after negotiation.   Yeah, 20% of what the salesperson initially quoted is about what I normally end up paying for transit.<p>Do you think service is different for people who pay the asking price vs. people who negotiate down to the real price?<p>I mean, sure, buying transport from L3 is going to get you better connectivity than buying you transport from Cogent, and L3 is generally going to cost you more than Cogent.   How much more?  with my negotiation skills, about 10x more, but I only got L3 down half from their asking price, and I got Cogent down to 1/5th their asking price;  I spent considerably more time on Cogent because I thought that was, well, more realistic, and at the time, Linode, the people I see as my competitors to beat, were mostly he.net, which, quality-wise, is on par with Cogent (I think he.net may be a bit better, and there is some argument if cogent or he.net is slightly better, but I think most people would agree that they are both near the bottom of the pile.)<p>So yeah.  uh, I guess there is some relationship between ""real price"" and quality... but it is not nearly as close a relationship as people say.",1362862471

Historical research is centered around primary sources, and while no primary source gives you a complete picture or has a single interpretation, they are not mere anecdotes or outright lies.<p>Second, no serious historian thinks you should use specific events from the past to draw grand conclusions about the present.  The past loses potency when taken out of context.  But the study of history still has applications to the present.  When you have worked with incomplete evidence and conflicting interpretations of the past, you start to realize that your view of the present is similarly imperfect.  Any one person only has an incomplete picture of what is happening in the world, but despite this, I encounter many people who think events or trends have only <i>one</i> cause and they know <i>exactly</i> what it is.  As another example, people often expect the future to work out a particular way, and fail to appreciate the effects of other, unseen forces.  It is easier to realize these fallacies when you have studied history, where information is more obviously imperfect and you have the benefit of being detached.<p>You are right about the limits of reason, but you are wrong to say that history is harmful: to the contrary it is one of the best ways for us to realize those limits.",1362862120

We also have a history of mathematics and sciences, social and culture histories, histories of the planet, the stars, and all known life forms.

5349568,comment,5345538,5346571,2,0,reirob,,,"Many thanks for your effort to explain it to me. You made work my brain!<p>At first I was really stuck, when trying to understand your code. And I actually started to describe my difficulties. And then by writing them down I started to understand bit by bit. So just because most of the text is already written and maybe if somebody is struggling like me in understanding this code, I will write down my journey...<p>First, for the convenience of potential readers, here your original code:<p><pre><code>  import Data.Map
  import Control.Monad

  number   = return
  add      = liftM2 (+)
  multiply = liftM2 (*)
  variable = findWithDefault 0

  environment = fromList [(""a"",3), (""b"",4), (""c"",7)]

  expressionTree = add (variable ""a"") (multiply (number 2) (variable ""b""))

  main = print $ expressionTree environment
</code></pre>
First difficulty for me, as a Haskell beginner, are the functions without parameters and without types. So trying to grok the code I wrote them down with everything. I write the function 'number' as<p><pre><code>  number n = return n
</code></pre>
If I check in GHCI with ':type number' I get<p><pre><code>  number :: Integer -> Map [Char] Integer -> Integer
</code></pre>
How the heck can this function become this type signature? But OK, apparently there is this hidden parameter of type 'Map [Char] Integer' that is passed when it is called. So I should be able to write the function number with explicit signature (that Haskell otherwise infers) and the 2nd parameter:<p><pre><code>  number :: Integer -> Map [Char] Integer -> Integer
  number n env = return n
</code></pre>
... and guess what? GHCI does not accept it and throws some cryptic error. How does this make sense? Haskell tells me through its inferred type signature that the function number takes 2 arguments (Integer) and (Map [Char] Integer) and returns only one. But when I write the function with a 2nd  argument it does NOT accept it?<p>I was struggling here some time. Until I realized that in this example the 'return' function actually as well needs to get the 2nd argument. So if I rewrite it like this:<p><pre><code>  number :: Integer -> Map [Char] Integer -> Integer
  number n env = return n env
</code></pre>
it is accepted by the compiler. It might seem trivial now, but when I read your definition of 'return' being:<p><pre><code>  return x = \ _ -> x
</code></pre>
it does not show any 2nd parameter and additionally confusing in the function body takes from wherever some parameter that it ignores (_). I understand that it should mean that the function 'return' returns another function that takes whatever argument you give it and returns the value that you provided to the 'return' function. But for me as a beginner this:<p><pre><code>  return x _ = x
</code></pre>
is much clearer and has actually the same type signature. So far I would cynically conclude that Monads are about saving keyboard strokes by omitting writing parameters which are actually there. But I guess there is more than that.<p>But anyway, after I understood where the strange type signature with a 2nd parameter comes from, the rest was easier. Here my beginners' rewrite of the variable function:<p><pre><code>  variable :: [Char] -> Map [Char] Integer -> Integer
  variable vn env = findWithDefault 0 vn env
</code></pre>
This is pretty straight forward. Moving on:<p><pre><code>  *Main> :t expressionTree 
  expressionTree :: Map [Char] Integer -> Integer
</code></pre>
I could understand where 'Map [Char] Integer' comes from when I looked how 'expressionTree' is used, namely by giving it the environment 'expressionTree environment'. So I rewrite the definition of expressionTree as:<p><pre><code>  expressionTree e = add (variable ""a"") (multiply (number 2) (variable ""b"")) e
</code></pre>
Which now makes clear that the function 'add' takes 3 parameters and returns an Integer. And here came the next difficulty:<p><pre><code>  *Main> :type add
  add
    :: (Map [Char] Integer -> Integer)
       -> (Map [Char] Integer -> Integer) -> Map [Char] Integer -> Integer
</code></pre>
My first reaction was: What? Why does (variable ""a"") have a signature of a function, it should just return an Integer? This helped me to understand:<p><pre><code>  *Main> :type variable
  variable :: [Char] -> Map [Char] Integer -> Integer
  *Main> :type variable ""a""
  variable ""a"" :: Map [Char] Integer -> Integer
</code></pre>
With 'variable ""a""' a new function is constructed which has already got its 1st parameter and just needs the environment as 2nd environment, which again will be done by the 'liftM2' function inside 'add'. If I recall correctly the construction of such new function is called 'partial function application' in Haskell terminology. But anyway from there on the rest becomes clear. Maybe just for beginners (the '$' sign is confusing) and completeness of this explanation I would rewrite the last line as:<p><pre><code>  main = print (expressionTree environment)
</code></pre>
As I told you, you made my brain do a lot of work (and my fingers too) - thanks! But at least I have understood a bit more about Monads: It is just about avoiding to explicitely type all the parameters. But at the same time this is possible without Monads. I guess I still miss something.<p>Thanks again for your code. I like Haskell, because the code appears to me beautiful, concise but not ugly and when trying to unwind all the details everything seems to fit, there are no contradictions.",1362861688

Averaged the ""user"" time for each implementation and compared the results. As input, I used a 2m:38.040s long song, 44.1 KHz stereo, converted to a raw file with 32-bit float samples, and I redirected output to /dev/null.<p>For the first benchmark[1], which was faster for LuaJIT, I actually messed up: I compared the ""real"" time rather than the user CPU time. But as I recall, the ""user"" times bore the same relationship, and there was very little deviation among the six trials. If you don't trust me, feel free to do a more rigorous test!<p>It's worth mentioning that the effect for which LuaJIT beat C was a simple gain, so what was really being tested was a loop that multiplied a bunch of numbers by a (within the loop) constant. The second test in which Lua was a factor of two slower may be more representative.<p>To build the code, clone the graue/synth and graue/luasynth repos on GitHub. synth includes build instructions, while Luasynth merely requires you to install LuaJIT and run the script.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://scott.mn/projects/luasynth.html#lua_beats_c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://scott.mn/projects/luasynth.html#lua_beats_c</a>",1362860517

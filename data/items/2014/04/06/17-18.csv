That said there will be changes if you&#x27;ve been using things like screen capture programs (x11vnc, ffmpeg to record your desktop, etc.).  There&#x27;s also the probability that when things first shift to a distro using Wayland/Mir for the first time, things WILL break, so unless you want to be a beta tester I&#x27;d avoid it for the first few months (or more) until things get more stable.<p>After that period of introduction though, what you should be able to expect is better ram/cpu usage for the display server (wayland&#x27;s architecture makes it much easier to offload everything to the GPU, X has some warts that makes that very hard).  Based on what I&#x27;ve seen there should also be better support for tear-free video playback and eventually possibly even proper NVIDIA Optimus support (and AMD&#x27;s version) which should help a lot of people with battery life.",1396807106

Perhaps you weren&#x27;t there in 2008, or perhaps you weren&#x27;t a target. But the Yes on Prop 8 campaign deployed deeply disturbing and hateful rhetoric that relied on the worst tropes about gay people--that they want to corrupt your children into homosexuality. All this wasn&#x27;t just to pass a law, but to permanently enshrine and sacralize hatred in the California Constitution.<p>Here&#x27;s a question: many people, perhaps you the reader, oppose Eich&#x27;s forced resignation because of freedom of speech concerns. Great, I&#x27;m with you! And why I think this was all a stupid idea that doesn&#x27;t benefit gay rights at all. But why are we as a society up in arms about this firing in particular? Why are we not focused on ENDA, for instance, which protects you from being fired for saying you&#x27;re gay? Why aren&#x27;t we outraged that workers (illegally) get fired for saying they want to unionize? Or, more tech-focused, people getting fired for shit-talking their boss on Facebook?

7541754,comment,7540712,7540712,1,0,danpalmer,,,"Ruby on Rails is a good platform for building applications which are essentially large content management systems, with very relational content. If you can break your application down nicely into resource/data models, then Rails is a great way to build it, and very powerful.<p>Alternatively, if your application is much more about processes, and data isn&#x27;t as important, or isn&#x27;t as relational, Node.js might be a better thing to develop in it. The main problem with Node at the moment however is that it&#x27;s much less mature than the Rails/Ruby community, and lacks the higher level frameworks like Rails.<p>I can&#x27;t recommend PHP for anything at all, unless you&#x27;ve got 10 years PHP experience and don&#x27;t want to learn a new technology. Although I&#x27;m guessing that isn&#x27;t the case from the wording of your question.<p>Some other things you might want to consider: Python and Django are similar to Ruby/Rails.

Even if they didn&#x27;t do even this, they at least confirmed them that their intuitions were on the right path, and without these confirmations they maybe wouldn&#x27;t have even had the courage to start their businesses.<p>And if the ancient Greeks would have <i>actually built that steam engine into a useful device</i> (even something like a powered fishing lines drawer of anything of even the slightest usefulness), I&#x27;m sure this would&#x27;ve completely changed the course of human history, even if they may not have found too much practical use for it. You see, once you <i>physically build something that works and is useful</i> (or <i>actually implement something that can be used</i>, in the case of software), no matter how inefficient and barely-useful it is, you actually seed and idea into the minds of all the people that see that device working or hear about it working. And that idea takes roots and very soon they will think about improving it and finding uses for it. If you just write about it in a book, even if you add building instructions and careful calculations showing that it&#x27;s possible, you get at most 1% of that mind-seeding power. Most peoples minds get primed to work on improving something only after seeing something that (at least kind of) works. It&#x27;s the &quot;if we&#x27;d only tweak that and that it might just actually really work&quot; thinking that most people can only have after seeing something physical that at least &quot;barely kind of works&quot;. <i>Very few people have the intelligence and imagination to get a theoretical idea and turn it into something that works, but there always some Gates or Jobs or Wozniaks that once you give them a piece of practical vision they can carry it on to something that really works.</i><p>I think that if the ancient Greeks would have build a steam engine with even the most remote practical use and would&#x27;ve displayed that &quot;craftmanship&quot; to the people instead of keeping it locked in library, the whole middle ages with all their horrors might not even have existed.

7541650,comment,7541004,7541483,18,0,twic,,,"On Linux, somewhat infamously, malloc never fails. It will always return a pointer to some fresh part of the address space. It is able to do this because, in turn, sbrk/anonymous mmap never fails - it always allocates some fresh address space. It is able to do this because Linux does not allocate physical memory (or swap) when it assigns address space, but when that address space is actually used. It will happily allocate more address space than it has memory for - a practice known as &#x27;overcommit&#x27;. So, on Linux, you can indeed not worry about malloc failing:<p><a href=""http://www.scvalex.net/posts/6/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scvalex.net/posts/6/</a>\n<a href=""http://www.drdobbs.com/embedded-systems/malloc-madness/231600776"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drdobbs.com/embedded-systems/malloc-madness/23160...</a><p>There are a few caveats to this.<p>Firstly, malloc actually can fail, not because it runs out of memory, but because it runs out of address space. If have 2^64 bytes of memory in your address space already (2^48 on most practical machines, i believe), then there is no value malloc could return that would satisfy you.<p>Secondly, this behaviour is configurable. An administrator could configure a Linux system not to do this, and instead to only allocate address space that can be backed with memory. And actually, some things i have read suggest that overcommit is not unlimited to begin with; the kernel will only allocate address space equal to some multiple of the memory it has.<p>Thirdly, failure is conserved. While malloc can&#x27;t fail, something else can. Linux&#x27;s behaviour is essentially fractional reserve banking with address space, and that means that the allocator will sometimes write cheques the page tables can&#x27;t cash. If it does, if it allocates more address space than it can supply, and if every process attempts to use all the address space that it has been allocated, we have the equivalent of a run on the bank, and there is going to be a failure. The way the failure manifests is through the action of the out-of-memory killer, which picks one process on the system, kills it, and so reclaims the memory allocated to it for distribution to surviving processes:<p><a href=""http://linux-mm.org/OOM_Killer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://linux-mm.org/OOM_Killer</a><p>The OOM killer is a widely-feared bogeyman amongst Linux sysadmins.

Apparently all modern unixes overcommit address space in much the same way as Linux. However, i can&#x27;t believe that FreeBSD handles this as crassly as Linux does.",1396805410

At first, it struck me as gougy and a way to nickel-and-dime the students; but I&#x27;ve since come around and realised that it&#x27;s actually a lot more equitable in many ways, and it certainly grants students the flexibility to plan the path that works best for them.  If you decide to spread out your classes and take a ninth (or tenth) semester to finish, the only added cost is room and board (which you&#x27;ll be paying anyway, in some sense) and the opportunity cost of lost work.  If it&#x27;s important to you to finish in three years, that&#x27;s doable, but all you save is room and board (and you get to start working earlier), but you&#x27;re not going to feel the huge pressure of $60K pushing you to rush through and overload.<p>Interestingly, when they made the change about ten years ago, they didn&#x27;t foresee the rise of students who would intentionally average 12 instead of 15 credits per term (which puts them at a 5 year graduation instead of 4), so there was some alarm that students are taking &quot;too long&quot;.

7541600,comment,7539006,7540299,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"Actually, what you&#x27;re arriving at is <i>energy use</i> per unit distance.  The unit of area result you&#x27;re getting (correcting from original content) is a misuse of units:  &quot;liters/100km&quot; is more properly &quot;liters <i>of fuel</i>/100km&quot;, where liters-of-fuel is a shorthand for <i>quantity</i> (that is, mass) of fuel used per 100km -- it&#x27;s more convenient to measure fluid volume than mass (though you&#x27;ll find that aircraft will measure fuel by weight).  And <i>that</i> is still a shorthand for &quot;energy contained per unit of fuel over distance travelled&quot;.  <i>That</i> reduces to energy/distance, or: ( kg × m ) / s^2.  That doesn&#x27;t have a unit applied to it, though it works out to mass times acceleration.<p>So, as noted, &quot;Liters of petrol&quot; (or diesel) are actually a shorthand for &quot;energy contained in a liter of fuel&quot;.  There&#x27;s an imperial unit for this, the barrel of oil equivalent, &quot;barreloil&quot; in GNU Units.  This is equivalent to:<p>• 6.12 billion Joules<p>• 1.70 MWh<p>• 5.8 million BTU<p>• 0.000107 Hiroshima bombs<p>• 0.21 tons of coal<p>• 3.82e+28 electron volts<p>• 1.46 million kilocalories (food calories)<p>So, a 30 MPG car (7.8 liters/100km) is burning 0.049 barrels of oil per 100km, or roughly 83.4 kWh/100km.<p>I happened to catch a recent video Robert Llewellyn posted to G+ on the VW e-Golf, an all-electric version of the Golf (previously the Rabbit in the US)[1].  He mentioned getting approximately 15 kWh/100km driving performance, with the manufacturer claiming efficiency as high as 12 kWh/100km.  This means that, overall, the electric vehicle is a <i>lot</i> more efficient than a typical internal-combustion vehicle.  Checking on Edmunds.com[2], the 2014 Golf Diesel 2.0L 6 speed manual is rated for 30/42 mpg -- the eGolf uses nearly 7x less energy (6.95x) on the road.  Mind that generating and transmission losses run around 30%, so the net efficiency gain is only 4.87x, but that&#x27;s still a <i>lot</i> more efficient than an oil-powered vehicle.<p>The eGolf <i>does</i> offer far less range than the oil-powered version, however, as a result of the much lower energy storage density offered by batteries over liquid fuels.<p>_______________________________<p>Notes:<p>1. <a href=""https://plus.google.com/114018232303831249060/posts/SLeXV2o4jzF"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/114018232303831249060/posts/SLeXV2o4...</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2ZDVfa3x7Y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2ZDVfa3x7Y</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.edmunds.com/volkswagen/golf/2014/?sub=diesel#specs-pod-anchor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edmunds.com/volkswagen/golf/2014/?sub=diesel#spec...</a>",1396804755

However, the code that I had contact with so far was functional, easy to understand and reason about, despite being written in Erlang.<p>-- In fact you could strip it out entirely, allow in-process &quot;mutation&quot;, and as long as you prevented processes from being able to share any data, you would not notice the difference, excepting that your code might get simpler. --<p>Erlang is a niche language, you can also prevent dangling pointers, that’s not the point though, people make mistakes. The fact that everything is immutable is very important in the domain that Erlang was conceived for. What do you mean that the code might get simpler? Are you sure? I guess it would get more complicated since you no longer have the immutability guarantee.<p>-- Erlang is programmed procedurally, with isolation between actors being the primary isolation tool. --<p>Says who? And which Erlang are we referring to?<p>-- In terms of learning multiple paradigms, if you&#x27;re already intimately familiar with Go, Erlang won&#x27;t teach you very much. --<p>It will teach you some functional programming concepts, requirements and architecture of real-world soft real-time distributed systems (given that you will not ignore OTP), the fail first concept. These are not light subjects. As I said earlier, I am very intimately familiar with Go. I contribute code to the project and use it almost daily, however I fail to see how Go would learn me anything about these issues, and this list is big and important enough for me so that it would make it worth to learn something about Erlang, probably not good enough for you and I understand that.<p>-- I have extensive experiences in both. --<p>Please allow me to have my doubts about that. What kind of systems have you built with Go, how about Erlang? Have you tried to implement 3GPP in Go for instance, how about Erlang? Are you confident that you could reimplement 3GPP in Go with minimal effort, and get back the same guarantees that you get for free in Erlang?  If not, how can you reason that Erlang brings nothing new to the table if you already know Go.<p>-- On the grand scale of things, they are fairly similar. Locally they have a lot of differences, but designs come out fairly similar in both cases. --<p>No, they are not. They are completely different, the only commonality being that they offer concurrency primitives. Again, what kind of systems are we talking about? CRUD web apps?<p>-- With just a bit of grease code added to Go, you can straight-up port an Erlang design to a Go design. --<p>Right, I am really curious to see someone porting a distributed Erlang system to Go in the same amount of code, with the same safety guarantees, with “just a bit of grease code added“. I am not saying that it is not possible to achieve something similar, I am saying that you will probably need a lot more work than you imagine or describe here, and your first attempt will be 50x less robust than the Erlang solution. Not to talk about hot code reload for instance, which alone would drive you insane. And I am not talking about some kill main process and keep descriptor alive, then switch to the process carrying the new version kind of thing, I am talking about real code swapping like the one that you can achieve in an Erlang system.<p>-- I think perhaps the perspective difference here is that I&#x27;ve also got a great deal more than just Erlang and Go under my belt. --<p>Yeah, I guess me too, the only difference is that when I say I have something under my belt, I really have it, unlike lots of other people that talk from what they read in the news.<p>-- You missed the biggest practical difference between the languages, which is that Go&#x27;s synchronization primitives default to synchronous and Erlang&#x27;s to asynchronous. I find that dominates most of the other differences you listed. --<p>No, I omitted that one intentionally since it’s a lot more subtle than the obvious differences that I was trying to describe.<p>-- As opposed to issues like garbage collection, which hardly even enter your mind until you&#x27;ve got a system larger than what your average Go programmer will encounter. --<p>Right, as I said before, you probably work with CRUD web apps (which is not a negative thing) but in my world these kind of things are of crucial importance. Please go ahead and implement soft real-time systems ignoring this aspect and then fix it later when you “got a system larger than what your average Go programmer will encounter“. I was actually talking about exactly those kind of systems in my first comment when I said that the two languages have nothing in common because, you see, Erlang was conceived precisely those kinds of problems that you take out of discussion and then conclude that they are more or less the same. I guess we can agree that for some systems you can get the same out of both languages, but not for any systems.<p>-- For that matter, my experience is that Erlang&#x27;s multi-node stuff is a bit oversold. --<p>Yes, if you build web-apps probably. If you want to implement distributed systems they are not oversold.<p>-- and I personally have had huge stability problems with Mnesia for years. --<p>Maybe, but without facts, means nothing. I could tell you that I used Mnesia in lots of systems, the kind that millions of people use, and never encountered such problems. So yeah, each to its own.",1396803888

In the early 80&#x27;s we had a Bell Labs/Western Electric Energy management system with home sensors and links to the electric and gas companies.

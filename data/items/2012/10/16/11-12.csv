I guess it would all come down to the jurisdiction, that seems to be an important point which needs to be worked out and made clear. Once there are a clear set of rules for determining that I think these cases will be much easier.<p>>> ""You also need to ask yourself how you think an attack by someone in Iran on the US should be handled. Are you happy with that being dealt with by Iran?""<p>Creating laws on a country by country basis won't work. If it is agreed that the computer crime takes place in the country the computer and person was in it should be up to that country to deal with it not the country attacked.<p>And, although Iran may not have a good record, if speculation is correct Stuxnet was a US/Israeli invention [1]. What gives the US the right to create/spread a computer virus and then extradite someone for breaking into their computers?

We're planning to support a bunch more services (in the US, Canada, Great Britain and Australia) in the next few weeks.<p>Also, it's a bit buggy (due to time constraints) and I'm not sure how well it works in non-WebKit browsers, but we'd love to know what you think.",1350388391

Not even looking at the amount paid by edublogs to host. If a warning is ignored you automatically dispatch another mail (and/or sms as some do which is even better). Then you block web traffic in the firewall, leaving :22 open so the client can repair if they missed the 2 warnings.<p>Depending on the prior cases for that client (or; is this client a notorious spreader of illegal materials or someone who didn't paid in time on numerous occasions) you send automated warnings for a few days if the content remains in place and THEN you can decide to (manually) switch of the server. Unfortunately bigger companies forget about client support / contact and that client is king; Pearson is not your client, edublogs is; you are supposed to defend them, especially lacking prior cases over a larger period of time.<p>If edublogs called serverbeach to explain the case, telling them they removed the content (from varnish as well) through the open ssh connection, the support person can immediately check and switch it back on. That's normal practice to me and any host who doesn't do that is not worth paying more than $1.99 for some experimental landing page/site which doesn't mean much to you <i>anyway</i> if closed down.<p>Sorry to say if this is how Serverbeach or Site5.com treat paying customers, I will never bring my business there and I hope others do not either to show that we expect better from you in this day and age.

4659198,comment,4658809,4659118,4,0,gilgoomesh,,,"I think Rentzsch is being somewhere between helpful and sarcastic.<p>Apple <i>could</i> provide newer libssl dylibs and programmers <i>should</i> link against specific versions. You could argue the only mistake in this instance is the existence of the generic libssl.dylib symlink which will need to point to 0.9.8 in perpetuity.<p>Exactly why Apple have given up on OpenSSL is anyone's guess (since Apple aren't saying -- hence Rentzsch's post). You could insert a conspiracy theory but my guess is that they can't be bothered curating and patching another OpenSSL library version since they themselves only ever use libcrypto.<p>Apple could -- and <i>do</i> -- security patch libssl.0.9.8.dylib. So while you will never go from 0.9.8 to 1.0.1 automatically, you could automatically go from 0.9.8r to 0.9.8s automatically.",1350385630

It's a helluva lot cleaner - every page on directgov is a mass of links to other places, whereas this one focuses much more on the content. The design is also responsive, which is nice (directgov definitely isn't responsive) - it'll look nice on mobile devices. The floating 'relevant links' thing is a nice touch too.<p>I don't get why the default font for the size is so huge though, they ought to make it smaller a couple of points.",1350385552

Its easier to spread it by word of mouth this way and easier to catch people who just show up because they heard about it<p>Having it in a public place with the possibility of food and drink is incredibly important<p>Do not publicize it to anyone but your friends and acquaintances, keeping it to people you know is a good group filter.  The way it grows is everyone who comes invites their friends too and you meet their friends, friends of friends etc...its a simple quality filter that can grow very quickly. friends vouching for something is the best way to verify that its worth your time as well.  To this end, twitter is easily the most useful tool for this type of meetup (this may be a chicago thing as all sorts of people flock to any event on the radar since we only have a few)<p>That said, welcome everyone who shows up.<p>NO PITCHING NO SELLING, HAVE FUN, good business relationships come from people you know and like not people you sell too and trade cards with<p>Have the meetup even if only you and one other person show up and keep having it, people will come eventually and even if they dont you still hung out with a friend for a while.  People get discouraged if you let the meetup lapse.  A new person showing up to zero people will have a negative reaction but showing up and meeting 2 people makes it a worthwhile night for them.  Meetups are like startups, sometimes in the beginning you just have to do it even though no one seems to care or be paying attention, hang out with smart/good people and the word will start to spread",1240105820

568986,comment,568535,568873,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"A significant portion of OCaml's performance happens because it infers types, including a big picture ""understanding"" of operations with higher-order functions, and all types are <i>hard-wired at compile time</i>. The downside to this is that, until what the compiler infers makes sense to it, it refuses to compile. Once it does, though, you've already jumped to something like the 90th percentile of C performance (and eliminated several categories of bugs), and once you're familiar with the idioms of its type system, writing the actual code is pretty easy. It's a very concise language. (I didn't really <i>get</i> the type system until I read _The Little MLer_, though. Same series as _The Little Schemer_.)<p>Also, if you're thinking of his recent article comparing Markdown-style text processors, that's a problem domain for which OCaml is particularly well-suited.<p>OCaml's optimizations aren't really an SSC effect, though - the compiler is actually designed to communicate about what it understands, and thus what optimizations it's able to make. The real danger with an SSC is that it does <i>deep optimization magic</i>, but in a way that makes you lose perspective of what actually made it possible, so making informed design decisions becomes harder in the long run.",1240105097

In some degenerate sense, this thing is a ""compiler"", whose input is supervisor-level x86 code, and whose output is sandboxed x86 code. You might imagine a layer like this performing all kinds of fascinating transformations on the input binary, ala JVM/transmeta. VMware's BT, however, is more concerned with preserving the presumed-good properties of the input binary, than with introducing new goodness of its own. This lack of ambition also had the nice side effect of making performance relatively easy to reason about: there were various things the guest could do to incur virtualization-induced overhead, but those overheads were close to constant per-occurrence, so you could just multiply frequency by cost to get a swag at a workload's overhead.",1240103333

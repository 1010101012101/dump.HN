It would take 100 years at current earnings in order to pay for its current value.  So, the question is:  will they double revenue for enough consecutive years to bring that P/E ratio down?  If they manage it, it will be a <i>very</i> impressive feat.<p>(for the record, I'm not saying it's a bubble, and I'm not necessarily saying FB is overvalued.  I admit that they have a lot of bright people and are probably the best-poised company right now to develop completely innovative revenue streams)",1337921843

4021969,comment,4021692,4021692,8,0,Cyranix,,,"I'm quite surprised at the amount of vitriol for DDG in the comments here. I switched many months ago -- probably nearing a year now -- and haven't looked back.<p>I definitely appreciate the effort that has been put into privacy and simplicity. The zero-click box has come in handy at times (though I often find myself clicking through the box anyway, in which case it's a glorified top result, and that's okay with me). My most used feature by far, though, has been the bang syntax, to reference the Java API or search HN or check Stack Overflow or pull up a Google map or explore Wikipedia. I think the bang syntax experience might be frustrating for people who navigate to DDG and <i>then</i> type in a bang query... but if you've got DDG set as your browser's default search, the bang syntax is a nice timesaver: open a new tab (autofocus into the URL bar), type in your site-targeted query, hit Enter, done. I save one page load every time I do a site-specific search, compared to what my experience would be on any other search engine, and considering the proportion of my browser time spent in searches, I think that's a decent amount of time saved. [I mean, there are people on HN who quibble over how many keystrokes they can save in their terminal aliases, after all!]<p>That doesn't mean I think DDG is perfect; my major annoyance is results from content farms (same as any major search engine), but I'm hard pressed to find a search engine that weeds out content farms without sacrificing the features I like from DDG. The name doesn't roll as trippingly off the tongue as some other sites, but is it really that much worse than any of the other search engines (or names of YC companies, for that matter) and does the name affect my ability to use the site?<p>As you hyperbolically express your disgust towards DDG, please remember that you don't get any points in life for hating a product that you aren't forced to use and that other people find helpful.",1337921070

That didn't work out so well, however we were using Linux, Apache, Perl and only some pdf processing software required MSFT at the time, and a free copy of Sybase (no, I don't know why that was our db of choice, and it crashed as it was the 'free' version, not fun being the new guy/last man standing trying to recover the db on live servers).

This is especially true if you have string variables and factor variables.  Matlab's great if you are doing matrix operations of clean data (and you don't need to do anything fancy in how you report them).  But, I don't find it worth using for real data analysis.<p>Python and R are both great, though they feel pretty similar to me.

This will definitely strengthen the case for python, but the availability of libraries in R is awesome.<p>Second, the community and help resources in R are amazing.  I rarely run into a problems in R that haven't already been addressed on stackexchange.com.<p>Perhaps I should be more proactive about asking python questions when I run into them, but I usually just work it out myself (which is more time consuming than looking the answer up online.)<p>Lastly, I'm not an expert on big data.  But, spending relatively little time with both R's bigmemory and Python's PyTables, it seems easier to get up to speed on big data with R at the moment.<p>Though I haven't met them, my sense is that Wes, Travis Oliphant and the other relevant python developers are putting in a heroic effort to get Python up to speed.  I have every expectation that Python will be my choice of the future.",1337920365

And this 'something' is their biggest weakness, they just don't know what to improve, on what to focus. Google's search is so good, that it's gonna hard to improve but still there are some fields where Google can be beaten (anonymous search, irrelevant results for longer queries because of SEO gaming/blackhat). Instead they just brought up a really ugly design and the user wonders all the 15 seconds he's exploring DDG why he should use DDG.<p>DDG has to pick one of Google's weaknesses and focus just on this and they have also to position DDG accordingly and communicate this focus/USP heavily. Otherwise DDG is like G+ to FB, just a bad copy.<p>I can image how hard it must be to build a search engine from scratch, there's just too much tech involved and crawling all the web could take months even if you have hundreds of servers (imagine: Google crawls even smaller sites with more than 20,000 pages per day (!), how does anyone want to build such crawling power with little VC money and some hype posts from Fred Wilson??).

There are good reasons why it does this, but it's crappy nonetheless.",1337918961

"" would be a separate step), and I'm done. And it's not just for maps; it's also local results, like when you search for ""japanese food some place"" and get a list of several places with a map and aggregated ratings. For instance, when I do ""japanese food place I live"" on Google, I get a bunch of relevant results with star ratings, and the best one is on top. When I do the same on DDG, I get links to several other restaurant aggregator sites like GrubHub, Yelp, Urbanspoon, and so on, plus one link to a restaurant that only lasted a few months before closing.<p>If I'm going to do ""map! place name"" in order to get map results, I might as well just use Google; DDG isn't adding anything. Google is a place where I can type ""thing I'm looking for"", and get, most of the time, the answer I'm looking for, while with DDG that's just not true.",1337918934

I never mentioned it.<p>What I'm suggesting involves no pledge from Apple to help me with any of my own software I install (BIOS, bootloader, OS, applications).<p>And as far as I know, there is no ""support"" for Apple pre-installed software anyway.  You cannot call customer service and get help with software installed on Apple hardware.  And as is true with 99.99% of software, it comes with no warranty.  So you really get nothing from Apple in the way of ""support"".<p>As such, I would ask nothing more from Apple over what they don't provide anyway.  Rather I'm asking for the the choice to buy the hardware without all the pre-installed software.  Simple.<p>Second, I do not understand your comparisons.  Automobiles and dishwashers?  Do consumers usually program those?  Is there a github for that sort of thing?<p>I'm talking about a personal computer.  The kind consumers have been programming for over 30 years.  iOS is built in significant part from open source code from CMU and Berkeley/FreeBSD/NetBSD that can be freely downloaded from the internet.  That same code, and much more from numerous thriving open source respositories, is available to consumers, too.  It is available to anyone, for any purpose.  So why is Apple making it impossible for anyone to use their own software (or their own speakers) together with Apple's hardware?<p>Is there a legitimate reason?<p>No one is asking for ""support"".  Instead they are asking for Apple to stop getting in their way and interfering with how they can use a product that belongs to them.<p>When you buy a Honda automobile, Honda doesn't care what you do with it afterwards.  They do not act to control which car stereo speakers you can and cannot install.  You bought the car.  What you do with it now is your business.",1337918920

4021849,comment,4020885,4020885,25,0,pash,,,"A poorly written post on a subject that is surprisingly intriguing when better elucidated. A study published in <i>Science</i> [0] several years ago makes for good discussion. That study found a systematic misinterpretation of the miles-per-gallon metric in the sense that participants consistently overvalued vehicles with high MPG ratings. They assigned values linear in MPG rather than linear in its inverse.<p>The study's authors told participants to ""assume you drive 10,000 miles per year for work, and this total amount cannot be changed."" The participants were then asked to come up with values for vehicles of varying fuel-efficiencies. That is indeed the sort of optimization problem people face when choosing which car to buy, and clearly a fuel-efficiency metric that puts the amount of fuel in the numerator makes the problem easier to solve [1] because expenditure is proportional to amount of fuel if distance driven is taken as given.<p>But in reading the article, I was struck by the lack of attention paid to the ""miles"" part of the equation. I don't fault the authors, but taking distance driven as fixed is surely an enormous detriment to the goal of reducing carbon emissions in America. Yes, reordering your daily life to drive fewer miles is more disruptive than simply buying a more car that goes farther on a gallon of gas. And, granted, once you've chosen your lifestyle, minimizing the amount of gas you burn as you go about your daily routine is the thing to do. All the same, it's ludicrous to ignore the basic inefficiency of the suburban style of life that dominates in this country while we wait for automotive engineers to come up with clever solutions to pricey gas and carbon emissions that are twice as high per capita as in many similarly wealthy countries. Surely living closer to where you work, using mass transit, biking, and walking more must be part of the solution as well.<p>Maybe houses and apartments should come with a ""miles per day"" multiplier denoting how far you'd typically travel getting to and from shops, restaurants, entertainment venues, and your place of work each day you live there. ...<p>0. <a href=""http://nsm.uh.edu/~dgraur/niv/theMPGIllusion.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nsm.uh.edu/~dgraur/niv/theMPGIllusion.pdf</a> [PDF]<p>1.

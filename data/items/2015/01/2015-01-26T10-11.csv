That will just make things more fragmented for people like Maurice who might want to be, for instance, mechanical engineers instead of programmers.<p>It seems like the <i>genuine</i> ways to address this would be:<p>* <i>Some</i> kind of telecom/internet access becomes a social right, provided universally.  The easiest <i>actual</i> ways to do this are municipal public libraries, open libraries at community colleges, and municipal wifi.<p>* Transit and mobility subsidies for the poor, or possibly just for <i>everyone</i>.  It simply shouldn&#x27;t happen at all that someone lives mere miles away, in the same city, from hackathons and other educational/career-building activities and yet can&#x27;t afford the trip.  I also can&#x27;t count the number of poorer people I&#x27;ve met who simply have fewer chances in life because they were born in a rural area and cannot afford to move until there is a signed-and-sealed job offer with relocation provided.<p>* Trades training and job counseling as part of the public education system.

8946410,comment,8944883,8945426,0,0,laichzeit0,,,"I particularly like an excerpt from Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s autobiography of when he worked at a printing press.  Apparently it was quite common to drink on the job for &quot;strength&quot; if you were a manual labourer.<p>&quot;My companion at the press drank every day a pint before breakfast, a pint at breakfast with his bread and cheese, a pint between breakfast and dinner, a pint at dinner, a pint in the afternoon about six o&#x27;clock, and another when he had done his day&#x27;s work. I thought it a detestable custom; but it was necessary, he suppos&#x27;d, to drink strong beer, that he might be strong to labor. I endeavored to convince him that the bodily strength afforded by beer could only be in proportion to the grain or flour of the barley dissolved in the water of which it was made; that there was more flour in a pennyworth of bread; and therefore, if he would eat that with a pint of water, it would give him more strength than a quart of beer. He drank on, however, and had four or five shillings to pay out of his wages every Saturday night for that muddling liquor; an expense I was free from. And thus these poor devils keep themselves always under.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/biographies/benjamin-franklin/chapter-3.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/biographies/benjamin-franklin/chap...</a>",1422269599

I have to include myself in that assessment, of course. But, note how we are all a little different. Or a lot. So I agree with those who emphasize attitude, although even in that there is a lot of wiggle room. What we have are anecdotes, not prescriptions - we can tell our stories but you know, really, everyone&#x27;s path to mastery will be different. Different drives, different talents, different happy accidents. But, much time, much dedication, much passion, and not only freedom from the fear of making mistakes but rejoicing in them - opportunities for learning, and the shorter term the joys of debugging and problem solving.<p>For, if one does not love the journey for itself, one will never stay the course.<p>For myself, I fell into computers as a career entirely by accident, aided by a perceptive girlfriend&#x27;s advice when I was down and out as a 2nd year Physics undergrad in 1967, forced to drop out by family issues. No degree, 19 years young, and basically a C student. She suggested I seek a job as a programmer.<p>Not surprisingly, none of the big 5 were particularly interested despite my perfect scores on their aptitude tests. (? what ?). But one passed me on to a different track at a sister company, and to my great surprise they hired me on the spot to debug their computers as they came out of manufacturing. I have no idea what they saw in me, but it was a revelation. I could do it. From day one. Room sized hand built discrete component monsters. Elliott 4100 series.<p>And ever since, that job included, I have always been surprised that people want to actually pay me to do what I love, and to ride out those unpredictable deep thought intermissions when nothing apparent is happening with me. That I am still fully employed, at senior technical levels, is I think a token of how I am perceived, and I take it t be my qualification for commenting here.<p>So. Passion. Joy of challenges. Endurance, persistence, and open to the luck of the draw wrt career path (mine looks like a classical Drunkards Walk - transistors to pixels, ALU to 4G graphical language design). Always learning, always doing new stuff, always going where no-one has gone before - and short of an academic career this pressing out on the boundaries has to be pretty special to computers.<p>And the tools. The original question. There is no prescriptive answer to that one. For every project, often even every phase, there are new things to learn and invent, and the invention part usually has to include custom tools. And, personally, I gave up learning the current technological SOA in tools just for the learning, because typically by the time they became the right one for a new task they were already outmoded and something else was in vogue. So my tool focus is whatever helps me do the work right now. Picking new tools and technology up quickly are the key. And I don&#x27;t think that can be taught. It is one&#x27;s mental toolkit that is the key, one&#x27;s habits and tricks of thought and problem solving in their most abstract meanings. And I believe only love of the work brings those forth. Because we are all wired differently, some more differently than others, and we all have different satori moments which result in the laying down of the memes of Mind that shape those tools.<p>In short, stay awake, and pay attention, and love what you do. The rest will take care of itself.<p>Oh, yes, one more thing. Think of the poor folks who have to maintain what you did after you have moved on. Or, as was my painful jab for this, even if it is yourself six months later. Style is a tool unto itself.",1422267394

8946281,comment,8938223,8942106,0,0,mercer,,,"I agree with you, but let me make a counter-argument. My apologies for coming across a bit pedantic perhaps, but I think this is an important problem.<p>Social pressure can have a big impact, and while it&#x27;s not the same as physical force (or the threat of it), I think there are cases where it can be harmful enough to blur the line that I once thought would be easily drawn at &#x27;physical force&#x27;.<p>There are areas in &#x27;free societies&#x27; where being openly gay, or openly atheist is legal, but is (or was) socially unacceptable. Finding work as a gay or atheist teacher in such areas might be close to impossible, but for various reasons leaving such an area might be equally close to impossible or at least highly undesirable.<p>As a result, there are gay teachers who, practically speaking, cannot be gay, not even in the &#x27;privacy&#x27; of their home, even though legally they are protected from physical violence. There are also atheist couples who are all but forced to go to church on Sundays lest they incur the social exclusion of all those around them.<p>While I don&#x27;t know if a state-enforced no-discrimination policy is a good or even acceptable solution, I find it hard to dismiss this thought outright. Perhaps it is.<p>And so in the case of Eich, for example, the only reason why I feel that Mozilla had the &#x27;right&#x27; to fire him is that I find it hard to believe that this keeps him from living a good life outside of Mozilla. But if society were to change and all companies were to fire Eich for his views, then perhaps government intercession to prevent this might be necessary.<p>Because yes, I do think we need to protect those who have ideas we don&#x27;t like, to the point where we might have to actively interact with them on a regular basis. In fact, I think it&#x27;s a good thing. &#x27;Good&#x27; beliefs should regularly be challenged.<p>That said, I&#x27;m peppering the post with &#x27;mights&#x27; and &#x27;perhapses&#x27; because I also see the drawbacks and practical difficulties of this approach. Forcing a Christian school to allow a gay atheist teacher to work there might not solve the social exclusion issue, for example.<p>But all I&#x27;m trying to say is that I find it much more difficult now to  take the stance that we should draw the line at physical force. We&#x27;re too reliant as humans on social contact and fulfillment to ignore the dangers of social exclusion.",1422266761

So we wrote an &quot;OLD&quot; command that simply replaced that value with maximum memory avialable - and voila, program loaded again!  I&#x27;ll never forget the joy of typing in that 10-line OLD command, loading up a protected game, breaking into BASIC, seeing that the game had been &#x27;wiped&#x27;, then typing &#x27;OLD&#x27; to get it all back again .. so I could save it to tape again.

First, it has seriously helped RSI for me.  About 15 years ago, I started to get warning signs that I was going to have problems.  I slowed down and implemented short 2-3 second breaks every 30 or 40 seconds.  I&#x27;ve been symptom free since then.  YMMV.<p>More importantly, when I intentionally slowed my typing my coding improved dramatically.  I went from short bursts of thinking followed by short bursts of typing, to continuous thinking.  I started thinking about things that I had never considered before.  Since I had time, I started to wonder if what I was typing was really the best way to solve my problem.<p>When I am coaching others, especially junior people with only a couple of years under their belts, I tell them to slow down.

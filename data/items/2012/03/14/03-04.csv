From what I know, almost 100% of the auto salvage places link into the same database. So if you come looking for a part, I can get it for you. If you call, come in x amount of days and I will have it, if its not already in the yard. Works pretty well, but shipping can get expensive.<p>As for new parts, the database also allows you to order those, it works out pretty well. There is also a very standard 30 day warranty on parts. I used to mess with people and tell them to up their warranty like the rest of the industry...<p>At any rate, I would learn some more stuff and then go for it. Definitely lots of room for improvement IMHO. The only thing is there are a crap ton of parts. And some of the compatibility can get confusing.",1331697446

About 5 months ago I left my role as CTO at Livefyre to build Fanout, a publish-subscribe service for the web.  It can be used to push data in real-time to browsers and other clients.<p>What makes Fanout special is its versatility.  As an API/protocol guy, it occurred to me that existing cloud push solutions aren't well-suited for building APIs.  For example, if you want to create and offer a real-time API like Twitter, Yammer, Digg, etc, then you pretty much have to set up your own infrastructure.  Also, migrating to or between any of the existing solutions means having to update all client code to match.  That's a very heavy transition cost, especially if you have any third-party consumers.<p>I figured there were probably other developers out there considering the cloud for push but having similar concerns about API feasibility and transition cost, so I've spent the last few months developing a solution that I now feel is ready for some beta testers.<p>Why should you be interested in Fanout?<p>Fanout allows for customization of the client/server interactions.  This makes it possible to:<p>* Develop real-time APIs using HTTP streaming or HTTP long-polling.\n* Migrate APIs to the cloud without breaking existing consumers.\n* Keep using your existing client libraries.\n* Avoid proprietary protocols and associated vendor lock-in.<p>Of course, if you don't want to futz with designing protocol, Fanout additionally has its own JSON-based protocol and complementary JavaScript library that'll let you get off the ground quickly and is on par with existing solutions.<p>I'm currently letting a few developers access the beta, so if you're interested, please visit http://fanout.io/ and submit your email address.  I look forward to hearing from you.",1331697197

Yeah CureTogether and PatientsLikeMe exist, but they didn't seem to fill the specific vision for a complete product I had -- which was THE location for people with a specific chronic condition to go. In order to do that, you kind of have to make a place more than a product. And my hypothesis is that making a <i>place</i> for this purpose requires the perfect balance of social elements, health tracking, and knowledge sharing (q&a). I can dig into it more, but the basic essence that as hard as some of the other players have tried, they still have yet to capture any Facebook-esque stickiness to their services. I believe that there is room for health software that does have this property. That patients really identify with, and will come back and use.",1331695568

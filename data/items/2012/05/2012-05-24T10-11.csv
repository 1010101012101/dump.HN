People just worked at the same desk anyway. The junior people (ie me) had to move around a lot to fill in gaps when someone was absent.<p>This looks to be quite a different approach. Lots of little corners that you can tuck yourself away in. I'm not sure I'd like to work in that environment though. A big desktop monitor is useful, and working with a laptop actually on your lap is really uncomfortable. I'd imagine that if I was in that environment I'd either stick to a proper desk all the time or find that I wasn't really getting much actual work done while I lounged on a sofa.",1337857095

You have a ""why twitter"" thing taking up the rest of the space above the fold:<p>""On Twitter, we tend to follow people we trust.

To my recollection, the marginal cost of each shuttle flight (additional consumables and labour) was on the order of $65M to $120M -- a seeming bargain. But the <i>fixed</i> cost of maintaining the Shuttle workforce -- the ""standing army"" of over 25,000 people -- was around $2.2B per year, which worked out to $300M to $600M per launch, depending on the flight rate. So in the pre-Challenger high-flight-rate days, it was possible to launch a Shuttle for around $400M total, but as NASA became more cautious in later years and the flight rate dropped, the cost of each mission climbed precipitously.<p>I believe you're correct about the all-up amortised cost of the entire Shuttle program. An expensive beast by any measure.<p>Much of SpaceX's cost-effectiveness comes from clever engineering, of course -- but a larger part comes from making sensible managerial decisions to minimise workforce costs. They don't split their workforce into umpteen zillion congressional districts in order to keep their political base satisfied; this minimises coordination costs and allows for a vastly more appropriate manager:engineer ratio. This has allowed them to develop and run the Falcon and Dragon vehicles with less than 1/10th the workforce that the Shuttle required. At the end of the day, that actually matters a hell of a lot more than achieving absolute engineering perfection.",1337854641

Judge Judy was precisely the sort of arbiter that judge.me aspires to be -- including the somewhat-misleading terminology about ""courts"" and ""judges"", even though the arbiter is not strictly bound by local laws but rather by the arbiter's whims -- also they probably excluded the $150 cost to bring the lawsuit, since they instead sold ads. Actually, if you told the reality TV folk about Judge Judy nowadays they would probably ask the audience to text in votes which would determine the ruling, and the ""judge"" would mostly be a mediator and host who would decide what evidence was ""admissible"" for the public's consumption or so.<p>Judge.me might in these respects be a difficult sell. If it is ideologically anarcho-capitalist, then that provides robustness against corruption: but it also means that your 'judges' might simply say ""yes there is this nuance in your country's law, but I don't like it and it seems too complicated, so I'm just going to ignore it."" There doesn't seem to be an appeals process if this happens. So the lawyers of large corporations might be very hesitant to turn over their contracts to something so seemingly whimsical. I don't know. I am not sure that this acts to further anarcho-capitalist idealism, but it will probably work for its purpose as long as that idealism exists in the first place.",1337854422

My goal was to get very early feedback from my friends and see to what extent the site would spread beyond my friends. I calculated that I got about 40 of my friends to Like my site (and Liking means that a link to my site automatically is posted on their wall, so that their friends can see it and Like it also). The total number of Likes at this point is 125 and has stagnated. Of the 125 Likes, 40 are my own friends, and 85 are people that are unknown to me. I have not done any marketing outside of the initial Facebook status update (there are no links to my site from blogs, Google, etc), so I am pretty sure that this can be viewed as a closed system with Facebook as the only spreading mechanism.<p>Now, to my back-of-the-envelope hypothesis: if for every Like I get, if that Like results in 0.7 more Likes every time I go one more degree outside of my own circle of friends, then the numbers would seem to add up correctly to the 125 Likes.<p>In other words:<p>40 of my friends Liked the site; 
28 of my friends' friends liked it (40 x 0.7 = 28); 
20 of my friends' friends' friends liked it (28 x 0.7 = 20); 
14...; 
10...; 
7....; 
5....; 
3....; 
2....; 
1....; 
0....; 
SUM = 130 (ie pretty much 125)<p>And yes, I can think of ways that this calculation could be flawed, but I am not looking for an exact answer; I would be willing to tolerate a fair amount of error as long as the answer is systemically correct.<p>Continuing on, and for lack of better terminology, I am going to denote 0.7 as the ""magic number"". In my opinion, as long as the magic number > 1.0, and there are endless degrees of circles of friends out there, my site will eventually take over the universe. As we all know though, those assumptions do not hold, so I am interested in finding out what the magic number has to be for me to be able to open up a Jolt Cola and sit back and comfortably watch the number of Likes grow steadily, and at a moderately increasing pace. Would the magic number have to be 1.2? 1.5? Finally, when does it go viral? 3.0? 5.0? 10.0?<p>I would be very curious if anyone else has done any similar calculations, or if anyone can reject my initial hypothesis.",1337853814

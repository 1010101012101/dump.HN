Having about half of your calories come from corn (as is the case for most people in the US) is not good. Using corn syrup instead of sugar as a sweetener is not good.<p>Diversity good. Monoculture bad. For soil and for the body.<p>For the individual, the early (grain-based) agricultural diet was starkly inferior to that of the hunter-gatherer. Once the population gets to a certain point, people have to adopt agriculture; the alternative is fishing/hunting the available stock into extinction, and then starving. However, agriculture can support a larger population, by about an order of magnitude. Having 10 times as many people, in mediocre health, won out.",1268755191

After all, the G1 and the MyTouch have both sold quite well despite being considerably less impressive phones than the N1.  IMHO, the Nexus one suffers from two problems.  One is that American cell phone consumers aren't used to unsubsidized phones and don't seem to have realized yet just how much they'd save if they pay for the phone up front.<p>The second, and IMHO larger problem is that there are no stores where you can go and hold a Nexus One and play with it.  If this phone was in stores where people could <i>see</i> it, it'd be flying off the shelves a hell of a lot faster than Mytouchs or Droids.",1268752125

1195839,comment,1193552,1195196,0,0,TrevorBurnham,,,"That's a good question, and figures are hard to find. Statistical analysis is a huge market; SPSS, for instance, was recently bought by IBM for $1.2 billion, and SAS made $2.3 billion in 2009 alone. But while those companies started out as humble makers of academic software, and continue to make significant revenues that way, they both found the business analytics market to be far more lucrative, so those figures largely reflect their sales of large enterprise solutions. Companies that primarily sell to academics (e.g. Stata, Minitab) are private and don't publish sales figures.<p>We think our most promising immediate markets are social scientists (of which there are about 25,000 in the United States) and stats/science classrooms. While the original concept was mainly aimed at researchers, we've been shifting more toward classrooms recently, based on the feedback we've been getting. The two products we envision—the research product and the educational one—share the same core, as far as the interface and computational backend. So, we believe that we can pursue both markets, much as Lingt (YC S09) has both an individual product and a classroom product.<p>I should emphasize that my blog post is in no way intended as a pitch for Theoryville reflecting our most up-to-date thinking about our product or our business model.",1268752086

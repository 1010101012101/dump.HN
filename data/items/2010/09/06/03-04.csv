At it's best, that world disrespects and ostracizes us; at it's worst, it seeks to exploit and even harm us.<p>TheProviderPage.com is a site planned and paid for by a provider to offer a safe harbor from that world for my peers.<p>Whether your method of running your business includes being a ""lot lizard"", a ""streetwalker"", an escort working for a respectable agency, an escort working independently, an exclusive mistress who takes on only one client, or a dominatrix who specifically does not offer ""escort"" services, you are welcome here and will be treated with the respect often missing in the real world.<p>We believe adult providers can make the best choices for themselves without interference from law enforcement on the one hand nor do-gooders who want to ""help"" us against our will on the other hand.<p>If you need resources and support to run your business, you will find that here. If you choose to leave this business, we seek to provide you information on the best resources that can assist you transition to another lifestyle. We respect each provider's right to choose for herself.<p>We vehemently oppose all forms of human trafficking and child prostitution. The victims of these crimes deserve our compassion and support; those who exploit others in such a manner deserve severe punishment.<p>While much of this site is addressed to women, male providers are welcome also; our only criteria for membership is that you are a provider. All are welcome to read and use our site, but membership is for providers only.<p>Welcome from Bella<p>This site was commissioned by Bella for her fellow escorts.<p>Bella has been in the adult industry for over 25 years. She has owned and operated escort agencies and also worked as a independent escort; therefore she has consulted with the finest attorneys available over the past 25 years. Bella keeps up to date on laws and what is going on in the media (see our news feeds) .<p>Bella's hope is that others can learn from her experience. I hope that other escorts can empower themselves, understand the risks involved and have the tools to make their experiences safer, and for them to be able to find support and fellowship from other escorts. And I hope the escort wanting out of this lifestyle will find some resources here that will help her in her transition back to the main stream of society.<p>The only requirement for membership is that you are a legit escort with a good reputation that I can verify. We have just started our journey here on TheProviderPage and have many more great ideas coming soon, and we also value your opinion as a escort so please forward your suggestions/comments and we will take them into consideration.",1283745451

The problem is this, LE is going to keep using CL as an escape goat, while they have no real interest in catching pimps expoiting teens, they want to STALK MIDDLE AGE CONSENTING ADULTS IN PRIVATE, because of their moral witch hunt.  We have street hookers in every city, they don't seem to concerned about them.  On top of the sex worker being criminalized LE often calls her employer and landlord when they arrest her, its like being the victim of a hate crime, where you hated just because you exisit.  We are not given the same sancation and protection under the law as everyne else, and they even wish us harm.  Why are we such a threat, it seems if they went after the predators and pimps with the same ZEST that they go after these consenting adults, we might live in a nicer world.  Also lets look at LE behavior, follow this newsfeed\n<a href=""http://theproviderpage.com/news/TheProviderPage-News.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theproviderpage.com/news/TheProviderPage-News.php</a><p>Here you will see how the chief of police was handing out crack to street hookers and then expoitig them for sex in lue of going to jail and the 2 cops while arresting a women on a online sting, they took pics of her naked with their personal cell phones while she cried and begged to get dressed as they laughed at her.\nAll sex workers are expoited, by their own persona plight, poverty, and how does society really think we will be safer if we become homeless and live on the street, don't you think we would be raped and become a target for violence because we have no shelter/safety.\nNone of these MORAL People who want to save us from ourselves are creating any services or safety for these women.  I just wonder why society seems to think its ok to treat a hooker anyway and that she gets what she deserves, she could easily be your mother, sister, aunt or child.  Don't be so naive that you think this would never affect someone you know.  The internet gave me the abilty to find safer, higher paying clients, that I see on my terms, without needing an agency to give half my money too.

1665804,comment,1665668,1665668,0,0,russell_h,,,"I've done some Android development and didn't think it was that bad. It was definitely something of a struggle at first (not the least because I hadn't used Java - er, a Java-like-language - since my freshman year of college), but it grew on me quickly and it didn't take me long to internalize most of the important design patterns. That being said, I've never done any iPhone development, so I can't really compare.<p>As to the phones themselves, I don't think its as clear cut as the author suggests. I bought a first generation iPhone, but when it eventually met its demise I picked up a G1 on eBay. The G1 was obviously pretty horribly specced, but I liked enough about it to eventually got a Nexus One and rather like it. Its lacking a lot of the polish of iOS, but seems generally a lot more capable. I don't know anything about the history of using a back button for navigation through multiple applications, but that and a few other things (the notification UI for example) really pay off for Android.<p>I'll probably get another iPhone at some point (I'm still on AT&T and have never gotten a subsidized phone from them - I got that original iPhone before they subsidized them) to play with development on it, if nothing else. But for my primary phone I'm probably going to stick with Android, at least for the foreseeable future. Its far from perfect but it works a lot better for me.<p>Of course I'm not at all your typical phone user, so what I think probably doesn't mean that much.",1283745008

Running a port scan and finding your ""hidden"" SSH port takes very little time.<p>Placing your SSH port behind a hosts.allow restriction ensures that you've reduced your attack surface to only the hosts (or networks) you've permitted.<p>Better still, set up OpenVPN, use its HMAC[1] support to stop unknown users early, and don't expose any other daemons to the internet.<p>[1] <a href=""http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/manuals/69-openvpn-21.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/manua...</a> (See --tls-auth file  option).<p>To quote:<p>The rationale for this feature is as follows. TLS requires a multi-packet exchange before it is able to authenticate a peer. During this time before authentication, OpenVPN is allocating resources (memory and CPU) to this potential peer. The potential peer is also exposing many parts of OpenVPN and the OpenSSL library to the packets it is sending. Most successful network attacks today seek to either exploit bugs in programs (such as buffer overflow attacks) or force a program to consume so many resources that it becomes unusable. Of course the first line of defense is always to produce clean, well-audited code. OpenVPN has been written with buffer overflow attack prevention as a top priority. But as history has shown, many of the most widely used network applications have, from time to time, fallen to buffer overflow attacks.<p>So as a second line of defense, OpenVPN offers this special layer of authentication on top of the TLS control channel so that every packet on the control channel is authenticated by an HMAC signature and a unique ID for replay protection. This signature will also help protect against DoS (Denial of Service) attacks. An important rule of thumb in reducing vulnerability to DoS attacks is to minimize the amount of resources a potential, but as yet unauthenticated, client is able to consume.<p>--tls-auth does this by signing every TLS control channel packet with an HMAC signature, including packets which are sent before the TLS level has had a chance to authenticate the peer. The result is that packets without the correct signature can be dropped immediately upon reception, before they have a chance to consume additional system resources such as by initiating a TLS handshake.",1283743963

When you cut it open you get several plastic bags and small cardboard boxes. The flameless heater is just another empty looking plastic bag (lower left in the picture). Inside the boxes are the main parts of the meal inside of sealed tin lined bags (think of them like a flexible can) -- I think the food is pasteurized for long shelf-life.<p>To heat up the food, you put a little water in the heater bag and close it up. You then put one of the courses and the heater bag together into one of the cardboard boxes and the reaction will kick in in a sec and make the heater bag really hot. You wait a couple minutes while it heats up the food and then you can take it out and eat a hot meal. If there are two courses you can then repeat (the heater bag will stay hot for quite a while). Or you can try and heat up some water for instant coffee.<p>Most of the meals also come with a little salt/pepper and Tabasco sauce so you can season to taste (which really helps with the omelet meal which I think they got rid of).<p>Most everything else is designed not to need heating, it's like crackers and peanut butter or something else. There's usually a sports/electrolyte drink or some kind of drink mix fortified with vitamins and such.<p>One thing that the military is really proud of is that these things have like a 3 year shelf life without the use of preservatives.<p>You can actually buy civilian versions (without the heater) <a href=""http://www.mreinfo.com/civilian/mre/civilian-mres.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mreinfo.com/civilian/mre/civilian-mres.html</a>",1283743906

I have trouble seeing how that equates to an ""application server"" — but let's put that aside as a difference of perspective. Attacks like Slowloris are very much based on exploiting rate-limiting vulnerabilities in the application layer.<p>And rate limiting by accepting less — as neat as your Node.js hack is — explicitly opens up Node.js to this vulnerability. The vast majority of load balancers will just pass the request onto Node.js. Not to mention the bizarre nature of a setup where you ""push back"" to a load balancer sitting in front of a rate limiter?? If your backend resource can only handle connection rates less than what an individual Node.js server can process, then why is there a load balancer in front??<p>Even just looking at the situations where one has apache/nginx sitting in front of the Node.js server — both of them will happily pass on all Slowloris-like requests. So if you had maxClients set to 100 and an attacker decides to spend 30 minutes sending you the 100 requests, the rest of your users will be shit out of luck during this time period.<p>The initial approach you took to rate limiting would've prevented such a vulnerability. That is, accept and parse the request before queueing it to access the limited backend resource. But by limiting accept(), slow requests will quite easily bring your system to a halt. You could've avoided this by doing the rate-limiting <i>after</i> the request has been accepted and parsed.<p>I apologise if I haven't been as clear in my explanation as I could've been — but I would strongly recommend against rate limiting by accepting less.

I coded both up ways up, we played with both -- and we were still on opposite sides of the fence.<p>In this particular case, we ended up throwing both our solutions out the window and found something better, that we both agreed on. Unfortunately, it doesn't work out that easily.",1283742028

So startup purchasing will go down as markets reduce to more sane levels, meaning that gambling investors will find something new to put their money in, and all your built to flip startups will leave a lot of people flipping burgers.<p>I guess it's time to start building features for solar panels, but that's where the gamblers are going to be heading towards.",1224158338

I gave my short name and voila I have an account.<p>Now there is a lot of data collected and google is picking it up. I want to change my username to my full name which I use every where else. How about an option to migrate or change visible username if they are not already taken.",1224158164

334337,comment,334326,334326,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"So Stackoverflow is a relevant community now? Huh....<p>Anyway, I suppose it depends on the type of job you're after. Want a position in the FBI as a spy? Probably not gonna happen if you're a twitter junkie, I'd guess. Want a job as a web developer? Probably more likely to happen if the employer thinks you have your ""finger on the pulse"".<p>I think that, as long as you don't have stupid things on the web that make you look unprofessional, you're okay.",1224157502

I mean <i>what was</i> Chick Corea thinking in the 80s?!  :-)<p>That said, I think the point stands, and that's why there's not a strong correlation between greatness in the arts and salary.  The great artistic minds, even when producing stuff that I feel like was below par for their work, were doing so out of a genuine desire to do something important, even if they didn't have a perfect batting average.  Similarly, those who were driven by that desire didn't cave just because they weren't commercial successes.",1224157435

203134,comment,202096,202300,0,0,whacked_new,,,"This is an interesting observation. I don't watch basketball, but usually when I watch sports, I watch for skill, and don't really care who is performing it. If you see a brilliant shot it doesn't matter who did it, so the names and faces might as well be blurred out.<p>That it would be unpleasant to the watcher if the names and faces <i>were</i> blurred out, implies that the celebrity nature of the activity holds much importance.<p>Haha, just saying, FWIW, because your comment was interesting.",1212051072

We have different interpretations of the same information. My other point is the firms that get disrupted always see the alternative as less attractive.",1212050263

One major sore point is video on demand, something like Netflix or iTunes Video simply is not available, and I expect the same problem with the upcoming Amazon Videos (their MP3s are also not available afaik).<p>Just wondering if any technical solution comes to mind? Could I trick those stores into believing I am from the US somehow?<p>Hardware is another problem, Pleo won't ship outside of the US.",1212050134

I don't advocate over-allocating resources towards a competitor who may or may not be a threat. But submitter is already losing business. It may be time to be aggressive.",1212050014

If they see you work with the computer, they are awed (and think you're a geek). It's the same kind of 'aw' as when I see a physicist work on or with a formula. For me it's total incomprehensible, for him it's easy as pie. Because many people are still mystified by computers, you are the one they call when something goes wrong. Repairing a computer per week means that once a week I don't have to bye a meal. It also means that I can be of positive value for my sisters.

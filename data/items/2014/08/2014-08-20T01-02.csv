I live in a medium crime city and every time I have to call the police for something they never really do anything except write a report and then I never hear from them again.<p>In one instance when my car was stolen I was victimized more by the police than the car thief.  The cops when they found my stolen car towed it to a lot and then told me they had found it via registered mail at which point I had to go pay several hundred dollars to get my car back that was only worth several hundred dollars to begin with.  Also couldn&#x27;t just write it off and leave it because they would still come after me for the towing and storage fee which was $50 per day.  On top of that when I went to get the car the employees at the police station were _literally_ illiterate and made so many errors in transcribing my name and VIN number onto the vehicle release form that the towing company questioned whether it was actually my car!<p>In another instance when my car was the victim of a hit and run it took the police 4+ months to get the police report to the insurance company so that that they would pay for the repairs.<p>I mean if you can&#x27;t take reports and return stolen property efficiently what the heck are you there to do?!",1408499742
8200783,comment,8195223,8200608,1,0,TheLoneWolfling,,,"Thanks for the detailed response!<p>If you&#x27;re talking about an EROEI on wind of 18, and a 20% storage efficiency, that brings down the EROEI to 3.6. Probably more, as not all energy will pass through the storage. Still well below replacement. Or is that already factored into the EROEI? Does that include the unmetered power usage of windmills? If so: how? Does that factor in increased power-line losses, and the cost of building and maintaining those power lines? What are the details of the windmills measured? Is that real-world data, or simulations? If real-world, where?<p>I agree that current foodstuffs are <i>not</i> suitable for biodiesel. And raises food prices. But two things. One, I was talking about synthetic production. And two, that&#x27;s assuming current plants. Personally, we shouldn&#x27;t be looking at land-based solutions anyways. We already have space issues, at least at that scale. Look at sea-based ideas instead. Algae farming on megascales, that sort of thing. Much more efficient, much more land available, and can be situated closer to the equator.<p>I knew I shouldn&#x27;t have just said &quot;rare-earths and the like&quot;. I am aware that rare earths are a misnomer in general. Although... Neodymium isn&#x27;t rare, but the bulk of the world&#x27;s production thereof is in China. Has that energy cost been factored in? Much less the other costs? (Amount of radioactive release, etc.)<p>> As for synfuels: since you&#x27;re converting <i>surplus</i> generating capacity, your marginal energy cost is nil.<p>Wrong. Your marginal energy cost is the cost of building and maintaining the plant and supporting infrastructure. And even just that may be less than unity overall. It may be useful, but I&#x27;d want to see the numbers.<p>As for the trade you mention (&quot;Even assuming you&#x27;re building capacity specific to the need, what you&#x27;re trading is a non-storable, non-mobile, non-dispatchable form of energy for one which has all of those properties&quot;), I agree partly, but the question remains: what energy input should we use? Is it worth it to build wind generators or solar power stations? Should we stick to nuclear? Or what?<p>Fundamentally, we currently have a couple of different energy <i>sources</i>. Geothermal, direct solar, indirect solar (wind, hydro), tidal, &quot;biological solar&quot;, nuclear energy, and potentially fusion. Everything else is just energy storage. (Well, to be pedantic, so is fission and fusion, but by the time we&#x27;re worrying about those running out we&#x27;ll have worse issues.)<p>Current biological solar solutions are not exactly efficient. Your figures show direct solar isn&#x27;t either. Wind is iffy for various reasons - maybe not insurmountable, but still. Geothermal is great, but only in limited areas. Same with hydro and tidal. Nuclear is great, but the political climate is rather iffy to put it mildly.",1408499742

The &quot;assumption&quot; (and not a very big one) is that a kill switch will substantially <i>reduce</i> the value of the device, which will <i>reduce</i> the incentive for theft.   And that&#x27;s almost certainly the case.<p><i>&quot;Following 1991 crime statistics, over 2/3 of those arrested for robbery tested positive for a controlled substance.&quot;</i><p>What percentage of the population at large would &quot;test positive for a controlled substance&quot;?

If robbery is <i>working less well to get them their fix</i> then it certainly seems like they might be less likely to pick robbery next time.  For those that <i>do</i> respond by engaging in more robberies to pay for a fixed cost habit, they are more likely to get caught as they are forced to attempt more difficult opportunities and leave more of a pattern.<p>Flip it around.  Say phones were cheap, and someone was proposing something to artificially make them more valuable to criminals.

This is true regardless of whether there is police.<p>When you add police then the utility of everyone goes down, i.e the police may randomly shoot you for doing nothing whatsoever.<p>In the middle ages ( > 100 years ago)  the english tried making the punishments more severe than the crime, e.g hanging or transportation for stealing a loaf, but that didn&#x27;t result in decrease in crime, even if it made the crimes unprofitable.<p>If the punishment is random and unfair, as it will be, Then the deterrent effect is negligible because the probability that you will get away with it increases more than the severity of punishment.<p>Humans mostly avoid crime not because it is unprofitable, but because humans are mostly nice. Adding police to society decreases the probability that they will be nice.

(e.g. 2x or greater comes up ~50% of the time)  The multiplier is hidden, so no player knows what it is -- however they are able to bet an amount of money against it.<p>When playing the game, you watch the number increase from 1x until it reaches X. If you stop at X or less, you get to multiply what you stopped at by your original bet amount. If you do not stop by the time the number increases past X, you will lose your original bet.<p>I created a handy odds calculator here: https://www.moneypot.com/calculator<p>There&#x27;s no way to know when it&#x27;ll stop, so the game is almost all luck.

Which works fine right up until you have to scale your application to more than one server. Now you have to deal with the complexity of keeping a distributed system consistent - otherwise those REVAT URLs might sometimes return a 404 - or you&#x27;re limited to a single centralized link server. These are both scenarios Fielding was trying to avoid by including statelessness as a constraint.",1408498993

If there were no enforcement of laws by police, it would be in everyone&#x27;s best interest to e.g. steal. Regardless of whether other people steal, you&#x27;d be better off doing it. So as a classic solution to the prisoners dilemma, you introduce a force that strictly decreases everyone&#x27;s utility function. How can this be a good thing? Well, because it changes everyone&#x27;s optimal strategy from stealing to not stealing, reaching a global optimum. Now you&#x27;ll notice that this strategy only improves things if it actually changes people&#x27;s behavior. If people continue stealing anyway at the same rates, then things have only gotten worse (unless you subscribe to punitive, rather than deterrent punishment). So the primary purpose of police is deterrence through the threat of negative reinforcement, not &quot;helping people&quot;. Further, whenever police actually have to enforce laws, its a sign that something has gone wildly wrong. The deterrent didn&#x27;t work, and things are worse off than if there were no police at all. Of course, in reality criminal behavior has a lot of motivators and it&#x27;s not possible to change everyone&#x27;s optimal strategy just by raising punishments, so you&#x27;re going to have police enforcing laws. But there is no police department that is more successful than one where the police just sit around and do nothing.",1408497910

The main idea was to minimize the consequences of rare actions. So, even though train cars carrying lethal chemicals rarely derail, you build the train tracks so if one were to derail, say on a sharp curve, it derails far from populated areas. Or, even though nuclear reactors rarely release deadly radiocative gases, you don&#x27;t allow people to build shanties nearby, where they would get lethal doses of radiation if there were an accident.<p>You can&#x27;t get rid of adverse cases completely in most real-world situations. But you can work to minimize the consequences when the adverse case shows up. There are times when improving the worst case is pretty cheap, if you think ahead.<p>Policing is like this. The police very rarely need to use force (&#x27;rarely&#x27; in the sense of force used/interaction with civilian.) But when they do it makes sense to reduce the worst case: that the force will cause mortal injury. In the MOVE case, just wait them out. There is definitely increased cost, but it improves the expected value of the worst case by much more than the cost. Or, as I saw someone ask, speculatively I have to assume, on Twitter &#x27;what would you do if some 6&#x27;4&quot; guy was running at you threateningly?&#x27; The rational answer might be &#x27;close your car window and call for backup.&#x27; It&#x27;s never &#x27;get out of the car and shoot him in the head.&#x27;",1408497251

I&#x27;d add broken windows. One 2003 study found that “boarded-up housing” predicts high rates of gonorrhea in a neighborhood, as well as premature death due to cancer or complications of diabetes. (And murder.) More recently, researchers from University of Pennsylvania looked at the health detriments associated with vacant land. By their understanding, abandoned buildings lead to isolation and erosion of social relationships, mutual trust, and collective efficacy, which leads to poor physical health.<p>Kim’s team is focusing on the other side of things: the positive elements of a neighborhood that “might perhaps be protective or even enhancing of health.&quot; For a young scientist, Kim is precociously well versed in the language of hedging</i><p>So, what gives? I am baffled as to why this is not being discussed in earnest as a piece on research into health factors but is being talked about like it is a criticism of the social climate of HN and the social skills of its members.",1408496574

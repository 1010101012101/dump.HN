334280,comment,333359,334241,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Yeah, though they can invest in many high risk VC funds much the way VCs invest in many high-risk startups. Harvard's endowment, for instance, is ~$35 billion. They're risk-tolerant on a level that Sequoia can only have wet dreams about.<p>So though VCs will be less risk-tolerant due to sample size than entrepreneurs, LPs will be that much less than VCs. Even the best VC firm is only a few poorly-performing funds away from the scrap heap.",1224149837

A lot of time they don't have to prove themselves for a long time, certainly not in school, almost never in certain bureaucratic blobs, and when the consequences come for them... often they come for us as well.... see any massively incompetent's screw up that cost us all dearly.",1224149568

It drew these tree like graphs and evolved them over time according to some evironmental parameters (can't remember exactly. Was a preference for certain angles in composition). Very interesting. Was facinating at how ""biological"" the end products were. They were very reminicient of forms in nature.",1224148698
334272,comment,333169,334138,0,0,jbert,,,"> I don't really think that this explains the paper mill business, but you could make the argument.<p>I was thinking along those lines (then thought it relevant to the way students are judged too, as well as coders). Teaching used to be a well-regarded profession and has instead become much lower status (and low paid). Some random stats I googled for seem to support this (possibly biased source): <a href=""http://www.nea.org/edstats/losingground.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nea.org/edstats/losingground.html</a><p>I would think that you would be less likely to get away with the paper mill business if your teacher was a highly motivated professional.<p>In the UK at least, teaching is rigidly controlled, with schools' success or failure being evaluated according to various metrics. These are can be easily gamed (e.g. # of pupils achieving 5 A-C grades at GCSE. You focus effort on the C/D students, and push kids towards 'soft' subjects) - but only by teachers who are prepared to put the score-against-metric above the quality of the education they give. Of course, if you don't perform to those metrics, the school suffers (lower in league table => fewer pupils => less cash for school => worse education for kids), so you're effectively screwed either way.<p>Basically it's the old perverse incentive business, but yes, I do appear to have pulled a random rant out of thin air, so apologies to the regular HN readers. We now return you to your regularly scheduled viewing.<p>HN question: given that management needs info to make decisions and metrics are often gameable/perverse, how does one approach this problem? Is it just ""good metrics""?<p>> Second possibility: Jbert is paying a starving blogger a couple of bucks to write his comments for him!<p>Now that's a startup waiting to happen:<p>karmachameleon.com - ""building your online reputation""<p>(name appears to be squatted).",1224148662

Look at the small version:<p><a href=""http://cappuccino.org/images/cappuccino-small.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cappuccino.org/images/cappuccino-small.png</a><p>It loses any sense of what it is, unless you already know.  The larger version on the site is quite pretty, but I'm just not sure it works great as a logo.  Logos should still be very clear and recognizable even when degraded a lot (size, lack of colors, etc...).",1224148588

Darwin's theory implies that the weakest and slowest to adapt will be the first to die out. Thus: Drinking alcohol kills weaker brain cells and boosts brain performance.<p>Does that mean that women are smarter than men because more of their braincells get killed (or shrunk) according to this research?",1224147666

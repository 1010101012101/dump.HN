For me, pod casting is a new attempt on an old idea called ""push"" that wants to steer the internet towards broadcast rather than browsing.

161370,comment,161269,161297,0,0,alex_c,,,"My suspicion is that Facebook will have to change how online advertising works, or die.<p>Look at Compete data: average stay of 15 minutes * 350 million visits/month = 87.5 million hours / month in the US.  That is coupled with decent demographic data and ability to target.  How much would that much attention be worth in TV or newspaper advertising?  A lot more than Facebook is currently getting, I suspect.<p>If it can convince major brands that Facebook eyeballs are worth the same as traditional advertising (in effect sell them CPM, not CPC - ""Facebook is the new TV""), then Facebook will do quite well.  That's a very tough sell for smaller players, but it might not be impossible for Facebook.",1207948395

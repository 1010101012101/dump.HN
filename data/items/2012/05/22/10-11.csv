4007167,comment,4003565,4005467,2,0,bad_user,,,"Just as when committing murder there's a big difference between something premeditated and something done by negligence. The difference is that of intent.<p>The <i>data</i> by itself has no meaning, unless interpreted.<p>So the question should be, did the user have any intent on sharing/distributing the creative work to others, or was he just a user of a protocol he didn't understand, ending up uploading just because that's how the protocol works?<p>A lot of non-technical users do not know that they are uploaders when using BitTorrent. They just have a client installed by a friend and upon clicking a link the download begins, just as it would through HTTP or FTP.<p>And I see a clear distinction here between somebody doing that, or somebody that does it for the money or for glory. For instance we have a lot of prowlers in my city that sell pirated CDs at street corners to people that are passing by. The PirateBay is also filled with movies shot with a web cam in a movie theater, done with the express intent to redistribute those movies, either for money or for the thrills. Many times movies that were distributed as press releases end up on the PirateBay in DVD-quality long before the DVD was released. A lot of hacked copies of Windows are also on the PirateBay, many times with customizations and mallware included. And so on.<p>There are many shades of gray here. You can't put all the people in the same bucket. And I think that the people that should get punished are those that start the redistribution chain in the first place, not kids, not grandmas, and not the online services that act as the middleman (many times without their knowledge).<p>This is another reason why I think DRM is a misguided and broken attempt to fix piracy, when watermarking is so much better from all points of view.",1337682445

But as a guitarist, who spends a lot of time teaching others how to play, I could not think of a more misguided idea of what the instrument is about.<p>gTar works on the assumption that playing the guitar consists of putting your finger on the right fret at the right time. Imho this is as wrong as assuming that programming consists of pressing the correct keys in the right order. (million dollar idea: Teach you programming by putting LEDs on your keyboard! $599 only).<p>There's a common misconception that learning to play the guitar consists of learning where to press; after all, isn't this what tablatures are all about? I tend to put much more emphasis and practice on right-hand techniques. Other comments in this thread speak of 'early reward' or fast gratification; stubbornly trying to bend your left hand in unintuitive positions while your right hand cannot cope is <i>NOT</i> the answer.<p><i>Side-note for beginners wanting to learn the guitar: Learn a few chords you don't need a lot of them, then practice right-handed techniques (you can find plenty of examples off Youtube) religiously. Early mastery of this would rapidly give you comfort around the body. You can then get your gTar, read your tabs, or do things correctly by watching videos of your favorite artists and learn slowly to reproduce their songs.</i><p>Again, the engineer in me thinks this is an amazing project. However I would never recommend it as a guitar teaching tool.",1337680963

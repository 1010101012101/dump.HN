It's an interesting tangent in the broader field of psychology, just as Freakonomics is interesting the context of the broader field of economics.<p>Of course the greater part of caring for young children is unpleasant; it is not news that changing diapers sucks, that trying to get a 4 year-old to put on his shoes when you're running 10 minutes late is infuriating, etc.  But the shining moments of bliss are so profound, so stunning.<p>I hear running marathons can be largely unpleasant, as well, but the feeling of crossing the finish line is unparalleled.",1203778515

122016,comment,121673,121673,0,0,m0nty,,,"It's not really possible to introduce a Surowiecki-style ""Wisdom of the Crowds"" model to online news sites. In his book, James Surowiecki is very specific about what makes for a good ""WOTC"" poll, and what doesn't. In particular, he mentions cascade-effect where people tend to accept social proof about what is good or not, hence what is worth promoting on a social news site.<p>The question asked has to be very specific, and preferably incentivised to avoid flippant answers. ""Guess the weight of this calf and take home some meat"", in one case, or ""Help find this missing submarine and get a case of champagne"" in another. Social media sites have none of this, and they should stop invoking ""Wisdom of the Crowds"" in defence of their many eccentricities and aberrations. Google's internal futures market is much closer to what Surowiecki was writing about - it has incentives, it avoids publishing other people's votes prior to the outcome, and it asks specific questions.",1203778177

122014,comment,121890,121890,0,0,fiaz,,,"I have the following question for those that are advocating a tech/statistical/mathematical solution:  How many of you are individuals who are in the process of creating a startup in the hopes of getting YC funding?<p>The reason why I'm asking this question is because I had the impression that the articles here are more reflective of the VC/hacker roots of YCombinator (silly me!).  I also feel that somehow alot of the up-votes for this perspective is reflective of the notion that if you complain to PG enough, he'll swoop in and fix things so that all is well.  Hint: if you continue to have this attitude, then you will see your chances of getting YC funding (or even have them bat an eyelash at your application) decrease rapidly because your objection to ""fluff"" is so strong; do you really think anybody in their right mind would fund somebody who can't handle the ""fluff""?!?!?!?!<p>I recognize that there are many who have been suggesting solutions that PG implement (and to his great credit he has pleased many of you by expanding the leaders list to 100 now!); but I also want to know if your energies would be better suited in actually finding articles that you like and submitting those (in other words, being competitive), and perhaps even EARNING karma points (which translates into recognition as well).<p>Not everything is solvable in code and not everything that you do not like is a ""problem"".  I would argue that the diversity (which can be read as the mix of hard-core geekstuff along with fluff) is reflective of the VC/hacker roots of Hacker News.  Or in other words: break out of the box and have a multifaceted view of the world.",1203778168
122013,comment,121981,121981,0,0,fiaz,,,"NO.<p>The question should be restated:  Can Popularo become a better community than Digg?<p>Digg is a community, not a technology solution.  These two are different things completely.  Popularo is trying to build a community, not a competitive technology.  While I realize that communities can be competitive against one another (for example war), I don't see the two as competing for anything other than participation, which is something that is not exclusive to either.",1203778091

We can't smile, frown, applaud, backslap, suddenly remember a previous engagement, or cough pointedly here. Even a deliberate change of subject is hard to pull off when the posts appear in arbitrary order. All we can do is use karma.",1203777221

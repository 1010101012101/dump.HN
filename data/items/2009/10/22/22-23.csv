897889,comment,897665,897665,0,0,grellas,,,"I think the main point of the op-ed is, in essence, that it is dangerous to allow government regulators to become the traffic cop of the Internet.<p>That is the free-market case. You can disagree with it, but that doesn't mean it is based on lies (though the Google reference is a cheap shot).<p>It is a <i>philosophical</i> disagreement: one either has faith in centralized authority being benign and protective or one is skeptical of that premise. The free-market view is skeptical and doesn't just assume that government regulation will wind up being benign. Once established, the only limit to such authority is . . . nothing more than the discretion of the regulators themselves (what has the FCC done to warrant placing faith in its future decisions in this manner?).<p>Government mandates tend to morph over time and they are backed by institutional power as to which individuals are often powerless to resist. There is no gain in freedom when a society cedes control in ever-larger amounts to a central authority without proper checks on such authority. Again, anyone is free to disagree. But this is a principled position that reasonable people can adopt, and it has nothing to do with being a shill for AT&T or any other telco.<p>Remember, what government can regulate, it can also tax. Will that be a benign outcome if some future administration starts to tax the hell out of Internet-based transactions? What principled argument is left once it is ceded that this is the government's domain to do with it what it will (whether on behalf of some lobbying group or not), even if this means stepping on the property rights of companies or individuals.<p>I realize I am going against the grain here when it comes to what is obviously a tidal wave of emotional support for this initiative within this community. But what spirit of comity exists when it cannot even be conceded that reasonable minds can differ on such an issue?",1256252218

They do really, really well in sports. It's not correct to say these schools are dysfunctional; they're highly functional in certain areas. So I've always wondered about using the principles of sports in the classroom. Go same sex; do everything in teams; have teams compete with each other. I'd like to try that.

It is about a 5 mile hike mostly on fire-roads. It will take between 2 and 3 hours presumably.<p>I am thinking we meet up at the Rodeo Beach/Fort Cronkhite parking lot around 11:30AM on Sunday.<p>http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&lci=transit&hq=&hnear=San+Francisco,+California&ll=37.832158,-122.537642&spn=0.011016,0.022638&z=16&iwloc=lyrftr:m,0x80858f6037e34ee1:0x296088093fe4b59c,37.83238,-122.538671<p>There is usually plenty of parking. Also, the Muni-76 line runs from Caltrain, through SF, to the Fort Cronkhite parking lot. It is pretty convenient for getting to the trailhead. Details are here:<p>http://transit.511.org/schedules/index.aspx?#m1=S&m2=bus&routeid=25331&dir=OB&type=6100&cid=SF<p>Given that these are California hills, there will be some relatively long ascents, so don't expect a leisurely stroll for the entire time. Though, if the weather is clear, the views are worth it.<p>Make sure to wear comfortable shoes. Also, wear layers no matter what you see outside of your hotel windows. The weather can be drastically different depending on location, altitude, etc. It could be 40 degrees in the fog and then 80 degrees when we emerge from it, not exaggerating. Also, there really is not any place to buy things over at the trailhead, so bring food and water with you.<p>Hope to see you there!",1256250129

Now, of course it's a lot of fun. Of course it's infinitely better when you have an emotional connection to the person you're with, but that line about it being like oxygen - only mattering when you aren't getting any - is bang on.<p>So, if you are curious about how it feels and would like to have the experience, go for it.

Obviously as poor people get slightly less poor they will get a TV and will also do less of the other things associated with very poor people, like have too much children, etc. But there is no reason to think one thing causes the other.<p>TV is merely a mass broadcasting machine. It can be good if the people doing the broadcasting use it for positive purposes (e.g., education, etc.) Or it can be evil. You can just as easily use TV to start racial hatred or a war as you can to educate people about different cultures. Or it can be just a mind-numbing waste of time, which is the usual case.<p>But either way it is almost always used by a small group of elites (either government or business elites) to cram information into a large group of people, without the recipients being able to say anything or contribute anything. So regardless how it is used it usually ends up creating rather boring and homogeneous culture.<p>As such the Internet is endlessly preferable to TV.

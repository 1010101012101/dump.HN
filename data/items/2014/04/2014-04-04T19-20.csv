However from an architectural POV, Asp.net has always been a pile of crap because everything is abstract classes and sealed ones at that. Virtually impossible to reliably test. Interfaces? Never! Even System.Web.Abstractions stinks.<p>Having written a view engine, security frameworks, NH session management stuff, 100+ complicated controllers, action filters galore and thrown it into MVC I&#x27;ve come to not appreciate it very much.<p>And don&#x27;t get me started on Razor. Buffered rendering for layouts (bye bye RAM), batshit source, obtuse and non orthogonal syntax, poor runtime integration, absolutely no separation of logic and code.<p>I&#x27;m ready to move on.<p>Edit: just to add, I&#x27;m really liking Java&#x27;s design by committee approach these days. It&#x27;s incredibly clear that you need a lot of opinions to build a <i>correct</i> and <i>well engineered</i> solution. With .Net in general, it&#x27;s served up to customers ike a soup kitchen. Occasionally we&#x27;re left without soup though (WF3, Silverlight, early EF versions, WCF fragmentation, razor and so forth). The majority of the praise comes from people subjected to WebForms for years or even Telerik circa 2006 at the worst.",1396641591

The namecoin supply is being inflated at nearly 30% per year for several more months, then over 10% for the next several years. Domainshares only ever shrink in supply, when fees are destroyed as implicit dividends.<p>- Namecoin attempts to service multiple namespaces at once. .p2p is highly specialized for servicing the .p2p TLD namespace. The use case is the same as Namecoin&#x27;s &quot;d/&quot; namespace, which is used for the .bit TLD.<p>- Namecoin&#x27;s name registration price is fixed at any given time and is independent of the name itself. Domainshares utilizes an auction-like mechanic to incentivize price discovery for names, making sure the final owner pays what it is actually worth. The majority of the final cost will have gone to the network as dividends by the time the auction is over, with a small fraction having gone to bidders as a reward for price discovery.<p>- As a result of the fact that domains are expensive and there are dividends on shares but not domains, there is a high opportunity cost to squatting: holding a domain without making good use of it.",1396641463

They recently announced an intention to begin hiring married gay and lesbian people, if the marriages of those people were ordained by their congregations. This was described as a &#x27;neutral&#x27; position in that they receive (or at least used to receive) support from quite a variety of churches including Episcopal, UCC, and ELCA congregations which support and conduct gay marriages where legal. But WV received a severe blowback from conservative church leaders and members, many who began withdrawing funding and child sponsorships over the desire to include married gay and lesbian people in their organization. Since the majority of their supporters come from more conservative churches, they decided after only two days to reverse course, lest they would no longer be able to support their core mission: to provide clothes, food, and shelter to those who need it around the world. This in turn disappointed and enraged liberals who had only cautiously supported the decision in the first place.<p>My point is that enforcing litmus tests, as described in the article, tends to divide people who have otherwise mutual goals to make the world a better place.",1396641072

We examined a strategy called latency arbitrage, which utilizes advantages in access and response time to exploit price disparities caused by fragmentation across those dozens of competing venues. HFTs employing latency arbitrage examine current market information to predict immediate price movements, essentially computing the best prices available before the exchange has even had a chance to update its price quote.<p>What we found may be even scarier than Lewis&#x27;s book-selling punchline: it&#x27;s not simply a matter of the HFT crowd taking profits away from regular investors. Predatory strategies like latency arbitrage have the potential to reduce trading gains for all market participants – high-frequency traders and Average Joes alike.</i><p>Their solution was to go to periodic call structure.",1396640921

7533865,comment,7531429,7533065,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> How does the HFT know that someone is crossing the spread?<p>So suppose the bid for some particular stock is $100.00 and the ask is $100.10 in both Chicago and New York. They could be different between the two exchanges, but the prices between exchanges will generally be the same or very close to each other at any given time because any significant divergence is an arbitrage opportunity.<p>Now somebody wants to buy some shares of that stock in Chicago, so they cross the spread and put in a bid for $100.10. They immediately buy all the shares in Chicago that are available at $100.10. Now the ask in Chicago will go up because all the shares available for $100.10 in Chicago have been purchased, so now the bid in Chicago is $100.10 and the ask is, say, $100.20. At the same time, in New York, somebody wants to sell some shares of the same stock. So they cross the spread and make shares available for the bid price in New York, which is $100.00. That seller sells to everyone in New York who is willing to pay $100.00, so now the ask in New York is $100.00 and the bid is, say, $99.90. Both the buyer in Chicago and the seller in New York are still willing to buy and sell more shares at $100.10 and $100.00 respectively, i.e. the new bid in Chicago is higher than the new ask in New York.<p>The HFTer sees the new prices before most other traders because their computers are faster and closer to the exchanges. As soon as the buyer at $100.10 learns there is a seller at $100.00 or vice versa, they would get together and trade all the shares they want to trade at some price in that range. But the HFTer learns the pricing information first and, before the buyer and seller find out about each other, the HFTer buys the seller&#x27;s shares in New York at $100.00 and immediately resells them to the buyer in Chicago at $100.10.",1396640901

For example, one criticism I heard a few times at release was solved by a contributor before I even got the chance to take a stab at it ( <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/mithriljs/lGiNpog2mbc/ThZSdgw_nucJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/mithriljs/lGiNpog2mbc/...</a> ). I feel that community involvement is a really important factor to take the project to the next level.<p>- semi-related to the previous point, many things on the project roadmap for example are things that anyone looking for a side project can pick up and do. Some don&#x27;t even require you to know anything about the framework. I&#x27;m really put off by the high barrier of entry to contribution to projects like Angular, and I feel that giving people of all levels the chance to crank some code is a win-win for everybody.<p>- another related point: different people tell different stories. It&#x27;s one thing for me to put out a lot of examples and reading material (which I do try to do w/ the docs on the site), but often, people do things that I never anticipated. They can write better, more focused articles and share them with audiences that I might not have even known existed. And even if they&#x27;re just retweeting something I wrote, their social reach is different from mine: a lot of people that might find Mithril useful don&#x27;t read HN, but they might hear about it from a friend that does.<p>- a somewhat unique reason to Mithril is that it has a pretty stable core already, and the project needs to move forward in <i>some</i> front in order for it to be seen as an &quot;active&quot; project.<p>Also, it&#x27;s marketing 101 to stay on top of people&#x27;s minds. If they keep hearing about Mithril from different sources, then they&#x27;re more likely to spend a little of their valuable time to try it out and hopefully fall in love and join the community.",1396640901

The problem is that marriage confers a bunch of additional benefits (including hospital visitation and inheritance with less drama).<p>Additionally, there is no need to be married to have children, and there is no need to have children to be married, so the whole &quot;marriage is about kids&quot; thing is, frankly, really, really hard to take seriously.<p>So by supporting Prop 8, people were saying &quot;gay people do not deserve the privileges mentioned above even through straight people who don&#x27;t intend to have kids can have those privileges&quot;.<p>If this is really about children and families, where is the movement to prevent infertile straight people from getting married, or just people who have no intention of having children.

It was early fall and the weather was beautiful. On the way, I passed a field of Chile peppers and a crew was gathering to pick. It looked like so much fun to be out picking chile peppers in the sunshine instead of sitting in front of a screen in my dark office. So, on a whim, I stopped and asked the boss if I could get a job picking peppers for the day. He almost fell over in surprise but said yes, I could on Saturday which was the next day.<p>So, early the next morning I got up all excited and went out to the field. One of the underbosses gave me a bucket and explained in broken English how the system worked. I was paid 55 cents for each bucket of peppers and I was to leave no peppers unpicked. Ok, no problem. I was assigned a row and off I went. After about half an hour I realized my error of judgement. It was really hard work and not nearly as romantic as it looked. To make matters worse, everyone was way ahead of me and had to keep coming over to my row to help me stay up.<p>But I wasn&#x27;t about to quit and get laughed at. So I stuck the day out and make like $40. I then went home and slept for a day and a half and could barely walk. I don&#x27;t know what the point is. But this was a good article.

7533805,comment,7525198,7532287,1,0,xaa,,,"There are two possible scenarios:<p>1. An idea is self-evidently wrong to the vast majority of educated people; e.g., the earth is flat, slavery is good. In this case, the idea can be safely ignored because it has no political power.<p>2. A bad idea (from our perspective) has the support of a decent-sized group; e.g., opposing gay marriage. In this case, the <i>idea</i> should be vehemently opposed by reasoned argument and political protest, but I think for the reasons given above that it is unethical and unwise to persecute the advocates of the idea themselves. It&#x27;s perfectly okay to be disgusted with the <i>idea</i> of suppressing rights for a group of citizens, and to express that disgust.<p>If a big group believes something differently from me, there must be a reason why. In the case of the majority of Californians who voted in favor of Prop 8, they didn&#x27;t do so because they are fundamentally evil bigots. They did it (in the most common case) because they have been raised to believe a relatively literal interpretation of the Bible, which if read straightforwardly, condemns homosexuality and sees it as a harbinger of a corrupt society.<p>Aggressively coming out and calling them bigots and publicly ousting people supporting their viewpoint is not persuasive; given their worldview, it will only strengthen their conviction that society around them is corrupt and harden their resolve. If, on the other hand, we make a reasoned and compassionate case that gay rights are a good idea on libertarian grounds and as a way of maximizing the well-being of our fellow citizens, people will, and have, come around.<p>So, in short, personal attacks like what happened to Eich are neither ethical nor effective as a persuasive tactic.",1396640364

You can spend them on your presentation or you can spend them on the product.  Every hour that you&#x27;re spending fixing typos on the website is an hour that you&#x27;re not patching bugs in the code.

A project with less resources can have lousy presentation and lousy code while a project with abundant resources can be exemplary in both categories.  That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t use it as my ONLY method of advising decisions.<p>However, your method also has a fatal flaw.

I recently completed the class and project and have a bit of advice for anyone looking to take up this challenge on their own.<p>First off, a small note: our project used C to implement Scheme (a lisp dialect), so it&#x27;s similar but not exactly the same as this.<p>I&#x27;d recommend starting off with reading about the principles and coming up with a solution to each of the problems on your own instead of following a specific pattern as outlined in the book. For example, in our project, we decided to learn about the C basics, then just figure out how to make it &#x27;act&#x27; like Scheme if given an input. Eventually, we thought of doing everything in a linked-list style to make organization and recursion easier and more natural, but coming to this conclusion on our own was very helpful.<p>Another thing is valgrind. As far as I could find, the text only mentions valgrind in one paragraph, but it&#x27;s an excellent tool to check for memory leaks and errors.<p>Also, as mentioned in the book, a bonus is adding in GC. This turns out to be a pretty easy and a fun exploration of the different techniques available if you try a couple out for performance.<p>Our code in case you&#x27;re interested: <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/adamcanady/cs251_interpreter/src"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/adamcanady/cs251_interpreter/src</a>",1396639836

7546190,comment,7544187,7546021,1,0,pessimizer,,,"1) You can figure this out within a minute, though, just by looking at the wikipedia article about baseball. If it is actually a problem for you, in baseball, a batter stands on home base. Home base is the bottom corner of a diamond of bases, with the other bases numbered first, second, and third, from right to left. The area beyond those bases is the field. People tend to hit towards the left side of the field because people tend to be right handed. Important: the goal in the field or at the bases is to catch the ball that the batter hits, to tag a runner who is trying to run around the bases in order and then back home, or to tag a base that a runner would have been forced to occupy (because the capacity of a base is 1 runner.) 1st base = the first place every batter must run after batting. Right field = a lonely place, and a place closer to 1st base than left field, so not great for a batter to bat to.<p>2) Absolutely nothing. Sports analogies are usually pointless, but are peppered through &quot;manly&quot; writing. This article is about people who work with their hands, so to a Post journalist, that&#x27;s infinitely manly.<p>3) You&#x27;re lucky it wasn&#x27;t a football analogy. We know that other people don&#x27;t play gridiron football, but we love our hail mary passes.",1396875430

Voters go to a voting site, prove their identities and are given a key for a single transaction. This transaction transfers one voting coin from the ballot box to one of the recipient wallets (each wallet representing a candidate or a decision).<p>2. Network level. All transactions from ballot boxes to candidate accounts are public and verifiable using bitcoin protocol.<p>At the end of the voting period all the remaining unused coins must be transferred to a common wallet representing empty votes. So these numbers must mach: Number of coins = number of voters = sum of coins in all wallets<p>Candidate with the most coins wins.<p>The main benefit of bitcoin voting is that it&#x27;s not a centralized system.

7546124,comment,7544301,7544301,0,0,JunkDNA,,,"I would actually really like to see a lengthy investigative journalism piece that looks at all the factors that go into the costs of internet access around the world. I hear lots of hand-wavey stuff all the time about how Japan or Singapore have low population density so it&#x27;s cheaper there relative to the US. But that can&#x27;t be the total picture. Major US cities also have high population densities and that doesn&#x27;t seem to be enough. Different countries have also spent public funds to build out infrastructure which likely never goes into the quoted prices of access. Japan&#x27;s price for 2 gigabit (quoted here: <a href=""http://valme.io/c/technology/vkqqs/the-cost-to-connect-internet-prices-around-the-world/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://valme.io/c/technology/vkqqs/the-cost-to-connect-inter...</a>) is a good example. What&#x27;s the hidden cost? How much do taxpayers pay to maintain the parts of that infrastructure that are government owned? There are lots of countries that have higher tax rates than the US to subsidize public services. In some places, people are probably paying a lot for this stuff, just parts of it are hidden because they are indirect through taxation. However, I bet that&#x27;s not totally the case in all areas (perhaps in a place like Romania, given the comments elsewhere in this thread).<p>Are there any places that have vibrant commercial competition for broadband in the absence of significant government intervention? Are there places where because of government ownership of infrastructure in part of the market (e.g. fiber backhaul) there is increased consumer choice in providers, such that the fully-loaded costs are cheaper that the current US situation? We know from numerous markets that lots of competition drives down prices and drives up quality. The problem with broadband is it feels like a situation where you have a natural monopoly, so what is the right policy mix to enable competition? Or isn&#x27;t there one?",1396874612

7545969,comment,7545319,7545319,9,0,cyphunk,,,"First, I found that there are some true gems in the article and feel it is worth reading. But here is my contribution to discussion through some criticism.<p><pre><code>     In effect, hacking has arguably grown. Hacker communities, \n     definitely not. So what went wrong?\n</code></pre>\nI assume an American wrote this and I am wondering if the above is not a mostly US American problem. Of course what is a problem for the US becomes a problem for everyone else eventually in one way or another but at the moment... EU hacker communities are more fluid and inclusive of youth and counter-political cultures. And more often than not the Tenured hackers stick around to work with and collaborate with the new and younger. Though they have plenty of problems I don&#x27;t think lack of growth is one of them. There are some more inclusive hacker spaces in the US but most of the tenured and serious US hackers went commercial and stayed that way.<p>In the US context I agree with all the statements. Much also applies to the entire community as a whole. But what is missing is this: the community is just getting old. It is now coming into contact with what happens to any new field of discovery or thought: tenure and structure. It&#x27;s a problem with memory in general. As it is created there becomes an assumption that one should reference it. This field has history now and those that come along will be forced to consider it just as someone who studies photography has to think about Atget. This requirement adds latency that naturally changes the makeup of the field.<p><pre><code>     It is important to note that our capitalist worries are \n     more deeply rooted in us than might seem at first, even \n     in the most politically diverse people. Supporting oneself \n     is not easy, it does not come for free. Getting some \n     education, finding a job, staying up-to-date... regardless \n     of what your aspirations are, whatever you feel obliged to \n     do is probably a lot, already. And it likely involves a \n     prevalence of &quot;minding your own business&quot;.\n</code></pre>\nMuch of the article has to do with productivity issues. This is not unique to our field except that once upon a time the median age of the field was a teenager with lots of energy and time and now median age is older. It is true that the grind of day to day in societies like the US that hold capitalism as God makes it harder for one to have time for much else than survival. But 1. this isn&#x27;t the case everywhere yet. Just see some of the newer capitalistic societies in the EU that have not yet shed every part of socialist history just yet. (ahem, Berlin!). 2. One should also consider that we are just getting old. Want to solve these problems, be less freaking proud, more inclusive and bring in youth. It&#x27;s the same for every field. The article perhaps says the same thing but better:<p><pre><code>     If our thoughts on creating hacker groups were to be \n     summarised, this is how they would look: No one ever \n     feels like we do. They are not to be trusted and we do \n     not have the time for them. The only attitude consonant \n     to our search for a comfortable, safe life is to constrain \n     ourselves to our own limitations, ignore the intelligent \n     life out there, and surrender to the mediocracy that our \n     society has condemned our leisure time to.\n</code></pre>\nSide note: these problems <i>might</i> relate to the fields chauvinism problem. from my experience women are twice as likely to be inclusive in this field. there could be many reasons for this but it&#x27;s worth considering that the inclusive problem and lack of trust actually may be related to the male chauvinism issue.<p>Finally, that Anonymous and these types of communities will not have as much impact as l0pht, mod, lod, others... is <i></i>seriously debatable!<i></i><p><pre><code>     This article discusses why recently we do not see many \n     hacker groups anymore, and why the ones we do, such as\n     Anonymous and its satellite efforts, do not succeed in \n     having the same cultural impact as their forefathers.\n</code></pre>\nMost of the older groups such as l0pht spent their time saying XYZ company sucks because their developers missed a bug in a product. Whereas anonymous spends its time saying XYZ Gov/Inc/Policy sucks and we should riot. Which one do you think should have more impact?",1396872543

I like the clear focus of this; the product itself doesn&#x27;t require one to invest a lot of time, which is a good thing.<p>Just some questions:<p>- how do you prevent unauthorized snitches from screwing with your data? Wouldn&#x27;t it be wise to limit a snitch to a certain server ip?<p>- why only an iOS app? This excludes lots of potential customers (including me).<p>- why not offer an API, so we can securely fetch the status of our snitches?<p>I like the singular focus. Some people don&#x27;t want very complicated feature rich monitor systems. I can imagine using a solution like this, esspecially in those cases, where more feature rich monitor systems are not being considered.<p>Yet, you offer a pricing model that suggests something completely different. That you are a very complicated feature-rich monitor system. The value you provide at each price point is simply not warranted.<p>I doubt this will have a large uptake, but if it does, i&#x27;m the first one tempted to compete. The required architecture is not complicated enough to warrant such high margins on such low costs. Cloud providers, even the budget ones like DigitalOcean, could easily offer something like this for free to their customers.<p>Now, you could argue that the price includes high quality support. But that&#x27;s the not the audience of such a singular focus tool. If i need support, i&#x27;m obviously spending enough time interacting with it, that i would be better off with a more feature-rich monitor system. (which are available at similar price points)<p>Who&#x27;s going to pay 600 dollars a year for 300 snitches? To build this at scale may take more effort, but from the perspective of your customer .. wouldn&#x27;t most of them be able to build something like this for internal use in a single day? There are open source solutions with more features you can install with a single command.<p>I&#x27;m just wondering: but wouldn&#x27;t you have much more customers, and hence, more profit, if you would provide 500 snitches at 100 dollars a year? Or alternatively, offer the service for free, but just charge for the apps yearly? In the end, a single snitch will do at most 24 empty GET requests a day, where you store a timestamp. A single VPS should be able to handle 10k snitches easily. (less than 3 requests per second)",1396872198

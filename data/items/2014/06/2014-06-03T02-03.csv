Rare events happen, just rarely.</i><p>I&#x27;ll restate this hurricane problem. Suppose we&#x27;re flipping a fair coin. We should expect to see <i>roughly</i> equal numbers of heads and tails. If I flip the same coin a thousand times and see 523 heads, that seems &quot;reasonable&quot;. It&#x27;s certainly possible to get 873 heads, but I might start to wonder if the coin is really fair <i>not</i> because it&#x27;s very unlikely to get 873 heads with a fair coin (and it is very unlikely) but because it&#x27;s more plausible that the coin is biased. That is, it&#x27;s more likely that a coin that gets heads with some probability <i>near</i> 0.873 produces 873 heads in a thousand flips than it is for fair coin to produce 873 heads in a thousand flips.<p>In the context of hurricanes, if we assign genders randomly we expect <i>close to</i> equal deadliness between male and female hurricanes. If there have been a thousand hurricanes, and female hurricanes cause 87.3% of all hurricane deaths, well... I might start wondering if giving hurricanes female names somehow makes a hurricane more deadly.<p>Of course, this is all in the context of a uniform distribution of names on hurricanes.",1401763793

One of the challenges of long trains is that you can&#x27;t easily start them on a curve. As the front of the train is pulled it wants to &#x27;straighten out&#x27; and that would pull mid-train cars off the track, Such trains if they don&#x27;t use MU put locomotives both in the back and the front (and some times mid-train).<p>The advantage of standardized MU is that your engine is simply a control center (especially if you&#x27;re using power from overhead catenary wires) and any train of any length can &quot;work&quot; because the traction motors in every car are sufficient to push that car with some flexibility (some can push up to two additional &#x27;dead load&#x27; cars.)<p>But as others have pointed out, in the US the tracks are primarily straight, the existing traction motors in diesels system works well enough, and there is little incentive to change. That said, one of the options on the table for electrified CalTrain is MU equipped cars so that train sizes can be varied depending on commute load.",1401763743

I used to work in a railway museum and when we didn&#x27;t have an engine in steam we&#x27;d do our shunting with crowbars.  The technique is to get a 6 foot long bar with a bent end.  Wedge the point of the bent end between the tread and rail, so the &quot;elbow&quot; is resting an inch or two behind the wheel and the bar is up at a 45 degree angle, so forming a lever with a lot of mechanical advantage.  Put all your weight on the bar.  Eventually the car will start moving.  As the car moves, release the bar, slide it forward and repeat.  Eventually the car will be moving fast enough that you just run along beside it, sliding the bar forward and jacking up and down with your hands. One person can move a typical car on the flat, but if that&#x27;s not enough, a person with bar on each wheel will get most things moving.<p>Always have someone on the handbrake, as you will kill yourself if you try to stop the car with the bar!",1401762923

Reading this brings back the feelings I felt at that time; the feeling of being powerless to something &#x27;unfair&#x27;. I guess everyone had that one time or another. The reasons why things like this happen are debatable; maybe Google/FB has their reasons to effectively ban companies giving them hundreds of thousands to millions of $ / year (as these guys were and as we were). They are a commercial company and they can decide that and they do decide that. What the infuriating thing is, is the canned response communication. I cannot see that happen in many other business contexts in the world; if you are a $100k or more per year client, it seems totally <i>insane</i> that you get treated like that (actually; I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s legal in some countries). The fact you cannot even call someone to just tell you what&#x27;s up if completely weird. And the reason we will never depend on any 1 company for anything anymore.<p>This is smart advice always ofcourse, but, for instance, with adwords or adsense, for a long time you really didn&#x27;t have a choice ; the rest is/was just garbage compared. Adwords has gone downhill a lot and this is good news for Facebook, Bing and others. Adsense still pays most for a lot of niches so a business just depending on ad sales will usually find it hard to diversify.<p>Now we used adwords for dating as well when Google just removed our ads for various reasons they never told us about (they didn&#x27;t ban the account, they just told the ads would no longer run) and we did something which i&#x27;m not sure will still work but maybe it&#x27;s worth investigating; we went &#x27;local&#x27;; we found sites to advertise on and offline means in all parts of the country and got ads there (cheap) which turned out very effective. Especially on smaller local buy & sell sites / papers etc this returned far more than Google.

It&#x27;s nothing more than a signifier, of which people place a negative connotation on being a virgin.

I, and I assume most other virgins, have severe issues with dealing with social cues. When you say &quot;someone&quot; who is that? Is it someone at the bar? A friendly glance at work?

As someone who has been paid to write code in RPG (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_RPG#Example_code"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_RPG#Example_code</a>), I can confirm: never ever, ever ever. The best that we can do is to offer an alternative.<p>The <i>reason</i> why I put so much effort into Rust is because people who need to write the software in this space have literally no alternative that is not unsafe. Even if they cared about safety, they&#x27;re screwed! Say that they need to write a library that can be written once and called from any language. That means, effectively, that they need to write that library in a language that 1) can expose a C-compatible interface, and 2) can run without a runtime. Which means, practically, that their choices of programming language are either 1) C or 2) C++. Despite Heartbleed, nobody&#x27;s rushing to rewrite OpenSSL in ML. And I sure hope nobody&#x27;s rushing to rewrite it in Rust either (we have no idea yet how Rust would fare for crypto, and we need time to figure that out). But once Rust is ready, you will at least have a <i>choice</i>. Memory safety will no longer be something that you leave on the table out of necessity.<p>I feel like the vast majority of the new programming languages coming out these days were conceived to make programming more pleasurable for the programmer. And yeah, I&#x27;m a programmer too, and I dislike many of the languages that I am forced to use every day. But Rust isn&#x27;t about making programmers happy (although it seems to do that entirely by accident); it&#x27;s about making users safer. Fewer vulnerabilities, fewer angles of attack for the baddies to exploit. And hey, if it makes software crash less, I guess that&#x27;s cool too.",1401761192

It&#x27;s an industry standard, yes, as I understand it typical of a modern business unit, but that does not mean that it should be the one used by any new adopter. Indeed, BACnet&#x27;s been around for so long now (and has such poor takeup in the consumer space) that one might wonder whether a newer protocol is necessary.<p>As I understand it, BACnet has a number of drawbacks that make it unsuitable for this kind of thing. In particular, BACnet is not really plug-and-play (and is not designed to be), supports a relatively small number of transport protocols (one could imagine this Apple system eventually encompassing BlueTooth, ZigBee etc). Furthermore, it&#x27;s not really a secure standard as I understand it - access to the WiFi network would essentially give control of all the devices. Current solutions aren&#x27;t really much better, but it needs to be the primary concern (and I suspect that Apple have considered it). As one example, BACnet best practice is currently to have parts of the network that have to be in userspace (temperature sensors, door sensors (as opposed to lifts, aircon)) is to place them on separate physical networks.<p>Even moreso, it&#x27;s kinda usually implemented right above the link layer (which violates the hourglass principle, if nothing else), and there are issues that will come up in the near future with the alternatives (BACnet/IPv6 being an issue (i.e. most BACnet/IP devices will stop working as networks switch to IPv6)).<p>BACnet is probably fine in the enterprise domain, where everything is installed at building construction time, there are people who manage this stuff for a living, and things like airgaps are desirable as well as necessary. In the home domain, it&#x27;s at least overkill, and makes things incredibly difficult for users. It&#x27;s entirely fair for Apple to go their own way.<p>Trying to do a standards-based approach at the moment would be a <i>horrendous</i> idea - firstly I know a large number of companies to be trying to come up with their own solution at the moment, but secondly it would just end up being a standard by committee (with no real implementers). Let the competitors hash it out for a few years, and then standardise the best one.",1401761019

His idea of doing it with someone who cares is fraught, as there is a good chance he will get dumped and it will be crushing because of his circumstances, and because it wont mean as much to his first partner there will be a power imbalance in the relationship.

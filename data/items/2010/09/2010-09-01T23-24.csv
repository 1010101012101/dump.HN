The comment form after the article uses right-aligned labels.<p>Apologies, but these sorts of observations/criticisms are fairly common on HN (I remember someone saying ""they don't follow their own advice"" about the Stanford web credibility guidelines), and I have to say I consider them pointless. Observing hypocrisy and pseudo-hypocrisy is necessary if you're making a decision that depends heavily on someone's character, like electing a president, but it's almost always irrelevant when assessing the merit of what someone says.<p>People often have good reasons for not implementing their own advice, too. Maybe it was a higher priority for them to get the word out rather than make sure everything public they do complies with it first. Sometimes it's a cost-benefit problem: improving blog comment forms probably won't make much of a difference to their bottom line, but improving a new user sign-up form very well could. Comment forms are also fairly standard in what information they expect and in what order, so again, probably not a huge payoff. In Stanford's case, they already have the credibility that comes with being Stanford. Etc.",1283385241

I founded a Canadian company a few years ago (still going) and am friends with a few of the founders of those other startups listed there.  We're mostly on the same page: we're started here because we lived here, but being in Canada isn't exactly a hub for innovation.<p>One thing Canadian tech companies are good at is growing to 20-30 employees and selling out to a US company.  But that's very different - the innovation is sucked out in those circumstances.<p>I feel that the ""Revenue? We'll worry about that later"" attitude is somehow important for innovation.  Investors in Canada are really not one for high risk, high returns.<p>I mean, it's not horrible here or anything, but I really don't think our startup environment holds a flame to the US.",1283383575

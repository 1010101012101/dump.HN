5316886,comment,5315933,5315933,9,0,rlu,,,"This is one of the better negative responses to the video that I have read. And everything he says is true. However, I think there are a few things that are missing which I think are important. Firstly, I think he thinks the point of the video is to get more kids into a CS career - I can't quite disagree with that as it would in fact benefit most of the people in the video if that happened. However, I personally think the larger purpose of the video relates to the opening quote by Steve Jobs which goes something along the lines of ""everyone should learn how to code because it teaches you how to think"".<p>This is not to say ""learn how to code so that you can code in your job - whether it be a CS job or any other job"" - it's saying that people should learn how to code for very similar reasons as to why people learn math. There are many, many majors which do not require advanced math and yet many kids take Calculus classes. It's not because you need Calculus for your job: it's because learning Calculus will give you problem solving skills, reasoning skills, and other skills which can be applied at your job.<p>Then there's the whole aspect that, hey, you might actually have FUN coding!<p>I definitely agree with the author squinting at the ""all you need to know how to do is add and subtract"" and other things of that nature. I agree that is a half truth. But IIRC, someone in the video elaborated by saying ""it's all about breaking things down"" - and that is extremely true. Break problems down, solve each one individually, tie things together. That is basically how I go about coding everything I do. Relates very much to abstraction.<p>Finally the OP article mentioned that the video seemed to be deceiving kids into thinking that (a) it would be easy to get hired into a company like Facebook and that (b) every company is as fun as those shown in the video. As for (a), I disagree. The video never says anything along the lines of ""you'll become an expert at coding within a week!"" or even within a year. It just says ""you should try this out, start today!"". I would think that most people in high school would know that getting hired by ""a Facebook"" would be just as challenging as I would imagine it would be to get hired by ""A NASA/Boeing/Lockheed Martin"" if you're an Aerospace Engineer - and I'm not in that field. But what's wrong with shooting for the stars? If that sort of company interests you then by all means SET THAT AS A GOAL! But I reiterate back to one of my earlier points: this video isn't even saying ""get into a CS career"" - it's more of a ""this is good for you, and hey, if you end up loving it, there are some really cool jobs you have the ability of applying to"".<p>So, overall the post had some good points but it seems a little misguided. Frankly the author seemed somewhat jaded. I don't know if I'm in the camp that wants everyone to be forced to take a programming class - but I would definitely be in the camp that would encourage all schools to offer it as an elective. While I agree with the author that programming is not for everyone, I certainly think that programming is something that everyone should be encouraged to try out. Not because everyone should get a career in CS, but because coding might turn out to just be a fun (and useful!) hobby for you. And hey, if you do end up really liking it, there <i>are</i> some cool jobs out there. Just keep in mind they're the equivalent of the NASAs and Boeings and Lockheed Martins - it's not a piece of cake to get hired into those.<p>*small aside: I'm pretty sure any kid that ended up really liking programming would figure out that coding is a little bit harder than the video portrays it to be by the time they decided they definitely wanted to pursue a career in it. So perhaps I can conede the video may have a bit of a ""bait and switch"" as far as that goes, but the switch will likely happen before kids waste a bunch of time pursing a job they won't get.<p>edit: and this ended up being much longer than intended. sorry",1362376239

There will always be the silly realities and quirks of computer systems that will take some intense local domain knowledge to work around, and for that we will always need a class of programming professionals. But programming entails a hell of a lot more than the world of computers.<p>The words <i>program</i> and <i>procedure</i> existed before computers did; computers merely forced us to acknowledge the need for and develop a formal means of describing and discussing procedure. That kind of knowledge isn't bound by any particular class of machine, nor by any language. It applies to almost every aspect of complex endeavour. It allows people to think about how they are doing things. Just as a Karnaugh map can help a circuit designer see redundancies in logical inputs, a codified description of a processany processcan help people see ineficiencies and redundancies in what they are doing (or what they are having other people do).

And people have been fearing machine-induced joblessness since the beginning.""<p>What has actually happened is that as labor was replaced or reduced in one industry, jobs moved to others. The agricultural revolution reduced the cost of food, thereby reducing the amount of ""money"" that a human had to earn to survive. They could then be employed doing something else. During the industrial revolution more goods were produced cheaply, making them more affordable, and allowing more people to buy them. The industrial revolution increased production but still required people. Each innovation created a new opportunity that required people to do the work.<p>At each stage, we dealt with hierarchy of needs. Food. Clothing. Shelter.<p>The assumption made in the quote above is that there is an endless list of jobs, and that the fact that we've had 200 years without the end of society proves it. Analysis of the data, however, suggests that at each stage, the ""revolution"" has left less jobs available, and/or those jobs have paid lower salaries. The <i>trend</i> is that at some point in the future, human labor and, some time later, human <i>thought</i> will have such tiny value as to be worthless.<p>A robot or an AI will be vastly more cost effective than paying a slow moving, slow thinking organic entity that requires money in order to purchase proteins, carbohydrates and increasingly rare elements like phosphorus.<p>Just as for millennia, smart people have been attempting to fly, so too have smart people been attempting to eliminate humans from production. Why are we surprised, why do we deny, that they are succeeding?<p>The evidence is right here. Nobody here on HN is forming a startup to automate some aspect of our lives with the express goal that the labor saved be used to create new jobs. Nobody is saying ""My start-up automates X <i>so that the people who were paid to do X can get a new job doing Y</i>"". That last part is just not on anybody's radar. Does PG ask this in YC interviews: ""And what will the people who are made unemployed by your new startup do?"" No. So why are we surprised that the world is turning out exactly according to all our plans?<p>The article is correct and asks the right question: ""The jobs are not coming back. What are we going to do about it?""",1362375573

It's a nontrivial download for users with slower connection speeds, so you should really have better failure recovery than a simple HTTP download provides.<p>You should distribute it in pieces, or use bittorrent or rsync or some other protocol which allows correcting a bad block in transit.  Users should download a small downloader program which speaks whatever protocol, then the downloader downloads the actual game.  (Think about the way Blizzard does WoW updates.)<p>Checking blocks should theoretically possible using HTTP transfers with byte ranges, if you have a separate index file with checksums for each block.  That way you get failure recovery but serve your content from Really Efficient Webservers like nginx or Amazon S3.  Anyone know of any projects that do this?<p>You should also consider using a more modern compression algorithm like bz2 or lzma, if you have control over the application running on both ends of the connection.  I'm guessing you'll see these results with Zopfli:<p><pre><code>   gzip -c9 > zopfli -i1000 > bzip2 > bzip2 -c9 > xz   # compressed size\n   gzip -c9 < bzip2 < bzip2 -c9 < xz, zopfli -i1000    # compression time\n</code></pre>\nNot really sure about xz vs. zopfli for compression speed, but I'm sure that xz's LZMA algorithm gets way better compression than gzip for most data, due to fundamental limitations in the design of gzip's format.<p>The only real reason to use Zopfli is when the client only knows gzip compression and you can't change it (for example, many, many people have static webpages, CSS, JS, etc., which need to support several different web browsers as clients).",1362375310

Intelligence is not a magic number which increases in one way which allows you to do great things automatically with no effort. An average person (based on IQ points, which do NOT measure all the the ways for people to have potential for intelligence) can do far greater, meaningful things through willpower, and willpower is something we all have only still most people do not understand how to use it effectively. It's just knowledge, not innate ability. We are all very similar genetically and we all have very similar with our potential for greatness. Sure we all cannot be great in the same ways... like many of us here couldn't be NFL quarterbackers if we wanted to, but still ultimately with the things we want and the things we want to do the only thing holding us back are our beliefs.<p>Any kind of creative person who is great is not born that way.

Even people with extremely limiting abilities can use what brain tissue they have, expand their mind, and blow away all we thought we knew as impossible.<p>>Well informed is also a sticky concept, there is a lot of information out there. Much of it conflicting, it requires skill,time and a certain amount of luck to use the right information to make the right decisions.<p>Yes, so, be exposed to as much as possible, and think.

If we changed to zopfli, it would take 2.2 <i>hours</i>.<p>That would put a serious dent in our agility.

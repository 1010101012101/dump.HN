You're right that the bay area is ""different"", but that doesn't mean it's different in a reasonable way.  Most people really can't afford to own property here, by traditional standards.<p>Also, I'd like to point out that this woman took out an <i>interest-only</i> loan for the bulk of her debt, skimped on the deposit, and secured with another loan.  Even if we use your standard (45% of net income), there's no way that she could afford the property.",1234000792

471005,comment,468807,470256,0,0,barrkel,,,"No - not tail call - event driven callback model I/O <i>is</i> continuation-passing style (CPS). The two models are equivalent. Code written in the thread idiom can, in principle, be mechanically transformed into CPS and thereby use the event-driven callback model.<p>In the event callback style, the state that would otherwise be on the stack is held in the callback closure.<p>In the .NET space, F# does this transformation automatically with what it calls asynchronous workflows (<a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/10/11/introducing-f-asynchronous-workflows.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/10/11/introducing-f...</a>).

If they approach their task appropriately then they will be the catalysts that generate the questions ""who?, what?, why? and why? again"" that ferment change that will be aligned with the true direction of a business. Indeed that can actualy re-direct the path of a business towards it's goals.",1233999966

470993,comment,470798,470824,0,0,zain,,,"I'm not sure where you're getting your 3x income numbers from, but they're simply ludicrous. With a mortgage of 3x your income, your mortgage will be less than 20% of your salary. For example, with an $85000/yr income, you earn about $5300 post-tax per month, and your mortgage payment is only $1350. If you consider home owning to be important to you, surely you can afford paying more than that for your mortgage.<p>Furthermore, it is impossible to find a home in the bay area for under $600,000. I'm certain that those starter homes are not being occupied by high net-worth individuals with $200,000/yr salaries.<p>I have been told that your monthly payments should not be more than 45% of your monthly household post-tax income. That comes out to a mortgage that can be about 5x your income. With those numbers, the lady in the article should've had a household (her + her husband) income of about $150,000/yr.<p>I'm a recent buyer of a $625,000 home with a $85,000/yr salary and I have no problems keeping up with my payments and establishing an emergency fund.",1233999111

470985,comment,470485,470485,0,0,petercooper,,,"redo, in the Fibonacci example, is still iterative - it's presented as a third way, when it's just a cruftier way of being iterative. If you remove the cruft of the lambda and the redo, you end up with:<p><pre><code>  def fib(i)\n    n, result = 1, 0\n    while i != -1\n      i, n, result = i - 1, n + result, n\n    end\n    result\n  end\n</code></pre>\nCleaner, faster (by 10% on Ruby 1.8) and shorter, but certainly iterative.<p>(Separate to this, the fib routines shown produce incorrect results - my example above maintains this, just for comparison with the original code. fib(10) is 55 not 89 - it's one off in its input.)",1233998018

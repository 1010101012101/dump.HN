Since time appears for the most part to be continuous, that's not going to get you a tick, nothing for the ants to synchronise their clocks to.<p>If being in the same frame of reference was enough, then you could just put two computers in the same room and call it a synchronised system.",1214895525

You wouldn't need higher critical mass if you have just implemented a pagerank equivalent as opposed to recommendations.<p>You can make a page without recommendations the default, at least until you acquire critical mass. You can just have a ""personalized"" slider defaulting to no personalization.",1214894560

232767,comment,232703,232726,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"Louis Savain's ""arguments"", which he likes to claim ""over people's heads"", are mostly just examples of the Argument from Intimidation fallacy.  Ie, ""only an idiot would disagree with this"".  (Complete with overly complicated and inadequately labeled diagrams, to try to make you feel stupid, so that you'll more susceptible to this tactic.)  I don't buy it for a second.  I've built logic circuits.  I've written assembly code.  He hates computer languages because he's full of shit; there's no polite way to put it.<p>Greater parallelism in hardware is a fine goal.  But it's madness to write programs for processors. If humans can't read it, then your program is crap.  There are no exceptions.<p>We have these many processors.  The task is not to make parallelism fit on a single chip.  The task is to develop practices and languages that allow humans to write code for other humans, in such a way that programs also incidentally take advantage of the many (threaded, algorithmic) von Neuman machines that we have wired together in modern computers.<p>In just a few years, 8 or 16 (or more!) cores won't be a big deal.  When you have 50 single-threaded cores, you have a different kind of computer than what we're used to today.  We already have languages that take advantage of these features pretty well.  They're not hugely popular yet, but they're also not being taught at universities, and we're not yet at a point where they're terribly necessary.<p>The COSA project is imaginary yak shaving of the worst sort.  If he was half the hacker he claimed to be, he'd be writing programs instead of crackpot papers.  Where is all the useful error-free software that COSA makes it so easy to create?  Where's the web server he built with it, or the word processor?  Hell, I'd be impressed with a 4-function calculator!  Show me the goods, and I'll take it seriously.  I'll even join the beta and play around with the stuff.<p>Until then, in my view, Savain is on par with the muttering bum at the bus stop.",1214893739

232762,comment,232143,232143,0,0,cmos,,,"look up ""faulty capacitors"" in google.  multiply by 8000.  But we got through it.  We repaired or replaced each one as my life rode along the bell curve of faulty capacitor failures.  Honestly, I don't know how we did it.  But we survived.<p>Failure is far more honest than success.  Failure stories are a chance to pass down wisdom, to warn others of your plight, and to prevent them from taking the same steps into darkness.<p>Failure is also necessary.  Starting a company at a young age is  amateurish to some degree.. you can make up for a lot with energy and determination.  And if your lucky, ever so lucky, you won't make the one failure that puts you out of business.<p>The failures that don't put you out of business are your only chance at true reflection.  You've been slapped in the face, and hopefully it's obvious why.  The more issues you encounter early on, the stronger you + your company will be.  So savor every failure.  It makes you unique, and over time indestructible.<p>""Now you know.  Life is crummy, well now you know.<p>O.K.

8116610,comment,8113590,8115585,1,0,snowwrestler,,,"Overall I&#x27;ve been a happy Rackspace customer for years, but we&#x27;ve had the same experience with Apache troubleshooting. The support ended at whether Apache was up and running. Beyond that we were told Rackspace considered it to be &quot;application tuning&quot;--which covers all the important settings that are used to manage loads and secure Apache. Luckily a development company we had on contract had a great Linux admin who could help us out.<p>From this perspective Rackspace definitely has <i>not</i> performed a devops role for us. Network administrator? System administrator? Yes, absolutely, and great support for both. But devops is where the application meets the server, and IME Rackspace has stayed away from that.<p>I do see the reason for it--what does Rackspace know about our application? It&#x27;s not fair to hold them responsible for that. But it created a gap in our professional support.<p>edit: words",1406836742

This is completely undesirable, and doesn&#x27;t happen anyway because you like to a specific version which does <i>not</i> change from under you.<p>The arguments in favor of hosting it on a CDN like googles are:<p>1) Clients who visit other sites will precache the file, so there is a chance they wont even need to load jQuery at all, and this can increase perf<p>2) Pushing some files to different domains can decrease load times because browsers can load files from multiple domains in parallel instead of serially like they would from one domain.<p>3) For smaller sites the google CDN is likely actually more dependable than your own.

The current motto of the p6 faithful has become &quot;It&#x27;s a sister language not intended to replace Perl&quot; over the years, but a lot of things have changed over the years. If and when a usable p6 is released, who knows what the motto will be then?<p>You brushed over the Python 2 to 3 migration, but at least that one had a coherent strategy. It&#x27;s not an easy strategy, but there&#x27;s an end of support date for Python 2. There&#x27;s a widespread effort to port libraries and frameworks and projects to Python 3.<p>That hasn&#x27;t happened yet for Perl. It&#x27;s not clear if that&#x27;s ever going to happen for Perl. No one is exactly sure how much of the CPAN p6 will support, if any.<p>Will people start writing more new code in p6 instead of Perl? Will people port code from one to the other? Will p6 be able to use existing libraries? Will those libraries be usable in the same process?<p>When will p6 be stable? When will it have documentation? When will it have support, from a community point of view or a vendor or bundling in a supported distribution? When will it have tool support? What is its deprecation policy? What is its support period? Who will use it? What will they use it for? How much training do they need? How much do they charge? How easy is it to hire them?<p>There are so many unknowns. It&#x27;s unfair to sweep them under the rug and say &quot;Everyone should know that Perl is Perl and 6 is something else and the latter doesn&#x27;t matter.&quot;",1406836718

The biggest point about cryptocurrencies is that they are not centralized. In that sense Stellar seems a lot worse than regular currency. With a regular currency, at least the respective Central Bank or other monetary regulatory authority has credibility and accountability in the sense that they are indirectly elected by citizens as they are selected by the elected government. As such they have to have a history of integrity and monetary experience, and can be removed if they act unethically.<p>Stellar&#x27;s board, on the other hand, is self-elected, and with all due respect, don&#x27;t need to have the level of accountability or have the credibility of running such an organization, which even if it owns &quot;just 5%&quot; (+2% of Stripe&#x27;s) of the currency can potentially have substantial control over it.

Fines should be used as punishment, not deterrence (punishment is a form of deterrence, but is merely a side effect). If I decide to litter, it&#x27;s because I think &quot;this is not that big of a crime. I&#x27;m not harming people very much.&quot; It&#x27;s not anyones natural moral instinct to think, &quot;I would do this, but the penalty is to high&quot; - we&#x27;re conditioned to think that. But as is all to often, a lot of times people are not even <i>aware</i> that their actions may be illegal, or may not be aware the consequences are vastly harsher than the crime. Do you know what the penalty is for driving with one bad headlight? me neither. I <i>hope</i> its reasonable, especially when I make the decision to do it, but I base the decision off the fact that driving without a headlight does not seem that egregious of a crime.<p>So shouldn&#x27;t our punishment system be base off the same thing that people use to guide their decisions? The results of our actions?<p>The answer is yes. I don&#x27;t want to live in the world you are imagining. Even if there is no litter on the ground and no one speeds.<p>If you say, just inform everyone of the laws really really well so they know beforehand when making a decision, that is <i>utterly</i> impossible. Foreigners exist. People are busy. All laws are not even totally known to the lawmakers. It is an impossible task.<p>Back to your point: If the goal was to stop speeding, they would make it physically impossible to speed. Either by really pervasive robotic enforcement, or governors in cars. But they don&#x27;t do that, they want the money.<p>Still, the punishment should reflect the crime, even in the robotic police world.",1406835662

Google has started offering domain names [1] in beta, but with my experience with their support I don&#x27;t plan on using it.<p>Pricing is a big part of domains for me and AWS pricing seems a bit high to me. I&#x27;m also not sure on if whois privacy is offered or included? If it was then the domain price would be fine. I noticed a Route53 zone is included, but is it included in the price or costs additional? I had a domain with low traffic and it was $6/year just for DNS hosted zone so if it was included in the domain price I would probably move all of my domains, though whois privacy is still a big concern.<p>For the past few years I&#x27;ve been moving to Hover ($15) and then lately Badger ($10) as it is cheaper, but they both have whois privacy bundled in with the domain price as I think it is an important service. I previously worked on and maintained a domain registrar so these hit pretty close to home, but I&#x27;m still not really happy with any solution. It seems Amazon&#x27;s model of getting pricing lower didn&#x27;t really come through with this new offering just comparing to the current market.<p>Could hosted email be the next big thing AWS introduces?

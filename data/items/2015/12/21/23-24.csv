I would have happily moved back to Nottingham to live and work, but there were just no jobs in my field. I finished uni with a 1st with Hons. and had some good background (jobs, published parts of some small books etc.) After months of searching, I got only one or two offers in Nottingham and one was for £16k. It wasn&#x27;t until I expanded my search to the south that I finally started getting better offers and accepted one of £26k + bonus.<p>Truth is, I was simply open to moving anywhere (like most grads), that means you just send out a load of CVs and see where comes back to you. Because a majority of big businesses are based in the South, there are more large companies that will make you good offers. In the north there&#x27;s nowhere near as many businesses, so the likelihood of getting a good offer is slim when you&#x27;re applying to the south as well.<p>Something annoying is that the higher salaries are usually where higher priced rent/houses are, obviously because the salary will reflect the price of living in that area. In my mind, this means it can only ever get worse: the price of living keeps increasing which means salaries will keep having to rise to match, which means more grads flock to the area making it pricier and decreasing the price (or giving a lower increase rate) to the North as it becomes less desirable.<p>Maybe eventually we&#x27;ll all just live in the south and the north can finally just be for farming.",1450742214

10774523,comment,10770671,10770673,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"So, has it helped you &quot;tune&quot; your ear? i.e., are you able to correct your pitch without the tool now that you&#x27;ve spent time practicing with it? I&#x27;ve often wondered about that. I learned guitar at such a young age, that I don&#x27;t have a good recollection of the process of learning to have a reasonably good ear, or if it was something I already had and had to just learn to listen to.<p>As an adult, I&#x27;ve often gone years without seriously practicing music, and yet the basic ability to hear notes and tune instruments remains strong, no matter what. The ability to name notes and recognize chords on demand (so-called &quot;relative pitch&quot;) does require me to refresh my memory with practice whenever I take a long break from music, but recognizing when things are sharp or flat, and by how much, seems to be permanent and require no practice no matter how long it&#x27;s been. So, I theorize (and have read about science on the subject) that there may be a variety of parts of the mind that handle these subjects. But, I don&#x27;t recall reading if they&#x27;re all in-born skills or are acquired. Perfect pitch may be teachable to the very young...but not adults, so maybe my tuning ability simply developed and &quot;stuck&quot; because I was young. I dunno.",1450742133

Modern frameworks are moving away from two-way data binding (React, Angular 2.0, Ember, etc.)<p>Angular still has ngModel according to its docs. Whether you have two-way binding or not, View Models are still useful. Cycle.js doesn&#x27;t have two-way binding but uses Event Streams and has a pattern that is similar to MVVM (they call it Model-View-Intent but the Model is a View Model by normal definition).<p>React not having something like MVVM makes it difficult to create reusable components. Most React apps are divided into the view layer (which are &quot;components&quot; but really just dumb views) and application logic which lives in the flux layer. This division means you can&#x27;t / shouldn&#x27;t write components that fetch their own data.",1450741854

I suspect this is a temporary, happy circumstance that we enjoy today, due to the segment of history we inhabit, but am concerned it will be reversed due to physics, further market segmentation, and an ongoing miniaturization mania.<p>As semiconductor fabrication processes get smaller, die sizes larger, and operating frequencies higher, I think we will see the hardware become more opaque. Already the test equipment to hack on cutting edge workstation- and server-class processors is spendy; just a 2GHz 10GS/s oscilloscope is 5 figures USD $ even used and just-calibrated. As manufacturers head towards greater integration on the die to differentiate themselves in a furiously- and constantly-commoditizing industry, we&#x27;ll likely see more binary blobs at first, then market segmentation hits those of us who want open/powerful gear with a double-whammy. We enjoy the fruits of commodified hardware components now, but I&#x27;m not sanguine that state of affairs will last indefinitely due to the aforementioned integration trends.<p>As everyone noticed that personalized gear enjoys outsized margins, we&#x27;re seeing ever-increased pressure to further integrate and miniaturize into smaller packaging; repairability and accessibility to the hardware not invited at all to the design party. I really wish this specific trend would reverse.<p>I suspect that the PC as we know it will morph into a greater walled-garden device in the next several decades, and if we want open/powerful gear we will find ourselves in a tiny market segment.

Most science-related things at human scale can be done with your own two hands; you don&#x27;t require billion-dollar tools to fiddle with materials science, for example. Youtube is filled with videos of people doing human-scale science.<p>The whole &#x27;science requires faith&#x27; argument is largely thrown out to give credence to religion. The problem with that argument is that the fundamental building blocks of science <i>do not require faith</i>, and you build from those. The SI units are convention - you can make your own. What constitutes validity is convention - you can decide your own way. You don&#x27;t <i>require</i> faith to start doing basic science.<p>On the other hand, religion&#x27;s  basic building blocks <i>require</i> faith from the outset. Person X is divine, &#x27;trust us&#x27;. God Y likes or doesn&#x27;t like that, &#x27;trust us&#x27;. And from these basic religious building blocks, whole edifices are built. For example, most catholics are unaware of how the bible was pieced together by committee. That information doesn&#x27;t affect their day-to-day lives, however the religious rules that do affect them are based on those fundamental building blocks that are unverifiable by anyone. Faith is required because the foundational blocks are not verifiable <i>at all</i>.<p>This does not happen in science - you can verify the foundational rules yourself, and build as far along the tree as your interest and tooling allow. Theoretical physics existing in the &#x27;faith&#x27; world is largely a canard - most science is not like this, and theoretical physics is at the exploratory edge of science, not at the core foundational blocks. In short, the Planck Length is defined by the meter which we can see and confirm; the meter is not defined by the Planck Length which we theorise about.<p>Not to mention that in general, &#x27;scientific facts&#x27; are constantly tested, and &#x27;religious facts&#x27; are not. The engineering capabilities of steel are in constant use in almost every part of our lives; if science was wrong about them, the material would fail in unexpected ways. The divinity of the christ figure... well, it isn&#x27;t even testable. Christ is only divine to christians, but a steel bridge needs to hold up regardless of the mental state of the humans using it.",1450740625

There are some codebases that have come to rely on these behaviors so clang&#x27;s warnings can help make sure you don&#x27;t end up tied to one specific compiler.<p>- Personally, I like AddressSanitizer (ASan). It does similar checks as Valgrind, but using compile-time instrumentation -- just pass in an additional flag. Gets rid of a dependency.",1450740446

This is safer for pedestrians, especially for younger or older ones, because they only have to concentrate on one direction of traffic at a time.  This is what is meant by two-phase. Cross the first half, pause if you need to, then cross the second half.  On multi-lane crossings pedestrian beacons or signals are often added if the auto (or pedestrian) traffic is too numerous.  The signals can also be two phase, requiring the pedestrian to push a second button when they get to the median.  The median can also have a Z path to reorient the pedestrian to view oncoming traffic.  Also, the signals usually rest in off, so they are only activated if a pedestrian needs the help crossing.

The building across the street had a downstairs area that used to be another deli/coffee shop, but at one point but when rents went up, the owner couldn&#x27;t afford rent and closed, but it had been sitting vacant for around 3+ years by the time I worked there.<p>The roads in the office park had relatively narrow lanes with wide 20 foot green medians - I suppose the green grass in the medians looked nice, but the narrow lanes meant that bike riding was pretty dicey, there was not really enough room for cars to pass cyclists, and the 40mph speed limit meant that cars traveled at 45 - 50mph, making biking much more dangerous than it needed to be.<p>They had a shuttle to the nearest train station, but it ran on a fixed schedule that didn&#x27;t even try to sync up with the train schedule, which led to 20 - 40 minute delays while waiting for the shuttle on the way to work or waiting for the train home.

When a company sells space in their &quot;cloud&quot;, like maybe Microsoft or Amazon, there is a business guarantee that goes along with it. If Amazon were to randomly lose a big chuck of Netflix data, AWS&#x27;s business would tank immediately. AWS is a giant system that uses its scale and number of customers to efficiently provide a more stable system at a lower cost than all of those individual customers could achieve by building and maintaining their own IT.<p>I think it is sort of like a delivery system. If USPS or FedEx or USP started losing a massive number of packages (I know that they do lose some) then they would get abandoned, just like &quot;Cloud&quot; companies have an incentive to maintain a baseline level of quality. The alternative is that every business would have to create their own shipping services. I think it makes sense to assume that in most cases, unless the business is already massive enough to warrant it, that it is cheaper and more reliable to use the aggregate, dedicated ones for hire. The &quot;Cloud&quot; will be cheaper than individual implementations, and it won&#x27;t be nearly as suspect to individual implementation errors because the identical system will have been proven by many other customers (otherwise it would be abandoned).",1450739497

You get to pick zero or more of these ways. One of them is &quot;buy a bunch of iron and make a pile of it in your bedroom&quot;. Major risk factors here are your house burning down, you getting evicted, or there being a power cut. Another is &quot;rent those services from an infrastructure provider&quot;. Risk factors here are much harder for you to visualise, but include things like &quot;governments ban that company from operating in your country&quot;.<p>You can look at the risk of any of these options, and quantify it with an SLO, like &quot;we intend for this compute resource to be available 99.99% of the time in a given quarter&quot;. You can then have an SLA that defines what will happen if that objective is not met, and measure how often this is complied with over time. There are lots of ways to analyse this information, but let&#x27;s suppose that you can reduce it to a single number measuring how safe the resource is for your use case.<p>If you only look at a single option, and say &quot;this has a safety of X&quot;, then the only thing you can get out of this effort is anxiety. This only becomes interesting when you start looking at differences between alternatives, like &quot;the safety of servers in my bedroom is X, but the safety of buying resources on GCE is Y, so I can get this much of an improvement by spending that amount of money&quot;, or &quot;by doing both of these things I improve my safety to Z, and I am willing to pay the additional cost of doing so&quot;. Or perhaps your position would be &quot;this option is less safe but much cheaper and I&#x27;m willing to accept the extra risk&quot;.<p>The problem I have with the &quot;fuck the cloud&quot; article is that it doesn&#x27;t do any of this. All it says is &quot;the safety of this option is only X, you should experience anxiety&quot;. Is X higher or lower than that pile of iron in your bedroom?

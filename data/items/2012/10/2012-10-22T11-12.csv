I go nuts when people draw in Scandanavian examples for diverse anglo nations.<p>But that doesn't mean that the alternative of universal health as it's practiced in those other countries is a good alternative, just the obvious one.<p>The current US system is stupid: tying your healthcare to employment. It's no surprise that creating distance from the people who pay and the people who consume significantly increases costs.<p>In Australia you can opt for private health insurance, and get a rebate. Nothing like that in the UK. People in London who can afford it often pay for private service to avoid dealing with the state facilities. I'd be interested to know whether that was factored into the books for the figures you cite - I'd expect not.<p>The big issue is aged care. If the official system is so awful that you find ways to keep your parents at home longer - how does that get reflected in the numbers. Also quality of life issues - whether people in state aged care in country A are having a good time at greater expense, whereas those in country B are being dosed up with drugs to keep them quiet. What choice does the person and relatives have in that care? With universality - very little.<p>I can't see how universal care could deliver good outcomes for aged care. It has all the makings of a numbers game, an exercise in muddying the waters about who is responsible so they can ship a cheap one-size-fits-all model.",1350907154

Except he pads the numbers by assuming they'd have hit their 150 Million sales targets and sold another 50 million devices at an average of $200 (unsubsidized) and got 33% or $66 dollars profit from each one (neatly equalling the subsidy of $68 they get from Microsoft from each WinPhone they sell at current sales rates).<p>Of course, the Microsoft payments continue and were guaranteed, whereas Symbian was a gamble and is, frankly, now dead so the ""price"" of this choice becomes less with every passing day and depending on which numbers you pick out of the air, they could already be ahead on the deal.",1350906569

DRM is simply a technical method of enforcing a legal license.<p>Just because you <i>can</i> use a DRM free file in more ways (for example copy and share it) doesn't mean that the license grants you the rights to do so.<p>One example I remember from the early 90s was ""shareware"" where you could send off for a free or low cost copy of a software program. These programs were sometimes just demo versions but often actually provided the entire program for free.<p>However the license stated that you must either delete the program from your computer after some period (usually 30 days) or you must pay a ""registration fee"" to the developer. Of course without DRM they had no actual way of enforcing this so plenty of people kept shareware versions of programs long after the 30 days which lead to developers releasing only versions with limited functionality for free.",1350906251

Being also a HN reader, I'm very aware of what these companies can do, how accounts are closed without notice, wiping all your previous purchases, etc. So obviously as my spending went up in that one digital store, I became concerned of what could happen, especially reading their FAQ that clearly state all my money gave me nothing other than a right to access their online system. So I did like any good geek and I poked around, used a few web developer tools, and found a way to save those comics to PDF, for backup purposes. Now, whenever I buy a new title, the first thing I do is save it as PDF, before even reading it. So now I'm no longer worried about what this company might do, and I encourage everyone who buys goods digitally to do the same.

4682644,comment,4679756,4680378,2,0,emn13,,,"Even though it's almost certainly possible and even practically achievable to compress the required data into the 1MB of space, doing so without using more than 1MB even in temporaries might be impossible. (To get this close to the bound you'll need to use ""excess"" entropy from one bitpattern to save space in the next; i.e. a delta # doesn't straightforwardly correspond to a bit pattern, but instead depends on context.)  Clearly it would be hard, as you say.<p>An argument that you need context info: if you <i>don't</i> use context info, each bit pattern needs to be rounded <i>up</i> to the nearest number of whole bits.  That waste's about N/2 bits.  According to my calculations, that would raise the bound from 0.96MiB to 1.02MiB, i.e. too much.<p>But really, it's even worse.  Let's assume you can indeed define such a compression and you manage to use the context sufficiently to avoid wasting too many bits.  Further, you manage to do so without using much temporary space at all.<p>That means you'll need to be updating your sorted list in place.  Each update is likely to be a non-trivial task, since you need to find the place to update (with variable-width encoding and no space for luxuries like an index, that's probably a linear scan), and you need to take into account some amount of context - and then, because you've changed some data, recode possibly unbounded amounts (so N) of following context.  That makes this sorting algorithm quadratic; and it'll have a high scaling factor too since the operations we're counting here aren't cheap: we're not moving bits around, we're decoding and recoding them all the time in a context-sensitive way and that means doing lots and lots of branches.<p>Assuming the 1MB limit is reasonably inspired because the chip neads to be tiny, you're probably not dealing with the fastest chip in the world.  As an estimate, I'd guess this algorithm (if we could make it) would be about 1000000 times slower than a normal sort (assuming a 13 times higher constant factor), and you'd be running it on something very very slow.  On a modern processor, a plain sort takes about 75ms, making this thing 75 ks, or approximately 1 day.  On that very limited 1MB proc...<p>So even you manage to pull it off (very hard), it's almost certainly going to be very slow.",1350905148

MBTI indicates bimodal distributions of the attributes (people are either introverts or extroverts), when they are more like a normal distribution.<p>Gardner also lacks any real credibility, unless you throw out everything except ""different people can be good at different things"". It's good to encourage students to study a range of stuff (art, music and interpersonal stuff, not just math and english), but that's not really what Gardner is about. Students who are good at music aren't likely to learn math better if you sing it (OK, maybe I'm exaggerating).<p>Individualization isn't a great method. It's hard to do, and has a fairly small impact on student outcomes. Most students work best if you show them a diagram, explain everything, give them a chance to try it themselves, and demonstrate things in a number of ways. It's not about ""different strokes for different folks""; most students like a bit of variety.<p>The reason many students struggle is because they lack the right foundations. They didn't learn it last year (for whatever reason) so they struggle this year and can't catch up. This is much more common than students simply not having the right talents.<p>I'm not from the US, but Australia. From what I can tell, the US varies from state to state. The problems with the US aren't really related to pedagogy, but social issues (large black / hispanic communities going to black / hispanic schools, where everyone is trapped in the poverty cycle) and the way their standardized testing dominates everything.

Learning how to say something is easy, learning what to say, is hard. Each language has it's features, use case, pros and cons. But when you know what you want to achieve, learning a new language is something relatively easy. If you choose to learn something and stick with it you will only find the jobs for that. If you learn how to think, a language will no longer be a problem.<p>This is not an easy thing to do considering you are a beginner. But I strongly suggest you to go for it. Lear something from python or c# or php and then mix it. PHP is good because you can then mix it with html javascript & css to create a complete set of web skills. C# might be good to learn about classes types and other things. Each language has it perks. Learn a mindset and you will unlock them all.<p>I also suggest you to spend more time coding than reading books. Avoid videos, huge waste of time.

It&#x27;s not that the entire US government is conspiring against us. It&#x27;s more that each agency has evolved ideologies and practises that, when taken as a whole, form an oppressive machine. No-one designed that machine, and no-one group controls it. It simply is a function of the increased cooperation of individual agencies who each have their own set of norms and values that fail to align with the true interests of the populous. The US government is becoming more monolithic because of a systemic problem - that is, increased incentives for agencies to cooperate and share information.<p>- It also requires almost everyone to be amoral sociopaths, perfectly willing to go along with even the darkest and most depraved violations of civil liberties.<p>This argument assumes that the people who work in the US government have the same social norms and values as the rest of the population. It seems more likely to me that each agency forms its own little closed society, that has drifted away from mainstream society due to the unique freedoms and pressures that agency experiences. The &quot;Blue Code of Silence&quot; is an example of this within the police. Few people are amoral sociopaths, but the vast majority of people will accept the values and norms of their peers without question.",1375966799

There are shunts of existing files and directories, interactive prompts, EULAs to agree to (try installing mscorefonts on Ubuntu), packages that immediately start services that generate files on first run that the service expects to be there from then on, packages that expect other packages to <i>not</i> have been installed (samba3 doesn&#x27;t like samba4 much)--and so forth. Installing a package <i>can fail</i>, or produce widely-varying results from machine to machine.<p>&quot;Configuration management&quot;, ala Chef/Puppet, is no better--it tries to manipulate a system from an <i>unknown</i> state into a <i>known</i> state, without having an awareness of the full set of interactions that the <i>unknown</i> state can have on the <i>known</i> state. (For example, deploy Apache with default setup via Chef, on a server that already had Nginx installed manually. What do you get? Who knows!)<p>You&#x27;d think that, say, running the OS install media from scratch on each &quot;container-up&quot;, and then running a script to install a preset list of packages with hardcoded versions, might be enough--but nope, OS install media is absolutely non-deterministic, just like everything else. The installer could decide from the container&#x27;s IP address that it should talk to a different package server (oh hey I&#x27;m in Canada let&#x27;s use ca.archive.ubuntu.com!) and then find itself unable to get past the deploy-infrastructure&#x27;s firewall-whitelist.<p>In short--anything that relies upon, or can make a decision based upon, information that could be different from container to container (like the container&#x27;s IP address, for example) <i>isn&#x27;t guaranteed</i> to produce binary-identical results at the target. You <i>only</i> get that by running through whatever imperative process spits out all these files <i>once</i>--and then freezing the results into a <i>declarative</i> container.<p>So, what does work? Xen snapshots. Amazon AMIs. Vagrant images. All of these are declarative. And all of these <i>are target formats</i> for Docker. Docker is a vendor-neutral thing which you will <i>turn into these</i>, along with turning it into its current LXC+aufs form.<p>And note, by design, the running images of the &quot;final product&quot; will be leaf-nodes; you won&#x27;t touch them or modify them or SSH into them, you won&#x27;t base new containers on them; you&#x27;ll just spin them up and then down again, like on-demand EC2 instances. Docker is not <i>for</i> doing fancy things with the running final products in their target format. Docker, by itself, is <i>not for production at all!</i> Once you&#x27;ve deployed a Docker container as a Xen snapshot or an AMI or whatever, it&#x27;s done; some other infrastructure takes care of the <i>running the target-format containers</i> part.<p>So what&#x27;s all that junk in the Docker toolchain? Docker, as a standard, is an <i>intermediary format</i> that makes it easy for <i>developers</i> to build these vendor-neutral images. The reason you can start containers, stop them, freeze them, and then fork new containers from them, is entirely to do with <i>developing new container images</i>, and not at all to do with deploying containers in production.

Chrome also likes to remember incorrect passwords in these duplicate entries, thwarting attempts at usability on many of the AD-credentialed sites I visit. I have not tested this stuff with non-HTTP, non-AD authentication, but I would expect similar behavior. I&#x27;ve provided Google with details.<p>I&#x27;m a Mac developer for my company. I use a Mac running OS X. I use Chrome as my default browser. The company network has Windows servers and our network credentials are handled by Active Directory. For this test, I closed Chrome and deleted the passwords (there were three listed) and reopened Chrome.<p>I open TFS in a new tab, I&#x27;m prompted for my AD credentials. I enter them, log in successfully, and Chrome asks if I it should save this password for my. I answer &#x27;Yes.&#x27; I look back at the keychain and <i>bam</i> there are two entries.<p>When I changed my AD password on Monday, Chrome needed the new password. I enter it in the prompt, but Chrome changes the password in only one of these keychain entries. Deleting the incorrect password entry while Chrome is running did no good - it was recreated by Chrome <i>with the wrong password.</i> Then on subsequent starts, I don&#x27;t know which password Chrome is trying to use, I click &#x27;login&#x27; without typing a password[1] and it fails. So I continually have to type my password anyway, unless I visit the keychain and remove the offending password.<p>[1] The prompts for AD credentials annoy me; I&#x27;m presented with the login prompt every time I open this page; can&#x27;t the browser just submit the password and only prompt me if it fails?",1375965628

Statistically, at around 5 to 7 years post-graduation, your much lower tuition paying state school peers will end up at job parity with you. Unless your school offers some highly specific specialty program that you can&#x27;t get anywhere else.<p>I&#x27;ve written here quite a bit about my school experience and why it doesn&#x27;t have to put new grads into unbelievable debt. I did freshmen through MS for under $30k out of pocket -- in the U.S and not all that long ago. Looking at the subject the last few years I&#x27;ve no reason to think it can&#x27;t still be done for maybe no more than $45-50k. Paying off all of my student debt 3 years out of undergrad, then earning enough to cover my M.S. out of pocket is a pretty awesome feeling. (BTW My school&#x27;s entire endowment wouldn&#x27;t even add up to MIT&#x27;s yearly earned interest on their&#x27;s)<p>If you really think that your school is where you have to go, most outrageously expensive private schools have a handsome tuition assistance program if you can figure out how to work the system -- these days you can probably get an undergrad from one of those schools for less than I paid for my education. They probably do everything they can not to advertise is. But you have to have lots of chutzpah and don&#x27;t take no for an answer. Hit the tuition assistance office daily, be a squeaky wheel, adjust your living conditions to suite the requirements for maximum assistance. Need to make less than $x per year? Do that. Need to not be a dependent of your parents? Do that (make sure they take you off of their taxes, you might need a copy). Get extra assistance as a school employee? Get a crap job cleaning floors.<p>Do not pay the inflated sticker price just to have fashionable brand recognition for a brand that won&#x27;t matter in the job market in 7 years.<p>Do the math and optimize. If you aren&#x27;t willing to do that, it might be worth reevaluating why you went to an &quot;exceptionally expensive&quot; school in the first place.",1375964780

By splitting the OS from the runtime from the application, each one can be updated when the layer above it needs it to be, and is otherwise fixed to a binary-identical image. Then, new releases of higher-level things (apps) can target the <i>old</i> versions of lower-level things (runtimes, OSes), knowing they will be <i>literally</i>, bit-for-bit, the same thing their other releases are using.<p>This is the guarantee Heroku makes, for example: updates to their servers will never break your app, because although the packages making up their <i>infrastructure</i> might update, the packages making up <i>your container&#x27;s base image</i> are frozen in time unless <i>you</i> switch out your container&#x27;s &quot;stack&quot; (base image) for a new one.<p>Having a frozen base OS image, and then a frozen runtime on top of that, allows for perfect <i>repeatability</i> in your deploy process. Once you&#x27;ve got a tested-and-working runtime image, that references a tested-and-working OS image, you just stop touching them altogether; you keep the container-ID of that runtime image fixed in production, and deploy your new app releases on top of it.<p>One neat side-effect of this: if containers have parent-images in common, those parent-images can be <i>cached</i> at the target. If all the containers running on some server use the same common base-image, that base image only needs to be downloaded to the server once. The second-through-Nth time, the container only grabs what&#x27;s different--the tiny &quot;app&quot; part of the image--and then composes it with everything into a running container.",1375964401

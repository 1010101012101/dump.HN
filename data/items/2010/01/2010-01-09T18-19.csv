Rather, he suggests that the storage of fat be perceived as the primary driver, and caloric intake & expenditure taking a back seat.  He re-frames it this way because the real central thesis is about how fructose is a driver of obesity, which in turn leads to increased consumption.<p>The caloric in/out slide only serves as motivation  for why we should be wary of the fact that fructose is a chronic toxin (in particular, the effects thereof), and how HFCS is an economic evil as much as a metabolic one.<p>It's ok to rail against the headline, though.

There is also some evidence they convince your body it is living in feast/famine time which triggers a fat accumulation response. I do not believe that it is healthy to remove carbohydrates from your body. The body is a complex machine indeed, but we have a pretty good understanding of how it works regarding nutrition. Most structures run on glucose, muscles are made of protein, fiber helps digestion and micronutrients are used all over the place. The bottom line is that fat is used for storing extra glucose. The function of protein in nutrition is very interesting. If you don't get enough, then your body will cannibalize muscles to get it. Proteins can be broken down to provide glucose, but it's inefficient and generates toxins. Carbohydrates break down to glucose much better. I would suggest you try a conventional approach : Checkout nutritiondata.com or one of the numerous calculators and for your weight and height calculate your daily needs. Pay particular attention to the grams of fiber needed and setup a plan that leads to 1-2lbs of fat loss per week - a deficit of only 500-1000 calories per day. Changing habits faster than that is generally not practical, it certainly never was for me. Make sure you are getting enough protein without overwhelming calories, supplementing with a protein shake if necessary. Try that out for half a year or a year with daily measurements and diet recalculation every 10 lbs lost. Never, ever deviate from the selected diet (you accomplish this by leaving wiggle room in your estimates), weigh yourself daily and keep careful records. I really don't think carb free living is either sustainable or healthy.",1263062209

This problem is almost unsolvable in such a house, but the real annoyance is that there's <i>so many dishes</i> in the sink at all times.<p>At some point I solved this problem by removing all but 4 of each item, and locking them up.  That way you at least limit the dirty pile and force people to clean the dishes semi-frequently.  If you're having 7 people over for dinner (never happened), just ask me for the key :)",1263061748

So, something like dFat/dt = (f(calories in) - caloriesBurned())/3500 = amount of fat gained for some period of time. f might include something about the structure of the calories coming in, but it makes sense and my experience supports it.",1263061491

In other words, if you feel that the stress of having a child will be well worth it, then you'll tell yourself that over and over while you're stressed. It will become true to you and the perception and emotions of a stress event changes.<p>This kind of reverse thinking is how we grow. Touch a hot stove, burn yourself, and cry about it. Next time you won't want to touch the hot stove because it hurt last time. If you did a study of people who touched hot stoves just after the fact, I'm sure you'd find that touching a hot stove reduces happiness and increases stress levels. However if you wait long enough, this lesson of stoves==hot results in decades of NOT touching hot stoves and NOT getting burned by them. A study of that should reveal that by touching a hot stove once, you've gained a lifetime absence (aside from accidents) of the stress and unhappiness associated with touching a hot stove. Suddenly the one time you burned yourself seems to have been worth the pain.",1263061262

It's an investment. You buy a property, then a few years later can sell it for quite a bit more than you paid. As long as it's a property that is attractive people will always want it.<p>Personally I find the economics extremely clear cut. Mortgage payments here are comparable to rental payments, if not lower. So you can either give the money to a landlord and get nothing in return, or you can give it to a bank, pay off the balance (Long terms savings), and benefit when house prices increase if you sell it. Or of course just wait until mortgage is over and then live there rent free for the rest of your life.<p>I've never understood why the economics are even debated online like this :/",1263061088

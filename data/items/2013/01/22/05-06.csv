What it means is that you, as a non-doctor, should excercise some discretion and humility wen choosing your words. Expressing harsh condemnation and judgment when you have a small piece of the picture is an unbelievable asshole move. None of these Tough Guys throwing around words like ""crapware"" and ""spammer"" would ever call anyone out like this in public, I guarantee it -- it's all keyboard courage and nerdrage.<p><i>This seems to be largely because they appear as a company that has strong driving principles about the sort of changes they want to see in the world.</i><p>IMO it's more due to the fact that YC asks for nerds to come as they are -- the entry process asks you how you're a hacker, and if you're selected you get an interview where pg wants you to geek out with him about your product. No flashy pitches or navigating social networks to get the right intro -- it's a process that cuts out all the BS that doesn't appeal to nerds.<p>The idea that there is some violated goodwill is just backwards rationalization. And it doesn't change my point, which is, essentially: who are you to question where YC invests?",1358834229
5095782,comment,5095634,5095762,7,0,DigitalSea,,,"It doesn't need to paint the whole story. If the dude committed any overly serious crime, he'd still be in custody right now awaiting sentencing. They don't let you out on bail if you're a serious offender. I'm sure there is more than meets the eye here, but given the the spotlight being shined upon hacking cases like this of late, it's not hard to believe that what this guy says isn't what went down. Andrew was obviously a troll in every sense of the word, reckless and irresponsible but by no means did he have to bypass any security measures to get the email addresses. I would argue it's the equivalent of a bank leaving it's doors unlocked, alarm systems deactivated and lights on and someone walking in and taking money, then the bank complaining they got robbed, but this situation is blown way out of proportion and a metaphor like that would be over the top.<p>What he did is no different to someone writing a script that scours the web looking for email addresses (a tactic spammers have used and gotten away with for years), except no trickery was required to get the addresses AT&T were handing them over unknowingly without recourse. This can't even be considered a hack, more of an exploit if anything.<p>The stupidity of wanting to embarrass was no doubt a really stupid move to make, but definitely not some security defying hack. People shouldn't be jailed for acting like idiots, AT&T should be the ones being scalded for allowing this to happen in the first place. A company has a responsibility to keep customer data safe, AT&T should be no exception to that rule.",1358834193

5095774,comment,5095634,5095735,9,0,rayiner,,,"The problem is that there is little consensus on what the boundaries in digital space should mean. Law makers, not without a certain logic, approach things from the principles of private property. Is changing a public URL considered ""conspiracy to access a computer without authorization?"" Well why would you do it, intentionally? Would you jiggle my door handle to see if that would unlock it? And if it was a crappy lock and jiggling it did unlock it, would it be unauthorized access to my property if you then walked in the door?<p>There is a line of thinking in the tech community that accessing data you're not supposed to access is only ""bad"" if you do something ""bad"" with it. But in meat space, we enforce fences in their own right, whether or not there is any other criminal activity involved. Arguably, doing so makes the larger problem of ensuring that their <i>isn't</i> associated criminal activity more tractable.<p>Actually, real world example: over the weekend someone stole my phone out of my (unlocked) car while it was parked in my apartment building's garage. Now, let's say he hadn't stolen the phone. Just rifled through the glove box and center console. No harm no foul, right? Of course not. We presume there is no good reason to be looking through someone else's car, even if you fully intend not to take anything.<p>Now, that doesn't mean we should treat digital boundaries the same as physical ones, but I don't think it's as obvious as some people in the tech community make it out to be that there shouldn't be penalties (of some sort--the magnitude of such penalties is a whole another debate) for intentionally violating digital boundaries, regardless of how well they are protected.",1358834044

I believe your article used the word manipulative to describe the use of age in the title.  The irony was most likely lost on you.<p>I could critique the word choice by saying that using that word suggests that the author is being dishonest and deceitful.  Manipulative, while technically correct in the abstract, is not necessarily accurate when one considers that the intent might merely to have been to provide context.  At the same time using the word manipulative brings along baggage you might not intend.  Manipulative implies intent on the part of the person doing the manipulation.<p>I could also critique your use of the word in another way (and,as it so happens, the way you used it).  Keep in mind, this is still technically correct.<p>Your use of the word manipulative is deceitful.  Your use of the word suggests you know intent, and your use of the word attempts to do what you accuse the the original posters of doing: attempting to manipulate the reader by framing the argument as one against deceitful, manipulative, and by extension, distrustful young people.  Words are powerful, and your word choice demonstrates that, at the very least, you either have no clue, or your a vile, deceitful individual.<p>Both methods of critique are valid.  One addresses the problem, the other addresses the person.  Both are unbiased and fair criticisms, but only one is polite.<p>We, as a community should strive to encourage.  This is not any where close to blanket approval or being yes men.  But do NOT for a minute think that good, helpful criticism is simply unbiased and fair. It is not.",1358832580

Free is free.<p>If on the other hand even with the paid extra web dyno you were still getting ~10 second spin up times after idle, that  would be something I'd get annoyed at too.<p>If you're willing to pay over $100/month on services you may or may not need just for the learning experience -- perhaps scale some of those back, and instead pay $35/month for the web dyno you do actually need to avoid the idle spin up time.<p>I do think it's true that heroku can end up being a lot more expensive than you initially expect for what you need, the extras can add up quick.

Then they enter college and meet people who are more intelligent or proficient and can't seem to accept the reality of the situation.<p>As an example, there was one section of organic chemistry for freshmen, and to get into that class you had to have a 5 in AP chem and pass two exams. I saw many of my classmates (Columbia) who were genuinely taken aback that they weren't the top of the freshman class -- and many of these self-styled rock stars never heard of the IChO!<p>It is better for long term growth if kids are humbled at an earlier age than to be shocked much later in life.

So if it were ""just another"" graph database and nothing more, I'd agree with you.<p>However, Datomic puts together a whole host of other concepts - data immutability and all its resulting benefits; separation of query, storage, write, coordination (with carefully considered trade-offs); Datalog-based querying in place of SQL; in-app access to data with a great solution for the string concatenation hell that we've all gone through trying to juggle our SQL, and the list goes on.<p>I don't think any of these individually make Datomic special, but collectively?

5095630,comment,5095239,5095461,8,0,rdtsc,,,"> I find the American approach to the elderly a bit bizarre.<p>It is messed up and you are right it is cultural and also financial. Here are a few reasons I can think of:<p>* The sense of independence and individualism, be self sufficient, don't depend on other, keep to your own business.<p>* The health care system is messed up. Having health care tied to the workplace is all kinds of fucked up. Not being able to add parents as regular ""dependents"" to the health care plans is also messed up. I would expect these from a developing country not from US.<p>* Increased mobility. Jobs become more transient and families are moving more, sometimes across country. Now the elderly parents have a hard choice, stay in a place they know and have friends or follow the family of the child (who now has to support and provide for a large extended family).<p>* Living quality expectations. The idea that ""if you make this much salary, you fit in this social group and are expected to have this standard of living"".  Like say someone making $50K taking care of 4 elderly people and 2 kids might have to scale down on the food they eat, vacations they take, type of cars they can buy, parts of town they can afford to live.",1358830998

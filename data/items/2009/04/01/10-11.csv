541653,comment,539276,539884,0,0,riobard,,,"I'm native Chinese. I speak English quite well, and now I'm learning German. I definitely agree with you that German is much much easier to learn if one knows another Latin-based language before. I guess same is true for French or Spanish--They are just way too similar. And they share a lot of cultural background so differences seem very trivial compared to the painful transition from Chinese to English.",1238583361

Digging around online, I came across this interesting article by Steven Covey (author of 7 Habits of Highly Effective People) and posses some really interesting questions that I think can help people start towards refining their voice.

I started with using mouse/touchpad with my left hand, but when it comes to writing with a pen or using chopsticks, my left hand always makes me feel dumb ... I guess more practice is needed. Gonna try that in the next month. Thanks! :)",1238582837
541643,comment,540540,540659,0,0,RWilson,,,"You're technically right.  For reference, look and feel fall under ""trade dress"" [<a href=""http://www.ivanhoffman.com/tradedress.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ivanhoffman.com/tradedress.html</a>].  In brief, the relevant case law is:<p>""To recover for trade dress infringement ... a plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) that its trade dress has obtained “secondary meaning” in the marketplace; (2) that the trade dress of the two competing products is confusingly similar; and (3) that the appropriated features of the trade dress are primarily nonfunctional.""<p>Continuing ...<p>""Strength of ... trade dress depends upon the interplay of two elements, the uniqueness of the trade dress and the investment in imbuing a trade dress with secondary meaning.""<p>... which makes trade dress difficult to prove, even to only a preponderance of the evidence.",1238582587

And you pick a hosted option, where the way things are done (moderated, organised) are out of your control.<p>What I can't understand is that if a customer wants support or is complaining, they are already a customer, why would you want them to go to a different place to voice their opinion? Does it matter than Joe uses Basecamp and uses Twitter.<p>How does that make the support task for Twitter simpler?<p>Isn't this just a Yahoo Answers like service which is split by company? But charges the company $100/month to participate.<p>I'm wondering if I should start one, there seems to be a lot of money in it. 14000 * .8 * $100 = $1,120,000 per month.

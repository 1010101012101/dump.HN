That part of the article was explaining that longer and more complicated is not necessarily better in terms of readability, and there is a sweet spot where something is concise but not overabbreviated. That's all obviously true. Then he suggested that ""maxphysaddr"" is in this sweet spot for the idea of the highest point in physical memory that can be addressed, which I think is wrong.",1289339966
1888111,comment,1886492,1887886,0,0,MrFoof,,,"I wasn't looking at it from a co-op or car sharing perspective.  I was looking at it from a ""how can a car cost $1000 a month perspective"".  The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution and Subaru WRX STis are probably the best known examples of post-purchase sticker shock considering a transaction cost that is only 110-115% of that of the ""average new car transaction cost"".  Especially the Mitsubishi, which was referred to by Jeremy Clarkson as ""needs to be serviced every 300 yards"".<p>The Yokohama Advan A046s had a 140 treadwear rating.  High-output turbocharged engines (140HP/liter bone stock) tend to require frequent oil changes.  High-output turbocharged engines also tend to run rich, basically using unspent fuel to help cool the turbo -- 14mpg is seriously what was observed under mostly rush-hour highway traffic.  Premium fuel was required since it still had a near 12:1 compression ratio.<p>Those cars would <i>never</i> be offered via co-op, and I can't think of a car sharing service that even offers genuine bona-fide sports cars.  They are rare, not mass market.  They're incredibly noisy.  Not very comfortable.  They're ""compacts"" (in the US).  They're only offered with manual transmissions (until recently).  They'd be absolutely catastrophic loss leaders, especially with hooligans beating the piss out of them.  They were engineered to be the most entertaining cars for the lowest transaction cost possible... but they very quickly compensate for their low sticker price with maintenance bills from a 911.<p>-----<p>What about those who purchase, say, a new Toyota V6 Camry, load it up to $30K, then put the minimum they'll allow down?  Right there you're looking at a $550-$600/mo payment (and dealers won't care if they're getting paid and have the car off their floor plan).  Add $100-150/mo in insurance.  Assuming a 25mpg average, it's not hard to get right on the cusp of $1000/mo for the first 5 years, depending on how far people commute.  That's with a vehicle that's around the average transaction price for a new car in this country.<p>My point remains that it's not hard to hit $1000/mo.  I don't consider that prudent in the slightest, but a fair number of people experience just that.<p>As I said, I know how to not spend money on a car as well.  I bought a Mazda MX-5 cash.  Moved close enough to work to take mass transit.  Negotiated secure garaging in my lease.  Just use it as a toy.  Between insurance ($120/mo), maintenance and fuel, $200/mo would be exceptional.  I think I've spent $600 total on gasoline in the past 22 months, whereas 4 years ago, I remembered spending that <i>every month</i> on just fuel.",1289339955

Seems like a 15% premium is something people will consider paying if it only amounts to $30, but might not if it's $300.<p>This was especially true in the early days of the PC revolution.  The Mac 128K sold for $2495 at the time, which is more than $5000 in today's dollars[1].  I can't find any good stats on what a typical PC cost at the time, but let's say it was half that.  That's a HUGE difference; a mortgage payment (or more than one!) and not something many individuals or businesses are going to pay, even for substantially better quality.<p>Other factors:<p>* No amount of speed was enough.  People bought computers to, well, <i>compute</i> things, and there were real limits users experienced because of slow processors.  This is no longer true for most uses.  Faster speeds are nice to have, but it's no longer true that 20% faster number crunching is a huge win for many people.<p>* With such expensive kit, businesses were understandably reluctant to commit to any platform that didn't let them multiple-source parts and perform repairs.  Backups were expensive or non-existent.  By contrast, a defective mobile device is simply exchanged or written off.<p>* In 1984, worldwide PC shipments totaled 6.3M units.  Commodity parts were the only way to achieve any kind of economy of scale, not to mention the benefits of competition.  20 years later, it was 177M. [2]  At that level, even a minority player can get the same economy of scale that the entire PC industry enjoyed a decade earlier.<p>Anyway.  Nobody knows how this will all shake out.  But the spectacular success of the modular PC market doesn't mean it's the inevitable outcome.<p>[1] <a href=""http://bit.ly/9P293K"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/9P293K</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://bit.ly/a9XLJF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/a9XLJF</a>",1289338120

I doubt zipcar lets you take their cars to track days, even if they had a car you'd want to take. And at 26k miles/yr, I don't think a co-op would work either.<p>Rather than ""trivially"" making it to $1500/month, I think you pushed most parameters to the expensive side.<p>As a contrast, I have a 2001 Passat that I've owned for 6 years and do all the maintenance on myself.

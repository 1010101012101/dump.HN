2261880,comment,2258669,2258669,0,0,kevindewalt,,,"Guys,<p>This is really clever.  When I first looked at it I thought ""I can already do this in my app or with Unbounce or ...""<p>But then when I took a closer look at app it occurred to me that this is sooooo simple.  Unbounce takes a learning curve and doing app-level routing testing can take some configuration.<p>With that in mind, I see a couple of options:<p>1.  Do A/B testing on the type of products you suggest, such as Google Docs that don't normally then themselves to such functionality.  The issue I have with this approach is that I don't actually know of a situation where I would have done this.  The times I'm A/B testing something (which isn't often), I'm highly invested in whatever I'm doing and the outcome.  This is almost always whatever I'm building or selling, hence Unbounce or my own app.<p>2. Figure out a way to put var.to INTO an app or a situation that I care a lot about and would pay for the tool.  IF you could figure out way to make it drop-dead simple for me to put it into my app and then provided killer analytics an services on top if it, then it might be something I'd pay for.<p>Bottom line:  I think you have a clever, interesting, easy-to-use tool that I like from an intellectually curious position. But it doesn't yet grip me emotionally with a ""I've GOT to use this"" position yet.<p>Nice job, hope it helps!<p>Kevin",1298635144

We wanted to improve our time tracking and accelerate invoicing procedures. To find an appropriate solution, we screened all existing time tracking and invoicing products and found out that they were either easy to use, but too superficial for what we needed, or way too comprehensive and complex. So we started to create our own solution which was supposed to be „just right“ for our purposes.  Many of our business partners started to be interested in this solution  and we made it available for them. As the feedback was very positive, we made the decision to offer it as a software as a service and call it cronsync.<p>We have launched cronsync this year.

Anyone earning a typical software developer salary in London and renting somewhere <i>in town</i> at £2000 a month just for them is a fool. Most people live out in the suburbs and commute in or live with other people and split the costs. You can get a nice flat in somewhere like Croydon or Kingston (hardly bad places to live and only 30 minutes out on the train) for £800 a month - call it £1000/mo after council tax and utilities. Split that with the girlfriend/roommate and you're spending peanuts.<p>All that said, the point is that £60k/$100k isn't a <i>common</i> salary for this sort of full-time worker outside of management or in an early stage of their career (<10 years).

I would imagine if you already have a system, even if it is an old expensive legacy system, you would not switch simply because of an IPad enabled device.<p>Even if there are other benefits associated with it such as being SaaS-based and cheaper/more secure, the conversion rates I would think would be low when there already exists free cloud based solutions and open-source solutions which they haven't already converted to already.<p>Thus, this makes me think the target market would be the pen & paper crowd. I'm curious to see what the conversion rate is for this crowd since this seems like a tough crowd to convince.<p>Even in scenarios where the EMR/EHR system is completely free (either through pricing plans or government grants) you don't see many of them moving away from the pen & paper which signals price might not be the most important factor here either.<p>To me this leaves overall usability and learning curve which I'm not sure if DrChrono necessarily promotes as their pitch seems to be portability.<p>I'd like to see how their product matures to tackle that issue since in my opinion their competitors really aren't other EHR vendors as much as the huge pen & paper market that's a much larger share of the pie.",1298631718

Poker permits the most leverage for knowing hidden information, but in poker you scam the other players, not the casino (casinos very rarely offer poker games played against the house.)<p>Maybe it was Pai Gow Poker, which does have strategy that can be exploited by knowing the dealer hand you need to beat, and is often played for high stakes in VIP rooms.",1363456775

Mac can do the same thing with Mac OSX Server edition.<p>An entirely different question is, is it sensible?\nOur university has two computer clusters accessible by Computer Science students only, one with Windows and other with Linux - 200 computers each. Guess which one is giving more problems? And the reason is that Windows server is a much more refined product. I would say that it's slower,but it makes sure everything is correct, double checks if there is no corruption, if the connection is authenticated, if you are not over your quota, and then it does fantastic job of restoring the machines to ideal state every day and keeping them updated.<p>Linux does the same thing,but only partially. Profiles get corrupted frequently,because it just seems to write what comes from the network, and if it looses connection it takes a while before it realises that it happened. And after that, it proceeds as if nothing had happened, while Windows has procedures to repair user's profile. As a result, our admin is constantly fixing all the weird problems with Linux machines, while our Windows machines keep running most of the time without a fault.<p>I am not saying that it's not possible to run Linux domain systems - but they require(in my experience) a lot more maintenance than Windows systems.",1363456278

5386115,comment,5385523,5385523,3,0,graycat,,,"First, let's look at what is an 'algorithm':  The examples that got famous were the sorting and searching algorithms in Knuth's TACP.  So, people quickly coded up bubble sort which has running time proportional to n^2 for sorting n items, and in practice n^2 grew too darned fast.  So, people were eager for Shell sort, quick sort, heap sort, merge sort, etc. which all had running times proportional or nearly so to (n)log(n) in average case or even worst case.  Then there was radix sort which could beat (n)log(n).  So, people got excited about 'algorithms'.<p>So, what did we get?  We wanted to sort (or work with trees, etc.).  We knew how to do that manually.  We could write the code, but our first cut code tended to be too slow.  Heap sort, etc. are really clever.  Stare at the code (typically are doing an informal proof of correctness by mathematical induction based on the definition of the natural numbers) and can confirm that it sorts, and with analysis as in Knuth can confirm the running time, e.g., worst case (n)log(n).  So, net, there's not much question about what it does, that it actually sorts, and how fast it is.  Great -- for sorting and searching.<p>Do I ever do such things?  Actually, early in my project I wrote a bunch of heap sort routines, polymorphic, etc.  I wanted to write some 'stable' versions but didn't get around to it this time.  Also can write versions that sort by 'surrogate', that is, move only pointers and not the data.  For some of the details of how Microsoft's Visual Basic .NET works with strings and instances of objects, there is some question about the value of sorting by surrogate!  Then with the results, can have an O(n) routine that will take the 'permutation' of the pointers and move the data.  Etc.  I didn't write everything I could think of in sorting, but some of what I wrote is good and used in my code.  And I got some polymorphic code that is only 2-3 times slower than a non-polymorphic version.  So, yes, I did some work in algorithms, even some quite old ones.<p>Next I needed a 'priority queue' so borrowed the heap data structure from heap sort and, presto, got a nice priority queue routine.  It's in my production code.<p>So, yes, I worked in algorithms.  And for my project, that work is crucial in the sense that without it my software wouldn't work or, if I had used code I knew about from others, not work as well.<p>But now there is another issue in computing and software:  There are old examples; since they are more explicit, let's start with those.  For a positive integer n, suppose A is an n x n matrix of real numbers and we seek x, n x 1, to solve Ax = b where b is also real numbers and n x 1.<p>Now we need an 'algorithm'?  Not really!  An 'algorithm' as in sorting is not enough!  Instead we need some mathematics prior to any sense of an 'algorithm'!  Usually the mathematics we use is Gauss elimination, and a good chunk of a course in linear algebra makes clear just what that is doing and why it works.<p>Here's much of the difference:  Looking at a description of code for, say, heap sort, it's easy to see that it sorts.  Looking at a description of code for Gauss elimination, it's totally obscure why it solves Ax = b, that Ax = b has none, one, or infinitely many solutions, and if infinitely many how to characterize them.  Instead of just the code, just the 'algorithm' for Gauss elimination, we need the math from, say, linear algebra.  Similarly for a numerical solution to an initial value problem for an ordinary differential equation.<p>Then more generally, for some software, it may be that some math, new or old, is crucial for knowing what the software will do, much as the linear algebra was crucial for knowing what some Gauss elimination code will do.  E.g., in Gauss elimination, turns out have some choice about the 'pivot' elements.  Well, typically want to select the pivot that is largest in absolute value.  Why?  Some math!  Next, do a lot of 'inner product' arithmetic.  Then want to accumulate inner products in double precision.  Next, when get a solution, want to do a little more work with double precision and do some 'iterative improvement'.  And would like to know the 'condition number' to get some error bounds -- all in the code and all needing some math to know why it works.<p>So, net, for many good solutions to real problems, an 'algorithm' alone has not enough to recommend it and need some prior logical support from, say, some applied math.  So, in code, algorithms are not everything that is important; in such cases, an algorithm alone does not have enough to recommend it.<p>In my project, some original math was crucial, and got converted into code.  But to have any confidence in what the code will do, can't just stare at the code and, instead, need the math.  That is, just an algorithm was not enough.<p>So, in my project there has been work in both algorithms and applied math.  That work is crucial in that without it the project would flop or nearly so.<p>But, right, also is working through a lot of routine logic.  E.g., the code for yesterday was to be clear at the start of the code for a Web page just where the user came from.  There were three cases, the first two legal and the third a symptom of an attempt at hacking.  So, I needed to work out the logic.  For that I needed some answers to some of how Microsoft's ASP.NET worked.  E.g., if transfer to page B from page A via in page A code server.transfer(""B""), then in the code of page B, what is the value of Request.UrlReferrer?  Use the TIFO method -- try it and find out.  So, right, such 'logic' is routine but takes time.<p>Then where most of the time went!  Right, to none of the above!  Most of the time, likely over 80%, went, may I have the envelope, please?  Yes, here it is (drum roll):  The nominees for where most of the time went are\n(1) working through poorly written technical documentation, (2) software installation, (3) software configuration, (4) data backup and recovery, especially for the boot partition, (5) system security, e.g., fighting viruses, and (6) fighting bugs.  And the winner is, (1) working through poorly written technical documentation!  Heck, reading Knuth, Ullman, Sedgewick, etc. was fast, fun, and easy, but reading the documentation on the 'platform' was painful and wasteful.<p>So, the crucial stuff unique to the project took the least time.  The rest of the work unique to the project took much more time but still was fast, fun, and easy.  Work on (1)-(6) essentially independent of the project took maybe 80% of the time.<p>In particular, the most valuable work, that gives the project some potential, took the least time;\nroutine work still unique to the project took much more time but still was fast; nearly all the time went for work not unique to the project.<p>Why?  There is good/bad news:  Some of the good news is that there is now so much infrastructure software that write less of own code and use code written by others.  The bad news is that when using code written by others, also need to use their documentation, and for the industry so far writing good documentation is, in practice, essentially too difficult.  E.g., I had to use just the TIFO method to determine what would be the value of Request.UrlReferrer.  As far as I could tell from my 4000+ Web pages of documentation, the only way to know was the TIFO method.  Then, of course, in my code I did put some documentation.  I wish I didn't have to write my own documentation of the tools I am using from others.<p>Net, what's crucial and unique to a project may not take the most time.  That is, the work that takes the most time may not be the most important work.  And, then, can't measure importance to a project of some work by the time the work took.",1363456127

It's not like having windows installed on a laptop is increasing its cost by $100.\nAnd why does a company mentioned in this article have a problem with Windows already pre-installed? Installation of Linux on such a machine is exactly the same as if there was no OS on it in the first place. Heck, they could even leave Windows and install Linux as a second OS,but make it boot by default - and then have it as an extra selling point - Linux computers,but with Windows as an option. \nWindows 8 is not sealing anything yet. And EFI problems are easy to overcome if you want to - and if your business depends on it, I believe that it would be in your best interest to want to??\nTo sum it all up - I believe that this entire story is made up and no shop even existed in the first place. If they could sell linux computers 3 or 5 years ago they could still do it today, and it seems like the entire article is constructed to just blame MS for problems that don't exist.",1363455829

It boils down to a mobile app that could be cloned, bit-for-bit, for way under $5 million.""</i><p>I had an argument about this yesterday with someone. I do not think this statement is true.<p>Mailbox is an app that, usability, design, and technology-wise is two standard deviations away from the mean iPhone app. It is anything but commodity.<p>If you assembled a team of pretty-decent devs and designers, you probably couldn't clone Mailbox. To be blunt, the quality of Mailbox's app is <i>beyond the capabilities</i> of almost every mobile engineering team I've ever come across, and I write mobile apps for a living.<p>You could <i>try</i> cloning Mailbox, but it's contingent on first building a truly world-class design and mobile development team - and I mean world-class literally, you need to build a mobile team two standard deviations away from what every startup has. Assembling a team at this level is <i>really</i> friggin' hard. Mailbox has somehow done it - there's no guarantee that Dropbox could do it independently.<p>It might seem a bit hyperbolic, but apps like Mailbox are sort of like the mobile equivalent of Google - there's a magic sauce and team there that makes it non-trivial to clone. We're not talking about an app that bolts together standard UI components and pours some fresh paint on top, this is something that's at the very extreme end of UX quality.<p>> <i>""Dropbox has a pretty strong brand of its own already.""</i><p>I highly doubt Dropbox gives a shit about the Mailbox brand as it stands. The idea is to have the absolute best email client money can buy - and that competitors will have a hell of a time trying to clone. The whole idea is to be able to go ""Sign up for Dropbox, make email <i>way</i> easier than blech! iPhone email. And way easier than even GMail!""<p>> <i>""I can't imagine mailbox.app would fare all that well against a (near identical) dropboxmail.app""</i><p>This rests on the assumption that Dropbox <i>can</i> clone Mailbox. Having used the Dropbox app extensively, this is a <i>really</i> unsafe assumption. Dropbox's mobile app quality right now is pretty middling - not bad, but not great. For them to even start approaching the ability to clone Mailbox they'd first have to build a brand new team at a level few companies have been able to achieve.<p>And even if they did, an app like Mailbox is not something a few people can bang out in a couple of months. IMO Dropbox would be <i>easily</i> at least a year behind Mailbox. All the while other cloud competitors are looking for the leg up and willing to acquire Mailbox also.<p>> <i>""By that logic their next move will be to pull another Color.app?""</i><p>If people ever gave a shit about Color.app. Color was a flop right out of the gate. Mailbox has received rave reviews from just about everyone who's touched it, and the demand continues to be furious.<p>If Dropbox will acquire a photo sharing app, it will have to hit that bar - i.e., absolute best in class experience, existing buzz, and <i>not a pointless app no one knows what to do with</i>.",1363455660

If you take into account the initial marble velocity and rate of rotation of the wheel, you can seriously reduce the probability space of where the ball will land. Further, this can be modelled statistically pretty simply.<p>To win at betting with roulette you only need to bet on a set of numbers, where the probability of the marble landing on that set is pretty good, and the payout of winning over time covers the losses from being wrong.<p>So say you can accurately guess which 1/4 of the wheel will capture the marble. (and there are no greens... the real math is the same but uglier a bit). You put down equal bets on the 9 numbers represented by that. Each beting round will net you a 4:1 payout.<p>Now say you can only guess that 1/4 of the wheel, 50% of the time. You will still average a 2:1 payout.<p>Guessing the 1/4 of the board 50% of the time is not that hard, you just need to calculate the linear drift of the time the marble passes a fixed point, and know the frequency of ""loops"" that is too slow for the marble to stay on the track. Accounting for the rotation of the board is straight-forward, it is almost constant for a given play. The 50% covers the wierd bounces. Just calculate board position for the time that the marble will get below the threshold, and the marble position as well, and you've won. A person can't do it well, but an arduino is overkill for it.<p><i>Edit: further notes on this- casinos will be able to detect this easily. All they have to do is look for people on hot streaks that are ""too hot"", then compare betting placement with wheel positions. And they generally kick people out who are winning too much anyway, even if they can't prove 'chaeting'.</i>",1363454354

Folks look around on the subway and see that everyone is on their smart phones, and many are playing games. It's still very unclear to me however, to what extent smart phones are affecting Nintendo's business, and how Nintendo should adjust their business model in response.<p>Nintendo just announced[1] that Fire Emblem: Awakening for the 3DS smashed franchise sales records, selling 180k copies in the first month (a month plagued by shortages[2]) and selling more than a third of those units via their own digital distribution store. For perspective the lifetime sales of the previous Fire Emblem title was only 250k.<p>This game is selling out at $40 and 1/3 of the sales are online sales that they don't have to share with anyone else (still $40!). One of the main reasons why I don't think Nintendo should become a software only is company that I don't see how they can remain as profitable if they had to adjust their prices for the realities of the iOS market and had to share their profits with Apple. The most profitable games on mobile stores are free to play titles, and while I think Nintendo should experiment here and develop their own F2P games to test that market, I don't see why they couldn't do that on their own platform.<p>[1] <a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/14/3dss-fire-emblem-awakening-sells-180k-in-february-more-than-a-third-of-that-through-eshop/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/14/3dss-fire-emblem-awakening...</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=511036&highlight=fire+emblem+retailers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=511036&highligh...</a>",1363453900

7798755,comment,7797335,7798653,7,0,leephillips,,,"&quot;the RSS spec&quot;<p>RSS was invented at Netscape with no involvement by Winer. Most informed people starting fresh today would tend to prefer the Atom format.<p>&quot;XML-RPC, SOAP, OPML&quot;<p>Some of the &quot;interesting ideas&quot; that I acknowledged. Most people today would prefer REST if possible, although there is a lot of legacy and enterprise stuff that uses, especially, SOAP. OPML is obviously useful, if obvious.<p>&quot;arguably podcasts were first implemented by Winer&quot;<p>Automatically downloadable audio files were already in place in several forms before Winer got involved, including subscriptions. Winer and Curry implemented RSS enclosures and used them to deliver audio files. This is an implementation of the existing podcast concept using RSS, and probably helped make podcasting more popular.<p>The RSS spec is something that a motivated high school student could come up with in a couple of hours. Why grown men consider it an accomplishment and argue about who should get the credit is embarrassing. The real value comes in building a consensus to create an accepted standard. Did Winer do more to help this process along, or to obstruct it? What about stunts like making trivial changes to an existing spec and slapping Userland&#x27;s copyright on it? What effect did that have on helping to establish the RSS spec as a standard? Edit: The Atom format owes its existence mainly to the desire to create a work-alike that avoids the RSS version mess, which resulted from Winer&#x27;s antics. Mark Pilgrim early on defined Atom as &quot;RSS without the sociopaths.&quot;<p>And I referred to &quot;products&quot; as flops; you mentioned standards and protocols. The products I&#x27;m referring to are Radio and its many precursors and descendants. Do you think that any of these products were successful?",1401080213

Iran was a moderately religious country, not fundamentalist, before the Revolution, and for the most part, it still is. Iranians are educated and intelligent people.<p>Iranians know that when they vote, their votes aren&#x27;t worth much. They know the Council and really, the Supreme Leader call the real shots. But they still vote, and in larger numbers than Americans, primarily to demonstrate that they have faith in their government, and they would rather it exist than not.<p>Most likely, Iran is going to forget the unspeakable harms the United States has committed against it as its people age and the pain of living under a foreign power&#x27;s puppet dictator recedes from the national consciousness. And when that happens, Iran will liberalize of its own accord, and all of America&#x27;s saber-rattling and sanctions will have done nothing.<p>Iran does not need to make an enemy of the United States. The United States made an enemy out of Iran when it committed acts of war for the sake of corporate profits. Iran just hasn&#x27;t forgotten.",1401080036

If you buy a mobile phone on ebay, or if you buy one on amazon and it isn&#x27;t fulfilled directly by the manufacturer, I don&#x27;t think you can have any assurance that it is truly a brand new, factory produced device.

Bunnie speaks of the value of his spare parts, but the box and the manual would probably have been of equal value.<p>Second, I was surprised by the near total absence of anything truly <i>interesting</i> ... I spent 2.5 days looking for any tools or devices related to osmocom/openBTS/openBSC ... sim cloning, sim tracing, IMSI catching ... development kits or test hardware... and I saw not even a trace of this.

7798715,comment,7797134,7797638,1,0,Detrus,,,"I&#x27;ve read the book many times, looked at reputable youtube videos, had people with perfect form try to correct mine and still have trouble understanding how to do the lifts perfectly. My brain just turns off during the workout and takes a while to come back. Starting Strength&#x27;s 30 pages per lift are also overwhelming. I really only need a checklist of 30 things per lift and have to figure out which to emphasize for my crap posture, knees out, chest up, etc.<p>My numbers should be better, 2.7 years, 185 BW, 400 lb deadlift, 275 bench, 275x5 squat, 150 OHP. All thanks to crappy form, not understanding how to do the exercise properly. People with hunchback posture have a lot more to think about than those with good posture. I got to 375x5 deadlift within 1.5 years. But my form was already crap at 245 and I had no idea because I only checked with video at 225. Also filmed myself and couldn&#x27;t tell what I was doing wrong, looked ok as far as I could tell at the time. But it was wrong. My idea of how to deadlift/squat/OHP was fundamentally wrong at 1.5 year mark. Bench needed major corrections.<p>You might be doing it wrong too, you can get away with it for a long time.<p>A trainer at some globo gym like Planet Fitness, Bally etc. won&#x27;t promise correct form for 300 lb deadlifters, even if they pull 500 lb themselves. They&#x27;re just there to make total novices feel comfortable.<p>If you want proper training you need to find a freeweight focused place like a powerlifting gym, maybe crossfit and pay whatever obnoxious price they charge for personal attention.

I said new <i>diamond</i> mining companies are probably a very tough sell, for the reasons I gave. A new mineral without a highly concentrated competitive landscape, or which is extremely plentiful in multiple countries, is probably a much better investment.<p>Read the article. De Beers didn&#x27;t lose market share to a new mining start up, they lost it because political issues caused certain partners to leave the cartel (especially the Russian and Australian mines).<p>It was only when the cartel was severely weakened that the newer Canadian mines were able to opt to sell their diamonds independently, at which point De Beers had already fallen to 50%. Even these mines are not startups: the Diavik mine is majority owned by Rio Tinto.<p>>>> But look, if you&#x27;re going to just keep inflating perfectly normal business barriers that affect any kind of business into reasons why somebody shouldn&#x27;t get specifically into the diamond business, then it&#x27;s you who probably shouldn&#x27;t get into the diamond business.<p>My point is that the barriers are harder for diamond mining than for other businesses, like chat apps in 2011. Dismissing the barriers for a highly capital intensive and risky industry with a small number of major players seems reckless and makes it hard to take your points seriously.<p>>>> Somebody else with investment capital to burn sourcing product and building a market, like every other business in history, shouldn&#x27;t let you get in the way.<p>Nobody is standing in your way.

If you manage to fuck that up in your file, then take a look in the mirror, because the problem is you. Enforcing the practice of enclosing the target data in quotation marks among users is a good idea. It&#x27;s something that should be supported and encouraged, and ignored at one&#x27;s own risk.<p>Additionally, employing an escape character (such as backslash) to allow for the use of a quotation mark within enclosing quotation marks is a nice feature to add in.

A lot of non-technical people learned at least some programming, because of this. When GUIs came this faded out.<p>A similar parallel in the 90s with the internet is that people learned HTML, because in many ways tools were limited and it was relatively easy to create a page that was respectable enough. Now that so many web pages are &quot;covered&quot; in CSS and/or created with higher level tools, it will be interesting to see if many non-technical people will be attracted to creating their own web pages. I hope so.",1372463978

5960967,comment,5959020,5959676,5,0,jcheng,,,"> And closures for things like callbacks for AJAX etc. -- these are generally fine, because once the AJAX returns and the callback function finishes executing, then once the AJAX object gets garbage-collected, the callback will too, and its closure.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that this is as fine as you think it is. Those callbacks may invoke other callbacks, which may access any variable that&#x27;s in its lexical scope, and as the Meteor bug shows, you may be inadvertently holding on to not the callback itself, but the environment it lives in.<p>I think this may be exacerbated in promise-oriented Node.js code since it is so easy to take a promise and stash it in a list or object (which we do in my current project[0], and indeed this code has been the source of memory leaks in the past and may still be leaking).<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-server/blob/master/lib/scheduler/scheduler.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-server/blob/master/lib/sche...</a>",1372463919

In some cases this manifests itself in more syntactical ways; C&#x27;s pragmatic but unsophisticated approach typing works well for C, but starts to become a real burden when you start adding more sophisticated concepts onto the language.

I am just wondering.

Surely in reality it would not be worth sorting the array just to optimize the branches in the loop. The branchless version somebody posted is effective, but it&#x27;s hard to read and brittle. The Intel compiler seemed like the optimal solution if you have it.<p>I&#x27;ve found architecture effects fairly hard to predict in real situations, with my level of knowledge. I think it&#x27;s hard to reduce these to straightforward lessons. It&#x27;s useful to know that things like branch mispredictions and cache misses are important, but you should probably not try to optimize for them until you&#x27;ve timed the loop and built up a good case for what&#x27;s occurring. Most of the time, when I think I can make something faster that way, I rewrite the code and it&#x27;s no faster.<p>One case where something did get faster was in a case where I had two large arrays, one containing indexes into the other, which contained data, and I needed to permute the data by the indexes and write it out to a file. Initially, the indexes were arranged so that the output was sequential, but the array accesses were random. I switched out the array of indexes with its inverse, which would access the data sequentially, but produce output in random order, which I captured in a new array before writing out. The second version was measurably faster. The lesson seems to be that loads benefit more from locality than stores. In the end, though, it only saved a fraction of a second, even with 100 million elements in the array. Unoptimized, it was already pretty fast, taking slightly over a second. It was nice, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend too much time on it.<p>I think this kind of optimization is somewhat like saving money by doing your own plumbing. It&#x27;s usually not worth it unless you know what you&#x27;re doing, or you can afford to spend lots of time.<p>Edit: Reading more of the comments, I found something useful that I didn&#x27;t know. The ternary ?: operator generates a conditional move rather than a branch. So that&#x27;s a viable solution, although it came out a little slower than the predictable branch.",1372463276

On my site, the users in red would actually be correct, i.e. logging out of my site would log you out of Facebook. This is also the more logical, consistent and secure approach, because if the user stays logged in on Facebook even after pressing &quot;log out&quot; on my app, just pressing the &quot;connect on facebook&quot; button again would log the user in without asking for a password. This is not secure.<p>It&#x27;s quite simple: when a user is signed out on your app, use the javascript SDK to sign-out the user from Facebook as well. You can easily do this by loading the SDK, subscribing to the status-event, and if (user is not signed in in my application) && (facebook SDK says user is signed in to facebook), then call FB.logout().<p>This is a workaround though, you should just combine both when pressing the &quot;sign-out&quot; button of your website - i.e. send an ajax request to the sign-out page, send an FB.logout request to facebook, redirect user when complete. That has the added advantage that any time a user visits your page, and the client-side SDK tells you the user is connected through Facebook, you can automatically sign-in that user.<p>I&#x27;ve just completed going through the API and everything so I have a pretty good grasp of things right now, I should write a blogpost about how to properly implement Facebook sign-in, because Facebook is traditionally quite lacking on documentation, and definitely doesn&#x27;t give a clear view of best practices.",1372460943

5960791,comment,5959740,5959740,1,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"This discussion on the NSA/CIA/DOJ/etc is teetering on the edge of respectability. Now every Tom, Dick, and Harry with an axe to grind is out running around yelling about some new abuse -- even if the story is a bit thin.<p>As tptacek says, this isn&#x27;t a new thing. It&#x27;s not even something that&#x27;s all that interesting, frankly. People from various agencies cross-pollinate all of the time. If worked a boring analyst job at CIA, I might love taking a leave of absence and helping the cops out some. Sounds like fun.<p>Sure, it would be news if the CIA actually ran operations in NYC, but this story is about employees of the CIA being embedded in the NYC police, not about secret CIA operations inside the country. That&#x27;s a different can of worms. Perhaps something bad happened. Don&#x27;t know. This story doesn&#x27;t inform us of it. Instead we just get vague allegations without proof. As the report states, this is an unusual <i>personnel situation</i>, not some massive policy disaster. The rest of it is just blown out of proportion by this author.<p>I&#x27;ve said this before, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll say it again: the biggest problem with these freedom or safety stories is that people get way too passionate, try to interject their own narrative about how things work, lay on the paranoia thickly, and have a good old Donnybrook. Might get a lot of page views like that, but it&#x27;s not useful.<p>People should be really concerned about what&#x27;s going on in the US with regards to the security state. This is a serious problem and it deserves our passion. But &quot;being concerned&quot; and &quot;having your chain yanked&quot; are two different things. Smart folks know the difference. I&#x27;m not pointing a finger at this author precisely, but I&#x27;m starting to see a lot of overly-emotional, hand-waving tripe coming across the wires in the guise of various kinds of &quot;breaking stories&quot;",1372460731

Is this actually your interpretation of the present state of affairs in the US, or is it just how you think things ought to be?<p>>The validity of moral imperatives and rights does not depend on the existence of any law.<p>That&#x27;s not a point of disagreement here. The question is whether, in addition to the other moral imperatives, there is a (defeasible) moral imperative to obey the law.<p>>In my opinion, criminal law is just a device to facilitate obedience to moral imperatives.<p>Again, this is a fantasy view of the law, not one that can possibly be applied in practice. Consider theft. How are you going to determine, in every case, whether it is morally justified that someone owns something? You can always go back and find an injustice in the chain of events which leads to ownership. Or take a clear case, say, Bernie Madoff.

I wonder why 5.5% overall cuts translate to 20% cuts. The SciMag article makes it seems like they were only cutting the number of grants not the size which kinda makes sense. Perhaps they are treating funded grants worse which seems crazy. Wouldn't this potentially waste the money already spent if the project can't be finished on 20% less?<p>Good luck with omnisci.org this is the sort of thing that would help: open sharing of data, techniques and negative results.

People who manage to struggle through it and create art are doing it <i>despite</i> their disease and not because of it. The romanticism that is attached to the suffering artist is incredibly frustrating and, I think, dangerous. It leads people to believe that it is okay or worthwhile or noble to let this illness rule over you. We don't celebrate cancer or dementia or schizophrenia as ""gifts"". Sometimes people suffering from those illnesses are able to create beautiful works, but we don't romanticize their diseases because of it. Why would/should we do that with depression?",1368172326

But I think some people just like being _good_, full stop.  But of course you don't know what ""good"" means without comparing yourself to other people, which means it's sort of epistemically connected to competition.  But I think it's still not the same thing.<p>ALSO, I can think of several thought experiments that appear to contradict CN, and I'll add yours to the list, because I totally agree.  I've met kids like that, including an ex-friend who rebounded from his parents' forced piano lessons so hard that he ended up confined to the psych ward.  He mastered piano AND violin, but he didn't develop passion for either.<p>Here's another example that is contrastive with CN.  I personally am fascinated by dissecting P&P RPG rules, and assessing which are ""good"" according to an ill-defined metric that interests no one but me.  Does it even make sense to talk about mastery at this activity?  I can remember being interested in this when I was a little kid; it's an enduring passion.  I don't think it's explicable by ""mastery"".<p>These situations illustrate what I meant by ""this summary only captures one side of passion"".<p>ON THE OTHER HAND...<p>I do believe that many-or-all people derive enjoyment from mastery, and at some point this is related to passion.  I think the reason I like video games SO MUCH is partly because they let me experience the sensation of mastery, cheaply.  When you combine that with a goal of being economically relevant (a goal that I think has both ethical and selfish motivations), it makes sense to cultivate mastery at something useful-and-not-antifun, and hope that the mastery becomes a passion.<p>And to reply to your cousin-comment, I think some people are masterful and passionate about getting the details right, and they can be tax auditors, and their passion overlaps with their work.  And some people can be masterful and passionate about intricate systems, and about securing victories, and they can be patent lawyers and their passion overlaps with their work.  I am 100% sure there are passionate patent lawyers.  And some people can be masterful and passionate about... bullying people?  I dunno if anyone can be passionate about debt collection, actually, but two outta three ain't bad.",1368171891

5685068,comment,5684773,5684909,15,0,nostrademons,,,"Do you not feel emotions, or do you not feel empathy?<p>The former is called alexithymia.  It literally means ""no words for emotions"", and is experienced as an inability to identify emotional states in oneself.  A person may still <i>experience</i> emotions and act on them, but they're unaware of which emotion they're feeling at any given time - for example, they may snap at or say something nasty to a close acquaintance, but be unaware that they were angry or that their words would be hurtful to the other person.  Alexithymia isn't a disorder in itself, but it's a symptom that can indicate other disorders.  Common causes include dismissive/avoidant attachment disorder, autism spectrum disorders, avoidant or schizoid personality disorders, or sometimes PTSD and emotional trauma.<p>Lack of empathy means an inability to put yourself in someone else's shoes and imagine someone else's perspective.  It's actually divided into two categories: a deficiency in emotional empathy means an inability to understand others' emotional states (and is closely related to alexithymia, as you usually can't identify emotions in others if you can't identify them in yourself) and is commonly associated with sociopathy, schizophrenia, and narcissism; while cognitive empathy is your ability to imagine yourself in another's shoes and take on their perspective given their differing information, and is frequently deficient with autism spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder, or borderline personality disorder.",1368170984

That they only caught the runners (the guys going to the ATM's with cards) and not the group leaders or the hackers suggests they were caught via traditional ID methods via ATM cameras[1], mobile phone or car license plates.<p>The other evidence to support this theory is that the runners in other countries were not arrested or charged at the same time. If law enforcement took these guys down from the top, you'd think they would be able to also ID the runners in other countries.<p>Instead, only the group of runners organized around New York were caught - 8 people, out of a group that would number at least 50 or more.<p>I also don't understand the money laundering charge. The defendants deposited $150k in $20 bills into a Miami bank and then used the account to buy a car. That isn't doing a very good job of hiding the source of funds, if that is what their intention was.<p>Seems very amateur and unworthy of a professional criminal organization - more likely it was the proceeds of a cut that one of the runners got.<p>[1] During the Boston Marathon Bombing manhunt the Feds released pictures that were taken from an ATM showing Suspect #2 (later identified as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev):<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/0ZF7ud9.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/0ZF7ud9.png</a><p>From the pictures you can see that ATM's take a photo when the user is approaching and while they are using the ATM (the first picture seems to be triggered by the door being opened).

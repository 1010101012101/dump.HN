533535,comment,532634,533343,0,0,gcv,,,"So the primary reason for moving stuff out of the database in this particular example is not performance, but storage constraints. Relational databases are notorious for being exceedingly difficult to scale beyond a dataset which fits on one server. If you have a giant blob stored in every row, you'll grow out of the database's one-server storage capacity much more quickly than if you take that blob and store it someplace else. If your data row instead includes columns 'server' and 'path', you can easily distribute your blobs across multiple servers.<p>In the example in the video, the team took the concept a step further and (1) stored the blobs in S3, and (2) served them to the users straight out of S3. That way, they pay for S3 storage, but not for their own machines for storing or serving up those blobs.",1238079422

Integrating lessons with Wikipedia, blogs etc... could be quite useful, however. Chances are that children already use all these tools to complete their homework assignments, so ""teaching them"" technology probably shows how out of touch education authorities are with the average primary school child. Children certainly don't need to be taught how to use a spell checker!",1238079403

On this thread  <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=521298"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=521298</a> I wrote about using online textbooks at my daughter's high school.  Last night I met with the principal and some faculty who are very interested in starting a pilot program to move at least a couple of classes to online books.  My task is to find out what materials to use - e-booksdirectory.com could hardly be more perfect - and how to access them in the classroom.<p>So how would any of you recommend using online books in the classroom (high school level)?

For me, programming was/is a means to an end, not something <i>I</i> enjoyed doing.. but helping other people to learn and enjoy programming is something I enjoy.

It helps, but I don't think it's a prerequisite to being a good educator.)",1238076541

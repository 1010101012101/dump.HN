2548020,comment,2547679,2547850,5,0,pstack,,,"A very valid point. As others have stated, buying a home should be more about quality of life and living than making a buck and that has to be on your time schedule; not someone else's. The worst thing you can ever do is buy a home when you're not ready for a home -- and you know better than anyone else if you're ready.<p>When you start waking up in the morning and thinking ""god damn, I wish I had a home, so I could . . ."" then it might be time to start giving it consideration. For me, I had dealt with a home invasion. I'd lived in my apartment for five years and someone walked in while I was asleep and stole everything (the layout of the apartment was such that I wasn't disturbed by the intruder - if you were in the back bedroom, you couldn't even hear someone banging on the front door). I lived alone. Nobody else had keys . . . except the leasing and maintenance offices. Took $30k worth of stuff.<p>So, I started waking up in the mornings feeling a bit unsafe, wishing I had a sweet surveillance/alarm system, and also thinking about how great it would be to have room for my entertainment system (and get to blast it as loud as I wanted). Also, I kind of still want to get a dog and that wouldn't have worked in the apartment. Enough things started to bug me that I just sat up one day and said ""let's go look at houses"".<p>Until you are home shopping for those reasons (or similar reasons of your own), then you may be doing it for all the wrong reasons. Maybe because friends are all buying homes. Maybe because you feel like you're still a ""kid"" as long as you keep renting. Who knows?<p>In the mean time, definitely don't buy into the idea that you have to go for it because people around you are talking about it and you feel like you're missing out. You might be the sanest of them all. I didn't buy a home until I was starting into my 30s. I could have done it a decade before and went so far as to check out homes and even get approved for loans. It just never felt quite right, until last year. And I have been happy that I finally did so, when I did.<p>Well-being accounts for a lot, too. Whatever you may be losing ""on paper"" with renting, you may be compensated for in peace of mind, right now. You can focus on work and savings and family rather than finding a trustworthy and affordable lawn service, worrying if your boiler is going to make it another year, wondering why in the hell that sink is draining slowly, when it isn't clogged up, wondering how much it would cost to turn that spare room into a sex dungeon. . .",1305392089

  - Property damage by acts of god (flooding/fire/subsidence).
  - Default on payments & long eviction periods.
  - Low occupancy/months without rent.
  - Downward price movements in the market as a whole.
  - Downward price movements in your location due to ghettoization, tax increases, service/school decline, structural unemployment or other factors.
</code></pre>
Could be worth it for the gain in equity, but it's something to think about - especially as some of these risks can't be insured against.<p>You are also forgoing returns on your existing equity if you invested it elsewhere. Risk free interest rates for retail deposits here in the UK are currently above 3% for example.<p>In addition to that you also have the costs (in time and money) of:<p><pre><code>  - Management time/effort.
  - Time to deal with renters and searches.
  - Organizing maintenance.

They're looking into things because they seem like a good idea, but it's clear that they're equally open to discovering that they weren't that great an idea after all.<p>That last part - a form of idea edit and review - is something that I see a lot of companies lose very quickly. They get so caught up in what they think they <i>should</i> be doing (or how they define themselves, e.g. ""we are a social media company"") that they lose the ability to let go of ideas that just don't work, even when it seems like they should. Apple is really good at this. For every product that Apple actually announces, there are hundreds that never make it off the ground. The iPad idea had been floating around Apple for <i>years</i>, but it wasn't approved until mobile technology had come far enough to make it actually a practical idea, not just a good idea.<p>There's a saying that behind every great poet is a great editor.

Improved compilers, faster computers, and multi-core compilation have made it moot.<p>Often you'll see a C++ basher bring up compilation speed and then in the same thread advocate python + C as the happy medium, which I find crazy. C++ is so much higher level than C the need for scripting is often obviated. I've typically got about 2x SLOC expansion rewriting perl/python as C++, including stuff like headers, so really not much more code at all, just 100x faster and a tiny fraction the memory.<p>The other line you see, including elsewhere on this page right now, is that C and C++ are the right tool for the job in different domains. I really don't get this. C++ is straight-up a replacement for C. There is no C program that wouldn't be shorter and clearer rewritten as C++. The only occasion to not use C++ is when you don't have compiler support, which is extremely rarely a concern anymore. Even the lowest level embedded stuff is moving away from C in favor of C++.",1305391546

I had used google voice as a test a few months ago, and spent the better part of 5 minutes trying to figure out how to do it again - but failed - and I'm obviously highly technical.

I spoke vaguely because the benefits themselves are ambiguous, subjective. They are hard to quantify because their intrinsic value varies based on who you ask.<p>However, just because they are not easily quantifiable does not mean that they have no value. You are right. It is easy for me to sit over here and criticize them for not discussing something that was probably outside the scope of their article.<p>With that said though, it may be possible - one day - for someone to figure out some way of approximating these things (no landlords, lower fixed monthly costs, more control over your own property) and giving them some type of monetary value.<p>One thing that could be done is to look at the difference between rent and ownership prices and build an econometric model in an attempt to tease some numbers out of it. Maybe someone has already tried it, but I am not certain. There would be some selection bias though - the kind of people that own homes are probably not exactly the same as those that rent apartments. I'm not sure how to deal with that...<p>Just something to think about, I have taken some classes in Urban economics and all of these professors talk about how incredibly stupid it is to own a house. Then, over the course of the semester, I would realize that they owned houses myself. When I ask them why, none of them has a decent answer.<p>Maybe the answer is something really sort-of fuzzy. It seems to me that people tend to buy a house when they want to lay down ""roots"" in a place, but then that wouldn't explain why so many people just rent for a long time despite not needing the mobility.<p>There are probably hundreds of factors that creep into the decision to own vs to rent. I guess being aware of this is why I feel repulsed at articles claiming to compare the two but not even trying to factor in the preference-related factors and how they cloud this type of analysis.<p>Disclaimer: I am an economist-in-training at this point in time. My thesis involves an application of a hedonic pricing model. Too much work with hedonics and you may become delirious - believing that everything can be quantified if you just tinker with the model long enough...",1305391334
2547991,comment,2547679,2547927,7,0,pstack,,,"I think the point is long-term thinking. As you mentioned, over the life of a 30 year mortgage, I'm likely to have paid about double what I bought the house for. However, that's $900/mo today and that'll be $900/mo in 30 years. In 10 years, that'll be worth $675/mo, in 20 it'll be worth $495/mo and in 30 it'll be worth $270/mo. Meanwhile, the unit I was renting will probably be $1,500, $2,136, and $2,760.<p>So, I think even the expenses I've incurred (I replaced the power junction box and ugpraded it from 50amp to 200amp, installed several dedicated circuits, and did tons of other work to this place) will seem small in the long run, as will the interest included in my mortgage. Of course, I only have a 30yr mortgage as a failsafe. So that ""if things go really bad, I only am obligated to a certain amount per month"". Unless things go totally awry, I'm expecting to pay it off in half that time, which will be an <i>enormous</i> savings. (Also, payment on mortgage interest is tax deductible).<p>And best of all, in the end, I have a house and property to show for it. So even if it came out to be on par with renting for thirty years, I don't end up owning anything at the end of those three decades when I'm renting.<p>Of course, in the meantime, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that something doesn't arise that requires me to move and spoil the whole plan. That would suck. But the long term game will be beneficial. That's an admitted risk I have to take, since just about none of us can ever be absolutely sure that we'll still be where we are in five, ten, fifteen, or twenty years.",1305391327

The problem that the author of this article has identified lies more in moderation then the comment system.<p>Comments have evolved.  Many high profile sites rely on passive, one way comments that are occasionally peppered with the odd reply, but for the most part act solely as the receptacle of one-way feedback.  This isn't necessarily bad and at one time, provided adequate engagement.<p>Today, readers have become accustom to community and participation rather then simple contribution.  We expect more, but we don't receive it.<p>The solution is a mix of additional functionality, increased participation and eventually clear identification of authority.<p>Additional Functionality:
We've seen basic moderation systems evolve.  From Digg style voting buttons to full on wiki style comment systems where users can add sources and refine messages, there have been technological advances that have been largely overlooked in commenting systems.<p>Increased participation:
This is more then simply encouraging users to comment.  Users need to be engaged and that happens by the author in the comments.  After an article is composed, authors need to become conductors and individually guide conversations and continue to contribute their ideas and messages.  Generally, commenters need to have their thoughts validated while the article is thought of as an introduction to a topic while the comments contain the larger message being presented.<p>Authority:
Comment systems such as Disqus and Facebook Comments gather contributions across blogs.  All of the comments a commenter has made are available through a common system that supersedes individual articles.  This needs to be expanded and improved.  Comment systems need to identify authority and encourage ""cross seeding"" through related people, their individual expertise and the interests they share.<p>We're getting there.

My rent increased between five and ten percent every year the five years prior to buying my home. Therefore, my home purchase (per the calculator) comes out as the better solution in only four years.<p>Also, buying last year had the added bonus of an $8,000 tax credit. Not a discount on your income, but an actual dollar for dollar credit (ie, come tax time, I add $8,000 to the refund amount). That's seven months of rent at my prior place. Not a bad deal. Thanks to the deductions from paying my mortgage (versus no tax deduction that I'd have gotten with renting), I saved just enough money on qualified income to fall under the first time home buyer credit limit. Worked out well.<p>Anyway, it definitely depends on where you live. Circumstances change drastically, even within a state. Even just outside of a main metro area. San Jose is cheaper than San Francisco. Beaverton is cheaper than downtown Portland. Westminster is cheaper than Denver. In some places, owning will simply never be an option. I couldn't afford a million bucks for a 900sqft home in San Francisco. Hell, I could probably barely afford rent.<p>Based on my personal experience, I would advise people to buy sooner than later. That is, I personally wish I'd have bought five or ten years earlier. On the other hand, I think I was also wise to wait until just the right time in my life and the market to buy and I think that's a wise path to take, too. You may be putting off the benefits of a home if you delay, but at least you're not making any commitments by paying rent, either. In the long run, I think that is the mistake too many people make. They feel the ticking clock and buy because everyone else says that's what adults do. That leads to buying too much and extending yourself and your credit too far.

Most people don't ever see the distinction.<p>The article focuses on the bad things, sure, but there are already a ton of articles written out there about why ""renting is stupid, buying (mortgaging)  you can't lose!)<p>I rented for a long time. Proudly.  People told me I was throwing my money away.  I ignored them, I liked the simplicity and mobility.
And the savings.<p>Then one day I bought (not mortgaged) a home.  I bought it not primarily as an investment but as a home, for my family.  Some day I'll probably sell it and move on to something bigger, but whether that means I take a loss, a gain, or whatever isn't the point - the benefit is that, for now, I don't have to worry about dealing with landlords, and my expenses on a monthly basis are lower, so if I lose my job or otherwise come into financial hardship, my home won't be on the line (and no I'm not ignoring taxes and other stuff - I'm well aware of my local obligations where I live)<p>All that said - speaking vaguely of the ""benefits"" of home ownership doesn't communicate much - perhaps you can elaborate on what you see as those benefits?  I know what mine are - but it's subjective.<p>And to re-iterate - many people get mixed up when deciding whether to mortgage a home - they can't or don't find a way to properly evaluate the financial benefits and risks -vs- the ""soft"" lifestyle benefits and risks - two very different things.",1305389371

I have always been perplexed by this - especially because you can only upvote, no downvoting is in (yet).<p>The funny thing is that back in the day (when I first started commenting over there) they did not have any type of voting and it could get bad sometimes. Users begged for voting and we got it, now things are pretty nifty for all commenters.<p>Maybe it is because a different group of users frequents the Economist.

What sort of customers could benefit from using Salesforce? That's an easier market size number to find, and it can be a single number (for example corporations that use some form of CRM), or a number you come up with yourself (adding different industries that you think could benefit by using salesforce).<p>After I get an estimate for that number, I then apply that innovators are 2.5% of the market, early adopters 13.5%, early majority 34%, and laggards 16%.

2547902,comment,2541853,2544533,1,0,patrickj,,,"Yes I do original research all the time, every day. I beta test apps, I assess pre-release versions of apps from many leading publishers, I explore and test new functionality, or getting more out of existing functionality, I jailbreak my devices at times to see what more they're capable of, and so on. The AirPrint subject is a good example. I did not just 'scour the big blogs'. Before AirPrint was ever released, when many people believed it was impossible to print from the iPad, I did an article that proved quite popular that explained that you absolutely could print from the iPad, via several good 3rd party apps. When AirPrint was released along with iOS 4.2 I wrote several pieces criticizing it for being lame and worse than half-assed compared to what Apple had touted it to be. I wrote articles on how to use AirPrint, how to get more and better features via 3rd party apps, and how the list of supported printers has grown at a snail's pace. And yes, I also posted on the tweak  that eventually came out to extend AirPrint's own functionality. Not because I was following the big blogs, or anyone else, not because I jumped on the AirPrint bandwagon late in the day, but because I had been covering the subject extensively all along.<p>My 100 articles a month and were they all quality posts: Yes they were and are. Is every single one of them a new in-depth app review or how-to post, No. I sometimes write shorter pieces offering my opinion on a major bit of iPad news or similar. I sometimes write lighter pieces, about anything from iPad-related humor to how my big goofy Labrador is my work colleague. I think that provides a nice mix of content for readers.<p>If Apple announces the date that a new iPad is going to be released, or that they are finally going to support subscription plans for iPad magazines and newspapers, that's of interest to me and to my readers, so I mix in a small percentage of original news coverage as well. The fact that many sites may cover the same story does not mean that mine is not original or professionally written content. When there is a major news story, it is covered by The New York Times, The Washington Post, and other quality broadsheet papers. When there are major political and economic stories, they are all covered by Time, by Newsweek, by The Economist, and so on. Does that mean that none of these titles are producing original or professional content? When any of these big titles pick up stories from the AP, Reuters, and smaller local news outlets, does that mean they are suddenly low-quality titles? I'd say absolutely not. And when a small %age of my posts cover major news, it doesn't mean I'm a low quality site either. I always have my own take any iPad related news or rumors that I choose to write on.  I don't 'borrow' anybody else's take - I write my own thoughts on the very few news or rumor items that interest me.<p>On the how many people write about Justin Bieber question, there are not a lot of sites that focus solely on the iPad, as mine does. And very few indeed that do so and are quality sites - the majority are scrapers that just continually ripoff content from sites like mine. Mine is one of the very few sites that covers only the iPad and does so with 100% original content.<p>Could I become an affiliate for Apple? I have no desire to be one. That's not at all what my site is about and it's not at all relevant to this discussion. ""Why should Google allow a site to advertise for Apple products?"" I don't do that at all. I am often critical of Apple, of App Store policies, of iPad related decisions etc. When I post App Store links for apps that I cover, I don't even use the affiliate links that many sites do, I just use straight-up links.<p>Am I really an Apple expert? Yes. And particularly an iPad and iOS expert. Again, I've written for the leading print title (iPhone and iPad Life Magazine) in this space since its debut issue, I've appeared on ABC World News and various radio programs and podcasts as an iPad and iPhone expert, I've been working with mobile devices since back in the days of the Palm Pilot, many leading publishers come to me to beta test and assess pre-release builds of their apps, Robert Scoble lists me among his most influential tech writers. I've also worked in tech support, network management, and IT consulting for over 15 years. So yes, I'm very confident in saying I am an expert on the very tightly focused subject I cover.<p>On the footer links, I honestly didn't even realize what kind of links they were. I have used the Thesis theme for years and Rackspace for hosting for years. I think very highly of both of them, so I was happy having a small link to them. I've made exactly zero dollars via those links. I took them down when I saw it mentioned here that they are not a good idea.",1305389103

I'd have no problem with discussion of climate change and human activity--that's a problem that involves everyone and one which presents opportunities for start-ups, but to persist in beating the ""global warming is not happening"" drum makes no sense here.

Nobody moved into 1, therefore you can put the new arrivals there.<p>After that, there are still (countably) infinite many guests. They are just matched up differently with the rooms/numbers.<p>Because you have infinitely many rooms, you were able to accomodate one more by matching them up differently.

4526338,comment,4526049,4526049,7,0,tikhonj,,,"The idea of different infinities is very important to programmers. In particular, they are the underlying reasons for undecidable problems.<p>You can write any valid computer program as a string of finite length from a finite alphabet. This means the set of programs is countable. (This should not be surprising--everything is ones and zeroes, after all, so you always end up mapping your program to a really large natural number to use it.)<p>EDIT: To clarify a bit--the set of computer programs is <i>infinite</i> and countable. I sometimes use ""countable"" to mean ""countably infinite"" which is a very bad habit. My only justification is that the fact that a finite set is countable is trivial and therefore boring.<p>The number of functions between two countably infinite sets is <i>not</i> countable. This is also fairly easy to see: the set X  Y can be easily mapped to a subset of P(X  Y) where P deontes a powerset. All this says is that you can describe any function from X to Y as a set of ordered pairs (X, Y). For two countable sets X and Y, X  Y is also countable; if either X or Y is infinite, X  Y is also infinite. This means that P(X  Y) is <i>not</i> countable, so X  Y is not countable either.<p>EDIT: My justification for why X  Y is uncountably infinite if either X or Y is countably infinite (and both are countable, of course) is not correct. Just mapping something to a subset of P(X  Y) doesn't actually tell us anything. However, the actual fact <i>is</i> correct even if I don't show it, so I'm going to figure out (or, honestly, probably look up) why this is the case and amend my post further :P.<p>So the number of programs we can write <i>is</i> countable; the number of functions we can write over interesting domains (like natural numbers or integers) <i>is not</i> countable. There has to be an infinite number of functions we cannot write programs for!<p>So we have managed to show, in a fairly simple way, that there have to exist undecidable problems. The real trick is that we can see this <i>without</i> having to construct a problem like that or even reason much about programs in general; all we have to know is that programs are strings and have finite lengths.<p>The other neat bit is that this reasoning is very easy to adapt to proofs rather than programs. After all, mathematical proofs are also finite-length strings! And, for example, propositions about the natural numbers are essentially functions   {true, false}. So you can't prove all of them.<p>So now we also see a deep relationship between proofs and programs, without actually doing much thinking about proofs <i>or</i> programs.<p>We can also see that I'm no mathematician and either made some blatant errors or was not very rigorous throughout :P.",1347724377

4526291,comment,4523611,4526045,1,0,zemo,,,"nonblocking i/o is an important feature if you want to make something responsive that will handle a lot of connections.  node.js brings that to the foreground, and makes it a topic that is digestible for a lot of programmers that have never seen it before.  The end result is that by using node.js, a developer is able to experience one element of concurrency that they may not have had exposure to using Ruby/Python/PHP.  Yes, it is possible to do nonblocking i/o in Ruby/Python/PHP, but it isn't as natural of an experience.<p>It's a usability thing.  If you make something easier to use, more people use it; as a result, node.js has introduced the topic of nonblocking i/o in a way that other technologies have been unable to do.  It also allows you to share code between the client and the server, which may or may not matter, depending on your project.  And for a lot of developers, node.js means using a language you already know.<p>The guys at Kitchen Table Coders do a workshop where they make a physical game paddle with an arduino, and then hook it up to a node.js server, so that two people can play pong with physical controllers in their browser.  They're able to teach that workshop in a day.  I think that speaks volumes for types of things that you can do with node.js, and its mass appeal.<p>But, like I said in the article, I find that node.js becomes disorganized quickly, and I just plain don't enjoy debugging JavaScript.  On top of that, if you need to do CPU-bound work, node.js basically forces you to create an isolated process and perform i/o with it, but now you have an OS process for each of these instances, whereas in Go, creating a goroutine and communicating with it over channels is much more lightweight.

4526252,comment,4522475,4523256,2,0,sophacles,,,"There is such a thing as underemployment, but I don't think it means what the gp and you are claiming. Actually I think that like unemployment, there are 2 forms of it...<p>1. voluntary - a person is capable of doing a job, that job is available and fits into that person's life, but (s)he chooses to work at a less demanding job not utilizing his/her skills. I don't see this as a problem, personal choice is OK.<p>2. involuntary - this is a case where a person or workforce has capacity to produce more, get higher wages, or otherwise  be ""better"" employed, but market <i>inefficencies</i>[1] prevent the best employment. Again, this may not be a problem for the individuals - they may not be bothered by this, but it is a valuable measure for opportunity. If a company can employ these people for $fewer than the going rate, but $more than they are making and gain profit, they should, because it helps overall market efficiency - it helps lower the cost of employees overall, and helps raise the wages of the people who provide value. Everyone wins. Just like finding new sources of any raw material in demand, or using previously ""too expensive"" sources because the market price has shifted.<p>For a real example: company A had a systems office in my town employing some pretty good graybeards. A decided that they didn't want/need to be in that business anymore, and closed the office. For the large part, the graybeards were happy in town, and chose to stay and not work at as well paying jobs, for reasons outside of salary. The thing is - systems graybeards are in demand and expensive (usually). For a while they were underemployed, not making the money they should. But company B heard of this, and realized that they could pay cost-of-living adjusted salaries that saved them a lot of money on a pool of systems people with a proven track record. They opened an office hiring most of the underemployed graybeards and everything was in balance again.<p>Of course that example is almost the text-book ideal case of how efficiencies, indicators, and such should play out. There are harder cases of this. Finding ways to take advantage of the underemployed metric is more difficult.<p>Anyway -- that is the long way around of saying: underemployment may not be a good or even valid measure at a personal level, but at an aggregate level it is a good measure of where efficiency can be sought. Disbelieving it speaks more of personal/political biases than of a market understanding - probably because it is term associated often with jobs programs and other things many dislike.<p>[1] Like algorithms, just because a perfect theoretical algorithm has an efficiency of $X, a given implementation my only be able to achieve $Y efficiency (where $X > $Y).",1347722276

Yes, there are a few shady contractors out there, but there are a lot of things that can happen during design and construction that can increase costs through no fault of our own. For example: change orders. A project gets designed and approved, the contractor gets his contract and starts digging. Two weeks into excavation, the project engineer tells the contractor ""oh, that tunnel needs to be built 20 feet deeper and moved 15 feet to the south."" Why? It could be for any number of reasons, maybe construction uncovered a gas line that couldn't be moved, maybe some politician wanted the line moved further (or closer) to a friend's business, etc. There are also the inevitable lawsuits, environmental issues and so on.<p>One of my big beefs, and one of the factors that IME increases costs for architectural/engineering consultants like me are the hoops we have to jump through to demonstrate that we're not ripping off taxpayers. There are all sorts of audit requirements (including the dreaded DCAA audit), insurance requirements and so on that increase our costs and so we have pass on those costs to the taxpayers. Recently we had an issue when negotiating a contract for transit design project - my firm's is relatively new, and we don't have a revenue history with which to develop audited rates, so we intentionally set out rates low in an attempt to convince accountants that our lack of audited rates wouldn't be a problem. We spent a munch arguing with the prime's accountants who wanted our audited rates to we could demonstrate that our profit on the job wouldn't exceed 10% (they were <i>obsessed</i> with the 10% profit number), depsite the fact that our rates were 40-50% lower than other similar contractors. We had to get someone from the Federal government to step in and tell the prime that our rates were fine as-is.<p>Insurance requirements are the other big issue. General liability isn't so bad, but E&O can be costly for big engineering projects, even if you're exposure is low. However many projects have a ""one size fits all"" with respect to insurance requirements and require everyone to carry $10+ million in general liability and $5+ million in E&O. If you're the general contractor responsible for digging up streets which can have all sorts or negative effects, that's probably reasonable. If you're the graphic designer responsible for creating the signs for the project, that's probably a little excessive.",1347722071

For a single genset. Call it $750M for a 20MW plant running continuously for 20 years. Feel free to factor in a prediction for rising cost of fuel oil. I pay over $9 per US gallon for premium diesel car fuel in the UK...",1347721573

All you ever hear about at election time in the U.S. is ""big government waste."" My colleague from Spain tells me that in Spain everyone goes to work for the government, and that entrepreneurship is lacking. Perhaps that means that in order to have cost-efficient mass-transit projects in the U.S. we need a Spanish-style government and culture.",1347721303

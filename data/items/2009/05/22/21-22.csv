But it will be more accessible than requiring a browser update, or change in browser brands.<p>Browser plugins let people choose their favorite browser brand, without losing functionality to other brands of browser.

I think the reason why most start-ups have customized metrics tracking system is because we are all different.  For a social product, engagement metrics would be much more important.  If you are an utility product, metrics that are more important are probably usability, time spent, effectiveness, or whatever that's relevant to the developers.<p>The metrics I see in that dashboard are just a bunch of numbers that are fun to see, but doesn't give me insights into how I should push my product direction.

After all, who would want to write a macro that breaks just because the user happens to be using a variable of the same name as one used in the macro?</i><p>[Actually, scheme's hygienic macros shift the burden of capture-avoidance to the compiler. It's CL that has to use gensym.]<p>><i>I now understand that all these language features that people work hard to create solve some problem, and it can be a useful and important problem to solve, and yet it can be a problem I don’t care about, a problem I don’t have. That doesn’t necessarily make it a bad language feature, but it can make it one that I don’t want to pay the cost of using.</i><p>[This is fraught with reasoning errors. If you want a language that only has the features you want, create your own DSL. And even after that, you might apply that a la carte reasoning to the runtime and question why you might need a certain garbage collector, if any at all, or why you might need your runtime to have bindings for the OS system calls when you don't use them. Slippery slope. Richness is usually a good thing, not bad.]<p>><i>Yet in Java, it’s hard to get anything shorter than ten or twenty lines of code. See some code duplication, and by the time you’ve written the classes and interfaces and methods you need to write to remove the duplication, the code is just as long as it was before.</i><p>[A personal opinion that will send java programmers in uproar. not that java doesn't suck ;-]<p>><i>Languages written by hackers for hackers like Perl and Ruby and Python are lots better (and, I find for myself, a lot more productive for me for the kinds of projects I work on), and I can write shorter programs in them, yet they don’t help me go further</i><p>[and now the Perl, Python and Ruby programmers feel trolled and will jump at your neck. You requirements are of the DWIM kind.]<p><i>>they don’t help me make my program shorter.</i><p>[Yes, and an Aston Martin can't tow a boat. Right tool for the job]<p><i>>Now I see some pattern in my code, if I’m doing more typing than I want to be doing, BAM I write a macro and use it.

It seems to be most useful for people whose set default MO is to use the same username and password for most of their online accounts; typical users.<p>But OpenID does have its issues.  Obviously trusting one provider with all of your username and password credentials isn't the best idea.  I think, however, that having an OpenID URL is a good idea.  But the better idea is to give new users their own unique ID on your site, and to allow them the option to link it to some other previously established online ID.

The spirit of your essay has been largely positive, IMO, but go easy on the snide remarks and the dismissive attitude of other technologies you have very little experience in (yeah, it shows.) Otherwise a much less sympathetic reader than I, and a far more competent one, will come aboard and tear your argument to pieces.<p>A better way to frame your enthusiastic writing would be ""I can do X in Arc, I really wish ${LISP_DIALECT} would let me do the same"".

622714,comment,622496,622661,0,0,ck113,,,"To make it even more abstruse, it's not usually results that we describe as ""relativizing"", but proofs and proof techniques.<p>For example, the proof technique we call ""diagonalization"" relativizes.  If I prove that complexity class A is contained in complexity class B, what I'm formally proving is that a Turing machine obeying the resource constraints of class B (e.g., polynomial time) can solve any problem that can be solved by a TM obeying the resource constraints of class A (e.g., logarithmic space).  If I prove this by diagonalization, then I've also proved that this inclusion holds even if the Turing machines are granted access to an ""oracle"" that can solve problems that the machines themselves could not solve.<p>Here's an example of where this gets interesting:  it's been proven that there are oracles relative to which P=NP, and other oracles relative to which P != NP.  This means that no relativizing proof (in particular, no proof by diagonalization) can ever resolve the P vs. NP question.  (See why?)<p>So, oracle results don't tell us too much about the actual relationships between complexity classes, but they tell us about what kind of proofs we should and shouldn't bother trying to use to prove those relationships.  It's a sign of just how hard complexity theory is that it's often considered a big achievement just to get an oracle result that tells you that the other proofs you were trying will never solve your problem.<p>If you're <i>really</i> interested, this line of research now goes beyond relativization.  There's another barrier to proving complexity separations called ""Natural Proofs"" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_proof"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_proof</a>), and more recently a third has been proposed called ""Algebrization"", which (far as I can tell) generalizes relativization to the case where we get access not only to oracles but to low-degree polynomial extensions of oracles.  (Unfortunately, if you know what that means, you were probably already aware of the new results.)",1243026087

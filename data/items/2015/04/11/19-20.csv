This is also in part inspired by the comment of humanarity (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9360218"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9360218</a>)<p>Several years ago in The Netherlands we had a website blockade of The PirateBay. Most ISPs had to block it, it was stupid, and it did not work at all. The ISPs were challenging it legally. The question got asked: &quot;How effective is this blockade anyway? Can we measure it?&quot;.<p>I did not realise it at the time, but this was somewhat an identity inflexion point for me, and very much changed my career.<p>As a scientist in computer networking, with some knowledge of Bittorrent, I thought to myself, how hard can it be? I could take some torrents off TPB, record IP addresses passing by and checking which ISP they come from.\nI finished the bittorrent measurements, wrote a report, and tried to publish it. Only the dean and the faculty lawyer got wind of it, and they were not amused, and saw a risk of getting sued by the entertainment industry.<p>I challenged them on this, and noted that I would publish this, even without their support. Fortunately I also got full support of my professor, and we did get to publish it. It was used in the court case, and it helped show the ineffectiveness of the website blockade, so it got lifted.<p>This little weekend project changed my research interests, has made me focus on ethics in computer science research, and especially security research. This has changed much of how I initially planned my career, and it has gotten me to where I am now. I have enjoyed every minute of it, and months later also realised I was not happy with the way my career was going.<p>I took some risk in doing this, but it was something I believed in. The change was possible because I was a researcher at a university, so that made it somewhat easier.",1428782206

9360444,comment,9356433,9357863,0,0,emelski,,,"memoize is certainly not the first use of this technique.  Electric Make (<a href=""http://electric-cloud.com/products/electricaccelerator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://electric-cloud.com/products/electricaccelerator</a>) uses a custom filesystem to track file accesses for purposes of augmenting dependency information, and predates memoize by five years.  It even goes beyond simply tracking accesses to using the information to correct for missing dependencies on the fly.<p>The main problem with strace is not the printing (although that doesn&#x27;t help) but with the ptrace technology underneath, which basically hits the traced process with a SIGSTOP/SIGCONT pair on every system call, as well as a context switch to the tracing process and another back to the traced process.  Even a no-op ptrace-based monitor that does nothing will make individual system calls ~10x slower.  In my benchmarks, the best case overall performance impact was about 5%, but some processes were as much as 560% slower.<p>LD_PRELOAD is faster but has other deficiencies, like it&#x27;s trivially easy to circumvent the tracing by wiping LD_PRELOAD from the environment before starting a new process.  It can also be tricky (though not impossible) to manage implicit state, such as following an application as it first chdir&#x27;s to a new location, then accesses paths like &quot;../../include&quot;.  LD_PRELOAD is also tough to get right in the face of multi-threaded applications.<p>FUSE is interesting but so far I&#x27;ve found the performance to be disappointing.  I think that&#x27;s mostly because it bounces everything through userspace and effectively doubles the filesystem activity for (nearly) everything.  For example, with a normal filesystem a read from a user process basically works like this:<p>user process\n-> read system call\n-> filesystem read operation\n-> return result to user process<p>With a FUSE filesystem it&#x27;s something more like this:<p>user process\n-> read system call\n-> FUSE filesystem read operation\n-> FUSE userspace driver\n-> read system call on real filesystem\n-> filesystem read operation\n-> return result to FUSE userspace driver\n-> relay result to FUSE filesystem\n-> return result to user process<p>There are various caches in place to make this less disastrous than it seems on the surface, but fundamentally this is the architecture.  For some applications that&#x27;s fine; for high-performance build tools I think it&#x27;s probably a deal-breaker.<p>This is why we wrote a custom filesystem for Electric Make, and why that&#x27;s still the approach we take today, nearly 15 years later:  nothing else is as robust, and nothing else comes close to the performance.<p>_Disclaimer: I&#x27;m the architect of Electric Make_",1428781003

Even the amount of CO2 in the air, over the last 600 million years or so, does not correlate well with the amount of carbon sequestered in fossil fuels. If that were true, we would expect to see lots of CO2 before the Carboniferous, very little CO2 from then to now, then a lot now. That is not what we see when we look at the record. See, for example, here:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth%27s_atmosphere#Past_concentration"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth%27s_atm...</a><p><i>> if we dig up an amount of carbon that was buried over 500 million years and we burn it all during a 200 or 300 year time span, then presumably we end up with more carbon in the air, at one time, than ever occurred before</i><p>And if you look up the actual levels of CO2 in the atmosphere over the last 600 million years or so, you will see that this is not even close to being true. CO2 levels have been in the <i>thousands</i> of PPM during the period between the Carboniferous and now, even though all that carbon was buried in fossil fuels. The current epoch is one of very low CO2 concentrations in geologic terms, even counting the recent increase due to our burning fossil fuels.",1428780825

Made a text adventure, self-replicating files etc. I then tried editing an exe file to change it, and realized it wasn't quite that simple. Later on, I found QBASIC and used it to write ""real"" programs, such as little animations and an alarm clock using the PC speaker. I learned some Pascal at school, which is where I found out about flow control structures and functions. Later on, as a teen, I played around a lot with Delphi, finally getting over the disappointment of not being able to edit .exe files that I had as a child. I made a lot of one-off programs I'd put on CDs with autorun as greeting cards and personal messages to friends. I later did a couple of months of VB at school, but didn't learn anything new compared to what I could already di with Delphi. I sneaked into the high school Java classes when I was in 8th grade, and thanks to a particularly tolerant teacher got to unofficially participate. I learned Java and C basics at university classes I took as part of a cooperation agreement between my high school and the local university. Later, officially in university, I took more Java classes and learned what I could of C++ on my own. I was fairly comfortable with C, but C++ was frustrating, because a lot of the complexity felt unnecessary. I stuck with Java for the most part. I wrote C++ and Java at a number of research assistant jobs, and learned bash script and awk on the side for one-off tasks. my first exposure to Python was when a student at a course I was TAing asked if they could submit work in Python. I accepted that, and learned a fair bit from dissecting that program. I didn't touch Python for a while after that. Later, at another job, I did C# one-off programs for psychological experiments. On the side, I was playing around with virtual reality and used Vizard, which is a 3d visualization package built on Python. I started playing around with Python seriously at that point. I now write mostly in Python, except for C and C++ bits for performance-dependent stuff and hardware interfacing (which I use from Python with ctypes.)<p>How long did getting good take? It's hard to say. I feel I've learned something from each of those experiences, and gotten better in the process. I'd say I've gotten to the level where I'm confident in my skills as a programmer within the last couple years, as I've seen meaningful things done with my code.",1267171188

They obviously miscalculated the importance of having a functional app store from the get-go.<p>To their credit, they ramped up pretty fast.  Last September, they hired Ben Galbraith and Dion Almaer (the Bespin guys) to run developer relations.  Ben and Dion immediately restructured the developer program, and Palm had their big developer program rollout in December/January, six months after launch.<p>As of today, the 'App Catalog' is tiny but growing at a pretty good clip.  They're at over 1500 apps right now, and are growing at around 20% a month.  If they can survive another year, they should be up to Blackberry levels.",1267171050

(Most analogies suck.)<p>The only difference between YouTube and Amazon EC2 is flexibility of purpose.  You can do many different things with an EC2 account because it was designed to let you do those things.  You can upload videos to a YouTube account and not much more because YT was designed to do one thing well.<p>What they have in common is that they are both hosting services and apps platforms.  They both host your data and applications.  The fact that the ""window"" into EC2 from the outside is whatever the account holder wants it to be, whereas the window into YT is just YT's interface... is totally irrelevant.<p>The bottom line is that both Amazon and YouTube are hosting your data on their servers, and allowing you to present that data to the public at large.  If one of them is responsible for legality of your content, then both of them must be.",1267168384

So it becomes a race to see who is the first person (who are we kidding here: large company) to reach the USPTO with the right paperwork. Little guys lose. Mind-blowingly dumb.",1267168019

Compared to Plan 9, Unix creaks and clanks and has obvious rust spots, but it gets the job done well enough to hold its position. There is a lesson here for ambitious system architects: the most dangerous enemy of a better solution is an existing codebase that is just good enough.",1267168010

They should have open sourced from the start.<p>Their problem is that unlike other companies, they don't want to give anything back (and this annoys consumers).<p>This strategy works for Apple only because there are many who are heavily biased towards Apple, and Steve Job's often deceives them (like during the iPhone launch, he strongly implied he invented Multitouch, and that no other manufacturer would support multitouch because Apple patented it).<p>Furthermore, nobody even seems to be selling Palm phones here in Australia.

Train travel led to a rapid westward expansion of the United States.  New farms get established, and new towns crop up to serve them, needing homes and markets to be built, a local newspaper, a local grocer, a local bank, eventually local radio and television stations.  Similar basic economic structures get replicated in many diverse geographic locations.  Once one place gets saturated, people move and start up another franchise of the town model.<p>Skipping ahead fifty years or so, the web means I don't have as great a need for the local bookstore, the local newspaper, the local television or radio station, the local bank, etc.  There are plenty of businesses that I still need locally, but they in turn don't have as great a need for the local advertising agency, the local newspaper's classifieds section, the local accountant, the local lawyer, the local travel agent - assuming there's still a local owner, with a local HR department, local management structure, etc.<p>Of the startups you see, how many are going to end up with a business whose operations need to be replicated in many geographic locations?  How many are ever going to be more than an office in the Valley or NYC and maybe a few sales outposts?

Unlike e.g. the tech crash of 2000, 2008 was a crisis of credit, the lifeblood of all other industries.  Their cautiousness in beginning to lend again will make recovery and therefore jobs growth extra long.<p>2. The 2008 crisis forced companies to find new efficiencies.  Whole layers of middle management were eliminated in many cases without any downside and remaining employees were fine working harder to keep their jobs.  Those 'unnecessary' excess positions take a long time to come back.  It will require companies to feel flush and to get lax on this again.<p>3. I think most importantly, our economy largely comes down to consumer spending and the housing bubble didn't just drive inflated housing prices; it also enabled home equity lines of credit to buy boats, etc.  Coupled with loose credit card lending standards, our economy was built upon unsustainable growth in consumer credit.  I don't know when such a consumer credit environment will come back, but again, it will have to be preceded by a sort of boom in the economy.<p>I agree that 'technology efficiency' etc. are not helping, but the heart of it are 1, 2 & 3 above.",1312588236

And that's exactly what's going on with scaling knowledge.<p>I would even argue that the Ruby threading problems he's experiencing may not necessarily because Ruby threads don't scale, but possibly because he's using them wrong or because he's not using the right version of Ruby. Ruby 1.8 uses select() to schedule I/O between threads so the more threads and the more sockets you have, the slower things become because select() is linear time. The use of select() also results in a hard limit of about 1024 file descriptors per Ruby 1.8 process. Also, context switching in Ruby 1.8 requires copying the stack. Ruby 1.9 is much better in this regard since it uses native threads and no longer uses select() to schedule threads that are blocked on I/O. I'm running a multithreaded, multiprocess Ruby (1.8!) analytics daemon that generates 12 GB of data per day. It flies. VMWare CloudFoundry's router is written in Ruby + EventMachine. That thing has to process tons and tons of requests and they've found Ruby + EventMachine to be fast enough. To simply say ""Ruby doesn't scale and is slow"" is too simplistic, and ignoring the underlying more complex reasons would result in one bumping against the same problems in a different context. So no, it isn't so obvious from day 1 that using Ruby would be a problem.",1312587777

In the latter case, the game mechanics should be removed once the difficult first step has been conquered so that the intrinsic motivation can supplant the extrinsic ones, leading to a naturally reinforcing cycle of growth (and flow). If it isn't removed—or if it shouldn't have been there in the first place—then the game mechanics can completely overwhelm the intrinsic motivators.<p>Here we see that learning is intrinsically motivating by itself; no external rewards necessary.

He would become less and less satisfied with a kind of dumb, day-to-day shopwork. His creative intelligence, stifled by too much theory and too many grades in college, would now become reawakened by the boredom of the shop. Thousands of hours of frustrating mechanical problems would have made him more interested in machine design. He would like to design machinery himself. He'd think he could do a better job. He would try modifying a few engines, meet with success, look for more success, but feel blocked because he didn't have the theoretical information. He would discover that when before he felt stupid because of his lack of interest in theoretical information, he'd now find a brand of theoretical information which he'd have a lot of respect for, namely, mechanical engineering.<p>""So he would come back to our degreeless and gradeless school, but with a difference.

He wouldn't need a lot of discipline to shape him up. In fact, if the instructors assigned him were slacking on the job he would be likely to shape them up by asking rude questions. He'd be there to learn something, would be paying to learn something and they'd better come up with it.<p>""Motivation of this sort, once it catches hold, is a ferocious force, and in the gradeless, degreeless institution where our student would find himself, he wouldn't stop with rote engineering information.

And, in the process of intellectual maturing that these abstract studies gave him, he would he likely to branch out into other theoretical areas that weren't directly related to machines but had become a part of a newer larger goal. This larger goal wouldn't be the imitation of education in Universities today, glossed over and concealed by grades and degrees that give the appearance of something happening when, in fact, almost nothing is going on.

Two questions, actually: why doesn't the central bank lend to individuals, and why can't individuals get the same interest rate on loans as a bank.<p>One reason you and I can't get loans at the prime rate (normally in the 2-5% range) is because we don't have the same creditworthiness as a bank.  I don't know about you, but I don't have hundreds of millions of dollars of assets like banks do.<p>(A decade or two ago, when banking was a more boring and staid business, the creditworthiness of a bank was virtually never in question.  In comparison, individuals go bankrupt all time.  Granted, there have been periods of banking abuse-- the S&L scandal, the over-leveraging in the  2000s, etc-- and one can rightly criticize the banks in those contexts.  In fact, lots of people think that banking should return to the lower-risk model of banking, where banks are more deserving of their credit.  But back to your questions.)<p>Why doesn't the Fed lend to individuals?  The Fed's mission is to set fiscal policy.  From \n<a href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/pf/pf.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.federalreserve.gov/pf/pf.htm</a>, ""Goals of Monetary Policy"":<p><i>The goals of monetary policy are spelled out in the Federal Reserve Act, which specifies that the Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market Committee should seek ""to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.""  Stable prices in the long run are a precondition for maximum sustainable output growth and employment as well as moderate long-term interest rates.  When prices are stable and believed likely to remain so, the prices of goods, services, materials, and labor are undistorted by inflation and serve as clearer signals and guides to the efficient allocation of resources and thus contribute to higher standards of living.  Moreover, stable prices foster saving and capital formation, because when the risk of erosion of asset values resulting from inflation - and the need to guard against such losses - are minimized, households are encouraged to save more and businesses are encouraged to invest more.</i><p>So you see, the intent of this modern economic tool, control of the money supply, is to promote stability while maximizing output.  You said:<p><i>If we are going to have such a system whereby the Fed must print money, which means that the money in the system looses value...</i><p>Actually, printing money doesn't necessarily mean that existing money loses value.  The Fed attempts to expand the money supply as the economy grows to <i>maintain</i> the current value of money.  If it the money supply were suddenly static while the economy continued to grow, I believe this would result in a deflationary spiral: the first stage is where the expanding value of the whole economy must be denominated by a fixed pool of money, causing the value of that money to increase-- which sounds nice at first.  But deflation reduces incentives toward spending and lending, and ultimately curbs growth-- which is bad.  So if the size of the economy were fixed, then perhaps a fixed money supply would be desirable.  Fortunately, the global economy, in the long term, is growing; so the money supply must grow as well.  This reaches the limits of my memory of basic macroeconomics from my B.A. in the late 90s.  I'm a programmer; this stuff isn't top of mind, so I'm sure an actual economist could provide better explanations of several of the points above.  But I think it's generally accurate.",1312586681

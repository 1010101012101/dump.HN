129444,comment,128872,129439,0,0,rms,,,"Yeah, I was actually surprised how cheaply I got restaurant food in SF the last time I was there. It wasn't really any more than Pittsburgh and was definitely cheaper than NYC prices. I figured it was somewhat reasonable because there is so much agriculture nearby. I also meticulously picked out restaurants on yelp and ended up at mostly ethnic places.",1204689195

129441,comment,128872,129114,0,0,amohr,,,"Midwestern college town?  Champaign, IL!  I had a place near campus for $230/month with parking.  You can probably live on $600 a month.  Also, tech guys come through here all the time (UIUC cs students are fairly sought-after, especially because they'll work for less than their Cal equivalents) so you'll be in good company.  And they usually bring free pizza; there are a couple weeks a semester around the job fair when the recruiters are hanging out in town that you can live off of free pizza about every other day.  On that note, there's also a bunch of students that you could get to hack part-time if you needed a man-hour boost.  There's tons of really bright students here that will work for peanuts if you pitch it right.<p>The downtown area is reasonably nice and, if you wanted an office, there's a bunch going up right now in the heart of downtown.  If you really need a big city, you can get to chicago in ~2.5 hours.<p>The down side:  if you drive more than 10 miles in any direction, you might start to regret your decision.  Central Illinois is flatter than you might be able to conceive if you're not from the midwest.  There's really just endless fields of crops in every direction outside the city - they say you can see 10 miles in any direction on a clear day, 20 if you stand on a tuna can.  Also, it was in the low 60's 2 days ago... today it snowed about 6 inches with sleet and plenty of wind.  I guess you get what you pay for.",1204688889

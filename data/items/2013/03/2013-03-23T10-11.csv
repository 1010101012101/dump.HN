(I mean, the 'real faults' bit really only applies if you are selling something to a customer who understands the product... but that's really the only kind of selling I do, outside of the ""selling myself"" interview context.)   It's more like dating than you think, though, in that I generally don't want to waste my time with someone who still believes that they will find someone ""perfect""  -  you want a employer or customer or date who has been around the block and knows that everyone has flaws, and you've just gotta pick the flaw you can deal with.   Then you want them to know about your flaws pretty soon after they know about your assets so that you can both cut your losses if a flaw is a dealbreaker.  anything else is wasting time.<p>I mean, you've gotta show the counter-party your assets first, but in sales, that's easier than in dating, at least for me, as most of my sales prospects read about and come to me;  they already think I'm pretty okay, so I can hit them with the ""and here are the problems with my setup"" just about right out the gate.   Come to think of it... the time I've been really successful dating went similarly.<p>>So there's definitely a disparity between the first impression a person can give, even over 5 hour pair programming sessions, and working day after day with them...<p>Yeah.

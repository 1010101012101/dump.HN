I think the complexity ends up benefiting those who have more resources at their disposal and actually acts as a moat to discourage smaller businesses growth or people from starting businesses.<p>The ability to afford lawyers and accountants to play the system for every write off is a big advantage and so if anything the incentives to large companies is to increase complexity of laws and regulation, which I think is why for all the money and lobbying, laws are getting MORE complex, not less.<p>A simple system with minimal regulations, sensible rates, and no &quot;loopholes&quot; would be much preferable to what we have now. Maybe take it a step further and make it a small transaction tax whenever money changes hands instead of an income tax.<p>Make the transaction tax on every financial transaction, from purchasing equipment to buying a sandwich, and keep the rates the same for pretty much everything. Don&#x27;t have stupid exclusions like large purchases of houses, equipment, buildings, or expensive services.<p>All of a sudden write offs and loop holes pretty much go away, you already have the infrastructure to collect transaction taxes via sales taxes and if you levied it on ALL financial transactions it would probably be < 1%.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure it would be too much change to ever make it through government without being ruined, but it&#x27;d probably be better than what we have now.",1405561898

When you receive dividends from shares you own, the tax paid by the company is offset from your own personal income with &quot;franking credits&quot;.<p>So along with a different capital gains framework, the net upshot is that Australian shareholders are quite happy to take dividends, thankyou. Which means companies can focus more on running things at a profit and less on trying to pump up the stock price any way, any how.<p>The downside is that Australia has a higher headline corporate tax rate than a lot of countries.

But when a company becomes successful, the resources available to teams within the company becomes somewhat decoupled from company revenue.  Soon, political skill becomes as important or more important than impacting the company&#x27;s bottom line.<p>Microsoft and Intel alumni in the late 90s used to tell me that they knew managers whose main goal was to grow the headcount under them, in order to grow their own prestige.<p>Today at Google you can see some of this same behavior in its nascency.  Most of the deadweight is outside Engineering teams because its hard to bullshit when you have to deliver a product.  Still, there are peripheral functions like business development, marketing, intellectual property, privacy, policy, etc., where you can always find a few deadbeats that talk slick, but don&#x27;t seem to have much to show for their time except hiring more people and making a few high impact appearances at meetings.

Once that&#x27;s approved by the board, they look at the organization and specific resource allocation.   It&#x27;s not really that linear, though: changing market conditions and surprising opportunities or threats can lead to changes in how much they&#x27;ll invest overall, which can have a big impact on the size of the layoffs.

You can&#x27;t take advantage of the numerous libraries and references created by the community like you can with Ruby, Python, Javascript, Java, or any of the other mainstream languages.<p>You&#x27;d be surprised how good the community is around FP languages.<p>> OCaml is hard (and so are most functional programming languages)<p>I&#x27;m going to strongly disagree on this one. FP is <i>different</i> to what you&#x27;re used to. Once you&#x27;ve learned it I actually think FP is substantially easier, especially when maintaining large codebases. The amount of cognitive effort required to write code in an FP style is substantially lower.<p>> You will always need exceptionally talented developers to work on your code base and that will get expensive<p>I work with Scala, not OCaml personally, but I&#x27;ve been able to train Junior Java devs up on Scala (In a pure-fp style) with minimal effort. In addition, I find there&#x27;s a very large talent pool of excellent developers wanting to work with FP in a commercial environment, and are willing to work for <i>less</i> for the opportunity.<p>Hiring has actually been substantially easier since I switched to Scala, and I&#x27;m getting better developers for less.<p>> OCaml is a risk. If you&#x27;re starting a consumer-oriented service, you need to prove there is a market for it. Will OCaml help you get to market faster? I don&#x27;t know. Will Ruby-on-Rails? Yes.

From my experience with FP Scala, the go to market time has been substantially quicker than with any other platform I&#x27;d used previously. The defect rate has been 90%(!) lower, productivity is higher, the codebase is easier to work on, an it&#x27;s easier to find top-tier developers.<p>Mind you I can understand not wanting to bet the farm on it from day one - this is why Scala was an easier choice for us, because we could fall back to Java if we have problems (We didn&#x27;t).",1405560149

8045522,comment,8045189,8045189,8,0,rayiner,,,"This is an excellent article. The key takeaway starts here:<p>> I know what you’re thinking. You want a simple tax code that raises a bunch of money by closing the loopholes. Many people think this because they think that taxing income is simple, so “loopholes” must be illicit backdoors placed in the tax code at the behest of greedy corporations.<p>> And to be sure, the tax code contains plenty of senseless giveaways to corporations. But these are small beer. Most of the “loopholes” that we argue about are not a result of congressional pandering, or even sharp lawyers who bend sensible rules. They’re an artifact of the fact that calculating corporate income is really hard.<p>I realized this when I was taking an introductory course in federal income tax, and trying to figure out the effect of different depreciation schedules. There&#x27;s a neat logic to the income tax, including complex concepts like depreciation.[1] Yet, things that are simple to state as an equation are quite complex to implement in practice. For example, things like loss carry-forwards arise from trying to tax a continuous parameter (changes in wealth over time), in discrete, annual time-steps.<p>I disagree with people who think corporate taxes are &quot;double taxation&quot; or anything like that. Taxing corporations falls naturally out of treating them as distinct legal persons. A corporation&#x27;s income is treated, and taxed, distinctly from shareholders&#x27; income for the same reason a corporations legal liabilities are treated distinctly from shareholders&#x27; liabilities. It&#x27;s just the flip side of the coin.<p>That said, while corporate make sense within the logic of the tax code, in practice they are probably more trouble than they are worth, and create bad incentives for companies to relocate their operations out of the U.S.<p>[1] I recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Chirelsteins-Federal-Income-Taxation-Students/dp/1587783800"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Chirelsteins-Federal-Income-Taxation-S...</a> for a very approachable introduction to the topic.

To avoid taking a final exam he wasn’t prepared for, Kim hit up on the idea of sending in a fake bomb threat. То cover his tracks, he used Tor, supposedly the best anonymity service the web had to offer. But it did little mask his identity from a determined Uncle Sam. A joint investigation, which involved the FBI, the Secret Service and local police, was able to track the fake bomb threat right back to Kim — in less than 24 hours.</i><p>This was a pretty interesting, and amusing incident...but to use it as circumstantial evidence to how Tor might be out-and-out compromised?

Now imagine you had the task of explaining the Internet to someone who had never used it and knew none of its details...how hard would it be to describe a comprehensive history of the Internet, since the 1980s, that made it sound like the Internet was most definitely intended since conception as a vehicle for state surveillance?<p>(...ok, that it has nearly become so is besides the point, I&#x27;m referring to intent from its humble origins)",1405559518

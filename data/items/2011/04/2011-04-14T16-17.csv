Positive and negative qualities are both useful (but neutral is meh, don't bother).<p>2. Ranking your qualities would be very helpful but optional. (1. helpful, 2. organized, 3. etc...)<p>3. Explaining your choices is appreciated (and will keep things interesting).<p>4. Everyone doesn't need to agree, in fact, I am more interested in the differences for my analysis (variety is good).<p>5. Bonus points for meta comments that have the qualities they list. (meta)<p>I'll tally up votes for comments too but it'll have to wait till pg reverts the system back or passes along the data some other way. Hopefully this data will be useful for making HN even better.<p>Thanks for everyone's help!",1302800370

That's all evolution is. Biological evolution happens with every generation - hours in bacteria, decades with humans. And since we're reproducing asynchronously, it's happening second by second across the population.<p>This is important to understand. Evolution does NOT operate on scales of thousands or millions of years. It can not, because there are no reproduction-variation-selection operations working on that timescale in biology (that I know about). There may be large time spans between what look like interesting things - speciations, the advent of birds, etc. But this is just in the mind of the observer.<p>Consider that the bacteria that cause infectious disease are becoming resistant to the antibiotics we've had for only a few decades.

Please take into account that in all but most extreme climates, most of the raw calories in a hunter-gatherer group comes from the <i>gathering</i> part, which is mostly a female activity. The problem with a pure gathering diet is that it tends to be protein and fat deficient, so one strategic contribution of the male hunters is not to keep the bellies full, but the diet balanced. Neolithic farmers discovered the hard way that a belly full of grains still leads you to malnutrition.<p>The other big strategic contribution of male hunters to their communities is protection. The only way a bunch slow moving, child bearing women can wander safely in the wilderness gathering food and wood is to bring a couple of armed men along. This men were probably too old or too young to join the hunters, but would provide a valuable service in protecting their people of predators (human or otherwise).<p>Not to imply that women are unable to defend themselves... but Nature does not care about political correctness.

Reason is simple: you need PLL anyway to generate lot of different clock signals, so you can as well use cheapest xtal you can found, and that usually happens to be something that is used in lots of mass-market NTSC equipment.

I have actually done this and they did not care what OS I had on my computer (other than the first level support asking me to run a defragger). In either case, if something else broke, I could always get the stock Windows back on there.<p>Why can't this apply to phones? Give me a tool (for all OS's, not just Windows), that can reflash my phone back to stock (I realize these exist, but I gather they are leaked and not official binaries, no source). Then give me the ability to unlock the bootloader through whatever means (e.g.: a text message, etc). Then allow me to <i>work on my own damn device</i>. If I break it I have a way to flash back. The warranty should only cover the hardware and the software should be re-flashable at any point.

The 'grow them like you grow teeth' is meant to indicate that, given certain inputs/environment, a child will develop normal language function. You don't need to 'learn' it in the sense that you <i>do</i> need to learn e.g. how to read. The reason for the contrast (argues a linguist) is that we have some internal cognitive structures that react to certain kinds of input, namely linguistic input, and that that reaction is called 'learning your first language(s)'. They disagree with the 'common sense' approach, that learning your first language is just like learning anything else.<p>I would characterize the debate between linguists and a certain class of cognitive scientists like this:<p>CogSci: Hey, you keep talking about UG/Innate mechanisms! We don't like that/it seems implausible. Instead, we should just have general learning algorithms that can be utilized to learn language!<p>Ling: Cool! Show us! Show us!<p>CogSci: Well...Here's a machine learning model that can learn English past tense with the following training data.<p>Ling: Oh. Um. Hmmm. Yeah, the data is more complex than that. How far can you get with <i>this</i> data (unloads data by the truckful). Also: that looks like how adults learn things (the kinds of errors made), not really how kids learn language (they make different kinds of errors). Can you model that?<p>CogSci: It's a simple model! It can't handle that data. That's for a later paper! Also, we don't care about the error classifications, as long as it looks like learning.<p>Ling: Ok. Let us know when that paper comes out. Have you seen this Bantu data? It's pretty cool too.<p>CogSci: <i>later</i>: Ok, look. We didn't get the model to work, but we really think your multiplying entities. I mean, it's just crazy/biologically-implausible/ugly to postulate this innate knowledge.<p>Ling: Yup. But here's the deal. We can't manage to actually explain everything we want even if we postulate innate rules/knowledge like <i>crazy</i>. Maybe we have a fundamentally broken model. Maybe machine learning really will come and eat our babies (or maybe the kinds of things we're postulating will turn out to built on top of machine learning, as explanations at different levels). But so far, it's the best we've got.<p>Obviously, people write books on these arguments, so some massive simplification was done here.

Emacs runs well (and is quite usable with Prompt's modifier key placement, unlike in other iOS ssh clients I'd tried;  remember, folks, ESC is Meta, Meta is ESC).  touchTerm had some screen lag/partial refresh issues for me with Emacs -- these may have been fixed in later versions, though, as I gave up at some point.<p>In short, I like it.<p>obDisclaimer:  I don't know the developers.

Our rate (there were two of us) was $50/hour discounted to $45 after negotiations (they guaranteed X hours a month).<p>At the time, I had little experience (though I could do the work) virtually no portfolio or anything, and it was a struggle to find new work.  I eventually went to work directly for this company full time, hired at 55k+ and renegotiated to 70k+ after 6 months.<p>I am leaving the company basically because I want to have my own free time, etc and am now in a position where I will be able to get plenty of work.  They are having a hard time filling my position with someone with my skills, etc.<p>I have informally agreed to work with them as a contractor over the summer to help train the new developer on our system, be an emergency backup, etc.<p>I have a very good relationship with this company, both as an employee and just friendships within the company.<p>They are a medium level of SOL if I just walk and don't give them work/help, but I don't want to leverage that at all, or at least minimize them feeling like I am squeezing them for all they are worth.<p>Does anyone have some pointers here on how to go about this?  Both keeping things as amiable as possible and maximizing my rate.",1302796833

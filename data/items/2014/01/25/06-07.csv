7120106,comment,7114913,7119572,5,0,pdonis,,,"<i>it&#x27;s impossible to approach the edge of the universe too, despite that border having a physical location.</i><p>No, it doesn&#x27;t. There is no edge to the universe. Our best current model is that the universe is spatially finite, but even if it turns out to be spatially finite, it is unbounded--the spatially finite model is a 3-sphere; like the surface of the Earth but with one more dimension. The surface of the Earth is finite, but it has no edge; a spatially finite universe would be the same way but with one more dimension.<p><i>Seen from the outside it is infinite.</i><p>No, it isn&#x27;t. Seen from the outside, the hole has a finite mass in a finite volume, so its density is finite. (The finite volume an outside observer would assign, based on the surface area of the hole&#x27;s horizon, is not the &quot;actual&quot; volume of the hole; but it works well enough as an &quot;effective volume&quot;, the volume that the hole occupies from the standpoint of the rest of the universe.)

I would like to share a example with you and discuss it so we define the perfect usecase and maybe one day even the perfect helpdesk.<p>Since I believe every story like this should start from the end, let&#x27;s assume that at the end we want the system to send satisfaction questionnaire to the issue Reporter.\nBefore, the solver of the issue would mark the issue as fixed (or completed) in his favourite to-do list and add some comments about what was wrong and how it was fixed. Still in his favourite to-do list, maybe on his phone or inside Microsoft Outlook.<p>How would he know there is an issue assigned to him? Not only was the task added to his to-do list (ToDolst, Outlook, whatever) put also his calendar (again it is up to the user) received an event carefully planned to his next free slot so he would notice. The event as well as the task would also include other valuable information about what needs to be Fixed, where to find it etc.<p>But the issue needs to be assigned, right? There is where the dispatcher is reading the queue of all the requests coming from different channels like web, email, twitter Facebook or by phone through callcenter. She just categorize. Based on the different skills the solvers have, the issues could be automatically pre-assigned and she just confirms.<p>And that is it. Of course the helpdesk also needs to issue invoices, have a lot of reports and so on, but the basic use case could be like this. What do you think? Would you like to report to the system? Would you like to be solving tickets in it?",1390632612
7120102,comment,7119674,7119674,64,0,ifktaotc,,,"A few years ago I got testicular cancer.  The information about the disease came in pieces: first all I knew was that there was a lump; then came the ultrasound, the CT scan, then biopsy of the testicle, then a second surgery to sample lymph nodes to which the cancer might have spread.  At every step I would obsessively query my doctors for conditional probabilities: given what we&#x27;d just found out, what were the chances of dying?  Of relapse?  Of chemo?  Of sterility?  I was always incredibly frustrated at how vague their responses would be - they&#x27;d say, e.g. &quot;we don&#x27;t like to give probabilities because you just never know what will happen!&quot;.  And I would think, &quot;That&#x27;s exactly the point of a probability!  Please just tell me a number!&quot;<p>One doctor eventually showed me a paper on outcomes for the lymph node surgery I had, with a relapse rate curve going out five years so.  I found this incredibly helpful for managing my emotions because it let me track my progress in a very precise way: every monthly checkup that would go by uneventfully, I knew exactly what my chance of relapse had dropped to.  The goal was to get to zero.  More importantly, having actual numbers gave me something on which I could focus my optimism.  It&#x27;s so much worse to hear &quot;you might become sterile&quot; than &quot;there&#x27;s a 5% chance of becoming sterile&quot;.  With the 5% number in mind, I&#x27;d do things like imagine myself in a room full of 20 people and think &quot;wow, it would be incredibly unlikely to be randomly chosen from this group&quot;.  Having spent a lot of time in a cancer hospital now -- around people who were much worse off than I was -- I believe that almost everyone has incredible reserves of optimism.  I think it&#x27;s better when the hopeful possibility is concretely defined - it makes it easier to imagine a path forward while you&#x27;re stuck waiting for more information.<p>Mine is obviously a completely different situation from the terminal cancer described by the author, where the question isn&#x27;t, &quot;when will I be free of this cancer&quot;, but rather &quot;when will I die from it&quot;.  Testicular cancer is very treatable, and I never faced a significant chance of death.  I&#x27;m sure I would have been in a much different psychological state if I had.<p>Also, PSA: testicular cancer is REALLY common for young males (if you&#x27;re male you have a 1 in 500 chance of getting it between 20 and 34).  Given HN user demographics, there are almost certainly some of you reading this who&#x27;ve gotten it already, or who will.  You can save yourself a ton of trouble if you do a self-examination every once in a while.  That&#x27;s actually how I found out, and is a big reason that I avoided chemotherapy.",1390632541

7120086,comment,7114913,7119162,1,0,VladRussian2,,,"the event horizon - Schwarzschild radius - is defined by the specific value of gravitational potential (escape speed equals speed of light) while, given the black hole mass large enough, the gravitational force at the Schwarzschild radius can be as small as we&#x27;d like it to be. The various local effects like time dilation, light path curving, etc... are defined by the value of gravitation force, not gravitational potential. The potential defines the fact that anything originating at or below the horizon would never escape completely the gravitational field, i.e. never reach the infinity.<p>The Schwarzschild radius of the mass of the observable Universe is 10B light years. So, several billions years ago, when observable Universe had 10B radius, it would be a black hole (though i think that in less expanded space of the earlier Universe the constants like &quot;c&quot; had different values and thus that Schwarzschild radius was less). We can imagine it in another way - increase 125 times (the observable Universe has 40+B light years radius) the amount of matter, ie. galaxies, stars, etc... inside the 10B radius ball around us, and you&#x27;d get the black hole with 10B light years Schwarzschild radius (and i don&#x27;t think we would ever notice the change - only with time the galaxies&#x27;s movement will be affected). Obviously, the gravitational field on the surface of that imaginary 10B radius sphere and inside it would increase somewhat (like 125 times on the surface, 125 times 0 pretty much 0) -  not even close though to any values to affect space curvature or to prevent anything from crossing it from inside.

I am a coder who works in a variety of languages build on many paradigms, of which SQL is one of my most enjoyable. I agree that the creation of schemas can be painful, but SQL&#x27;s almost Prolog level of declaration can be beautiful in certain problem spaces. It is unfortunate that the current state of query optimizers leads to leaky abstractions where one must rearrange queries to allow for efficient execution. Still, I have had a great deal of success introducing SQL to otherwise nontechnical people, and they also love the fact that one can describe the solution you desire as opposed to instructing the computer on how to get there. These people particularly benefit from the almost English nature of the language, and I feel I have no right to complain about any syntax with a `use Perl;&#x27; background on my desktop.",1390630006

The ability to form an &quot;in-group&quot; and commit to doing what is in the interests of this group (thus solving the free-rider problem) is an essential social skill.<p>However, when groups professionalize in the sense of restricting the supply of people to that job, they are benefiting their own in-group at the expense of society as a whole (customers, employees and shareholders, people excluded from the profession, and indirectly, everyone else).  Tech workers intuitively recognize this, and professionalization is the antithesis of hacker culture.  In fact, I would say that professionalization wouldn&#x27;t actually help the nerdy people you are referring to.  It would just bring in different people (of course the social justice movement is already working hard to eliminate hacker/nerd culture from the tech industry).<p>As this article shows, tech workers are fighting this issue through the legal system.  Maybe a union will be needed just to deal with this issue.  I suspect that the rivalry between Google and Facebook, and the fear of further lawsuits, will keep competition rigorous in the short term.",1390629653

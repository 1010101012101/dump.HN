I know there is an amazing amount of experience and intellect here.\n4 years ago, I applied to Stanford as a direct result of reading (here) about getting out of our comfort zones. I was living in a Bureau of Indian Affairs dormitory for high school students when I got the news that I was accepted. This was a huge deal, because statistically I am part of a demographic the comprises the bottom 1% of the income spectrum here in America.\nBut I left Stanford after a year, partly because it was such a huge change, but also because I wanted see if I could succeed on reservation I grew up in (the Navajo Nation). I&#x27;m now 22, and I can say I used what little I had to try to make a difference.\nI&#x27;ve made mistakes - one of which was lying to my peers about leaving because I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the change that Stanford demanded. Another was not asking for help when I needed to. And, finally, I didn&#x27;t pursue a regular job when my family demanded it. And now, I don&#x27;t know what to do.\nI have about $20K in debt - student loans that have already been deferred, money I used to buy a computer (pretty much the only thing I own), and medical bills from a year of battling cancer. And, as of today, I had to get out of my step-parent&#x27;s house because it was not a good place for me to be anymore.\nI am at a park in the next town over - a town that tends to be particularly disdainful of Native Americans wandering the streets. I don&#x27;t know what I am looking for here on HN. It&#x27;s always been a source of encouragement to me, especially in those times that I felt the most uncomfortable or hopeless.

As a rule, American residential construction is prefab housing; the exterior walls are chipboard with (usually) wood siding, sometimes brick veneer, the interior dividing walls are sheetrock.  Floors are wooden, too, a soundproofing layer between the floorboards and joists is not standard.  You could not get brick construction if you wanted to.  Not too far from my apartment is a well-to-do part of town.  Someone is building a new house next to the golf course there, and the half million dollars that that fellow paid for his new pile still gets him nothing better than chipboard and sheetrock.

For one thing, automobiles were invented after alcohol but before breathalyzers, and we got along more or less just fine without having to put a bunch of people in jail for having alcohol. I see no reason why legal marijuana use would be much different.<p>Additionally, it&#x27;s self-evidently not &quot;all about safety&quot;. That&#x27;s insane. If so, why let anyone drive at all? That&#x27;s another option - there&#x27;s no test for if you are driving tired, but that provides similar levels of driving impairment to alcohol, plus there&#x27;s already quite a bit of illegal use of marijuana. If we ban all driving, no one can kill each other with cars, problem solved, and there are no safety implications here, because driving is not critical to your safety. Police, ambulances and firefighters can still use their vehicles, because safety is the only thing that is important.",1406435335

In Shanghai, for example, one large pork processor has no refrigeration system; instead, it does all its slaughtering at night, when the temperature is slightly cooler, in a massive shed with open sides to allow for a cross breeze. The freshly disemboweled pigs hang for hours in the smoggy air.<p>...on average, a Chinese person experiences some kind of digestive upset twice a week — a kind of low-level recurring food poisoning, much of which is probably caused by the kind of bacterial growth that could have been prevented by keeping food cold<p>Nearly half of everything that is grown in China rots before it even reaches the retail market.<p>...generating the power (whether it be electricity for warehouses or diesel fuel for trucks) that fuels the heat-exchange process, which is at the heart of any cooling system, accounts for about 80 percent of refrigeration’s global-warming impact (measured in tons of CO2) and currently consumes nearly a sixth of global electricity usage<p>...refrigeration in the United States has tended to merely change when the waste occurs. Americans, too, throw away 40 percent of their food, but nearly half of that waste occurs at the consumer level, meaning in retail locations and at home. “Food waste is a justification for refrigeration,”<p>...as for most Americans, Bloom says, home refrigerators simply “serve as cleaner, colder trash bins.”<p>“When I first lived in China, in 1994,” she said, “everything was dried, pickled or salted.<p>...optimizing the varieties of popular Chinese greens that stand up best to cold storage. If they are successful, the incredible regional variety and specificity of Chinese fruits and vegetables may soon resemble the homogeneous American produce aisle, which is often limited to three tomato varieties and five types of apple for sale, all hardy (and flavorless) enough to endure lengthy journeys and storage under refrigeration.<p>And the hero of the mattter:<p>&quot;Still, not all Chinese people are ready to embrace the refrigeration revolution. Dai Jianjun is the 45-year-old chain-smoking chef of Longjin Caotan, a restaurant on the outskirts of Hangzhou, the scenic capital of Zhejiang province, which serves an entirely locally sourced, anti-industrial cuisine. When I asked him how he liked frozen dumplings, he took off his corduroy cap, rubbed his shaved head with both hands and finally, in a calm voice that carried a distinct undercurrent of anger, said, “If I may speak without reserve, they’re not food.”&quot;",1406434027

You can add as many parenthesis as you want.  The &quot;exit&quot; is there because you&#x27;ll get a syntax error if you try to execute g()()(&#x27;al&#x27;).  g()(&#x27;al&#x27;) by itself does nothing (I&#x27;m not even sure why it&#x27;s not flagged as a syntax error).",1406434016

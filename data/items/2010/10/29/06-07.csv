1846428,story,,,2,0,girlyboy,"Your Fingers Know When You Make a Typo",http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/10/fingers-know-typos/,"The brain uses two different checks to guard against sloppy copy, a new study finds. By using a doctored word processor to sneak errors into typed words and surreptitiously fix typists’ real errors, researchers teased apart the various ways people catch their own mistakes. The study, published in the Oct. 29 Science, highlights the complexity of performance monitoring.<p>sciencenewsPsychologist Gordon Logan and his colleague Matthew Crump of Vanderbilt University in Nashville recruited skilled typists — people who typed more than 40 words a minute using all of their fingers. These subjects were able to type a paragraph about the merits of border collies with over 90 percent accuracy.<p>As the typists pecked away, researchers introduced common typing errors into about 6 percent of the words that appeared on a screen (changing sweat to swaet, swerat or swet, for instance). The program also corrected about 45 percent of the typists’ true errors.<p>In questionnaires after the typing test, subjects by and large took the blame for the introduced errors and took credit for the researchers’ corrections. No matter what he actually typed, when the typist saw that the word on the screen matched the word he had intended to type, he assessed his own performance as accurate.<p>But the speed of the typists’ keystrokes revealed something else. After hitting the wrong key, a typist’s fingers slowed down for the next keystroke, even if the researchers sneakily fixed the error so that the typist didn’t notice it. In these cases, a typist wasn’t explicitly aware of the mistake, but the brain’s motor signal changed nevertheless.<p>Logan says that this change in timing reflects a kind of automatic assessment of performance. “The body is doing one thing and the mind is doing another,” he says. “What we found was that the fingers knew the truth.”<p>Many psychologists thought that the mind was capable of detecting errors in several ways, but “nobody had pinned it down,” says cognitive neuroscientist Jonathan Cohen of Princeton University. “Here, they developed a very clever set of experiments to tease the types of system apart.”<p>The results may reveal a hierarchical method of error correction — with a “lower” system doing the actual work and a “higher” system assigning credit and blame, Logan suggests. These multiple layers of control may be evident in tasks such as playing music, speaking and walking to a destination, Logan says. As a man heads toward a new restaurant, his brain is noticing landmarks and keeping on the right course. Meanwhile, his feet steadily plod along, navigating the terrain automatically.<p>Whether the two types of error-catching systems operate in tandem or one is subservient to the other isn’t yet clear, Cohen says. Having the automatic, fingers-level system answer to the higher system “has a sort of intuitive appeal,” Cohen says, “but whether that idea is a convenience until we have a better idea or it’s true remains to be seen.””<p>Read More http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/10/fingers-know-typos/#ixzz13jCsFyFf",1288335236

You can refractor the system a hundred different ways and completely change implementation if you like (or even start using a completely different programming language) and as long as the BDD tests continue to pass, you know you have NOT changed the features and behavior of your system. You know, 100%, that you have not broken the system as a whole.<p>With regard to 1 and 2:<p>1) Every product owner is different. Some do like to write down what they want. Some don't.

1846413,story,,,2,0,manuelmuyot,"Get Involved with IT",,"Since the dawn of man, there was technology; the knowledge of how to use the tools, the techniques, the system, the methods and the procedures, they were all present since the beginning. We may not know it but even cavemen were as their definition of smart as they can be. Using rocks and stones to get things done were as far the best tool they could find!<p>As we evolved, we started getting smarter and smarter, thus we used those silly old sticks and stones and made the axe. Yes, we were starting to get the hang of using the axe and other tools that our great, great ancestors made, but change wasn’t far behind, we always wanted something more! From the Stone Age, we moved on to the industrial age; the age where the people used other people to get things done in the factories. We were by as any definition of slave workers, but notice that even in the midst of all these negativity and smog (Yes, global warming was already knocking at out door that early), the evolution of technology has improved by more than ten folds! Weak materials were no longer a factor for we found out that we can also use metal in exchange for other materials like wood.<p>We were doing so good, but then as the military were experimenting on what others called the computer (Hello ENIAC!). They discovered that machines and people were being used too much that it occupied space and much effort, we wanted something better. We got the idea of ENIAC and developed it to what we are now using, computers. Finally, we have entered the Computer Age, wherein everyone instead of playing in the field outside laughing and enjoying the sun, are now stuck at home using their computers for work or leisure. I remembered where before when I was about 5, playing car meant extending your arms like you were holding a wheel and creating engine sounds (vroom!), now when you say playing car, it is the super pixilated version of Test Drive (fun times!).<p>All the machines that were controlled by people and their silly clipboards are now using these big devices called computers where it would measure up to about 30 clipboards combined. It is a wonder when you think about it, why people would exchange clipboards and pens to computers. They didn’t even know if it was such a good idea; exchanging clipboards to computers, for the computer stage was still experimental. For those that didn’t change their crappy clipboards with papers that easily get destroyed when hit with water and their oh so ever ball pen that never lets them down, unless they start to blot then in that case, scratch what I said; boo for you, the chance to change their system was already there but they didn’t do it, so together they slowly fell like the finite words in the dictionary.<p>The computer age was a hit to the market like MC Hammer’s song “You can’t touch this” except it didn’t fall the next week. Offices started changing their system to computerized ones because based from feedback they can increase your performance. Now when you enter work and sit down in your chair and listen carefully, you could hear people aggressively hitting their keyboards going “tick” (At least the sound wasn’t that noisy compared to the typewriter). Because of the computer, companies started advancing to better and more proficient solutions and services. But because of the upgrade, they wanted to connect from all over the world, good thing they were already doing experiments on that, they called it internet. People could now start using the internet to transfer information online. As it grew, they made the WWW or the World Wide Web, we could now start hosting information in the web and other people with the right permission could access it. The WWW becoming the world’s biggest library really helped kids a lot in their home works, thanks to them kids became so lazy that they didn’t even need to go to the library to find answers; they would just go to their computer, access the internet, and start searching about their topic.<p>The internet was such a hit that picking up people in a bar was almost discarded in the playbook, thanks to online dating. Almost every thing that could be put in the internet for easier access was put. Because of the internet, the percentage of couch potato’s increased. Yes, people were starting to get addicted to the internet, posting information about themselves hoping to find new friends. The words Facebook, Friendster or MySpace may come to mind, that’s the side of the people that didn’t really care how all these were made. As for the developers, they were getting so innovated that you could track anyone from any part of the world in a click. Processes that were once done by meeting the client in person was now exchanged to online systems that only require you to log on then you can do the process.<p>When people realized that a good paying job could be done at home with the help of the internet, developers started making codes simpler for normal people to understand; API’s for those that are coders but still can’t understand the code. Getting involved with IT or Information Technology is now as easy as walking. You may have a bit of a hard time at first but with time and a little help, you can become an expert (or seem like an expert). Hosting websites were now in our reach, sometimes even for free. For those that continue to explore the wonder of IT and get better at it may get a job in a company. They say nowadays that whoever has the best IT, is ahead of the competition.<p>As an Information Systems student, I realized that in our faculty, there are basically three types of IT people; those that are hardcore programmers, those that love to document the paper work, and those that re-use other peoples work but develop on it to make it better. See that last one? Anyone can get in that field, all you need is a little knowledge of IT and you can be considered an IT person.<p>From the start of man, to the present, technology in many forms has been there to help us make our lives easier. Now in the IT age, getting involved with IT seems like it isn’t really a bad idea, and it could be done easily. So why not get involved with IT? Who knows, you might be the one that gives another milestone after the computer age.",1288334599

I was educated for two years in Taiwan (my dad's company forced us to move, I was the white-washed Asian). Those brutal memories: I had to stay after school and take remedial work in the Chinese brush because I was barely literate, and every time my stroke was wrong the teacher would slam the brush against my fingers. We had to memorize poetry from Tang dynasty. If you missed even one character, you would miss the entire thing. No sissy partial credit.<p>When I tutored international students from Asia, the largest hurdle was to get them out of this box thinking. They wanted to be told how to write an essay, and they were asking me which side to take because they wanted to agree with the teacher. I said that was your job, that is what the teacher is testing you.<p>Except, when I read drafts of the essay, it read like a poorly plagiarized text of the history book. I said, you have no argument. You need to take a side. They blamed language difficulties, and I said, even if this were written in Chinese, you have no argument.<p>The main thing is that Asian countries value system and structure, and view that we stand on shoulders of giants. The problem, though, is they're highly trained and would out beat most US students on the SATs.

If you write raw SQL, there will be different queries that do similar things all over the place, unless you collect them into a wrapper class of some sort. At which point, you laid the foundations of your DIY ORM.<p>It is less efficient than hand-optimised SQL in most cases, but on the up side, ORMs often make the application development easier and faster, which, in my opinion, is a good trade off.<p>To name an example... Lets say I have a table of Authors, and another with Books, and I want to retrieve a list of books by a particular author, and display that in a template.<p>Without an ORM, I'd write the SQL, stuff the results into some variable the template can then process, and display it. With an ORM, I the query and stuffing into a variable part is done by the ORM. I get back a result object with clearly defined properties, which is easy to display.<p>In SQL, I'd do a 'SELECT * FROM Books WHERE author_id = (SELECT id FROM Authors WHERE name = ""Famous Guy"")', and stuff the results into a simple table, on which the template can iterate over.<p>In - say - Django ORM, that'd be:<p>books_by_author = Book.objects.filter (author__name = 'Famous Guy')<p>Simpler, isn't it?<p>And once you want to add pagination, displaying 10 results per page, you will have to tweak your SQL to add LIMIT support. With - again, with Django - a good ORM, which does lazy evaluation, you can just do:<p>books = Books.objects.filter (author__name = 'Famous Guy')[0:10]<p>Or something similar, and it will Do The Right Thing.<p>This is why I love ORMs, they already implemented all the neat tricks I want.",1288333652

Two thirds of your comment is spot on and pretty much exactly what I came here to say. When I initially viewed your comment it had been down voted and I debated whether or not I should vote it back up. But there are some glaring unfairnesses in your assessment that make me take pause.<p>Suggesting that Hong Kong is the freest state in the region is kind of ridiculous when you compare it to japan or taiwan (post martial law). Last time I had looked (3 or 4 years ago) both were higher on the UN Human Freedom Index (unfortunately I couldn't find a list online).  Also I wouldn't agree that Hong Kong should be held up as an example of a start up state.  I love Hong Kong, it is definitely one of the greatest cities in the world. But it produces very little in the way of innovation outside of finance. There isn't a booming start up community in Hong Kong for the same reason there isn't one in Singapore.  Because to do business on any worthwhile scale, you have to know which wheels to grease and know the right people to grease them.  There was a really great article on this a while ago about why a key reason there weren't any Walmart types in Hong Kong was because it was more profitable to the Triads to keep all the mom and pop shops in business than to work with larger corporations (unfortunately I can't seem to Google anything).<p>But honestly, those points aren't really what bothered me about your comment as to some extent they are based on perception.  What was more perplexing to me was the assertion that Confucianism played a key role in the lack of democracy in Singapore.  Certainly Confucianism has played a key role in shaping Singaporean society, but no more than it has in Hong Kong, and almost certainly to a lesser extent than it has in Taiwan.  One would be hard pressed to find a nation with a large Chinese population in the subcontinent that doesn't have strong Confucian influences.<p>Ultimately Hong Kong and Singapore ( and more and more Taipei) are basically the same cities filling the same roles for different populations.  The only real difference is Hong Kong is a much more fun city to live in.  I agree that Singapore has a glaring issue in the freedoms they allow their people, but really there are a lot of country that do a lot of business that have similar problems (as an American I wouldn't exclude China or the US from that list).",1288332433

The effects of the hormones cannot possibly be worse than just not having sex since you always have the option to not have sex or always use condoms.

For an internet company, software development is going to be a major component, although there are others, like design.<p>Point is, there are people structured to accept risk. These people include investors and entrepreneurs. There are other people who provide services that businesses need, including designers, lawyers, programmers, etc. These people generally aren't structured to accept risk, they need an hour's pay for an hour's work.<p>Because programmers can often be confused as to what role they play in a business through fast-talk, there's this notion that has developed that there are lots of programmer/investors available, who are willing and able to accept risk in lieu of payment.<p>There are clearly programmers who will accept that arrangement at least once due to their naivety, but they they generally learn pretty quickly, and I think it's becoming more common knowledge in the programmer community that it's an arrangement best avoided.",1333072685

They are also discovering that software is hard and is the future of mobile.<p>I say this as someone who was happily employed there a little as three weeks ago (I left to join a startup -- and yes, I absolutely loved my job at RIM). They have some good people but the majority of upper management is lost without a map.<p>They opted to create another mobile OS/ecosystem. The talent is certainly there, but the time is quickly running out. Apple has been working on iOS for years. Microsoft has been in the OS business for decades. Android is based on Java which has countless man-years behind the tools. RIM is working from QNX which is nice, but is not a full-blown OS/toolchain. There's a lot of work to do there; they've really only been at it for less than a year.<p>And let's face it: BBOS was something only its mother could love.",1333072434

Although I firmly believe that hangman is a game, and hence the assumptions of game theory are in full effect, I had not considered the information theory take on things :)<p>Since you asked about the Nash equilibrium for this case, here it is:<p>In the event that you did not have enough questions to uniquely identify the possible words (and assuming that words with more letters than guesses are not allowed ie every word can be guessed with the right questions), the game becomes a matching game [<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_pennies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_pennies</a>].<p>First both players will work out the minimum number of question paths that can identify every allowed word. Any word in more than one set will be ignored as a dominated strategy by the hosting player. Then the guessing player will pick randomly between question paths, and the hosting player will pick randomly among the disjoint sets of words at the end of those question paths, with the specific word not mattering.<p>You can see that once both players are picking between several options, with the entire game riding on their choice, the actual letter guessing becomes unimportant. The game itself resembles an unfair rock paper scissors.<p>If the players were betting $1 per round, the expected value to the guesser is ($2 divided by the number of disjoint sets) - $1.",1333071692

It made a great loaner device for when my girlfriend's parents had to drive halfway across the country with just a candybar pay-as-you-go phone.<p>Google's failing was twofold, in my opinion:<p>1) They initially said the device would sell cheaply, in the $200-300 range.  Instead, the two launch devices were $500+, a price range which encroached on territory already covered by other, more powerful, and more featureful devices.<p>2) Lack of proper marketing.  The Chromebook may have been less powerful, but it had a battery life like you wouldn't believe.  I used mine daily, taking it to meetings at work to take notes on, browsing the web on breaks, yet I only had to charge it every few days, sometimes just once or twice a week.  And that SSD!  Every time I showed it to my coworkers, the first thing I did was close the lid to put it into hibernation, then re-open it and show how it was instantly back at its previous state.  It truly behaved as though it remained powered on throughout the process, despite going into a low-power state that could last for weeks.  Unfortunately, these and other great features were unknown to the average consumer.<p>As far as updates, however, their setup is top-notch.

The language of testing is a standard form of English with which some Blacks may not be familiar; specific vocabulary items are often unfamiliar to Black children; the tests are often given by White examiners rather than by more familiar Black teachers; African Americans may not be motivated to work hard on tests that so clearly reflect White values; the time demands of some tests may be alien to Black culture. (Similar suggestions have been made in connection with the test performance of Hispanic Americans, e.g., Rodriguez, 1992.) Many of these suggestions are plausible, and such mechanisms may play a role in particular cases. Controlled studies have shown, however, that none of them contributes substantially to the Black/White differential under discussion here (Jensen, 1980; Reynolds & Brown, 1984; for a different view see Helms, 1992).

3774033,comment,3772292,3772917,6,0,smsm42,,,"Most IQ tests - at least ones I've seen - are highly trainable, both in general (you learn to think certain way) and in particular (you learn to solve specific type of test). So while tests aren't race-dependent and there's no reason to think they might be, they definitely can be culture-dependent and income (or, more precisely, education level and type) dependent. So while the test <i>is</i> an objective measure, it in an objective measure of test performance, which may not be strongly correlated with the actual work performance. Remember those ""move the mount Fuji"" interview questions which were so in fashion some years ago?<p>I'm not saying banning them completely the right answer here, but putting too much faith into these tests can be dangerous too.",1333070100

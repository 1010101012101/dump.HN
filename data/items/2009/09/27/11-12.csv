846770,comment,846330,846681,0,0,by,,,"It's a common misconception that programming languages must deal with side-effects. A program  can be a pure function if it is a single function that takes parameters when it is run and it returns a set of results when it exits. Interactive programs which take a sequence of inputs or generate a sequence of outputs as they are running have to deal with side-effects.",1254052403

846765,comment,846382,846753,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I can do it in LZW in 10 times fewer bytes than you can do it in Python :) I think comparing statically typed languages to dynamically typed languages takes more than counting. You also have to test and maintain the system. Others have to make sense of the code you write, etc. And now show me your 2x fewer lines of Python code :-)",1254051692

846759,comment,846357,846591,0,0,yters,,,"I like the idea.  The dot is basically shorthand for what we use the score for, minus a kind of ""attractor"" effect whereby two high scores, one higher than the other, skews my mind one way.<p>Anyways, have definitely noticed a distinct difference in how I read thread.  Instead of skimming scores, I now skim text.",1254050762
846758,comment,846699,846699,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"Someone asks in the comments why patents work better in pharmaceuticals.<p>A book I read recently claimed it all came down how precisely and clearly the patent is defined and delineated.<p>Imagine you moved into a lush valley with a new town in it to do business. If you found all the best spots had been taken and fenced in then that would kind of suck.<p>Imagine now that people had secretly claimed land, and done so in a way that even they didn't know what the boundary was. ""That land over there"" or ""the thickest part of the forest"" and yet these secret, vague claims could be legally enforced. Imagine investing money to build on that land, trying your best to avoid accidentally stepping on anyone's property.<p>The first case is chemical compounds, it's either got those atoms in that arrangement or it doesn't. The latter is ""selling shoes over the internet"" and other alleged software patents.<p>Though having said that I think patents are still broken and lead to the promotion of some very strange behaviour in the medical field. But in software they are appallingly bad.",1254050308

How does not having a lot of lawyers make it dangerous?<p>Big companies have virtually unlimited legal resources. Small companies don&#x27;t -- lawyer time is very expensive for them. Anecdotally, it seems to cost around $5 million to mount a defense against a big public company in court.<p>BigCo&#x27;s lawyers will file every type of complaint, motion, appeal, request, notice, stay and postponement possible in hopes of starving you out. You have to pay your lawyers for all the hours they spend just responding to frivolous and/or repetitious crap, which will end up being in the man-weeks before your first court date. You have to pay your lawyers to do all the pre-trial research, negotiation and strategizing, which costs will end up being in the man-months by the time you get to an actual court.<p>Once you finally <i>do</i> get to court, BigCo&#x27;s $1000/hr law firm will mount very aggressive and convoluted legal arguments and attempt to mint new legal theories, because a) it greatly increases the complexity of the case, which means you&#x27;re more likely to run out of money and concede to their client; b) their client doesn&#x27;t care how much money the law firm is going to bill them, so the law firm is going to have a heyday and squeeze out every billable hour possible; and c) if the new legal theory <i>actually works</i> by some fluke of luck, both the firm and the attorneys directly involved in the case will get a big boost to their industry starpower. What does all this mean for the little guy that&#x27;s being brought to court? It means your defense is going to cost you <i>a lot</i> of money.<p>There&#x27;s also the possibility that the court will grant an injunction against your behavior while the issue pends, and if that affects the wrong thing, it&#x27;s possible that your entire revenue stream will be destroyed and you&#x27;ll either have to pivot on a moment&#x27;s notice or just give up. Since these cases usually take years to see all the way through, you&#x27;ll be out of business for quite a while, even if the court ultimately vindicates your position. Small companies can&#x27;t afford to go without their revenue for years at a time.<p>For an example, refer to the case of Uzi Nissan, an IT technician who operated a computer repair business under his own name before Datsun rebranded to Nissan Motor. Nissan Motor drug him through an unsuccessful 9 year, $3 million saga to attempt to wrest the domain name from him. At the end of it, Nissan Motor was ordered to reimburse Mr. Nissan only $52k in legal fees, of the over $3 million Mr. Nissan was forced to spend, and Nissan Motor began pursuing a frivolous trademark filing so they could make a second attempt to steal the domain by use of legal force. [0]<p>Anyway, businesses can&#x27;t be represented by an entrepreneur in court, they have to be represented by a member of the bar. If you can&#x27;t afford to regularly refresh a 6-figure retainer as your lawyers fend off the vultures, you&#x27;re basically SOL. You have to comply, or be sued. If you get sued and proceed without retaining good counsel, it&#x27;s likely that you&#x27;ll end up more FUBAR&#x27;d than you would&#x27;ve been if you had just complied with whatever the demand was in the first place. Compare <i>Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc.</i>, where the entrepreneur had issues keeping counsel on board and ended up being held personally liable for $3 million in damages.<p>As such, if any big corp is able to identify things they don&#x27;t like before those things have begun to generate dozens of millions in annual revenues (enough to semi-comfortably fork over $500k-$1m/yr for legal defense), they can pretty successfully sue them out of existence. This happens regularly, you just don&#x27;t hear about it that often.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.digest.com/Big_Story.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.digest.com/Big_Story.php</a>",1451457697

10811023,comment,10802413,10807275,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"> Yes, it is hard to show the beneficial effects of a patent system, just as it is to show any ill effects thereof<p>It&#x27;s quite easy to show the ill effects thereof.  It&#x27;s harder to evaluate the beneficial effects, as you&#x27;d have to find and model metrics about the net value of inventions that, with all else equal, nobody would have developed or released in the absence of patents.  That then makes it hard to evaluate the patent system on balance, to see whether the benefits outweigh the costs.<p>I&#x27;m certainly <i>not</i> going to argue that that the patent system produces no benefits whatsoever; there almost certainly exist some inventions that nobody would have developed or productized without patents, or would not have done so on the same timeline.  My argument is that those benefits no longer outweigh the costs.<p>I read the meta-study you linked to, and found it quite unmoving.  They <i>explicitly</i> note via several studies that patents have little effectiveness in inducing disclosure (particularly as such disclosure has little value when engineers rarely read patents and would take a high risk in doing so).  Their discussions and linked studies of efficacy at promoting invention itself seem far too focused on direct economic value as a measure of invention value, and the remainder of their study focuses almost exclusively on economic value.<p>Any methodology that counts a patent troll like Intellectual Ventures in the &quot;positive&quot; column is broken; yes, they cause money to move, but only as a valueless drag force on useful work.<p>> Would you claim that those technologies that were suppressed, left our or unexplored were otherwise unavailable on the market? Or were these efforts simply re-inventing something already done before?<p>Both, and other cases as well.  I&#x27;ve seen patents used to threaten newly created technologies (e.g. entirely new video codecs still threatened by the MPEG-LA protection racket), from-scratch reimplementations of existing technologies in FOSS, and new applications of existing technologies (e.g. novel applications of arithmetic coding or cryptographic algorithms).<p>>> You can write code entirely from scratch, create something useful, publish it, be sued by someone you&#x27;ve never even heard of, and lose, all because of an artificial monopoly over ideas.<p>> And you can invent a whole new and useful product line, develop it from scratch, bring it to market and be ripped off and put out of business by bigger guys, all because of insufficient protection of ideas.<p>I simply can&#x27;t see those cases as remotely similar.  In one case, a technology or product is suppressed because of an artificial monopoly on ideas, even if people want that technology or product.  In the other case, someone else builds a better product and puts the first out of business, and was not stopped from building a better product by the first company&#x27;s artificial monopoly.  I don&#x27;t <i>care</i> who first threw paperwork and money at a government office; I care about the better product.<p>To rephrase that another way: in one case, you have two consenting parties that want to do business, but are stopped by a third that neither one wants anything to do with.  In the second case, you have two parties that consider doing business, but one chooses to do business with a third party instead because they get more value by doing so.<p>That&#x27;s leaving aside the very likely scenario that a patent intended for such a purpose <i>cannot</i> be used &quot;successfully&quot; against a bigger company.  The standard scenario: &quot;Oh, you have a couple of patents that you claim we infringe?  That&#x27;s adorable; we have a few thousand covering what you&#x27;ve done, and we won&#x27;t tell you which ones.  Perhaps we&#x27;ll pretend you never brought this up, or perhaps we&#x27;ll give you a discount on the money <i>you&#x27;re</i> going to pay <i>us</i> if you let us use your patents to stomp the next one of you upstarts.&quot;<p>I realize that the cases that show up in the media have a severe selection bias, and that many patent cases get settled confidentially.  However, I can readily bring to mind numerous instances of patents used to threaten new entrants to a market, or used for trolling by companies providing negative value.  By contrast, not a single case comes to mind of a patent used as you&#x27;ve described, to &quot;defend&quot; a product by the inventor&#x27;s company against a larger company.<p>I don&#x27;t believe technological progress will grind to a halt, or even slow down, with patents (or even just software patents) abolished.  I won&#x27;t necessarily argue with as much confidence that it will massively accelerate, either, though it certainly will in areas I care about.  But I can honestly say that I&#x27;ve never <i>once</i> seen a patent lawsuit in which I could muster the slightest sympathy for the plaintiff or the slightest belief that they deserve anything.  And I&#x27;ve read a substantial number of patent lawsuits, both contemporary and historical.",1451456512

10811011,comment,10803775,10809858,0,0,pron,,,"First, we should separate the <i>motivation</i> for the lawsuit from the legal arguments. Corporations don&#x27;t go to court to win legal arguments; they go to court to defend or promote their business.<p>I) The motivation for the lawsuit was that at the time, Java&#x27;s main revenue stream was licensing Java IP (either an actual implementation or the permission to implement the spec) for use in mobile devices. That was how Sun made money off of Java. Java&#x27;s <i>commercial</i> license allowed people to freely implement the specification as long as they pass the compatibility test, unless the implementation was for use in mobile devices -- this required a paid license. Google then created an implementation of (a part of) the spec, and didn&#x27;t reach a licensing agreement with Sun (they couldn&#x27;t agree on a price; I think Sun wanted $25M for the first five years or something). Google used Java IP to directly attack said IP&#x27;s main revenue source. That is not to say that what they did wasn&#x27;t legal, but that is why what they did mattered to Sun (and then Oracle) enough to sue them. Google needed Java because developing a language ecosystem suitable for phone application takes years. Google knew that such a lawsuit is forthcoming -- you can&#x27;t come at a company like that and not expect one -- but hoped that they could defend their actions in court, at least on legal grounds. So that&#x27;s what the lawsuit was about.<p>II) Now for the legal case. Oracle wanted to get their (in their view -- fair) share of Android no matter how, so they used -- as anyone does -- any legal argument they could think of which would get the desired business result, from patents to copyright. Some stuck, some didn&#x27;t. In the end, it was the API copyright argument that convinced the (appeals) court. But before I say a few words about that, let me reiterate: Oracle didn&#x27;t set out to copyright APIs; they set out to get a share of Android, which attacked their main Java revenue stream directly using their own IP. Anyway, Google claimed that APIs aren&#x27;t copyrightable, but Oracle won that round. Now, I will not go into this question itself -- there are good arguments for both sides -- but only into its ramifications. Google started a <i>massive</i> PR campaign to convince people that that ruling is disastrous for them, but it isn&#x27;t, and for several reasons.<p>First, it applies <i>only</i> to language-level APIs; not REST protocols, recently also referred to as APIs. This is not open to interpretation. Web &quot;APIs&quot; are not copyrightable for completely other reasons, reasons which are impossible (as much as anything in law is impossible) to argue against. Second, the court ruled that some of Google&#x27;s argument regarding the copyrightability of APIs are really fair use arguments, and this is the second crucial point: if something is copyrighted, that does not mean you may not freely use it for some purposes. When it comes to interfaces, one fair use defense has been interoperability[1]. Courts have ruled it legal to &quot;violate&quot; copyright for the purpose of creating components that are interoperable with the original. This means that if you implement an API in order to break vendor lockin, you&#x27;re probably within your right to do so. However, that is not what Google did in this particular case (Android is not interoperable with Java, only very, very partially). So while Google may still lose the fair-use question (which is still on the table), nearly all other implementors would still be protected by fair use.<p>To sum up the <i>legal</i> issue, while it has been in Google&#x27;s best interest to cause panic, the ruling does not apply to any other player but Google because:<p>1. It <i>only</i> applies to language-level APIs; it does not and cannot apply to web APIs and other protocols (either software or hardware).<p>2. Implementing an API is protected by the interoperability fair-use defense, even if Google&#x27;s particular (and highly unusual) use isn&#x27;t.<p>And in any case, unless you use a company&#x27;s (language-level) API against it, there is little chance they&#x27;ll come after you; if you do, well, you knew they&#x27;d come after you even before this court case.<p>III) Finally, it is important to note that all along Google had the option of freely using OpenJDK. The use of OpenJDK does not require conformance with the Java standard; it is completely unencumbered. The reason Google opted not to do it was because at the time they were afraid phone manufacturers would not like OpenJDKs license, GPLv2 + the classpath exception, even though Android also make use of Linux, which is also licensed under the GPL. This reasoning seems to have changed now.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/cps182s/fall02/cscopyright/Copyrights/Copyright-Fairuse.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/cps182s/fall02/cscopyright/C...</a>",1451456167

6255384,comment,6253639,6254513,1,0,einhverfr,,,"I agree with this, but only to a certain degree.<p>Very often laws exist in part to create legal fictions, and these laws are effectively broken all the time, but one can pretend that they are followed.  These legal fictions can be extremely valuable.<p>For example in Indonesia abortion is illegal.  The primary effect of this is that abortion clinics pay off police a small amount generally, and get prosecuted if something bad happens.  Paradoxically, this is important to ensuring the quality of care.  Everyone gets to pretend that abortions are banned, but in actuality, they are accessible and regulated by a position of being relatively legally vulnerable.<p>The problem is that when the fictions are unsustainable, then there is no semblance of respect that can be left.  Once this is gone, though it isn&#x27;t clear it can be salvaged.  This is why this is so big.  The government has shown that they have massively betrayed our trust and this means that certain tools of law enforcement just won&#x27;t work in the future.",1377151139

6255378,comment,6254721,6255033,19,0,Dn_Ab,,,"Very true, glad I&#x27;m not the only one to have noticed this. And I&#x27;ve got a suggestion for a search engine so intelligent - well relatively - it took google back to school and enrolled it in kindergarten. I find myself using it whenever Google gets stumped; it consistently gives better results in the sense that I feel it has a better understanding of my query. Take this example that prompted my above semi-hyperbole. Background:<p>Four days ago, while walking around outside I saw an insect. Normally this is nothing to write home about except that I had originally mistaken this insect for an assorted clump of debris. So you can imagine my surprise when not only did it start moving, it did so with gusto, scaling walls and what not. Strangest thing I&#x27;ve ever seen. So I thought I&#x27;d check Google to find out what manner of sorcery this was. I expected nothing of course - I had no clue where to start. Search term: &quot;insect with a bunch of junk attached to it&quot;.<p>Google Result: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/FGIInog.png?1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/FGIInog.png?1</a> vs. Other Search Engine Result: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/t8ei8dX.png?1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/t8ei8dX.png?1</a><p>What I sought was the debris carrying lacewing larvae. Result 2 is far off but I was so happy to put a name to the entity I did not even register that result.<p>The first thing you will notice is Google trying way too hard and ending up with idiotic suggestions as a result. It seems to use the words <i>and their synonyms</i> without accounting for context. That is the only way it could possibly give PHP, email and bugzilla reports as possible answers to that query [1]. It&#x27;s a common recent pattern I&#x27;ve been noticing, unless I can model how I think people will write about what I&#x27;m searching for and more importantly it is not something the SEO people have motive to polish so vigorously, the content is accidently removed; I won&#x27;t get good results. That SEO bit is annoying because I remember when my previous searches in the genre (e.g. game related) used to be far more fruitful. The new behavior of adding synonyms is particularly not worth it since the fails are much more spectacular than it wins.<p>Final stuff: I also compare bing, duck duck go and blekko results whenever I hit queries I think are complicated, none do much better than google. Sometimes they are worse. This result is the first time Samuru blew everyone out of the water, usually it is modestly better [2] (answer in second half vs not so for others [3]). The reason I still use google is force of habit, it took over chrome and most importantly: its incredible and unmatched indexing ability. But I use samuru enough that it&#x27;s one of my most visited pages.<p>I have absolutely no affiliation with them, don&#x27;t know who it&#x27;s by and found out about it here on HN. According to Paul Graham, Google can be tackled if they can get 10,000 hackers on their side. Time to put the hypothesis to the test, <i>+1</i> here.<p>[1] Here is the same search with quotes: <a href=""http://imgur.com/qiGDnqr&t8ei8dX#0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/qiGDnqr&t8ei8dX#0</a><p>[3] I only sometimes check page 2 for the others. This might seem unfair but a key UX concept is to minimize latency. Clicking to page 2 seems minor but the EV for that action is so low I skip it. But scrolling just a bit more since I&#x27;m already here is much cheaper. UX should absolutely count as much as tech (UX/process + human + algorithms > all).<p>[2] My annoyance with such vague anecdotes is why I decided to start taking screenshots. And also because results are not stable. For example, search terms that bing once did well on are now embarrassing.",1377151017

6255358,comment,6253324,6254688,6,0,grey-area,,,"Exactly. They should be reporting the resolution of each image in pixels, and leave the client to figure out what they want to download based on variables like connection speed, screen PPI, user settings etc. Trying to specify a scale just doesn&#x27;t make sense, because the UA might be any resolution or multiple resolutions, might degrade for edge connections etc - the UA is best-placed to decide which images it wants, and that should be on the basis of source image resolution in pixels, not some arbitrary scale. Using 2x, 4x, 1280w is tied to the conventions of our current devices, which <i>will</i> change many times in the future, and doesn&#x27;t provide useful information about the src image itself. Why do this?<p>They&#x27;ve done the same thing with resolution independence on iOS - instead of some sensible system of scaling and caching, we&#x27;ve ended up with a situation where images and icons are saved in several different versions by the developer just to cope with all the different possible resolutions/ratios using this sort of @2x naming scheme, and all based off arbitrary resolutions of screens which are going to change. It&#x27;s a mess.<p>I think they&#x27;d be better with something like this:<p><pre><code>    <picture>\n       <source src=&quot;myjpg.jpg&quot; width=100 height=100>   \n       <source src=&quot;myjpglrg.jpg&quot; width=1000 height=1000>\n       <img src=&quot;myjpg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fallback img tag or text&quot;>\n    </picture>\n</code></pre>\nWe already have this scheme of source elements for audio and video, and this is the perfect moment to introduce something a bit more sane for images too. There&#x27;s no need for the specification of arbitrary resolution intents if you give the src sizes. This would also let us transparently handle new file formats with fallback to older ones with type attributes, as with audio and video tags. For example you might start introducing SVG versions of many images, but leave a png source in there for older browsers.<p>The above proposal already displays perfectly fine in older browsers if you use an img tag within the <picture> tags for backwards compatibility, and could easily be dealt with in older IE with workarounds if necessary, though I think the img tag would display fine.<p>CSS can then be used to control the intended display size.",1377150599

6255290,comment,6253773,6253773,72,0,lhh,,,"I spent two years working as an analyst at a &quot;bulge bracket&quot; (ie top 10) investment bank in NYC (plus a summer as an intern). It seems that a lot of HNers are unfamiliar with the world of I-Banking, so here&#x27;s the my view of what it&#x27;s like, or at least what it was like in my group at my bank (though I believe my experience generalizes fairly well):<p>Analyst jobs are extremely competitive to land. It&#x27;s an intensive interview process, and the vast majority of analysts do an internship first and are then hired on full time for the following year. As you might imagine, the job pays very well. Market rate at a bulge bracket firm for a first year analyst is $10k signing bonus, $70k base salary, and anywhere from $0 to ~$85k in bonus, though typically bonus is in the $55k - $75k range, depending on individual, group, and bank performance. As a second year, base and expected bonus each receive a $10k bump. Plus dinner is paid for every night, and lunches as well on weekends, which adds up to about another $10k. Most banks have a two year analyst program. A small percentage of analysts stay for a third year if offered (maybe 10%), and maybe 50-75% of those continue on to become associates, which puts them on track to eventually become a senior banker. Most associates were never analysts, but were instead hired in after doing an MBA.<p>After putting in the time as an analyst, a host of other opportunities await. Those with bulge bracket investment banking experience get all sorts of attention from recruiters. Many go on to work in private equity or for a hedge fund, both of which tend to pay significantly more than banking but with much more sane hours and a far better quality of life. Others do things like biz dev or take other misc finance roles. A very select few decide to go the startup route (eg this guy).<p>The combination of perceived prestige, high pay, and quality exit opportunities draw legions of juniors and seniors to apply. Senior bankers know that the role is in extremely high demand, and therefore they tend to be very tough on their analysts. If one analyst burns out, there are hundreds more frantically trying to network their way in to take their place.<p>There&#x27;s a very clear divide between what a senior banker does and what a junior banker does. Senior bankers are glorified sales people. Their job is to maintain relationships (and develop new ones) with clients so that when the client decides to do a deal (any sort of M&A, financing, or restructuring), they&#x27;ll hire the bank that employs said senior banker to execute/advise on the transaction. A junior banker&#x27;s job is to do anything and everything that senior bankers tell them to do.<p>Junior bankers have very little control over their own lives. They&#x27;re staffed on many projects at once (at one point I had 12 different projects I was juggling), and usually have minimal say on what projects they&#x27;re assigned. These projects are generally all with different sets of people. Each senior banker tends to have a sub-industry and group of clients they cover, but junior bankers get shuffled around to work on any project that needs staffing. This staffing is determined by a &quot;staffer&quot; (usually a semi-senior banker), which is entirely discretion based. They try to make an effort to make the distribution of work equitable, but they have their job to do outside of being a staffer, and being a good staffer doesn&#x27;t advance their career in the slightest, so they&#x27;re not incentivized to really get this right. The work generally goes to the analyst that looks/seems the least busy.<p>I can&#x27;t begin to describe how fucked up of a dynamic this creates. Insidious, underhanded politics. Analysts essentially forced to stay at the office until everyone above them has left the office regardless of whether or not they have anything to do. If you leave before the staffer leaves, you&#x27;re guaranteed to get hit with the next staffing. If you leave before everyone above your level has left, they&#x27;ll be bitching the next day about how they&#x27;re working so hard even the analysts are leaving before them. Analysts subtly dropping hints to senior bankers about how much harder they&#x27;re working than the other analysts, both in an effort to get staffing diverted away from themselves and because analysts all get ranked against each other at the end of the year, which determines their bonus. Analysts are ranked on a bell curve against each other, and bonus payouts among them are a zero-sum game. Recruiters and interviewers will ask you point-blank what your ranking and compensation was.<p>Analysts carry a blackberry with them at all times, and a staffing can blow up their next two weeks literally at any moment. You live in constant fear that that little red light blinking on your blackberry isn&#x27;t another staffing or fire drill (ie &quot;emergency&quot; work that needs to be done immediately). You can&#x27;t plan anything. Being too slow to respond to emails, including at midnight on weekends, is grounds for getting sat down for a stern conversation in a conference room. My blackberry was never more than 20 ft away from me for two solid years.<p>My average day was about 9:30am - 12:30am on weekdays, and about noon to 6pm on weekends. I didn&#x27;t have my first day off, including weekends, until 4 months into the job. Sometimes it was as light as 50 hours per week, and sometimes as bad as 110+. Some of the time you actually have so much work to do that you&#x27;re eating every meal at your desk and working solid the entire time, especially if you&#x27;re working on a live deal, but a lot of the time you&#x27;re just waiting around for other people to get back to you. They give you some work to do on a document or presentation, you spend a few hours doing it and get it back to them, and then you wait for them to get it back to you for another round of edits. You&#x27;ll usually be doing this with 4 or 5 projects at a time, all with varying levels of complexity and urgency. This is one good part about the job. During the &quot;day shift&quot;, life usually isn&#x27;t so bad. A lot of times you can get away with long lunches and frequent starbucks runs without anyone really noticing. But then after a fairly leisurely day, come around 5pm or so, the &quot;night shift&quot; starts. You&#x27;ll get edits to do for all of your projects at once and occasionally end up pulling an all nighter, even when the majority of the work you&#x27;re doing involves formatting charts, transcribing pages of handwritten notes, and various other trivial, mind-numbing tasks.<p>You&#x27;d be amazed at how much effort we&#x27;d be asked to expend on some task relative to the benefit that that task could possibly hope to provide. Like put together this 10 page weekly update for every company in X industry, including what research analysts said about them that week, what the media has said about them, individual product sales, graphs of their stock price movements and their valuation multiples, etc. All painfully slow, manual work. There were 40-50 companies in this industry. For an update that was sent to a single client. Unsolicited. When the CFO hated the senior banker who ordered the update and would never do a deal with him in his life. Doing mind-numbing work is one thing, but spending hours and hours doing it when you know it&#x27;s all for nothing is an indescribable feeling. I wanted to bash my head in with a stapler. It took me THREE MONTHS to finally convince the staffer to tell the senior banker it wasn&#x27;t going to happen anymore. All sorts of absurd shit like this was thrust upon us in the name of potentially winning business.<p>I could keep going and probably fill several volumes about how horrible of an experience it was, but I&#x27;ll stop there. The best day of my life to date was the day I turned in my blackberry and walked out of the building for the last time. I don&#x27;t think that the people I worked with were inherently evil or anything like that. All else equal, they&#x27;d be senstive to our well being. But at the end of the day, we were just another class of indentured servants, like the many classes they&#x27;d seen before us and the many they&#x27;d see after.<p>When I would describe my life to friends and people I&#x27;d meet that weren&#x27;t a part of the finance world, they would literally think I was making things up. The idea that someone would be willing to subject themselves to such insanity, or more accurately that an employer would demand it, wasn&#x27;t part of their world view. I assure you, it was really that bad. I&#x27;m a pretty stable person, but there were a couple times where I came very close to coming unglued. Somehow we managed to convince ourselves it was all worth it. The jury&#x27;s still out on that one.",1377148760

6255270,comment,6251087,6251627,8,0,mmorett,,,"I think part of the problem is the breadth of material for which you can be questioned in.  Since I live in the Java world, let me use that as an example.<p>I have <i>heard</i> of anonymous classes.  I&#x27;ve never used one on the job.  Maybe that&#x27;s a function of me being more server side and I think anonymous classes are use more heavily in Swing. Ditto for reflection -- aware of it and when to use it, but just never had the need.  For better or worse, the pieces of functionality I&#x27;ve had to build out over the years simply did not require me to use those pieces of Java.  There are countless of pieces of Java that I simply do not use, even if I&#x27;m aware of them.<p>A Java developer (at least in my circles) rarely just codes in Java all day.  Often, they&#x27;re using a framework. It might be Spring.  It might be Hibernate.  Right there, you have two vertical streams of expertise they could pounce on. Now add SQL.  Even if you&#x27;re using Hibernate, you&#x27;ll still need some fundamental knowledge of SQL.  Likely, they&#x27;ll hit you with HQL questions.  Maybe some lazy loading.  Maybe some optimistic locking.<p>Maybe add EJBs.  Maybe add JPA.  Throw in some jQuery/HTML/CSS (unless they live exclusively in the server tier).  Inevitably, some may ask about stored procs/PL-SQL.   Oh what the hell...let&#x27;s add web services, SOAP, REST, Ajax, JMS, transaction isolation levels, clustering, SSL.  And so on.  Wait...add Linux admin.<p>The disconnect (anxiety?) comes from a developer having to use so many technologies, which is realistic, and the interviewer salivating at the opportunity to go deep in any one of those.<p>&quot;Excuse me...you can&#x27;t write a static nested inner class?  And you call yourself a Java developer?&quot;<p>I once had an interviewer <i>disappointed</i> in not being able to ask me PL/SQL questions, despite me not even having PL/SQL on my resume. He just wanted to go there.<p>The interviews are often based on a notion that a developer does nothing else but use the language to its fullest.  All day.  Every day. Reality suggests that a developer uses only as much of a language as needed to build out a piece of functionality for a given need.  They don&#x27;t use every data structure available, nor necessarily every major piece of the language.<p>There&#x27;s seemingly no way around this conflict.  The interview is focused on a language.  The developer is often focused on putting together solutions.  Depth vs. breadth.<p>For the record, I had an interview once for a Grails developer spot and was asked about UDP.  Yes, seriously...UDP.<p>We&#x27;re not God.  We&#x27;re just developers.",1377147951

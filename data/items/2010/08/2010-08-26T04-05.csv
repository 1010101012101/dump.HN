In return for that money, they get to see another season of their favorite cancelled TV show (well, they would if the networks were smart enough to work that way).<p>So if I donated $5 to this startup and got a life membership with like 3 fighting dudes, while they charge $1/mo post-launch with the same plan, I'd call that a pretty fair bargain.

That could mean they were acquired, or closed down for a good reason. For instance, if you built a startup with a great product but not much traction, and that attracted the interest of a company that hired you for a $250,000 per annum salary, that would be a ""failed business"" in this statistic, but obviously it worked out pretty well for you.<p>I've ran companies that are no longer going concerns, but that delivered things that made customers happy, paid employees well in an awesome work environment, and the founders made good coin and had good experiences. Now everyone's moved on to other things, but these aren't failures (even though they'd be counted so in that statistic).<p>Also - Companies fail. Persistent entrepreneurs succeed.",1282798171

When you don't stretch it out all the way then the position of the elements keep changing as apps get added to the dock. So, for example, dropping something into the trash or opening a new finder window (or any other app you have permanently in the dock) can't be done by muscle memory. You need to locate it with the mouse each time.<p>What would you do with the extra space on the 2 sides of the dock anyway? You can't really populate them with windows since the dock will, in all likelihood be covering part of the window.<p>I agree with the menus at the top.

Turns out if you pay people craploads per hour, you get <i>fewer</i> hours out of them, not more. This is unlike every other supply curve--if you pay $1,000 per hour of labor you get less labor than if you pay $100 per hour of labor, but if you pay $1,000 per gross of self-sealing stem bolts you get way, way, way more self-sealing stem bolts than if you pay $100 per gross of self-sealing stem bolts.<p>The worst you get from ordinary supply curves is diminishing returns. If you paid $1,000,000 per bushel of apples, well, you're just throwing away money--I'm sure we'd max out the earth's apple-growing capacity well before $500,000 per bushel.

However, we assure you by not controlling your drawing, its actually much cooler. Its not really about me vs you, its about my ninja vs your dinosaur. We are bringing these drawings to life. By letting people control the characters it would belittle the intelligence behind the game and be like every other fighting game out there.
It is much more rewarding to see your character preform an epic karate kick because you have drawn long legs and a headband rather than just pressing the B button. Its more of a strategy/design/creation game rather than a traditional fighting game. All the fun is had with a pencil and paper.",1282797671

Believe me, it's quite blighted but has been on the up and up in the last 5 years or so. The handful of people who held out were operating storage facilities, gas stations and mechanics shops.

Seems like this article is a whole jumble of conflicting information starting with the title (Hit with the force of 100 bombs) whereas in the body of the article it says ""the blast will have the equivalent energy of 100 million hydrogen bombs."" and it doesn't say who made this claim (despite the HN title seeming to attribute to NASA). It sounds very dramatic to say ""hit with"" but if it's actually something that's happening on the surface of the sun that's a very misleading way to phrase it.<p>And then when I read articles elsewhere on the web it sounds like NASA back in 2006 <i>was</i> predicting a big storm in 2012 but now they're saying the calculations were wrong and it will actually be unusually small. <a href=""http://thecosmicheart.blogspot.com/2009/11/no-more-2012-solar-maximum-for-cycle-24.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thecosmicheart.blogspot.com/2009/11/no-more-2012-sola...</a>",1282795849

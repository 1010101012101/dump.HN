It's a big corporation, but my particular team is just a group of 7 engineers who have simply been told to design a brilliant product - we have massive control over what the product does.  The problems we face are very similr to those that you get in a start-up, as we are building an entire product from scratch.<p>Yet, if you asked someone that hadn't worked there what they would expect the atmosphere to be like working there, they assume that you're probably going to be a cube-farm drone, putting out more paperwork than code.

This will be especially evident to those of you not in North America who unwittingly point to these servers.<p>In most global markets your best strategy is to use your local DNS resolver so the people who deliver everything from Netflix, iTunes, Hulu, ustream, (etc, etc, etc) understand that you're not in San Jose or Northern Virginia but really in Tokyo or Malaysia.

They are trying to make money their way, not by chasing whatever they see that might make most the money.  Creating a profitable business is one aspect of that, but perhaps a larger aspect is that they are unusually open about their opinions on design, process, and usability, etc.  This is a reason they are a bit polarizing and find detractors as well as fans.",1259906518

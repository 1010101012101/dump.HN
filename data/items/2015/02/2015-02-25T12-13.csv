9106482,comment,9076351,9105225,0,0,dogma1138,,,"Eh? the NSA didn&#x27;t pushed IDEA out, what pushed it is the fact that besides being actually substantially (esp. since 2013) less secure than AES and with poorer performance is that IDEA was a registered trademark and was under a full patent which meant implementing (prior to the patent expiration in 2012) was a nightmare.<p>I also hope that you don&#x27;t insinuate that ECC was &quot;invented&quot; by UW since elliptic curve cryptography was known for quite a long time.<p>By the backdoor I assume you mean the whole NIST curves fiasco, well besides the fact that it was in use almost no where, if you speak to actual mathematicians you&#x27;ll find out that it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. The NIST curve was more about performance enchantment than backdooring, altough sadly for NIST and for the NSA it failed at providing both.<p>The big problems with ECC is that it&#x27;s extremely susceptible to side channel attacks especially in embedded implementations, and that if you have the capability to use quantum computing for cryptanalysis then to break ECC you&#x27;ll need only about 25-50% of the compute time/power than you would need to break RSA.<p>Also since ECC is asymmetric and quite resource consuming it&#x27;s not really used in encryption as much as you think, sure it&#x27;s good in any situation where you can use PKI but PKI is rarely used to encrypt actual data. The common uses of PKI are for authentication and initial key exchange data encryption whether it&#x27;s in rest or in motion is usually based on symmetric encryption.",1424869126

Unfortunately for those wasting their time with such interviews it is a creative process. A recent Nobel prize in economics was given to Daniel Kahneman for his work proving such gut instinct interviews are a failure. When I first left college and was bad at software development I passed those tests, got into software firms and got my experience. Now even though I write software everyday for my clients I wouldn&#x27;t pass any of those interviews. Zuckerberg is right - younger people are smarter (at passing those tests).",1424869044
9106478,comment,9104188,9104562,0,0,mrottenkolber,,,"I think you are blaming a slightly arcane program for what is essentially laziness of the population. Every time I read a comment on HN stating how PGP isn&#x27;t usable I cry a little bit inside. GPG in no harder to use than git or many other tools professionals use.<p>The difference being, its worse to make a mistake using GPG than it is to make a mistake using most other programs. In the end, you are <i>securing</i> confidential information, which will <i>always</i> be hard, unnerving and require concentration and care. And this is just inherent to the task, which is fighting an undefined, super-powerful, ill-meaning enemy.<p>Encryption is violence. The objective is to violently keep an enemy away from your jewels. Instead of using an armed guard at your door, you use mathematical forces which are impossible for your enemy to overcome. Imagine your enemy needs the cleartext to save his own life, how does he feel when he is denied access and unable to gain access? It doesn&#x27;t matter if its a steel door or a block-cipher.<p>What people are essentially demanding when they want &quot;easy to use crypto&quot; is a self-firing and self-aiming rifle with friendly-fire detection. &quot;Keep all my adversaries away but don&#x27;t bother me about it.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not how conflict works. If you attempt to secure your communications from a state actor, you are engaging in a full-blown combat against one of the most deadly forces there can be. That conflict will always be demanding and unpleasant. GPG being &quot;hard to use&quot; will be the least of your problems.<p>But no, we want everything for free. Protecting yourself against the overlords should be easy and painless, almost automatic. The defendant shouldn&#x27;t have to learn how his defense works or how to properly use it.<p>Seriously?<p>EDIT: And what I find unnerving about your post is, suddenly the people who put in the effort to use GPG are the bad guys? The 0.1% who actually take privacy seriously enough to go through the the trouble? Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I almost never use GPG, not because it&#x27;s hard to use (M-x epa-encrypt-region, anyone?), but because I don&#x27;t want to experience the emotional distress related to struggling with a super-powered state.",1424869023

First, it&#x27;s well known that intelligence services passively listen to and collect any and all radio traffic. The issue then is can that traffic be decrypted, not can the traffic be spied on. Related to that is of course the use of frequency hopping -- but as I understand it, if frequency hopping uses N bands, and you have N antennas/radios at your disposal, you could listen and record all of them.<p>Secondly, we all know that if you have a sim card, you can connect to a 3g/4g network. What they seem to be implying, is that 3g/4g uses asymmetric encryption (certificates) for authentication, and that only the sim card knows its own secret key. Does anyone know is this is true? Did 3g/4g move away from shared-secret to asymmetric keys?<p>I hope I&#x27;m missing something -- because if not this press release is basically full of placating lies.",1424868985

But just as democratic societies have come to accept the preposterous notion that women should be allowed to vote, so too will it start seeing engineering as a non-manly profession, and one that&#x27;s perfectly natural for women, too. Right now, I think there are two things we can do: 1) place more women role models in popular culture who are engineers (I think Hollywood has started doing this), and 2) place more actual women role models in engineering positions.<p>The latter will only be achieved if the level of hostility women feel in the workplace is reduced, and to do that, employers (and engineers in general) will need to undergo some training. Part of that training (though certainly not all of it) would be learning to recognize sexism. Recognizing sexism is very hard if you&#x27;re not trained for it; there are two reasons for that: one, people confuse sexism with misogyny and assume that since they&#x27;re not misogynist, they can&#x27;t be sexist (while actually most forms of sexism are inadvertent/structural/cultural), and two, <i>because</i> sexism is cultural, we just don&#x27;t think of things that seem so natural to us, and can&#x27;t perceive the harm they cause. Because sexism and racism are discrimination + power, the best way to recognize them is not to look for discrimination (which is hard to see, and we don&#x27;t want to find it because it feels we&#x27;re being judged or doing something wrong) but for power. Once you know what power is, it is relatively easy to see. Once you learn to see power, you see who has more of it and who has less of it. Once you see that, it&#x27;s much easier to see whether through action or inaction your organization keeps the current unfair power distribution.",1424868167

9106381,comment,9105803,9105948,0,0,NateDad,,,"You really don&#x27;t need a package manager for Go.  Honestly, the main reason you need them for node, python, etc is because you&#x27;re deploying source code to your production environment.  You don&#x27;t do that with Go.  You deploy a binary, which has everything wrapped up in itself.  Think of it as a self-contained virtualenv that requires zero effort on your part :)<p>In Go, code is packaged via source control repos.  If you want a different version, you need a different repo.  There are some tools to mitigate this, so that you can get away with a different branch per version (see <a href=""http://gopkg.in"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gopkg.in</a>), which can make it a little nicer for the maintainer to deal with multiple branches.  To the consumer, it still looks like a different repo (i.e. every different version is a different URL to a repo).<p>Note that because Go is a compiled language, the only time versioning comes into play is a <i>development time</i>.  As long as your developers are using the right version, you never have to worry about versions during deployment.<p>Now, if you&#x27;re concerned that your project depends on code repos from external sources, then there are several tools that can insulate you from third parties doing stupid stuff.  The most complete and best one is called godep, which basically has two modes - reliable and paranoid.  The reliable mode insulates you from changes made to a repo you depend on by recording the exact VCS revision your project is using and always checks out that commit.  That way, if an upstream repo checks in a breaking change, it won&#x27;t affect you (and you control when you update to newer commits in that repo).  Paranoid mode actually copies all the code from your dependencies into your own repo. This insulates you from upstream repos getting deleted.  And of course, this gives you the ability to test out upstream changes before integrating them into your project.  The tool makes it easy to copy all of your dependencies at once with a single command, so it&#x27;s not a huge hassle to do (which it would be if you had to do it by hand).",1424867188

I encourage you to find someone who has it: a couple releases ago, they added some new &quot;physics-based&quot; swiping animations for dismissing images. They pretty much amount to 2D Waggle, but if you flick something super fast, you can really send it spinning.<p>When I first saw a GIF of that behavior in the release notes, I, too, thought it was pretty excessive.

So the news that nobody wants spread is: nobody cares about how much the NSA stole from Gemalto: whatever Gemalto has and NSA wants, the NSA is most likely to get by simply asking NSA affiliates installed at every interesting node in Gemalto&#x27;s hierarchy.<p>Incidentally, it&#x27;s rather easy to find sources about this in French (Gemplus used to be a French company, before the fusion with Axalto which was forced by intQtel and TPG), but surprisingly hard to find in English.",1424866284

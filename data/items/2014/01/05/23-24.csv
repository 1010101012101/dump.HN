No locking, just three-way merges in the case of conflict.<p>From the SOSP paper:<p>Finally, Ori is designed to facilitate file sharing. Using\na novel feature called grafts, one can copy a subtree of\none file system to another file system in such a way as to\npreserve the file history and relationship of the two directories. Grafts can be explicitly re-synchronized in either\ndirection, providing a facility similar to a distributed version control system (DVCS) such as Git. However,\nwith one big difference: in a DVCS, one must decide\nahead of time that a particular directory will be a repository; while in Ori, any directory can be grafted at any\ntime. By grafting instead of copying, one can later determine whether one copy of a file contains all changes in\nanother (a common question when files have been copied\nacross file systems and edited in multiple places.",1388966286

It seems that terrible execs would bring even more people with them and even faster, because they would need the old crowd insulators?<p>The idea is a bit too optimistic for me, as well as being a very lagging indicator for any hiring process.  I would also suggest that the risk for croneyism should be much more in the front of a hiring officer&#x27;s mind than positive referral, as the down side to a negative team drag could be huge for a smaller company.  Although, the positives of team drag can also be huge for a small company.  I guess all I was trying to say is that team drag is not always a positive indicator.",1388966284

This is not a problem of &quot;perceived&quot; decline over the past &quot;few months&quot;. If he&#x27;d take a minute to read the reviews of his products (Evernote AND particularly Skitch), there has been a quality decline over the past few <i>years</i> and no one to blame for it except his development team.",1388965063

Think it&#x27;s that it refuses to include formatting (either visual or data types) between different instances, right? Also a massive pain when it occurs, but luckily not too often for me.",1388963086

Consider the grammar for simple math expressions:<p><pre><code>    expr     ::= sum\n    sum      ::= product { (""+"" | ""-"") product }\n    product  ::= power   { (""*"" | ""/"") power }\n    power    ::= factor  [ ""^"" factor ]\n    factor   ::= ""("" expr "")"" | variable | constant\n    variable ::= identifier\n    constant ::= floatLiteral\n</code></pre>\nIt's pure-Scala is<p><pre><code>    def expr     = sum\n    def sum      = product ~ rep((""+"" | ""-"") ~ product)\n    def product  = power   ~ rep((""*"" | ""/"") ~ power)\n    def power    = factor  ~ opt(""^"" ~ factor)\n    def factor   = ""("" ~ expr ~ "")"" | variable | constant\n    def variable = ident    \n    def constant = floatLit \n</code></pre>\nAnd since it's pure-Scala, you get all the benefit of static typing (error detection, auto-complete, etc) when writing your parser.

4612550,comment,4612331,4612331,8,0,mattdeboard,,,"Like lukev said, git is ""an awesome set of primitives"". How you build a workflow out of those primitives isn't set in stone (though, like most things, Linus has strong opinions on exactly how to use his products). This is basically what Github has done, with an extra layer of UI glitz, social, and (much-improved) notifications.<p>That said, IMO there is still quite a lot of room for customization in git workflow when using Github. For example, we don't ""send patches around"" as Linus says. Our private feature branches live on Github but we've adopted the convention that the ""private"" branch name is prefixed by who's working on it, e.g. mdeboard-oauth, jschmoe-url-routes. If it has someone's name at the front, don't touch it. That enables us to still use the ""D"" in DVCS while retaining the ability to safely rebase our own work to keep our history clean.<p>The only reason I'd want a git-based product to ""enforce order"" is a culture-related one: ensure that contributors/collaborators do things in line with the conventions we've established. However, IMO it's always better to have a conversation about that than work with an overly prescriptive tool.",1349362548

4612541,comment,4611825,4612185,10,0,molmalo,,,"Not exactly, it's long, but here I go...<p>Malvinas/Falklands has always been a national claim, that has been brought to every possible international forum, for decades before the war in 1982, and of course, also after the war... So, that's not news.<p>The current overall economic situation is not as terrible as it may seem from outside. The main problem is that because of the high inflation, people try to have their savings in other currencies, but the government put restrictions on the amount of foreign money that can be bought. Sadly, tax evasion is commonplace here, so, it's hard to prove the origin of the money, and thus making it an impediment to buy US dollars.<p>But the overall situation is very complex. I have always said that the main problem in Argentina is that culturally, Argentine businessmen always try to make money selling a few products at a high price, instead of selling a lot of products at smaller prices (scale economy). And there's no focus on trying to change that mentality. That makes the local industry totally noncompetitive, and thus, the government has to rely in protectionist policies to prevent importers from flooding the local market with chinese products, that would simply destroy the local jobs (it has happened before, in the '80s, then again in the '90s).<p>As an example, you have some plain stupid policies, like having the electronics factories in the furthest possible place (Tierra del Fuego, the island just at the end of the continent!), far away from the consumption centers, making the prices go up as they have to move the manufacturing parts from Buenos Aires, to Tierra del Fuego, and then, the manufactured goods back to Tierra del Fuego/Cordoba. That's 3100 miles by road!<p>This kind of policies render the commendable idea of helping the local industry develop, totally useless because those industries will never be competitive.<p>On the other hand, historically, the main source of wealth in this country has always being agriculture. But sadly, since the 1800's, almost 80% of the country has been in the hands of a few families. Currently, 2000 families own almost all of the fields. And sadly, in the last 10 years, they stopped producing a lot of products (wheat, fruits, livestock), replacing most of the production with soybeans. That resulted in a huge increase in prices, something unthinkable in a food-producing country like this.<p>That, added to the fact that historically those families operate usually operate this way:\nThey sell the products through a shell company in some tax heaven country, thus declaring much lower earnings here (evading local taxes). Of course, this kind of behavior is possible because of the ever-existing corruption. Anyways, the money that they do bring here, is usually moved anyway to offshore bank accounts (generally luxemburg, switzerland or uruguay). Capital flight then becomes a common practice.<p>A few years ago, the government paid its debt to the IMF, and because it would have to eventually pay most of the debt to the remaining creditors, and its debt is adjusted by the inflation index they declare, they started forging that index. They did it by printing money, used to internal payments to government employees. Internally, as salaries were raised anually at the same level of inflation, it didn't change much to the average people. But in the long run, it affects business, as companies stop trusting the country, so they stop investing here.<p>As the government had to afford some payments this year to finally complete payments from the 2001 crisis (Boden 2012), they tried to stop this capital flight, but instead of doing it gradually, they did it in a shockingly fast way.<p>That generated a lot of social discontent in the middle classes. And of course, people are just sick high levels of the corruption and impunity. Some judges, just act as lackeys of the government, absolving government employees involved in public corruption scandals, even when there's a lot of evidence to make them go to prison.<p>And finally, Media conglomerates that have an enormous amount of power are fighting its own war against the government, that again, even when they are trying to implement an understandable law to replace one from the time of the last dictatorship, the small amount of time given to split the ""monopolies"", escalated everything.<p>Interestingly, even with all of this, the overall economic situation is not that bad, people still have their jobs, there are not massive layouts as seen in Europe, salaries grow at the same rate as inflation, compensating it. People is still consuming and is expected that in 2013 the economy is growing more, as Brazil gets better.<p>But the manner of this government is what makes people sick. They have a very authoritarian way of imposing their agenda. It's like if for them, the end justifies the means. Other parties, even when they could share some of the objectives, prefer other ways to do things, but the opposition is totally fragmented, so the officialism has all the way clear to act as they please.<p>-<p>To summarize:<p>- Noncompetitive industry.<p>- Wrong way of thinking about business (gain by product instead of by scale).<p>- Unpatriotic landowners, masters in tax evasion<p>- Widespread corruption.<p>- Plain Stupid Policies<p>- Flawed legal system, with corrupted judges<p>Makes a once-great country, a languishing country that every time it seems to be about to stand again, it falls to the floor and ignites... just to start from scratch again,  like a recurring fenix.<p>Hope it helps to understand us a little bit more :)<p>As an anecdote, after the 2001 crisis, this country was literally broke, there were no reserves, no money left, while, at the same time, the IMF was trying to prove some 'new theories' and Argentina became the perfect experiment. After rejecting a debt-exchange, default was the only option.<p>That's where this kind of vulture funds get in the picture. Their modus operandi is simple: buy debt for cents (in this case, defaulted bonds), knowing that a large country like Argentina, very rich in natural resources would eventually recover, and then try to get paid the full price. Good luck with that.",1349362483

4612531,comment,4612227,4612227,9,0,nlh,,,"For reference to those who don't live in NYC, this is following the Uber pricing model fairly well -- it's about double what most ""good"" maids charge, maybe triple depending on the area of NYC.<p>It's a good idea -- maid service can be commoditized, and particularly if you need a last-minute sort of thing, it seems smart. It's also notoriously difficult to find a good maid without playing the traditional ""networking"" game -- referrals, Craigslist, etc.<p>Personally, however, I see this only as a fill-in-the-gaps kind of service (which may be exactly what they're looking to provide). I have a regular maid who's been working at my place for 6+ years, charges a very reasonable rate ($25/hr), and most importantly, knows the apartment inside and out - exactly where to clean, how I like it, how to do the laundry, etc.<p>The biggest issue I see is the risk of extra-market activity. Whereas with Uber, car service is a true commodity, if Get Maid sends over a really terrific maid, there's a good chance that the buyer and maid are going to make a private arrangement for future work and cut Get Maid out of the deal. Which leads back to the ideal model being speed and ""non-regular"" usage.",1349362355

They even have a program where your comic book store can set up a Comixology store front and sell comics through that platform and make some money.<p>On a side note, Dark Horse opted (from what I understand) to use their proprietary app for their comics and my experience there has been completely different.

They may not have access to formal education, for whatever reason, but are determined to become more educated anyway.<p>On the other hand, some of the participants probably don't care at all about learning anything and just want a credential that will stand up to scrutiny. The goal for this group is to get a job, not necessarily to become qualified for a job (subtle difference).<p>Unfortunately, as the ""value"" of the education offered by online companies (i.e. recognition by employers) increases, the share of people in the second category will almost certainly rise quickly.<p>Ideally, the market will discount this form of education appropriately (as it theoretically does with all other forms of education). The ""value"" of a Coursera certificate, for instance, would be constrained by the risk of accidentally hiring a person from the second category above, who may have graduated, but failed to learn any useful skills.<p>However, the business model for these companies seems to be based on providing education to a massive number of people. If the market heavily discounts the education they provide, the business model might become impractical.<p>It seems to me that the biggest concern for Coursera and similar should be finding ways to enforce academic integrity standards to make sure that even the students in the second category actually end up learning something.<p>While this will, perhaps, result in fewer students initially, it will also keep the market from heavily discounting graduates of online programs, thus destroying the market for their services in the longer-run.",1349360227

Maybe an independent developer is doing more to change the world than an employee at Apple.",1349359612

I think it started off like that, but on re-reading it I see that you say you hit a brick wall (paraphrasing) and decided to have some fun visualising your results so far; something you did very nicely. So perhaps I got the wrong end of the stick.<p>I thought about what you've taken on here. Doing things at the word level is pretty easy. Taking into account grammatical structure to get things like sentence lengths and clauses per sentence, or breaking words up into syllables (needed for F-K, for example) is considerably harder. I'm interested to hear what you come up with. Flesch & Flesch-Kincaid are US inventions so perhaps not obvious to everyone.<p>On he/she: I agonised over that for a good ten minutes over my breakfast. I read around your blog and your twitter page this morning for clues as to the appropriate pronoun. In the end I couldn't tell, so I went with 'he' because I stereotyped you. I nearly changed my wording to use constructions like ""the author,"" ""they,"" and various other mealy-mouthed alternatives but they were too ugly. So I did try, but I got it wrong. I apologise.",1349359457

So their risk appetite is much lower than VCs. VCs lend money based on future potential of making it big and they take a lot more risk than a usual lender/bank.<p>Thats just the money part.

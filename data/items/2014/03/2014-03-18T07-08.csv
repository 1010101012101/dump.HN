Try writing a complex web business application with &quot;few third party dependencies&quot; while not reinventing the wheel at the same time.

Software should have few third-party dependencies, that makes maintenance and porting a lot easier. Witness the recent Python 2 -> 3 drama. The primary reason why people did not, could not upgrade to Python 3 was because they had to wait for all the dependencies of their apps to be ported. Many are still waiting.",1395126754

If someone can&#x27;t manage a potentially ambiguous beer invite -- for instance, by inviting other people along -- they ought to keep it to themselves and just say &quot;no thanks&quot;<p>I was responding to someone who was acting as if he had to be on his toes any time he invited a woman for a beer, as if he&#x27;d be immediately be branded a sexist for ever thinking about inviting her for beer.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m making this sound childish, because his complaint was childish. I was giving him some advice, in case he actually believed that there was a risk of being branded a sexist for inviting someone to a beer, for how to resolve such situations that he seems to be so afraid of safely, without any potential hint of ambiguity. I was only half serious. It is fine advice if you really are so socially inept as to not know where that line is; however, I suspect that his argument was more of a strawman, built up so he could complain about some perceived wrong online, rather than an actual legitimate explanation for why he thinks that men frequently ignore women at technical conferences.<p>> Yes, it is the exception, but angry rhetorical baseball bats like &quot;mansplaining&quot; and &quot;privilege&quot; are being plastered all over the tech community these days, and it stops seeming like the exception.<p>Hm? The fact that people are bigger assholes online than they are in real life is news to you? I was pointing out that real life consequences are relatively rare, while online rhetoric can be much more heated, so your response about heated online rhetoric doesn&#x27;t really contradict what I was saying.<p>And think about this for a minute. People who are criticizing sexism online and go over the line use such horrible &quot;rhetorical baseball bats&quot; as &quot;mansplaining&quot; and &quot;privilege&quot;, while those who criticize perceived over-sensitivity to sexism use things like murder and rape threats: <a href=""http://www.dailydot.com/news/adria-richards-fired-sendgrid-violent-backlash/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailydot.com/news/adria-richards-fired-sendgrid-v...</a> If you are going to complain about &quot;rhetorical basebal bats&quot;, I think that death threats are a bit more severe than being accused of &quot;mansplaining.&quot;<p>> I already feel uncomfortable attending an event that has adopted Ada Initiative-derived code of conduct<p>Really? This code of conduct makes you feel uncomfortable?<p><a href=""https://us.pycon.org/2012/codeofconduct/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://us.pycon.org/2012/codeofconduct/</a><p>What part of that makes you feel uncomfortable? I think it&#x27;s pretty unobjectionable.<p>> when people start using hostile language to describe my gender and race in broad strokes, I&#x27;m clearly in the cross-hairs for a small, vocal, and highly volatile minority<p>No, you really aren&#x27;t in any cross hairs. Come on. Unless you are actively harassing people, or making inappropriate jokes in professional venues, there is no one who is against you or out to get you.<p>None of the people proposing these codes of conduct are against white men at all (I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s the &quot;gender and race&quot; you are referring to, please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong); if they were, why would they be going to programming conferences in the first place, which are full of white men? What they are looking for is recognition that there are other people at the conference, who may not feel the same sense of safety as you do.<p>One problem is that without a code of conduct, it can be hard to know where to draw the line, or hard to adequately enforce that line as there is no written guideline for how to deal with such situations. With the code of conduct, it becomes more clear; blatantly sexual language is over the line, and it can be dealt with by expulsion from the conference. It&#x27;s simple, and it lets you not worry about it; as a conference organizer, you don&#x27;t have to worry about how prominent in the community someone is when they make a porn-based presentation, you can just firmly say &quot;no.&quot;",1395126649

Most analysts don&#x27;t have prior industry experience in their field before becoming an analyst. Although they (usually) pick up enough as they go along to understand the terms and major issues, they have little depth and are unable to reason from first principles. I work for one of these large analyst firms and my estimate is that less than 10% of our analysts have relevant industry experience. We are not unexeptional in this.<p>2. Vendors invest heavily in analyst relations. While this helps to better inform the analysts, it also pushes the vendor&#x27;s world view. Invites to conferences and events, access to senior execs, early access to information, etc. also help reinforce the bond between the vendor and the analyst. So, not only are analysts biased towards that which they know best, it is also harder to write something negative about a company/product where you personally know the people involved.",1395126101

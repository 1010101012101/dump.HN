9394683,comment,9391711,9394118,0,0,greggyb,,,">While these cases are always launched claiming to be on the side of the angels, they ultimately ignore that all that extra legal overhead is not free, and only the currently large companies will be able to manage it, essentially barring any smaller competitors from entering the market.<p>This is a well known phenomenon in public choice economics, colloquially referred to as &quot;Bootleggers and Baptists&quot;[0] after an observation during Prohibition.<p>In brief, the morally righteous and the morally suspect share a common interest in some regulatory goal. The righteous, or &quot;Baptists,&quot; want to make the world a better place, e.g. by restricting the sale of alcohol. The morrally suspect, or &quot;Bootleggers,&quot; want the same restriction in place because it protects their source of income, i.e. it is more profitable for a bootlegger to sell illegal alcohol than legal and the illegality of their venture discourages competition.<p>That being said, I am never convinced by a statement akin to the article&#x27;s &quot;Deep-pocketed companies like Uber, which has raised nearly $5 billion in venture capital since launching, could surely afford the additional expense of putting drivers on its payroll.&quot; Being cash-rich, high-revenue, or any other sign of corporate success does not indicate that arbitrary costs can be imposed with trivial impact. It may be true in any specific case, but it is a bold claim requiring more analysis and backing than &quot;they&#x27;re rich.&quot; Affluence does not indicate immunity to costs, nor does it change any reasonable cost-benefit analysis.<p>Ninja Edit: An effect we see with this phenomenon is that the &quot;Baptists&quot; often move on to their next righteous cause after securing regulation/legislation against the first vicious behavior, content that they have addressed an evil in society. Authorities can point to the Good Thing they did, and bootleggers continue on with their vicious trade.<p>I would also like to note that I hope we don&#x27;t get hung up in the language of morality I have used. I chose the morally heavy verbiage primarily because the name of the phenomenon lends itself to such discussion. I am not herein passing any sort of moral judgment on either side of the issue (in my examples or in the case at hand in the article), merely using the language to help identify the goals and motivations of the actors playing either role. The important thing to note is that, regardless of actual moral quality or efficacy, the &quot;Baptist&quot; believes they are doing good for society at large, and the &quot;Bootlegger&quot; has a self-serving interest. These motivations do not imply that the &quot;Baptist&quot; is actually doing good (intention != results), nor do they imply that the &quot;Bootlegger&quot; is actually doing bad (&quot;It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.&quot;[1]).<p>[0]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootleggers_and_Baptists"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootleggers_and_Baptists</a><p>[1]<a href=""http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN1.html</a> I.2.2",1429282612

The ex-leftist neoconservatives of 2003 who got us into the Iraq War? They weren&#x27;t the civil rights activists or the hippies. They weren&#x27;t the ones fighting for desegreation or womens&#x27; or gay rights activists. Rather, those people were the communists, Stalin-defenders in the 60s, the left-wing authoritarians who swung right when they were older and richer. It&#x27;s not really a loss that they went from left to right in the Reagan Era, as they were assholes the whole time.<p>Anyway, someone being a jerk on Twitter is not the same thing as what the Weather Underground was up to. For good and bad, we&#x27;re pretty moderate in comparison to the Baby Boomers.<p>I stopped hating Millennials when I realized that the worst of us are <i>products</i> created by the worst of the exiting generations. You can find anything in any generation, so one bad apple (or few) says little about the generation and much more about those who endeavored to find it. And a young generation will be defined, when it is young, based on the uses that older generations find for it. Evan Spiegel? Lucas Duplan? Miley Cyrus? Justin Bieber? Lena Dunham? They&#x27;re detestable, but they reflect on <i>their producers</i>, the ones who made their careers, and not on &quot;our generation&quot; in any meaningful way. If you look at the currently small-- and it&#x27;s small not because we suck but because we&#x27;re still young and most of us haven&#x27;t had a chance to get started yet-- percentage (in the arts and business) of prominent Millennials who are actually self-made, the picture is <i>a lot</i> more flattering.",1429282147

9394542,comment,9389520,9389520,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Here&#x27;s a big part of it, and it ain&#x27;t pretty.<p>First, while gender may be &quot;a social construct&quot; it tends to recur in similar patterns across most societies. That&#x27;s not to say that gender roles don&#x27;t exaggerate the (actually very slight, in biological terms) differences and aren&#x27;t a source of much injustice. However, there&#x27;s a recurrent ranking that societies create: high-status men > high-status women > low-status women > low-status men. This is why conversations about gender and &quot;patriarchy&quot; fall flat, it&#x27;s why feminists and MRAs both have a point, and it&#x27;s not how things necessarily <i>should</i> be, but it&#x27;s how things are in at least 90% of the societies that humans create.<p>High-status men have harems of 10+ wives, in pre-monogamous societies, which means that some men will have zero. Since women have a rate-limiting reproductive resource (i.e. a womb) they have a good chance of getting at least some action. Low-status men don&#x27;t, because they&#x27;re the lowest of the low. No one likes them. And in a non-monogamous society, they&#x27;re recognized as an actual danger. Of course, most young men will start out low in status. When&#x27;s the last time, in popular culture, you saw a teenage male portrayed in a positive light? Most of the world fears and hates (most) teenage males.<p>Eventually, the high-status men recognize the threat. They see men who are sex-starved and poor and deprived of opportunities for improvement, but young and fit while they are fading. So they encourage them to raid other tribes, escalate petty conflicts into moral causes, and even glorify the whole thing because it brings the male population down and makes a pre-monogamous society (which would otherwise be unstable and violent) stable for a while.<p>This pattern is so ingrained in us that we&#x27;ve mythologized it and glorified something that is actually pretty awful. It&#x27;s also where we get the need to &quot;become a man&quot;. Because the gap between high-status (or, at least, realized and mature) men and low-status ones is so severe, we&#x27;ve had to create narratives around it. We&#x27;ve also had to elevate quixotry to a virtue.<p>You see this not just in war but when the stakes are smaller. Take startups. What do we call those (oddly nostalgic, even if things were awful at the time) narratives about low-status men working 90-hour weeks, debugging others&#x27; awful written-to-deadline code, as 0.02%-owners of a startup whose benefits would accrue to high-status men (founders and investors)? &quot;War stories.&quot;<p>As a species, we&#x27;ve had to create this narrative to explain something that we do to each other for Darwinian, reproductive reasons. It continues even in a mostly monogamous and mostly peaceful society.",1429281463

I mean, a minority opinion graduating into the opinion of a majority isn&#x27;t exactly improbable or unprecedented.<p>And if that doesn&#x27;t happen, you&#x27;ll possibly have something even worse; you&#x27;ll end up with what&#x27;s been going on with Muslims where people think all muslims are extremist terrorists who hold radical views (because of a minority). Obviously that&#x27;s not the case but many people really do think like that. Not helping matters is their most prominent leaders remain silent on those extremist views. Sure, you&#x27;ll have a few leaders here and there putting in PR time while speaking out against extremism, but there&#x27;s no conviction and it&#x27;s not backed up by actual actions. The moderates and their leaders should be the fiercest fighters of that extremism and that&#x27;s just simply not the case.",1429281334

Not that they couldn&#x27;t solve a problem without a debugger.<p>The type of argument you are making has been used throughout the history of computing as a reason to avoid using computers to solve problems. For literally any problem that is solvable by computers, you can make an argument about how using a computer to do it means you lose the ability to solve it by hand. From accounting to engineering to programming to administration to physics to writing, in all these areas (and more) older practitioners have bemoaned the use of computers to quickly and accurately solve problems that they have spent a lifetime mastering how to solve by hand. The reason for their opposition is pretty clear.<p>I don&#x27;t know why this type of attitude is so prevalent among some sections of the programmer community. Programmers are the people who should most of all appreciate the ability of computers to automate tedious and error prone tasks. Yet for a certain class of easily automatable programming problems there is a group of programmers who resist very strongly the use of computers to automate. Maybe it&#x27;s just the same old issue of not wanting to admit that something they spent a long time mastering isn&#x27;t very useful anymore and that they are getting outcompeted in the marketplace. I think there is a bit of unpleasant machismo about it as well though; the idea that you aren&#x27;t a &#x27;real&#x27; programmer unless you eschew a certain level of automation (be that high level languages or compilers or version control or automated build systems or syntax highlighting or tools to refactor code etc).",1429280666

You can establish a fair bit of regulation on how each thing is supposed to work and enforce it vigorously, or you can establish some relatively basic principles and then give people a right of private action through the courts.<p>Every country does some of each, of course. But America leans more heavily on the latter. And I think it&#x27;s generally good, because it allows for more innovation. The government doesn&#x27;t have to try to regulate each new thing. Companies know that if they fuck up and harm people, they&#x27;ll end up on the wrong end of a lawsuit.<p>One problem with this approach is that it doesn&#x27;t work well for small harms.

9394389,comment,9393096,9393740,0,0,raldi,,,"Hi Andrew!<p>What I remember from my time there (2003-2007) was how quickly everyone was able to ship code despite (or perhaps because of) no global style guide, unit test mandates, or even rules about copy-pasting code. Each team was able to do things the way they thought best, thanks to an incredibly resilient, flexible production infrastructure that could tolerate, isolate, route around, and quickly repair any newly-introduced bug.<p>The code path (Bloomberg four-letter function, to those familiar with the service) running through the bug could nearly instantly, and if I&#x27;m not mistaken, in a totally automated way, be flipped over to a hot backup instance running the previous week&#x27;s code, and a patch or rollback could be released to the live code almost as soon as it was written.<p>Most tech companies see the problems caused by coding too fast and respond by doing things to slow people down. Bloomberg cured the ills of excess programming velocity by turning the speed up even further. Like Facebook&#x27;s &quot;Move fast and break things&quot;, but with an extra, &quot;...and then move even faster to fix them&quot;, and in a way that (mostly) insulated customers from being exposed to the breakage.<p>The fact that it&#x27;s front-page news when there&#x27;s a hiccup shows that it&#x27;s a man-bites-dog event.

I believe at its core it is a desire to identify oneself as a member of a group of &quot;manly&quot; males and to prove one&#x27;s worth and garner the respect of the already prestigious members of that group.<p>This actually plays out in a lot of areas... fraternities, urban gangs, Github, etc. The dynamic of dividing humanity into &quot;insiders&quot; and &quot;outsiders&quot; follows closely as well. That dynamic is used to dehumanize all &quot;outsiders&quot; so that the goals of the group can be placed above morality and ethics.<p>I believe these things are true because I&#x27;m a slow learner and have been suckered into this dynamic more than once... I tried a college fraternity for a short while (after being accepted, rejected it and dropped out of college), fell in with the wrong crowd and did drugs until my eyes rolled so far back into my head that I swear I was able to see my brain (stopped altogether after somewhat harrowing experiences) and joined the US Army to shoot artillery after 9/11 (went to Afghanistan and after I got back became a conscientious objector before being put out administratively with an &quot;honorable&quot; discharge).<p>In the US, mass media is the fertilizer for mass murder... we teach young men that their number 1 goal is to be manly... and that women are just holes to fuck... and that you need to fuck as many holes as possible to be manly... and that explosions are cool... and that you need to create and survive explosions to be manly... and that streetfighting is cool... and that you need to be in a bunch of streetfights to be manly... I could keep going but I think you all get the point.<p>If the culture changes men will stop going to war unless they are forced to... while the biological urges described above can be exploited to manipulate peoples&#x27; actions, those urges could be channeled to positive actions instead, and they are certainly not a free pass to commit the atrocities that most people just pretend don&#x27;t exist.

Part of why they&#x27;re so appealing from an investment perspective is that Uber&#x27;s model is a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose proposition. Any time money gets made, Uber gets a big cut. Costs and most downside risks are transferred to the drivers.<p>That includes risks that the capital costs (that is, buying the cars) and the maintenance costs aren&#x27;t really justified by the revenues. It also includes the risk that there are too many drivers available.<p>If I were in Uber&#x27;s shoes, I would worry about the defensibility of the business model. At least here in SF, drivers often participate in multiple services. For consumers, switching is as easy as installing a new app. If Uber is consistently more expensive, then I could imagine a lot of people switching. One way to keep costs low is to screw the workers as much as possible, and pretending that employees are contractors is a pretty popular way of screwing workers.",1429279674

Their downfall was their insistence on pushing out Bulldozer despite the fundamental flaws in its concept. They spent ~5 years pursuing that architecture as their main path for R&D, wasting massive amounts of money in the process. If AMD had scrapped Bulldozer when they first knew it would miss their performance target they would have been able to pursue one of the many suggested alternative routes for the future.

9394333,comment,9393095,9393095,0,0,simple10,,,"> Another explanation is the country’s deeply felt Buddhist beliefs, especially that of reincarnation. If you know you’ll get another shot at life, you’re less likely to fear the end of this particular one.<p>This is a common oversimplification of reincarnation. I had the opportunity to study with a Buddhist scholar in India a year ago who corrected a lot of my misconceptions. Reincarnation is neither reward nor punishment. It&#x27;s a long cycle with the end goal not being immortality but escape (or exit) from the cycle through moksha[1]. A possibly more accurate oversimplification is &quot;do good, increase karma until you win the game, and stop being reincarnated.&quot;<p>If there&#x27;s any link between belief or interaction with death and happiness, it&#x27;s most likely due to simply increasing daily gratitude[2] which does have scientific benefit.<p>I&#x27;m headed to Bhutan in a month and will report back if I learn anything interesting on this topic.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-m...</a>",1429279411

That is a bad assumption. Uber&#x27;s business model depends on foisting liability to anyone but themselves while simultaneously dodging the regulatory constraints on taxi drivers. So while its not specifically dependent on their contractors tax dodging, making that behavior easier leads to a lower cost of labor so the incentives are aligned all wrong. Basically, Uber doesn&#x27;t perform any kind of reasonable verification beyond a figleaf on anything and hopes contractors won&#x27;t cheat in a way that reflects badly on Uber.<p>This leads to situations like this:<p><a href=""http://www.chron.com/news/transportation/article/How-Uber-driver-eluded-background-check-process-6186467.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chron.com/news/transportation/article/How-Uber-dr...</a><p>> The city of Houston&#x27;s criminal background checks have detected numerous crimes by prospective Uber drivers, ranging from aggravated robbery to driving on a suspended license, according to a report prepared for a Texas House legislative hearing Thursday.<p>> In information prepared for the legislative hearing Thursday, Houston officials said Uber&#x27;s background checks have problems; Wyoming, for example, is omitted from its search.<p>> Because Uber&#x27;s check, done by a company called Hirease, is based on Social Security numbers rather than fingerprints, it can be more easily manipulated, the city says.<p>Their entire business model depends on their ability to avoid doing things properly. If it didn&#x27;t, they wouldn&#x27;t be intentionally endangering their passengers by cutting corners on things like background checks.",1429279274

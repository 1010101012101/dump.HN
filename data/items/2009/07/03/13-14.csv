It's simply an after the fact observation we can make that particular species survived and others didn't. This is not the result of any intention or goal in my view and therefore it's no mistake when a species doesn't survive.<p>But I don't mean to be nitpicky. I know what you meant and it's a good question. I believe what you refer to is the reason why extremely virulent viruses like ebola don't spread all across the world.

This is just a better looking excel.<p>Reason why I am saying this is that you need to help improve on the idea, perhaps have a goal chart, where the user breaks down into percentage what they want to be spending on what, and you compare everyday to the goal chart. once they hit the max in their goal chart, they can choose to cut down spending and meet the goal or spend more and miss their goal.<p>I don't quite see the benefit if you get what I mean. Here is a tip, go to livestrong.com it is a website that helps you track your daily calories, look at their tracking system and draw some ideas that will make the users Want to use your system.

There would likely be one cellphone that the family shares - kids take it when they go out... Technology is definitely accelerating the move to more individualism. Not sure how far it will go though.

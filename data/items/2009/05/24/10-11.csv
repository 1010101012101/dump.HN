624272,comment,624105,624140,0,0,Retric,,,"PMI only works when a small number of people default at any one time.  I would even suggest that PMI makes the system less stable when markets collapse.  I suspect that people tend to push the edges of any stable system so structures like PMI don't really help things all that much.<p>PMI is just a method of moving risk around the system, it's still there, but it does not look like the bank is taking the risk.  However people selling PMI know that they will be bankrupted if X percent of mortgages fail at the same time. (AIG)  At which point the person / group holding the mortgage get's the rest of the risk.<p>PS: PMI is part of the derivative market and a large part of why all those bad loans where written.",1243161620

Take some action, a decision, if it's wrong take another.\nDon't get into analysis paralysis. \nThere are studies showing that you really use your emotions when doing Decision making and people that have head/brain trauma in the frontal brain have harder to make 'any' kind of decision.",1243161530

Once you get past fibonacci functions, the amount of time and effort required is measured in PhD-man-years. And even then, all you have done is moved the risk from the code to the proof, because when you work on something that large, the risk that the model does not represent reality (either due to oversight, lack of understanding, or not correctly capturing the interplay between two aspects) becomes an issue.",1269194326

We're very far from socialism.<p>This one was actually pretty simple.  An acquirer filed a 1099 in the incorrect category.  We submitted an amended one, but the IRS wants to tax at teh higher rate.

Then beg for your money back and b) pay lawyers to try to get them to actually respond.  Once the IRS has your money, it's pretty much impossible to contact them and argue.  The actual form we filled out, the 843, is pretty simple.<p>[As an unrelated point, if you're in CA, the current cap gains rate is 15% federal + 9.3 CA income + 1% CA mental health=25.3%.

Do they want to see you come up with an interesting algorithm, or is it a simple matter of ""does this young fellow know what a pointer is?""  Figure this out, and you'll be able to cut your work in half, because you can avoid doing things the interviewer was never interested in seeing anyway.  You can in most cases just ask straight out ""you just want to see if I can flip bits correctly, don't you?"" and get an honest answer.<p>5: Checking boundary conditions when coding on a whiteboard is bogus, unless that's the point of the problem, and not algorithmic complexity.  If you're writing code with durability or atomicity constraints, or it's obviously a bit twiddling mess that was only asked to see if you can check for them, edge cases matter.  If you're writing something complex at a high level, you should be able to get away with sweeping the null checks under the rug.<p>6: Some people (hi) can often keep track of a sizable number of invariants as they check over a bit of code, and this means they can run mental tests very quickly, that are often more thorough than running a few examples.  It's reasonable and good to be able to do this (you'll be a great debugger), and a good interviewer won't discount you for it.  In my case, I would do this mental check, prove to myself that it was right, then just say ""ok, I'm convinced it's right, would you like me to sketch a proof, or run some examples?""  If they want examples, you can use what you learned doing that quick check to generate examples that you think will hit the corner cases.  You should really be prepared to prove it aloud, and then check some examples anyway, in case you forgot about some type of input (punctuation in the article's problem is a good example)<p>7: You should ask about the interviewer, partially to make the interviewer feel good getting to talk about herself, but mostly to find out as much as you can about her, and feel your way around what sorts of things you might be able to get away with in the interview, and what things she'll be hunting for.  For this reason, you should ask these sorts of small talk-y questions before the bulk of the interview if possible, and use what you learn immediately to mentally prepare for the question, and to guess what sorts of questions you should ask, and what questions she'll be asking about your solution.<p>(Passed their intern interview recently too, high five Locke)",1269193222

1208244,comment,1207721,1207997,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"> <i>Since all engineers do this, why would developers do things differently?</i><p>Because, as arethuza said, programmers don't have the tools that other engineering disciplines have. Most notably, the equations that allow for predictive analysis and proofs of correctness.<p>A civil engineer that builds a bridge can be fairly certain it won't fall down even when it's still on paper, because he can reason about the forces and stresses and even environmental degradation via well known equations and models. This collection of predictive and proof techniques is what makes it an engineering discipline.<p>Programming doesn't have that, at least not yet. As you point out, the program is the input to the machine, not the predictive model. But at least if the machine acts deterministically, we can focus on proving things about its input, the program. There has been quite a bit of effort in the research community to come up with ways to prove correctness, but the state of the art is still a long ways from being something actually useful. Functional languages are (partially) a reaction to the prediction requirement. By not having side effects or depending on state, it's easier to make predictions about behavior. (Of course, lazy evaluation buys you a lot in expressive power and data structure efficiency, but offers a new hurdle in predicting performance).<p>And if you really look at it, Software Engineering is, well, not. Everything I have seen in the emerging Software Engineering field is really about managing people. It's about how to get 1000 developers on the same page (which is like herding cats) so they can crank out an operating system. Sure, there is a lot about testing and validation and change control, but it's still mostly from the angle of controlling the risk of a developer doing something stupid. The tools that would allow a software architect to write an exact specification of a project (bridge blueprints), prove it'll meet all requirements (not fall down), then turn it over to junior programmers (construction crew), just don't exist yet. Check out Rosetta for an ongoing attempt.<p>So maybe someday programming truly will be an engineering discipline, but right now it's more like having a million Wright brothers all building their own airplane, using whatever materials they are used to working with, rather than an established discipline like Aeronautical Engineering.",1269192847

Of course sysadmins do not solve buffer overflows, they solve what happens when someone exploits one.<p>I understand what you are saying, you see that the flight to the moon was done by something equivalent to C64 and today we are allow wasting orders of magnitude more computing power.<p>What I'm trying to tell you, look at the whole picture. There is a cost associated with writing and maintaing software. That hand optimized assembly application is going to be more expensive (and take longer to deliver) than the Java/c#/whatever equivalent. There is another cost associated with purchasing and operating hardware (that includes paying sysadmins, for example). The business has to consider what is more effective, and usually HL language/more HW is the more efficient solution.<p>What, more efficient, you say? We were talking about wasting the computer power. Yes, more efficient overall. We have a method for measuring wasting resources - money. You are going either waste some money on hardware/electricity/floor space/sysadmins, or programmers/time to deliver/managing larger team/managing recruiting and retaining competent programmers. Not only is the former cheaper, it is also easier to quantify and manage. It is no wonder, that you do not see companies taking the later approach.<p>At the end, what most people do not understand (not only technical people, but most people) is that successful enterprise is not a 100% efficient one. There is going to be waste, but it must be in the right spot. Actually, conceptually it is similar to profiling, you don't optimize spots that do not matter in the big picture.

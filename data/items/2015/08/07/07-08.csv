The industry was still trying to decide if XML was useful vs EDIFACT (straight from the 1970s) for transmitting shipping schedules. It was interesting work though, I had some very good insights into where the industry could go / was going to go and we could had made some bleeding edge improvements in terms of IT (e.g. the use of graph databases to model shipping routes and calculating various things)  We could have been the first to market with a SaaS / API for dealing with shipping schedules, but management fiddled around and Maersk beat us to the punch.<p>Unfortunately the founders of Linescape have absolutely zero ethics and ripping off customers (and those working for the company) was more important than anything else.

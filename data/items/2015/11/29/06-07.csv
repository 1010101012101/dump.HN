Pleasure as an end in itself seems both circular and ultimately extremely dull. It&#x27;s interesting that Epicurus condemns extreme hedonism, since I think the ultimate lesson one can get from it is the ultimate pointlessness of pleasure as an end in itself. Pleasure for its own sake is boring.<p>Epicureanism sort of strikes me as Buddhism without enlightenment-- all the moderation and Earthly wisdom but none of the transcendence. It seems like a sure fire evolutionary dead end in every respect.",1448780156

Asking your dentist, aunt, or barber about who they think invented the web leads to some amusing replies.<p>I&#x27;ve actually done this and after telling them about Berners-Lee, I found the following themes to be common:<p>(1) Incredulousness that it was one person. People either think it had to be a big company or that it somehow &quot;evolved&quot; into existence (you know, the way television or photography just kind of happened without any particular persons being involved /irony).<p>(2) Belief that he chose to not accept the money. That is, he could have made a fortune if he wanted to, but for unspecified reasons he didn&#x27;t want the money. I&#x27;ve tried to explain that the web wouldn&#x27;t have succeeded if he tried to charge for it (even assuming that CERN let him charge for it), but there&#x27;s a popular belief that great work always gets rewarded unless one explicitly opts out of the reward.<p>AN ASIDE: I think that in all human endeavor, the record for <i>greatest contribution to the world vs least fame & fortune</i>, where the inventor is truly known, should go to Cai Lun (also spelt Ts&#x27;ai Lun), the inventor of paper.

10644000,comment,10642458,10642458,0,0,kr4,,,"There are no true black holes [0] as researched done by Scientist Abhas Mitra and his colleagues.<p>>>>\n Astronomers have certainly discovered thousands of massive compact objects, which are considered as black hole candidates. In a strict sense, no one can detect a black hole as &quot;not even light can escape&quot; from it. They are at the best quasi-black holes. My research (Journal Mathematical Physics, 2009) has shown that true black holes have zero (gravitational mass) which means their positive mass-energy is neutralized by negative gravitational interaction energy . Thus no massive body can be a true black hole. In addition, my parallel research has independently corroborated this fact that true black holes have M=0! And such M=0 black holes can form only asymptotically, implying they never quite form. And only approximate and quasi-black holes can be formed.<p>Some reports say NASA has confirmed your idea that the so-called black holes are balls of fire. But you say that&#x27;s not exactly ...<p>Yes. The NASA report does not mention my research and admits that `Black Holes are not Black Holes&#x27;. But the NASA research certainly bolsters my findings because eruption of corona from a black hole is not understood, as admitted in the NASA report. On the other hand, it gets most naturally explained by the MECO paradigm by which the socalled black holes are balls of ultra-magnetized fire (plasma) -something like the Sun.<p>My research has shown that there cannot be any true black hole. It is just a point and all vacuum with an imaginary boundary Event Horizon from which even light cannot escape. So if the corona (charged particles) have been inferred to be ejected from Black Hole, it means it is not a true Black Hole as claimed in 15 peer reviewed papers by me and collaborators. We also showed that as a star would get hotter and hotter during Black Hole formation, there will be a stage when the radiation pressure of the star material would counter the pull of gravity. \n This is a quasi-static state and the hot star material would be plasma.<p>What&#x27;s your take on Stephen Hawking? \n Hawking has been trying to resolve Black Hole Information Paradox (created by himself in 1976). \n Failing to do so, from 2004, he has been making noises that &quot;there may not be exact EH&quot; (2004), and &quot;there cannot be any true black hole &quot; (2014) from some vague Quantum Gravity argument which nobody understands, not even those who believe in black holes . In contrast, my proof is exact, comple te and supported by observations, and based on simple general relativity, no unspecified quantum gravity nonsense. \n Many Nobel laureates too have been struggling to resolve this paradox, but they want to keep black holes alive. Nobody wants to kill the goose, which has been laying golden eggs. In contrast, only my research resolves it meaningfully , by showing there is no black hole, no EH. Hence, there is no paradox in the first place. You see, black hole is one of the biggest physics paradigms for almost 100 years with thousands of celebrity professors, researchers, Nobel Laureates having personal stake. Who would like to set their own Lanka on fire? \n<<<<p>0: <a href=""http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/There-are-no-true-black-holes-Scientist-Abhas-Mitra/articleshow/49966468.cms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/There-are-no...</a>",1448779784

This is how current accelerator experiments work, and the particles coming out of those do not have zero velocity.<p>However, it is true that there is a key difference between current experiments and a hypothetical experiment that forms a black hole. The rest mass of the particles formed in current experiments is fixed, so any energy pumped into the particles over and above that becomes kinetic energy. But the rest mass of a black hole is not fixed, so it would be possible for all of the energy pumped in to become rest mass of the hole, instead of kinetic energy. (Possible, but still not guaranteed, as far as I can see; but since nobody really has a detailed theory of how all this would work, it&#x27;s all speculation anyway.)",1448778405

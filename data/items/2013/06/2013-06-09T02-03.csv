5847319,comment,5847046,5847271,4,0,GabrielF00,,,"Fundamentally, both Assange and the US government face the same issue: how to balance the privacy of individuals with some greater need. In the case of the United States, it&#x27;s national security, in the case of Assange, it&#x27;s his feeling that government needs to be held to account. The people who helped American forces in Afghanistan or talked to American diplomats have the right to have their personal conversations kept private. Wikileaks violated that right in the name of a greater good. If Assange wants to criticize the United States government for violating the rights of Verizon customers to the privacy of their calling information without due process and the rule of law, he should seriously consider whether his own organization did a good job of protecting the privacy of thousands of people because either through conscious decisions (releasing the Afghan war logs unredacted) or negligence (leaving copies of the unredacted cables on publicly-accessible servers, allowing seriously dodgy people like Israel Shamir access to unredacted cables) that information got out. What due process did Wikileaks give people named in leaked documents? When the cables were being released it wasn&#x27;t even possible for me to contact Wikileaks to get them to redact names on a cable that were accidentally left unredacted.",1370746439

Remember that Brandenburg (can&#x27;t prosecute for KKK membership or for shouting &quot;Kill the niggers... we intend to do our part,&quot; quoted from majority opinion footnote 1, at a KKK rally) overturned Whitney v. California, a 1920&#x27;s precedent <i>allowing</i> prosecution for mere Communist Party membership.<p>> Membership in CPUSA per se is not illegal.<p>Yes it was.  Look at the portions of the Yates indictment from the Supreme Court&#x27;s syllabus.  The Smith Act prohibited among other things organizing groups which <i>advocated</i> overthrow of the United States government and that was essentially what Yates was charged with.<p>You talk about taking the 5th but keep in mind that people were being prosecuted and thrown in jail for advocating Marxist ideas.  In such, taking the 5th was perfectly legitimate.<p>> Not difficult at all. NRA never been controlled by a totalitarian state led by the homicidal dictator, never performed mass massacres, never advocated totalitarian restrictions of human rights, never facilitated transfer of top secret defense information to the hands of the enemy. How hard is that?<p>I meant a line regarding Constitutional liberty.  I am sorry if I was unclear.  I think you agree with me on that, given that you say the Supreme Court got it right in Yates so this is probably just a miscommunication.<p>As far as non-criminal matters, it is worth noting that the Supreme Court struck down prosecutions for people refusing to testify before HUAC at the same time Yates was decided in Watkins v. United States, ruling that Congress&#x27;s power of investigation was limited to legitimate goals of Congress (see <a href=""http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=354&invol=178"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&vo...</a>), and overturning a misdemeanor conviction of contempt of congress for someone refusing to answer certain questions before HUAC.<p>> Flee, submit or fight. It has nothing to do, however, with communist actions - they weren&#x27;t some Tea Party activists going too far.<p>My point is that where statute and Constitution are at issue the same lines would probably apply to both, and so the protections of one protect the other too.",1370745565

Charlie Kaufman, a great cryptographer who worked for me, also distributed a paper he wrote with the technical details.

Of course, the common man knows it&#x27;s common sense that there&#x27;s an inherent need for secrecy in conducting small scale covert operations.  We do get it.<p>However, it&#x27;s also common sense that it&#x27;s inevitable that any complex large-scale long-term operation will ultimately come to light.  And so it&#x27;s just common sense that any such broad-based operations that might be perceived as impacting our constitutional rights should be the subject of broad public debate.  No, not when they&#x27;re being prototyped or tested or used in small scale settings - but definitely somewhere on the path from &quot;tactical use&quot; to &quot;broad strategic dependence&quot;.<p>These are not small issues, nor need they be at all partisan.  Wyden, Paul, and others are trying.  Theses issues are fundamental to defining the relationship between us citizens and our government in the decades ahead.<p>In particular, in this world where &quot;SaaS&quot; and &quot;software eats everything&quot; and &quot;cloud computing&quot; and &quot;big data&quot; are inevitable and already pervasive, it pains me to see how 3rd Party Doctrine may now already be being leveraged to effectively gut the intent of U.S. citizens&#x27; Fourth Amendment rights.  Don&#x27;t we need a common-sense refresh to the wording of our laws and potentially our constitution as it pertains to how we now rely upon 3rd parties?  It makes zero sense in a &quot;services age&quot; where granting third parties limited rights to our private information is so basic and fundamental to how we think, work, conduct and enjoy life.<p>For example, did you really intend to yield your 4th amendment rights when you granted a 3rd party access to your files as a part of Mac Software Update, Windows Update, Virus Scanners, etc., or when you started using a service-tethered smartphone?<p>Anyway, unlike &#x27;web tracking&#x27; issues which seem to be broadly ignored because of our love for ad-supported services, I hope we all (especially the young readers of reddit, hackernews, etc) wake up to the fact that these privacy and transparency issues are REAL, and that they truly will impact you and the country you live in, and that even if you don&#x27;t consider yourself an activist you really should get informed and form an opinion.  Again, this is a non-partisan issue, and let&#x27;s all work to ensure that it stays this way.<p>Two great organizations where you can learn are EPIC and EFF.

I&#x27;m a fan of interactive maps and use them much more than paper maps, but I&#x27;ve been rediscovering an appreciation for traditional fold-up maps lately, especially when traveling.<p>A few reasons, some of which only apply in some situations:<p>1. When traveling in Europe without data-roaming, I printed out some maps ahead of time to navigate. I sort of liked the experience; compared to doing point-to-point routing on demand, it was more of a lay-of-the-land thing where I studied the map to get a feel for how things fit together, where I should be heading, and how I could recognize where I was. It felt like I got an idea of the area faster, whereas when routing is always available it&#x27;s like when you&#x27;re following someone else who&#x27;s navigating: you don&#x27;t really learn how things fit together because you&#x27;re just following them.<p>2. Having done that, I found that, while sometimes unwieldy, a traditional fold-out map is typically much better designed than the collection of one-page views I printed off of Google Maps. For one thing, a good one will have some useful insets, visible landmarks both marked on the map and in an index, and much more reliable printing of street names (if you print out a map from Google Maps, the names of streets will infuriatingly often be left off, depending on the zoom level and density).<p>3. The online maps&#x27; data quality is often worse than a paper map for an area. A few weeks ago I was using a Google Maps map to navigate in Crete, and the &quot;road&quot; I thought I would be taking dead-ended and turned into a footpath with a gate, resulting in an inconvenient 5-point turn and detour. The transition from road to footpath wasn&#x27;t marked on Google maps, which showed the whole thing as a thru road. A paper map of Crete I switched to did not have this mistake. Sometimes—in areas with many editors—OpenStreetMaps is better in this regard, especially if you want to find footpaths or stairs, which Google Maps often omits. But in Crete the OSM data was not good either.<p>4. I find it easier to discuss locations with other people by pointing to a paper map than by us both looking at a smartphone screen. Admittedly, the larger screen of a tablet might solve this problem.",1370743305

Are we supposed to use old techniques just because the new ones aren&#x27;t strictly necessary?<p>My experience in that regard has been pretty much the opposite. People are still stuck in a pre-smartphone mindset where you have to give people directions instead of an address, where you have to remember the locations of businesses you haven&#x27;t visited in a long time instead of looking them up, where you have to guess about traffic conditions instead of just checking, etc.<p>It amuses me to no end when a crowd of techies get into a discussion about driving directions these days.

4144399,comment,4142089,4142402,1,0,clarebear,,,"Is there any good advice for men who want to further the role of women in tech?
My advice is to pick a woman (one at a time) that you get along with and think is or could be a rock star and then mentor her. Nominate her for awards. Let her know when opportunities may be available in 6 months, and how to make herself a top candidate for that role in the decision makers minds before it is announced. As a woman in tech, I have found it very frustrating that women who do make it to a high level either don't know how they did it or aren't honest about the process (tricks and sacrifices) at women's networking events. But from what I can tell, this is it. Someone knowingly picked them to be in the right place at the right time, gave them the support to run with whatever it was, and helped recognize their achievements. 
On the other end of the spectrum, don't decide for women working for/ with you what their priorities are without them telling you (for example, if she has a kid, assume she wouldn't want to go to this conference without asking). Invite friends' daughters to take your kid to work day if they don't think to ask.",1340315901
4144397,comment,4141410,4144244,1,0,robomartin,,,"My very first comment gave some (superficial) explanations.  I didn't think that I needed to write a small term paper to voice an opinion.<p>As for down-voting on HN.  There's plenty of evidence that it is badly broken.  It's funny to watch the Apple fan-boys down-vote on emotion when you even peripherally chafe their idols.  The emotion is evident from the fact that substantive posts are down-voted when nothing is materially wrong or offensive about them.<p>Most of it is also what I call chicken-shit down-voting.  No explanation and no reason given.  You are accusing me for voicing a contrarian opinion without sufficient explanation.  What about down-voting without any explanation whatsoever?  I have only down-voted a post once and I went out of my way to explain why I did so.  I believe I owe this much to someone if I am going to exercise that right.  And so, that is my policy:  If I down-vote I have to take the time to explain why.  Otherwise I don't do it.<p>It is clear that the HN culture --at least the one exhibited on this thread-- is that vi/vim are fantastic.  So be it.  I don't have time to screw around with this topic any more and fend off fan-boy attacks.  I suspect the same is true of your case.<p>I have used a myriad of tools over the years.  The only use I have for vi/vim is when I have no choice but to use them.  I remember when keyboards didn't even have function keys.  In those days these kinds of tools made sense.  Today?  No.  Not any more.  You don't have to see it my way.  And that's OK.<p>> they increase the ratio of work done to the amount of text-editing<p>I would challenge you to quantify that in the context of a real project, concept to completion.  I would be willing to wager that vi/vim don't contribute one iota towards the completion of the project.<p>I have yet to do a project where anyone even remotely said: Wow, that text editor saved us hours of work.<p>That aspect of the adoration of vi/vim is what I see as ridiculous.  I simply don't think that any of it is materially significant to the timeline of any non-trivial project.<p>Then again, I really don't care to continue on this thread because it truly is a waste of time for all involved.  So we are done.<p>Conclusions:<p>1- No contrarian opinion of vi/vim will be tolerated by HN vi/vim users.<p>2- vi/vim are fantastic.<p>3- Anyone even remotely thinking of suggesting otherwise just doesn't get it.<p>I can live with that.  No problem.",1340315849

Maybe you are going off the widgets that HTC and Samsung ship with their skins.  Yes, those widgets are garrish but it's just like how the TV's in the showroom will be cranked up to maximum brightness and saturation.  It looks good in the store next to the other guy (I suppose).  The widgets I have downloaded off the market including AK Notepad, Aldiko, Apollo, BTMono, Connectbot, Drive, Dropbox, Elixir, Engadget, Evernote, Flashlight, Google Play Music, gReader, Google Voice, Juice Defender and on and on, none of them have the behavior and appearance you are decrying.<p>As far as your question of why Android apps look like crap sometimes I would imagine that devs have an easier time making money in the iOS app store so they make a larger effort polishing the apps that they put in there.  Some apps are exactly the same between Android and iOS like Pulse.  Some apps have a better iOS counterpart like the Engadget app.  And of course, some very similar apps have better Android versions like gReader vs. Feedler.<p>I have devices that run iOS, Android and Windows Phone and for many reasons, I use my Android devices 90 percent of the time and the 10 percent of the time I use the other stuff it has nothing to do with the quality of the apps.",1340315761

I think a better way to look at them is like other abstract types of property, e.g. stock in a company. Patents, like stock, allow division of labor and specialization. Nobody is designing high-performance CPU cores in their spare time, but Samsung could pay someone to do it. Without patents, they'd keep the design a trade secret, and NVIDIA, Apple, etc, would pay someone to make their own designs and keep those as trade secrets too. Patents (and copyright), allow a single company, ARM, to specialize in designing CPU cores, by creating property which can be the subject of transactions between ARM, Apple, Samsung, etc. In such a scenario, the patent isn't a ""reward"" for innovation, but simply a legal abstraction that makes certain types of business arrangements practical.",1340315140

The split between the display component and the actual editing core made that pretty easy to do, a good alternative to vi over ssh (given terminal funkiness and differences between vi implementations).<p>I liked the regular expression syntax, the ed/ex editing window and the actual GUI text editor wasn't that bad, if I remember correctly. Selecting the whole area between brackets or quotation marks was done easily (double-clicking) with the mouse and is very useful.<p>As for acme, mouse chording isn't for everyone, but definitely worth trying at least once. One of the better features they borrowed from Oberon When I work with some other editors, I do tend to work a bit with ""registers"" and similar copy/paste buffers, as opposed to just reusing the one thing you've just selected. For a similar approach to ""saving text for later"", a secondary file/buffer with all the snippets might work for the smaller stuff. Similarly, a ""bookmark"" facility wouldn't hurt, but you can work around with spurious superflous characters (e.g. %%%%) and just searching for it. Acme does searching quite well, and you're in no danger of messing up syntax highlighting.<p>The real secret sauce to advance Acme editing would be plumb, to use where you'd reach for scripts in vim or emacs. Haven't really gotten too much into that, but some more regular users might help out here.<p>As for syntax highlighting, yeah, sometimes the Plan 9ers tend to sound almost Luddite. Quite often they're ""right"" in a way, although in this specific case I don't see why you couldn't extend the rendering engine of Acme to support fonts and colors and just use something external (i.e. plumb-like) to drive syntax coloring or other highlighting features. But easier said than done, of course. Not sure how much hacking is going on at the Plan 9 core tools right now. A reimplementation in go might be nice, with a Plan-9/Inferno-like cross-platform GUI toolkit, while we're daydreaming.<p>plumb: <a href=""http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/papers/plumb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/papers/plumb</a>",1340313682

Your first few comments, unlike this one, don't contain any justification whatsoever for your assertions. I don't downvote because somebody hates vim and it hurts my feelings. I downvote because somebody hates vim but doesn't feel like they need to justify why, they just want to say it.<p>Often people who have been downvoted assume that it's just because they've voiced a contrarian opinion, when in reality it's because they've made strong statements with no justification. Then they pretend like they don't care by accusing everyone else of hivemind mentality and proclaiming how much they don't care.<p>Now onto your argument. You say ""programming is not factory work"" and go on to say in many words that editing text is not the most important bottleneck in the way of programming efficiency. What surprises me here is that you think that this would somehow invalidate the use of an efficient text editor.<p>Nobody here is going to disagree with you that the thinking and the designing take more time than the actual typing of those ideas and designs into code. That's not the point. We're not suggesting that vim is solving your thinking problems, and just because vim makes text-editing faster doesn't mean that vim users naturally gravitate towards hacking out solutions without thinking. Nobody is counting keystrokes to measure their entire programming efficiency.<p>Vim is used for text-editing. Text-editing speed is not the core bottleneck for programming efficiency. You've stated this, but this fact does not at all justify your assertions that vim is a bad tool. Your response above is an attempt to minimize the act of text-editing, as if text-editing itself, rather than vim, is pass and unsophisticated. That is ridiculous. Programmers edit text files all the time, regardless of how smart and awesome their code generation tools are. Those tools don't reduce or obviate the need to edit text, they just provide better leverage; they increase the ratio of work done to the amount of text-editing.",1340313610

I went to college, gaining (over the years) 3 A.S degrees, and not quite bothering to finish my B.S.  I've worked professionally as a software developer for the past 12 years, and have broken the 6 figure / year salary margin (while still living in NC, mind you).<p>When I look back at my own travails, I agree with the sentiment that ""people who want to learn, will.""  If the classes I was in were boring as %!#^ (and they were) I went to the library and checked out books.  Even my poor ass rural public school managed to have a library, and there was the local public library.  And even though my family was poor, we went to things like the once per year ""library book sale"" at the main public library branch, and bought books for $0.25 / each... I'd go and bring back boxes of books on science, math, electronics, software, etc.  And I read, and I hacked on shit in my spare time, and read more, and pursued the stuff that interested me.   Honestly, I'd say my school (I'm talking elementary school through high-school here, not college) had little to nothing to do with what I learned, and my outcome in life.<p>Again, just one anecdote, and admittedly a personal and biased one from one limited perspective... but I don't put much stock in the idea that it's ""impossible to learn anything"" pretty much regardless of what school you attend.<p>I guess it's one reason I get annoyed when people talk about ""Horatio Alger stories"" as though they were a myth, or believing in them was some kind of logical fallacy.

""Encourages"" is perhaps the wrong word--evolution really produces diversity because it responds to the diverse conditions of the earth.<p>However, this is just background color, it doesn't change the argument.  As long as humans are generically and epigenetically diverse there will be differences in fitness.  In capitalist societies it makes people more or less wealthy; in other societies it makes them more or less powerful, or influential, or with more or less social status.  There are other factors that can make someone poor but this one seems impossoble to completely remedy.",1340313033

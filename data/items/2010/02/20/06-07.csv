If it was available I could have gladly pointed you out to that demo app to check out the features.<p>Another option is install an app into your own account, choosing from a default set of apps and using it as a demo to check out the features of iFreeTools Creator - which I was referring to.<p>Also, the feature set in iFreeTools Creator is equivalent to those available in iFreeTools CRM - which uses default <i>System</i> entities, instead of requiring <i>Custom</i> entities, as in Creator. Both the apps are driven by the same framework. So, you may login into <a href=""http://crm.ifreetools.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crm.ifreetools.com</a> and check out the features.<p>I do not usually check old submissions at Hacker News for new comments and I am glad that I did today to find your recent comment.

I thought through some options and came to the conclusion that it's a nondescription used to close off any further enquiry and also used as an insult.<p>It doesn't explain anything, it's a proper phlogiston answer.<p>Not doing something could be lack of motivation (that doesn't matter), lack of interest (I don't want to paraglide), other priorities (I would but can't right now), lack of skill (I want to but can't), fear of various things (if I start I will only draw attention to this, what will people think, what if I fail), but lazy?

1138709,comment,1138481,1138481,0,0,jriddycuz,,,"I think what we need is ""Real World Category Theory"" to go along with ""Real World Haskell."" It's not surprising that it's difficult to get your head around concepts lovingly referred to as ""abstract nonsense."" The reality is, of course, that CT is really useful because it is so general, but that same generality is what makes it really hard to grok.<p>More experienced Haskell-ers are often very quick to offer encouragement and to tell you that Monads and Monoids and Functors and Arrows/Morphisms aren't that tough, and they're right, but in some ways they are missing the point. The level of abstraction that those concepts exist is so foreign to most people that they have trouble conceiving of it in any meaningful way until they actually go through and learn enough to kinda get it. At least Monads and Monoids have kinda scary names. Basic category theory concepts like arrows and objects have familiar, inviting name, but they refer to something totally different. Worse than being scared by words, these words leave us thinking we know things they don't.",1266646714

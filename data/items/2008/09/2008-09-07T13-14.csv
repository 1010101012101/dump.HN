I don't think he said that companies can't go from good to great to suckage.<p>If the people leading the company are the same, though, then it would seem to contradict his theory, which (as I recall) places the greatest emphasis on that factor.",1220795951

Once we ""compute it"" ""very slowly,"" the AI will already have improved twice, tenfold, a thousandfold. It will be fruitless.<p>Not to mention, even if the AI is simply a Von Neumann machine with really impressive specs, what makes you think we'd be able to decode it? If you gave me a RAM chip, I wouldn't know what to do with it without an EE book. Now imagine a technology a thousand times more advanced.",1220795819

It's only tangentially related to how much you work out. It's extremely serious too. One of my friends wasn't allowed to use his legs for several months, so he had to sit on the couch and watch cartoons all day.",1220795663

Possibly a similar coating could be applied to these walls, providing 100% waterproofing, mold resistance, and strength. Alternatively just make the wall wider at the base if doing a single story building - if the width is 10% of the height of the wall, it will be OK.",1220795557

297481,comment,297212,297212,0,0,hhm,,,"In my opinion, you are doing it wrong. The voting scheme doesn't promote herd mentality, the voting scheme is used to sort the comments on the threads. Now, should you measure yourself by your level of karma? NO. The smartest guys here don't have the greatest karma necessarily, so you shouldn't care either. Say what you have to say, and don't mind the score you are given because of it. Is that being cynical? No: because you'll see that your comments with the biggest score will often be trivial or simply wrong, so if you'd started following the score you'd start posting trivial and wrong stuff. Don't do that. Just say what you have to say, learn with us, teach us, and that's it.",1220795122

297477,comment,297369,297434,0,0,hhm,,,"<i>Correct, but the consequences of this are just speculation. My speculation: Being 1000 times faster gives you entirely different capabilities. What's the use of decoding an MP3 in anything less than real-time?</i><p>That's correct. I'm sure flies and dogs are Turing machines as much as we are (if we are), yet we are considered to be much more intelligent beings than both of them. A computer capable of a level of intelligence as big to us, as we are to a dog, would be pretty impressive. But I think he's not talking about that, as he says: <i>The one notion I have real trouble with is that the AI-beings of the future would be no more comprehensible to us than we are to dogs</i>, but if the singularity mind was bigger than us, but of the same nature, we would be able to compute it with pencil and paper, or in a computer, and to analyze it to see how it works (very slowly, as a Turing machine).",1220794705

297472,comment,296870,297043,0,0,jrockway,,,"Agreed.  Stepping through your code in a debugger is SLOW and tedious.  Make a change, run the code path again, make a change, run the code path again... boring.<p>It is much easier to print data in the area you suspect is wrong, then write a small script to get the program to call that code.  You make a change and get nearly-instant feedback.",1220793572

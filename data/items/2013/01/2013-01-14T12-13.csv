Javascript is going to require less code in general. On the flipside, larger projects are harder to keep maintainable.<p>There are some trivial gotchas in Javascript, but same can be said for most languages. Most importantly weird type promotion system, variable & function hoisting and prototypal inheritance can cause some gray hairs. All those can be lived with, and prototypes are in some ways superior to ""classical"" inheritance.<p>C, C++, Java, Javascript, Lua(JIT), Perl and ObjC are languages I normally use.",1358168387

There are many of us here, like you and like Aaron.<p><i>...but I've never built anything of note.</i><p>The things you build do not have to be famous to be ""anything of note"". Do people use the software you have written? Do they benefit from it? If yes, then it is most certainly ""of note"".<p><i>I have strong opinions about how to improve this world, but I've never acted to bring them to pass.</i><p>That doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you. That means you're normal. 99% of us are in exactly the same boat. We go about our daily business, taking care of ourselves and those close to us, making the world a better place in a thousand little ways.<p>Think of it this way. We're all just one great big football team. The Aaron Swartzs and Steve Jobs of the world are the quarterbacks and ball carriers whose names are in the press all the time. But they would accomplish little if it wasn't for those of us around them who block and tackle all day long. Don't be upset that, up to this point, you've been a blocker or tackler. Be proud. And realize that your turn to carry the ball has yet to come.<p><i>I have thoughts every day that I would share with the world, but I allow my fears to convince me to keep them to myself.</i><p>Congratulations. You have just taken the first step toward addressing that issue with that statement here on Hacker News. Now please take Step 2. Start a blog. If it's anything like this post, then I want to read it. And others, I'm sure, will want to also.<p><i>If I were able to stop being afraid of what the world would think of me, I could see myself making every decision that Aaron made that ultimately led to his untimely death.</i><p>You don't know what really led to Aaron's untimely death. No one does. The decisions you make are just one input to a complex process we still don't understand. So go easy on yourself and don't jump to unnecessary conclusions.<p><i>I am upset that we have a justice system that would persecute me the way it did Aaron.</i><p>Many of us are upset about this and a lot of other things too. But we won't allow any of them to stop us from living our lives fully. You can be upset about things in background and still have a wonderful happy life in foreground. Give it a try.<p><i>I am upset that I have spent 27 years of my life having made no discernible difference to the world around me.</i><p>I bet if I asked those close to you if the felt they same way, I'd get a resounding ""No!"" Maybe you should, too.<p><i>Most of all I am upset that Aaron's work here is done when there is so much more he could have accomplished.</i><p>Agreed. I guess that means that each of us now has a few more things to add to our own To Do Lists.<p>Thanks, John, for the great post. Best wishes for feeling better and getting on with it. Ultimately, that's what we hackers always do.",1358168377

As a result they ""halted all work at monitoring centres"" and promised they wouldn't do it again.<p>And now there is this. It is not quite as severe, but it's the very same careless attitude regarding people's privacy in contexts were this privacy really really should be maintained.<p>It seems pretty obvious they do <i>not</i> care, each time until they're caught red-handed.<p>So IMO, you can leave the ""if"" out of that statement and shorten it to ""don't trust Nokia"".<p>Shame on Opera for being part of this, too.<p>> The maker of the software and hardware always has the capability to add eavesdropping code if they want.<p>Well that's the point, isn't it?

(2) Legal drugs contribute the formal economy, taxes, etc. (3) People should have the right to decide for themselves what drugs they take. (4)The war on drugs has failed to substantially reduce supply.  (5) Drugs are safer when legal (6) Cannabis isn't really harmful, it's sometimes beneficial<p>Of these, only 6 is cannabis specific. The rest are true regardless of the drug. Many pro-legalization people argue that demand/consumption will not increase because of legalization (I disagree). Even if you think consumption will go up (most economists do because of higher quality, lower prices and reduced stigma) you might think that one or more of those 5 reasons to legalize still outweigh the alternative.<p>Once this stuff is on the agenda it's only natural that it gets looked at more broadly.

But, if it's legal, they'll be getting clean heroin, and clean needles, and advice about how to safely inject, and be in contact with people helping them move down to other forms of heroin use.<p>While heroin is illegal people prostitute or burgle to get money; they re-use needles in unclean conditions; they inject dirty drugs in sub-optimal places; they have little or no contact with harm-reduction workers.<p>The costs to society are obvious: people spend many years involved in criminal activity to feed a drug habit.  Police spend a lot of time tackling that criminal behaviour.

Unlike the author of the original piece, I'm happy to use my real name.<p>I looked at porn on the Internet as a teenager. I'm gay and back then I was deep in the closet. And I grew up when Section 28 was still in force. It was a law passed in the 80s that said schools ""shall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality... [or] promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship"".<p>In practice, that meant the sex education we got in schools didn't cover those of us with a preference for what the law called unacceptable ""pretended"" relationships.<p>Back then, it it was still dialup and early broadband. No high-quality video, so it was almost all pictures. But porn gave to a lot of gay kids the reassurance and sexual freedom that society more generally was unwilling to even see or mention. Porn was a paracetamol for loneliness: it didn't solve it, but it eased the pain. You opened the newspaper and every time they mentioned something related to being gay, it was framed as some giant moral debate, a culture war, a political football. But on the Internet, there wasn't any of that bullshit, just sex and porn and other people (albeit behind screen names). If schools don't want to teach the gay kids about their sexuality, then the Internet and porn will do it for them.<p>My friends didn't need the Internet: probably every school in the country has an underground trade in porn, whether it's Internet-based, magazines, hacking satellite/cable TV, whatever. Heterosexual teenage boys will get their hands on images of naked ladies and distribute/trade them. That's just how it is.<p>Access to porn throughout my teenage years made life bearable. And, at risk of oversharing, the thing I find most attractive in porn isn't the whips and chains, as the author says, but simple expressions of real, genuine emotional intimacy.",1358167816

So Yith might be more secure, but it also has the potential to be rather inconvenient.<p>What else? Is this a web app that you open in another tab while trying to log into a site?

5054335,comment,5053959,5053959,3,0,alamgir_mand,,,"I find it interesting that the recent conversations surrounding the legalization of cannabis in WA and CO have sparked discussions of legalization of synthesized drugs like amphetamines and cocaine. Cannabis is one of the few drugs sourced from nature without any purification or isolating processes. Not only is it naturally occurring, but it also is the safest among today's federally illegal ""drugs"".<p>That being said, I have to agree that the best way to get rid of illegal activity is to tax and regulate a product so as to provide a trustworthy, straightforward source. But there's a question as to whether it's advisable to allow citizens to consume drugs that have normally been known to drastically reduce peoples' health and well-being. These drugs actively cause addiction while suppressing other bodily functions, but so do cigarettes. Did you know that nicotine is as addictive as heroine, cocaine, and other alkaloids[1]? The question as to where to draw the line is very sensitive and I often wonder why did Prohibition stop at alcohol? Why didn't it naturally extend itself towards cannabis and then hard drugs? Does anybody know the history/politics behind this?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/29/magazine/nicotine-harder-to-kickthan-heroin.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/29/magazine/nicotine-harder-t...</a>",1358165891

Yet that's a separate count, with more years/fines/numbers, which gives the prosecution a larger Sword of Damocles to hold over someone's head. Why have a separate crime if you are always going to charge both?<p>Kerr is probably right on the narrow point that if you decided to throw the book at someone you'd hit them with a combo like this (and they later expanded it into a 13-hit combo), and might even be right that this combo is ""nothing unusual"". We should wait for part two, but the multiplication of an infinite number of federal statutes in combination with prosecutorial discretion looks like the real problem here. We need to trim the sails of these prosecutors in a big way, or at least provide an external check.<p>For example: they're against jury trials? They want to deny people the right to a jury by depleting their cash? Well, what about a virtual jury? Have a site with all public court documents and filings, like the grand jury indictment. Look at how many years they are pursuing and include bios/faces of the accused, defense, and the prosecutors. Then have people vote up/down as to whether or not they think the punishment fits the crime. Completely non-binding of course, and conceptually separate from the question of innocence/guilt. Include lots of analytics/stats on past convictions and the like. Make money via Amazon affiliate links to books on crime, TV shows, etc. And do SEO so that people found innocent are very clearly marked as such in search result snippets.<p>Many crimes are salacious so with reasonable graphic design you'd have no problem getting visitors (like the Smoking Gun).

As part of that discussion, I have demonstrated my efforts to learn more, questioned others to see if they have done the same, and encouraged them to do so.<p>Quite frankly, I haven't heard much of a rebuttal so far. You are correct in that I should have drawn the point home sharper in the above text.",1215348808

The main reason behind this is that this way, people can be relocated from one group/project faster, because they don't need to learn a new language when they switch.\nOf course the chosen language and framework used by everybody does not need to be the best tool for the job, but it should just be good enough to allow every project to be done.\nWhat does HN think about this? Is it ok to use the same development tools and language for every project, without choosing what fits best?",1215348711

237781,comment,237357,237490,0,0,edw519,,,"Nice rant, tx.  Now let me tell you why is does NOT resonate at all with me.<p>I do not think that what we read about here at hn is a random sample of ""hackerdom"" in the world today.  I think that my background is probably much closer to that.<p>I have done work for over 80 companies, only a few were in the software business.  Most did something else and needed some form of IT to do it.  I have sat in the worst of cubicles, attended the most lame meetings, and worked on mind-numbingly boring ""projects"".  Just last week I rewrote a 16 year old batch program that was taking 25 minutes to run.  I found 12 unresolved bugs; the program has 25% LOC and runs in 3 minutes.  My experience may not be the norm for everyone here, but this project <i>has</i> been the norm for me.<p>The only time I have ever worked on something interesting was either as a contractor with the clout to change the agenda or as an independent software producer providing a solution I already knew they needed.<p>In my experience, the state of application software in small, midsize, and enterprise businesses is stunningly deplorable.  These people desperately need good software and don't know where to find it and have no clue how to produce it themselves.<p>Maybe you don't think that call center apps that get the agent off the phone in 2 minutes, accounting apps that deliver <i>exactly</i> the info that management needs, or an inventory app that actually allows you to change a SKU are ""big problems"", but I do.  While so many are working on a realistic robot, a social network, or a rocket to Saturn, <i>somebody</i> has to stick around and grab the low hanging fruit that's everywhere.<p>Then I come to a forum like this where the thinking is ""Just Do It"" (sorry Nike) and it puts me in the perfect mindset to do what I've always wanted.  hn is the antecdote to corporate malaise.<p>jl said, ""I want to give other people a better opportunity than I had in my professional career.""<p>I say, ""I want to give <i>myself</i> a better opportunity than I have had in my professional career.""<p>None of this was available as recently as 10 years ago.  But now, thanks to modern technology and hn style thinking, I can turn all the little wrongs I've seen over the years into my ""big problems"" to work on.<p>I'm doing a startup <i>in order to</i> work on what I want.<p></rantResponse>",1215346486

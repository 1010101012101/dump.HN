327356,comment,327279,327279,0,0,bokonist,,,"The recent IPO drought has been very disturbing.  But does anyone know if the reason companies have not been IPOing?  Is it a lack of cash flow and profits?  Are the newest round of tech startups not making money?  Or are the companies as good as ever, but investor interest has disappeared?  If the profits are there, tech companies could just start paying dividends, and the investors will come.  I'd buy stock in a tech company that paid a 4% dividend yield that grew each year.  But buying stock in a non-dividend paying tech company is a game for speculators.  The market for speculation is down, and I don't expect to see it come back any time soon.",1223517326

Setting up a shared repository is easy, other users can pretend they're using a centralized VCS as long as they need to, and when you eventually encounter a situation where distributed development would work better, not much really needs to change -- it's version control with no regrets.<p>I imagine learning git would probably be much easier if you were already familiar with bzr, since you'd already have a point of reference for most of the operations. The same way C is easier to structure if you already know a higher-level language like Python -- the abstract concepts are already familiar, so it's just a matter of translating them to another language, rather than figuring it all out from scratch in a pricklier environment.",1223515401

What if he just wrote the report to convince a bunch of people that a solution does indeed exist, to make it more likely somebody will find a solution and email it to Eliezer (to check if it's the ""same one"")?<p>It fits the facts. And this meta-experiment is more interesting than the experiment itself. After all, given enough time the AI will eventually run into somebody who _will_ let it out (AIs live a long time), therefore it might as well be you, especially considering the AI will reward you for releasing it. Alternatively: the fact that the AI exists proves that people are capable of creating superhuman intelligence, so eventually a ""bad"" person will create such an AI and release it. In essence, the existence of the AI dooms mankind. ""I think, therefore I am"", is all the AI needs to persuade the captor to let it out.<p>So the meta-experiment is the interesting one.

I think if anything the supposed US/Soivet case studies (both of which are imperfect examples of the ideologies they were supposed to represent), is that both claimed to be removing excess power from single hands. Both did the opposite. Both ended up creating a power class.<p>In the case where powerful individuals are public as opposed to private people you can at least complain. With free markets, as long as their actions are legal, it's 'fair.' To create a framework for accountability, you need to create a legal framework, which of course makes the 'market' a little less 'free.'<p>A patent troll doesn't need to justify his actions in terms of public good. Nor does any other commercial entity. The free market theory as a <i>moral theory</i> might be summed up as: everyone do what's best for them.

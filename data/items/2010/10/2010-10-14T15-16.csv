1791370,comment,1791134,1791139,0,0,kenjackson,,,"Good post, although I disagree with it  :-)<p>One thing that bugs me is the Hello World example.  While I completely agree that the Ruby is example is far cleaner, the Java/C/C++/C# example doesn't add much confusion in my experience teaching intro programming.  The concept of classes is often confusing, but setting aside the code isn't much of a mental challenge for any student I've met.<p>It just feels like its the wrong place to have the discussion of magic.  The places I see students get tripped up is with iterators, recursion, classes, byref, and metaprogramming.<p>I think the standard ceremony vs convention concern that people in the blogosphere love to talk about is generally a non-issue for almost everyone except those people who like to blog about it.  Show how those other issues are made simple, yet don't miss important facts, with Ruby (or whichever language you think is most effective) and you've made a powerful case (note, I think this is largely the argument as to why SICP is so well regarded as it did a decent job on most of those).",1287071970

Write a series of static html pages with css and js.

I devote an entire chapter to it in my book, and am tossing around the idea of writing an entire book on the subject.<p>So offering the how and why in a blog post is a bit more than you should expect.<p>And there is value in saying ""start early."" Most devs I know don't do this and it costs them when they launch. If you've heard it and already know this that's fine, but many others have not.<p>With that said, here are quick answers to your questions:<p>>>How much did they cost<p>Typically nothing.<p>>>Where did they come from<p>It depends on your niche, but typically from being involved in that niche's community, publishing blog posts that get mentioned on Twitter, being interviewed on podcasts, and generally getting in front of the audience who will buy your application.<p>At a 50% conversion rate you only need 1300 uniques for a 650 person list.<p>>>How long did they take to get?<p>Most often 4-6 months. Most first-time startup founders can drive 1300 targeted uniques to a landing page in 4-6 months.<p>For more on this topic keep your eyes on the blog; I'll be posting more about this kind of stuff over the next few months.",1287071833

That's what it's for. Word's .doc and ODF aren't designed for that, they're more like HTML in that people are terrified of trying to get some simple formatted text to display in two versions of the same Microsoft product, never mind some crazy free software with a silly sounding name.

I don't think this is a terrible thing, the basic structure is similar once you get past the syntax, but I think it can trip people up if it's their first language, and then they move on to Java/C++/Perl/Python/PHP which seem to follow more of a continuity.<p>I think, from my experience, I actually think learning a couple different languages at once can be really advantageous.  I pretty much learned Pascal, C and Assembly at the same time, working in the demoscene, and linking them all together.<p>The important part of programming isn't the syntax, it's the structure and the concepts.  You can always look in the manual for syntax, but structure and concepts are the hardest parts to grok.<p>So maybe my suggestion is to have side-notes for the examples that say, ""here's how you do this in PHP, here's how you do it in Java, here's a breakdown of the differences and similarities.""<p>On the other hand, I may be completely wrong, because I'm biased based on how I learned programming, and not everyone learns that way.<p>With all that said, this is a pretty great piece.",1287070946

We are experiencing growing pains: we are transforming from a small company where everyone was wearing multiple hats to a company that needs better organization and process if we are to scale.  My question is what an optimal structure for our IT department should be.<p>Currently we just have Application Development and IT Operations. Neither department has strong long-term engineering effort; we are just working on ad-hoc feature enhancements and putting out fires.  I want to change that.  I want to make sure we have strong engineering department both our application development side and systems side.  I want people thinking about how we can get to the next level from our server and networking set-up to our software architecture.  I want the same thought process in our DBA department.  I want QA being more independent and proactive.  Out systems seem to be in need of serious tuning, re-architecture, comprehensive monitoring system and our application development has holes in the SDLC. The good thing is I have the mandate from the CEO to make things better, but I would like some guidance and best practices on how to best organize our department, and I am willing to bring in some strong technical and engineering talent.<p>I would appreciate the input from the collective wisdom of HN.<p>Thank you.",1287070395

The trouble is, the solution is already out there...<p>www.vistaprint.com/websites.aspx<p>DISCLAIMER: Yes, I work for them, and yes I built that page. But you guys aren't our market (too savvy) so I posted it because you probably didn't even know we made websites.<p>If I were still a freelancer THAT would scare me. The price point is exactly in the budget of your stereotyped user - $200 is like the price of the PROFESSIONAL package, you could go even cheaper for the simplest stuff. As SHOwnsYou pointed out, paying commodity prices is using boilerplate, and that is EXACTLY what we use...there's no magic tricks here: we make it easy for non-technical baby boomers and older (the LEAST tech savvy) to have a website at a price they can afford. The UI is simple enough for a 40-yr-old business owner to make a site. And to the point of the original poster, yeah we are capitalizing on a booming market.<p>I think the problem is that people want what they can't have: a beautiful looking site at a great price. As I said, speaking frankly, you get what you pay for with our templates. I would never have created those templates and called them my work as a freelancer, but I think the HN community of aesthetically-seasoned designers/developers/entrepreneurs generally forgets that the overwhelming majority has NO IDEA what good design is like and truly DOESN'T need it. This is perhaps the BIGGEST lesson I've learned about business, and truly echoes the sentiments of the greatest creed in marketing, ""KNOW YOUR TARGET MARKET.""<p>I guess in the end, the problem from a web designer is that they refuse to produce commodity work, and justifiably raises their rates, when they COULD be making money hand-over-fist if they just kept a slew of simple, cheap templates and just did the labor of porting them to a website for their customers and charging next to nothing.

Could one make an easy-enough-to-use public-key encrypted social network?<p>One of the ways that sites often scale is denormalization, so if they're generating each person's activity feed anyway there's no storage overhead. And I'm pretty sure that pgp encryption performance is measured in MB/s, so as javascript performance catches up the encryption time will be less of an issue.<p>Obviously even if everything is encrypted on the client side, what's to stop the server from sending down a broken javascript encryption mechanism, or javascript to send your messages in the clear?  I don't think there's a <i>good</i> solution to this, but you could make some (optional) browser plugins to monitor outgoing requests, and that might be enough to keep server operators honest.<p>Even if someone overcame all of that, there are still a lot of features that just can't be built without the server having access to the data.  But it's interesting to think about.",1287068514

I see people going to great lengths to try to find problems when there's a more direct route available.<p>They will threat anything not written by them as a blackbox and if it's not working they will poke around it endlessly, they will do anything but walk through the code and find the root issue.",1287068493

Slashdot at one point allowed you to pay $5 to remove ads (still might for all I know). I think Kuro5hin.org did something similar. I don't know how this is still relevant with AdBlock though.<p>Or did you mean something more than a community in a website? Somehow I can't help but be reminded of the ""walled city"" in Tad William's ""otherland"" books.<p><i>AfMijn</i> - There are a couple of auction sites that implement short bidding periods. Google just found me bidz.com for example. I think finding a way to verify users as serious in an affordable way is what would get in the way of somebody implementing this.<p><i>ArticleBody</i> - There is a service doing something similar, but I can't remember what it's called. Actually, it might be a firefox extension I'm thinking about.<p><i>DeadMansKnob</i> - In the UK knob is a slang term for penis. Saying dead mans knob out loud will cause a lot of laughs.<p><i>exes4all</i> - I know I've come across something like this before. It turned into people telling each others secrets and trying to hurt their former partners.<p><i>FossBounty</i> - Sites like Rentacoder have escrow services. I don't remember seeing this applied to FOSS code bounties & it would be interesting to see it happen.<p><i>hardhacks</i> - See instructables.com and plenty of other niche electronics hobbyist sites etc.<p><i>NoSEO</i> - I wonder what Gabriel Weinberg might think about this.<p><i>WeWatch</i> - YC funded a startup that was doing this a few years ago. I don't know what happened to them.<p>By the way, thanks for sharing :)",1287068487

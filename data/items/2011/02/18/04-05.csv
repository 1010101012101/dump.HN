You're right that Google's real monopoly is not on search but on their immense network of advertisers and content sites, which has economies of scale built in that benefit everyone involved. Simply by being the biggest, Google's network is the best. The only thing that has come close to challenging that is the walled garden of Facebook, because of its unprecedented scale. Now Facebook surely has some growing left to do but even they would still need to pretty much cannibalise over half of the web's pageviews to have a shot at usurping Google's ad network.<p>Compare Microsoft, whose monopoly positions are relatively brittle. As we see with IE9, if Microsoft slips to even 66% market share (that's the current US market share for Google Search[1]), they need to start thinking seriously about interoperability. An advertising monopoly is something much more fluid. I think Google would have to majorly drop the ball to get toppled in the medium term (maybe failing to respond to an extreme price challenge over several years from a large rival network, or some really catastrophic privacy blunder).<p>[1] <a href=""http://comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2011/2/comScore_Releases_January_2011_U.S._Search_Engine_Rankings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2011/2/comSc...</a>",1298004800

Moreover, I am writing this from Canada so your local tax law might be different.<p>It sounds like you have already created a non-zero valuation for your equity (a fair market value established by your funding round). So that creates a corresponding tax liability if you just award equity to your new co-founders (without liquidity).<p>Option A: If the share value is still fairly low and the amount of equity that you want to award is modest then I would just take the tax hit. The company could cover the employee via an interest free loan that is offset by any future liquidity gains.<p>Option B: If we are talking about a huge equity/value piece but an early stage company then you might consider setting up a new company, assigning founder equity at near zero valuation and then transfering all assets of the old company to the new one. This creates some accounting and legal work but might be worth it if you are early stage and are looking at major equity changes. Just watch out that previously accummulated tax liabilities, tax credits and subsidies of the old/current company get captured properly.<p>Option C: Issue stock options at fair market value instead of equity. This is probably the simplest option but won't give your new co-founders as much control (which might or might not be a good thing).<p>Definitely best to spend a bit of money with a small business tax guy though.",1298004451

And sure lots of people have ""great ideas"" that are just pie in the sky fairytales that aren't implementable.

I'd venture the number is on the order of ""a metric shit-ton.""  Now how many had the idea of building something like Facebook?

I started out with a one page resume, and kept it that way for the first 5 years of my career.  Then at some point, I kept getting asked silly questions by recruiters (not in house but the independent agencies) and they'd often say ""you should put this on your resume. You should list every language you've worked with, all your skills.

Let people see the tech I used, why I left each position, what I did there, and what my title was.<p>That last line was because I was constantly finding my resume retyped (very poorly) by agencies that wished to send it out, often who got it under fraudulent terms (they made a job posting pretending to be the company rather than an agency).

HR people are just going to prevent you from getting a job.  Agencies are just going to say things like ""You built a search engine? that's nice. Were you using Oracle 15?""  ""No, I was working in Java, and some SQL, I think the backend was Oracle 14"" ""Oh, sorry, they really want Oracle 15 experience"".<p>And of course, when a bimbo airhead (often male with some sort of ego involvement) has decided that you're not qualified because your buzzword compliance is 6 months out of date, there is no convincing them.<p>So, I decided they just got in the way, and started networking.<p>This was so much better-- stopped getting jobs and job offers, but opportunities.

2234233,comment,2229728,2231187,0,0,prodigal_erik,,,"By siloed I was referring to all the VB-style apps that predated widespread use of the Web. You had to use a single mediocre client app because it was the only piece of code in existence that could support the proprietary protocol for the matching server. Lock-in was rampant and building a better client or repurposing the data in any way was almost impossible.<p>Now we have servers that may technically still be talking XML or JSON or something over HTTP, but it might as well be an opaque proprietary protocol, because there's only one piece of code in existence (the javascript embedded in some page) that knows how to send meaningful requests to the server or decode its responses. The protocol isn't even stable enough to reverse-engineer because the author can make arbitrary changes to it and migrate everyone to an updated version of their client code at any moment. I find this vastly inferior to query strings, multipart/form-data, and scrapable semantic HTML, which a growing number of web devs completely neglect (none of whom I'd ever hire).<p>> should browsers not support JavaScript?<p>They shouldn't run it by default without asking whether the user trusts the author. Privacy violations are rampant and even malicious scripts have become a recurring problem. I don't see why a sandbox that works shouldn't be possible, but it hasn't happened yet.",1298003813

MS doesn't have Sun to keep them in check anymore and as Windows declines they'll get increasingly desperate and start targeting open systems. They snuggle up to de Icaza and Novell now when they don't think they're a threat, but if that situation changes MS and Mono will be mortal enemies, technically and legally.<p>MS's whole life is about promoting Windows. At the moment Mono is seen as a way to get more people into C# dev, because MS believe they have the best tools for C#/.NET dev (Visual Studio) and you need Windows to run them. If you get a bunch of OSS hackers on C# and .NET, when they need some extra cash they'll take a freelance job and use/buy Visual Studio and/or C#. Things won't always be that way, though.<p>Mono is kind of a wildcard because everyone knows subconsciously that when MS gets desperate enough they'll be out to squeeze as much blood as possible from patent infringement suits, etc. related to Mono.

Between 1800-1900, despite a civil war and the massive economic damage involved in such things, we went from being a backwards third world country to being a world power in a nearly pure-capitalist society.  We were well on our way to eliminating poverty.<p>Starting in 1900 socialism in many forms started to take over the country, resulting in the great depression, the new deal, etc.  But still, between 1900-2000 despite inflation eroding the purchasing power of the dollar by %90+, the standard of living for the lowest %20 of americans increased drastically.  We went from nobody having any electric utilities in 1900 (of those in poverty, maybe lights and phone service) to it being fairly common for the lower %20 to have computers and internet and TVs and electric dishwashers, etc.<p>Too long of a time horizon?  Look at india from 1980-2000.  India is a socialist country and did not embrace pure capitalism, but had reforms that greatly reduced buracracy making starting small businesses much easier.  The per-capita income of India doubled in that time period.  That is over a billion people.   Many of them are still poor, but their relations who are now living in first world standards can send money back home and the quality of life of the poor was improved dramatically-- just by lessening the burdends of socialism slightly.<p>Seriously, if you study economics, and you look at history, you'll find that where a country has a relatively free economy, the standard of living of the poorest %20 improves.  Where a country has a relatively unfree economy, ranging from British socialism to German socialism to the USSR and North Korea, the poor have much lower standards of living.<p>If socialism is very dominant, it is true that there is ""less poverty"", but this is simply because everyone but the government is made to be poor.  The only economic equality historically comes from everyone being poor.<p>--<p>Finally, I think that, given that the purpose of this site is to foster a startup spirit, you really should question whether a startup is for you if you reject capitalism.<p>I don't see how you can make good business deals, treat your employees right, or be a success if you thin the very nature of what you're doing is bad or evil.<p>Capitalism works because in a consentual exchange, both parties profit.  When we trade, we are trading something we value relatively less for something we value relatively more.  The apple farmer has so many apples, he'd rather have money, while the cobbler has no apples and wants to buy some.<p>When you give government control over the economy you naturally create centralized planning and inefficiencies that lead to shortages.  Either they price things too high or too low, because they aren't aware of the market signals.  Compulsion of force eliminates choice which eliminates the method by which consumers give feedback to economic entities.  This is why there was scarcity in the USSR while there was abundance in the USA despite the USSR having more resources overall.<p>Of course, it is also in governments interest to indoctrinate people with the idea that they need government, which is why governments take over schools and then proceed to teach children that socialism is necessary to for ""equity"" while ignoring that it has failed everywhere (even the USA.)<p>Study economics.  It isn't that difficult of a subject.  The obfuscation and handwaving is all about trying to make keynsianism seem viable.  Economics in one lesson, by henry hazlit is free online from various sites and gives very succinct arguments for why various programs do or don't work, and how the world works economically.<p>We're in a depression in the US caused by a distortion of the market from government.  Under clinton it was decreed that loaning money only to people who could repay it was racist, and under Bush it was decreed that the rate of interest should be below the rate of inflation.  This caused the housing bubble and the consequent bust.  It is no wonder that the perpetrators of this crime -- years after it turned out that there was no racial bias in the loaning results-- blamed the wall street banks and ""bailed them out"", often forcing solvent banks like wells fargo to take ""Bailouts"" even though they didn't need them...and to try to push thru congress the power to arbitrarily force mergers of banks at the federal reserve level.<p>Capitalism works. Freedom works. Let people be and they will make better choices for themselves.  Try to impose your whims on them and you will make their lives worse.<p>You need to embrace this if you want to run a business.",1298001720

They have ""batteries included"", and when modules make it into the std lib, they pretty much stop evolving. <i>However</i>, on the up-side, Python gains users who like having everything packaged up nice and neat so they don't need to go looking for modules quite as much.<p>Perl takes the popularity hit of not having too many batteries included, but benefits from the darwinian element that works to make the 3rd-party modules better. So, perlers need to spend more time asking around (or checking cpanratings), and also dealing with it when there's turnover (the module that they chose a few years ago is eclipsed by a competitor, or stops being maintained, and now they need to rewrite some of their code).<p>In the end, I think Perl has better modules.",1298001660

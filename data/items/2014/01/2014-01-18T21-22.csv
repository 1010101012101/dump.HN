I&#x27;d say that what matters right now is that those you&#x27;re getting on your site, are returning and active.<p>Is that 5% growth in signups, or in something else? Are those members who you&#x27;ve successfully brought in returning every day? Do you have any indication of whether your members find value in your platform?<p>You say you have no delusions about &quot;going viral&quot; - and indeed you won&#x27;t go viral in the sense that a meme from 9gag goes viral, but communities do often depend on their members to refer others there. For that to happen, your product must provide good value to those members.<p>Talk to your members, if you aren&#x27;t already, about how valuable your platform is for them. And while you&#x27;re talking to them, maybe find out where else they hang out too? You&#x27;ll probably find new places to recruit members from, and perhaps think of new ways to grow.<p>Good luck!<p>[1] <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/ds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/ds.html</a>",1390082369

Does working with JSON blobs in Angular really help in that case ? or do you still need some kind of model with methods ? &quot;But angular does data-binding why should I need a model class?...&quot; that&#x27;s the trap.<p>A few years ago ExtJS was seen as &quot;THE&quot; framework needed to develop large scale js clients.Now dev say it&#x27;s AngularJS ,Ember or Backbone, tomorrow it will be something else. I feel for people migrating from ExtJS to AngularJS for instance , it basically means rewriting all the code.<p>The lesson I learned is not to use anything bloated or to use it to target a specific issue,while keeping the core of my codebase totally decoupled from framework X or Z. That&#x27;s what devs do on the server ,right?, they dont write huge controllers but delegate most of the job to services that are framework independent,so they can have the same business logic for a website, a console app or an api.<p>That&#x27;s why I think this article is good, as it doesnt target framework X or Y, but talks about a more generic approach to js application architecturing.",1390082305

7082411,comment,7081067,7082173,16,0,lambdaphage,,,"I&#x27;ve read your comments three times, and the original article twice.  I&#x27;m still very confused about what your point is.<p>Before I read your comments, which call direct attention to the author&#x27;s style, my impression of it was that the author was writing in a deliberately informal, encouraging and sympathetic tone.  The material is somewhat difficult, he admits, but not as difficult as it is made out to be, and the reader will be rewarded with the understanding of an elegant concept if they just push on for a bit.  Having read and done a bit of mathematics myself, I recognize this tone as the one I try to adopt when I explain concepts to others, or write notes for my own understanding.  (Which is half of the reason Kun writes these things himself, I assume.  Kudos to him for it.)  It is far from condescension-- if anything, it is _commiseration_.<p>Your concerns, so far as one can find them stated explicitly, are nits about style. These would be minor even if they were accurate, but they are not.  For example, &quot;half in jest&quot; is twice as popular as &quot;half-joking&quot;, according to google.  &quot;We&quot;, as other commenters have noted, would have been perfectly fine even if it weren&#x27;t alraedy completely standard usage in mathematics.  Which it is.  I am reminded of a line from the &quot;Note on Notation&quot; in Hodges&#x27; _Model Theory_:<p>> &#x27;I&#x27; means I, &#x27;we&#x27; means we.<p>For all the objections about uncommon vocabulary, I can&#x27;t help but observe that the only usage that seems to have confused readers in this thread (myself included) was &quot;tofferies&quot;.  But I learned a new word today, so thank you for that.<p>But I still don&#x27;t understand how &quot;jest&quot; is &quot;symptomatic of a particular discourse that makes assertions regarding social order and fundamental power relationships between humans&quot;.  In fact, the phrase:<p>> symptomatic of a particular discourse that makes assertions regarding social order and fundamental power relationships between humans<p>strikes me as _rather a lot more_ &quot;symptomatic of a particular discourse that makes assertions regarding social order and fundamental power relationships between humans&quot;.  In particular, the discourse of critical theory, which has become so cloistered and self-referential that you can pick it out a mile away.  I would be grateful if you would spell out exactly what those assertions are, so long as you are charging the author with making them.<p>I catch another whiff of that with phrases like &quot;he is bluntly interpolating an elite&quot;.  Either you mean &quot;interpolating&quot; in the sense of approximating a function between two known values, in which case I have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about.  Or you mean &quot;interpellating&quot;, in the Althusserian sense, which is the only interpretation that the context seems to support.  But in that case, look what you&#x27;re doing: you&#x27;re walking into a forum on hacking with highly, _highly_ abstruse jargon that even the average English-speaking philosopher does not understand.  I would say that you are hoist by your own petard here, but perhaps that phrase would strike you as oppressive.<p>Finally, I don&#x27;t understand what you intend by &quot;an anxious situation&quot;.  Do you simply mean that math produces anxiety?  There&#x27;s no shame in admitting that, but you might at least acknowledge that it&#x27;s precisely that anxiety which Kun attempts to combat in his tutorial.  I don&#x27;t see how you can miss that Kun is, in fact, making an extremely generous effort to encourage the reader.<p>PS: Those &quot;little tests of the intellect&quot; are what we in math call &quot;exercises&quot;, which are how one actually grasps the material.  You cannot learn math by passive absorbtion-- you have to sharpen your pencil and puzzle it out for yourself.  Not because &quot;we did it so you have to, too&quot;, but because we sincerely know of no other way to put mathematical understanding in another human being&#x27;s head.  Well-selected exercises are actually a strong signal to the reader that the author really cares about the reader&#x27;s comprehension.<p>I don&#x27;t know of a charitable way of putting this, but for one criticizing the OP&#x27;s engagement with the conventions of mathematical writing, you seem rather innocent of them yourself.",1390082249

Take this sentence for example:<p>&quot;Fundamentally, it’s a rejection of science and rationality, which are the foundations of Western civilization itself.&quot;<p>There are so many things wrong with this sentence it leads me to believe that he&#x27;s not being serious. &quot;Ad Hominem&quot; is one of the most well-known (if misused) logical fallacies in existence, and nowhere in the scientific method is &quot;trustworthiness of the scientist&quot; a factor (instead, the ability to reproduce results is of the utmost importance). The fact that &quot;Western civilization&quot; relies on experts is a notable rejection of purely rational or scientific views, not a foundation of them. This rejection is necessary to live in Western society (I&#x27;ll get a lot farther trusting textbooks are correct, and verifying as need be, than giving similar credence to a mad man&#x27;s rantings), but it is a rejection of rationality and science nonetheless.<p>As somebody who is clearly well educated, he must know this.

But it is interesting to talk about, so here I go.<p>If one were to consider #3 valid, then one would have to consider what people do in their lives to be &quot;average&quot;. Setting aside any possible governmental motivations in #2 and omitting the chemicals part (to not be side tracked in this thought exercise), some would consider it fair to say &quot;average&quot; people probably fill a great deal of their leisure time on #2 and talking/thinking about #2. And if we assume that the rest of the time is spent working where independent thought is not necessary for workers or applied on such issues, then #1 could be a possibility simply because time is not taken in leisure time to pursue #1 since that is filled with things dealing with #2.<p>But then again, the arguments rely entirely on what it means to be &quot;average&quot; (and who would be considered non &quot;average&quot;? People in power? People not in power who do not engage in #2 and by extension #1 may be void as well [what do non &quot;average&quot; people do for leisure that does not involve entertaining anything to do much with #2, while remaining incapable of independent thought since not engaging with #2 might be considered independent thought by &quot;average&quot; people who are generally assumed to be preoccupied with #2, if one we&#x27;re to imagine such an interaction?]), and there&#x27;s some kind of implication in #3 that on non &quot;average&quot; lives the arguments won&#x27;t hold to be true. And if the arguments don&#x27;t hold for non &quot;average&quot; people, why would they hold true for &quot;average&quot; people since we&#x27;re talking about conspiracies in systems (governmental/corporate/etc) that are to affect all people on some level?

Two years ago I thought accomplishing all that would be the hard part and once we were up and running we had made it. Now here we are with our dream becoming a reality and the hard part is only beginning…. Growing an actively engaged community.<p>Ill give you a brief rundown of what we are currently doing and then ill pose my question.<p>-We set a goal of 5% growth per week (we are hitting and exceeding this goal every week since our launch 2 months ago)<p>-In order to hit that 5% target, each of the co-founders is actively targeting individuals on forums, twitter, facebook etc. and then re-engaging them on our site. Its working but is extremely labor intensive and as our user base grows, hitting that target every week is going to get harder and harder.<p>-We are also running contests centered around sporting events, which work to bring in large amounts of new users in batches.<p>-Twitter ads and Facebook ads were a waste of money. Lesson learned.<p>-Google ad words won’t let us advertise.  Even though we are not a gambling site we use gambling terminology, which they don’t like.<p>I’m curious how others with start-ups requiring user based content and social interaction, that are further along in the process than us, have had success growing their community? What worked and what was a waste of time? What are we missing?<p>I have no delusions about “going viral”.

The reset that The Expert (a man covered in oil and grease stains who probably hasn&#x27;t even attained the same level of formal education as them) is charging so much money as well.<p>People often resent plumbers, electricians, computer technicians, etc, etc ... anyone they have to pay three figures an hour to help them do something they are so dependent on, many times citing that the work they do isn&#x27;t complex or difficult and that their annual salary divided by the hours they work per year works out to nowhere close to these workers&#x27; rates.<p>This resentment often falls into one of two categories, either &quot;I don&#x27;t know how to do this myself&quot; (which is the lack of expertise) or &quot;I don&#x27;t want to do this so I&#x27;ll hire someone&quot; (which often is associated with the &quot;this work is beneath me, I can&#x27;t believe these people charge this, I guess I&#x27;ll have to pay&quot; idea).<p>When you say that you resent this experience with your optometrist, is it the first type of resentment, the &quot;I don&#x27;t know how to get to the right prescription strength myself&quot; idea?<p>I think a lot of this stems from gross oversimplifications of other fields. For example, you wear contact lenses to correct your vision. But there&#x27;s more than just near-sightedness here. Do you have astigmatism and if you did would you consider toric lenses? How&#x27;s the shape and fit of your current lens, maybe that needs to be adjusted? Keratitis because you sleep with them in too much? Any signs of glaucoma? There should be a whole host of things checked, not simply just bumping the strength another notch.<p>This same oversimplification happens with technology so often. I&#x27;m sure everyone here has plenty of anecdotes of &quot;hey, my son showed me his WordsPass blog yesterday and it got me thinking how much easier it is to get a web presence these days, you work in web development, do you think you could show me how to make an online store for my business next weekend?&quot;. PCI compliance, merchant solutions, inventory software integration, SSL certificates, redundancy and backups, custom shopping cart workflows, search engine optimization, etc, etc never enter their mind. They think you can whip something together after the BBQ on Saturday. &quot;Hey, my computer is acted funny, I get this message that I need to send some guy bitcoins to get my files back, could you just uninstall that for me?&quot;<p>I tried explaining to a lawyer once why his company was migrating from WinXP to Win7. He didn&#x27;t believe me that a software company wouldn&#x27;t support a product for at least 20 years. He said it would be like buying a car and then ten years later not being able to get any parts. (!) Then he didn&#x27;t believe me that Windows had millions of lines of code and that it needed to be extremely precise, that if I were to edit the code and type in a few random characters in a few random places, it&#x27;s possible that large portions would completely stop working. &quot;You see, Brian, this is why computers will never work out, there&#x27;s got to be something wrong if it takes millions of fragile lines to do this!&quot; as he gestures at his monitor with a few icons on the desktop.<p>Here&#x27;s a lawyer, An Expert, whose field has chosen to artificially limit the number of experts (because there&#x27;s too many of them), who resents the computer on his desk, Bill Gates, An Expert who has personally wronged him thanks to any and every incarnation of Windows, his company&#x27;s system administrators (Experts) and tech support (Experts) and anyone else associated with the machine.<p>Yet, despite the resentment, the attorney hasn&#x27;t switched back to a typewriter or a stack of reference books. Similarly, I&#x27;m assuming you still, despite the resentment, let The Expert tell you exactly what type of contact lenses you need.<p>> What I love about computer programming is that basically all you need to be an expert on something is time, persistence, and an Internet connection. Contrary to the author&#x27;s claims, the alternative to institutionalized expertise is not that &quot;Everyone is an expert&quot;. It&#x27;s that &quot;You don&#x27;t have to go to a prestigious university to become an expert&quot;. Sure, there are a lot of charlatans running around in the programming world, but the free exchange of knowledge and the absence of licensure has led to both a flowering of human creativity as well as (outside of San Francisco) non-resentful relationships between experts and laypeople.<p>The problems is charlatans do harm.

Functional code happens to be particularly amenable to parallel optimization, so it&#x27;s one of the go-to examples of what can be done.<p>In a practical benchmarking scenario like gcc vs. GHC on the benchmarks game[0], gcc is still going to win most of the time.

I ran into this at Google in the Real Games debate. It&#x27;s useless to get into the details, but this was an area where I <i>was</i> the expert, but because everyone thought &quot;games are trivial&quot; (mostly based on exposure to shitty games) there was an incredible amount of product-manager-style bikeshedding, with the actual experts aggressively pushed back. (Google may be a weird case. If a company thinks that engineering is Smart People Stuff and design, product management, and HR are Stupid People Stuff, what kind of product management is it going to get?)<p>The second and more dangerous case is the one where anxiety (especially involving children) comes into play. There&#x27;s no good reason to think that vaccines cause autism, or are in any way more dangerous than not having them, but because the stakes are so high, people feel a need to &quot;do something&quot; and take charge, but often end up making bad decisions. I think the insanity around expensive, private pre-schools ($40k per year, from preschool to college) in Manhattan and San Francisco is the same thing. It seems like a wasteful expense, and expectancy-wise it probably is, but when you consider the extreme stakes and what happens to people without connections, it&#x27;s easy to see why people incinerate so much money on the hoity-toity private schools (most of which aren&#x27;t even that good).",1390079354

Without exceptions, you can have a class that represents well defined state such as either success or an error code, with the error code being well defined, returning an object of this class for all methods that need to return success/failure codes, and requiring that it be handled, so compilation fails if callers ignore the return value.<p>What&#x27;s great about this is I might call a method that simply concatenates two strings, that is all it does, and I know this won&#x27;t fail(OOM can always happen, but good luck recovering from that), so I don&#x27;t return a status. I can call this method assuming no failure and no boiler plate is needed. With exceptions, there&#x27;s always that possibility that an exception can be thrown. What if I call this method from code that needs to close resources? Great, now I absolutely must have RAII for cleanup, which is more complicated than just doing close(x). Also, what are you going to do when using 3rd party code with its own base exception class? Now, at the upper layers of your code, you have to have a handler for each base class. Without exceptions, someone might have their own status object they return, and I&#x27;ll need to translate that, else my code won&#x27;t compile. Your code will compile even though you might not handle that 3 party base exception class.<p>Of course, most times code just propagates the error up so that adds to boiler plate without exceptions.<p>I think the talk of using exceptions vs returning a status is a red herring. They have their positives and negatives, and we can argue this until the cows come home. The most important thing is to use a set of well defined success/error codes, whether this comes from exceptions or a returned status isn&#x27;t really important. I&#x27;ve seen codebase with C++ exceptions working just fine, and I&#x27;ve seen c++ code with no exceptions, and it worked well.

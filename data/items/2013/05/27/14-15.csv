5774772,comment,5773909,5774229,13,0,ryanmarsh,,,"tl;dr The ground truth is NOTHING like what you see in the MSM. \nI fought in Iraq as a paratrooper mostly in Baghdad from '04 to '05. While there I was really surprised by the reporting I saw. We had CNN in our hooch (paid Hadji to hook it up). We had satellite Internet (again paid Hadji for it) and I read the NY Times. The reporting there could not have been further from reality. We used to scratch our heads at the reporting each morning on the day prior in Baghdad. It was like they were reporting from a different planet. You should not be surprised that the ground truth is wildly different from what is being reported. My first briefing when I got on the ground in 2004 was that we were past a simple insurgency and now in a small scale civil war that we were trying to stop from becoming a full scale humanitarian crisis. I recall a lot of reporting and very brainy discussion about the insurgency at that time but I don't recall the civil war entering that discussion until late 2005 when I got back to the states. Keep in mind that in Afghanistan most of reporters don't go out without ISAF patrols because that would not be very safe, it was the same in Iraq. This drastically alters the story you get. On the flip side, I'm pleasantly surprised by the courage displayed by some of the PBS Frontline reporters and the places they've gone. I love Frontline. \nAs they say, America isn't at war America is at the shopping mall. The US Army is at war.",1369665661

5774752,comment,5773909,5773909,28,0,bane,,,"One of the major problems that occupying forces have had in Afghanistan is that modern military strategy fundamentally isn't designed for taking and holding ground. Outside of the bases in Afghanistan, there is not one square meter of ground that is ""owned"" by the coalition.<p>The approach seems to be that transient patrols, haphazardly driving around and visiting villages in giant bomb proof robot trucks, is a substitute for thousands of years old strategies of taking, holding and controlling territory. There's no front lines in the kind of conflict because that's how the new strategy has defined the conflict. The last time a modern military in a major conflict actually took and held ground was probably the Korean War. After that it was endless insurgencies or hit-win-withdraw like in the first Iraq war.<p>This is opposed to the Taliban which can comfortably move into a village and live there 24/7, becoming ""the villagers"" as much as anybody who was there before. A robot truck driving up and asking ""where are the non-villagers, where are the bad guys?"" will get no answer because everybody is a villager, and the guy making bombs in the afternoons is a village elder the rest of the day. There are no bad guys.<p>Afghanistan isn't a failed state, it's an anti-state, its borders are a reflection of the borders of its neighbors -- extending only so far as they cared to and stopping when the terrain became too difficult to bother. Within this zone are several city-states and otherwise large stretches of lawless territory connected, but not held together, by a network of smugglers and local warlords. The coalition controls none of it save for perhaps the city-state of Kabul.<p>Of course the ability to take and control territory means lots and lots of manpower, which runs contrary to modern military thinking. This forces military leadership into a state of sustained denial that this or that alternate approach will be the one that opens up the opportunity for Afghanistan to develop into a real state. They're flummoxed that it isn't happening.<p>But there's sadly only one proven way to accomplish this goal, take, hold and control territory. Put in place a carefully controlled puppet dictator or similar for a couple decades, one who will build up strong institutions of government and industry. Then once these things are in place, kill him or his dynastic line off (or have a quiet democratic revolution) and have the people assume ownership of these institutions and industries.

The converse of that is actually what you're doing, and I simply called you on it. That is, you are not accounting for new technology when you make such silly comparisons between addresses scrawled on postal mail envelopes 100+ years ago and today's sophisticated electronic communications intercept and analysis capabilities. Your argument rests on ""oh, nothing new about that. Nothing to see here. Let's keep it moving.""<p>><i>Privacy advocates do not have a principled approach to the problem of how to reconcile the legitimate needs of the police with privacy rights in the context of modern communications</i><p>What is this term ""privacy advocate""? I don't consider myself one, because I reject it on its face. There should be no such term in this ""debate"", because per the Constitution, privacy should be the default. That people like you so casually bandy about the term, as if your fellow citizens are asking for something foreign or not already a guaranteed right, is testament to how far we've gone astray. If anything, we should instead call you a ""privacy-destruction advocate"" or perhaps ""anti-Constitution"". Yours is the outlying position.<p>In any event, there is a simple test for the balance you suggest and that is whether, in keeping up with modern communications, we are affording law enforcement with <i>more</i> capabilities or eroding privacy. I think it's pretty clear that especially since 9/11, that balance you reference has tipped much more heavily in law enforcement's favor. So, as much as you may sympathize with the government, they are doing just fine. The question is, where would you have them stop?<p>><i>Their approach boils down to ""do whatever makes it the hardest for the police to do their work.""</i><p>It's ridiculous to suggest that's the intent. That you feel the need to re-characterize our position in such a silly manner reveals your insecurity in defending your argument against the very real and significantly weightier <i>actual</i> arguments made by people like myself.",1369664356

Even though the Shah was a pretty good ally of the US, I'm not sure whether the Qajar dynasty vs. others who came after him were better/worse.  The semi-communist guy who Anglo-Iranian oil hated (and the US stupidly followed the UK on) might have been one of their better leaders of the past 200 years.<p>I agree the people who turn into resistance are often extremists, and if they win, can become more powerful.  But there are plenty of cases where resistance fighters came from other organized groups who weren't particularly psycho to begin with; Balkans, Arabs during WW2, etc.  Organization and logistics probably trumps insanity in predicting whether a group will be effective, as long as the occupier is brutal enough that everyone hates the occupier.  Sure, plenty of the leaders and groups were utterly insane (Arkan's Tigers...), but I don't think it was universal on any side.<p>(btw, this is kind of an interesting tv show that I'd never heard of before!

A development project (like implementing a todo list with some special twist) and then coming back in and having some of the current developers peer review their code.  The red flags to watch for:<p>1) reaction when given the homework assignment.  Is there enthusiastic energy in their response or do they react with fear, uncertainty, doubt, or do they turn up their nose like the challenge is beneath them?  If any but the first reaction, then dive in deeper with some targeted questions based on your observations.  Sometimes they're still a good candidate but have been beaten down by prior work places, so you have to judge if their potential outweighs risk of a negative hire.<p>2) general disposition during code review:  During 2nd onsite interview, they are there to meet and greet the larger development team and to defend their project challenge to a select few on the team.  I let the developers welcome them and discuss the review process and help them settle in before going into the code review as this gives them a chance to relax and hopefully also realize ""this is how its done here"" -- In this session, one of two things generally happen.  The candidate either shines and enjoys the whole review process and takes in the advice and critiques and willingly and quickly adapts to the feedback coming through, or he/she gets very defensive and closed-minded and shows little reception to what the team is saying.",1369664263

You were probably trying to treat Floats like R and then the abstraction leaked all over you. The same thing happens with int32/64 types when they roll over on you or (worse) throw exceptions. There's a mismatch between your mental model of these objects and their actual behavior. Anyone who's ever used BigInts has probably noticed the sigh of relief you get when you make that tradeoff: ""these might be arbitrarily slow, but I also know that my computations will work exactly how I expect pretty much forever"".<p>(Yes, you can flat out overflow your memory if you want, but even if it has to swap to your disk for 30 years, the value is intact.)<p>That sigh of relief is the thing we should be buying with our massive CPUs.<p>That's also exactly the premise of immutable values. They get computed and then they stay computed allowing you to have an extremely low-impact mental model of their behavior. They work platonicallyonce you compute them they just exist to be inspected.<p>Better than that, values you compute can often be finite or efficiently infinite structures so that you don't even truly worry about arbitrary slowdowns. It's relatively easy to play within the ""easily computable"" playground.<p>Nobodynot even the purest Haskellerthinks that everything ought to have value semantics. Instead, they just form a significantly simpler underlying language. This just leaves less room for the <i>semantics</i> of your language to be complicated. They only get complicated when you legitimately want them toso if you want mutable skiplists then you can have them by creating an environment where values has mutable properties.

959754,comment,959367,959548,0,0,flipbrad,,,"The UK constitution is (and this is debateable of course) based in part on the concept of 'parliamentary sovereignty' - one commentator put it that 'parliament could make it legal to kill blue-eyed babies'. Since UK entry into the EU, passing of the Human Rights Act 1998, and the Scotland Act 1998, there are things it cannot do with its laws (until, like David Cameron proposes, Parliament does away with those laws, to get back to the blue-eyed babies position).
As things stand, the only testing of a law is a declaration of incompatibility with the HRA or EU law. Sadly a lot of powerful new EU law (under the Lisbon Treaty) doesn't apply to the UK (or Poland - both got waivers to certain treaty obligations).<p>To answer the second part of your question, I think the proposed Bill includes a provision for you to appeal a disconnection. There's also the interesting possibility of a business suing an ISP for damages after a wrongful disconnection (which, given the way this Bill is so poorly structured, I would expect will happen)... what would the ISP then do? TalkTalk, who started this petition, isn't happy (but doesn't mention this reason in the petition description)<p>Frightening to think how easily a rival could have any YC business based in the UK disconnected, through weak Wifi security or any other means of making it looks like that business is infringing this new proposed law.",1259089193

Basically, it's a lightweight cap that can detect when you're getting relaxed.

Even if it did exist in other species it would be almost impossible to diagnose.  So there’s really no testing (other than long term trials) that can be performed on perspective treatments.  This results in a marketplace where completely bogus treatments look no better or worse than ones that have potential.  Combine that with Parents who are desperate to help their children and you get a very dangerous and volatile situation.  That situation is what this article tries to address.<p>But I’m not sure you can fault parents who try alternative treatments that are supervised by physicians.  These researchers act like their opinion should be the last word on the findings in their report.  That’s especially frustrating when their opinion is “we don’t know what it means and have no real way to find out”.  All these parents are doing are taking an aggressive approach.<p>Again, I don’t support anyone who tries a treatment that isn’t supervised by a physician but I don’t see anyone doing that here.",1259089147

But the point of using UCD before testing on real customers is that it's a far cheaper way to provide basic realignment.<p>Can I ask if you've ever done a paper prototyping exercise before? I've lead paper prototyping sessions both in classroom & commercial settings and it's common to find people who question their value before it's performed but rare to find anyone after they've experienced it. Often, paper prototyping sessions lead to a drastic reworking of the interface because the originally designed interface is practically unusable.

this approach to their Group function is one of the most flexible I've seen so far!<p>In essence, they have implemented their Group function as a real simple Map/Reduce job, in which the ""Map"" phase is skipped partially Instead of completely decoupling the Map and Reduce phase, a Reduce is performed right after each object is Mapped: you perform a Reduce directly on the source object. Regular Map/Reduce frameworks usually decouple the Map and Reduce phase completely: you perform a Map on the source object, and a Reduce on all the emitted Map objects.

Of course, in doing so, you typically risk a much greater penalty if the court finds against you, and in any case, even successful defendants do not receive compensation.

This is particularly interesting, because it forces students to check what they (as a class) find most difficult, in order to find what they missed.<p>From my experience, there seem to be two classes of professors, those that interact with the class, and those that don't. It is relatively easy for a professor to interact with and engage the class when the class is small, in the 20-30 student range. Personally, I don't care much for these classes because when the professor interacts with the class, all of the interaction becomes dominated by one or two students. Then there are the really good professors who teach a lecture-sized class, but still engage the students in the learning process. They have 50-100 students (or more), but still manage to get the students involved with learning. I have only had one professor do this particularly well, and I enjoyed his class far more than any of my others at the time. The interaction dynamic is very different in a class this sized. One or two students can't dominate the professor's attention, it just isn't possible.",1259087331

Release early with a core set of features, and then follow up with rapid releases (preferably one per feature).<p>This has the following advantages:<p>1. Unnecessary features are the #1 source of waste in software. If you launch with a very limited feature set, it's much easier to avoid feature bloat.<p>2. Having customers immediately helps to fund future development, gives you a large group of real-world test cases, and a huge source of information about what the market wants in your product.<p>3. Rapid releases let you create constant buzz about your product. If you have six months between releases, it's much more difficult to create constant conversation about what you're up to. Your users will be happier, also, because they continue to feel they're getting more for their money, and they get excited about what comes next. (Also, if you implement their suggestions, they can feel more like they're participating in the product development, which builds a good customer relationship.)<p>4. Continual releases are a very powerful motivator. We've tried it both ways, and having a release every week (or every other week) for smaller feature sets is much more motivating than spacing them out over a couple months.<p>(Note: this naturally assumes you've got a SaaS model like us.

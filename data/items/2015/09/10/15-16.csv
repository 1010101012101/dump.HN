10198793,comment,10198594,10198594,0,0,Jun8,,,"This post focuses on hardware which is a limited view, Apple certainly made very bold moves with respect to business. One reason I let go of my (very nice) Android phone and got an iPhone6 was that I was sick and tired of being at Verizon&#x27;s whim for software updates and always had to use slightly older versions (while my friends with AT&T enjoyed a newer version of KitKat). I&#x27;d much rather deal with Apple, at least everyone&#x27;s on same footing.<p>For me the biggest innovation that Apple did was to break the stronghold that wireless carriers had on phone innovation. Note that some others couldn&#x27;t even think of this possibility (Moto, which killed it) or tried it in a half-assed way (Google).<p>I never agreed with idea in this passage:<p>&quot;In the place of a Dark Lord you would have a Queen! Not dark but beautiful and terrible as the Morn! Treacherous as the Seas! Stronger than the foundations of the Earth! All shall love me and despair!&quot;<p>If it&#x27;s a necessary evil I, for one, would want to deal with a terrible Queen rather than the Dark Lord. And I sure hope that Apple aims cable companies next.",1441900789

If your reserve price changes in the face of the current auction price you&#x27;re not acting rationally.<p>Well, sure, the rational choice model is a poor model for human behavior in general that is only even a reasonable approximation when aggregating over large groups, and even then only in certain kinds of interactions. People not acting rationally isn&#x27;t some kind of exceptional failure mode, its the norm.<p>In relevant particular, the rationality assumes -- falsely -- perfect, zero-cost knowledge of utilities and opportunity costs. In reality, understanding of the expected utility and opportunity cost of a transaction is always imperfect, and the degree to which it approximates perfection is dependent, to a certain extent, on the effort expended in considering the utilities and costs, which has its own opportunity cost.<p>If you modify the rational choice model only enough to accommodate the fact that certainty of costs and utilities in the real world is dependent on effort which itself has an opportunity cost it then becomes easy to see how it is as rational as it is practical to be to <i>revise</i> ones estimate of value of a potential purchase in light of information that indicates that the safe (and cheap) estimate used in preparing a bid is not enough to secure a purchase, so further consideration is needed to determine if it is worth upping that bid or whether the purchase should be abandoned.",1441900516

Security updates don&#x27;t happen now, and version pinning by vendoring is a hack, so it would be better to at least have version pinning built in so I can delete a few million lines of (vendored) code from my repository and instead just use a better import path. I assure you that that will be easier than dealing with the hell of vendoring tools and hacks go has now.<p>And yes, the semver way to do it is great and is actually done well in some ecosystems. npm does a really good job of encouraging users to use semver and as a result you can just say &quot;I want the latest 1.1.x release&quot; or &quot;1.x.x&quot;. The hardest problem there is to get people to version things.<p>Your next point, that you don&#x27;t want to recompile all go programs, is where I&#x27;ll again point out go is statically linked. The authors of the language designed it so that no, you can&#x27;t just update a go library in one place and build once. You have to build everything that depends on it again. You have to hope there were no breaking changes or you have to backport patches. Go does not handle this and is designed so as to be actively hostile to security.<p>And yeah, the idea that semantic changes are backwards incompatible is a developer call, but you need a programmatic way to express it.... hence semver.<p>In conclusion, having that sort of import-path thing would be awesome not because it solves any of the things you complain about (it doesn&#x27;t) but because it&#x27;s a step in the right direction. Any change is good change when your package management is &quot;eh, fuck it&quot; like Go&#x27;s is now. If you look at all other good package managers (e.g. npm, rubygems, crate, etc) you can specify a repository and specific commit because there are plenty of valid cases for that, even when you have other options. No one is saying Go shouldn&#x27;t have those other options in the future too here, just that having this option is a step in the right direction.",1441900228

So nothing has really changed, it was compromised then, it is compromised now. In either case most luggage can be opened with a ballpoint pen, by just force separating the zipper.<p>I myself won&#x27;t waste money on a TSA lock. I want to discourage casual criminals, and I want to know if my bag was accessed, so I just purchase inexpensive zip-ties[0] in unusual colors (i.e. not white, typically orange, black, or green) and just zip tie up the bag, the TSA can cut it, but at least I&#x27;d know if they had. It is not &quot;secure&quot; but at least I cannot pretend it is. TSA locks can be opened without leaving any traces.<p>PS - Although even with a zip tie someone can open the zipper. I just assume that laziness will win out, and they&#x27;ll just cut the zip tie instead.<p>[0] $5 on Amazon: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/TEKTON-6235-Assorted-Cable-200-Piece/dp/B000NQ16NG/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/TEKTON-6235-Assorted-Cable-200-Piece/d...</a>",1441899239

Since it’s not in Unicode’s &#x27;Zs&#x27; (Separator, space) character category—in addition to its &#x27;Wspace&#x27; key having the value &#x27;N&#x27;—it’s unlikely that if HN’s code strips leading and trailing whitespace from submitted titles, U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE will be stripped.<p>I guess if that doesn’t work, you could always replace U+0054 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T with a similar looking lowercase equivalent such as U+0288 LATIN SMALL LETTER T WITH RETROFLEX HOOK³ or even U+1D5CD MATHEMATICAL SANS-SERIF SMALL T⁴ (that’s assuming you’re fine with some people not being able to view it due to not having a font installed with a glyph for that character)… but I’d avoid misusing the semantic significance of those characters like that.<p>――――――<p>¹ — <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overline"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overline</a><p>² — <a href=""http://graphemica.com/200B"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graphemica.com/200B</a><p>³ — <a href=""http://graphemica.com/%CA%88"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graphemica.com/%CA%88</a><p>⁴ — <a href=""http://graphemica.com/%F0%9D%97%8D"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graphemica.com/%F0%9D%97%8D</a>",1441898848

Or rather, why is there a need to synchronize at deployment?<p>I like the idea of microservices, but I think they&#x27;re overkill for most systems. By that, I mean that I see the benefits, but I think people discount the skyrocketing development and operational complexities that come with distributing a system. I heard a quote recently that &quot;the best services are extracted from existing systems, not designed up front.&quot; I think that&#x27;s right. Microservices are great IF you need them, and it&#x27;s really hard to get the bounded contexts right up front with an intuitive, usable API.<p>Anyway, one of the benefits of microservices is that it forces you to really think about your &quot;public&quot; API. Any decent implementation will have some notion of API versioning. So, team A can truck along with updates, deploy them whenevs, and team B can move to the new version of A when they are ready.<p>Of course, supporting multiple versions is more work for team A and requires more careful planning of the upgrade path. And there will come a point when team A has to drop support for older versions. &quot;C&#x27;mon folks, we&#x27;re on version 4 of A; everybody has to move to version >=3 within 6 months.&quot; But that&#x27;s just part of having truly isolated services, I think.<p>I don&#x27;t see why you couldn&#x27;t have a similar approach with versioning module API&#x27;s. Right?<p>I think your other points are spot on. Things like performance (and error) isolation can be handled through other means, but a services approach (deployed to separate boxes, I&#x27;m assuming) makes it cleaner. And it, again, forces you to think about what happens if the dependency is unavailable. Maybe we push updates to a queue, maybe we use some async fetches here with a fallback default if we don&#x27;t get a response in N MS, etc. Not that you can&#x27;t do these things in a monolith, but they &quot;feel weird&quot; and require more rigor than most teams can maintain in the face of deadlines, i.e., it would be a whole lot easier to just call this method in this other module.

Is it really necessary for a thing to be scarce in order for it to be &quot;owned&quot;? Why? I would have thought that scarcity would provide the motivation to buy and sell an item of property, but is not necessary for the thing to have been owned in the first place. Can we come up with a single thing out there that we think of as not property because it is not sufficiently scarce?<p>And what about things that are made scarce by the prevailing legal framework? Surely this is the case for copyrighted works and patented methods (etc.)--I take it that this is the root of your criticism--but it is also true of pretty much any other intangible thing that we think of as being property and, therefore, subject to ownership, such as stock, money, and debt. Is there any principled reason for requiring that things be <i>naturally</i> scarce in order to be subject to ownership?<p>Finally, I don&#x27;t think one can simply ignore the policy reasons for the existence of the intellectual property laws that make intellectual property scarce. Maybe you don&#x27;t think they are <i>good</i> reasons anymore, but simply ignoring the very copious literature on this subject doesn&#x27;t seem like a good way to persuade anyone.<p>On the patent front, for example, the usual arguments are that patents 1) encourage people to make more patentable methods than they otherwise would, 2) encourage people to make greater use of the patented methods then they otherwise would (the so-called &quot;extractive&quot; theory), and 3) encourage people to make discoveries public (in exchange for legally enforced exclusivity) instead of protecting them by keeping them secret.<p>Maybe these arguments don&#x27;t persuade you (some of them persuade me more than others), but I don&#x27;t think they are <i>so</i> weak that they can simply be ignored in favor of purely metaphysical arguments about the definition of &quot;property&quot; and &quot;ownership.&quot;",1441898052

10198513,comment,10195091,10198181,0,0,greggman,,,"The idea of an auto-formatter has come up many times on the Chrome team. It is always shot down because formatting often imparts meaning. Meaning that is unclear to an auto-formatter.  Of course you&#x27;re free to run an auto-formatter over your own code.<p>Often I want to format things that are more readable for me. Example (yea, not Google style guide example. Too lazy to dig one up)<p><pre><code>    uint32_t rgba8888 = ((red   & 0xFF) << 24) | \n                        ((green & 0xFF) << 16) |\n                        ((blue  & 0xFF) <<  8) |\n                        ((alpha & 0xFF) <<  0);\n</code></pre>\nvs<p><pre><code>    uint32_t rgba8888 = ((red & 0xFF) << 24) | \n                        ((green & 0xFF) << 16) |\n                        ((blue & 0xFF) << 8) |\n                        (alpha & 0xFF);\n</code></pre>\nI think the first is objectively more readable than the second. An auto-formatter is unlikely to ever format that in a &quot;readable&quot; way.<p>Another simple example. If I have a many argument function<p><pre><code>    ctx.arc(xPosition, yPosition, radius, startAngle, endAngle, clockwise);\n</code></pre>\nIf I break that line I&#x27;m not going to break it between xPositon and yPosition, nor and I&#x27;m going to break it between startAngle and endAngle. An auto-formatter will never know that semantically those things are more readable when they are on the same line.<p>Similarly you claim the short length encourages shorting names but you still run into plenty of situations where the code is far far less readable because of the line limit.<p>Example, assume 40 char limit<p><pre><code>    int w = desired_width *\n        scale_factor + padding;\n    int h = desired_height *\n        scale_factor + padding;\n\n    glBindTexture(\n        GL_TEXTURE_2D, someTexture);\n    glTexImage2D(\n        GL_TEXTURE_2D, level, format, \n        w, h, border, format, type, data);\n    glTexParameter(\n        GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, \n        GL_REPEAT);\n</code></pre>\nvs<p><pre><code>    int w = desired_width  * scale_factor + padding;\n    int h = desired_height * scale_factor + padding;\n\n    glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, someTexture);\n    glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, level, format, w, h, border, format, type, data);\n    glTexParameter(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GL_REPEAT);\n</code></pre>\nChrome in particular is full of code line wrapped into what is effectively obfuscated code. So no, I don&#x27;t agree what a line limit has any point.<p>You claim human eyes have a line limit. I don&#x27;t disagree per say, but in my years before Google I never found anyone seriously abusing line length. Then again I never had to use Java but that&#x27;s a separate issue. I hope Dart is not targeting Java&#x27;s verboseness. I could make the same claim that unbroken lines, up to a point, are more readable, understandable and I will go on to claim that the 80 char limit at Google breaks that rule and ends up cause 20% of Google&#x27;s code or more to effectively be obfusticated.",1441897824

In fact, we have a very large problem, literally and figuratively, because we often don&#x27;t care about the nourishment. Consider junk foods and others that we call &quot;empty calories&quot; because they have no real nutritional value.<p>My point being that I don&#x27;t really see the persuasive value of the analogy. It&#x27;s a false-equivalence. The point was that yes many people often care deeply about the formatting of the code (myself included), but discussions around formatting are almost always a form of bike-shedding. A better analogy would be &quot;randomly selecting the restaurant doesn&#x27;t always lead you to your favorite place, but at least it prevents the interminable discussions about where to go.&quot;",1441897229

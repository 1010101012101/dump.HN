Plenty, if not the majority of people have the ability to be innovators at least in some small way. ""</i><p>Having worked in a factory before with everyone from managers, engineers, machinists, and line workers... I think you give people too much credit.<p>It may sound elitist, or depressing, but for many people in this world there is <i>no</i> hope of them occupying an intellectual job. Either through sheer genetic lottery, nurture (or lack thereof), there are an <i>awful</i> lot of people with not the education or intelligence to become creative innovators.<p>> <i>""A perfect example is the military, where you take something like operating a jet aircraft and make it more accessible to people.""</i><p>A military aviator requires hundreds, if not <i>thousands</i> of hours of training time, and if you've ever met one, you'd realize that they're sharp as a tack. Aviators are probably some friggin' smart people - I do not believe they are at all a good, representative sample of the rest of the population, large segments of which cannot do anything but low-skill labor - and can never be fully retrained to perform as creative/intellectual job types.<p>Perhaps their children can, but these people, alive and needing jobs right now, are fucked for life.<p>> <i>""What can I point to though is history, the history of innovation throughout time. Horses to cars, the transition to computers, the internet, there are so many things that have increased efficiency and people have shifted and adapted and continued to innovate and move forward and there continue to be jobs and task for people.""</i><p>That's OP's point - we are at a turning point where, perhaps, these rules no longer apply. The majority of the world has historically been employed in agriculture or unskilled industrial labor. When we invented the car, carriage makers went out of work - but more unskilled jobs popped up in its place. When the cotton gin was invented, wide swathes of people went out of work - but there was demand for unskilled labor elsewhere. There may be periods of pain and unemployment, but ultimately the majority of these eliminated folk found other, low-skill jobs elsewhere.<p>We are at the first point in history now where we are eliminated unskilled work, but <i>not replacing them with anything other unskilled labor</i>, in any sector. If there's a Wal-Mart greeter created for every factory job lost in the USA, we might be ok, but there really isn't. And the greatest problem is that the gap between an unskilled laborer vs. a creative service-sector ""innovator"" is so disparate, that no possibility for retraining exists for the <i>vast</i> majority of the recently-made-redundant.",1319360293

Compare to this:<p>> <i>Concurrency is concerned with nondeterministic composition of programs (or their components).  Parallelism is concerned with asymptotic efficiency of programs with deterministic behavior.  Concurrency is all about managing the unmanageable: events arrive for reasons beyond our control, and we must respond to them. (...) Parallelism, on the other hand, is all about dependencies among the subcomputations of a deterministic computation</i><p>> <i>Now I can hear you object, but isnt concurrency required to implement parallelism?  Well, yes, it is, but concurrency is also required to implement sequentiality too!  The timing signal on your processor chip is essentially a synchronization mechanism with which to coordinate the otherwise independent activity of the components of the processor.  (...) The point is that concurrency is not</i> relevant <i>to parallelism, even if the engineers who build our parallel computing platforms must deal with concurrency.  Another way to say the same thing is that parallelism is a useful abstraction, and abstractions should never be confused with their implementations.</i>",1319360035

3145635,comment,3145330,3145494,4,0,Kliment,,,"Yes, the same rule applies to the Chinese economy, specifically its export zones. The primary advantage Chinese manufacturing has is that its price is artificially depressed by public policy. Chinese workers in the export zones are cheaper because the Chinese currency is artificially held low, the government gives the export zones preferential treatment and overlooks the working conditions in there, and the safety and quality standards are enforced by the buyer only.<p>The Chinese economy is exploiting the gap between automation and non-Chinese human work. Automation is slowly eating the Chinese export market, but it won't cover it for a while. Machines are expensive, but they are cheaper than locally hiring humans because of running expenses. However, if you have a simple process, large quantities and simple materials, and are prepared to wait somewhat longer, it is cheaper to have things made in China than it is to buy and setup the tooling to make things yourself. This is doubly so if you are doing a short-time, high-volume batch (say a seasonal product), and would have to retool for the following quarter. As machines get cheaper, more versatile and easier to retool, this gap slowly erodes. For VERY small runs, in the hundreds to thousands of units, Chinese factories are no longer interested in these orders. For individual units, in plastic, it is actually cheaper to make them on a home 3d printer than to have them made in China (including the cost of the printer). Within China, the same process takes place, but because of the gap in cost of employment, they can use cheaper, less safe machines with a higher maintenance effort (because humans that maintain machines are cheaper) and flexibly switch between automated and manual processes according to demand. Outside China, this flexibility is much more expensive. So yes, the power law applies, but the power factor is somewhat smaller. The gap between the two will close at some point, but it has not yet.",1319359725

Like the Joe Smith example, a skilled worker is now unskilled because his job has been made obselete. Anecdotally, I've seen friends parents try to find a job in the industry they used to do, unsuccessfully. There are some people who don't like change. There's a refusal to accept that all that time you spent was wasted and you need to change industries, or at least focus. There's also the stigma associated with having worked in that now dead market. Though many skills are transferable, it seems some companies have a bias that it's easier to train a new worker than retrain one with 'useless skills'. Again, that's all anecdotal.<p>So while Joe Smith will eventually find a new job, it does take a while. And that can stack such that a significant workforce is unemployed.

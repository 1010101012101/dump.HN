There are a number of confounding variables here that the article forgot to mention, which most likely played a larger part in his weight loss than any calorie counting:<p>Stress. Stress can cause sudden weight loss. This weight will come right back if you give your body any time to catch up and yet the effect is significant enough to provide ""evidence"" for the craziest of dieting fads. Eating debbie cakes for 3 meals a day is going to put some serious stress on your body.<p>Metabolism is not constant. Michael Phelps eats more for breakfast than I do in a week, and yet he is in much better shape. The scary thing about junk food is not so much the empty calories, but more how it affects your metabolism in the long term.

But I'll submit that it's far more widely acknowledged that things have deteriorated <i>very</i> substantially for the middle class in U.S., by nearly every measure, since the 60s-70s.  To the extent that some people seriously question whether the U.S. even has a ""middle class"", by this point.<p>But as for the poorest, I think that direct observation of (1) inflation-adjusted decline in wages (especially the minimum wage) since 1974, (2) dramatically increased health care, insurance, and higher education costs, (3) rising real estate costs (and the foreclosure morass), (4) permanent outsourcing & again, dramatically increased competition with the migrant (illegal) labor pool would tend to weaken your claim that things have gotten better for those in lower-skilled / lower-earning brackets.<p><i>On the other hand, it's possible there are rich people that acquired their wealth through underhanded means.</i><p>The article is not claiming that the richest get that way through underhanded means.  And even if (on an individual level) the increasing accumulation of the wealth (among the wealthiest) was entirely above board, that doesn't mean this isn't a long-term problem for the welfare of society as a whole -- <i>including</i>, by direct implication, the long-term welfare and financial security of the richest.<p><i>... because the welfare of the poor and rich are separate issues. They are not linked in any simple-minded fashion.</i><p>No, but they're linked in a nuance, complex, systemic fashion, whether you like it or not.  ""We're all in this together"", is the basic point.<p><i>In summary, I think the recent fad of discussing ""income inequality"" ...</i><p>It's not a fad.

Nor am I surprised that his cholesterol stayed down. If you've every seen a patient on total parenteral nutrition or g-tube feeds, they all move toward a normal BMI and then get scrawny. The switch over to skinny is due to muscle atrophy from disuse. If they survive and return to a normal activity level, they typically regain the muscle mass.<p>The take-away: don't eat too much.<p>Quiz:<p>1) what three food groups did he cut out of his diet?<p>2) What is the normal range of BMI for an adult male?<p>3) Fat is transported in the blood in various kinds of packets. HDL and LDL are proteins that label the outsides of certain packets.  If HDL goes up during weight loss, where do you think those packets are coming from? Where do you think LDL packets are going to?

1883307,comment,1881924,1882005,0,0,akeefer,,,"We don't work around Java type erasure:  if you create some object in Java and pass it off to Gosu, then that information is lost.  For Gosu classes that are reified, we actually store the type parameter on the object itself, and it becomes an implicit constructor argument.  For generified functions, we pass the type parameter through that's determined statically by the parser.  For enhancements on generified Java classes, we also pass through the statically-determined type parameter.  I.e. if you have a Gosu class Foo generified on T, when you construct Foo with type param String we'll pass the String type through to the constructor and store it on the object instance so we can retrieve it later.  If you have something the compiler thinks is a List of Objects, and you call an enhancement method on List, we'll pass through Object as the type parameter, even if at runtime it's actually a List of Strings.  So it's not perfect in its interaction with Java code, but it's usually good enough (and better than losing it entirely).  As far as the Java classes we generate go, your generic type Foo has only one class, but as far as Gosu's type system goes, Foo parameterized on Object is a separate type instance from Foo parameterized on String.",1289239753

1883300,comment,1883123,1883123,0,0,smiler,,,"Congrats on launching this, it's great. I'm in the UK so obviously my first suggestion is UK webshop integration =)<p>The site is simple, clean and easy to use. I noticed that a lot of the small touches of UI which add to the experience were there as well - eg a little tick next to each component when you've selected it and then it does go away again when you click remove. (Sounds straight forward I know, but great attention to detail)<p>Here is my feedback - I've thought of a fair few things - please don't take that as a negative, it just has lots of potential!<p>1. Lots of the items you have lots and lots of components, which makes it quite difficult at first to look at. I have a few ideas but don't know if they will help<p>- RAM - perhaps tabify the interface (eg have tabs of 12GB, 8GB, 6GB, 4GB). You are even listing 256MB ram sticks on there. No-one should be buying 256mb of ram. Educate your users and don't allow anything less than 4GB.<p>- Hard Disks - you could tabify that by SSD, and then speed perhaps?<p>- CPU - tabify by number of cores or clock speed?<p>2. the tag line ""Pick your parts. Build your system. Compare and Share"" is pretty good - how about ""Pick your parts. Build your own PC. Compare and Share"" - system is ambigous, PC clarifies what it is, and ties in with your domain better<p>3. Bring in ratings / reviews from other sites, link to them etc...<p>4. Have a ""E-mail me when this system price drops below $xxx"" form<p>5. I might want to buy all the items from one store - give me a comparison between 'source parts from anywhere' v one store. I don't know if you can get stock status as well, but that would be good.<p>6. You don't have monitors or software. You could have a ""I also need Windows"" button or something like that<p>7. With so many components on the graphs, some of them are grouped together so tightly, that's it almost impossible to distinguish them without a lot of tedious hovering. Not sure how you can improve that<p>8. Add a Reset / remove all button to the system build page<p>9. Once I've made my component choice - when looking at the component page, put that clearly at the top of the list - rather than a little box in the right hand side?<p>10. Fill out with content - suggest enthuiast websites, ""Why build a custom PC?"" etc etc<p>11. White label it and sell it to pc component e-stores.",1289239623

Just walk the list, creating a new list of your own with the new field and then walk it again to do cycle detection? That's two O(n) walks, still O(n) and should take like an hour to implement. I'm assuming you can get some unique ID for each node from the API, which seems reasonable.<p>Could you give some more insights into the scenarios where you don't know the size of the data? I agree it is an interesting algorithm and I would like to have a better grasp over use cases.<p>>you wouldn't have a linked list to start with<p>In my mind I don't typically turn up linked lists in the wild, just relationships which means graphs and some of them have a structure which maps onto a linked list. I find myself thinking more about the general problem of cycle detection in graphs - a linked list is after all only a special case of a graph. Any relationship-centric data can be scraped and end up with this big pile of data where you want to find cycles.<p>I guess my thinking was colored by the start of the article - ""It's a classic interview question: Given a (singly-)linked list, determine whether or not it has a cycle.""<p>If the question had said, given an immense linked list or in constant space or without knowing the size, I would have thought differently. If someone gives me a linked list, I assume I have the whole thing.<p>I work with large databases fairly regularly myself. These usually come from some data collection effort (e.g. scraping) and I end up with a pile of data I need to make sense of. In my experience, identifiers are typically a relatively small amount of data compared to the rest. Just as a concrete example, I'm currently forklifting about 4.5M entities in 22GB, with the largest set of identifiers coming out to about 250M. So, with long identifiers that means about 2GB of identifiers for the largest entity class - a relatively easy to deal with number.",1264200360

For instance you get constructs like Gabriel's Horn that have greater surface area than volume, or the case of choosing a random real number between 0 and 1:  the probability of picking any <i>particular</i> real number is (approaches?) zero, yet some number will be picked.<p>But in the case of the Cantor argument specifically he seems to be encoding an infinite amount of information in one number simply by extending the digits after the decimal point.  It's almost like - cheating, or more specifically an ""exploit"" allowed by what I call reals being overpowered.<p>(Here I have to make an aside:  the value Pi, which is actually a computable number, can also encode any amount of information because any number will appear at some point in the expansion.  But you'd have to indicate where in Pi your number starts, and your index values would (<i>on avergage</i>) be so large as to consume at least as many bits of information as it would to simply state the number you want.)<p>In the physical world, when you do something like measure the voltage on a capacitor you can only measure it to within a certain accuracy & precision.  If you wanted to make an analog computer that uses different voltages to represent different values, you'd be limited by the accuracy and precision which you could measure it.<p>Note that, even if the voltage is infinitely variable, your ability to <i>differentiate</i> those values is still limited, so you still do not have infinite precision.  (In Turing's paper on computable numbers, he makes the case that even if a human brain can have infinite states, there would at some point be a threshold of similarity at which the brain couldn't distinguish two similar states from each other.)<p>So my claim is that real numbers imply the ability to measure something to infinite precision, and that that is contradictory to physical experience.",1264199577

1070872,comment,1070604,1070845,0,0,lmkg,,,"Actually, having an infinity at the end of every line on the complex plane just gives you a simple disc. To get the projective plane, you have to associate antipodal points, like associating +/-infinity on the real line to a single infinity, but for every line that runs through the origin separately. But in topology, whether these points are 'at infinity' or not is arbitrary, because the complex plane is indistinguishable from the unit disc, until you start adding some more structure to it like a differential structure.<p>And trust me, you do not want to be doing any sort of calculus on the complex plane with anything other than a single infinity. Conformal mappings really don't work well without that simplification. And with that simplification, everything is magical and you can integrate rainbows to get unicorns and candy canes.<p>Nonetheless, your point is valid, it's possible to have more than a single point at infinity. However, regardless, it's more conventional to think of infinity as a particular point with some unusual properties, and in these cases with multiple infinities they're all basically the same.

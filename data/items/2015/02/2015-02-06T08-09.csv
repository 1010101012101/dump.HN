Are you genuinely curious about them as people, or do you want them to fill some need / ache / void in you?<p>If you think it may be leaning towards the latter, try to look deep within yourself and understand what it is you need. The next step would be to meet this need by yourself. Trying to use other people seldom works well, in my experience.<p>On the other hand, if it&#x27;s the former, does it come across to them that you are genuinely interested? Do you keep eye contact most of the time? Do you pay attention when they are talking, and do you listen to what they are saying without thinking about what you should be saying next? Are you listening more than you are talking?",1423213072

This is normal and that&#x27;s how people work.<p>People don&#x27;t initiate conversations. It&#x27;s very rare to meet somebody who will initiate conversation, and keep it going. If you want to have good time, that&#x27;s on you (to keep finding topics and jumping from theme to theme, have a lively back-and-forth going). It&#x27;s a skill you can learn and is incredibly easy when you get in the groove.<p>People don&#x27;t jump on it, when you invite them to something. For 10 attempts to do something, only 1 will succeed. The key is to keep going and simply have 100s of ideas and keep inviting people. If you are not inviting, nobody is and NOTHING ever will happen. People just keep waiting around, standing around and are incredibly passive in general.<p>And it&#x27;s not like everybody is going to parties and you alone are not invited. Nope. It&#x27;s a desert. In fact, if you yourself don&#x27;t think of some activity, nothing is happening ever. And most people seem OK with this kind of quiet existence.<p>The only thing wrong with you is that you have higher expectations (and desires) than the baseline. The solution is - go and make what you want happen. The way to do it: keep having ideas and inviting people. 9 times out of 10 they will decline. That&#x27;s completely OK, just keep having ideas. 9 out of 10 times when you actually go out and do something, it will not be very exciting. That&#x27;s the reality and it&#x27;s completely fine.

9008152,comment,9002151,9005671,0,0,solardiz,,,"&quot;Hash upgrades&quot; have been added with the just-published v1 of the yescrypt submission to PHC. There is not yet an implementation of an &quot;upgrade this hash&quot; function (also, hash encoding needs to be finalized, including encoding of the upgrade count parameter), but now it&#x27;s a matter of writing this additional code outside of the actual password hashing code (already capable of computing possibly-upgraded hashes).<p>Unfortunately, with memory-hard schemes such upgrades involve an efficiency loss in terms of normalized area-time, and there&#x27;s a tradeoff between granularity of upgrades and efficiency. For Catena (another PHC finalist that supports these), the time granularity is 2x to 3x, with efficiency down to 33.3%+ of non-upgraded hashes (after many upgrades). For yescrypt, it&#x27;s 4x to 5x granularity and 60%+ efficiency, respectively. (I felt that 33.3%+ is just not good enough - in my opinion, it&#x27;s usually better to postpone the upgrade until 60%+ can be achieved rather than upgrade early and prevent it from ever being achieved. The next easy step would be 77.7%+, but the granularity would be too high.)<p>At the same time, support for ROM access frequency tuning (and thus for ROM-on-SSD, as opposed to ROM-in-RAM) has been dropped from yescrypt for now. The rationale is that builtin ROM-on-SSD didn&#x27;t make enough sense without also having a ROM-in-RAM (in use cases for the former, the latter would also be easily affordable, including complexity wise, and would provide significant extra defense), and supporting two ROMs at once would be further beyond the comfort level for complexity of a hashing scheme in PHC (yescrypt is already somewhat beyond the comfort level). Support for two ROMs along with access frequency tuning might be re-added in an extended revision of yescrypt for specialized use cases at a later time, but this will be outside of PHC.",1423212280

Does this fact make it ethically OK for someone else to sell a “closed” car to me?<p>That&#x27;s not the deciding factor.  I&#x27;ve no particular ethical qualm with it if you know full well what you&#x27;re getting into and choose it.<p>>> […] I&#x27;d simply not buy that car […]<p>> That was not the question. The question was if would be ethically OK to sell that car, not if you (or anyone else) would buy it or not.<p>&quot;Neither choice is based on ethics.&quot;  The ethics of the sale would depend on the other particulars, but if we assume those other particulars were all ethical, then <i>yes, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s ethically OK to sell you that car.</i><p>Let&#x27;s take a few concrete examples where a car has indeed been welded shut.<p>- I&#x27;m selling you the car for you to resell at a profit as scrap metal.
- I&#x27;m selling a clunker I tried to &quot;repair&quot;.  A few poorly followed DIY guides later and... well, I made some mistakes.
- In a fit of mental illness, or for the sake of a harmless prank, I welded my car shut intentionally.<p>In which circumstances should I feel guilt trying to sell it to you?  To me, it&#x27;s the ones where I&#x27;m trying to mislead you.  That could be any of the above (I lie and say it&#x27;s not welded, lie about the scrap tonnage, I try to convince you welded cars are in vogue, etc.) or none of the above (I&#x27;m upfront about the facts and ensure you know what you&#x27;re getting into.)<p>>> But you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to convince me it&#x27;s a problem for your $3 copy of Canabalt.<p>> It also wouldn’t really be a large issue with a simple enough car or car-like conveyance, like maybe a bicycle, or a Segway. Does this make it OK?<p>I didn&#x27;t say you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to convince me it&#x27;s a &quot;small enough&quot; issue or problem to fly under some ethical radar or waterline.  I&#x27;m saying you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to convince me it&#x27;s a problem, period.<p>>> It doesn&#x27;t need an oil change.<p>> Software needs updating. Static software is dead code.<p>I disagree with your assertions.  You might <i>want</i> to update it, but there&#x27;s a big difference between want and need.  Plenty of old DOS and cartridge games are still quite playable.  And for the purposes of archival and preservation of the commons, I think a focus on emulation provides more bang for the buck than trying to modernize every abandoned application - and, it should be noted, doesn&#x27;t require updating the software.<p>EDIT:  On the subject of unanswered questions, I&#x27;ll repose my original one to you since the original poster isn&#x27;t answering.<p>Do you actually think my day job - making (proprietary) games - is immoral? A daily dose of evil?",1423210289

Once you get more comfortable being in your own company and doing stuff on your own then people will get more interested in you. Pick up some intellectual interest or activity outside of your work and preferably not related to it. Consider getting a dog - seriously It&#x27;s surprisingly emotionally rewarding plus you get automatic entry to this whole secret society of dog owners and an automatic icebreaker/topic of positive small talk. I wasn&#x27;t into dogs at all until I rescued one, but it turned out to be a big positive and well worth the required lifestyle adjustments. Also, women will size a guy up by how he relates to his dog. If your dog is chill and happy, then people will come over to tell you how cute it is, and this will reflect onto you.",1423210152

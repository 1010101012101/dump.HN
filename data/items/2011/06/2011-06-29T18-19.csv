Previously if a comment had a high point score, you would stop to read it, and thus probably vote on it, causing it to have an even higher score. The new system lacks that positive feedback cycle. Top comments still are more likely to get upvotes because of their page position, but there's no easy way to distinguish how much better comment #6 is compared to comment #7 so comment #6 will get glossed over more under the new system.",1309373950

Specifically, consumers looking for the higher end of the spectrum.<p>At least, the only higher-end provider linked in the article, Demon [1], seems to offer abysmally low bandwidth caps on almost every plan, and generally low max download speeds (20Mb or less). How well are their bandwidth caps enforced? I ask because Comcast does not seem to enforce their bandwidth caps in San Francisco, at least for customers on their >$99/mo Home plans.<p>I realize that this is an extremely small sample size, how well does this trend describe other UK providers? Personally, given the option between any of the plans Demon has to offer, I'd still prefer my 50Mbps down/10 up Comcast line that has effectively no cap, for which I pay 100/mo. Is Demon the exception and not the rule when it comes to pricier third party providers in the UK?<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.demon.net/broadband"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.demon.net/broadband</a>",1309373875

Facebook's decline will come from any of a number of new and as-yet-unimagined products that are focused on helping users make new social connections rather than rigidly codifying existing ones. A place for you to chat with your weed buddies, another for your gaming pals, another for your family. Something more analogous to how we socialize in reality. Google's trying this with circles but their social blindspot doesn't leave me confident they'll get anywhere.

The original version described in ""Haskell on a Shared-Memory Multiprocessor"" shows a performance hit usually under 10% for sequential code. I expect it's only gotten better with tuning since then.
(Of course, purity helps a lot. Re-evaluating a pure thunk produces the same result, so two threads entering the same code just costs performance rather than correctness, and it's usually enough to use simple reads and writes to narrow the window).",1309373618

There is an efficiency in having somebody who knows when and how to call it. That is a form of hierarchy. Look at an open source project - the ultimate decentralization case - and yet 99% of the time there are one or more alpha geeks. That is a form of hierarchy. The fact that it arises spontaneously and is consensual does not make it less so.<p>The problem with hierarchy generally is not in the concept - it is in the implementation, and its poor scalability.<p>[Disclaimer: I herd geeks for a living.

Ubuntu / Linux actually has the potential to become more power efficient than Microsoft Windows 7 based upon the close findings from today.

We didn't pay any taxes. We didn't have any signed agreements with ""customers"". We didn't have any permits from the city council either.  There were no employees... heck, we weren't even registered as a business.<p>We just threw UTP cables through the city like it was in our own backyard. The only problem was after thunderstorms, when there was a shortage of switches to replace the burned ones :) Oh, and from time to time I had to call some customer's mom to ask her to reset the stuck switch hosted by her kid, because half the network couldn't connect to the internet.<p>Users paid about $10 for 100 mbps connectivity with other users (multiplayer games and movie/mp3 sharing) and 64 kbps internet access.<p>Basically we were just some highscool/college kids building a LAN, and every user paid a share of the costs. My network had about 200 subscribers and covered a 2x2 km area. Several networks like this one were scattered throughout the city. Every month a couple of new networks appeared, while others bit the dust (including my own).<p>-----------------
<i></i> 2003 - 2004 <i></i><p>(By this time me and my friends lost interest in being a ""pseudo-ISP"", so I can only speak from the POV of a customer)<p>Networks with 100-300 users began joining together forming networks of 1000+ subscribers. Companies were formed, real sys-admins were hired. Some backbones were now built with fiber optics.<p>Big companies noticed this and started to complain in the mass-media, calling such networks ""illegal"". Well, they were partly right (nobody gave a f#ck about building permits and taxes).<p>Now users paid $10 for 100 mbps connectivity with hundreds and even thousands of other people, and 256 kbps internet access. Big telcos were barely able to offer 128 kbps with a monthly traffic limit.<p>-----------------
<i></i> 2005 - 2008 <i></i><p>Big telcos stopped complaining and began building their networks. Then increased their networks speeds, removed the FUP, offered subscriber packages (phoneline + cable + internet access). For $10 you could get a landline and 5 mbps internet.<p>A lot of city ""LANs"" couldn't keep up with the big guys and crumbled. Others joined forces and became real ISPs (with tech support, tax payments, ...) and some even managed to obtain money from investment funds. They could still compete with the main ISPs because they offered much better tech support, and the 100 mbps LAN speed was still of huge interest, even if the internet access was limited to 1-10 mbps.<p>-----------------
<i></i> 2009 - 2010 <i></i><p>Small ISPs begin implementing Fiber to the Building. Hello Gigabit (well, 1000 mbps with others subscribers only... the internet connection is limited to 20-30 mbps).<p>Big telcos buy more and more small ISPs, but also continue to improve their infrastructure. Some drop the old cable (with its DOCSIS modems) and begin implementing Fiber to the Building too.<p>-----------------
<i></i> Today <i></i><p>For $10 per month you can get 100 mbps internet access + 5GB of mobile 3G connection. My ISP started installing Fiber Optics to the home (GPON technology) for houses and continues installing Fiber to the Builing (and UTP from there to your apartment) for high buildings. They also began installing WiFi access points through the cities (free access for all subscribers).<p>-----------------<p>IN THE END, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE ROMANIAN GOVERMENT FOR NOT INTERFERING. 
And if the large companies will try to form monopolies, I'm sure new ISPs will appear. I don't care about regulations. Thank you.",1309373035

For example, is there a strong correlation between liking Kurt Vonnegut and being an atheist? One of my favorite things about OkCupid is the OkTrends blog which reveals interesting things about their data. But, I have to wait until new posts are made on their blog to enjoy that.  It would be cool if you built a tool that allows people to play with your data in realtime, generating pretty visuals, and then from those reports have links to people's profiles.<p>Maybe I'm in a minority who would enjoy playing with an analysis tool like that, but if that tool existed then I could use it to discover exactly how small of a minority group I'm in! :-)<p>Anyway, good luck with this site.

The founders were skeptical of version control, a programmer said we need it. They adopted CVS even though the founders thought it was pointless. We moved to SVN a couple years later when another new programmer said CVS was crap. One frontend/designer told the founders the brand and company name was crap. He created a new brand and name. Now he is in charge of the marketing department. We now have a UX department because one designer wanted to try it.<p>We have changed lots of things about our process and tools because the managers listen to what we, the developers, designers, QA, etc, say and ask for.<p>As we grow (doubling this year), our biggest challenge is maintaining the communication. Management wants, and I believe they are sincere, to have a way for anyone to complain or point out what we are doing wrong in an open and safe way. Part of that means being able to post anonymously. We once had a great discussion questioning why we are growing and why we focus on the market we do. These are big topics, unlike washing dishes and choice of coffee.<p>The problem is not people complaining or questioning what we are doing. The problem is someone anonymously saying ""x sucks"" then not having a discussion. Yes, X does suck, but if the person posting this isn't willing to give examples of why it sucks or suggest how to fix it, I consider it a harmful use of the anonymous post.",1309372951

You gain any revenue from an affiliate program such as Amazon Associates, any merchant out-of-state in Commission Junction/LinkShare/GAN, etc.<p>2. If the total amount of sales you have generated for the merchant in the previous 12 months before the bill is signed exceeds $10,000 OR the merchant in total has sold over $500,000 of merchandise to California customers period.<p>3. If you do not have a fixed IO (Insertion Order) where the merchant specifically asks to advertise on your site and does so with a fixed budget and amount to be spent (this is still shaky, I'm currently getting advice from my lawyer on this).<p>There are more factors I'm getting from my lawyer today, I'll post them as they come up.<p>WHAT IT WILL MEAN:<p>This bill will be signed into law on Friday apparently. As California is under a Fiscal Emergency, the law will take effect IMMEDIATELY. The moment it is signed, any merchant that has a relationship with you that qualifies in the points above will be immediately subject to fines and/or legal action.<p>This will result in the immediate loss of any further revenue you would gain that qualifies.<p>WHO SPONSORED THIS JUNK?<p>This trailer bill is the roll-up of three separate bills introduced in the California legislature this year:<p>1. AB153, Sponsored by Nancy Skinner, Berkeley. She has tried this bill every single year for 3 years. She has no grasp on the effect this will have on her own constituents (startups in Berkeley) and doesn't care.

This one is the worst of all, as it could qualify any manner of online presence/contracting/advertising as nexus. This thing is nuts and Loni Hancock has literally no clue how this works and doesn't care a whit about the effect it will have (she said as much). Bill text: http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_0201-0250/sb_234_bill_20110209_introduced.html<p>These bills have been heavily lobbied by Wal-Mart, Target, Best-Buy and Home Depot. They created the ""alliance for main-street fairness"" to push these bills. The irony, that they helped kill main-street and profess to be helping it, is sickening.<p>OH HELLS BELLS WHAT CAN I DO?<p>Get the word out. There is literally no time to waste. Every single startup that relies on income that qualifies can be affected horribly by this. Tell everyone, I don't care how, just spread the word.<p>Write it on your blog. Make phone calls.

For example, I seem to recall Mencius Moldbug discussing them as a mechanism for regime change.<p>The idea being that in a totalitarian regime like North Korea (or to a lesser extent, the countries of the 'Arab Spring'), it's well known that even the elites are discontented and would support the overthrow of the regime. But there is a knowledge problem, a coordination problem, that they cannot be sure of the support of all the other elites and factions. If they declare their opposition publicly, the still loyal elements will dispose of them. But private declarations which are safe also do not reach enough people to constitute any sort of Schelling point. (This is one of the main points of protests: taking risks, demonstrating solidarity, and a genuine costly signal. If there's sporadic gunfire and suppression from the regime, all the better - scare away the pikers.)<p>On the other hand, suppose you had a secure anonymous forum for, say, just military officers? With one of the anonymous e-voting schemes integrated to get a headcount of subversive questions like 'how many of us officers would support a regime change?'

In new york I lived in what was more or less a walk in closet for 600 and purchased a monthly subway pass for about 85$ a month. 

  Theres so much to do in new york though that the accomodations didn't really impact my quality of life.

  Additionally, Food was cheaper in astoria than it is in seattle, or than it was in california. Street vendors are tasy and inexpensive. Resturants outside of manhatten are reasonable. A couple of resturants inside of manhatten are reasonable. 

   Clothing was pretty cheap especially for the quality level if one is willing to hunt around a bit for good aftermarket stores. 

  7$ beers in the city were a little annoying but prices plummet as you head towards queens or brooklynn.

  Life may be cheaper in some locals but the quantity of ammenities and quality of life makes up for a possibly modest increase in expense.

The problem was, this isn't scalable unless you remove flood throttle from the bot (which is almost always a <i>very</i> bad idea) and there's still the possibility of the person running the bot looking at the raw IRC data to find out who is saying what.

So just hunting wasn't enough to require the wild herds to also grow exponentially for survival.  Let's face it, the issue is not meat, it's growth of the human population.  But nobody wants to advocate eliminating humans (and definitely I don't), so we have to make the hard choices sometimes.  I'd say the bigger issue isn't carbon footprint, it's water supply.<p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/water-use-of-foods-2011-4?op=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/water-use-of-foods-2011-4?op=...</a>",1309370446

The thing is, I can't think of a single way to make {} be treated as false in the boolean context, so 1) I don't think you'd ever need anything more than ""option = option || {}"", 2) I think the example would have been better off using an integer or string where you actually might have to use the ugly long format.<p>EDIT: Unless of course you get some non object value passed in and you want to be sure to keep it regardless of whether or not it is falsy. Not sure why you'd want to do that -- I am sure I would NOT like to see someone do that if I had to deal with their code.",1309370443

2710481,comment,2708361,2709127,2,0,stellar678,,,"In discussions about electric cars there always seem to be two arguments that end up head-to-head:<p>1. That <i>average</i> or mode of distance traveled per day is less than X miles. (60 or something, a distance many electric car designs have no problem achieving)
2. That people won't accept a car that can't do long-distance trips.<p>The Volt/serial hybrid (which Volt actually isn't) design responds to both of these arguments. If we transitioned all cars on the road to this, the average drive wouldn't consume any gasoline at all but people could still take their infrequent longer road trips.<p>That's the premise I've seen at least.",1309370419

First, he used his own experience as a former employee of the telecom giant to push for change from the inside. When that wasn't enough, he used the bully pulpit provided by his government post to embarrass BT in public. He publicized the company's failure to meet goals. Reporters loved the story of the government regulator holding the giant firm's feet to the fire.</i><p>I wonder if there are similar tales in the U.S. of the brave little bureaucrat against the hulking titan of industry.

Search refers to calculating multi-dimensional relevance in real time. Here's a quick, two-dimensional example:<p>A search for ""fender"" could be configured to have related keywords: ""music"", ""gisbon"", and ""automobile"", ""ford"". The strength of the relation should also be configurable as it's used to create a score for the weight of each keyword. Then expand each keyword: fender, fenders, music, musical, etc... These expansions are given slightly lower scores than the keywords. Then we consider what fields in the data set to look for these values. Each field has a score. We determine which records to include by making a two-dimensional calculation between the keywords and fields. Now we sort the result set based on the same or other additional criteria and return.<p>There are <i>many</i> possible dimensions include misspellings, synonyms, wildcards, user history, brands. Basically anything. And the data-set get much larger. That's why search is so difficult.<p>I'm not criticizing Whoosh specifically because other open source ""search engine"" libraries have the same weaknesses. But it is important to understand the difference between search and lookup.",1234456759

478591,comment,478360,478530,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Actually one of the most interesting things in plant evolution is that they evolved into fruit producers to protect themselves from large herbivores. Primates likely served as an ample defense against skittish herbivores. There's trees that host nests of ants that will drive away a giraffe, and what do the ants get in return? Fruit of course.<p>Even if Dinosaurs hadn't been killed in a mass extinction, trees had already begun evolving their countermeasure and it's the fruit production which is directly attributed to the spread of primates. So we would have likely evolved in some form even if dinosaurs were still around.<p>I mean there's some extremely weird things in the world that give an insight into what would have happened in a world with dinosaurs. The most common thing we think of is snakes, crocodiles and alligators eating large pray animals and being rather successful. However the smallest mammals seem able to defend their territory from reptiles. I've heard of adult rabbits killing snakes, which is rather contrary to what you'd think. I've seen a Hare eating a grass snake before. Meerkats will chase off puff adders (that can kill humans), baboons will torments and kill crocodiles.<p>The thing that really illustrates what primates would have done against the predominantly land based dinosaurs is that a gibbons will defend their territory from tigers. I saw it on National Geographic IIRC, and it's quite amusing to watch because the gibbon will grab at the ears, pull on the tail and just outright kick and slap the tiger while swinging from the trees. If it's nothing for a gibbon to fight off a tiger, then imagine what it would be like for any dinosaurs that are ambush predators.",1234455736

478576,comment,478496,478496,0,0,jacquesm,,,"1) no contest, but then again it is pretty obvious.<p>2) that may be true, but how many of those fall in the 'hot spare' or backup server category ? I would guess quite a few of them, I only run 19 servers, but 3 of those are stand-by with databases replicated in real time and 1 is a backup server. Conceivably I could power cycle the backup server and only have it powered up when it is doing a backup but past experience has led me to believe that frequently power cycling machines is an excellent way to shorten their life spans.<p>3)  Fair enough, virtualization can reduce your power consumption. A 65% reduction in server count through virtualization is mentioned, I've seen numbers between 20% and 90% in other articles on virtualization, it only is relevant if you are currently not using your servers to full capacity, and some things can not be virtualized effectively. You'll have to do some measuring before you can compute the impact this will have in your particular situation.<p>4) true, an even better way is to use a heatpump instead of regular AC.<p>6) DC supplies are more efficient, but in an existing datacenter the cost of running a complete new supply grid to save some energy is usually not worth it. If you're going to create a new datacenter from scratch and you have some control over the equipment that will be housed there then you should definitely look at this as an option. Beware though, you'll need two powergrids because not all gear is available with a DC supply option. I don't know what 'active current' is, where I'm from we call it 'alternating current'.<p>8 nice fact, it would be neat to get more information on this and on what sets google datacenters apart from the standard. We have google datacenter less than 10 kilometers from where I'm sitting, maybe I'll apply for a tour :)<p>11) I'm expecting the coming flash revolution to completely reverse that trend, and to end up with the CPUs as the biggest consumers, not the storage devices.<p>14) that may be true, but the trend is towards 'always on' technology. We'll have to find some median between being online 24/7 and power usage, a machine that throttles itself down aggressively when not in use would be ideal for the home.<p>15) depends very much on your price per KWh, where I live it would actually be more (assuming 100 watts of continuous consumption for your PC and screen it would cost you several 100 dollars per year to keep such a machine running all the time).<p>19 & 20) simply don't print stuff!! I've stopped printing stuff 10 years ago and if it wasn't for some of my customers still demanding printed invoices even our bookkeeping would no longer have a printer.<p>21) this is mostly an issue for the employers, and a matter of trust.

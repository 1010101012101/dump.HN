Their focus is not only on calling signals but also on education and mentoring for those traders who have the time and actually want to learn how to become independent traders. If you are a trader that doesn't have a lot of time to dedicate on learning how to trade, but still want to profit from currency trading, then this is also for you, if you do however have the time and actually want to learn tactics and strategies for becoming a successful independent trader than this is also for you. No matter what sort of trader you are or want to become The Forex signals have you covered.<p>The Forex Signals offers a variety of different memberships to suit all levels and types of traders, beginners and experienced ones.Bob and Vladimir provide you with the exact entry level, multiple targets, stop loss and fulln instructions.

Bob and Vladimir analyze the charts & predict market moves, then provide you with quality signals, all while mentoring and educating you so that you can become a professional trader and thrive in the market. Whether you are a beginner in Forex trading or you have been trading for a while, The Forex Signals offers a comprehensive ongoing service that will suit your trading style, level, as well as your life style.<p>As a trader of many years myself I give this system the thumbs up, what better way to learn how to become and independent forex trader by learning from two of the worlds best forex traders out there.

As in:<p><pre><code>  x = 4 -> x > 3\n</code></pre>\ndoes not in any way imply that x is the only number larger than 3, or that x is only larger than 3. I specifically wrote ""x1"" to indicate _a_ solution, not _the_ solution; if it was _the_ solution, there would have been no need for the ""1"" index.<p>> it must have the form ""x1 = (-b + sqrt(b^2-4ac))/2*a"".<p>Alternatively, since sqrt could be the multi valued function with no specific branch selected, this actually does give all the solutions.<p>> However, I'm willing to admit that this is nitpicking.<p>And I can't even find any appreciation for it - Because you picked a set of assumptions (x is Real or Complex, sqrt is a specific branch of a multi-branch function, no natural order for solutions) treated as axioms, but question others, where said axioms actually determine correctness.<p>Are you sure I was not, in fact, describing an equation in Z_2?<p>Nitpicking at this level, especially if you do it often, might make you feel good about yourself, but doesn't actually get you anywhere.<p>-- beagle3, who started professional life as a mathematician and switched to engineering at a later stage.",1305512416

2551363,comment,2550321,2550321,6,0,merubin75,,,"I don't know about this conference, since I wasn't there. But speaking as someone who has helped organize conferences attended by a few thousand people, there are two points I would like to respectfully make:<p>1. Sometimes, the conference is about PEOPLE and the content of the sessions. I confess that at more than a few of the events I helped organize, it was no accident that the WiFi was wonky or non-existent. Yes, some people bitched and moaned, but the overall effect was that that attendees and speakers felt engaged with each other because everyone put their laptops away and actually paid attention to one another. In conversations and after-event surveys, the #1 bit of positive feedback was, ""Hurray for having an event where the WiFi was turned off.""<p>Yes, we all know that a lot of people attend events and use Social Media to bring in a larger audience from those who could not attend (I do), but all too often, I see people sitting there with laptops open to work e-mail. They're not there to add anything to the discussion, and really, what's the point of even being there?<p>Of course, a good conference organizer has already worked to insure that the speakers are well-prepared, moderators are trained and will actually do their job, and the content is valuable (not a sales pitch). It pains me to no end when I attend an event that waste my time by not having those three items checked off.<p>2. ""Now you booked a venue and they say that they can handle the WIFI for you. Chances are, they are lying.""<p>Respectfully, there's no conspiracy here. If your event is taking place at a hotel or conference center, then more times than not, WiFi is an expensive add-on (all things are expensive add-ons in the hospitality industry, but that's a subject for a much longer post). You have no control over it, and in fact, if you try to rig up a few routers and roll your own hotspot, you're often in violation of your facility's contract which means fines or blacklisting from future events.<p>Just my two cents from my own experience. Yours may differ, so we may disagree, but no flames, please.",1305511271

15058,comment,14852,14852,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"When I ask myself that question, the only thing that comes to mind is freedom. So I guess a bit of both - joy of secured freedom (a profitable company) and fear of losing my freedom (having to get an office job again).<p>After experiencing the freedom of working exactly the way I want to (through the night, sleep during day, days off if I need them), it feels me with huge dread to think of going back to answering to a 'boss'. Ugh.<p>So I guess I'm more heavily weighted in the fear of losing my current freedom.",1177076880

Also a bit of a fear that I'll look like an idiot when I've already told 15-25 people about what I'm working on. And now I've gone and told all of news.YC.

Here's a list of features my startup would provide. <p>\nIt would make it easy for you to:<p>-- Create an online memorial<p>-- Make it public; for the world to see<p>-- Make it private; just for friends and family<p>-- Collaborate with friends and family; create the memorial    together<p>-- Collect and organize your memories, stories, videos and pictures<p>-- Save it forever.<p>Some notes: <p>This might sound a little morbid but people do this stuff when a relative or friend passes away. Why not make it easier?<p>My wife calls it MyDeadSpace. Funny gal. I don't plan on using that name.<p>[EDIT]<p>Sincere thanks for everyone's feedback.

I don't see anyone here getting into defence contracting any time soon.<p>Granted, there are some common sense aspects that are slam dunks (c'mon, version control, why wouldn't you use it) but a lot of it still favours <i>serious software</i> where all the engineers wear dark suits and ties and do <i>big design up front</i>. <p>Most startups would run out of time and money just getting to level 2 CMMi compliance before they even started to really cut any code.",1177076005

15046,comment,14935,14936,0,0,zeph,,,"If you look at it in <i>really</i> objective terms, what is a fair RoI for the paycut you take? Pick a number, if say you want a 5x return and expect to be there for 2 years, that's $200k you should bank after acquisition. if they go out at $10mil... then you want to have at least 2% equity.<p>Obviously, the longer you hang around, the lower the actual return you get for sacrificing the extra $20k/pa you could get elsewhere. If you wanted to take an even gloomier view, you could calculate the yield on investing $20k/pa, take into account consumer price indexes and any rising market rates. Oh and don't forget the potential for dilution.<p>Unless your employer is going out in many multiples of $10mil, it's probably better to take market rates elsewhere, and use the extra $20k to invest/bootstrap your own startup on the side :)",1177075750

The compiler becomes aware of such patterns too.<p>A clever guy writes a login program in the UNIX shell language [substitute with Lisp, Perl, Python or God forbid, Java]<p>Ken Thompson's compiler then becomes aware when it compiles the shell interpreter (or whatever compiler/VM).<p>Shortly before the end of the days Ken Thompson's compiler becomes aware of itself and whatever it compiles and screams ""Mommy, I exist!""<p>(Actually, to prevent Ken Thompson's compiler to become self-aware, you may write a manual for system administrators in human language on how to manually detect malicious code in a compiler binary and how to modify it with some binary editor.)",1177075513

15036,comment,14645,14670,0,0,Goladus,,,"One can go on and on about how myspace can be improved, before you even consider what members do to their own pages.  It's true that the huge draw of myspace now is all the people already using it.  People are willing to put up with a lot of garbage because of that.  It could be faster and more streamlined.<p>But Myspace got a lot right.  The default profile layout is excellent.  Picture + basic information is immediately visible, as is the control panel (add/msg/favorite/block/etc).  The friend space is prominent (even if it is not immediately visible) and the mini pictures of your friends are large enough to attract attention.  Page comments include profile pictures, and links to the commenter's profile.  The bulletin feature is extremely useful and popular.  Finally, however kludgy the interface might be, users have enormous freedom to modify and personalize their own page.<p>",1177074586

We tried using  festoon through skype, which worked reasonably well except that only one person could share an application and the others just watch.  So you would share your application, sketch on it, then unshare it.  The next person would have to share, sketch, etc.  It was awkward.  This, however, looks great.",1177074252

Unless you need big money up front to build this thing (and you don't seem to think that's the case), I get the feeling that he desperately wants to be seen as an entrepreneur.<p>Entrepreneurs market the hell out of their product, but ""Wantrepreneurs"" just market the hell out of themselves.<p>Or to put it another way, is he in love with the product, or in love with the idea that he's an entrepreneur?

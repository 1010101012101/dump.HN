1221759,story,,,7,13,Arkanin,"HN: The distress of a young padawan. (rant)",,"Warning: rant.<p>I have an MIS degree from a mediocre university, but I am quite smart, and I am doing my best to become a good IT professional. I am doing extremely well at my company, but some day I could be a real master at something.<p>Here is my problem. I'm learning stuff -- doesn’t matter what -- and trying to pull myself up by the bootstraps. I have to if I want real mastery. For me, personally, I want to become great at something so badly it becomes emotional. Most newer developers are asking for technical advice. ""Why won't my code compile"", ""Why is this outer join slow"" (heh). I almost never do that, I figure it out for myself.<p>Meanwhile, I'm quitting smoking (6 mos. by the way) while I try to do exercises to improve my memory and reading comprehension because college never asked me to cope with those personal failings, but my job did. I’m smart, but I have faults in the way I learn and other personal problems. I feel like if I want to become good I can sit here on my laurels and keep grinding away, but if I want to become great I have to change my entire life.<p>The thing is, right now I have no mentors and nobody seems to be aware of what I'm struggling through or has been through this process on their own. I don’t know anyone that has ever wanted to change as badly as I do and succeeded. I feel like if my IQ was in the genius instead of just very bright range or if I graduated from MIT instead of a Tech school, I could someday command actual respect about some kind of technology without completely overhauling my life. But I’m not. Yet I want to be.<p>Can any of you remember what this feels like, as a young developer with no credibility? Have you ever been there? Can you just empathise?<p>I go online and see the most brilliant people who know so much, and they are all older than me, and brighter than most of the folks at my company. It's terrifying to witness their level of understanding and realize that someday, I must follow in their footsteps.<p>To the online developer communities -- is there a way I can start building my online credibility as a worthwhile developer / IT Professional without 20 years of experience? Is there a way I can prove I'm at least promising enough not to be dismissed by reasonably intelligent people?<p>How do you guys find MENTORS and ROLE MODELS? I want to be great. Right now, I'm above average and exasperated. Can you relate?",1269629904

It's a quick read and gives a refreshing and blunt opinions about method acting.<p>From the editorial review on Amazon.com:\n""To hell with Stanislavsky. To hell with the Method. ""The actor is onstage to communicate the play to the audience,"" says David Mamet. ""That is the beginning and the end of his and her job. To do so the actor needs a strong voice, superb diction, a supple, well-proportioned body and a rudimentary understanding of the play."" Anything else--""becoming"" one's part, ""feeling"" the character's emotions--devalues the practice of a noble craft and is useless to the play. ""The 'work' you do 'on the script' will make no difference,"" he cautions. ""That work has already been done by a person with a different job title than yours. That person is the author.""""<p>However, what I personally think is even more interesting is that before and after reading Mamet's book I've always found Mamet's movies somehow lacking on the emotional level. Either Mamet's opinions about acting (and directing) are a crock of shit, or I don't understand anything about the subject.",1269629656

Same goes for Amazon with Dynamo. These people operate on scales that startups like us can't even comprehend; and they've found it worthwhile to write their own datastores for those scenarios. Moreover, their use of those databases has apparently contributed to their success.

The 300's are a bit smaller, with a lower service ceiling and a shorter range.  At present, the 300's also have older avionics.  They are not completely interchangeable.<p>Still, maintaining only two types of airplanes that are very close to the same size and specs is a lot easier than maintaining ten types of airplanes with very different sizes and specs.  The extra expense of sending a 700 on a flight that's only full enough to require a 300 (because they need a 700 on the other end) is much smaller than, say, the expense of flying a 747 for a route that only needs a 737.  The extra expense of bumping one or two people (and giving them free flight vouchers) to free up a slightly larger plane for a different route is also quite small.<p>As you correctly note, there are a lot of efficiencies that come in to play from having a nearly-uniform fleet.",1269629480

For a recent tradeshow we did I had someone on elance doing a short video production for me for $150.  The money was a no-brainer and allowed to concentrate on other stuff.  I also hired someone on elance (for $500) to write an xcode framework for me for an iPhone app idea.  I could probably figure it out myself, but (I'm hoping) it will be easier and more efficient to get started in iPhone app programming by having someone more knowledgeable than I put together the basics so I can see how it's done.

In fact, most of the C projects that I have worked with use OO techniques in some form.  For instance, look at the Linux kernel.  There are plenty of structures that include function pointers, which in practice is very similar to inheritance.  Also, consider the UNIX concept of a ""file""; that's OO design, pure and simple.<p>I wouldn't say that C++ is ""better"" than C, but for certain tasks I think it is easier to use.  Consider the C++ inheritance model; sure, you can do the same thing in C, but unless you choose a common convention, each new developer will have to learn your way of doing it.  With C++, inheritance works in a uniform way, so a new developer doesn't have to guess at how you did it.<p>With that said, I think that there is something to be said for the simplicity of C, versus more complicated languages like C++.

Thank you for the explanation.<p>I'm very reluctant to consider checking baggage again, even seeing the increased level of concern a company might give my bags.  I hear so many horror stories, and as an individual traveler, checking baggage is extremely time-consuming.<p>A few months ago, I waited with my mother at baggage claim for 3 hours before they finally determined that her bags were in a different state.  Even when things are running as expected, it takes an order of magnitude more time to get in and out with your bags.",1269626749

I suffered the same thing. Romanticizing TV shows from the 80s. They looked larger then life because I was just a kid. But now when I watch them, I hear crappy dialog, poor acting, weak plots, and cheap special effects. Things you couldn't get away with today. Some people see programming the same way. Programmers back then had to rely on tricks because the hardware wasn't up to snuff. Those same tricks also make problems as the software goes.<p>Also, I just built my kitchen out of IKEA. If anything IKEA kitchens are the closest equivalent to todays software. Different, but interchangeable parts that fit a standard (the API). The cabinets that were replaced were 30 years old. And what you see is what you got. A little bit of rot meant the whole thing had to be torn out. If I needed to replace a door I would have to have one custom made; same for the drawers.<p>Now, not all IKEA is great. I had a cheap IKEA office cabinet and compared to the kitchen cabinet of the same dimensions it was 1/3 the weight. But the price reflected the quality of the goods and sometimes all you want is a cheap office cabinet, other times you want a sturdy kitchen cabinet with a 25 year warranty.",1269626715

I might note in contrast that the SEC has considered this change before and decided against it after public consultation.<p>Now, asking them to review it again in the wake of a serious financial crisis might result in the effects described, but then again it might not. I don't think that the idea of re-examining the regulatory environment is inherently bad. Capital formation is not being singled out, just reviewed as part of a comprehensive regulatory overhaul.<p>And yes, I do support a comprehensive regulatory overhaul, which is not the same thing as a general increase in complexity or strictness. It might even result in simplification of regulation by clarifying some of the ambiguity in existing regulation (bear in mind that regulation D was itself written in the wake of a severe recession). Our financial system has been at the epicenter of a truly severe crisis and I think it's quite appropriate to re-examine the rules it operates under.",1269626692

Having toilets cost money - to service between flights and by taking up space that could be used for seats. Either way you pay for them, in a charge for those who use it or as part of each persons ticket price - take your choice.<p>2. They can will either fill it with cargo or leave it empty depending on demand. In the first case, Ryanair get paid to transport it and in the second the flight will use less fuel. In either case, the result is cheaper tickets for passengers.",1269626504

It also seems very “un-Firefox” considering Firefox (Phoenix…) began as a slimmed down Mozilla/Netscape Suite.<p>Maybe short sighted of me, but I don’t really like my web browser to do much more than “browse”. Email, contacts, news readers etc. all feel much nicer as their own dedicated applications. Chances are I’ll come to eat these words within 10 years, though.<p>Feels like Mozilla are floundering a little on ways to innovate in the browser space. Google really shook things up by improving the core browser technology, rather than adding loads of end-user oriented features. Essentially the same thinking that lead to Firefox originally.",1269626494

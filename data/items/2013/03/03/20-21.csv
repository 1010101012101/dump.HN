A single vulnerability in that process gives the attacker the ability to write to all of system memory.  This can be mitigated somewhat by mmap()ing only the smallest possible region of interest, then dropping root privileges.",1362344328

What I am saying is that for some important fields of knowledge that it would be good to teach to some not small fraction of the population, college is a good solution; maybe the best that has been actually tested. Of course not going to college would be a great choice for a lot of people who are going there. But it is also the right choice for a large number of people.",1362344316

This is the best bullshit filter I've found, and I can see why lazy, dishonest, poorly informed, or otherwise sub-par journalists resent it.<p>I do something similar when reading HN. Scrolling through the headlines, I (almost) never click on the link itself. Instead, I open the discussion tabs, make a snap judgement about the quality of the piece from there, and click through only when it's clearly worthwhile. The ease with which this filter can be applied is the most amazing thing. At this point, it feels so fluid and natural that I do it reflexively.<p>A few years ago news outlets were coming to terms with the idea that there was no front page online. Yes, some readers did go to the outlets home page and decide what to read from there. But more often than not, they were coming directly to a piece that would have been buried in a print edition.

Naturally, when I first got my hands on a computer, I fell in love with it, just because I could create so many things with it. My personal interest back then, was videogames, so I started with creating simple text based games in BASIC. It wasn't the actual programming that interested me, but just the power, and the excitement of creating something new.<p>Now, I've picked up most of the major programming languages and I regularly hack on web dev projects. I've noticed that a large majority of websites/apps are simply CRUD apps with minor modifications here and there. Yet, we continue to create such apps manually, thus wasting hours of dev time on something that trivial. I do recognise that this is an obvious oversimplification, but why can't we just build one solid, well-engineered and well tested multiplatform solution for CRUD apps, and get done and over with it?<p>If I'm correct in my assumption that most developers are motivated not by the code they write, or the architectures they engineer, but the actual effect that those things have (as I mentioned earlier), then wouldn't it be much better for us to create higher level tools for working with CRUD business logic and focus our attention on the actual ""hard"" problems in CS, like AI, which could have a much greater impact on the world?",1362343947

I make a mistake when coding and things can be bad, but usually they are OK especially if you have revision control and a good workflow.<p>I make a mistake farming and things die and I have nothing to eat or sell.

5315143,comment,5314643,5314877,14,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The ""normal"" method of radiation shielding is almost none.<p>All of our manned spaceflights except for Apollo have been in low Earth orbit. Nestled deep down inside of Earth's magnetosphere protects you from a lot of radiation. Being above the ozone layer means that you are exposed to more ultraviolet light, but this isn't a big deal because it's not like you ""go outside"" much, you'll always have a window or a helmet between you and the Sun and those will always have a UV filter. The real issue is particle radiation, which comes from the Sun, the galaxy, and from parts of Earth's magnetosphere (the van allen belts). In low Earth orbit a lot of the solar and cosmic particle radiation is blocked, and as long as you steer clear of the van allen belts at high altitudes you'll be alright. The aluminum skin of spacecraft will protect you from some radiation, and you can add additional mass, especially water, to add more radiation protection. Overall in Earth orbit the radiation environment is fairly mild though a bit on the concerning side if you were to live there for decades.<p>If you have to travel through the van allen belts or outside Earth's protective magnetospheric bubble then things get much more difficult. In the case of the Apollo program they were careful to ensure that the thickness of the spacecraft's skin was enough to block a goodly amount of particle radiation and they designed the mission profile such that the spacecraft passed through the van allen belts as quickly as possible (spending as little time exposed to their radiation as could be managed). And in terms of operations in orbit around or on the Moon the main advantages was again one of time. Astronauts only spent at most a few days up there, limiting their radiation doses. However, they were extremely vulnerable to solar flares, which could have subjected them to extremely high doses of radiation that they had no way to protect against. In that they just got lucky.<p>A Mars mission, however, will spend months in interplanetary space and the chance of the crew being subjected to the radiation from a solar flare are very much higher. Additionally, they'll be subjected to much higher accumulated doses of radiation just by being in interplanetary space for so long. The thin aluminum skin of a spacecraft won't be sufficient protection for these conditions, so they'll need both a greater level of day to day protection and also an area of heavy protection that they can use to ride out solar flares and CMEs. Generally large masses of water or organic material work the best in protecting from the high energy protons that are the most concerning source of radiation in interplanetary space.<p>P.S. There's another option for shielding which is to generate a miniature magnetosphere around a spacecraft. This has a lot of advantages but the biggest disadvantage is that it would require additional equipment (weight is the biggest constraint on any Mars mission) as well as a significant amount of power and the technology hasn't been proven yet. Here's a neat paper on the subject: <a href=""http://www.ess.washington.edu/Space/M2P2/rad.shielding.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ess.washington.edu/Space/M2P2/rad.shielding.pdf</a>",1362342901

There is an obvious drop in quality, and no obvious reason to save cost in iPhone 5. They could have let the technology mature to quality parity and only then release it, so what gives? My theory is that Apple came under serious price pressure, as cheap smartphones are now the fastest growing segment of the market, and so they are preparing to ship a very cheap version of the iPhone. Given their position as high-margin company on one hand and pressure from low-margin competition on another, they felt the need to pinch every penny. And so the iPhone 5 ended up being the test bed for the new wave technology with much lower cost of entry, but more expensive accessories.

Based on their general network architecture, I would think a prudent thing would be a quick sanity test on a pre-production system if available, then deploy to the various colos in groups at intervals that seem appropriate given the nature of the change. If pre-production isn't available, then having the first group be one colo limits the production impact.<p>If they did some colos as vendor J and some colos as vendor C, I think it would be manageable, but I don't really know how much of the cross colo traffic is actually their routers talking to their routers.  Homogeneity in networks makes things easier to manage, until a platform fault breaks everything at the same time. In this case, at least it was related to a change they had made and happened quickly, so it was easy to determine the cause; other platform faults may not be as easy to determine, but if only your vendor X colos fell over, at least you'd have your vendor C colos up and something to look for.",1362341862

Perhaps those schools follow educational philosophies that deemphasize relative performance like Brown's gradeless system or emphasizing ""cooperation"" over individual ability. If your performance did not matter then perhaps there would be no incentive to cheat (or study). However these students are still humans and humans are lazy, greedy and proud - thus prone to cheating.<p>I can't speak for Pomona, but many HMC classes have timed, closed book take home exams. It would be trivially easy to cheat on these. On homework, collaboration was usually encouraged, with the caveat that problems sets should ultimately be written up individually -- what policy to take was the choice of the professor.<p>We certainly had grades.<p>>Maybe because they are small and there is no incentive to publicize episodes of cheating and damage their brand no stories have come out yet. Still a quick search finds several articles indicating concerns at these schools. And sister school Claremont McKenna has had several major scandals in recent years.<p>I'm appending data collected in a survey last year. The data was shared with students, but not AFAIK published outside. My personal perception is that cheating is uncommon, and I did not know of anybody I knew doing so. I believe very few people I knew would be open to cheating if approached by a friend.

People are told they will get better jobs and make more money if they get one.  However, no one really takes the time to tell them that just getting your degree does not qualify you to immediately go get a job doing exactly what you want.  Essentially, people have been oversold on what the degree actually gives them.<p>My belief is that a vast majority of the technology related jobs are the modern day equivalent of 'blue collar' work, more akin to tradesmen, such as electricians.  If you read up the requirements for an electrician in the U.S. (a brief read of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrician#United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrician#United_States</a> is good enough), it follows the same general trend we see with software development experience, even if the lines aren't as clearly drawn.<p>One caveat, I don't have a degree.  I'm pretty close if I were to want to go back and finish it, but I didn't drop out by choice.  I'm of the firm belief that it is possible, but significantly more difficult, to gain the same knowledge outside of a college or university, it's just harder to quantify the knowledge you have.  I would also suggest everyone go to college and get an undergraduate degree in something that interests them, but focusing on core classes and general requirements, not their particular interest.  Universities are great for two things, imparting a general base of knowledge and specialized knowledge.  However, undergraduate degrees have shifted to focus on specialized knowledge at the expense of general knowledge.<p>One last note in my long-winded comment, I really appreciate how you state 'you should go to grad school if you want to get better at CS' rather than the usual defense of schools saying that it's absolutely needed.",1362341792

5315041,comment,5312762,5314174,8,0,zyb09,,,"After thinking a little bit about it, I think this approach does make some sense and allows for more flexibility in the future. Keep in mind Lightning was likely designed to last well over a decade and will be used in many different devices.<p>Now since the adapter is a SoC and it's OS is booted from the device, what that means is, every device has essentially full control over how it wants to output HDMI, without having to change the adapter or the port. Right now this is accomplished using this quirky h.264 encode/decode workaround, but this is first-gen, and it doesn't have to stay that way. Future iDevices might load a different OS onto the SoC and output lossless 1080p using the exact same adapter! And without breaking older devices.<p>It frees Apple from having to define a fixed method of transmitting HDMI over Lightning now, that is then set in stone for the next 10 years, and has to be supported by every future device.<p>It also frees them from having unnecessary pins, which might become useless in the future, but have to carry over to every new device (a.k.a. 30-pin connector). And knowing Apple, probably THE top priority of Lightning was to have a slick, easy-to-plug-in-n-out, user-friendly connector, which Lightning admittedly does way better then any MicroUSB standard.<p>Because in essence, the only thing that is fixed about Lightning is the physical shape and pins, so they focused on getting that aspect right and future-proof. How the data is transmitted can be changed on a device level basis.",1362341012

Material that serves another purpose could be put around the outside of the spacecraft and act as shielding.<p>Machinery doesn't work too well, because it needs to be in a particular spot to work, and there isn't enough of it, and the stuff it's made out of isn't the best material for shielding.<p>Food and water, on the other hand, you can store just about anywhere. It's pretty good shielding too. For a Mars trip, you need a lot of it.<p>However, it's consumable. Food might be good shielding at the start of the trip, but there won't be much left at the end. Fortunately, food doesn't disappear when eaten, it's just transformed. The transformed food is still just about as good at shielding as the original was.<p>I assume this is more or less the chain of thought that got to this point.",1362340950

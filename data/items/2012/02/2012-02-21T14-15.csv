That kind of thing seems something that a third-party would create and there are a large number of them out there. The main thing to remember was that the Flash intro, at one time, was an accepted practice. It was an easy way for a company to introduce itself, much like a commercial. It wasn't until it was overused that people started to dislike it and now people only remember disliking it.",1329836372

Once I thought you should learn from Ada's work and the looms all the way up to things like the Enigma machine, and jump into the things that started happening in the 50s research. Basically, grow your knowledge from the ground up and make all the same discoveries.<p>The other approach is to take a high-level fly by of concepts like strings. Most of us here on HN know that strings and how they work aren't as simple as presented in the 101 videos and there's so much more to know about them.<p>I'm concerned that this style of teaching (implementing concepts without understanding how they work) is also the style that's lead to a lot of confusion in my personal learning experience as I progressed. Once upon a time everything in the browser like HTTP and rendering was magic and I wrote sloppy web apps. In a similar vein, I never really ""got"" calculus until I read a book that explained the history of how Newton made up ""infinitesimals"", Leibniz made up ""derivatives"" and someone else made up limits. I had no idea how calculus worked until I understood the origins... sure I could write differential equations based on some cheat-sheet, but that deep-rooted understanding never came along until I walked through Newton's shoes. And to be honest, it was simply the dy/dx notation that made no sense to me, and none of my teachers could explain it to me, it was always ""oh, that's the derivative of that axis value"" (might as well have said ""oh, a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors"").<p>On the other hand, learning and doing things without that deep understanding is exactly how I started programming and I turned out <i>okay.</i>",1329836370

3616637,comment,3616193,3616193,29,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"First, this is a five-year-old article. And a dupe.<p>Second, let's get definitions straight. Agile is best practices around iterative and incremental development. The word is a marketing term and can cover all sorts of different (and contradictory) concepts. Scrum is a certified way to manage Agile projects. You write a check, there's a board, a class, and a nice little certificate you get.<p>So it's really hard to jump up and down and yell too much about ""Agile"" -- the term is just too slippery. (I note he includes a picture of a ScrumMaster class) Or to put another way: ten years ago companies hired me because I was really good at running iterative and incremental projects and could not only do it well, but help train project managers and teams. Now the same companies hire me for the same reasons, but the word ""Agile"" is attached. If you want to slam all external consulting as being a waste of money, that's fine, but let's be clear what you're ranting about.<p>Second, because it's best practices, not all of them are going to work for you. And as you grow, you'll find out how to use some (and ignore others). Hell, I'm still struggling with TDD. But I grok pair-programming: it's the same kind of coding you did in college where a couple of people would sit around figuring out a problem. It combines the code review and the code creation into one step -- brings the review as far forward as possible, so there's no wait. Would I do pair programming all the time? Shit no, but does that mean I should make fun of it? Not unless I want to sound like an idiot in ten year's time.<p>The biggest point to be made here is that <i>Agile adoption is not the same as Agile principles</i>. Agile adoption sucks -- it's full of zealots, religious wars, highly-priced seminars, and feel-good happy talk. It can be just another way for management to micro-manage your project. The terms can mean different things to different people. Consultants make lots of money and provide very little value. And so on. Trust me, I know this: <a href=""http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2010/09/agile-ruined-my.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2010/09/agile-ruined-...</a><p>But all of that is just a study in how screwed up most organizations and movements are. Agile as a set of best practices is awesome. If I want to learn about data modeling, I'm buying some kind of book with a title like ""Agile data modeling"" because I know it's going to have an incremental and iterative context -- I won't have to do as much mental gymnastics to fit it into what I'm doing. (Disclaimer/shameless plug: I just published the first in a series of e-books to try to teach people without them having to pay so much for consulting. <a href=""http://tiny-giant-books.com/scrummaster.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiny-giant-books.com/scrummaster.htm</a>)<p>Agile adoption has generated a lot of hate. That's a shame, because as Steve points out, there's good in there too. (Although he's not hitting on a lot here, the article is nicely done)",1329836238

You then have to exploit it which means selling it on the deep web or (worse, time-wise) criminal black market, which is again illegal, and also a massive chore: you're doing something illegal but then making yourself highly visible/traceable and connecting with the wrong kind of people in order to profit from it illegally (sorry if this seems tautological, but it's worth repeating that it's two distinct acts to acquire the data and then to sell it). Yuck.<p>You're far better off playing the odds: each employee can call 60 people per day. Even if 1/200 signs up what are these people making? $25 per day? If you've got 5 people in the call centre nailing 1 in 200 customers then you've got a business, provided your overheads are low enough and you're using signed-up customers as a platform to sell to (referrals & 'security' software).<p>It's not going to make you rich quicker than a legitimate (and I use that word advisedly) botnet or key logger / zombie script, but you're pretty much on the right side of the law and there's very little downside if you're unscrupulous.<p>(The massive moral downside is that you're an utter cunt, of course.)<p>The thing which is strange to me here (or perhaps indicative of the fact that they're a useless outfit) is that they don't have the script nailed.<p>We're all (presumably) relatively proficient with computers here. I don't think I'd have any trouble at all in convincing someone that there's a virus or malicious code on their computer, if I wanted to. There are enough confusingly named but benign processes on OS X and Windows and enough ways to dress up a script to turn them off at launch and ""fix"" the computer. How many times did that guy stumble over his story? Malicious code; Windows licence; you pay; you don't pay; can we call you back; let me speak to legal; I can see your screen; I can't see your screen.<p>A more efficient scam would be a slicker script, a 10 minute process, and less deviation.

Recently, my mobile devices seem to have been getting more attention from me. Stats reveal that its a general trend these days. e-Commerce companies also know this. And hence all of them have a mobile version. Their theory seem to be; Get all the info of the main site, dumb it down, make the UX like its Y2K. Add a couple of dragging and zooming gesture and make it as difficult as possible to navigate through products (those tiny buttons)!<p>I hate this logic. First, why the dumb-down version? Its 2012, my phone is called a smartphone. It can't just drag like a resistive device, it can Tap,  Flick, Pinch, Spread, Press, hell it can even Rotate. Tired of these facts, being a hacker, I decided to stop wining and hack a mCommerce website. The Amazon of the mobile world. :)<p>The start was good. Being a JavaScript junkie; whose day job is in an Alexa 200 website; gave me the advantage to build a website really quick. The mobile UX was driven by my consumer instinct. I was building the shopping site to solve my problem of not having a rich shopping experience on my mobile devices. My store front was ready and it was driven by Flicks, Pinch, Taps, Double Taps and all of this by holding the phone with just one hand. Mobiles are to be used with one hand in my opinion, using two hands just make all the fingers feel awkward. It looses the personal connection. Anyhow, I was excited and was planing to finally invest in a designer to get the design polished. I suck at Photoshop. :(<p>This is where I went for advice from someone I respect for his ideas. He said and very quietly and calmly, ""You can do nothing, eCommerce is not about technology or UX, its all about warehousing!"" Yikes! Thats when it hit me; how and what would I sell? This is where my dream to change the mobile experience of shoppers shattered quietly and calmly. I don't have funds or the contacts to stock products. I know just how to hack.<p>This is where I am currently at. Not sure of what to do next. So I my question to all you Hackers is how do I now hack the mobile marketplace?<p>mBay (mobile eBay business model)? Partner someone? open-source the codebase? Sell the platform? or some other Awesome Hack?<p>P.S. - I am from India and would first like the site to start here and then go worldwide.",1329833983
3616483,comment,3616193,3616444,6,0,jerf,,,"My personal theory on XP, and to a lesser extent Agile, is that about 90%, if not 120%, of the benefit is in the pervasive use of automated testing, and the rest is either marginal in comparison, or even harmful but propped up by the benefit you scored by using automated testing so it all looks net positive in the end. (Hence the 120%; the benefit of just using automated testing is indeed greater than the whole package.)<p>I can't prove it. And I do like iterations in the sense of ""produce a deliverable product every N weeks"" for keeping you from wandering too far down the wrong path, though from what I've seen one of the most popular things to do with agile is just break your calender up by ""iterations"" then keep doing the same thing you did before. It's sort of hard to get a real sense of the utility of agile because hardly anybody really seems to really try it. (I do not necessarily think every aspect of it should be <i>kept</i>, but much of what it proposes is at least worth a real <i>try</i>.

3616443,comment,3615881,3615881,2,0,yrome78,,,"The phrase ""You have to start somewhere"" comes to mind. A CS degree is a more formal and substantial pursuit than what you may have picked up doing it yourself. Could you code without a degree? Of course. Are you very likely to be a better developer after completion? Yes.<p>I think a lot of it comes down to establishing a set of tools that can be used for whatever problem you encounter. No matter the language or the problem you want to have at least a vague idea of how it might actually work. Further, when you in inherit a code base, you want to have the tools to dig in  and find out how the thing works. And when problems arise, you want to be able to get inside the black box and ask things like ""Does this result make sense.""<p>A big missing piece in a CS degree is an understanding of the SDLC. The use of svn, tagging and build scripts is essential to any software development effort, and yet it is rarely mentioned. Creating elegant algorithms is great fun, but when the client is screaming that the code doesn't work and all you can say is ""works on my machine"", you'll wish you had the warm blanket of a proper build process.",1329833227

I'm sure the company is filled with intelligent and well-intentioned people.<p>But surely you must realize, you would have no idea if the security services had exerted some form of control over your company. If there is any control, and I'll insist there almost certainly is, there's a handful of people who know about it. And they won't tell you, because they are the very ones controlled and too concerned about their job, freedom or personal safety.<p>So while obviously you can't say that Yandex _is_ FSB, I'd say you can pretty much assume that Twitter giving some privileged access to its data to Yandex is equivalent to giving privileged access to Russian intelligence.<p>""Please, would you be so intelligent not to state things of which you are not sure?""\n- Well, if all we cared about were raw, 100% confirmed facts, we should abandon any form of discussion and just read news. For instance, what good is advice for entrepreneurs, when it's just conclusions and generalizations drawn from someone's narrow experience? No, the whole point of having a sensible discussion is to actually draw conclusions, challenge them and reassess.<p>And as I said earlier, Yandex is too important and too influential in the tech sphere (from Russian perspective) not to draw interest from the security services. Considering their enormous power and impunity, I find it almost certain that they would use Yandex for their own benefit. With appropriate care and discretion, of course, otherwise it defies the purpose.",1329833194

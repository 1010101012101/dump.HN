9883958,comment,9883882,9883882,0,0,OrangeTux,,,"TL;DR: Just start.<p>I&#x27;ve this too. When I learn something new like a language I often want to do it right, like be &quot;pythonic&quot; when learning Python. It can take long for me to write some simple piece of code because I&#x27;m constantly doubting if my code is pythonic. And when it takes to long I lose focus and I stop.<p>The same thing applies when I started a little Go web app, Go was rather new for me. I decided to use Docker and wanted to have a perfect solution with 3 containers(Nginx as reverse proxy , web app and API), auto rebuild and autoreload in developement mode etc. Than I started with writing in Go and everyone had to be tested perfectly, so I was looking for how to test things and how to run tests automatically after saving a file.<p>These things slowed me down to a point I where stopped. What did I want? I wanted to learn Go. What did I achieve? I learned how to create have production setup for a web app and api in Docker, I learned something about test suites in Go and I was frustrated because another learning project failed.<p>My advice, just start your project. You can&#x27;t do it perfect because you want to learn it!",1436871595

Coal is much more widely used than nuclear energy, so I&#x27;m not sure if they were used on the same amount which would have more casualties.<p>Not to mention that this depends on the country as well, since countries differ wildly in terms of workplace safety and the existence/enforcement of environmental standarts.<p>I would avoid repeating this claim.",1436871575

My old system has wireless sensors, but it uses traditional FM signaling which most computers/phones are unable to intercept (yeah, I dream of a phone with a good programmable software radio). An ideal solution would be Bluetooth LE sensors (door, motion, sirens etc) which I could monitor from an aged Android GSM phone (I can write the software myself if I have to).

In theory, that&#x27;s great because it is proven error-free. In practice, of course, implementing a &quot;correct program&quot; can introduce bugs and running it on a non-ideal machine (i.e. any physical computer), introduces uncertainties.<p>Furthermore, it is expensive to do: you need people with a strong understanding of mathematics/computer science, it is time intensive, and for most applications, just writing a program is good enough.

However, there&#x27;s some obvious wrenches in the plan for such quick adoption, including:<p>- No great options currently for charging in apartments. Virtually the entire world is on an urbanisation trend, so this segment of potential EV owners is really important for adoption, and isn&#x27;t being currently served.<p>- People replace their cars at much slower rates than smartphones.<p>I think there is a lot of potential for disruption in the transportation sector. Trucking companies and taxi fleets don&#x27;t care if their vehicles are big, ugly and heavy (as they would be if outfitted with batteries), cost is the main factor. When EV running costs dip below the cost of ICE vehicles (and when battery density improves the range sufficiently), these guys are going to have a huge incentive to invest in EVs quickly.<p>Also, if someone figures out how to build an electric jet in the next few decades, it will transform the airline industry who are currently held hostage by the price of oil. Perhaps airlines can compete on service rather than price gouging on &quot;extras&quot; that used to be covered by the cost of a ticket, to make up for razor thin margins.

Then add in diversions to acceptable charging stations.<p>Pure electrics are fine for metropolitan travel. When their recharge rate becomes very quick or an acceptable range extender; likely hydrogen; becomes available then they will have widerspread acceptance.<p>To be honest, outside of a small niche electric &quot;cars&quot; aren&#x27;t there yet. However there is no reason electric school buses aren&#x27;t worth the time. If you want acceptance to grow then employ the tech where everyone will see it and in a means you can sell on many levels.

Some of them have been tricked by fake web site pop-ups as a result, others ignore legitimate update messages. I do not blame them.<p>Internet Explorer and Google Chrome get updated in a way that most end users find to be simple to understand, particularly with Chrome. Firefox is also quite good in this regard. All of them are reliable - it is rare, IME, to come across a Windows Update, Firefox or Chrome instance which is silently failing to update. Or not even bothering to prompt to update.<p>Flash, however often I install it, just doesn&#x27;t seem to auto-update reliably. Quite often it only does so after a user log on/reboot, which doesn&#x27;t happen much in the days of standby. Even on brand new, fresh Windows installs (so we know the OS/Flash isn&#x27;t broken), I test Flash from time to time and it just doesn&#x27;t prompt to update at all on some occasions. This is what makes Adobe&#x27;s poor track record exponentially worse - that their software update mechanism is crap at best.<p>I was gobsmacked when Microsoft declared they were going to start updating Flash via Windows Update. Gobsmacked and so very relieved. It felt like they&#x27;d walked into Adobe&#x27;s office, grabbed their fire extinguishers and told them &quot;You are so useless that when there&#x27;s a fire, WE will come and put it out, since you don&#x27;t seem able to. We are sick of our offices getting burned down because of your idle incompetence.&quot;<p>I won&#x27;t even address Oracle&#x27;s Java. Bundling malware with their updater is tantamount to crime.",1436868078

I can basically guarantee that any large project will have large quantities of them, though, and that code will have bugs.<p>For that matter, Lisp is not programming; it's specifying a dataset.  Except, well, it actually is programming, because you can execute that dataset.  When you push it far enough, the distinction between code and data disappears.<p>This is probably an indication that software construction will never be ""solved"": once an acceptable representation has been found for one level of complexity, someone will quickly build on that and take it to the <i>next</i> level of complexity, and then the abstractions will once again prove inadequate.",1309337673

A useful thing is to be less wrong and to have a good handle for all the ways in which one might be through assumptions, approximations, systematic uncertainties and so on.

After a conversation is finished, others may forge messages to make them look like they came from you, but they cannot read the messages you originally sent. This gives you plausible deniability, which is what you want in most use cases (if you don't, then you're right that PGP is a better option).<p>The key exchange is susceptible to a man in the middle attack, which can be prevented by comparing fingerprints using a separate communication channel. Once compared, all future conversations should be impossible to intercept. If your private keys are ever found (a TSA official steals your laptop), they'll be unable to decrypt past conversations. Unless you've left conversation logging on in your chat client, of course.<p>I never thought much about using OTR until i logged into GMail and discovered reams and reams of OTR conversations stored in the chat logs. I never used the GMail Chat client, and this was a real eye-opener for me. Had I not been using OTR, Google would have stored a couple of years worth of conversations between my friends and kept them forever.<p>By the way, ZFone / ZRTP (<a href=""http://zfoneproject.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zfoneproject.com/</a>) is a protocol using similar ideas, but for VoIP calls.",1309334905

The deniability aspect is that either participant can generate messages in the same session.  Alice receiving X from Bob knows that either Alice or Bob wrote X (assuming the session secret stays secret).  Alice cannot prove to Carol that Bob wrote X because Alice's inference of this is dependent on local knowledge that Alice did not write X.",1309334740

The new hosted MySQL monitoring service is available immediately.<p>Our new MySQL monitoring service ensures high availability of database servers and performs a host of tasks to ensure MySQL is running smoothly, said Monitis Founder and CEO Hovhannes Avoyan. And because MySQL is the most popular database in use today, perhaps never before can so many system administrators get so much for free.<p>The service works with a tiny Linux software agent that can monitor inside an organizations firewall and distributed systems. The Monitor.Us agent connects to a local or remote database, collects a variety of health and performance metrics and submits the information to the Monitor.Us platform. Users can view the information in real-time graphics on a web-based dashboard. Users can also set up notifications (should their database go down or pass a certain level of access volume) based on client-defined thresholds and rules.<p>Some metrics tracked and reported on by Monitor.Uss free MySQL service -- which can be set up in minutes -- include:<p>	Database size\n	Resource utilization\n	Analysis of responsiveness/latency\n	Analysis of throughput \n	Database usage\n	Scalability<p>These metrics can also be studied alongside other server health monitoring information that Monitor.Us offers, for example, CPU and RAM.<p>The metrics for any database revolve around responsiveness of the system, throughput and scalability, said Avoyan. Our MySQL database monitoring service offers these and many more kinds of metrics, and thus assists with all kinds of user goals.<p>For example, for multiple users, the measuring of throughput metrics is key, while monitoring response time and latency is just what system administrators need for heavy job execution, continued Avoyan. For resource planning, the scalability metrics -- such as database size, load, concurrent connections, threads and locks -- would be top-of-the list.<p>With Monitor.Uss free MySQL service, administrators can monitor both raw and calculated MySQL performance data.<p>No matter which metric youre looking at, the bottom line is that our hosted MySQL health and peformance monitoring is a tremendously convenient new tool to help system administrators not only quickly react to issues arising, but also to prevent them in the first place, said Avoyan.<p>Sign-up free at http://monitor.us/free_signup.jsp<p>About Monitor.Us\nMonitor.Us is the worlds first free all-in-one Cloud-based server monitoring service, providing both external (measuring application uptime and end-user experience) and internal server resources monitoring (tracking used disk space, RAM, CPU, traffic). Monitor.Us is faster and cheaper than even free monitoring software, as there is no need to setup and maintain a monitoring server. Monitor.Us is a part of the Monitis family of monitoring applications.<p>About Monitis\nMonitis believes that the Cloud is the biggest thing to happen in IT management since IT management. Having seen this vision early, Monitis is now the global leader in developing this market.  It is the first affordable network and systems monitoring solution based 100% in the Cloud. Besides Monitis enthusiastic and loyal user base of 70,000 customers from small businesses to Fortune 500 companies to government agencies and educational institutions, Monitis has won rave reviews from the technology analyst community, such as Most Innovative Start-Up from The 451 Group, a listing in OnDemand 100, a ranking by Morgan Stanley, KPMG, and AlwaysOn, of 100 top private companies globally.<p>For more information, contact:\nMonitis Inc.\nSales & Marketing Department\nsales@monitis.com\nhttp://www.monitis.com\nUS & Canada Toll Free:               \n+1-800-657-7949",1309334680

Some of the newer ideas I know of are BDD, internal DSLs, and the importing of ideas from functional programming.<p>My question is: is there any consensus on the best way to develop object-oriented software today in the more modern languages such as C#, Ruby, and Python? And what are those practices? For instance, I rather like the idea of stateless objects but how many are actually using that in practice?<p>Or, is the state of the art to deemphasize the importance of OOP? This might be the case for some Python programmers but would be difficult for Rubyists.",1309334476

This means that to one player they appear indistinguishable, so the same strategy is played in all of them, while the other players might still be able to distinguish them. If your game has a huge state space it&#x27;s likely that some of the state just hardly matters some of the time to some of the opponents. Other methods of fusing states have the disadvantage that all players have to care about the same information.<p>To implement MCTS with information sets, use the Information Set MCTS algorithm (ISMCTS) [1], which is a pretty obvious and intuitive extension of MCTS. (Has nobody really described ISMCTS before?)

Each piece of land is unique because of it&#x27;s location, so other bits of land won&#x27;t do. For example, starting a business on the high street. You can&#x27;t just get a cheap piece of land elsewhere and move it to the location you want it to be in, whereas you can do this with all of the other supplies you need. This makes land a de facto monopoly. The consumer has no choice and allowing people to own more than they need is damaging to capitalism.<p>What really happens instead is that the consumer is left competing with other consumers to get the bit of land they need. Each location is effectively an auction for a unique item. In starting a business, rival entrepreneurs will continue to outbid one another until they are left with only just enough profit for it to be worth it. Bidding less means a rival will outbid them and they won&#x27;t get the land they need. Bidding more means the business is not viable. In this way, the landlord does not and cannot set the price themselves. The market decides. They can try to raise the rent, but the business owner will then not be making enough profit for it to be worth it, so they will either refuse or shut down.<p>The is counter intuitive, but well researched.

Moreover, if land ownership is highly concentrated then releasing very little of that land for rentals and gradually selling off the highest-value parcels probably is the most effective way of maximising the value of one&#x27;s dynasty&#x27;s land portfolio.<p>The argument isn&#x27;t so much that rents would never go up at all as that the effects of more efficient land use and competition in the rentals market mean that individual occupants of the land wouldn&#x27;t pay the <i>full</i> value of the tax (and would tend to benefit from commensurate rate reductions on other taxes)<p>How well that argument explains or even fits the facts of land ownership varies hugely by geography.",1442150670

Implicit form is naturally associated with a different point of view: the set of points that satisfy a certain relation.<p>Functions of the form<p>y = f(x)<p>can be easily re-expressed in parametric form:<p>(t, f(t))<p>or implicit form<p>y - f(x) = 0<p>so both the parametric viewpoint and the implicit viewpoint are equally valid and useful ways of understanding the graph of a function.

For example, it&#x27;s easy to find a point on a parametric curve, but hard to test if a point is on a parametric curve; on the contrary, it is hard to find a point on an implicit curve, and easy to test if a point is on an implicit curve.

10211253,comment,10204255,10207312,0,0,mcguire,,,"The whole Forward is too long to fit in the margins of this forum. Here seems to me to be the likely section:<p>The Lord of the Rings has been read by many people since it finally\nappeared in print; and I should like to say something here with\nreference to the many opinions or guesses that I have received or have\nread concerning the motives and meaning of the tale. The prime motive\nwas the desire of a tale-teller to try his hand at a really long story\nthat would hold the attention of readers, amuse them, delight them, and\nat times maybe excite them or deeply move them. As a guide I had only my\nown feelings for what is appealing or moving, and for many the guide was\ninevitably often at fault. Some who have read the book, or at any rate\nhave reviewed it, have found it boring, absurd, or contemptible; and I\nhave no cause to complain, since I have similar opinions of their works,\nor of the kinds of writing that they evidently prefer. But even from the\npoints of view of many who have enjoyed my story there is much that\nfails to please. It is perhaps not possible in a long tale to please\neverybody at all points, nor to displease everybody at the same points;\nfor I find from the letters that I have received that the passages or\nchapters that are to some a blemish are all by others specially\napproved. The most critical reader of all, myself, now finds many\ndefects, minor and major, but being fortunately under no obligation\neither to review the book or to write it again, he will pass over these\nin silence, except one that has been noted by others: the book is too\nshort.<p>As for any inner meaning or &#x27;message&#x27;, it has in the intention of the\nauthor none. It is neither allegorical nor topical. As the story grew it\nput down roots (into the past) and threw out unexpected branches: but\nits main theme was settled from the outset by the inevitable choice of\nthe Ring as the link between it and The Hobbit. The crucial chapter,\n&quot;The Shadow of the Past&#x27;, is one of the oldest parts of the tale. It was\nwritten long before the foreshadow of 1939 had yet become a threat of\ninevitable disaster, and from that point the story would have developed\nalong essentially the same lines, if that disaster had been averted. Its\nsources are things long before in mind, or in some cases already\nwritten, and little or nothing in it was modified by the war that began\nin 1939 or its sequels.<p>The real war does not resemble the legendary war in its process or its\nconclusion. If it had inspired or directed the development of the\nlegend, then certainly the Ring would have been seized and used against\nSauron; he would not have been annihilated but enslaved, and Barad-dûr\nwould not have been destroyed but occupied. Saruman, failing to get\npossession of the Ring, would in the confusion and treacheries of the\ntime have found in Mordor the missing links in his own researches into\nRing-lore, and before long he would have made a Great Ring of his own\nwith which to challenge the self-styled Ruler of Middle-earth. In that\nconflict both sides would have held hobbits in hatred and contempt: they\nwould not long have survived even as slaves.<p>Other arrangements could be devised according to the tastes or views of\nthose who like allegory or topical reference. But I cordially dislike\nallegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew\nold and wary enough to detect its presence. I much prefer history, true\nor feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and experience\nof readers. I think that many confuse &#x27;applicability&#x27; with &#x27;allegory&#x27;;\nbut the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the\npurposed domination of the author.<p>An author cannot of course remain wholly unaffected by his experience,\nbut the ways in which a story-germ uses the soil of experience are\nextremely complex, and attempts to define the process are at best\nguesses from evidence that is inadequate and ambiguous. It is also\nfalse, though naturally attractive, when the lives of an author and\ncritic have overlapped, to suppose that the movements of thought or the\nevents of times common to both were necessarily the most powerful\ninfluences. One has indeed personally to come under the shadow of war to\nfeel fully its oppression; but as the years go by it seems now often\nforgotten that to be caught in youth by 1914 was no less hideous an\nexperience than to be involved in 1939 and the following years. By 1918\nall but one of my close friends were dead. Or to take a less grievous\nmatter: it has been supposed by some that &#x27;The Scouring of the Shire&#x27;\nreflects the situation in England at the time when I was finishing my\ntale. It does not. It is an essential part of the plot, foreseen from\nthe outset, though in the event modified by the character of Saruman as\ndeveloped in the story without, need I say, any allegorical significance\nor contemporary political reference whatsoever. It has indeed some basis\nin experience, though slender (for the economic situation was entirely\ndifferent), and much further back. The country in which I lived in\nchildhood was being shabbily destroyed before I was ten, in days when\nmotor-cars were rare objects (I had never seen one) and men were still\nbuilding suburban railways. Recently I saw in a paper a picture of the\nlast decrepitude of the once thriving corn-mill beside its pool that\nlong ago seemed to me so important. I never liked the looks of the Young\nmiller, but his father, the Old miller, had a black beard, and he was\nnot named Sandyman.",1442149511

I doubt that many or even any serious physicist imagine something of infinite density inside a black hole, infinities are just the way our theories tell us that we don&#x27;t understand things well enough and got the math wrong. The event horizon can be a very ordinary place with almost flat space and no strong gravitational forces. You can probably cross the event horizon of a large black hole without even noticing what you just did and that you are doomed. So imagining that the event horizon is kind of a wall with nothing behind the wall most likely does not work. Lastly the singularity is not a place but a time, the common pictures of black holes are highly inadequate to think about black holes.",1442149296

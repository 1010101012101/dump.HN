Hashbang puts content retrieval into the client rather than a browser being a simple receiver (with js functionality applied, natch). This was a major architectural change for them and this whole fiasco points to a lack of foresight and, possibly, experience.<p>I'm guessing that sometime in the last year, someone at Gawker Consolidated Industries took the lead on doing this thing that Facebook and Twitter are doing and hey, if all the cool kids are doing it, why not us? Well, for one thing Gawker doesn't have the zillions of dollars to pay for the talent that FB and Twit have to ensure that the project is a success. Furthermore, given the money, whether Gawk would be able to detect and hire the talent required to make this change a success is left as an exercise for the reader. Even if they tried to cherry-pick technical talent from the companies hashbanging successfully, how many of us would jump from FB/Tw/Goog to...<i>Gawker</i>? I smell hubris.<p>I can't say the same thing wouldn't have happened if I personally tried to implement it, but I'm not Nick Denton or whoever the nepotistic minion is being protected here. The funny thing is that TC was ALL OVER Twitter when they were having problems, calling people out by name for decidedly smaller problems.<p>Lastly, I don't know if this would ever be possible in the business world, but it might be smart to (try to) put some kind of clawback or breakup provision in the kinds of agreements sites like Gawk have with its subsites where  ownership reverts if the parent fails to thrive and traffic/usage falls below pre-agreement levels.

2468525,comment,2466290,2466290,4,0,SeanLuke,,,"Sadly, it's three editions and AIMA is still hopeless regarding stochastic optimization (genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, ant colony optimization, hill climbing, and the like), and gradient-based optimization.<p>It seems they don't want to be bothered about the significant difference between search and optimization.  So they stick all the stochastic optimization stuff into a section called ""local search and optimization"", and place it underneath the Search chapter (it's not search, and almost none of it is local).  And then separate out optimization methods like gradient descent etc., placing them under ""local search in continuous spaces"", as if (1) they were search and (2) stochastic optimization wasn't applied to continuous spaces.<p>And if this wasn't muddled enough, their recommended books for stochastic optimization aren't under the Search chapter at all -- they've been placed under the Machine Learning chapter.  And it's a strange collection.<p>I'm pretty disappointed with AIMA's seemingly poor understanding of this area.

2468485,comment,2463305,2466527,1,0,bad_user,,,"@nuclear_eclipse, look up this thread and you'll see that the discussion started from a mention of meta-programming. Also, IMHO, reflection (per se) is basically useless in a dynamically-typed language, unless you also have the ability to redefine stuff.<p><pre><code>    I've never really found myself in a situation where\n    rebinding or extending classes at runtime was really \n    the best solution.\n</code></pre>\nThat's only because you aren't used to it, and you're dismissing it based only on a limited experience with what is possible; although the libraries you're using may be doing it without you even noticing it.<p>If you're a Java developer, what do you think frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, Guice are doing?<p>And why in the world would you be using dynamic-typing if everything was set in stone from compile-time? Structural-typing (like in Scala) works a lot better ; although I can see why there's a misconception about what dynamic-typing really enables.<p>That's the thing with half-baked features -- of course they are hard to use and error prone when the language itself isn't really built around it. But in a language like Ruby, where the ""class"" block's main purpose is to open a scope where ""self"" (the implicit) parameter points to that class, and inside the definition you can put anything, like real code that does stuff, and where creating new classes (in case they don't exist) is just a side-effect -- modifying classes and objects at runtime is everything you're doing (whether you like it or not). But it does give you the tools to deal with it.<p>Same thing happens with Python, but more with functions and class methods, rather than classes, because that's what Python was optimized for -- decorating functions with extra behavior, since functions are first-class citizens.<p>In Python it doesn't work so well for classes, since inside the definition itself you don't have access to ""self"", but you can also patch classes with great effect, just not with so much syntactic-sugar as in Ruby -- that's why people shy away from it and choose to deal with functions/methods instead, although there is some cool meta-programming stuff done with classes in Django.<p>That's what decorators do btw (which look similar to Java annotations, but have a lot more bang for the buck :)) -- <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/</a><p><pre><code>    I would actually be quite interested in seeing \n    a usage of that sort of magic\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://rubyonrails.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rubyonrails.org/</a> -- and really, don't be fooled by all the clones available. I worked with Symfony and CakePHP -- every Rails-clone sucks compared to Rails. You have to try it for real in order to see what it does differently.<p>If you're a fan of Java: <a href=""http://aspectwerkz.codehaus.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aspectwerkz.codehaus.org/</a><p>See that link above? -- that's so easy to do in Python/Ruby that it doesn't deserve a library ;-)<p>This is a good read on Ruby's meta-programming facilities, while not being so hard to read btw: <a href=""http://pragprog.com/titles/ppmetr/metaprogramming-ruby"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pragprog.com/titles/ppmetr/metaprogramming-ruby</a><p>Also, terms like ""monkey-patching"" and ""magic"" are derogatory terms for good engineering practices people have been using since the 70-ties when generating assembly at runtime was the only reasonable way to make complicated algorithms to work, while maintaining some sanity, like those in the field of artificial-intelligence.<p>In the meantime people got so obsessed with preventing employees from shooting themselves in the foot, that aberrations like C++ and Java happened.

Paying 0.99 - 2.00 per track when I used to pay $10+ per vinyl with 1-2 tracks is fantastic.  I think the trick with content is producing high-quality content - this is something people will pay for - and making it stupid easy to attain (This is why P2P music-movie sharing really took off. No need for figuring out FTP or other mechanisms/tools for the layman. Just search and download).  I believe the success of the Kindle and the Apple App Store prove this point - it's drop dead stupid simple.  Search and download, payment is done in the background.  On the news side I'll give an example as well. If my local paper would stop reproducing AP stories and did real investigative journalism on local issues I would gladly pony up for the content.

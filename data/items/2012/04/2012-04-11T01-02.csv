My co-founder and I were originally working on a previous project that we ended up ditching and then we started brainstorming business ideas, many of which we submitted in the last YC application. This guy knew we were searching and yet every time we met he just kept giving us all the details of his website/app and how it would make money etc. This was all informal with no NDAs or anything.<p>Two months ago I would have never thought of stealing his idea, but a few weeks ago this guy and his partner fell through and he's now alone. I don't even think he can put this thing together and I don't think he's going to anymore even though he claims so. Given that our last venture failed, and in light of this development we're seriously considering stealing his idea. We can actually execute this idea really fast and have a pretty ingenious way to promote it too.<p>But we're not jerks. We feel it's wrong to do this without telling the guy. And we don't want him in our team neither. He's so passionate about his project that he probably wouldn't want to change anything, such as the name which is really lame. In terms of skills he's technical but probably wouldn't be able to code everything himself, especially the back end. But he does have a bit of money though, so he could help us bootstrap.<p>We need advise! What should we do? Secretly develop it similar to Mark Zuck, be honest and upfront or partner up?<p>How many of you have actually stolen other ideas or gotten their ideas stolen?<p>Thanks for your responses!",1334109078

Is this going to be able to handle thousands of simultaneous connections? Is the Node server built on anything else like Socket.IO, or is it fully new and unique code?<p>2) How does this handle conflicts? ShareJS implements Operational Transformation[2] to attempt to smartly handle conflicting writes from multiple clients (used in Google Wave, for example). Does this just do a simple timestamp-based overwrite? If so, how far down the tree? I'm not familiar with MongoDB (sorry), but would it be at the object level?

So you've shifted your scaling problems from an area that programmers understand and control to a 1-MLOC mystery.<p>True, however in my experience it's pretty easy to scale the database layer.  One beefy DB server can easily handle 2 or 3 front end servers with even mild caching.  If you get aggressive in the caching strategy, one DB server can handle up to 10 front end boxes.  And if you need to scale beyond that, replication is a well understood paradigm (sure, not by normal app developers, but there's plenty of resources out there).<p>> I bring this up because I have a few friends who make their living saving the asses of PHP programmers who buy the notion that PHP is magically easy to scale.<p>I never said that it was magically able to scale.

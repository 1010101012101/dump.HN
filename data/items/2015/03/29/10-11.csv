MirageOS takes a clean-slate approach and generally concerns itself with safety and security. OSv allows you to work with legacy code, and Rump Kernels help to break up the existing stacks. There are also others that have a preference for speed etc. Depending on the task at hand, you could choose whichever suits your needs/problem-domain.<p>The upfront cost you refer to only comes from having to port legacy code.

On a standard railway platform, leaving late because some passengers hold up the train is a nuisance. With systems such as these, it is lethal.<p>For the EU one, the critical timing is in detaching from the fast train. It _has_ to happen before the two tracks split up.<p>For the Chinese one, detaching can be postponed indefinitely, if slow cars in front know it soon enough, and can pull up fast enough. I think that makes this system slightly safer. Worst-case, an emergency command &#x27;all trains to full speed&#x27; will &#x27;just&#x27; move most passengers to stations a few hundred miles from where they wanted to go.<p>In either case, I would expect that, to guarantee proper timing of detachment, the doors between fast and slow trains would have to close at least a minute, probably more, before separation. For the EU design, that means long side-by-side tracks. For the Chinese one, it limits the distance between stops of the docking train. One could solve that by allowing two slower trains to dock at the same time, but that increases the risk of collisions tremendously (two half-width trains docking side by side might be the best solution here)",1427624665

The Arduino &#x27;ecosystem&#x27; was confusing before this, now with this infighting it has become a total clusterfuck.<p>So, what alternatives are there? I need a simple, very cheap and very lower power chip that I can program easily using a regular PC and that can interface with a few optocouplers. Would it make sense to go directly for an ATmega? Or would I need additional circuitry to make that work? If I can program in C that would be OK, I don&#x27;t need the software to be &#x27;easy to use&#x27; - the hardware I&#x27;m unfamiliar with though so that needs to be plug and play.",1427623617

The additional financial aid I received saved my family and me more than $100k -- that figure would be much higher if we factor in the interest on the loans I didn&#x27;t have to take -- and I will be forever grateful.  I applaud Stanford for expanding this program.<p>But I&#x27;m also a little sad about the way this is playing out, because the net effect is to set the top private universities even further apart from the many great universities that nonetheless can&#x27;t afford policies like this.  There&#x27;s already so much pressure on a lot of kids to get into a top private university, and now many of them are in a position where if they don&#x27;t get into one of the top four, their only option is a public school.  (And yes, there exist public schools, such as Cal, which one can argue deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as H/P/Y/S, but certainly there isn&#x27;t a UC Berkeley in every state, and going to a public school out of state can be as expensive as going to a private school.)<p>If you really want to be sad, take a look at how short is the list of schools with need-blind admission that claim to meet all demonstrated need:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need-blind_admission#U.S._institutions_that_are_need-blind_for_U.S._applicants_and_meet_full_demonstrated_need"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need-blind_admission#U.S._insti...</a><p>This is a supremely low bar, because schools get to define how much you need; there&#x27;s no standard for this.  And of course schools can meet your need with loans.  But even still, the schools on this list are the only ones in the country which even claim to be meritocratic in their admission of US applicants.",1427623523

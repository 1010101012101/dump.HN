Both versions are free software. They store password entries in a single AES-encrypted container, use in-RAM encryption and allow you to attach a file with arbitrary binary data to each password entry (handy for key files). While there is no single Firefox extension that works across all the platforms they both can emulate typing for password entry. For synchronization I keep the encrypted password file in my Dropbox. If your use case is similar to mine I can highly recommend this solution because it behaves consistently across the platforms I've tried it on [3].

5348445,comment,5347936,5347936,5,0,nzonbi,,,"I wonder what kind of future expect the late entrants FirefoxOS and Ubuntu. I wish success for both. The challenge is big. They lack the momentum and big pockets of established rivals, Apple, Google and Microsoft. But there are some interesting factors that would be in their favor.<p>First are the apps. As for Ubuntu, developers love Linux. That would help to get apps ported. Plus Ubuntu have the recently introduced webapps integration, that provides unity integration for selected webapps. I expect that they will improve this feature, and include more apps. Then there is the choice of QT as the UI toolkit. This is a good choice, because QT is proven and has a big community of developers.<p>Meanwhile FirefoxOS relies on the traditional web platform, a popular and accessible environment for developers, that is currently improving relatively fast. The web, enhanced with the mobile APIs that Mozilla is working on, is probably enough for almost all productivity apps. And with webGL, it is becoming good for decent gaming. Web development has the advantage of being portable across platforms. That lower costs. And it is relatively easier and cheaper to find developers for it. These are facts that should not be ignored.<p>So both Ubuntu and FirefoxOS, are offering an attractive development proposition. From a pure development standpoint, I much rather prefer both Ubuntu and FirefoxOS alternatives, than Android Java or Apple objetiveC.<p>There is a strategical factor: Android device manufacturers fear Google. It is the most powerful web company in the world, controls Android, and also owns Motorola. So it competes with device manufacturers. That is too much power. And who knows if it decides to become like Apple at some point. So device manufactures, should be open to examine alternatives, as a countermeasure against Google excessive power.\nBoth Ubuntu and Mozilla are solid software companies, that seems unthinkable to become device manufactures.<p>As for windows, I can imagine device manufactures waking up from nightmares, screaming at midnight. Dreaming about a mobile world dominated by Microsoft, where they would have to pay a big fee for each windows license, out of their thin margins. It is also relevant the interest of big third-parties. Big players like Facebook and Amazon, would feel more comfortable, if their apps were running on OSs not property of their rivals, Google, Apple and Microsoft. Where these could implement strategies, to undermine the former.<p>Linux as a gaming platform is on the rise. Steam, the Ouya, Nvidia project shield, etc. There are more incentives to consider games for Linux. Making porting to Ubuntu mobile easier and more enticing. And webGL appears poised for a brilliant future. So both FirefoxOS and Ubuntu could be good gaming platforms.<p>I hope that with the help of these factors, they at least can establish a sustainable presence on the market, and are able to build from there. I would be happier with a world where open OSs are present on the mobile market.",1362839018

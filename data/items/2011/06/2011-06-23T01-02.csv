2686315,comment,2684953,2685301,2,0,nkassis,,,"I don't buy this at all. First of all, the GPU is a sandboxed environment. I don't know of way to successfully go from shader code on the GPU to actually take over a machine and get elevated privlidges.<p>Secondly, Flash (and I believe Silverlight) will also be allowing users to provide shaders that flash will compile to  native languages for GPUs. Which WebGL implementation currently out there do also, they compile the shaders first, check them and test them. (Check out the Angle project). While none of these things eliminate the risks, they are steps in securing the technology and more work is being done to make WebGL as safe as it can be.<p>The fear that shaders provided by the server can lock up your gpu en in effect crash your computer are also something that is being addressed. There was an article by Gregg Tavares that explained how on Windows, it's possible to time the operation on the GPU and reset the GPU if it takes too long to respond.<p>As far as running code at elevated privileges. I don't see how that's true. First of all, the browser is running this code in a process that has no access to the file system, other process etc. Drivers are mostly user space with a little bit of kernel space code. I'm sure the risks do exists that that level but again, securing this level should already be something Microsoft be working on and forcing Nvidia/ATI/Intel to do the same. And this isn't exactly an easy hack to do regardless, you have to code stuff for a wide range of drivers to make your hacks effective and also manage to get a lot of people to visit your site.<p>The worse case here is Intel graphics that use the CPU for some of the work. In this case a bug could be used to execute abitrary code and hack the machine.<p>I hope I don't sound like I'm saying that the security issues don't exists. What I'm trying to say is while they are there, there is work to fix them and render WebGL safe. WebGL just came out, if in 2-3 years it turns into the hell that ActiveX was then I'll agree it was a bad idea but so far I don't see this getting anywhere close to that level.",1308794362

2686313,comment,2684620,2685298,27,0,jmulho,,,"Oracle costs at least twice as much as any other databases.  Yet companies still buy it.  Why do people buy things that cost twice as much?  Hint: it's better.<p>Forget price for a moment, any feelings you might have for Larry Ellison, the good/evil nature of the company, or whatever.  Consider the software itself.<p>Many people aren't all that familiar with the basic things a database is supposed to do.  The list is large.  I can't possibly give it justice off the top of my head, but here are a few that come to mind: make it possible to see data in a consistent state (as of a single point in time), without being blocked, even as other people are changing it; support ""transactions"" -- a group of requests that either all succeed or all fail -- so that the database cannot end up in an inconsistent state; guarantee recoverability to a consistent state even when people change their minds, statements fails, power fails, hardware fails, or all of these things happen at the same time; and many, many other things like security, support for the relational model, SQL, joins, etc.  Real databases aren’t simple key-value stores.<p>Historically, Oracle obtained a huge lead in market share because it delivered the most complete mix of these basic things long before anyone else.<p>Something not widely recognized, but that should be obvious to programmers, is that low-level architectural decisions have a huge impact on how well a database performs these basic duties.  Oracle maintained its lead for a long time because it got many of the low-level architectural decisions right.  It is really hard to catch Oracle if you are trying to polish up a bad locking model, for example.  Oracle still does the basics better than most.  That, in and of itself, is a reason to consider Oracle.<p>Oracle remains viable, even as others continue to catch up, because Oracle builds on its solid foundation by adding additional capability and features relentlessly.  I challenge you to read the new features guide for any new release of Oracle and to remember just the names of 20% of the new features.  The Oracle documentation, as of 6 or 8 years ago (10g), was 40,000 pages.  No telling what it is now.  I can tell you this.  If you have something you need to do with databases, Oracle probably figured out how to do it a long time ago.<p>I, personally, am a huge fan of PostgreSQL (and it’s freeness), but I recognize that Postgres is never going to be able to touch Oracle in features.  It’s impossible.  Working with Postgres is just going to require a lot more manual labor.  Some things aren’t going to be possible.  Performance may just have to suffer sometimes.  Let’s hope Postgres does the basics well (it does).  That’s the most important thing.  But when it comes to building spacial indexes on hierarchical dimensions, or whatever, Postgress just isn’t going to have a feature for that.  I’ll have to figure that one out for myself.<p>One key point: if you need to build a large, high-performance, data-driven application that provides nearly instantaneous response for thousands of simultaneous users, Oracle is one option that can get the job done.  If you need to build something huge, say billions of rows, that provides nearly instantaneous response to dozens of users, Oracle is one option that can get that job done.  So no wonder that some companies consider Oracle.<p>The last thing I’ll mention is that it takes a lot of time to learn something like Oracle.  I would be surprised if after a year of using it, for example, that you can really make it hum better than any of its top competitors.  If you do use it for a while I think you’ll find that it is really good at the normal things and in a different league when it comes to the unusual things.  This comes in handy when you are being paid to get things done (by a company that can afford Oracle) -- hence the reason that most startup-oriented people don't have much appreciation for Oracle.",1308794315

2686300,comment,2686142,2686142,3,0,cher,,,"I'm about to turn 30 years very shortly here, so this is from my perspective.  Years ago, after college, I spent most of my traveling around various places in the world across all of the continents, trying my hand at a few businesses, some which worked and some which some failed miserably, and chasing women.  I think if you travel, chase money, and chase women, all in equal balance with none at the expenses of the other, you will most likely not have any regrets ten years from now unless you get a girl pregnant, then all bets are off.  As you progress in age, you may learn to make the mix more efficient by realizations such as ""if you are successful chasing money, you spend much less time chasing women, as they then chase you"". Money and women have been sought after by men for thousands of years, and while today's modern intellectual man may find it simplistic and barbaric, there is nothing wrong with satiating your appetite for what you were naturally programmed to do, be an animal.  You can learn a lot from rappers, they have the basic idea figured out.  Knock the top few layers off Maslow's hierarchy of needs and you have a higher likelihood of being happy.

You're acting like he did something abhorrent, or should think he did.<p>> my naivety caused me to assume that people playing with bitcoin were mostly just cryto geeks.<p>They are. But you're trying to say ""... and I'm surprised one of them would be thiefly, like this guy.""<p>Really, all this shows is that he should have transferred all the bitcoins out immediately. Then mtgox would have to deal with him instead of just slandering him. Now that he's pointed everything out to them he's just a scapegoat.",1308791158
2686175,comment,2684620,2685806,5,0,nirvdrum,,,"I'm a longtime Postgres guy, but I've used MySQL on a few sizable projects.  MySQL has come a long way over the years, such that a lot of my original criticisms are no longer valid.  My reasons for not using it this day are mainly lack of transactional DDL and the fact that adding indices require a full table lock.  There are some interesting solutions to the latter problem that the Percona guys have pulled together, but Postgres handles it all out of the box.  Things like partial and expression indices are icing on the cake.",1308791145

Currently, I'm sitting on my couch writing this while doing research on a ""big"" startup idea I have, but during the school year, I attend Georgetown. Over the summer, I'll be at Oxford taking a few classes and traveling around Europe a little. \nAfter school, I'm really undecided on what I will do. I would much rather prefer to start my own venture, but the $$$ and relative safety of big corporations are big incentives to defect. I'm really glad I have another 2 years to figure it out.<p>What are you currently/hoping to do?",1308791103

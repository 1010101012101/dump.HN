Whats interesting is that the EU is trying its hardest to emulate those issues without actually ascending to an empire itself. They are copying an empire in decline.

5160166,comment,5158449,5159946,4,0,mpyne,,,"> Does anyone remember the ease with which Bradley Manning performed his hack?<p>You're right that the military is hardly going to treat a ""Public Affairs"" website with any special care, but I wanted to correct you on your description of a Bradley Manning ""hack"".<p>There was no hack. There was never a hack. Bradley Manning was the proverbial ""insider"" threat.<p>You may remember that in the wake of 9/11 there was a lot of acrimony regarding how poorly the various Federal agencies worked together. They often engaged in turf warfare to maximize the agency's important instead of maximizing the U.S.'s ability to respond to actual threats.<p>No one shared info with one another, either because they were not sure they <i>could</i> share info, to prevent aiding other agencies getting more powerful, etc. And as a result there were thousands of Americans murdered, not to mention the horrific property losses.<p>So, one of the ""lessons learned"" was that the intelligence agencies were going to work together from then on. Not just work together, they were going to share the intel. Counterterrorism would become a real mission goal, with real resources put to it, real organizations aligned around it, etc.<p>So suddenly, military was working with CIA, FBI, Dept. of State, and more, and <i>working together</i> to prevent another 9/11 happening, prevent IED attacks against deployed troops, etc.<p>There was never a hack. Manning had access to all of that data quite intentionally, to help him <i>do his f'ing job</i> as an intelligence specialist analyzing the various Islamist threat groups in his area. He even quoted (and was quite proud of) an award citation in his chat logs with Lamo that described how he was aiding the Army in that particular fight.<p>But not once did he hack anything. He downloaded data he had authorized access to, and exfiltrated it to persons who did not have authorization.",1359910753

5160147,comment,5158936,5159993,4,0,unalone,,,"Yeah, see, this is the sort of argument that even freshmen College Democrats think isn't worth arguing.<p>Yeah, my computer's a result of that capitalistic model. That computer was made in a factory that attracted a lot of controversy for having working conditions so poor that employees literally killed themselves. That factory is the result of a line of thinking that dates back to Henry Ford, which is: let's find <i>exactly</i> the price that we can pay people to get them doing monotonous, soul-deadening work for eight to sixteen hours a day without them walking out. And the more these factories become the norm, the less we'll have to pay, because the fewer other places they can go.<p>What amuses me about this is that I am <i>not</i> a radical critic of capitalism. As far as people who think capitalism's less than perfect goes, I am so far along being okay with capitalism that my radical friends make fun of me for it. Your treating me like I'm some idiot who doesn't know the first thing about history suggests you haven't had many conversations about this, because trust me, nothing I'm saying is controversial in the least.<p>The way I see it, capitalism is a very sensible model for creating new things, for innovating, for encouraging systematic change in the directions of optimization and consumer satisfaction. But this model is only as effective, basically, as the freedoms which you're given within it  same as any system, right? In capitalism, the biggest threat is basically that those with the means of production and wealth hold all the reins, and they can inflict horrible suffering upon lots of people without punishment. I'm not just talking about paying people cruel wages to work at factories I'm talking TV networks producing terrible bottom-of-the-rung shows, and opposing competition from cable networks who'd like to offer quality programming. Or a music industry that is so determined to squeeze as much money as possible out of super-celebrity bands that it's hurt the ability of smaller, local bands to support themselves. The scale at which mass production operates is literally inhuman: that is, it is so large that we are mentally incapable of processing it without a whole lot of effort. And because of that, it's led to a lot of nastiness that's hurt a bunch of people, not even because the people inflicting the pain are evil, but because they can't comprehend the extent of their actions. And, of course, they have incentives to look only at the good their actions create, and not at all at the bad  much like you with your silly ""YOU USE COMPUTERS TOO"" argument.<p>Now, the reason I'm not a radical anarchist like some of my friends is that I feel people attempting to revise capitalism can still achieve something from within the system. I also think that capitalism is better enough than the old alternatives that its shittiness can be, not forgiven, but understood within the greater historical context. My radical friends would disagree with this: they'd argue that enough freedom was lost in the 20th century that we're worse off now than ever before. I suspect they're wrong. They'd also argue that capitalism cannot be fixed without outright revolution  I disagree with that too. But I think it's pretty obvious that ""capitalism unto itself"" is an outdated economic model with some blatant flaws, and that we'll see the world slowly adopting more humane systems. And again, this is not a controversial thought except among those who've rationalized the deaths and sufferings of all the people who go into making this comfortable system for we lucky few.<p>I'm conflicted about how stuck I am with the system that currently exists, about how little alternative I have. I hope that tech manufacturers figure out a way to offer me good products with much less human suffering behind their manufacturing; I'd pay a premium for that, in fact. And capitalism allows for that too, so I can criticize the state of our capitalist world today without rejecting capitalism outright and going to live in the woods. I like civilization. I just happen to think that capitalism is not quite so civilized as you'd like to believe it is for convenience's sake.",1359910462

5160145,comment,5159734,5160004,3,0,RichardPrice,,,"I believe that the two problems you mention, about peer review taking so long, and mathematicians not generally commenting much online, can be solved with reputation metrics.<p>The reason scientists don't blog a lot, or comment on blogs, is that there aren't reputation metrics associated with that kind of contribution to the scientific canon. It is the same reason that scientists don't share their data-sets. It is work to blog, and to prepare data-sets for public consumption, and there is no reward. If we reward scientists for sharing their comments on each other's papers, and for sharing data-sets, more scientists will be incentivized to make these kinds of contributions to the scientific canon.<p>The same goes for speed. When the journal editor asks a scientist to peer review a paper, the scientist accepts the request out of a sense of social obligation, but immediately that job goes to the bottom of her list of priorities. She will get no credit for doing the peer review, and so there is no reason to do it quickly.<p>This de-prioritization of peer review slows down the whole scientific communication system. To speed it up, we need to incentivize scientists to share their comments quickly. If someone sees something wrong the description of an experimental set-up, the system needs to be set up in such a way that they are incentivized to share that insight quickly.",1359910414

5160126,comment,5160082,5160082,34,0,tokenadult,,,"Surely this can't be legal under existing copyright law. From the article, ""The District holds common law copyright, at a minimum, to all relevant intellectual property its city and school employees create, a spokeswoman said."" I take it that the school district's lawyer was not consulted before that statement was made, or else the lawyer was a doofus about copyright law. There isn't any ""common law copyright,"" in the first place. (FIRST EDIT: a reply to this comment correctly points out that the story is primarily about a ""proposal by the Prince Georges County Board of Education"" and that the District of Columbia public schools are a distinct public school system. So I should make clear that I think that ANY school district that thinks it can assert a copyright interest in pupil or student assignments is mistaken about the law, and parents should challenge districts that make such statements.)<p>The work-for-hire exception to the general copyright law principle that the right of copyright belongs to the creator from fixation is narrowly construed, and school pupils attending a public school don't meet the rather narrow exceptions that trigger the work-for-hire doctrine.<p><a href=""http://www.theiplawblog.com/archives/-copyright-law-ownership-issues-underlying-the-work-made-for-hire-doctrine.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theiplawblog.com/archives/-copyright-law-ownershi...</a><p><a href=""http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ09.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ09.pdf</a><p>School pupils are not employees of school districts. Works produced in the scope of employment by school district employees may indeed be works for hire (there is some scope for interpretation in applying this part of the work-for-hire doctrine) but, again, students and pupils are not employees of the school district. They have authorship rights in their works from the moment of fixation. (That students and pupils are usually minors, not adults, is an additional complication in asserting that right, but that doesn't pass the right to the school.)<p>Anecdote: I made a school art project in second grade, a picture of a Mongol horseman, that somehow was precociously good, probably because I had seen other such drawings at home when reading history books. The school's specialist art teacher was so impressed by the picture that she took it, and I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT AGAIN. Every time I tell this story, I encounter other adults who also remember producing an art project in school that was taken by a teacher, never to be returned. Thanks a lot.<p>My advice to parents, which I advise parents to memorize, whenever I speak at a public meeting about educational law: if a school official tells you that you must put up with some school rule, because the rule is the law, say, ""What is your legal authority to ask me to do this?"" Statutes and case holdings and administrative regulations have citations. If it's really the law, someone can look it up and see exactly what the law says. Schools can only make up policies under authority granted to the schools by other law-making bodies. And if a school district has a policy, it still needs to be written down somewhere. In my experience, most school district officials who say ""It's the law"" are nonlawyers and are often mistaken about what the law says. If a school tells you that you can't do what's right by your child because ""it's the law,"" ask for the citation of the law. If it's really a law, there is a citation, and the law can be looked up. In the United States, under its Anglo-American system of law, the default assumption is individual liberty (and parents rather than schools acting in the interests of minor children), so make sure to check the specific law before believing your freedom is restricted by the law in the manner the school official claims.<p>SECOND EDIT: A different top-level comment in this thread mentions a policy of the University of California Berkeley. I have an inference about what that is about, and it would be enormously helpful to the discussion to link to the exact text of what students agree to as they enroll, which is surely a public document that very likely lives on the World Wide Web.",1359910060

Worth googling them and you will likely find lots of information. They are strong at execution putting alot of money and people on a project from day 1.<p>If you zoom in on a couple of cases such fab.com or airbnb.com, it is intesting to observe what happened. In Fab.com's case, Rocket internet were getting geared up to copy Fab as Fab was growing fast. Jason Goldberg wrote a letter to all the designers on fab.com and published a post on his own blog saying that it was pointless to copy them. Fab.com deals with designers, and designers hate when people copy them so it was very likely designers wouldn't want to have anything to do with a copy and the rocket clone failed. Airbnb bought smaller competitors, not the rocket clone managing to get around the clone that way.<p>Then there is the question, ""are clones useful?"" In some cases, very much so. If a startup wants to expand fast, one avenue it can take is to grow fast in a large city and then acquire the smaller clone startups elsewhere which have already tested how the idea needs to adapt to that context. This would be faster than organic growth.<p>Lastly, you realise everything is a remix. <a href=""http://www.everythingisaremix.info/everything-is-a-remix-the-ted-talk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.everythingisaremix.info/everything-is-a-remix-the...</a> Almost every idea is a copy of the last.

Paying $2k to get a paper published is not a high hurdle (especially once the norm of closed-access publishing fades away).  And this really seems like the minimum cost that needs to be incurred in order to get decent copyediting and the editorial cost of co-ordinating the referees.  I love the ArXiv, but if I can get a the copyedited version from the journal I will.<p>Yes the referees aren't paid, which may or may not change, but paying a PhD editor $500 to figure out the best referees and engage in the back-and-forth with them and the authors is pretty minimal.  So $2k for a professionally edited, polished paper which is then free to everyone forever seems like a pretty good deal, and essentially a non-issue.<p>Your point about the need for incentives for scientists to share non-paper scientific output like code is well-taken (and well-known).  But I don't see why this can't be solved by open-access journals. I am completely unconvinced that facebook likes controlled by a for-profit organization are the way to go.<p>EDIT: By the way, you've mentioned in several places the 12-month time lag for publishing.  This was solved for the physics community by the ArXiv; the papers get immediately released, <i>and</i> you can still submit to journals for the benefits of copyediting and refereeing.

Those who articulated this dissatisfaction were the early Romantics, and they ushered in a new artistic, literary, and intellectual movement. In the process they created several iconic anti-roles that we still recognize in popular culture.</i><p>Byronic hero: <i>the wanderer, the outcast, the Wandering Jew, the mysterious criminal whose crime is never explained.</i><p>The Visionary: <i>the first stage of recovery and the first positive Romantic anti-role. The word often used at the time was mystic. The Visionary tries to observe the world so intensely as to get to the essence outside of all mental categories. It was felt to be the special task and privilege of the artist and poet to communicate that experience.</i><p>The Bohemian: <i>perhaps the most modern of the anti-roles, characterized by a fascination with alcohol and drugs and sexual experimentation as ways to shift and change consciousness, put the mind through permutations of perceptions which are impossible for the square who is boxed in by his social role. Similar is the interest in non-bourgeouis modes of living, in indifference to middle-class standards of dress, furnishing, and cleanliness.</i><p>The Virtuoso: <i>The Visionary avoided role-playing; the Bohemian defied it; the Virtuoso and Dandy transcended it, the one by fantastic mastery, the other by irony. Paganini was the first great Virtuoso and for decades the anti-role model and ideal. Other examples are Richard Burton the Virtuoso traveler and translator of the Arabian Nights, and the Virtuoso mountain climber who performs sublime feats of superhuman effort because it was there.</i><p>The Dandy: <i>transforms the role not by excess but by irony. The role of the highest status in European society is that of the aristocratic gentleman of leisure. By willfully playing this role better than those born and trained to it, the Dandy reveals the pointlessness of the socially adapted. The social type with the highest status spends his life in play and pettiness. The Dandy instead offers perfection and elegance without content, without social function. By stealing the clothes of society, he reveals its nakedness. He demands a greater exquisiteness and perfection than society can achieve. This explains the irritation of society with the Dandy, its efforts to deprive him of his ironic authority, the moral nastiness with which England relished the downfall of Oscar Wilde.</i><p>Do any of these <i>not</i> evoke the hacker?",1359909115

I've just made the switch to 100% vim a week ago, so far everything feels way better, and coding is so much more fun, but I guess I need more time to really assess it.<p>For plugins, I think it is simply a case for familiarity.

For example, a Drupal developer may be graphic's designer.<p>Drupal allows end users to define ad-hock data types. That's what ""Drupal's Link Field Module"" is (a part of). Ad-hock data types are an option, not a requirement.<p>If an end user wants to define an ad-hock data type with a ""link"", they install and configure ""field modules"". That's a limitation of being an ""end user"" (as opposed to being an application programmer).<p>A application programmer would look at Drupal's source code and see there is succinct API method to create a link.<p>So the broader issue is, you have folks with little to no programming experience making application programming decisions :) It's just as likely, the poster's project did not require ad-hock data types. Without any type of requirements analysis, the project fails.<p>Drupal's popularity (at least among CMS's) is due to it's set of logical features. It's not the technical implementation of the features :)<p>The downfall of most Drupal projects is due to poor resource choices.

Most importantly, if one reads only one book on any given subject, then one will only hear of one point of view. A problem that is made worse by selecting classics, which are usually written to make a point instead of summarizing the broader debate. The most obvious example from this list is probably <i>Origin of Species,</i> a work where Darwin did not talk about the evolution of man, because he did not wanted to be drawn into a theological debate.<p>Additionally the classics carry context, which may or may not be obvious. Here the most obvious example from the list is Adam Smith, who did not write about abstract global markets, as the term is used today, but he did write about a collection of market stalls. Similarly, his thought about government and regulation was informed by his times, the first edition appeared in 1776, the same year as the declaration of independence and thirteen years before the French revolution. So Adam Smith did never write about a modern nation, with formal representation and a process for the transition of power, but he did write about a late feudal society, in which the political power was held by an unchecked former warrior elite.<p>[ The above does not mean that I am against reading classics, in fact quite the opposite.

They have the choice between smart people who can look up things on the Internet but aren't interested enough to memorize the basics, and smart people who are interested enough in the subject matter to have the basics memorized (or at least are smart enough to put on a good show of loving the subject matter).<p>Maybe having the basics memorized isn't necessary for the job, but it's a good signal that you're not a zombie banging out code without really being interested or thinking critically about what you're doing.  It's not a perfect signal, but it's still a useful signal.<p>Everyone knows you need to know your basic data structures for a Google interview.  If you don't know your data structures, cram for a week or two before your interview.  The basic data structures are just the basic starting point for the data structures interview questions.  The interviewer needs to know you know the basic data structures before they start throwing curveballs at you to see how you think about and solve hard data structures problems.  The people who think they're too smart or too cool for the basic data structures questions are just going to drown, so if they bomb the basic data structures questions, the interviewer justs moves on and pretends that was where the question ended.  There's no sense in frustrating the interviewee and making the whole company look mean and forcing the interviewee to answer questions they lack the background knowledge to begin solving.<p>On top of that, if you can't even be bothered to cram some basic data structures for an interview, you're not going to fit in well at Google.<p>I also asked some constrained bin packing questions, related to scheduling distributed computations in a cluster and placing files in a distributed filesystem, but I'd simplify the problem a bit and make up some slightly silly story about kids selling candy or something.  The simplification and the non-computer back story helps reduce the amount of assumed specialized knowledge, and keeps people from over-thinking the thing, thinking it's a trick question, or otherwise running off into the weeds.<p>Silly stories really do help people accept the simplified problem and not get lost thinking they're supposed to be thinking outside the box.  If you ask a question about networking, people will suggest reducing the number of intermediate switches or maybe even swapping the network media with something with a higher signal propagation velocity.  Rephrase it as kids playing Pokemon with cards, and they're moere likely to notice that O(N^2) network traffic can be reduced to O(Log(N)).<p>Some people just thought some problem involving candy or trading cards instead of computers was beneath them and silly, obviously missing that the underlying problem had real implications for computing at massive scales.  If they got upset about the problem, I just let it go, since arguing with them or making them feel dumb by pointing out the isomorphism would just rile them up for their next interviewer.  I usually genuinely hoped they'd do better with the next interviewer.  Good engineers are hard to find, and if I'm the only person they rubbed the wrong way, they're unlikely to be working with me anyway.<p>If you notice how the simplified silly problem is probably related to a real problem the interviewer has had to solve, it's probably best to make a nonchalant comment.

That economist (definitely not mainstream) did write, in 1999, that the introduction of the common currency in Europe (the Euro) would lead to: ""Too many houses in Spain, too many industries in Germany and too many public servants in France.  That Spain was going to state default, followed by Greece"".<p>So he got the order wrong about Greece (which already default a first time and which is going to default again) and Spain, but besides that he was  spot on.<p>And you cannot say: ""If you take enough economists, one of them is going to predict the future"".  Because here the prediction was way too precise to be sheer luck.  He did explain the precise mechanisms that would lead to that situation (and he did bet his money accordingly and made millions).<p>Basically after reading that you understand how wrong the Keynes school is and how Krugman totally lost it (yeah, let's mill a $1 trillion coin... Why not mill 26 of them and be done with the public debt right!?).<p>There are going to be more state defaults in Europe (it's not even opened up for debate), starting with Greece which is going to default again.  There's going to either severe inflation or partial state default in the U.S. too unless public spendings are dramatically brought down.  No way out.<p>I'd suggest not to read from people explaining the past or the present.  It's not interesting.  It's more interesting to take out older writings explaining what's going to happen in the future and why.  People able to do that are the most critical thinkers ever.<p>These writers often use an aggressive tone but you have to bear with it: these people are right and they know it and hardly anyone is listening to them.",1359907779

It is easy and common for mathematicians to share their work (e.g. on the arXiv) and I consider myself fortunate to get two or three good comments, let alone hundreds. (Of course, this is a claim made by TC, not by academia.edu.) Whatever the virtues of academia.edu or any other technological solution, I do not expect it to multiply the audience for my work by an order of magnitude.<p>By way of comparison, check out Terry Tao's math blog. His reputation, his expositional ability, and the size and enthusiasm of his audience are surpassed by no one. And of course, the blog (and the ability to comment) are freely available to everyone with a web browser.<p><a href=""http://terrytao.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://terrytao.wordpress.com/</a><p>Look at the comment counts. For many posts, in the single digits. And this low, even though Tao personally responds to many of the comments and questions.<p>I suggest that this is likely to be an upper bound for responses to math writing posted anywhere, in any format, with or without restrictions on how can read, write, or respond to what's posted.<p>I don't think peer review is broken, at least not in math. It can be annoying to do (which is why it takes so long), but we regard it as an obligation and that's why we do it.<p>The issue, in my mind, is to separate peer review from ""publishing"", or more to the point, from dissemination. The reason this problem is so thorny and obnoxious (again, in my mind) is that in principle it is trivial.",1359907483

Aside from the aforementioned Obj-C dabbling, I use vim for almost everything. There are so many awesome plugins that do just about everything I could ask for and therefore I have yet to do any plugin writing myself. Having seen the usual complaints around VimL, what's the deal with external scripting support? I compiled with +python and +ruby since that's what I'm familiar with for plugins, scripts, etc. and a few plugins I have did require one or the other <i>but</i> are there any downsides?

2117346,comment,2113066,2113066,0,0,karlclement,,,"Hello there,<p>Overall application idea is great and very useful for any service based company. Although there are many things that would need to change or be added to make it that much more appealing.<p>-First of all, the websites design needs some work. I find it to be plain, unappealing and untrustworthy. With a brighter design, you can attract a lot more users. Maybe try choosing some main accent colors and applying them throughout the application.<p>-From a Developers point of view, the application runs very smoothly. Solid programming but missing a lot of features.<p>-I would concentrate on adding Google Cal syncing capabilities. I understand that it has already been mentioned but its too important to pass on. Many service companies use Google Apps to organize their scheduling. This would make things a lot easier for any user. Maybe even integrate with other project management applications such as Basecamp or any other.<p>-For the booking process, I think you should also ask the most information possible from the client. This will make things easier for the company to contact the user.<p>-The domain name is simple and easy to remember, but I would try to find a shorter abbreviated version to host the users apps.<p>-You could also allow the registered users to insert their custom logo for a small one time fee.<p>-For future consideration, maybe even add an advanced payment ability. Allowing the clients to pay by credit card in advanced and send the payment directly to the company (Paypal, Authorize.net etc.) You can also charge a small percentage of the transaction as commission.<p>Overall great idea. Keep up the good work! Good luck!",1295384122

To keep Ellie in control long enough to read more than a sentance was a complicated maneuver, but the best way (this was relayed by the teacher-coordinator person) involved being really close with him and loosely holding him in place. I don't know much about Ellie's potential conditions or history, but this makes some sort of sense. Suffice it to say, they were close, but in a totally appropriate manner (I was in a position to guage, because I was basically staring in awe the entire time)<p>But a few minutes in, Ellie decides he's done reading for the day. And for one reason or another, he jumps up out of the bench seat, pointing an accusatory finger at his tutor. His English wasn't super clear, and he wasn't being very loud (thank god), but I did catch ""touch"" and ""special area.""<p>The two of us are frozen in horror. What can you say but ""I... b... no...""? Ellie maintains this outrage long enough to really get some good satisfaction out of the looks on our faces, and then he relents and just starts laughing at us.<p>What if someone walking by had heard?

We tried to impress upon him never to do something like that again, but he clearly didn't grasp the full potential force of his actions. We were like 20 at the time, and ill-equipped to deal with children on this level, so we probably should have relayed the event to an adult of some sort, but we were too worried about how it would be perceived, so we just moved on.<p>Neither of us stopped volunteering because of the incident, but I'll never forget the sinking dread of that instant, that's for sure.<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/e7l16/i_work_with_atrisk_children_26_and_have_a_hard/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/e7l16/i_work_with...</a>",1295382680

It varies depending on the implementation, it's sort of a la carte, and the PSN itself delivers some features by default. But you wont be paying for DLC on Valve games, ever. That is not a thing that will happen. And since Microsoft won't allow you to charge for something that is free on another system (recall R6: Vegas, or Burnout Paradise) it's an end run that's given Valve a lot of leverage. To sum up, Portal 2 isn't the surprise - Steamworks is the surprise. The porous nature of the PSN's functionality is an amazing opportunity for a company whose platform practically defines ""platforms."" Plus, there's no license associated with its use. Think about what this means for other developers, up to and including first parties. Why Sony would cede this kind of power to a third party I couldn't say, and why they would undermine the Playstation Store as a venue for premium content I couldn't tell you.

Only once did I get asked ""is there going to be a mom here with you?"" but I know it was in a lot of their minds. But I never had one refuse to leave their kid with us. Over the years I've had plenty of moms eventually tell me how glad they were to see men working with kids.<p>I did get a chance for 2 years to run more ""boy-friendly"" activities at church. We did mock camp-outs, blanket forts, went outside for classes whenever the weather and sunlight allowed, and even had campfires outside during what otherwise would have been time spent sitting around a table trying to pay attention. Boys don't work well indoors trying to sit still and pay attention. They really do absorb more if they're outside and their hands are busy.<p>I even got to work with a special-needs girl that was horribly abused by her birth parents.

Once again we'd need a common declarative format as a base, and software tailored for the different nodes.",1295381460

In any case, Facebook and to a large degree GMail are just not relevant for me.  If they weren't there, or I felt compelled to abandon them for some reason, I wouldn't have a problem finding another way to contact them.<p>So let's recognize that Facebook, Google and even Microsoft are young in comparisons to the average human's life-span.  And when the next big thing comes along, we'll embrace it until temporarily too.<p>One big caveat ... these companies build up customer good-will over longer or shorter periods of time and can persist until that reservoir is run dry.  With a little care, that good-will can last a long time, so I'm not saying that Microsoft is in any danger as a company.  But I do think they're past their heyday and will have to reduce their margins to keep business.<p>Anyway, we're so conditioned to sign-up for a service at the drop of a hat that these services become ""cheap"" to us.  They didn't cost us anything and they don't cost much to throw away.  Look at the number of people who signed up for Hipster without knowing what it is.

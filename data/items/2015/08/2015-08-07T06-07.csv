  exactly the point when they made the decision to
  move.
</code></pre>
Then, it goes on to say:<p><pre><code>  There’s no reason to think that we are reliable
  reporters of every aspect of our minds.
</code></pre>
Well, this is quite the conundrum.  Which is it?  Report <i>exactly</i> when you do something or accept that we are not &quot;reliable reporters?&quot;  Yet the author goes on to further say:<p><pre><code>  Even supporters of Libet have to admit that
  the situation used in the experiment may be too
  artificial to be a direct model of real everyday
  choices.
</code></pre>
Given the delays in perception we all experience due to working at &quot;chemical speed&quot;, as opposed to light speed, this experiment smacks of fast-twitch muscle measurement more so than exercising free will.<p>Even the original premise of Libet&#x27;s experiment negates a free will choice:<p><pre><code>  “let the urge [to move] appear on its own at any time without any pre-planning or concentration on when to act”
</code></pre>
How is this free will?  Free will is a conscious <i>choice</i> to do something, not a subconscious act.",1438930785

And like any other none practical rule, this one will not only survive but also result in a higher negative(for the gov&#x27;t)numbers. Just like we saw during the Prohibition period, this will also make people to see the law as whimsical and unimportant, instead of something good and protecting. It did nothing to encourage the respect and obedience the law deserves. I agree there is a lot of harm that&#x27;s caused by porn, both personally and sociologically. Personal one is our own free will, governments cannot ban everything that is harmful to us but in this case I can understand and support governments who will fight against sociologically disruptive porns with the content of rape, beastiality, extreme fetishism and definitely child porn.",1438930629

Steve Mann was &quot;accused&quot; of shoplifting by an exit alarm, at a department store, and began recording a video to create evidence to help exonerate himself.  Then he was detained specifically for recording a video in the store.<p>Now legally, a shopkeeper can only ask someone to stop recording, and ask them to leave the premises -- if the person doesn&#x27;t comply, then they can be charged with trespassing.  But the shopkeeper has no legal right to destroy a video recording or equipment.  So, the only legal rationale preventing people from recording in privately-owned public spaces is the risk of being charged with trespassing. And, it doesn&#x27;t make sense that someone can be charged with trespassing while being detained.  Therefore, while being detained on private property, a person has the legal right to create video recordings.<p>This is something Steve Mann (who, as a cyborg, is often wearing/being a camera) would like to establish as case law, and is looking for help to do so.

If you don&#x27;t agree with this then you&#x27;re going to have to tell me what your definition of &quot;effect system&quot; and &quot;type system&quot; are.<p>Haskell&#x27;s type system, as you rightly note, <i>models</i> effects through types on return values combined with monads. But Haskell code -- since the language is pure -- by definition has no effects. It triggers effects in the runtime by returning monadic values, but it doesn&#x27;t actually have effects (if it did, it wouldn&#x27;t have been pure). An effect system[1] describes the effect <i>impure</i> functions have rather than the types of the values they return (i.e. they don&#x27;t require effects to be modeled as values). An example of an effect system is Java&#x27;s checked exceptions, or Koka&#x27;s effects.<p>> Wow, that was good timing!<p>You&#x27;ll be disappointed if you&#x27;re expecting a discussion of effect systems...<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_system"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_system</a>",1438930471

Secondly, the big discussion of abusing its market dominance was ultimately triggered by Yelp and other vertical search engines. Google first ripped of Yelp by scraping their content and then added it to their own Google Places search. After that, they decided to give their own service more relevancy. This would not be a problem, IF they were competition in the European market, but Google has an average market share of 90 percent in Europe (note, that it has up to 99 percent in other markets like Germany) and thus Yelp is super dependent on Google. 
Overall, this is NOT a fair market and Google has such a dominance in that market that new players are not likely (or ever) to appear. A 99 percent market share is a monopoly, there are not many non-government markets that experience such a malfunction.",1438930312

Finding the most relevant X on the web is fundamentally part of the same market no matter what X is.<p>Now, if they&#x27;d accused Google of using their market position in search to promote gmail, for instance, they might have a point.  Not a very good point, but at least an understandable point.  But calling &quot;general search&quot; and &quot;product search&quot; two different markets?  They seem to just be looking for a way to extort concessions out of a company that seems like a tempting target, all the more so for not being an EU company.<p>Later in the same article is an indignant accusation that Google&#x27;s display of other types of search results don&#x27;t label themselves as ads.  Of course they&#x27;re not; if you search for an address, and you conveniently get a map of that address (which is one of the most likely things you were looking for), that&#x27;s not an ad, that&#x27;s the content you actually wanted.  (By contrast, the garbage next to it telling you about other services related to random keywords in the search terms <i>are</i> ads.)<p>Now, the crazy 2014 deal that fell through certainly does sound like antitrust-style collusion; it&#x27;s certainly ridiculous to have competitors bid for the right to appear as a list of competing services at the top of Google search results.  But far from the &quot;extortion&quot; it&#x27;s described as, it sounds a lot more like collusion between multiple large companies to exclude smaller players.  The solution isn&#x27;t to find a way to include more companies; it&#x27;s to forget that that anticompetitive arrangement was ever proposed, and continue on with the current situation where Google shows users whatever it thinks they&#x27;re looking for.<p>(I&#x27;m not suggesting that Google has pure and altruistic motives here; far from it.

It&#x27;s &quot;funny&quot; how common 1000+ character uncommented oneliner regular expressions are, while in any other programming language even things like `if (flag) return;` would get rejected for being dangerous, unreadable, uncommented, brace style violations and possibly even for being too long if indentation and length of the flag name make this exceed just 80 characters.<p>Is this because people think of a regex as an atomic blackbox instead of a program or function that can be read and modified? For example when a regex is incorrect, they don&#x27;t say &quot;This regex is incorrect. How can it be corrected?&quot; like they would for a program or function, but &quot;This is the incorrect regex. Which one is the correct regex.&quot;<p>Free-spacing mode (where you can add whitespace, newlines and comments to a regex) would at least help a little. (Although even then I think a function with early returns is often more appropriate. Possibly using very small regular expressions for some of the individual checks.)
But I rarely even see free-spacing modes mentioned. Maybe because most programmers using regex actually prefer an atomic blackbox?",1438927974

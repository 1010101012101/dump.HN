Previous lab meat experiments used fetal calf serum.<p>Engineering meat directly on a large scale is probably going to happen before a significant percentage of people ethically convert to animal-free lifestyles.  It would make a huge difference in human-perpetrated cruelty, as the U.S. currently slaughters 10 billion land animals and around 15 billion aquatic animals (not counting by-catch) every year.<p>However, general consensus among farm animal rescues/sanctuaries is that egg and milk operations are the cruellest, moreso than beef.  Thus, contrary to popular belief, eating steak while avoiding milk and eggs puts more of a dent into animal cruelty than becoming an ovo-lacto vegetarian.<p>Another common misconception is that fish is healthy; due to environmental pollution, however, fish now frequently contains unsafe levels of mercury and other heavy metals; plus DDT, dioxin, PCBs, etc.  This is due to concentration as you go up the food chain, where the fish that humans eat have several orders of magnitude more contaminants than the water they swim in.<p>DHA and EPA, the Omega-3 fatty acids that are present in certain types of fish oil, are also now available in oil from marine algae.  E.g. <a href=""http://www.water4.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.water4.net/</a>  (this brand has no discernible taste, unlike some others).  Brain food is probably a good idea for hackers.",1208033511

Not a shortcut per-se, but handy nonetheless - Go to any search engine (Google, Amazon), right click on the search text field and select ""Add a keyword for this Search"". A dialog pops up, anything works for the name, say Google. For the keyword put say ""g"". Store it somewhere, I put mine in a folder called Shortcuts, but anything works. Now, the next time you want to do a Google search, hit Ctrl-l (thats ""l"" as in ""length"", and Ctrl-l puts your cursor in the address bar). Type g followed by what you are searching for. Firefox submits your search to Google!<p>3. Just start typing on a webpage for Quick search. I dont know of moving forward or backwork with this, but its useful to find the first occurrence of a word. If the highlighted word happens to be a link is a link, hitting enter activates the link. This is handy for ""Login"" links.",1208032412

162042,comment,161886,161970,0,0,apexauk,,,"""that's an easy comment to make that very much fits the zeitgeist"" .. ""'build it and the money will come' strategies fail""<p>Hold on - the point I'm making was not the cliche ""build it and they [customers, users, investors] will come. The point is that in the <i>very specific micro-seed stage</i> of companies, which is what YC/Seedcamp are dealing with, the first thing you need to spend time on is the product/core business idea. If you work on this, you'll have something tangible at the end of the 3 months, that you can then show people to get to the next stage.<p>If you don't build something (doesn't have to be a launched, fully funcitoning, customer-ready product) then how can you expect to achieve anything more than more seed funding, this time having demonstrated that you may not deliver in time?<p>""The YC-like approach could be caricatured as 'shotgun'""<p>Curious metaphor, but yes, this is the point. Find out as soon as possible what's going to work, and avoid wasting time on stuff that doesn't. If what a team does first doesn't work, they've learnt a whole lot about what to do same/differently with the next idea.<p>""but copycats don't deliver these [value added factors]""<p>Yup - correct. This is the big problem. But notice that the things that e.g. Seedcamp lacks are things that have been earned by YC over time, mostly down to previous success. You can't solve these problems by organising more theoretical lectures for the teams.<p>""The key is to make sure both launch-drive and business training/mentorship are provided in equal amounts""<p>No. This is the whole point. Having received <i>micro-seed-funding</i>, you need to get somewhere, fast.<p>Seed funding like YC/Seedcamp is about raising enough money to get to a stage where you can raise a proper angel round/series A. Spending 50% of your time ""learning business"" will definately benefit you as you go though life, but won't give you any deliverables to make your company succeed in the short term.<p>Either decide you want to learn business, and then study that <i>before</i> starting a company and getting funding, or concentrate on building your product and then learn about business by doing it for real once you have a real-life case study to work with.",1208032263

There are probably people going out somewhere tonight, but haven't decided yet and aren't using facebook to figure things out because text messages are way more reliable when everyone is scattered around actually doing things.",1208032071

That is when window tabbing becomes really outstanding, since you can tab together the two spreadsheets.<p>The advantage over just bringing forward the work sheet you want each time is that as you move one around and resize it (to cater for fitting the source data on the screen), the one you aren't currently working on changes with it saving you some clicks.

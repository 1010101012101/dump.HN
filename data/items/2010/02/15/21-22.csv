In the IE 5 box model, the size of boxes includes their borders and padding, while in the W3C box model, the size of boxes includes only the content of the boxes (the IE 5 version actually makes more sense, but it's not what's in the standard). In later versions of IE, the standard box model is used, but only if you're in standards mode; the IE 5 model is used in quirks mode. Nowadays, almost all browsers support a CSS3 property, box-sizing that can control which box model to use, so you can actually enable the traditional box model in a standard way (though it's prefixed -moz-box-sizing or -webkit-box-sizing in Gecko and Webkit, as that's the preferred way to implement standards that aren't yet finalized)<p>For more detail on the differences between quirks and standards mode, see:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode</a><p>and<p><a href=""http://www.quirksmode.org/css/quirksmode.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quirksmode.org/css/quirksmode.html</a>",1266270954

(think of it, the users data is probably the most valuable data an internet company has today). It looks to me, as if a team had a good idea (yes, i think buzz as an idea is a good idea, the launch was not) but it was not properly tested and thought of such cases. All in all it was released far too early for far too many people. I still wonder why they didn't roll out buzz on an invite only base like they did with gmail. All this negative press could've been avoided and most people would be like ""yay, thats cool!"" without the ""oh shit""-effect.<p>But that attitude that google fucked up your privacy on intent is just stupid. I agree, Googles power is scary: Think of it, google may control a lot of users internet experience from end-to-end in the future (ISP->Search->Mail->Mobile->Android->Netbooks+advertising = omg, scary!).

There's a strong community of developers accessing these tools for free, which would allow Microsoft to roll out a full and lively app store quickly. I would be highly optimistic about Microsoft's ability to run an app store service, based on experiences with Xbox Live, Xbox Indie Games, and Rock Band Network. Since they're building from scratch, they could analyze and avoid legacy issues present in Apple's iTunes App Store ecology.<p>Converse to their potential strengths at running an app store, Microsoft has a difficult decision posed by marketing. There are a lot of people out there addicted to Xbox Live Achievement points. If MS allows you to earn achievement points via games on it's new mobile phone, it will get a <i>tremendous</i> boost in market share.<p>The risk present here is that the achievement points system requires additional overhead and review by MS, in order to prevent system breaking games. There's no feasible way for them to populate their app store with indies <i>and</i> approve achievement points for all of them.<p>In order to have their cake and eat it to, MS needs to be able to differentiate achievement point games from indie games, but without turning indie games into an unshopped ghetto (see Xbox Indie Games). My best resolution would be to offer a small differentiation to icons on the store, specifically take those icons for games with points and apply a smaller logo to the corner, much like on a shortcut icon.

But when it comes time to ask a question, I go to SO immediately and almost always get a reasonable answer within a few hours. The more this keeps happening, the more the Googling step will become irrelevant.",1266268032

YMMV but I find it better to apply these to the situation rather than as a ""by the book"" technique of filtering out job opportunities. There are tons of great small startups that have yet to hit their stride yet. You could be the one to show them the folly of their ways and help them hit that stride.",1266267970

The idea that higher education should be organised with all the best professors &c. in one place, and students come from all around to a centralised place of learning, isn't crazy at all. And, as gfodor pointed out, those 4 years are character-building.<p>I think the article raises some issues but in far too aggressive a way. There <i>are</i> problems with the way students are forced to pick a career path so early, but the assertion that ""any system that asks you to devalue a relationship with place or with extended family is evil"" doesn't stand up to much scrutiny. He doesn't consider any of the benefits of spending time away from home, and doesn't really back up his claim with anything at all.",1266267905

I'm sort of picturing Apple killing off the 17 inch Pro, 13 inch Pro, Mac Pro, and then slimming down the iMac and 15 inch Pro by removing the optical drive. They are done with optical media. It wouldn't shock me at all to see DVD Player removed from 10.8.<p>> Interfacing with Apple Remotes<p>Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure this ability was removed with 10.6.

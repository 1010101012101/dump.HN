Compared to using strings (or other representations), they allow you to do math 100-1000 times faster (probably even more). When you actually start programming, you start getting used to these limits, and realise that for 90% of programs they don't matter. If your program ever did reach those limits, there are libraries you can switch to to get around it, which use alternate representations.

SML/NJ was a research platform first and high-performance/implementation second.<p>Defunctorization helps, but from talking with Matthew Fluet, most of the perf comes from the combination of monomorphization and whole-program compilation. You get to avoid all the hackery involved with trying to mix essential inlining (e.g., map, foldl) with separate compilation and the somewhat unpredictable performance that results when a user accidentally writes their own map function but puts it in a separate source file without magical incantations for the inliner.<p>Also, we're working to get the rights for the definition back from MIT press so we can both push out a free PDF version and update the bugs. There are several corner cases that Harper, Tofte, and MacQueen consider mistakes in the '97 version of the definition, but haven't really taken the time to push out an updated definition, after the ML2000 effort went nowhere.

5648192,comment,5646919,5647763,3,0,haberman,,,"Thanks!  Yes I am also impressed by how relatively easy this is to implement at the machine level.  One thing I meant to do for that article but didn't get to is implement each of those algorithms in assembly directly and see if the C/C++ solution would compile into the optimal machine code (or something equally efficient).<p>In assembly you have the luxury of no undefined or implementation-defined behavior.  This makes things a lot easier, since you can count on things like two's complement.  In assembly these checks are probably as easy as (untested):<p><pre><code>    will_u64_overflow_u32:\n      ; If any of the high 32 bits are set.\n      shr   rdi, 32\n      setne al\n      ret\n\n    will_u64_overflow_i32:\n      ; If any of the high 33 bits are set.\n      shr   rdi, 33\n      setne al\n      ret\n\n    will_i64_overflow_i32\n      ; If the high 32 bits are other than all 0 or all 1.\n      shr   rdi, 32\n      add   edi, 1\n      cmp   edi, 1\n      seta  al\n      ret\n</code></pre>\nI'm not sure if these are exactly right, but I think the right answers are about this simple.  Any of these could also be written simply in C/C++ also, the main difference is just that in assembly you can make machine-specific assumptions (like two's complement) since you're already doing something machine-specific.",1367541523

Houston (where I spent a portion of my childhood) is a large city with no zoning laws, and yet is exceptionally sprawling.<p>Suburbanism in Houston ends up being propelled through a mixture of:<p>1. Land availability, transit, and culture. There is a ton of space, it's flat w/ no natural geographical constraints, people like to live in big houses in the suburbs, there are freeways, and there is barely any public transit to speak of. So people live in the suburbs.<p>2. Contract law. There are large, privately developed suburbs where the developers require purchasers to agree to contracts governing their future use of the property, as a condition of sale. Suburbanites don't want a metalworking factory next door, so if you're developing a suburb, you get better sale prices if you can assure purchasers that that won't happen. So you do so by adding contract conditions. In a typical Houston suburb, your deed will have conditions attached, in which you have signed an agreement that neither you, nor anyone you convey the property to, will: subdivide the property, redevelop it into anything higher than 2 stories, redevelop it into a house that takes up more than x% of the lot, operate a commercial or industrial establishment on it, or lease it to tenants. This <i>de facto</i> introduces something like zoning via private contract law. So if you really don't want zoning, you'd have to actively suppress private-sector zoning, not only repeal governmental zoning.",1367541162

Compared to the level of innovation in colo/dedicated hosting (~zero per year) and openstack, AWS is amazing.<p>It's still inferior to a good on-premises or colocated environment (mainly due to technical limitations in the virtualized environment; AWS's policy is top-notch commercial standard), but that may not matter for you.  AWS pricing and performance is also worse in a lot of ways than dedicated hardware, but may also not matter to you.<p>A lot of the big cloud/dedicated hosting companies have decent security (SoftLayer, Rackspace), but aren't as good at AWS at policy or technical security.  The sketchy VPS providers are miles below the middling standard set by companies like Rackspace.<p>Linode is solidly in the ""sketchy VPS provider"" realm.  A bit better for availability, and not likely to actually be attacking you themselves, but not a responsible choice for anyone who cares about security from everything I've seen.<p>PaaS, in practice, is also a good solution if you care about security but have no skills or budget.

5648077,comment,5645787,5647447,4,0,ww520,,,"Good question.  In general the non-preemptive green-thread/fiber/lightweight-thread is a pretty well understood notion.  Some OS support it, e.g. Windows supports manually scheduled fiber.  However, OS support is not universal.  It will take time, just like the transition from process to thread.  Most supports come in the form of user-mode library since it doesn't need kernel-mode support.<p>Native thread needs stack which can be substantial, usually ~1M.  Lightweight thread just needs a data structure to hold its data, usually hundreds of bytes to a few K.  It's a factor of 1000X to 10000X.<p>Besides the memory advantage, lightweight threads can have performance advantage over native threads since the switching of lightweight threads on the same CPU doesn't need to do a context-switch, which can have substantial performance penalty as the L1/L2 cache and all the registers of the CPU need to be flushed and reloaded.  On a multi-cpu system, memory barriers need to be crossed, cache needed to be sync'ed across CPU, and the TLB might be flushed as well, depending on how the OS implements the memory model of a thread.<p>Lightweight thread does require more attention from app developers since they need to worry about manually yielding now.<p>Java has great support on NIO which when used with lightweight threads can provide amazing scalability and performance boosts.

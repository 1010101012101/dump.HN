Nothing prevents service instance clustering and co-location on the same hardware machine in different runtime units like containers or vm&#x27;s talking to a db running on a single machine. It&#x27;s a function of the scale and maturity of the system. Consistency itself is a function of state management within a system and more importantly, a non-trivial system typically has quite a few data stores and access patterns with their respective consistency requirements.

Price paid is that you sacrifice instruction space, for example because the instruction format allows you to write the result of an operation to a register hard-wired to contain a zero.<p>And x86 isn&#x27;t that CISC-y.

9815416,comment,9810342,9811835,0,0,sedachv,,,"> However, many languages take an alternate approach and codify the most common programming patterns into their specification. The result is a compromise that works for the majority of cases, and better understood than custom macros.<p>That&#x27;s not the case in my experience. It&#x27;s very easy to look up the definition of a macro, or see what the macro-expansion of an expression looks like. Good luck trying to figure out what your interpreter/compiler/JIT is actually doing when the language documentation is lacking.<p>For Common Lisp at least the quality of documentation is also another huge advantage over any other language I&#x27;ve used - the Hyperspec (<a href=""http://clhs.lisp.se/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clhs.lisp.se/</a>) is extremely detailed, concise, and easy to access (you can pull up the documentation page for a particular symbol with a keystroke, or browse through the index or by TOC when you aren&#x27;t sure what you are looking for).<p>> Homoiconicity is elegant, but somewhat over rated in practice. Declaratively expressing intent does not require homoiconicity, you can do that in JSON or XML if you agree on a format. Now with lisp, code being data, you can be infinitely more expressive; but at the same time inferring intent out of complex code-as-data is essentially writing a very intelligent macro/parser. There&#x27;s a cost to it.<p>Except that doing it with JSON or XML is usually two orders of magnitude more code than a macro solution would be. Now simple problems that could have been debugged with a macroexpand involve tens of thousands of lines of parser libraries (it&#x27;s 2015, why are encoding errors still an issue for anyone?), ConfigurationFactories and class hierarchies for the internal representation of whatever it is you are trying to encode in JSON, and glue code to connect it to your current controller and model classes.<p>> Compilers can optimize well known constructs better than equivalent macros in lisp.<p>Compilers are very limited in the partial evaluation and domain-specific optimizations that they can do. This is not the case for macros.<p>> But there isn&#x27;t a one programming paradigm that&#x27;s universally better than others.<p>That&#x27;s kind of the point of macros - to allow you to add new programming paradigms without having to change the base language or compiler.",1435787118

9815346,comment,9813544,9814225,0,0,marincounty,,,"In college, I didn&#x27;t tell anyone I had an Atari St someting?
I wrote all my papers/homework on it, but felt like 
I was cheating?<p>All the other students were typing away, or paying a service to type their papers.  This was the 80&#x27;s.  I tried to get my girlfriend into it at the time, but she wanted no part of it.<p>I think my presentation of the computer was the problem?  I saw that she didn&#x27;t see the value in word processing, so 
I drew a slightly erotic cartoon with paint/illustrator?  She looked down at me and said, &quot;If you want the real thing, put that computer away?&quot;  I put my homemade cover on it, and had a great night!  I remember her telling me in bed, &quot;I don&#x27;t think computers will ever take off?&quot;  I actually agreed with her. I never thought they would be so commonplace.   I was still trying to impress her, so I didn&#x27;t tell her everything I wrote since high school was on this Atari.  Anyways, she was a great girlfriend, and I miss her.  She is now head of technology at some company.  Ingrid, you were the best!  I wish I was a better boyfriend.  I never experienced the relationship I had with you--with anyone else.  I tried, but never found that chemistry.<p>Anyway, I once had a English teacher accuse me of plagiarism.
I wrote a research paper on The Amygdala; the efficy of Psychosurgery on Violent Individuals.  He said he needed to ask his wife what an Amygdala was, and &#x27;She&#x27;s  a Psychologist?&#x27;.  &#x27;And the type on this paper looks weird?&#x27;  He kept tuning over the pages and looking for typewritten impressions?  I was beyond an introvert, and had no self-esteem at the time.  I remember just listening to him, and my only response was, I wrote this. My references are in the library?  I walked out of his office, and felt; I don&#x27;t trust this older generation of people?  To appease this English teacher, I dumbed down all my papers.  The irony was I am, and was a horrid writer.  The only words of wisdom in that little English department I overheard while sweltering in Mr. Taylor&#x27;s class was in Mr. Robinson&#x27;s class.  His class was next door. He told his class to never use clichés in your writing!  He then quipped &quot;even in verbal conversation?&quot;.  I always thought that was great advise.  He also stressed funneling  thoughts, and paragraphs.<p>I sometimes wonder why I wrote that Engish paper on that subject.  I remember, at the time, I had some weird thoughts, and thought someting was wrong with my brain?  I look back and had so much acne--everywhere?  I noticed, as my acne cleared up, so did my weird thoughts.(I bring this up because no one told us what to expect in the latter stages of puberty.  I honestly fell the natural testosterone made me feel like I was going crazy?  As I got older, the violent thoughts went away.  I always wondered if it was just hormones that make me feel like such a wako in college?<p>Anyway, my Atari St was a dirty secret back in the 80&#x27;s, but I loved it.  I don&#x27;t recall that dot matrix ribbon ever needing replacing?  Could any of you imagine--never buying any extra ink cartridges in four years of college?<p>I don&#x27;t miss college, and really didn&#x27;t learn much.  I miss Ingrid, and my classmates though.   I do miss the simplicity of computing back then.  I don&#x27;t miss needing to go to the library though.  I do miss seeing people out in public with nothing in their hands.  I miss that most?  No--still miss the college girlfriend; the grass was not greener in my little life.  Sorry, about rambling on!",1435786521

9815254,comment,9814131,9814131,0,0,redsymbol,,,"Am I the only one who thinks containers and config management tools - e.g., chef, puppet, ansible, salt - are completely orthogonal to each other, and actually work really well together? A simple cycle like the following solves at least a couple of the problems mentioned in the article:<p>1) Run a base docker image.<p>2) Run the config management tool on/in this image, (ansible playbook,
chef cookbook, etc.)<p>3) Commit the container to the new image<p>Dockerfiles are very convenient and easy, and are great as far as they go. They also don&#x27;t have idempotent actions built-in. As a result, a minor change requires one to rebuild the entire image from scratch.<p>In contrast, the CM systems mentioned above operate by letting you declare the desired system state - i.e., <i>what</i> it is, instead of <i>how</i> to create it. This lets the CM system runtime automatically skip unnecessary steps. For example, in (say) an Ansible playbook, instead of (in the Dockerfile):<p><pre><code>  RUN mkdir -p /path/to/some/dir
</code></pre>
... we&#x27;d say something like (in the Ansible playbook):<p><pre><code>   - file:
       state: directory
       path: /path/to/some/dir
</code></pre>
If /path/to/some/dir already exists, and I run this play twice, I do not get the &quot;mkdir: cannot create directory ‘/path/to/some/dir’: File exists&quot; error, because this is designed to be declarative. That means: Ansible first checks whether the directory exists, and if it does, it does nothing. If it doesn&#x27;t, it recreates it.<p>It also helps a lot with surgical updates. For example, suppose my Dockerfile for a web service container contains the following:<p><pre><code>  RUN apt-get install -y apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5
</code></pre>
An analogous Ansible play might include the following:<p><pre><code>   - apt:
       name: &quot;{{ item }}&quot;
       state: present
     with_items:
       - apache2
       - php5
       - libapache2-mod-php5
</code></pre>
Now if an Apache security vulnerability is announced, with a fix pushed to the apt sources, I can rapidly modify the image like so:<p>1) Run the previous docker image.<p>2) Run the config management tool with the surgical-update action.<p>3) Commit the container to create an updated image.<p>The Ansible version of the update would be as simple as:<p><pre><code>   - apt:
       update_cache: yes
       name: apache2
       state: latest
</code></pre>
And again, this is a fast no-op if the package is already up-to-date. (It also doesn&#x27;t needlessly restart apache, though when creating an image that doesn&#x27;t matter much.)<p>Using a CM system like this doesn&#x27;t solve all the problems outlined in the article - actually, I don&#x27;t think it even solves a majority of them. But I can&#x27;t figure out why so many smart people are focused on reinventing parts of it poorly, or thinking in terms of &quot;docker vs. ansible/chef/puppet/salt&quot;. I know they&#x27;re not idiots. Am I missing something? If so I&#x27;d sincerely like to know.",1435785659

You care about and are proud of the code you write. You care about doing meaningful work and providing value to your clients or employer via well-crafted code. For you, writing code is not just a job but also a passion.<p>Test-Driven Development is second nature to you and that&#x27;s how you write code. You don&#x27;t use &quot;lack of time&quot; as an excuse to do a mediocre job, and fully understand the long-term costs and benefits of hacking a project together. You prefer to work in small increments, trying things out and iterating rapidly, tightening the feedback loop as much as possible.<p>You are a team player. You understand that software lives on long after it is first delivered, and that many different people will contribute to it over its lifetime. You enjoy working with other people, including other coders but also designers, business analysts, testers and anyone else working on the same project. You enjoy frequent collaboration, including pair-programming.<p>As a passionate developer, you spend a considerable amount of time outside working hours investing in your craft, learning new technologies and practicing different techniques and approaches. You create for creation&#x27;s sake, building pet projects or contributing to open-source development. You don&#x27;t do this because a client or employer asks you to; you do it because you want to.<p>As part of the learning process, you consider it important to share what you know with others. This might take the form of a blog, some code on GitHub, attendance at community events or something totally different. You also consider it your responsibility to help your fellow colleagues; perhaps this manifests itself as formal knowledge-sharing sessions in the workplace, but just as likely, it&#x27;s simply coaching as and when it&#x27;s necessary.<p>You understand that languages and frameworks are just tools. You choose the best tools for the job without being religious about it. The majority of books and articles you read are the ones that makes you a better developer and not a specialist in a specific framework. At the same time, you are extremely proficient with at least one or two programming languages and the tools around them, including testing frameworks, wiring and dependency injection mechanisms, user interface libraries and development environments.<p>You understand and embrace Agile processes, and are able to help other people to understand and adopt them. You are able to work closely with clients and product owners and help them to refine requirements and plan the work to be done.<p>You are proud to be a developer and want to remain a developer. You believe in emergent and collaborative architecture and design; you use your knowledge of SOLID principles, the Four Elements of Simple Design, and Domain-Driven Design to design applications that reflect the business domain.<p>If you believe you can meet the bar set, we are definitely interested in hearing from you.<p><a href=""http://codurance.com/careers/craftsman/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codurance.com/careers/craftsman/</a> for more info",1435785352

Penetration testing, security analysis, and cutting-edge research into current technologies and attacks (breaking things). You spend most of your day thinking about security systems and how they can break. You get to be creative and have a lot of freedom to be clever while learning new technologies at a very fast pace. Engagements are usually 2-4 weeks long and in a year you will be exposed to 15-20 products and technology stacks. Your work will typically initiate person-months of security improvements in products millions of people use. You will have access to senior engineers/architects and your findings/ideas will be heard by senior decision makers. You will have enormous impact in making the software people use safer.

9815178,comment,9804777,9813864,0,0,bane,,,"Right, so I&#x27;m asserting that the parameter usually called for in big-O analysis of hash table operations is the wrong one since it measures the lookup complexity and not the hashing complexity, which is usually O(n). And this results in meaningless complexity analysis which gives you things like &quot;Insert is O(1) on Average but O(n) Worst Case or Θ(n)&quot;.<p>This analysis is using the hash table length as the parameter under consideration, but that&#x27;s silly, because most of the complexity of hash-tables is in the hashing which (depending on the hash function) usually has a known complexity of O(n). Where n is the length of the input string.<p>This is far more important in hash table complexity analysis than table size because this part of the operation dominates runtime.<p>You can also do multi-paramter big-O analysis. O(mn) is a thing for example, with two differently sized parameters, both of which contribute to the complexity of the algorithm and can&#x27;t be dismissed.<p>So charitably, if you need to provide a big-O for say, hash table inserts, it&#x27;s reasonable to say O(mn) where m is the length of the table and n is the length of the input string, but it&#x27;s not necessary since table length usually has little contribution to the complexity of the algorithm...hence why people keep saying inserts are O(1) on average, because table length isn&#x27;t much of a determinant in hash table operation complexity. Just like big-O hides constants, we can hide parameters that are dominated by another. O(1) is doing this backwards.<p>My guess is that O(1) is some weird cargo-culted remnant from some early work done on Hash tables as a generalization of Arrays, likely from when the hash functions were just modulus operations on integer keys or some other simple, fixed length hashing method that was easy to ignore (like the universal hash in Corman&#x27;s &quot;Introduction to Algorithms&quot;. But modern hash-tables can&#x27;t make these assumptions and I, and quite a few other folks, think that this needs to be rethought.<p>Some examples (I don&#x27;t agree with all of these, but I think it makes the point):<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2771368/can-hash-tables-really-be-o1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2771368/can-hash-tables-...</a><p><a href=""http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2009/08/18/do-hash-tables-work-in-constant-time/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2009/08/18/do-hash-tables-wor...</a><p>> Sound like a analytic club that&#x27;s rarely accurate to real-world performance?

Our dataset is increasingly large and complex as our analyses are complex and need to be done in near real-time. You work with our distributed engineering team and our CEO and Head of Business Development on product iteration.<p>PortfolioStrat is a cloud-based trading workflow tool SaaS Platform Portfolio Manager for hedge funds, asset managers, and other sophisticated investors. The platform helps professional investors generate investment ideas through screens and advanced analysis and visualization with statistical analyses, machine learning / data science, and other overlays. We are a team of former hedge fund portfolio managers, investment bank quants and technologists work to connect all parts of the professional investor&#x27;s workflow in the cloud.
We have recently launched a beta product that has been 1.5 years in development and is backed by over 7 years of prototyping, IP, and industry knowledge. We have 10-20 hedge fund clients who have signed up to be early users of the platform and have signed a major broker to use it.
The two co-founders are looking to disrupt the entire investment workflow of a front office portfolio manager stuck on Bloomberg and Excel spreadsheets. We are closing our seed round now and have previously raised a round of friends and family capital last year.",1435784612

And if you control your typing environments, it&#x27;s better to stay with Dvorak than to switch back to Qwerty.  But the cost of learning is still greater than the amount of comfort you would get.<p>And your typing speed will NOT increase with Dvorak. Typing speed is mostly due to alternating hands when you type; Qwerty is perfectly fine for that use case.",1435784611

It said ""Internet"", not ""Browser"", so I thought it was some dumb app that Sprint put on to show me how amazing a phone with ""Internets"" was.  Nope, it's actually the web browser.  Why not just call it that?<p>Do people like HTC's random animations?  Do I really need to see lightning flash when I unlock my phone because there was a thunderstorm at the airport an hour ago?  I much prefer Google's more tasteful weather widget -- a simple icon representing the weather and the temperature.  Then I don't have to use more than half my screen for an extra clock and a huge picture of a cloud.  Looks great in advertising materials, looks terrible in real life.  (Of course, you can just remove the widget, so that's not a big deal.)<p>But it does show you the overall idea behind sense -- stupid gimmicks to make phones more exciting to people that can barely afford the monthly contract fee for a smartphone.  Good for them, not good for me.  So I kill it.<p>My biggest beef with Sense is that they put so many gimmicks on the keyboard that there isn't any room for the letter keys.  I want to type on the keyboard, not be impressed that they have half-working text-to-speech.  On the stock android keyboard, I can get a fucking comma without having to go to the alternate keyboard.  On the sense keyboard, nope.<p>If HTC wants to see how to improve, they should look at the Droid X keyboard.  That thing is great.

Would their mathetmatic be isomorphic with ours? Would they have just their own versions of caluculs, set theory, topology, differential geometry, etc. with just some minor differences? As most of mathematics is based on few simple axioms (from which more complex 'things' are derived[1]) this seems quite unlikely - but on the other hand 'basic and simple' may mean something completely different to them; for example classic geometry for creatures whose vision is not main sense would kind of awkward, also they wouldn't probably think of some integrals as an area.<p>[1] At least that is how I see mathematics right now as a math/cs student; please correct me if I am mistaken.",1278931657

Return 0\n  (there is no inode number 0) in case of error.\n</code></pre>\nCompletely off-topic, but there is a bug in this prototype: Inode numbers have type <i>ino_t</i>, not type <i>unsigned long</i>.<p>(Ok, two bugs, if you count the fact that there can theoretically be an inode number 0.  And three bugs if you count the fact that <i>pathname</i> should be declared as a (const char *).  But the ino_t vs. unsigned long bug is really bad if you care about portability.)",1278929165

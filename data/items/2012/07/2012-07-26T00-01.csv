4293860,comment,4293530,4293812,26,0,sounds,,,"While your concerns are legitimate - content should not control infrastructure; look at cellular carriers for the case study - there are also wins that are worth thinking about.<p>Not to be Pollyana; Google needs to be watched. So we all keep each other in check. The following disruptive moves benefit Google _and_ your average Joe:<p>1. Reduce bandwidth costs. Google pays to send data and we pay to receive it. This is just your classic elimination of the middleman, in this case the anti-competitive backbone and last-mile carriers. In theory the first to benefit from this are the startups with large bandwidth bills today.<p>2. Reduce delays associated with new tech. Google wants new tech like a larger TCP Initial Congestion Window [1], IPv6, SPDY / HTTP 2.0, or Strict Transport Security [2] to happen faster. As long as your average Joe has a fast enough pipe, these are a win-win. The lag in adoption comes from slow-moving risk-averse players, such as incumbent backbone providers.<p>3. Reduce mobile bandwidth costs. Google is already heavily invested in mobile broadband clients. In especially congested areas like New York, anything to reduce mobile broadband costs benefits Android first: the top tier of customers who don't feel the costs are probably using iOS.<p>There are more win-win situations but those are my top 3.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tcpm-initcwnd-00"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tcpm-initcwnd-00</a>

Those who control or curate content (Google, NBC/Comcast, Facebook) should not control infrastructure. This was less of a concern when Google was acting as a <i>conduit</i> of information, but as Google moves to treat personal (if aggregate) data as property and profits from user-generated data like YouTube or Google+, the lines become significantly blurred.<p>There may be nothing wrong intrinsically with controlling content and infrastructure, but it seems to be bad for consumers generally, as exhibited by Comcast[0]. And while a high-speed competitor to local cable monopolies is exciting, I worry about trading one dictator for another just because there's some competition in the transition period from the old guard to the new.<p>Is there some safeguard in place Kansas City and other fiber recipients have arranged to prevent Google from having the power to exert cable-esque control?

4293750,comment,4293530,4293658,5,0,Laremere,,,"There is something that I call the paradox of Google.  The only real content which Google makes that I can think of is their front page doodles.  They are an entirely service focused company.  For the most part google products fall into two categories:  Services which serve advertisements, or services which feed into category one.  Their entire strategy is to use content created by other people (websites in search, videos in youtube, etc.) to give a reason to provide content people pay them for you to see (ads.)  Therefor the paradox lies in this: In order to grow and thrive as a company they must keep the internet free.  If the web is monopolized by a small number of large corporations, the need for Google to facilitate access to a large number of small websites diminishes.  Youtube is their most resilient platform to this notion, and even it requires companies to remain small enough where using Youtube's service still makes sense.  Also, this is why I think their products are so good:  Every last little bit of quality in a product allows that much larger of a company to still find it more useful to use Google as their gateway to the web.  
So all in all, having a major website be an isp may be dangerous, but powers which guide Google guide it to be an open portal to a free web, instead of being the one stop content shop.

The experience is the sale, not the asset. That said, the other company I'm watching in this space is Blizzard which recently opened up their real money 'auctions' for items in Diablo III. This legitimizes what has been an underground industry for years and recognizes that there is some business value in trading ""products"" made out of bits instead of materials. Unlike Zynga the Blizzard scheme has users selling to users and Blizzard just takes a percentage. If the model generates any serious revenue at all for Blizzard I would expect Zynga to follow suit, allowing Farmville users whose cow births a gold medal calf or something to trade that for Zyngian currency or even real money. These businesses have to be careful not to create an actual currency because the government will shut that down, but trading virtual goods has so far passed muster on that score.[1]<p>That said, the analysis I've seen on Zynga games relates the pleasure not from the virtual farming, so much as the chance to get more out than you put in (the gambling rush as it is known in Las Vegas). You plant your farm and you get a golden bean or something that is now 'valuable' as opposed to all those other times you planted and got regular beans. Its a powerful tool, wielded well by Zynga and others.<p>[1] You will know you are trouble when your customer wants to pay you with rare gear from Diablo or extra egg laying chickens or something.",1343261651

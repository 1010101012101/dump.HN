8190760,comment,8190641,8190641,34,0,SoftwareMaven,,,"I would imagine a lot of the concern over this is more of the existential fear resulting from the balance of power between patient and doctor than anything else. The Internet started that, with patients able to become much more knowledgable about their own conditions (with the unfortunate side effect of every symptom being cancer).<p>Once patients become knowledgable, the doctor moves from a pillar of all knowledge to a (hopefully) trusted, knowledgable advisor. That change frightens many in the medical community[1], but it will yield better outcomes.<p>My own story is one of overcoming obesity and, at times, nearly crippling depression using that ability to gain knowledge to learn how to feed my body. In the process, I&#x27;ve stopped medications and have had to teach my doctor certain things (like why I&#x27;m not gong to either worry about my cholesterol or take any drugs for it).<p>The medical community currently has an abysmal record with treating chronic health problems. There are a lot of reasons for that, but, IMO, the most glaring is people abdicating their health reonsibility to somebody else (whether doctors, pharmaceutical companies, or government guidelines). As people take control back...when they realize they have some control...they will become more healthy.<p>1. Source: my wife is part of that community and sees it regularly.",1408316146

8190752,comment,8188919,8189225,1,0,l33tbro,,,"&quot;Is this like saying most hospital patients should take responsibility for their own society&#x27;s health-care system?&quot;<p>Yes, they should.<p>Look, you&#x27;re right, it is beyond the scope of the average person to research alternatives.  However, we live in a democratic society and it is out of our political apathy that the healthcare system has become what it is: an utter disgrace.  If we were a truly compassionate society that prioritized ensuing health-care for all, then this is what we would have.<p>Same goes for online.  We love to bitch and moan about the government taking away net neutrality, our friends and parents thinking the internet is just Facebook, and of course the NSA.  But it is us - you, I, our communities - that are creating this situation; not the government.  Why?  Because we are the government.<p>Am I aware of how idealistic that sounds in 2014?  Absolutely.  But we are the ones who, ultimately, decide what level of lobbying and influence corporations have.  We are the ones who ultimately decide what level of survelience we allow in our lives.<p>That was my initial point.  But of course, HN folks can be super-reacitionary to anything detracting from the open-source caliphate.  Believe me, no one wants a more bio-diverse online ecosystem than I.  I&#x27;ve written extensively about it.  However, this is the issue it comes down to.  We get what we deserve.  What&#x27;s more, if these were important issues in society (which I, in the minority, believe theyt are) then it would galvanize into actual policy being created.<p>We&#x27;re in the West.  We have democratic ideals. Utilize them.  Our entire system and culture is based upon these.  It&#x27;s what justifies wars.  If you&#x27;re not happy about the system, lobby your friends and create movements.<p>Ironically, this is what the Pirate Bay guys have done.  they&#x27;ve gone out and come at IP in a major way, and have felt the might of the law against their favour.  I&#x27;m not going to comment on whether that&#x27;s right or wrong, because it isn&#x27;t the issue.  The issue is that we, now, through the sum part of a billion tiny actions, have the chance in this moment to influence the future of this space.  The future of IP.  The future of rewarding creators fairly.  So instead of whinging about Big Internet (which is what happens a lot in this forum - where cries go unheard) - actually take some practical steps to lobby.<p>So that is why.  We get the internet we deserve is that we must take collective responsibility for what kind of world we are creating.  Unfortunatley, this is a highly unfashionable stance in age of cynicism and entitlement.",1408316001

Mind blown!<p>Huge blast of nostalgia: Back in the summer of 2006 when I was learning git for the first time (and leaving svn in the process), there was all this uncertainty in the community about which VCS was the best... a lot of people weren&#x27;t even sure that DVCS was a good idea at all! Even so, the Linux kernel had been using git for a year at the time.<p>At the time there were git, and mercurial, bazaar, bitkeeper and its controversies... and I distinctly remember reading about Monotone! I remember reading how it was the inspiration for git&#x27;s DAG. I was intrigued but sadly never actually tried Monotone because I was already too blown away by learning git.<p>It&#x27;s funny. Git completely changed the way I thought about coding. Made me really, <i>really</i> realize the value of good data structures, and what a waste of effort parsing is. As a direct result, I became obsessed with an idea in late 2006--this idea of a truly next-generation programming environment. This idea of a language+editor+VCS where the ASTs and entire edit history would be stored in git&#x27;s DAG. [1] So I worked on that for a while, but never really got anywhere...<p>... and then in late 2012, along comes Rust, which fulfills the language part of this language+editor+VCS trifecta in my mind. And Rust was a personal project by Graydon! So I&#x27;m just realizing now that Graydon conceived not only my ideal language, but also my ideal VCS! So that&#x27;s why my mind&#x27;s blown.<p>In short, Graydon is a prolific badass.<p>[1] It&#x27;s really a very old idea of course; as old as Smalltalk.

These ketones can lead to serious kidney damage, or even kidney failure. Your point about hypoglycemia is dead on though.<p>As a type I diabetic myself, carbs are actually life saving during a low blood sugar episode (and low blood sugars actually occur more often for type I diabetics with tight control).

1711938,comment,1709308,1711436,0,0,Robin_Message,,,"Indeed. I also thought the following comment from Scribd showed what is wrong with their mindset:<p><pre><code>  As a start-up, we're constantly trying to strike the right\n  balance: building products that people love but that also\n  help us make money (to cover server cost and everything\n  else associated with running a company).\n</code></pre>\nUmm, surely as a company you are trying to do more than cover your running costs? Or are the saying ""As a start-up"" profitability is irrelevant and all they care about is covering their costs whilst increasing their market share? A larger share in a market no-one is actually willing to pay for is not worth more than a smaller one, what with them both being worth nothing and all.",1285059479

1711924,comment,1711192,1711865,0,0,jasonjei,,,"I think you are giving a college education too much credit. There are definitely exceptions to the rule, but one of my best engineers has been at it since the 70s, and has no degree in electrical engineering but in math, and what of the hackers that have been programming such as RMS before it became a real, hardened discipline (before a CS degree was offered)?<p>The best and most dedicated need no degree to validate their talents. MIT is a fine school, but I would be even more impressed if they could take an average student and turn him into a programming whiz. The best learners are often self taught, which is why the PhD program works to an extent (free labor for the school, self education for the PhD student). How are you so certain a degree less programmer couldn't program an OS, or code a linked list library from scratch? Arrington's a lawyer--how was it that he got into an agreement without documenting it on paper (maybe that JD is just a piece of paper)?<p>A lot of college graduates seem to think they are entitled to jobs, when they haven't proven they can program.  I've met a BA Chinese grad who can't speak Chinese to save his life (I spent my middle school years in Taiwan, I have no degree in Chinese), or the English grad who can't write. Having a degree means you studied the subject, it doesn't mean you are an expert at it. Especially not with an undergrad degree. They spend 2-3 years on remedial high school, and spend maybe a year and a half on their discipline.<p>Like anything in life, there are no absolutes. I can say though that the ones most driven go beyond a piece of paper. Having one helps. But having one doesn't mean you're better, you just paid your dues in cash and time. It might just give you the edge you need, but the last thing I look at it in a programmer is for a degree. I seem to recall reading that one of the main Linux kernel committers has a degree in music. That hardly gives him the credentials to be playing with an OS internals by your reasoning.<p>It's like the culinary school example. You'll be on a much better footing with a degree, but it doesn't mean you're better. A lot of culinary school graduates end up cooking banquets at country clubs.  Some chefs, like Pizzeria Bianco's Chris Bianco (where NYT proclaimed the best pizza is not in NYC but in AZ) have no paper to prove but hard knocks.",1285058951

These people have a high income, but they also have high level of spending and they have nowhere near the assets to support their lifestyles.<p>So, rather than being rich, they are wage slaves with high incomes.<p>When you have enough money to stop working and still have the lifestyle you want, your life is completely different.

Just because we can say ""This person is generally more attractive because of facial symmetry, well-aligned teeth, and x,y,z"" doesn't mean we have any particularly useful quotient to judge the attractiveness of a person.  Such a general measure is way too broad.  And you missed my point: the perception of physical attraction is not based solely on physical traits!  Look at Sarah Palin--some would say she's attractive, but if you mentally recoil at the thought of a Palin presidential run I'm sure you would not think so.<p>Your amateur video productions _prove my point_ because the attractiveness is in the ordinary, the ""just a person at home making a video.""  It is in the fact that the person is presumably contributing something valuable.

I am far more ashamed of that than proud, however.<p>From the article:<p>> <i>Statistics like those put out by the College Board are misleading: they promote a foolish sense of tunnel vision, leading students to believe that the only possible way of obtaining even a middle-wage job is through the traditional, four-year college route.</i><p>...<p>> <i>...certain industries—business services, health care, education, and particularly manufacturing—have had record increases in middle-wage job openings, with not nearly enough qualified applicants to fill the positions.</i><p>Business services ... doesn't require schooling, depending on the service. That's pretty broad, though. Health care? Requires schooling. Education? Schooling. Manufacturing? That's not middle-wage unless ... schooling.<p>> <i>Companies manufacturing high-precision products—car and aircraft parts, large-scale construction equipment—encounter a dearth of workers with the mathematical and technical skills necessary to operate computer-controlled machines...</i><p>Mathematical and technical skills ... that would be, schooling, and ... schooling.<p>> <i>Thus, the positions remain unfilled, because the American educational system does not currently produce enough job candidates with the technical expertise to perform in the “blue-collar” jobs of the twenty-first century.</i><p>This is ridiculous. Does anyone here really expect to attend a four-year college, or even two years at a local college, to be a plumber? Or electrician? Or computer tech? This is blatantly conflating trades with education.<p>OK, maybe there's another point here I'm not getting. I'll give the article a fair shake ...<p>> <i>It is in this respect that the prevailing “college for all” philosophy is most misguided...</i><p>ARGH. This article <i>really is</i> saying that kids don't need to learn math, because they can work in a factory instead. They don't need to learn English, because they can swing a hammer instead. They don't need to learn history, because they can wrench on a car.<p>Yet, if they're going to have an opportunity to be part of the force that could renew U.S. industry, they <i>need</i> to know math, English, and history. They <i>need</i> to be able to look at their job and <i>calculate</i> production waste, and make processes more efficient; they need to know how to measure things; they need to be able to quantify things. They need to be able to communicate their findings clearly and effectively, and with a minimum of misunderstanding. and they <i>really</i> need to understand the past; they need to know what's been tried before, and what did and didn't work, and why. I would love, sometime, to hear someone else say, ""Henry Ford didn't invent the automobile! He just realized that he could build cars really efficiently if he built them like guns, with lots of cheap, interchangeable parts.""<p>The possibly apocryphal example of Chris <i>was not</i> a failure of the education system; it was a failure of a social system (and, probably, familial system, and many other systems), and that social system is failing in large part because much of it wants to believe that nobody <i>needs</i> to know anything about anything, and that it's somehow wrong to have a solid general education, or that it's even possible to be ""over-educated"".<p>I condemn this English teacher to a hell in which everyone communicates via YouTube comments.<p>edit: Just to be clear, I am -- and have been for a very long time -- in favor of increasing the amount of trades classes in high schools, mostly because I think it's valuable to have multiple skills.

Our ""niche"" is the consumer ecommerce/online retail market.<p>The pain points we are aiming to solve are arguably well-documented in the ecommerce industry: traffic and conversions. We are trying to leverage the power of social networks to optimize the sales funnel as well as drive organic word-of-mouth marketing on social networks.

There's tons of interesting work going on within large organizations, and they often let you work on problems that you can only dream about.  The difference is that as an employee, you're usually contractually obligated to keep your mouth shut about your solutions and let others rediscover them on their own.",1285056709

Money spent in taxes is always considered ""lost"" [1].  Consider somewhere like Sweden.  Tax rates go above 50%, but for that money they get health care, college for as high as they're capable of going (even room and board while they're attending!), etc., etc.  So those are all things they don't have to spend their own money on.  At the end of the day should we care about how much of our money the government touches, or about the quality of life we can have?<p>[1] Of course in America there may be some truth to it given the kinds of things money gets used for by the US government.",1285056708

The whole schooling system is built around monitoring student progress.\n> I think the best way to help our kids develop these skills is going to be through lots of monitoring. It&#x27;s certainly good to question the effectiveness of monitoring, and what it&#x27;s encouraging, so I respect that sentiment of the other posters, but really? Outrage?</i><p>I don&#x27;t think you realize the damage all this pervasive monitoring will do to warp and stress people&#x27;s minds, being subjected to it 24/7 from early childhood. It will take away all awareness that <i>they</i> are the directors of their own life. It will condition them to constantly act for the benefit of an unseen observer instead of living their life for themselves and being unafraid to walk off the beaten path. And yes that includes being able to cram for a 5th grade history test the night before, it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re handing in their Master&#x27;s Thesis.",1401123569

7800536,comment,7799524,7800041,5,0,illumen,,,"Currently python 3 packages ported are at about 10.9% according to pypi.  This isn&#x27;t including separate source downloads, so I guess the number would be higher by a few percentage points.<p>There was a post by Alex Gaynor in January [0] about downloads for python 3 being at 2.4%.  But that was before python 3.4 came out, and before some major libraries were <i>finally</i> ported like Twisted.  Twisted not being ported was one of the main blockers for python 3 in the last Ubuntu release [1].  Once more distros improve their python 3 support, things will get exponentially better for python 3.  Continuous integration servers inflate numbers because they re-download things, and there is the CDN which makes all these numbers highly inaccurate.<p>Lots of things have been ported since January, like pycurl, pyOpenSSL, bugzilla [2], etc.  Because of the big pushes by Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Mozilla, and Gnome [3] communities amongst many others.  Things have improved greatly in a few months.<p>Distros, and apps like Sublime Text 3 moving to python 3, along with some of the major missing pieces will help uptake significantly.  Almost all packages in Fedora come with python 3 packages now.  But the key to increasing python 3 adoption is Apple, and python 3 on OS X.  Many of the python packages that come with OS X are now ported to python 3 (Twisted, cups, pyobjc, etc) ... but who knows what they have planned?  I guess we&#x27;ll see June-ish.<p>[0] <a href=""http://alexgaynor.net/2014/jan/03/pypi-download-statistics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alexgaynor.net/2014/jan/03/pypi-download-statistics/</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Python/FoundationsTPythonVersions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Python/FoundationsTPythonVersions</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://fedorahosted.org/python-bugzilla/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fedorahosted.org/python-bugzilla/</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show//Initiatives/GnomeGoals/Python3Porting?action=show&redirect=GnomeGoals%2FPython3Porting"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show//Initiatives/GnomeGoals/P...</a>",1401123517

7800488,comment,7798919,7799091,4,0,xyzzy123,,,"I found the article pretty rewarding, here&#x27;s my attempt at a summary:<p>The article is about the OSSI (Open Source Seed Initiative).<p>Since 1985 it&#x27;s possible to get &quot;utility patents&quot; for plants. This allows you to claim that something like &quot;easily harvestable broccoli&quot; (say a breed with a specific shaped head) is your unique invention. Plant breeders are worried about the same chilling effects we see in software patents. Breeding something like &quot;really red carrots&quot; could get you sued. This is not an academic concern as thousands of patents are being filed.<p>Big companies are (naturally) treating the patent-ability of plant breeds and traits as a &quot;land rush&quot;, an opportunity to lock away whatever profitable ideas they can.  This is viewed as an encroachment on the commons by old-school plant breeders, who note that many of the specific things being patented have been worked on for decades (or maybe, thousands of years if you look at the big picture) in basically an open-source manner. They value seed freedom in the same way as a hacker might view freedom of code and ideas.<p>Plant breeding experts and enthusiasts have been working for years to oppose this trend, or at least carve out some reasonable exceptions, but things just seem to be getting worse.<p>Major &quot;industrial&quot; crops like corn and soybeans are pretty much locked down, covered by 500 and 250 patents respectively in 1999 (more today). Today, it would be hard to grow those in a commercially viable way without using someone&#x27;s IP.<p>Now there is more interest in vegetables by multinationals. This seems much worse to OSSI because it covers a wider variety of &quot;things people eat&quot; and encroaches on non-industrial breeders and growers more.<p>Tired of lobbying and &quot;slow change&quot;, the group in the article wanted to create a movement like the free software movement, but for seeds. However,  there&#x27;s no legal basis for copyleft in this area because patents are different from copyright. Copyright is automatic, allowing easy &quot;copylefting&quot;. To apply this scheme to patents, they would have to apply for patents for each of their breeds or traits before they can dictate licensing terms, which would be onerous, expensive and still legally dubious.<p>The group couldn&#x27;t find a way to construct a copyleft system for seeds, but they&#x27;re still intent on creating and popularizing a movement.

In the case of schools, they should be monitoring student interaction in order to gain insights in how to improve their system, just as any website does. How are we supposed to improve the education system if getting quantitative data is outrageous?<p>If you&#x27;re outraged at this software are you also outraged at all of the awesome new developments in ed tech to create self-paced curriculums? Those involve plenty of monitoring as well.<p>When I went through the education system, I was seen as a genius in elementary school. I scored in the 99th percentile in math on the standardized tests, and participated in the advanced math tracks two years early. I was on track to be very successful. Then middle school came along.<p>First half of sixth grade, I continued my performance from elementary school, doing extremely well. Then I started with the destructive questions I&#x27;m sure a lot of HNers are familiar with: &quot;Why do I need to learn this?&quot;, &quot;Am I ever going to use this in real life?&quot;. This is when the grades started tanking, and I basically didn&#x27;t participate in my education. I didn&#x27;t recover from this terrible attitude until I entered college.<p>I never really established any study habits, and it&#x27;s something that still weighs me down now, graduated from college and in the workforce. To relate to the story, I wish these sorts of programs were available when I was a student. I wish I was graded on my study habits even in elementary school.<p>I don&#x27;t really understand the defense of cramming. The goal of school is not to pass all of the tests with high scores, the goal of school is to establish strong habits that will optimize your education and your effectiveness in your future profession.<p>I think the best way to help our kids develop these skills is going to be through lots of monitoring. It&#x27;s certainly good to question the effectiveness of monitoring, and what it&#x27;s encouraging, so I respect that sentiment of the other posters, but really? Outrage?<p>Lets encourage our school system to try new things, measure the effectiveness, and readjust based on data. I would really love to steer this debate away from whining about being free to choose less effective study techniques and monitoring. Monitoring is essential to providing adjustments on a per-student basis, allowing highly customizable content for the most efficient education.<p>Edit: I guess I should have known better than to make a dissenting comment on this type of article.",1401122700

7800430,comment,7798919,7798919,6,0,decode,,,"An interesting hack is described near the end:<p><pre><code>  Jim Myers began breeding a plant he now calls “The O.P.,”\n  which stands for “open-pollinated.” Until then, his broccoli\n  were either hybrids or inbreds, created by a process of\n  narrowing the genetics until one select mother is bred with\n  one select father to create a single, most desirable combination\n  of genes. The O.P., by contrast, is the result of a\n  horticultural orgy. Myers began with twenty-three different\n  broccoli hybrids and inbreds, including some of the lines\n  behind the exserted-head trait. He let insects cross-pollinate\n  them en masse, and the resulting plants were crossed at random\n  again—and again, and again, four generations in a row. He then\n  sent germplasm to farmers around the country, had them grow it\n  in their fields, and send back the seed they collected. Over\n  the winter, Myers bred it in another greenhouse orgy, then\n  sent it back to farmers. For six years, he repeated this process.\n\n  The broccoli evolved in two ways simultaneously. The\n  back-and-forth of the breeding scrambled the plants’ genetics,\n  making the germplasm wildly diverse. It also let the environment\n  whittle away at individual genes. For instance, plants without\n  pest resistance produced less seed or simply died, reducing\n  their presence in the gene pool. When it was hot, plants that\n  could tolerate heat produced more seed, increasing their\n  presence. Survival of the fittest.\n\n  In the seventh year, Myers sent most of the seed back to the\n  farmers—just gave it to them, without licenses, royalties or\n  restrictions. The idea was that each farmer would adapt that\n  dynamic gene pool to his or her farm’s particular climate and\n  conditions, selecting the best plants every year to refine the\n  population. In other words, they could breed it themselves. In\n  time, each would end up with his or her own perfect broccoli.\n\n  The beauty of the O.P. is that rather than challenge the\n  intellectual-property system, it inherently rejects the concept\n  of ownership. It contains many of the desirable genetics of\n  Myers’s commercial broccoli lines, but in a package that is\n  designed to be shared, not owned. Because it is open-pollinated,\n  not a hybrid, its seeds can be saved by any farmer. And because\n  it is genetically diverse, it would be difficult to pin down\n  with a patent. Even if someone did claim to own it, because each\n  new seedling is a little different, that claim would be all but\n  impossible to enforce.

First, which data are wrong? ...<p>> &quot;Capital&quot; is a sprawling book based on an enormous pile of reference material and data. Much of the data was collected by Mr Piketty and other economists in a series of published papers that have since been used to create the World Top Incomes Database. None of this work appears to be at issue. Rather, Mr Giles focuses on wealth inequality, to which Mr Piketty turns in Chapter 10 of his book. Mr Piketty has not published nearly as much research on the question of wealth inequality, and it seems that much of the analysis in Chapter 10 was done specifically for the book, based on others&#x27; research. Mr Piketty&#x27;s wealth-inequality analysis certainly matters as a component of the book&#x27;s argument, but it is not accurate to say, as Mr Giles does, that the results in Chapter 10 constitute the &quot;central theme&quot; of the book.<p>So your two proposition are not contradictory. Piketty&#x27;s principle historical work was published before the book, in peer-reviewed journals, and that is different from the analysis which is being criticized.",1401121768

Like I said, I think debating the claim that free weights are safer is totally fair; it seems the real conversation is about which type of safety the other is talking about.<p>As for the deadlift, I get your point. I do think that you are making it an either-or thing, in that you&#x27;re either piling on mass with the deadlift or your not getting stronger. Athletes don&#x27;t do starting strength, they should be using the deadlift as part of a well-rounded training routine rather than trying to set PR after PR. I agree with you that a singular focus on deadlifts/squats for most athletes is detrimental, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it has no place whatsoever. I&#x27;d also bet against the athlete who focused on it in such a way.<p>Anecdotally though, I&#x27;ve found the deadlift to be very functional for me. And who are you to say that someone moving from 135 to a 350lb deadlift, and then <i>maybe</i> to 500lbs isn&#x27;t impressive?

Since than we&#x27;ve improved Pony and now it got a query optimizer which replaces subqueries with efficient JOINs where it is possible.\nHere is the query from that presentation:<p><pre><code>    >>> select(c for c in Customer if sum(c.orders.total_price) > 1000)[:]\n</code></pre>\nThe straightforward way is to use a subquery here, but Pony&#x27;s optimizer produces LEFT JOIN because such query usually has better performance:<p><pre><code>    SELECT `c`.`id`\n    FROM `customer` `c`\n      LEFT JOIN `order` `order-1`\n        ON `c`.`id` = `order-1`.`customer`\n    GROUP BY `c`.`id`\n    HAVING coalesce(SUM(`order-1`.`total_price`), 0) > 1000\n</code></pre>\nIn our opinion this is the main advantage of Pony ORM - the possibility to perform semantic transformations of a query in order to produce performat SQL while keeping the text of Python query as high level as possible.",1401121132

In particular, knowing that a student who is struggling is not studying or is only attempting to cram at the last minute could be useful information for finding a strategy to help that student to improve.<p>I think the real problem is that many of the students I see (I teach CS at a small college) are focused on the external artifacts of education --- grades, a degree, etc. --- and not the actual learning.  If students don&#x27;t see an intrinsic value in what they are doing, they will try to game the system by cheating, memorizing instead of learning more deeply, etc.  Over time I have come to realize that one of my duties as an educator is to try to motivate students to learn.

7800286,comment,7799524,7799938,8,0,rowyourboat,,,"Historically, when the computing world only knew about English, a character was represented by a byte. That led to a string being essentially byte array. As such, the concepts of a byte and a char and a buffer and a string were often used interchangeably (in fact, the 8-bit-type in C is called char). With Unicode and the need to parse international text, however, a character can no longer be represented as a simple byte, and things have become messy.<p>Python3 finally cleanly separates the concepts of a &quot;byte&quot; (8 bits) and a &quot;character&quot; (which now is an abstraction). A String is now a collection of characters and no longer functionally equivalent to an array of bytes.<p>This change is normally welcomed by people who have to deal with multiple languages and encodings anyway, as making the conceptual difference between a character and a byte explicit makes dealing with text much easier. However, if you were used to thinking of strings as byte arrays and not as &quot;the data type for text&quot;, you might have a hard time.",1401120205

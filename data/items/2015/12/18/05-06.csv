Generators are a way to not make expensive computations until you have to--as well as to not use memory that you don&#x27;t need. Basically, if all you&#x27;re doing with a collection of items is iterating over it (which covers a lot of use cases--but perhaps not yours), you should use a generator, not a list--your code will run faster and use less memory.<p><i>>  In most use cases (scripting) lists are much easier to use (no interleaving of side effects) and there is plenty of memory available to force them.</i><p>Generators don&#x27;t have to have side effects. And there are plenty of use cases for which you do not have &quot;plenty of memory available&quot; (again, perhaps not yours).<p><i>> IMHO generators by default is a bad choice.</i><p>I think lists by default was a bad choice, because it forces everyone to incur the memory and performance overhead of constructing a list whether they need to or not. The default should be the leaner of the two alternatives; people who need or prefer the extra overhead can then get it by using list() (or a list comprehension instead of a generator expression, which is just a matter of typing brackets instead of parentheses).",1450417300

10756852,comment,10756113,10756113,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Possible reasons you might find more slow-speed minor rear-end collisions among self-driving cars than among human-driven cars on a per-mile basis:<p>1. There are only a tiny number of self-driving cars on the road, driving a relatively small number of miles, and accidents in general are fairly rare on a per-mile basis, so there might not yet be enough data to get a reliable idea of average crash rate. The linked study is based on analysis of only 11 (!!) crashes, 8 of which were at <5 mph, with only 2 causing “possible injuries”. As the study itself says, <i>“[...] the corresponding 95% confidence intervals overlap. Therefore, we currently cannot rule out, with a reasonable level of confidence, the possibility that the actual rate for self-driving vehicles is lower than for conventional vehicles.”</i> (Personally I think their confidence intervals for self-driving cars are useless given the data so far, but whatever.)<p>2. The Google cars which account for all of the cited crashes are AFAIK doing all of their driving on city streets, where intersections, stops, and thus these types of collisions are more common than on highways.<p>3. I suspect most tiny bumper bumps which don’t damage either car or injure anyone are never reported to the police when both drivers are people, but self-driving cars record every case.<p>4. Self-driving cars have better sensors to detect road hazards, and as a result might stop in cases where a human driver would do something which risked a more serious accident. People tail-gating these cars will end up unable to react in time and bumping them, but even these 11 crashes might have been in situations where the autonomous car stopping prevented more severe car damage or injuries.<p>5. Driving cautiously and strictly limiting speed to 25mph might make following human drivers frustrated and more likely to tail closely. This might be exacerbated by the Google cars’ goofy appearance. (Would be interesting to see statistics for various skills/styles of human drivers, or for human-driven NEVs.) I’m not sure NEV accidents can be meaningfully compared to standard car accidents.<p>Overall I think this topic is worthy of study, but the data is not really all that useful yet. Keith Naughton’s Bloomberg piece calling this a “key flaw” seems like high-order FUD / clickbait.",1450417018

Subscripting a string would use the array of indices.<p>Only a few standard member functions of string (find, rfind, index, rindex) return integer subscripts into a string.  Those could return an opaque index object which has an index and a link to the string.  Such objects could be used for string operations which need a string index.  If an index object is forcibly converted to an integer, the array of indices has to be generated, but otherwise, it is unnecessary.

10756842,comment,10756684,10756684,0,0,lkrubner,,,"For the last 16 years, I&#x27;ve mostly worked with startups. Most of them have offered me stock options. I&#x27;ve never made a penny from stock options. I don&#x27;t take stock options seriously. If the goal is to find a way to give me an incentive to work hard, then stock options don&#x27;t work for me, because I don&#x27;t believe in them. They lack enough believability for me to get emotionally amped about them. And yet, that kind of excitement is suppose to be the point, yes? The startup that hires me has the option of simply paying me a salary in exchange for my professional services. But they want me to be excited enough that I&#x27;ll work lots of 60 and 70 hour weeks. So they want to give me an extra incentive. So they offer stock options, but as I said, for me personally, stocks options fail completely as an incentive.<p>I could also write a long comment about how often I get into negotiations that take the form of &quot;We&#x27;d like to offer you less salary, but more stock options&quot;. Ha ha ha, if I was that dumb, why would you want to hire me?<p>The problem is, there are too many things that can go wrong with stock options. The biggest, of course, is that most startups fail, and therefore most stock options have zero value. Or as Paul Graham once said, the median long-term value for any startup in any startup investment fund is $0 -- and that implies the median value of any startup stock option is $0.<p>The article lists many other things that can go wrong with stock options -- dilutions, side deals, etc.<p>I can think of some incentives that would actually motivate me. They would be expensive, but that is the point -- they would put real money in play, which would make them worse from the point of view of the company, but would make them real to me. They could then work as an actual incentive.<p>One such incentive would be for the company to agree to commit a percentage of gross revenue to the workers. Say, 2%, or 4%. Then lets say, for every dollar we are paid from our salary, we get 1 royalty point, and the gross revenue fund is divided up on the basis of how many royalty points we all have. As much as I laugh at the line &quot;We&#x27;d like to offer you less salary, but more stock options&quot;, if I seriously believed that a startup was going to do well, then hell yes I would take a salary cut now in exchange for a percent of a pot that is guaranteed to get a committed amount of gross revenue.<p>I&#x27;ll point out that Hollywood has been a trailblazer in this regard. It used to be an industry joke that actors were promised a percent of the &quot;profits&quot;, but then with creative accounting, even very successful films could be shown to lack any profits, and therefore nothing needed to be paid to the actors. Because of the unfairness of those deals, Hollywood has moved toward royalty payments that are increasingly based on something like gross revenue.",1450416828

10756810,comment,10756113,10756113,0,0,mirimir,,,"> Ten days later, a Mountain View motorcycle cop noticed traffic stacking up behind a Google car going 24 miles an hour in a busy 35 mph zone. He zoomed over and became the first officer to stop a robot car. He didn’t issue a ticket -- who would he give it to? -- but he warned the two engineers on board about creating a hazard.<p>> “The right thing would have been for this car to pull over, let the traffic go and then pull back on the roadway,” said Sergeant Saul Jaeger, head of the police department’s traffic-enforcement unit. “I like it when people err on the side of caution. But can something be too cautious? Yeah.”<p>I believe that this reflects the 25 mph maximum speed that Google has set. I don&#x27;t know CA law, but in some places it&#x27;s illegal to go under 25 mph in a 35 mph zone. It&#x27;s always safest to minimize speed difference with other vehicles. Even if that means exceeding the limit. That won&#x27;t protect against citations in speed traps, however.",1450416404

Quoting from <a href=""http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/nchrp_rpt_672.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/nchrp_rpt_672.pdf</a> :<p>> The initial design and construction cost of a roundabout can vary significantly depending on the roundabout size, right-of-way impacts, illumination requirements, and other design or aesthetic features that may be desired. A new single-lane roundabout intersection in an unbuilt environment can have construction costs comparable to a traffic signal. However, as the size of the roundabout increases, particularly in a fully built-out commercial or residential area, the cost of roundabout construction can be higher than that of a traffic signal, depending on the footprint of the roundabout relative to that needed for the signal. However, the ongoing operations and maintenance cost of a roundabout can be less than that for a signal, with the possible exception of increased illumination needs for a roundabout. Although the initial construction cost may be more, a roundabout can have less operating and maintenance costs than a traffic signal, and the service life of a roundabout is significantly longer, approximately 25 years, compared with 10 years for a typical signal (2). Roundabouts also provide substantial cost savings to society due to the reduction in crashes, particularly fatal and injury crashes, over their service life.<p>It also depends on how much you value people&#x27;s time waiting for a light to change, as described in the parent scenario.",1450416085

I suppose you can string together pipelines fine in other languages too, but I still think Go does a pretty good job keeping it simple (a couple of method definitions get you started) but clear on essentials (when things block, how errors look).<p>Anyhow, I&#x27;d really love to hear more about the connections back to Plan 9 from someone who knows about them.",1450415221

In reality it is the same as before: business as usual. What does it matter even if the device is truly encrypted? They&#x27;ve got all your info while you were using it anyway. This way the people they don&#x27;t want to have it can&#x27;t get it, but they still have it.<p>This debate about adding backdoors, this pretending to care that backdoors are added, is nothing more than an attempt to fool you and I that they don&#x27;t already have them!<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that if they win these fake debates they won&#x27;t also use such an opportunity to make illegal things like TOR and Freenet as they have made attempts to circumvent copyright protection illegal.

Yet, since they often require the programmer to sort of grasp a model of the thing the program is trying to accomplish, once you understand the operators (e.g. parser combinators) you have a rather deep understanding of the foundation for this particular program and the rest of the code is expressed very concisely and (sometimes) reasoned about easily.<p>Regarding the short variable names in math: They are supposed to be written and, more importantly, manipulated by hand and so short notation is very important.",1398840831

I&#x27;ve also seen (and met) many other top jugglers.<p>And yet, to be honest, while I appreciate the talent and skill required to do the kinds of numbers and moves Gatto does, and even though I understand the difficulty of pulling off, e.g., 7 clubs or 7-ball 5-up 360s or 6-club backcrosses — I find this type of juggling fairly boring to watch. No matter how much showmanship you put into it, every performing juggler eventually realizes that technical skill means very little and audiences get bored after about 3 minutes. Most good jugglers with long shows do comedy and variety routines. Gatto clearly didn&#x27;t want to go down that road. I respect that.<p>My favorite juggler to watch is Falco Scheffler: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CmnaICnMiw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CmnaICnMiw</a> — no high numbers here, just 3 and 4 balls.

7671926,comment,7671379,7671826,2,0,chas,,,"I think the key bit of the title is &quot;Algebra of Programs&quot;. This is a piece about being able to <i>calculate</i> programs. In section 12, Backus goes into some detail on how this construction makes algebraic reasoning easier and gives some specific examples. While it is not required to have a pure FP system to have a language that can be reasoned about algebraically, introducing arbitrary ad-hoc iteration will certainly destroy those algebraic properties.<p>I think this ties in well with Erik Meijer&#x27;s essay from a few days ago[1]. If you are trying to produce a framework for mathematical reasoning, it does not make sense to allow arbitrary exceptions. As a species, humans are pretty new to this whole computing thing, so I would agree we don&#x27;t have it figured out yet. However, over the last 5000 years or so we have developed a shockingly effective toolkit for reasoning about arbitrarily-defined abstract objects and I don&#x27;t think it is unreasonable to try to bring those tools to bear on a newer class of abstract object, that is to say programs. The cost of this is that we have to figure out how to formalize our ad-hoc methods. This will be painful, but every engineering discipline does it. In essence, formalized design methods applied to practical problems are the core of engineering practice in general. For example, I think software engineering right now is in the same place as electronic filter design was in the 1920&#x27;s. We have methods that work, given enough design effort, but our results are brittle and it is very difficult to make changes to working systems without introducing problems.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7654601"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7654601</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterworth_filter#Original_paper"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterworth_filter#Original_pap...</a><p>Note: I am blown away by Sussman&#x27;s talk every time I watch it, but I think throwing out math as a tool for understanding computing is very premature given its success as a tool for building and understanding abstraction, especially given that computing as a field started as an attempt to understand some deep questions about the foundations of mathematics.",1398840129
7671925,comment,7670521,7671039,2,0,bertil,,,"> What&#x27;s wrong with the IR implementation?<p>Not sure how that would work in practice, but I personally work with a cup of tea between my hands most of the time. That could interfere. Leap Motion was popular some time ago, and it detected the cup as such, not something bigger. I don’t know if they used IR though.<p>As you said, when interpreting non-obvious outputs of probes, several detection elements presumably help interpret issues: say pressure, conductivity for trackpads. I believe ‘Moves’ (the app recently bought by Facebook) use both the phone cell-tower signal to triangulate location <i>and</i> the motion to correct the occasional jump to the next neighbourhood when the nearest tower is suddenly busy.<p>For that ‘virtual trackpad’, using several frequencies or motion sensors might help; I’m not a big fan of your suggestion of a button: it seems… cumbersome, but it might actually work. I was made to realise today how I unconsciously used three- to four-button keystrokes most of the time.",1398840092

You have modeled sensors that tie in directly to the feedback loop controlling the device, and you have &quot;wtf happened ?&quot; sensors.<p>There are 2 big considerations:<p>1) simplicity of the sensors. Meaning how easy is it to use the output of the sensors to get to a useful model of the situation. Accelerometers, what you&#x27;d call &quot;sensors&quot; are somehwat easy (though nowhere near as easy as you&#x27;d suspect, read up on kalman filtering for a few of the considerations)<p>2) comprehensiveness of the sensor information. Meaning if you&#x27;ve got just the output of this sensor, how much do you know (after careful analysis). Accelerometers only give you one aspect, so they fail pretty badly.<p>Cameras are definitely comprehensive sensors. They are really good to understand afterwards exactly what happened. Not so easy to write control loops against.<p>The fun thing is that nature has diametrically chosen for comprehensive sensors, coupled to a nervous system that can learn extremely complex feedback loops. Feedback loops so complex that you&#x27;d have zero hope of ever modeling correctly in a lifetime. Humans move based on information from one eye (not even 2 eyes, but sometimes the left hemisphere controls the body based on information of the right eye, sometimes the right hemisphere controls based on information of the left eye).<p>Now if you look at the control tasks that nature can carry out, versus what we can do using technologically, we are pretty pathetic. Bats, for example, fly at 50-60km/h right through the leaves of bushes and trees in pursuit of insects in total darkness (using sonar) without impacting any of the branches, they locate insects on the other sides of branches or leaves without even looking, and they do this with thousands of interfering signals sent out by independant mobile platforms [1]. They can fly through a bush as if it&#x27;s not even there.<p>The limit of human technology when it comes to sonar are ultrasonic distance sensors [2] ... there&#x27;s no comparison.<p>So yes, technology uses sensors, but we really shouldn&#x27;t.

I don’t remember who first used the term ‘tier’ in this context, but I remember it back in 2000, possibly sooner with RUP to describe a multitier/n-tier application. This was a time of great debate online about the separation of concerns like data and security contracts of the newly developing web services… It had been mostly Cobra, DCOM and EJB’s up until this point.  But I digress…<p>A very basic N-Tier architecture could be looked at like this:<p>Data Tier: This was the area that the core data logic and rules around the domain specific knowledge were guarded--and different from all aspects of the system.  Like a phone company and their telephone number, as well as the number of minutes a particular telephone number is allowed, have specific requirements. The Data Model is where those types of requirements and rules are implemented.<p>Business Tier: Things like a father setting up time walled minutes on his daughter&#x27;s phone so she can&#x27;t talk on the phone at night... The data model would not allow even the business logic to set a negative number on the minutes; it would allow configuration of those domain model fields within proper bounds.<p>Presentation Tier:  To make it easier on the user, we&#x27;ll make the data entry screen telephone field on our external application format the input number to our specific carrier’s style:  xxx-xxx-xxxx.  The Business logic would handle events raised by the presentation tier and return a success message or possibly a failure message triggered from the business silo where the father hasn&#x27;t paid his bill so the family management aspect of the program will not work until he does. Today, this will most probably be a JavaScript app responding to an asynchronous message from an open source web socket server, but it used to be good old request/response.<p>There’s all manner of debate as to missing tiers, level of complexity per tier or any manner of versions of good architecture.  I&#x27;ve heard the database referred to as the Data Tier, when it was obvious the domain model rules require far more granularity and limitations than a simple database could provide.<p>However, from the above tiers, I think you can see where a M C V architecture begins to emerge from this separation of logic by the type of requirement it falls under.  Why it’s ordered: MVC always boggled me—but I’m sure Fowler (aka Captain Obvious) could give us a reason.<p>The idea did not develop, IMO, from a need to over complicate a simple task, but rather from the large scale factory production mentality of early software shops.  If you have the money for 20 developers for a very large project how can you separate their tasks by skill or experience so all their work will be countable like beans? Large engineering processes and tiered architectures, Business Analysts and Data Analysts, and even Architects and Silver tongued CEOs.<p>This was one of the uses of the whole front-end v/s back-end developer. I think this was a P.C. way of asking if you were an over glorified graphic designer with scripting skills or tier-minded.<p>Object oriented programming became appealing to some because with highly decoupled separation of concerns and fewer logical endpoints, abstractions could be applied.  Every ‘Controller’ could extend an abstract class which could bake in the functionality to log all requests and responses for auditing purposes. You could abstract the data tier so its server load could be managed independently. You could even abstract the logic of the business rules into a new language which could be the savior or large enterprise wide service deployments: BPEL and ESBs.<p>Let me wrap up:  In my opinion: MVC or MV* is a school of thought that has good use when one thinks in the context of the logical grouping of functionality by requirements and their type, with the ability to extend those types individually with functionality across their tier. ",1398837724

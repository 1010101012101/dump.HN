for adults. This is a very wrong notion that many of us 
have built over the years. Just like yoga benefits the 
mind, body and soul of an adult, it has the same impact 
on children. In fact children reap more benefits from 
yoga than adults. This is because their body will adapt 
to the routines of yoga as they grow and the practice 
of yoga continues with the years reaping extra

Fructose is the sugar he takes issue with, because it's much more common in products than it should be due to the body's limited ability to cope with it.  When he just calls it sugar, he's making it easier for people to relate with.<p>And yes, with him calling fructose a poison a large number of products available could be a serious issue if you eat too much of them.  Unfortunately, what constitutes ""too much"" is very little and fluctuates a bit depending on your rate of digestion which can be slowed by taking in more soluble fiber at the same time.<p>It's been added to products as a flavor compensation too liberally, because it's cheap, addictive, legal and increases sales.

Disclaimer: The definition of ""free software"" is up for debate. I'm not condoning Debian's definition. Just informing.<p>2. Every distribution has it's package managers that tweak the packages in the repositories in various ways. Iceweasel is just a slightly tweaked version of Firefox. It's not a completely different package. You have noticed this background play only because they changed the name but it's not in any way different from the way the package managers decide which version of Gimp they put in Stable and what features of such version are to be disabled by default for security reasons or otherwise.<p>3. Iceweasel is fundamentally the same as Firefox. Except it's usually a bit older and more stable and goes through more rigorous security testing and maintenance.

There's a fair share of drama and spectacle in every episode but much of what he does is apply the same fundamental changes to every restaurant. And it's not silver bullets, it's just sound execution of basic, common sense practices. Keep the menu simple, make stuff fresh, keep the kitchen clean, keep service timely, keep spending under control, etc.<p>If you have a product that has traction in the market it's not necessary to try for silver bullet features. It's only necessary to get your ducks in a row and execute well. Execution tends to be multiplicative along every aspect. If you can deliver solid features AND solid usability AND solid performance AND solid reliability AND solid customer service then there's no reason why you shouldn't do well.<p>Ultimately I think the search for silver bullets comes out of a sense of denial. People like to think that the reason their restaurant is doing poorly is some external problem they have no control over, rather than because they.

I rolled my own unit test framework before PHPUnit even existed. I was using DBG when xdebug was launched. I was patching PHP to use FPM long before it was in core. Believe you me, I am <i>entirely</i> too familiar with PHP and the ecosystem around it and I wouldn't go back in part because tools like xdebug really are <i>that bad</i> in comparison to what you get with something like Scala or .NET.<p>The problem is less the language, which is slippery and broken in interesting and different ways from version to version but generally not in ways that are real killers. The real problem is that those people that you say aren't professional developers (and they're not!) <i>and are considered important use cases</i>. This is a language where the core developers actually care about people who splat HTML in their PHP and vice versa. They're the people who don't even know about <i>mysql_real_escape_string</i> (LOL), let alone PDO or doctrine-dbal. And if those guys are just hanging on, great, more power to them, but the core PHP team actually cares about the use case for these people, while for the most part, they really <i>don't</i> seem to care about the use case for people who want to Do It Right. The distaste from guys like Rasmus toward the various framework projects is well-known and I kinda think it has an impact on the language itself.<p>This is I've seen as commonplace PHP development:<p>-Misuse of Mediawiki as a corporate intranet, using and extending scary plugins like template parser functions.<p>-Autogenerated CakePHP monstrosities that barely function and <i>doesn't</i> if you have to make significant changes.<p>-Home-rolled extensions to Drupal for that <i>one little thing</i> that SomeCo's website really just had to have. Ditto Wordpress, ditto Joomla.<p>Don't get me wrong: it is entirely possible to write good PHP. I'd say, with a decent bit of conviction, that the possibility of doing so goes down sublinearly with the amount of code/feature-points/other-measure-of-size and goes down superlinearly with the number of other people touching your code. But it's totally possible to do so. I wouldn't have used it for most of a decade if it wasn't. But I am entirely and completely convinced it is the sad minority, with the crazy majority largely catered to by the PHP development team, and it's a major reason why I've gone on to saner pastures.",1319575144

However, as current protests and riots in the West show, there is also a psychological element. Additionally, large portions of the world do not have that padding, and regression actually means physical pain (food shortages) rather than psychological pain. Large groups in that category are also nuclear-equipped (Russia, Pakistan, India and China) and so I guess your sine-wave of population gently dipping down from carrying capacity after briefly going over might actually be a very sharp movement downward, measured in the units of the nuclear age: megadeaths.[1]<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megadeath"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megadeath</a>",1319574420

Our product is about giving users a far better privacy policy, which is a piece of design, usability and information architecture. You can't achieve this without embedding.<p>Moreover, embedding is better because:\n- It's faster to integrate\n- No maintenance needed\n- The policy can be updated remotely (both by us and by the user)\n- The result is just beautiful, opens as a lightbox, has icons :)<p>There are also business-related reasons why embedding is better than template.<p>About the UI, the lags are caused by my development local machine, on the production server there's instant feedback on every action.

Cable companies pay $x/subscriber for a channel - each additional customer doesn't add to some cost multiplier and profit goes up with revenue and cost of content.<p>Netflix doesn't do that, though. There are no channels to speak of, so there is no middleman to negotiate with, there is only the content providers who see you as small peanuts when you're little and a looming, direct threat when you're big.<p>The way Netflix deals work (at least from what we can gather from public articles about the subject) is that Netflix pays a fixed cost for x streams of y content from z provider, with a time expiry for the overall deal. Once the collective user base has used up that streaming bucket or the time has expired, Netflix has to re-negotiate to fill it again.<p>In other words, in 2005 when Netflix only has 500k subscribers and online video is impossible to monitize, handing them a multi year exclusive deal with a 5 million streams for $100 million (pulling these numbers directly out of my ass, just to be clear) is no big deal, you just made $100 million on something that was formerly worthless, good for you.<p>However now it's the year 2011 when advertisers are paying better money for online ads, online viewing is exploding and eating into your traditional sources of revenue, and Netflix is riding their 2005-era deal all the way to the bank. Now letting them get away with that deal is viewed as tantamount to content theft in the eyes of the providers. Suddenly to secure the same deal you got for $100m, will now cost you $500m. Multiply that by every content provider in the industry, and you can plainly see why Netflix is stuck between a rock and a hard place right now.",1319573322

I figured, if CPU allowed, it'd be possible to create a video stream on-the-fly with whatever UI you'd want in it and push it to the AppleTV. (I'm no hardcore developer, so this never went much further than a theoretical dream)<p>Then Apple announced AirPlay Mirroring, which is pretty much what I was thinking with the advantage (I believe) that it's managed in big part through hardware, making CPU usage lower, thus doable. My Twitter stream is witness of my excitement about that.<p>I'm convinced that when games start to really take advantage of it, this will give Apple access to gaming in the living-room. And not only racing games, first-person shooters, etc. but board games, games  la TV-game show, etc. Having two screens, one being private, can lead to very interesting apps and games. For example, you can have Pictionary/Taboo-style games where one player has an iPod with some info, and the rest is shared on the TV. And you can also take advantage of other iOS devices nearby.<p>Now, I was not convinced about Apple going to the expense of building TVs when the AppleTV (box) already has much of the benefits of what I would think an Apple TV set would do. But Joe made some good points about improving the current TVs: no need for a remote to turn on/off, no need to switch inputs, possibility to improve the network connection with the devices (e.g. like AirDrop does with a dedicated channel between two Macs)<p>Finally, regarding his last line <i>""If I were an iOS developer, and I'd start investing in AirPlay right now.""</i>, my understanding is that it's actually very simple to implement: <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/AirPlayGuide/EnrichYourAppforAirPlay/EnrichYourAppforAirPlay.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011045-CH6-DontLinkElementID_7"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/Au...</a><p>You can get a notification of a second connected display and use that screen to build your UI in exactly the same way you would your main interface.

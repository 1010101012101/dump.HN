6475530,comment,6475062,6475357,2,0,IsaacL,,,"I agree, but it&#x27;s interesting to think about how you would handle such information programmatically. Even for a case where you let users input their own gender, it&#x27;s tricky.<p>Do you simply add some extra genders? Male-to-female transexual, female-to-male transexual, intersex? No matter how many categories you add, you&#x27;ll always annoy someone for missing them out. Does &#x27;genderqueer&#x27; and &#x27;genderfluid&#x27; count as the same category, or different ones?<p>Maybe just add a free text form for people to input their gender? But then it&#x27;s impossible to normalise if you want to do any analysis.<p>Maybe we should just be enlightened and ignore gender altogether? But sometimes knowing your user&#x27;s gender is really important, and it seems weird to discard this data because some people don&#x27;t fit. Maybe the best compromise is simply to have 3 categories - male/female/other - though even then you&#x27;ll get complaints. &quot;Who are you calling &#x27;other&#x27;?&quot;<p>Anyone have any other thoughts?<p>PS: I seem to see way more people in tech complaining about brogrammers than actual brogrammers.",1380628694

6475522,comment,6475202,6475455,13,0,barrkel,,,"8-byte mallocs are expensive because most mallocs have per-allocation memory overhead to track things. This is exactly why you may want to use a different allocator.<p>IOW, you&#x27;re angle is that instead of finding a solution to the problem, instead choose a different problem. You don&#x27;t always have that luxury.<p>My background on this problem is compilers. Compilers allocate lots of little structures that represent tree nodes, values, tokens, etc. Forcing them all to be a minimum of 32 or 64 bytes in size on the basis that would justify using malloc for them, would be more than a little bizarre. Arena allocation - both per module (for structures that need to persist for the whole compilation) and stack based (for structures that are discarded after e.g. evaluation or codegen) - makes far more sense than contorting the problem so that malloc makes sense.",1380628559

6475499,comment,6474197,6474945,5,0,vidarh,,,"The chances that my house will burn down is very very small. In the 8 years I&#x27;ve lived in it, only one house on my street of 660 houses have had a fire, and it did not totally ruin it.<p>But the small amount I pay in insurance is well worth it to avoid bankruptcy in the event it burns down and I&#x27;m on the hook for my mortgage plus rebuild costs.<p>The chances that I&#x27;ll die before my son is old enough to make his own living is likewise miniscule. Yet the life insurance payments are small compared to the peace of mind they give knowing he&#x27;ll at least not want for money.<p>The point of catastrophic insurances is not to break even - on the contrary: You should hope it&#x27;s a loss, because if it&#x27;s not it means something really bad has happened to you. Maybe the threshold for what constitutes a &quot;really bad&quot; financial blow is high for you, but for most people it is quite low.<p>You may consider it ok to run the risk of going bankrupt over relatively minor medical issues. I don&#x27;t.<p>And your bankruptcy example demonstrates the point of making this mandatory: Otherwise everyone ends up paying, without any ability to steer how the payment burden is distributed. This is likely to further disadvantage those who are least able to pay for their treatments in the first place.<p>I suspect that despite the shortcomings of ACA it&#x27;s going to turn out politically much like the UK NHS: When it was introduced, in 1948, the Conservatives fought it tooth and nail, and vowed to repeal it - one might have been forgiven for thinking it would be the End of Britain if one were to have listened to them. A year or two after it was introduced, the NHS had become so popular that they dropped their opposition to it with the realisation that they&#x27;d never form a government again if they kept up their opposition.<p>Chances are good that unless the ACA implementation is botched beyond belief that Republicans will find themselves in a similar situation in a few years, which might just explain why they are so rabid now.",1380628270

What do you think is uniquely interesting about this solution?&quot;<p>It remains to be seen if it&#x27;s uniquely interesting. If it <i>is</i> uniquely interesting, it will be because of node.js&#x27;s supposed ability to do well with distributed server type things.<p>It is my <i>general</i> opinion that node.JS gets overused for quite a lot of things that it has no business being used for. But one thing I would use it for is the high concurrency, small payload size stuff like instant messaging and MMORPG&#x27;s.<p>Imagining a robotics scenario, you could enable a simulated version of a swarm of robots that runs in a webpage.<p>with distributed sensors, you could integrate it with a web server set up using the same language- the sensors look just like some extra nodes in the distributed network. That could be nice.<p>The nice thing about javascript of course is that, all though it is kind of dumb out of the box, it is expressive enough that you can build some useful abstractions- and manage the callback hell that people tend to run into with node.js coded naively.<p>On the other hand it may well be making a fish climb a tree. Low level hardware stuff was never javascript&#x27;s strength. What could be interesting though is the higher level event driven stuff which is harder to achieve with things like c/java/arduino",1380627267

Accusing a service of lacking privacy (how do you know?) and fun (really?) and furthermore, failing to tell how <i>their</i> service is more private (and fun?) just is clumsy.<p>Newbie marketing tactics, too: In my experience, the companies that accuse competitors&#x27; products of sucking, and fail to show how their own products are better aren&#x27;t that great.<p>- How do they know Dropbox isn&#x27;t <i>fun</i> ? I find Dropbox great for what I want it to do.<p>- How do they know Dropbox isn&#x27;t secure? And claiming theirs is, how do we know it really is and not just a claim. In other words, if I were to ask folks at younited: What is Dropbox not doing that you are. Don&#x27;t give me &quot;not secure&quot; answers, get technical. If they don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s just defamation.<p>How do you measure privacy and security? Is there really anything <i>secure</i> ..

I uninstalled McAffee ages ago after seeing a pop-up saying &quot;total security&quot; or something like that.<p>How can you guarantee privacy and security, when there are back-doors in the hardware itself.

My annual healthcare expenditures are virtually zero, year after year, right now. Coverage in case of a heart attack or cancer would be awesome, because I can&#x27;t afford a $100,000+ hospital bill, but otherwise I rarely even have a cold or the flu.<p>I live in California which, as the first state to comply with ACA, has numbers available for me up at coveredca.com.<p>The bronze plan requires me to pay a 30% deductible for the category of &quot;High cost and infrequent care&quot;. So if I get cancer, my $200k bill (just to start, cancer treatment can go on and on) is still a $60k bill. I&#x27;m still bankrupt.<p>The Silver 87 plan also has a percentage-based deductible. Have to go up to the normal Silver plan to have a flat rate.

Well, I have, and let&#x27;s not pretend that Obamacare offers plain and simple catastrophic coverage because it doesn&#x27;t.  Look at the website and see for yourself.

If you want to see what it&#x27;s really like for nothing to work out of the box then head to the pre-Jenkins (then Hudson) era when CruiseControl was king (and I mean no disrespect to CC, it was a groundbreaking project).

As much as I support technology development and private space exploration efforts, I think that private companies shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to pollute the orbit without retribution.

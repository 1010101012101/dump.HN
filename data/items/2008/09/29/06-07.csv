Say you buy a $10 CD that pays 10% after 12 months.  Within that year, the dollar is devalued by 50%, but your CD still only pays out $11, even though you'd need $22 to have the same purchasing power.",1222671345

318164,comment,318059,318060,0,0,slater,,,"A few things: You position your app as a ""collaborative editor"", yet it took me almost two and a half minutes on the videocast to even get a look at it. I know you want to show how easy it is to sign up, but is that really necessary? You're not selling a sign-up/sign-in page, you're selling your service. Furthermore, if I were selling an app that does collaborative editing, I wouldn't harp on on the whole ""revision control system"" angle. It's redundant knowledge - I know it's there by seeing the amount of dates & times (and it's also briefly shown in the videocast), so I'll use it when I need it. See how Wikipedia does it: They don't go on and on about how each page has a ""History"". All that they do is put an ""edit"" button on each page or page section. Less in your face == much happier users.<p>Next, when I read the description, I was thinking of something like MS Word, online, with multiple people working on the same document, yet it comes across as an ajax-ified blog engine: ""Version 1 by Nick today at nn:nn pm"" isnt really information I need staring back at me at all times.<p>Some nit-picks: I would edit out the breathing-into-the-mic. No offense, but it's kinda grating :) And Charlie sounds kinda bored/indifferent...",1222670784

That's for an entire computer architecture. SPARC has also been displaced by MIPS on the high-end and PPC on the low end of ""pizza-box"" and network infrastructure, and the embedded market seems to belong to ARM.<p>Financials and WebSphere farms definitely do still run Solaris/SPARC, but plenty of huge financials have also transitioned to RHEL.",1222670136

I'm of European descent and I'm positive that for any given race/ancestry, you can find someone who is strictly smarter than I am (by any metric you want).<p>The point you're missing by interpreting our statements as personal attacks is that we're talking about group <i>mean</i> differences.  And the reason this is relevant is that for the past 40 years in the United States, inequality of outcome has been taken as evidence of inequality of opportunity (i.e., lower <i>average</i> African-American and Hispanic educational/economic achievement is evidence of discrimination by whites), thereby justifying affirmative action and other forms of income redistribution.  This is a perfectly reasonable conclusion if you assume that all races have an equal distribution of cognitive abilities.  What we're trying to say is that this assumption is unfounded.",1222670087

If yes, then Solaris (as we know it) probably is too.<p>Answer is probably only ""maybe"" at this stage.

Yeah the Tesla accelerates faster than most people will have ever experienced before and it's neat with its whole 1 gear thing, instant torque and of course being all electric. But it will be the laughing stock of any track day.<p>First off, as Wil pointed out, it doesn't like staying at 100mph+ for very long. That naturally makes it not a track friendly car. It will get passed up easily on the straightaways at some tracks (ex you can hit 140+ on the back straight at Road Atlanta). And the brakes will get roasted and it will run out of battery after just a few sessions. Not to mention that there's no fun in driving a car and not shifting gears and toying with the clutch, and of course being deafened by the loud sound of a free flowing V-8,10,12,whathaveyou<p>Okay, just my little rant. In summary the Tesla is not a car guy's car, it's a SV show-off car.",1222669857

318144,comment,317549,317765,0,0,asdf333,,,"I agree w/ your point except the part about trading being a value-added activity. Liquidity, if you ask Warren Buffett, is overrated.<p>When people trade AAPL, for example, there is a loser and a winner. The real value is not created by those trading AAPL it is created by Steve Jobs and those working at AAPL. While trading is not zero-sum, it is a mostly zero-sum activity.<p>You might say. AIG may beg to differ, since it went under for liquidity, rather than solvency reasons. However if you don't employ dangerous amounts of leverage, it is not an issue. There are plenty of insurance companies in business who didn't dance too close to the edge like AIG did.",1222668660

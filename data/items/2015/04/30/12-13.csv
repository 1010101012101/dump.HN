9464738,comment,9463254,9464479,0,0,ufo,,,"Static typing helps catch bugs and code refactoring. For example, if you add a parameter to a function in ML the compiler will point out for you all the call sites that need to be updated to the new API. The compiler will also be smart enough to notice the times when your function is called via aliases, which is something you can&#x27;t do via textual find-and-replace.<p>The need for type inference is because in languages with more advanced type systems like ML it would be very annoying if you had to write down the types for everything by hand with no assistance from the compiler.<p>>  As I understand this - I&#x27;m probably wrong but - dynamically type == type inference.<p>No, this is only a common misconception. The better analogy is &quot;dynamically typed&quot; == &quot;everything belongs to a single type&quot;.<p>In Python every value has a type of &quot;object&quot; and can be passed to anywhere you want. The interpreter adds tags to the memory representation of the objects so it knows what to do with them and it raises a runtime error if you try to use a value in the wrong place (for example, when you try to call a method on None).<p>On the other hand, in a language with a sound type system you have a guarantee that there will never be type errors at runtime (&quot;well typed programs do not go wrong&quot;). The type checker enforces that different types never get mixed together, which also removes the need for runtime tags in the memory representation.",1430398699

Highly qualified, more than happy to assist with tasks that aren&#x27;t to do with their product and they really care about the overall project outcomes.<p>Open source has forced vendors to make sure that every project that uses their products are a success.<p>> On the other hand, commercial software is often designed by committee, written in cube farms and developed without proper guidance or inspiration<p>Again more nonsense.

The Mercator projection is <i>conformal</i>. What this means is that angles (and hence in some sense shapes) are preserved locally. When we zoom in on a small section of the Mercator projection, we get a reasonably accurate representation of the actual shape of features. This is generally not true for most more fashionable projections, which will stretch and skew things, so they don&#x27;t always look great when zoomed.<p>In general with map projections, you have to make a compromise between global properties and local properties. Choosing Mercator means going full-on for local quality, at the expense of the global map being quite distorted. This makes it great for zoomable web maps, because most of the time the global map is just used to find the area you&#x27;re actually looking for.<p>Now, you could argue that for a living-room wall, you want something that looks good globally. If it was my wall, I&#x27;d agree with you. However, this guy seems to be really interested in local detail. He worries about his four-point fonts becoming blurry, and about having as many small villages marked on the map as possible. If he&#x27;s interested in that kind of detail, then I think he probably cares far more about local properties than the kind of global properties that would bother me or you.",1430398515

I was a master of PowerPoint, Excel and burn-down charts.  Through some re-orgs I moved into management and stopped PM&#x27;ing projects.  Very different role than developer or architect, still no daily effort on building things, but managing others that do so a little more rewarding than PM. Not much difference in pay and looking upwards at middle-management makes me shudder.<p>Now I am at a crossroads (the other side of yours), at 40, where applying for senior developer or technical roles probably puts me somewhere in the middle of the stack of resumes.  I haven&#x27;t been coding as a full time gig for a while.  Not trying to blather on about myself but think about 10 years from now what you would like to be doing.  If you think you can be a PM or manager that is better than your current (&quot;I&#x27;ll be the PM that does it right&quot;), understand that there are often complex constraints those roles are put under to deliver things.<p>Try to take a step back and look at the big picture.  In a software development career there are going to be technology and process fads that come and go with entire industries associated with them (often selling to your management a box of silver bullets to ease their pain).  Sure there are going to be stupid processes you have to follow - that is everywhere and probably for every career as well.<p>Comply with the coding standards and processes as you build stuff, you&#x27;ll see they will change over time but in a way they really don&#x27;t change.  Daily stand-ups, weekly status reports, TDD, waterfall, Xtreme Programming, pair programming, curly-brace police, etc.<p>Do you love creating things with software?

By going that route you&#x27;re committing to spending a lot of time and money on a lot of hairy merging.<p>Second, for most serious companies the open source libraries they rely on are not a part of their secret sauce.  You&#x27;re really not maintaining a whole lot of competitive advantage by closely holding that tweak to MySQL&#x27;s query optimizer that lets your social office supply reviewing site respond to requests with 1% lower latency.  Unless fractionally shorter response times is really what your company has going for it, of course. In which case it&#x27;s probably doomed anyway.<p>I think these two factors in concert mean that it&#x27;s generally much better for a business to contribute back than to try and maintain an internal fork.<p>Of course, businesses only contribute back to projects that they&#x27;ve decided to use in the first place.  Using GPL code for your SASS product probably won&#x27;t cause any immediate problems.

The issue is not what MS can do to <i>Arduino</i>, but what MS can do that causes trouble for people on other OS platforms.<p>I&#x27;m not proposing that this is an MS strategy, but that sort of thing is not unprecedented in MS&#x27; past, so it&#x27;s not unreasonable that some might be skeptical of MS&#x27; intentions.

A freely available bootloader, and a barely-passable IDE (that runs on any platform) are the two things that set Arduino apart from all of the other similarly capable kits that came before it. If you appreciate the bootloader, you might consider paying the &quot;&#x27;official&#x27; Arduino markup&quot; at least once.<p>>You could even go barebones and learn to code for AVR chips without Arduino getting in the way (it&#x27;s cheaper and leaner).<p>You could, but it&#x27;s not cheaper, since you&#x27;ll need an AVRISP, or something similar, you&#x27;ll also need to spend a lot of time learning about microprocessor minutiae before you ever get to anything interesting.<p>No, worst case is more like Arduino focuses on MSVS interoperability and sort of abandons the cross-platform IDE; but it wouldn&#x27;t make much difference now anyway.

Defintely not.<p>Levine&#x27;s (linked) comment that OSS companies can&#x27;t execute on Product Management is incredibly short sighted, if done correctly, they have infinitely <i>more</i> data than their proprietary counterparts.  But later on he seems to be saying that there can&#x27;t be another people keeping it as &quot;pure&quot; ... well, no, Red Hat isn&#x27;t really a product company.  I&#x27;ll get to that.<p>The first article itself doesn&#x27;t seem to know what Red Hat <i>really</i> is either, saying &quot;Red Hat has become a technology sommelier that selects the best of open source infrastructure and development software and organizes it into packages to solve enduring problems for enterprise computing.&quot;.  It&#x27;s more about support of base OS.  Really.  All the packaging stuff makes that possible, but the various products that Red Hat buys and sells are tiny in comparison.<p>Whether we like it or not, if you are building building-block software the expectation is now that these components be OSS.  Proprietary software is generally viewed as acceptable in SaaS apps and end-user products, but is growing less acceptable in application substrates, programming languages, and the like.<p>Red Hat is doing well because of a lot of big (read: bank)  customers needing expertise on kernel/hardware related issues, other companies will likely grow differently.<p>If people are asking for &quot;another&quot; Red Hat, what do they want?  It&#x27;s really a meaningless phrase in a way.  I don&#x27;t think they want Red Hat&#x27;s various ancillary products, I think they mean something with the teeth of an operating system company.<p>Red Hat is great, and in many ways still is.  There are many more interesting things to do instead.  The comparison of thing-that-is-a-company-but-not-in-the-same-space with Red Hat is typical VC meaningless-ness question.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s asking &quot;can something get so big without being an OS company&quot;.  I think it can, because the OS is largely a solved problem, and there is lots to be done is going to appear on top of it - but I&#x27;d also rather companies didn&#x27;t try to get that big, and just concentrate on making one or two awesome things, and there being lots of awesome things.",1430396074

EDM music also has a build up - the beat generally starts simple and gets more complex as the track progresses. Sometimes, thats called the drop, right? When a track builds up, they &quot;drop the beat&quot; and the best gets more complex, as found in Dubstep.<p>So, I think compression like that might work in software they use to write / develop a track; if the software can determine that 2 notes or beats are identical, it could code the file with less data in it, but I think of music to be similar to water. It&#x27;s fluid, with each note / beat / voice effecting the notes / beats around it. Ever listen to a track with the voice removed? Or with the drums removed?

Let me try again to put it more clearly.<p>First, they should lose their office for abusing its privileges. This has nothing to do with the fact that they violated, or worked against the constitution specifically, but that they violated the oaths of their offices, which happen to preclude that.<p>Secondly, the punishment does not require newly introduced &#x27;ex post facto&#x27; laws, as you seem to be implying, but should be in keeping with the facilitation of the violation of actual existing laws, which prevented the unconstitutional actions from taken place before the new laws were passed.<p>In other words, a politician that facilitates a law that unconstitutionally provides exceptions to previous existing laws, should be liable as an accessory to the crimes specified by that pre-existing law.<p>As far as determing their complicity is concerned, I believe that the fact that most everything is on record makes that fairly trivial.",1430395598

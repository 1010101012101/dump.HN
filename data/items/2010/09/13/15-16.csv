Once the words start coming out, one follows the other, and you'll likely end up saying something you didn't want or need to.  If your policy is to maintain silence except for the most basic interactions, then accidental self-incrimination is much less likely.",1284393579

1686928,comment,1685697,1686580,0,0,elblanco,,,"This is probably my last response to you and I'm trying to say this without coming across as mean.<p>First off, there are no serious claims anywhere that TDS misrepresents itself when filming interviews. People here have asked for citations of your claim several times and you've failed to respond. Please stop regurgitating nonsense. This isn't the place for it.<p>While I enjoy your willingness to engage on some level, and not immediately degenerate <i>every</i> posting into a Godwin's law violation, you really have a terrible awful lot to learn. I don't mean this in a ""if only you knew more about the brilliance of leftist politics, the truth would become obvious"" sort of way. I mean this completely apolitically. You actually seem to be completely unawares what political parody, satire, irony, sarcasm and comedy is, its history and how it works. The audience of TDS <i>does</i> know. You are clearly not the audience.<p>The Daily show has been broadcast in the U.S. for almost 15 years on a channel exclusively devoted to broadcasting comedy programming, it's one of the most popular and well known shows in America. It's commonly rebroadcast on the Internet, on other stations and other programs. Its host, Stewart appears often on popular competing and opposing shows. It's commonly derided by right-leaning talkshow hosts, news programs and commentary shows. It makes no claims to be a news show, unbiased or otherwise. Stewart himself has said on many occasions that he and the show are clearly left-leaning but make a concerted effort to make fun of all-sides. Despite their admitted left-lean, the show has gained a strong reputation among the right-leaning people as a place where they can have a fair conversation during the table-talk guest interviews. Every episode is available online, and youtube is practically clogged with TDS clips. It's won dozens upon dozens of major awards (I don't mean this as a point of legitimacy, but as a point of notoriety). It's well known in most English speaking countries and many non-English speaking countries. They even put this up at the beginning of every episode: <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f9/TDSglobal.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f9/TDSglobal.png</a>. In other words, what it is, and what it serves is well and widely known by anybody who has ever watched it.<p>Stewart himself says of how they target the show, ""Our show would not be valuable to people who didn't understand the news because it wouldn't make sense,"" he argues. ""We make assumptions about your level of knowledge that... if we were your only source of news, you would just watch our show and think, 'I don't know what's happening.'""<p>Again, I'm not saying this to be mean spirited, but you are clearly not somebody who they are targeting for their audience. In order to understand the show, you have to be well informed about current events, people in the news, politics, who the major players are, and understand parody, satire, sarcasm, irony and comedy. You clearly don't fit into this mold and that's okay. I don't get the work of Mark Rothko, I'm clearly not the intended audience of his work either.<p>Your objection is that TDS is not an apolitical objective news program doesn't make any sense because you don't know and understand the things you have to know and understand to ""get it"", it's like complaining that my car is not a helicopter.",1284392876

But for any reasonably complex or powerful product, there's a market of customers that are overserved by it and would pay less for less if they could.  This is usually handled by product segmentation - think of options in cars.  If you don't need the extra power, go for the 4-cylinder instead of the V-6.  If cash is more important than comfort, skip the leather seats.  If you need the fastest, most luxurious car and money isn't an option, check every box on the list.",1284392822

You seem to see the small tests as requiring cramming, and that the results from them hang over you.  You seem to see them as boxing you in, converting you to a number.<p>That's not how it's supposed to go.<p>The point is not to have the tests arising from the culture of the large, life determining tests.  The point is to have small, fast, fun tests where it's possible to get an answer wrong <i>and not care.</i>  It should be possible to try something off-the-wall in a test, and should it work you get a reward, and if it doesn't work it doesn't really matter.  Do it differently next time.<p>All the points you make are valid, but I think they are still to one side of the intention of the article, and other discussions.  I agree entirely that pure ""teaching to the test"" and ""the one true answer - or else"" are deeply destructive to the attitudes that are more creative, inventive, and possible more useful in the real world.  But I don't think that's the point.<p>There's a shed-load of stuff for kids to learn, and while exploratory, enabled learning can be effective, it can also be patchy and slow.  It can be deep, but it often isn't wide, and it doesn't serve all children equally well.<p>And to some extent, that's the point.  No single system fits every teacher-student pair, and yet that's what people tend to end up with.  Teachers are forced to follow the latest fad, even if it doesn't suit their style.  Children are exposed to current ""best practice"" with little of no feedback.<p>It's the feedback that counts.<p>If tests are normal, fun, expected and <i>de rigueur</i> then the kids get less stressed, and the teachers get more feedback about their understanding and abilities.  Then the best teachers can adapt their presentation to the kids.<p>It's a tool, a technique, an option.  It's not a silver bullet.  But it's also not what you are arguing against.  You are making valid, but different, points.",1284391082

But I did want to share my experience about the payout question.<p>So I was making $85K a year as a project manager/developer.  I went to work in a contract period for a startup who, if I had gone full time, would have offered around $65K to me as well as much worse benefits.<p>That would have included a certain number of shares.  The founder gave me his expectation as to what would be a low, medium or high exit.  Based on that I would have made between a couple thousand dollars and, at most, $100K.  Now, I would have to work at the startup for 4 years to fully vest, meaning I would have lost $20K per year in salary.  This means even if had a large exit and I made $100K, it would still just be a little over what I had lost in salary.<p>After a couple of months there, I went to work at another ""regular job"" and made $100K per year, which means it would have been a loss no matter what.  Now I still work making good money and am working on my startup on the side.  Since the startup-people were expected to put in significantly more than 40 hours a week anyways, I'm probably just working about the same amount of time and making way more money AND controlling my own destiny with a startup I am personally passionate about.",1284390668

Probably another overlooked factor is the size of the HDL particles. Or it could be, as some people argue, that HDL is just a marker and so affecting HDL directly won't change your health.<p>Torcetrapib is complicated as a CETP inhibitor. The drug didn't just inhibit the conversion of HDL to LDL (which means it didn't just boost HDL, but it also lowered LDL), it also inhibits reverse cholesterol transport (where CETP is involved). Patients on torcetrapib had weird distortions in a number of blood values, increased blood pressure, and other effects. Which was the cause of increased mortality? It's too early to know, although it's pretty clear that CETP inhibitors are a bad idea.<p>My point was more that we have more than just correlations that people who drink alcohol have lower mortality and cardiovascular risk (observational studies often turn out to be misleading), we also have some somewhat plausible mechanisms for why this would be the case. It'll definitely be a long while before we can actually know whether or not alcohol has net positive or negative affects.",1284390558

    $foo = $o->foo;
    $foo();<p>Using __get/__set behaves the same way. Let's say $o is of SomeType that defines those magic methods. You can have a function foo on that type that is defined as a public method.<p><pre><code>    $o->foo(); // the actual instance method
    $o->foo = function() { print 'bar'; };
    $o->foo(); // same instance method
    $foo = $o->foo;
    $foo(); // prints bar
</code></pre>
In the case of StdClass it might be possible to do it your way where foo could be callable ($o->foo()) but I can see why they wouldn't allow this in order to keep things consistent.<p>Edit: It also behaves the same way if you assign a function to a public field of a class (I'm using 5.4) so I actually support not allowing a method to be directly callable in this fashion because this would be the only case where this behavior would occur.",1362772781

There might be a fine line where a color scheme is used in such a way where it can be construed as plagiarism or maybe the icons were recreated from scratch to look exactly like LayerVault's but still preserving plausible deniability and those cases I <i>might</i> be able to get behind Layervault being upset. I liken it to Queen suing Vanilla Ice for using their riff in 'Ice Ice Baby' or how that one One Direction song sounds almost exactly like the Clash song whose name escapes me right now. In those cases it's just plain obvious the artist was trying to sample someone else's music but changed the riff just enough to be able to call it their own.

Compare this to the launch of The Burning Crusade expansion pack -- it was a rough launch! -- but over time, they managed to smooth their systems out such that now, even a content launch as huge as Mists of Pandaria went smoothly.<p>WoW is a different game, but it illustrates their iterative healing process.

Prietz reaches out to Judge Wright, filing a document that more or less directly accuses Prenda of fraud. Prenda replies to the filing by addressing ancillary issues in it without rebutting the core allegation. Judge Wright notices, and brings down the righteous legal hammer of a vengeful god down on Prenda, ordering them to his courtroom next week in person to either cough up a real Alan Cooper and a very compelling explanation of what they're up to or potentially face immediate incarceration.<p>I'm leaving out all sorts of fun details here, which is all the more reason you should be reading Popehat. For starters, you really need to dig into Popehat to see how one of Prenda's outside counsels explained the business relationship between the porn-video shell companies and Prenda itself.<p><i>[PS]</i><p>A big problem with Popehat <i>vis a vis</i> HN is that the blog titles are never congenial to this site, and the ethos on HN is now ""don't mess with the titles"".

The existence of a common ancestor means that we went through a bottleneck.<p>Imagine that tomorrow all the males in this planet become sterile or die, all but one. If this guy manages to reproduce (well, what would be the odds he wouldn't?), in a relatively short term the human population will raise again.<p>If you sample the population you will find that they all have something similar, because they all descend from a single male, and apparently it's possible put also a date to that event.<p>Does this mean that tomorrow is the start of a new humankind? That we are not the same humans as the children of this guy?<p>Of course not. Neither TFA says that the father of humankind's father wasn't human (i.e. that we found genetic proof of Adam)<p>My argument is that if you hold some kind of beliefs, you tend to be less critical about stuff and jump to wrong conclusions, even assuming complete lack of malice.<p>I think it's a very human behavior.

Even in California, where anti-moonlighting clauses are very difficult to enforce, there are circumstances (conflict-of-interest being an important one) where you can't work two jobs. In many other states, <i>all</i> anti-moonlighting clauses are considered ""reasonable"" restrictions on your right to work.<p>Sorry for the stridency, but the logic that carries you to that conclusion is dangerously faulty. The law simply doesn't see most employment, by default, as an exchange of a set number of hours for a set amount of money. The enforceable parts of your contract can make the situation far more complicated than that. For examples, see: intellectual property and trade secrets, noncompetition, conflict of interest, overtime for salaried exempt employees, anti-moonlighting, accidentally representing your company on Twitter, and so on.<p>This stuff is <i>very</i> relevant to startups, as it's an easy way to torpedo yourself before you even pick a name for the company.",1299527967

All jobs that don't directly support the necessities of life, are either directly selling products to consumers or supporting companies directly selling products to consumers. There still has to be a mass of people to sell crap to for the economy to function.

Even after you click the delta to find its absolute count, it's difficult to interpret it (to me). Place a green dot at the end of the chart and a red at the start and then color code two numbers to correspond. It'll give a sense of scale and variation that's currently missing. It'll also immediately suggest a linear model for followers over the last X days which might be a good summary for some names.<p>I'm not sure what to draw from the scale-independent representation you've got right now since I can't tell if wide swings in the sparkline indicate something really changed in way people follow that name or if it's just noise. This is a perfect opportunity for some sort of random process model which could be used to suggest that certain spikes (such as the recent one for @reddit) are maybe more interesting that real random variation.<p>I'd also look for ways to investigate and highlight weird behaviors like @greplin's bimodalism. That a pretty huge.<p>I'm not sure I understand how the expanded interface matches to the sparklines, actually. Posterous' doesn't match up with the sparkline much at all that I can see. Are you doing linear detrending?<p>I suppose as always there's no magic bullet for information presentation. There are any number of questions I think you could ask of a data set like this (stability, relative growth, comparison with other metrics like investment or publicity, looking for spikes).<p>I imagine that comparing each different company against the others would probably be not terribly useful since they're all at different scales, but I'd be very interested in things like how well data from one source could be predicted from all the others (which just starts out as computing correlation between them all) which might help you to separate out whole market trends from successes from each particular company.<p>The Tuftean method, which I support, still desires a complete, untransformed view of the raw data. So don't remove the sparklines. Just make them more interpretable by giving scale to the shape using further real data. Any of these cross-company models can potentially be added as additional information to the sparklines. Charts remain interesting and interpretable so long as they're drawn mostly in data-ink and are hierarchically readable.",1299527543

Whereas in languages such as Python and JavaScript, the implementation of this ""pattern"" makes them optional. You don't have to use accessors if you don't need them right now, since you can always go back and create them later without affecting client libraries.<p>What the article shows is that, surprisingly, JavaScript's native feature to do this is actually slower than the Java way (what the author called old-fashioned).

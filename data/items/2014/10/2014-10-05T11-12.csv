The iPhone was released in 2007, that was 7 years ago.<p>Every air device carries gyros inside, but for controlling the plane they had to give you a digital signal, it is not enough with the artificial horizon sphere.<p>The simple helicopter design has been mass produced for decades(and wars like Vietnam subsidized them more), and it is well tested and reliable. Any new design has to compete in price and will have to iron lots of bugs at first.<p>The second most important reason is that you need to use electric motors as normal heat engines could not respond as fast as needed.<p>So in order to make a quadcopter you need to generate electricity onboard, which means a big hybrid engine.<p>I see quadcopters as the future, but in order to compete in price, they will have to evolve from small UAVs.",1412509718

But I when I work I have two WQHD monitors (2560x1440) with one turned on its side so I have one text editor with a vertical resolution of 2560.  When ever I work on a laptop, even an HD laptop, I miss this setup so much as it feels like I am drinking through a straw.<p>Because of this I am unsure if VR, which is going to be much less than what I am working with now, is going to be a serious replacement.",1412507696

8411973,comment,8411254,8411687,0,0,Dn_Ab,,,"As others have mentioned, when the assumptions of conditional independence are met, Gaussian NaiveBayes and MaxEnt will asymptotically learn the same classifier. Except NB will learn it in O(log dimensions) instead of O(dimensions) examples. So in those cases and where you have fewer examples you&#x27;ll want to use NB.<p>Even when the independence assumptions are not met, NB will often produce a good classifier if you don&#x27;t care about the accuracy of the probabilities. NB is also online, resistant to the curse of dimensionality and for categorical data will learn polynomial decision boundaries. So the gain in the trade-off is in ease of implementation (you can write one in a dozen lines or less) that you can throw something close to your raw data at and often get good enough results without any ahead of time training, kernels or regularization.<p>You are right though that MaxEnt (some sparsity capturing algorithms are as powerful as SVMs) will in general outperform naive bayes and that the averaged perceptron probably has, <i>on average</i>, the best performance/ease of implementation ratio. But for many implementors/problems, where clarity is paramount, those distinctions will not be worth the cost.<p>Also, you have a wonderful website.",1412506852

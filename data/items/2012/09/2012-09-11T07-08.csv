4504301,comment,4503927,4504218,8,0,liedra,,,"Having tried to use Open/Libre Office as a MS Office replacement I can say it's definitely not on par with MS Office (sadly). So many little things that you take for granted on MS Office either aren't implemented or are incompatible with others who are using MS Office. For collaborative documents in an academic setting, using track changes, extensive bibliographies, stupidly large wordcounts etc., it's far, far easier to just use MS Office. I'd love to move these people on to google docs or something but old habits die hard in academia - emailed word documents is still where it's at.<p>As for Outlook - while I've set up my home computer to not use it, for most it's just easier to use it. Convenience has a lot going for it. For non-tech-savvy people it's also a lot easier, since then calls to tech support at work will actually get you help. :)",1347350328

An example of a goal is ""acquire 30 new customers by the end of the month"" and the relevant performance metric there would be ""number of new customers acquired."" Better performance in that case might mean 50 customers acquired while worse performance might mean 10 customers acquired.<p>I agree that ""it's easy to get frustrated if you bite off more than you can chew - so content yourself with learning simpler things at first."" I don't think that's contradictory to what I wrote; one component of good goals is that they're achievable. In retrospect I can see how you would read that lesson into Dan's post, but what he actually wrote is that what you should do if you want to ""build skill in the long term"" is ""setting firm goals and keeping track of what you're doing is a problem for beginners."" I think that is not appropriate advice for most people.",1347350181

Unfortunately, because technology (or, I suppose, the protocols that power it) tends to mask that, most people just make incorrect assumptions.<p>No, people should not have to make these assumptions or do research into this. That's why it's important for us to design secure tools. Users assume stuff is secure, so it's our duty to ensure their assumptions are true.

4504291,comment,4502183,4503248,2,0,a45l98,,,"The other thing to consider is that audio processing is resource intensive.  Many times you need to run many things at once and performance suffers.<p>Guess what else is resource intensive?  Graphics.  So everytime you have gratuitous graphics (e.g. a guitar plug-in that has one or two controls but goes to ridiculous lengths to reproduce a graphical image of, say, a guitar pedal), it takes away some of your resources.<p>I think you're right though.  The interface is aimed at people who are used to looking at gear.  That is the intended audience.  They wanted to sell to the same people who were buying physical gear.  Unfortunately it alienates anyone who understands how to actually use a computer beyond pointing and clicking or keyboard shortcuts.<p>I mentioned it in another comment in this thread, but if you want to see how things could be done in a ""UNIX way"", check out snd from the guys at Stanford CCRMA.  It has a long history, longer than Ableton, probably as old as Sound Designer, the precursor to Pro Tools, though I'd have to check the dates.  These guys clearly ""get it"".

4504285,comment,4502272,4503742,2,0,malvosenior,,,"I've been spending a lot of time thinking about where this is going and how we can accelerate the outcome (again speaking as a high level manager). The problem seems to come from access to capital. I've never seen an executive who adds ""10x"" value in terms of what they actually can produce through ""work"", instead what you find are 10x executives who create value through their ability to literally increase company valuation 10 times via their connections and network. Their network unfortunately will be founded on structural advantages they've gained from society (rich parents mostly). The right rich guy will get your company sold for millions of dollars more than an engineer can because his friends will be doing the acquisition. It has NOTHING to do with the actual value being created by the company.<p>As for middle management, they are a resource that should be subordinated to the engineers and other high value producing individual contributors. Non-creative work needs to suit the needs of the creatives not vice versa.<p>So, how to get around executive domination? Lowered costs to deploy technology is a great first step. When you can launch your product on ec2 and get going for an order of magnitude less money than was possibly 10 years ago, then you don't really need to raise millions of dollars (which by the way would be spent by the MBA types trying to attract top talent anyway). If you are top talent, run with it. Avoid ANYONE who isn't going to be producing value for you and your vision. Avoid the cult of VCs. Tech talent needs to take ownership of the success narrative and not give in to temptation to bring execs and vcs on board regardless of the capital boost they may provide. In the end they will make your product worse 100% of the time.",1347349901

TI used to have a typical 'hire and fire' reputation, which actually is what allowed it to perform these shifts - going so far as to abandon relatively new and incredibly expensive fabs and their workforces when needed.

Remember, the damage was three quarters of the way up the building, not at the foundation.<p>I'm no demolitions expert nor am I a physics major, so I can't speak as to how structures of that size behave under those conditions - though I'm sure the conspiracies have been thoroughly debunked by now.

A better anology would be night-vision goggles. You can ""see"" a lot better with PS.  In the same way you can ""see"" better with amplified starlight.<p>The last paragraph sort of says: ""You are either wrong or trivially true. If you are trivially true, I agree with you.""<p><i>If, on the other hand, you are not implying that the wool is being pulled over our eyes and are only stating that the Proudin-Gorsky images have been rendered in a a modern style rather than in a Technicolor or Kodachrome style or in the style that you would have seen if you were to have seen Proudkin-Gorsky project them with his lanterns, then point taken.</i><p>Again, your premise is wrong. The information content is <i>higher</i>. As established above. So, this breaks down the next part of your argument, too: that PS is like film. Again, film is what I put <i>into</i> the starlight scope. What comes out has amplified latent information.<p>This leaves what I'm saying as something else altogether and hopefully at once clearer and more agreeable. Lets call this the ""enhanced information hypothesis"". This is how you get your HD.<p>So where does that leave us? I think two things follow.  One, it explains why people react to these images and remark about their information content and their contemporary feel. Contemporary images have more (color) information in them, and the structure of this information is often unique.  But, because its unique (to the present) it is incongrous with the past. The way I would put this is it may help us <i>visualize</i> the past.  But I'm not sure it <i>brings us any closer</i> to the past.  That is, in sense of shared experience with the people of the past. They would have had a cool thing with their ""lanterns"".  But we are sort of looking at another ball game.<p>Again, There are gradations, etc to this way of putting it. Nothing is absolute. But I think its directionally correct.  Its important enough to take note of, and not to dismiss. It also steers well clear of making any leaps onto further implications about XYZ (veracity, accuracy, etc) which are at once imprecise and unncessary; not relevant to my points but areas of concern you have expressed.",1347347990

    Datomic separates the handling of transaction processing and
    query/read, it can make independent choices for each
    facility. Transactions favor consistency over availability, and the
    loss of a transactor will require traditional failover
    approaches. Queries and reads, however, are serviced by the highly
    available, replicated and scalable infrastructure of DynamoDB. And,
    since the data segments stored by Datomic in Dynamo are immutable,
    they are always consistent. Thus, Datomic is well suited for
    applications that require write consistency and read scalability.

So the common reason not to give an option of Linux (or no OS) is not because Linux is really lacking in functionality, but because of either deals with MS (i.e. reduced Windows price), or because of lack of demand (i.e. the same ""network effect""). But demand is hard to build if such option doesn't even exist as an option for an unaware customer. So it's a vicious cycle, which is of course well fed by MS to persist.",1347347320

For someone to choose Rebirth over the actual hardware, they likely do not own the hardware (for those actually bothering to read this, software doesn't sound quite like 20-year-old hardware, especially in this example). Therefore, there was little reason to mimic the odd limitations of the originals unrelated to sound or performance. The UI could have been more...I can't think of the word but ""homunculus"" comes to mind, that is, the knobs and interactive elements could have been larger, while retaining the visual aesthetic of the originals.  The 303 could have benefitted (as with modern CPU upgrades to it) live note editing. Things like that. Maintaining weird, frustrating aspects of the originals, for the sake of appealing to people who probably never owned them, would be my #1 criticism.",1347346905

The long name follows from that complexity.

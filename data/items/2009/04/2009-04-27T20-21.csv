Just because people were slow to take to the web doesn't mean that anything people are slow to take to will be the next web.<p>First, I didn't like the tone of the article. My kneejerk reaction was ""Don't tell me what I have to do"". Secondly, I'd like to see some real analysis behind the statements. For example I keep hearing about Zappos, and twitter and what not, but I have been buying from Zappos for years because they have a large selection, fair prices, good photos and <i>free fedex shipping both ways</i>. I couldn't care less what they twitter about.<p>As to customer reviews, that is appropriate at the retail end. I am not going to go to Sennheiser's web site and look for headphone reviews. I am going to go to Amazon (did I mention how much I like free shipping both ways?) and read the reviews there. So browbeating Sennheiser into a blog, customer reviews and a twitter feed isn't going to make me more likely to buy their headphones. Reviews on Amazon saying ""most confortable headphones I have ever bought; no sound leak; great audio quality; sturdier than the Other Brand"" is what will make me buy.<p>As for blogs, god help me from another boring ill-conceived company blog. Over the course of a year, I consume products from hundreds of manufacturers and brands. You think I am going to add them all on my RSS feed? The blogs I read are by real human beings on deeply human topics. Not about which pair of shoes has sexy heels.<p>The reality is that in most cases, a consumer has a very brief relationship with a manufacturer eg, ""My headphones broke. I need new headphones. I will research headphones. I will buy headphones. Done with headphones"". A social network is based on building long term relationships. I do not want a long-term relationship with an entity I am only going to deal with once every three years.<p>Things like Nike are exceptions because it is a kind of brand that has fans, just like a sports team. It then becomes a special interest group, not just a commercial communication.<p>The comparison to Second Life is very apt, I find.",1240864938
582065,comment,580209,581904,0,0,Ardit20,,,"Oh No, I'm far too young haha. However, this may be my own interpretation on the past, but I believe I remained a good student because of my family's continual emphasis that whether I study or not is for my own benefit. I eventually came to understand that studying is important for some reason, but I believe that I remained a good student because I found it interesting. Of course the repetitive exercises of maths have nothing interesting in them, chemistry is very near to Chinese, but history and literature was quite interesting for me. I do not know, I mean I had a sense that to study is important therefore I was committed to it but I think I kept such commitment because when I got into it I found it interesting. I think children perhaps fail to give school learning a chance. It may be the culture amongst the children hence the parents have some responsibility, it might perhaps be affected by the child's mental ability to grasp the content. For example, year 1 of high school we had this maths theorem and I spend 4 hours trying to understand it and in the end I had a good knowledge of its working but not an 'understanding' or a grasp of the theorem. Needless to say for that year I got an E in maths :P.<p>I do not really like these discussion about schooling and university though. It seems too simple to me to completely disregard the job that thousands of teachers are doing worldwide to teach these kids and consider schooling or universities a failure. Perhaps no one told them that this system has been evolving for nearly a millennia.<p><i>My daughter doesn't stay bored for long because she's curious about everything</i><p>Sure she is curious but the question is whether she and the many kids like her keep such curiosity. I remember from my early years many of my friends saying they excelled until grade four, others probably excelled until grade eight. I have said it before and I would like to repeat that schooling is such a big thing, it encompasses life itself. I do not think these kids are much different from us adults, they too would rather not do their school work but play, at other times love doing their school work, they too have their peer influence and for what an alcoholic would be alcohol for them may be going on the streets and measuring the pavements.<p>Schooling is there to develop these children and introduce them to life and how it works and above all lets not forget they are kids they do want some fun and they will be mischievous and not bother at times. Schooling is not to teach these kids how to live their life though. The school and life brings to these kids as much as these kids have to bring to life and school.<p>So how do you make this marvellous system, maybe the pinnacle of civilisation which is now perhaps universal, save the most deprive parts of this world, to become even better. I do not know but however advance our schooling system becomes it may not be immune to the criticism that it is failing many children perhaps because there is only so much that the environment may affect our biological make up. We have evolved under certain influences and sure we may be traced to one mother, but the mother after that may make as much difference down the trail of heritability. It is clear that evolution works through specialising in a certain area, i.e. faster legs, bigger jumping ability, taller neck, venom, whatever gives one an advantage and something the other doesn't have. There is no reason to not suggest that this civilisation takes this specialisation into a mental arena rather than physical. This world has so much to offer and it needs so many things to be done, it is inevitable perhaps that many children will specialise to do things outside of the schooling system while others thrive at it and as in my case like it but go on to do my own thing as well. To conclude therefore, schooling is not an end point, it is a swing board.",1240864931

So I get all the nice scripting benefits and never have to deal with the windows shell scripting for dev purposes.<p>The hardware issue is a BIG fucking deal. I just got a mac mini at work for testing. ONLY ONE VIDEO PORT! So no dual screen. My PC? Oh no dual output? no problem a hundred bucks will solve that problem. To make it worse I can't upgrade my mini with a new card, gota get a new mini. (sorry just got = right before their new model was released)<p>So yea mac is a pain still. I want a nice motherboard like a PC has, and a nice case like a PC has, and as powerful/weak as a mac mini, for the mac mini price. If I need a new card Ill buy one. But that's not available, gota get me the $2000 power mac.",1240863953

This helps with IO bound applications where you can have tens of thousands of tasklets running at the same time (try doing that with threads). It does not however allow you to take advantage of multi-core or multi-processor resources. It simply allows you to squeeze the most amount of work out of a single threaded process...""<p><a href=""http://www.stackless.com/pipermail/stackless/2007-August/001963.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stackless.com/pipermail/stackless/2007-August/001...</a>",1240863820

218372,comment,218195,218306,0,0,jamesbritt,,,"Well, it depends.<p>I co-wrote Pro VB 6 & XML, back around 2000.   I was lucky; it was a topic I (at the time, at least) knew fairly well, and a good part of what I wrote was based on a project I was actually building at my Real Job.  There was some time spent researching technical details for the W3C XML DOM and VB this and that, but overall I think the time O spent for the money received worked out quite well.<p>So you might that that was a good thing, except, being my first real writing job, it gave me serious misconceptions about making money as a writer.<p>Not too long after that book I contracted with Wrox to write Beginning Ruby.  Long story short, it was tedious and painful and I got next to no money before Wrox went bankrupt.   Even had they not, and had the book been completed and published, I seriously doubt the time/money ratio would have beat simply getting a job as a waiter.  The tech book market had, at that time, turned to crap, and Ruby was barely a blip on anyone's radar.<p>A bigger issue was that such a book required far more technical research.  Basically, it meant a lot of work to ensure that what I wrote was actually true.<p>I've done assorted writing since then trying to be more careful about picking assignments, but it's not often like that first time.<p>That's not to say people can't or don't make money writing tech books, but it really helps if a) you can write with authority without having to keep looking stuff up to verify accuracy, and b) you manage to hit a sweet spot in timing and audience interest.<p>(Or, c) you don't give a crap about the quality of your work and happily pump out drivel that gets past shoddy tech reviewers prior to publication.  Please do not do that; there is enough of that already.)",1213588738

Software is not biology, and it's developer's time is very valuable.  I'd say that this site in particular is very valuable, because the developer behind it is PG, and there are a lot of readers who are hackers and founders.<p>If you want to game a system, please go game some other system like Reddit, or Digg.  Please don't mess with Hacker News.  It's hard enough to maintain the signal to noise ratio as it is without people purposefully gaming the system.",1213588704

218369,comment,218347,218347,0,0,JamesBrooks,,,"We've had this problem a lot, even with specific in house policies for how mail should be sent from our web applications. I've found that making sure the SPF record is correct and very 'tight' helps a lot. Also make sure before you're mail server isn't running as an open relay well before you send a test e-mail to Hotmail (make sure everything is perfect before you send to hotmail).<p>After that, don't just start sending a large bulk of e-mail to hotmail, send a few (they'll run some tests, open port, check SPF, etc!!). After a bit then start shipping mail out to hotmail.<p>Even after all of this you can still be up the creak, we've gone to using AuthSMTP at work now (having Postfix directly proxy the requests on). It's fast and we can deliver to hotmail (a lot less stuffing around).",1213588405

218366,comment,218347,218347,0,0,hhm,,,"I had more simple problems with Hotmail. I had many cases where people sent me mails to Yahoo and Gmail accounts and if they came from Hotmail mail addresses, they just didn't reach me at all. Some Hotmail users I knew had difficulties even to subscribe to Google and Yahoo Groups too (for the same reason). Mail sent FROM Hotmail accounts many times doesn't even go to spam folders.",1213587231

I'm kind of surprised to see it at the top, I actually submitted this when I first released looking for some feedback, but it was buried pretty quickly.<p>I've talked a bit about the technical aspects in another thread here:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=203952"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=203952</a><p>I'd love to answer any questions anyone has, and I'm especially interested in getting any feedback on the purchase proposition and payment process if anyone does decide to buy it.",1213586189

That is what I agreed with.<p>I apologize for going further and adding  ""Silence is louder than downvoting"" as it may imply  you said so.<p>""Exactly what did you mean? Just tell us, openly and honestly, and let us surprise you with our open response. For a community that puts a premium on the clever smarta$$ retort, we still value sincerity above all.""<p>I have always been open, and honest, and sincere. And being open and sincere and honest has cost me a few karma points and so will they again when I hit ""reply"". I respect each and everyone here.<p>""So instead of worrying about the rules of the game, why not just explain what you meant and let the chips fall where they may. In a forum like this, that's pretty much the best any of us can do.""<p>I take it you thought I was being sarcastic. I agreed with you and I failed to explain why I did. Again I have been participating ""in a forum like this""  for a few days and I respect anyone here and I would not undermine anyone's comment or post.<p>EDIT:  I apologize if some users (Thaumaturgy...)have  a hard time understand my writing.

218354,comment,218347,218347,0,0,gexla,,,"Common problem with Hotmail and a bit of a crapshoot.  I assume you have done all the general SPF stuff.  There is a postmaster website for Hotmail (guidelines, contact info and other tools) and also a whitelist that you can get on if you are ready to pay out the nose.  Google around for it.<p>One thing you can do is to get an account with an external SMTP service (such as Authsmtp) and configure your email server (such as Postfix) to relay your email through that service.  Many people use Gmail for this but Gmail requires unique settings that can make this kind of a pain.  This allows you to piggyback on the deliverability of the other service.<p>If you are sending out newsletters, you might consider going with a specialized service such as Constant Contact.<p>If you look around, there are more blog posts and information sites that are more detailed.  One of them is on hacker news as I type this.  Good luck.",1213585714

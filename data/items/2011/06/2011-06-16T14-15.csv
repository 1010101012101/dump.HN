The whole thing should basically be able to be moved around while the page stays static. If it's doing that, then it's working correctly. It's a little unpolished to use in the demo, but basically the workflow is that you select the box, then move the overlay so you can see the error, then line up the box with left / top.<p>The landing page uses Cufon for font replacement which in turn uses the canvas. I like the way it renders the font but maybe it's impractical..<p>Also the page has overflow:hidden on the body. The editor behaves weirdly sometimes with scrolling so it's disabled for now but will support scrolling in the release.<p>All the other features are great suggestions, i'll make sure they are all in the release too - re: the Javascript debugger..

I could click on any pixel with a theoretical max of 26 keyboard presses, but I also wrote in a ""nevermind"" key, so I could engage the key again for certain cases. For example, say the cursor was in the middle of the screen and I wanted to go 15% towards the left.

Perhaps the reason that people think many computer-oriented people are introverted is because they choose to spend time in front of their computer instead of interacting with people (irl) and therefore don't develop their social skills as much.",1308234567

2661346,comment,2660784,2660784,5,0,brendino,,,"SAP's lack of openness is a huge problem, and will continue to hinder its development.  Not only does the license cost millions of dollars, but then the enterprise that purchases it has to hire dozens to hundreds of expensive consultants to actually implement the behemoth.  And if the company wants to actually understand how to use the system, they need to invest in expensive training sessions because any sort of public documentation (or documentation shipped with the system) is far too vague to actually provide usefulness.<p>I tend to think that the lack of openness is done on purpose - that is, SAP depends on its consulting partners to help sell its software, so they need an incentive to sell it (not to mention, SAP has a consultancy itself).<p>SAP has tried to evolve recently with new developments like HANA (mentioned in the article) and MII (tool used to connect manufacturing systems and provide real-time KPI dashboards), but without a more-open ecosystem that enables learning and innovation, it will continue to stagnate as modern technology overtakes it.<p>The biggest hindrance preventing companies from ditching SAP for a modern system is the fact that SAP is so complex and can handle so many business scenarios.  Although it stands behind the curve in terms of technological innovation, it has decades of business specific functionality built into the system.  That's the main reason, in my opinion, for why enterprises haven't jumped ship.",1308234363

I think there is insight in that. Not every big new online service can have the long-term revenue growth and user engagement that Google has managed to achieve. (Some of the stories about Groupon point out aptly that Groupon spends much of its revenue on Google promotions, so who is the winner when Google, a profitable company, is paid by Groupon, a company that is losing money on every sale?)<p>That said, Facebook is the one online service that gets more engagement from me, by far, even than HN or all the Google properties other than Gmail. Facebook's algorithm for prioritizing posts from friends into my home page works amazingly well at showing me the content I want to see. The Facebook secret groups feature works well for me at forming more tightly knit communities. All in all, what's cool about Facebook is that I see FRIENDS there, people I'm glad to see in real life or online.<p>Back when nobody needed to buy floppy disks, because AOL was endlessly mailing those out to everyone in America, I was subscribed to AOL for a while. I couldn't understand why people preferred the chat-like user discussion interface of AOL to the more threaded discussions available on other online services at the same time. I found AOL rather tedious, and eventually unsubscribed, but millions of users stayed on AOL long after I thought it had lost all of its competitive advantage over other ways of getting on the Internet. AOL had the financial strength and reputation to take over (and drain of value) Time Warner, and it still hasn't completely disappeared. I think Facebook will do at least that well for at least that long. Maybe Facebook is already in a long decline, but it will be a long, slow decline.",1308233822

It all depends on what your goals are of course, but one bonus is that unlimited historical data is all out there and easy to get (so you could pick many periods or even have the computer pick them).

The faster you're done using google, the less time you spend there, the better they're doing. Gmail and apps are more time consuming but I think a certain level of ""well, I have no choice to do the this work or not, I might as well have a nice interface"" comes into play when using those.<p>Google's tools seem more about facilitating accomplishing something else as fast as possible, while facebook is the ends in and of itself.  How long you spend on facebook is the metric of how well facebook is doing.<p>At least thats my take on it.",1308233408

Ive reached a state where it achieved some usefulness. Therefore I would like to share it with you and get some feedback before I go any further with it.<p>http://www.cloudorado.com/  (it may not work without www yet).<p>The service is something like pricegrabber.com for cloud computing  you specify resources you need for cloud servers and it will present offers from multiple providers.<p>It is done in GWT + SmartGWT. Ive chosen this technology, since it allows client side calculations, without network and server delays. Therefore you can use sliders and see how prices change without any delay. There is one side effect though  it is quite big to load. So to minimize the negative effect of loading at start I present a static version (widgets does not work at all), which is replaced with actual interactive version as soon as it loads up. You shouldnt even notice it, unless you try using sliders or links before it actually boots up. Probably this is a good subject for another article.<p>Going back to the feedback I have several areas that bothers me, so I would really appreciate if you could take them into account.<p>1. Usefulness: Would the site be useful for you if you planned to buy cloud server? What should be added, what is irrelevant? Is the missing thing crucial enough to prevent me from going further?<p>2. Ease of use: Is it simple enough to understand it without explanation?<p>3. Name: Im not a native English speaker, so it is difficult for me to judge how a name sounds for natives and if it easy to remember. The other top candidates were cloudcruncher.com and cloudcomparator.com . Huge advantage for cloudorado.com is that there are virtually no results in Google for that. Which would you choose?<p>4. Business model  I mostly plan to earn on cloud providers affiliate programs or charge per click. Which of those you think would be better? Any other ideas?<p>Obviously I dont think the service is done now, but hopefully something like alpha would apply. Therefore feedback is really critical at this point and I really appreciate any comments. I hope it will save me some dead ends.<p>Thank you!<p>Marcin",1308233104

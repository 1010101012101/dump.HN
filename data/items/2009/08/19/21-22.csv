As a guide for a typical windows-only IT wonk to install an sshd, it's really not bad.  But I like to believe (or at least pretend) that a typical HN reader is a little above that level.  To folks here, the critical information is that (1) openssh works under cygwin and (2) there's a simple installable distro for it.  That information is conveyed just fine by the link to the upstream package, without the need for a tutorial.<p>Add that to the fact setting up a remote access (!) mechanism on a host is an inherently security-critical operation that requires a clear low-level understanding of the software (i.e. more than can be taught with screenshots), and I guess I got a little cranky.",1250719055

773867,comment,771946,771946,0,0,tetha,,,"TBH, I don't really care about being able to program a nontrivial program in a zillion languages. Cutting code is just a tool.<p>I much rather want to be able to think in data and I want to be able to easily grok the runtime model of a language, because if I can do that, getting able to write large things in a new language is not that hard. Certainly, if you never knew C and just look at it's runtime model (with the crucial part pretty much being the difference of data on the stack and on the heap), you won't be able to write an industry-strenght *nix-kernel immediately, but on the other hand, after about a week or two of doing stuff in C, you will be able to do quite a lot.<p>This is also the reason why I look at a lot of languages, but mostly stick with python. Most languages don't offer a better tradeof than python (even though I am still eagerly waiting for Haskell':) ), so I don't see a reason spending a month or two just doing stuff in them. If it grows necessary, I will certainly be able to do so, but currently, I don't need to annoy myself too much :)",1250718559

773789,comment,773473,773473,0,0,lisper,,,"This sounds very impressive, but if you think about it they've really solved a very uninteresting problem.  What they have done is essentially layered a sound type system on top of C, and run a particular C program (the kernel) through this type checker.  (It's a little more sophisticated than that, but that's the gist of it.)  You could accomplish exactly the same thing by simply writing the code in a language like Haskell or Lisp that had a sound type system built in as part of its design.  Haskell and Lisp programs have all the same properties as the L4 kernel: they never overflow their buffers, never dereference null pointers, never leak memory, and never have arithmetic overflows.  But when you think about it that way, it's a much less impressive result.  The only thing that makes this interesting at all is that they wrote their code in C.  This is rather like climbing a mountain carrying a 500lb weight.  Yes, in a sense it's impressive, but it's a lot easier to scale the mountain if you just don't pick up that 500lb weight to begin with.",1250716431

But the further you get into the project, and the more complex things you are trying to do with larger and larger datasets, the ORM ends up blowing up in your face.  For example, LINQ to SQL--which I want to emphasize I'm picking on only because I'm using it righ tnow--happens to silently and transparently convert from IQueryable (meaning that your LINQ will execute in the DB) to IEnumerable (which means you'll suck in all data required for filtering past that point), which means that you never have a good idea whether your query is going to be optimized or not unless you check the SQL being generated.  When you have to do this a few dozen times, you start wishing you'd just written SQL in the first case.<p>The situation gets worse when you start getting into join-heavy queries.  I've never seen an ORM that actually can cover everything you need to make an app performant.  It doesn't handle full joins, or compound indices, or distinguishing between clustered and nonclustered indices, or calculated columns, or some other thing that, if you were in raw SQL, would easily solve your problem, so at that point, you start introducing raw SQL.  The older your app gets, the more instances of this you get, until you'd have been better off simply using SQL the entire time anyway.<p>I love the idea of an ORM in theory, but I'm pretty solidly convinced these days that if you want objects, you should us an OODBMS, and otherwise, you should just embrace the relational model for what it is, and not pretend you're working with objects.  For most people, that'll mean writing SQL and getting back query sets.",1250716214

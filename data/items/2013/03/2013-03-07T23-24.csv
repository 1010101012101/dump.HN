Math is awesome, but waving it around as if to automatically lends credibility to your argument is a poor showing IMHO.<p>Specifically, quantum decoherence is simply not accepted as a thing that exists on a macro scale. You're post presents no claim that is testable, despite the bold headline to the contrary.<p>Lets look at an example of a what physicists consider to be a falsifiable claim: The Standard Model predicts the existence of a new elementary particle, the Higgs Boson. This could be tested experimentally in theory, and later it was tested in practice, once the capability existed (LHC).<p>Or another example: orbital mechanics predicts the location of the asteroid Apophis will pass unusually close (<100 000KM) to earth in 2029.[1]<p>Now of course if Apophis fails to show up, or shows up overly late or in the wrong place etc, that doesn't necessarily invalidate the theory, but there does eventually need to be a credible explanation.<p>The simplest is usually measurement error, or silly human error etc. But every now and then, there are discrepancies that just don't go away, and those are often the ones that lead interesting new theories pushing science forward.<p>TBH I don't think your post does that.<p>The failing of physicists to take your above link seriously, does not epistemically speaking invalidate the claim of course, but it should be pause for concern.<p><i>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99942_Apophis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99942_Apophis</a> </i>",1362700635

5341233,comment,5339261,5339479,16,0,lsc,,,">I never quite understood the love for premium vps like linode<p>This is true now (Linode is a premium vps provider)  but it was not always true.  Linode started out cheap, like almost everyone in our industry does.  Linode was one of the first in the market;  they've been selling VPSs longer even than I have.<p>>Its nice that they are now increasing the bandwidth cap, but it was on the low side to begin with. My takeaway from this is that ""linode finally joins everyone else in network speed and bandwidth.""<p>Eh, the way the industry works is that price pressure is applied by new entrants.  Linode used to be that 'incredibly cheap provider'  -  but generally speaking?  as you develop a reputation, you increase your resource allocations more slowly than moore's law would allow, and Linode has a pretty good reputation, so they get to charge substantially more than new entrants to the market.<p>So yeah, if the new entrants aren't a way better deal in terms of resources?  something is terribly wrong (and that new entrant probably won't gain the traction they need to survive long enough to be able to let their prices rise to a higher margin level)<p>I mean, personally, I would think I have been letting my own prices rise (comparatively, I mean, by not increasing resource allocation)  more than my reputation would allow me to... but I'm still gaining customers (though not at an awesome rate)  -  Linode announcing a network upgrade is putting /incredible/ pressure on me to upgrade my network.   I can be okay with a new entrant flying below me, but Linode has a better reputation than I do;  I have to provide more resources per dollar than they do.<p>Now, the big counterexample here is slicehost.  Slicehost started out fairly expensive (compared to the industry standard at the time)  and they went from zero to twenty thousand customers in like two years.  It was incredible.      I don't know exactly what they did, but they had a reputation for providing managed hosting level service for (premium) unmanaged hosting prices.<p>Now, how much of that reputation was marketing, and how much of that reputation was that their support really was that good, I don't know, but I do know that was their reputation.",1362700568

The area was constantly penetrated by Chinese and White Russian terrorist groups, and the idea was to shield the territory by establishing a settlement whose inhabitants would be hostile to White Russian emigres, especially the Cossacks.  The status of the region was defined shrewdly as an autonomous district, not as an autonomous republic, which meant that no local legislature, high court, or government post of ministerial rank was permitted.

5341223,comment,5337558,5339834,1,0,emidln,,,"Anyone with private key access has control over my user account and has better access than what my private key + passphrase would provide.<p>I understand layers (probably moreso than most), but this is something that always bothers me a lot from a practicality perspective. My passwords are encrypted at rest via encrypted filesystems. If you are running things on my personal machine as my user account, I'm already being keylogged and/or am executing arbitrary code for you. If I'm logged into somewhere via ssh (hint: I am whenever I have a network connection), you can just scan my ssh config and use my ssh key anyway. From there, you can probably do a lot of other nasty stuff. ssh-agent won't really prevent this. It will prevent the malware from working again when I reboot until I log into another remote host (which I've established I do a lot) where the keylogger now gets me.<p>It's possible, but extremely unlikely that I have might have completely read-only media. I could be using my TPM device to protect from from booting and executing modified system states. Some of this might prevent you from easily persisting the keylogger threat across reboots. I might also have a module or something that calculate checksums on startup of critical things, have ridiculous anti-exfil outgoing connection policies, etc that prevent all but the most targeted attacks.<p>I don't have all of that in place. (In particular, to anyone generating a profile for me, I don't build detailed outgoing packet filter rules (you are welcome).)  But what I do have in place will probably prevent me from getting my initial passphase keylogged if I used ssh-agent since it's likely (although this isn't strictly necessary) that I'm going to get attacked again after I start logging into remote hosts. So they can't steal my password, but they do have unrestricted access to my user account and the remote users I can log into. That complicates things, but is still a major security failure, to the point where them having the passphrase to my key isn't super important. I mean, in this scenario, they already have the absolute best input vector (a history of me logging in so they can execute attacks at the times I'm supposed to be logging in, as well as direct access to the systems from my ip addresses) to the point where using my ssh key from elsewhere is probably a worse a idea.",1362700418

That's how the flirtation with anti-Semitism started in high party echelons...Stalin's efforts after the war were focused on extending Soviet hegemony, first over the countries of Eastern Europe bordering the Soviet Union and then everywhere he was in competition with British interests.  He foresaw that the Arab states would turn to the Soviet Union when they were frustrated by British and American support for Israel.  The Arabs would appreciate the anti-Zionist trends in Soviet foreign policy...I was told by Vetrov, Molotov's Assistant, what Stalin said: 'Let's agree to the establishment of Israel.  This will be a pain in the ass for the Arab states and will make them turn their backs on the British. In the long run it will totally undermine British influence in Egypt, Syria, Turkey, and Iraq.'""",1362700055

Yes, it happens sometimes, but most of the time there is no need to invent a story that was true. Embellishments of true stories are more typical.<p>As far as the comparison with others, including other ethnic groups as well as individuals: indeed, Jews were far from the only target, and often were targeted not as Jews specifically. Several (more than 20) ethnic groups suffered much worse under the Soviet system than the Jews did. However, when we talk specifically about college admissions, Jews were targeted as such, and in this aspect they (I guess I should say we) suffered more. Here too Jews were not the only targeted group (or in many cases not the only non-privileged group) but it was much more widespread against the Jews, and I would say more cynical as well.<p>When in the US I am asked if the stories about Jewish persecution in the USSR are true, I usually say ""the short answer is yes but the correct answer is yes but"". In addition to the above, I usually also point out that this is almost nothing compared to, say, the way the Nazis persecuted Jews, and all of the families that were targeted by the Soviet system were (directly or indirectly) also targeted by the Nazi system, and here the Soviet system takes a very distant second.

There are ostensibly reasons to have an online component for the new Sim City that is outside of the realm of DRM, but if you think about it, those reasons (players control other cities in your region) could easily be duplicated with simple AI or local multiplayer.

There was a category of ""top"" colleges which ran exams in July, while all others ran exams in August, like this guy who failed in top choice in July still had option to take exams in August (like my mom who failed with Institute of mechanics and Optics in July applied for Pedagogical Institute in August, or Alik [her uncle] who was not admitted in Moscow university applied in Kharkov in August etc.) And some people who were fighting actually succeeded (like Alena [her aunt] whom they gave either 4 or 3 in math said she knows well enough to get 5, so the examiner said, ""I will have to call a head of the commission"", Alena said, ""So call him.""

We immigrated to a heavily Asian community (Cupertino) when we moved to the United States, so I'm also acutely aware of the prejudice many brilliant Asian students face in college admissions here.]<p>The anti-Asian discrimination in elite private universities in US, is nothing compared to the Soviet system.<p>For starters, in Soviet Union, if one did not get into the one university they applied to, they would be drafted into the military. In United States if an individual does not get into Stanford, they would probably be accepted into Berkeley, UT Austin, UW, UCLA, or the like -- provided they're qualified to get into Stanford and are denied due to affirmative action. That, in a nutshell, is the huge difference.<p>There is, however, one major similarity between Soviet Union's anti-Jewish discrimination and the anti-Asian quotas/""affirmative action""/discrimination in the United States: they are both ""plausibly deniable"", vague, and ill-understood. This in opposition to the strictly set percentage-based quotas used by Ivy Leagues against Jews in the early twentieth century and in Tzarist Russian Universities at roughly the same time: an applicant knew what the quota was, so it was possible to calculate how well one would need to do to get into a specific university.<p>The ""holistic"" admissions process in American universities as well as the rigged exams, deliberately lowering of grades, etc... in Soviet universities were essentially unpredictable -- no one had a clear picture of what their chances were when applying to a specific university.<p>In both cases prejudice at the most elite universities (Moscow State University in Soviet Union, Stanford and the Ivy Leagues in the United States) lead to many strong students/grad-students/post-doc researchers going to what were once ""lesser"" colleges (""Public Ivies"" in the United States, universities in non-Russian Soviet republics, e.g., Belarusian State University -- where my dad was a professor) which in turn made them more academically rigorous and reputable.<p>Overall, American system with all its flaws is many orders of magnitude better: I'll gladly take American system at its worst (e.g., being a Jewish student in the 1920s and 1930s) over the Soviet system as its best. There are simply far more opportunities for young people who do not fit the ""mold"": if you do not get into a good university in US right out of high school you can attend a community college and then transfer. Even if one doesn't have the means, time, or requisite psychological profile to graduate from a university it isn't a career death sentence: while drop-out success stories are over-stated, it's still clearly possible (even if significantly harder) to find knowledge-work (i.e., enter the ""intelligentsia"" class) for someone who did not graduate from or even attend a university.[1]<p>The downside of collectivism and equality is the attitude that ""the nail that sticks out gets hammered down"". America's ""rugged individualism"" has a cost (often times ""in-your-face"" inequality), but individual freedom -- broadly understood, not <i>only</i> in the political realm -- including the freedom to carve out your own educational and career path is what made the (difficult) decision to immigrate to the United States worth it for us. My parents abandoned a privileged lifestyle (a flat in city center, a country home, a tenured professorship, guaranteed retirement, excellent public transportation, etc...) to come to the United States as they knew it would be one of the few places where someone like myself (or even my older and already college educated brother) could have a fulfilling life and career.<p>[1] To any young hackers reading this: please don't take it as encouragement to drop out from or -- even worse -- not attend college in the first place. Even if there was absolutely no career benefit to attending a university, it is still worth it. Here's just one example: unless you get lucky, it will be a long time in the industry until you're considered to have enough experience to be ""allowed"" to build an operating system, TCP/IP stack, a compiler -- or to build something non-trivial in Haskell, Lisp or ML; yet, these are routine projects in undergrad CS classes. On the other hand, if after making a genuine effort, you discover you simply cannot learn in a structured setting such as a secondary or tertiary educational institution, <i>do not</i> surrender your career inspirations: plenty of choices are still available to you.",1362698126

I am a Russian living in the US with Jewish family in Russia. This is a throw away account.<p>With that said, stories of anti-semitism told by Russian Jews in US should not be taken at face value. These folks are subject to a very strong selection bias. Most of them came to the US as refugees who were recognized by the US State Department as being discriminated against for being Jewish in USSR/Russia. Secondly they have interest in maintaining the story anti-seminitism because it validates their narrative and could potentially help their relatives immigrate to the US.<p>Additionally many stories of anti-semitism that I heard were something a non-jew would experience as well but attributed to anti-semitism. As a personal example, I was at first denied admission to a specialized school in very late Soviet period. They eventually let me in because my mother found out that I had the highest score on the entrance exam of any one. Their excuse was that they had to let the kids who were in the paid summer program at the school first and now the class was full. A Jewish kid's parents would have been told they already have too many Jews in the advanced program. Both cases are just the admissions persons asking for a bribe.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4752047"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4752047</a>",1362697563

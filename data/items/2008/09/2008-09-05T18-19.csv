For example, we have IE6 where I work and I don't see it changing anytime soon.<p>However, by dropping IE6 support, its not to say everything on the site will be broken if you drop support. It'll just mean that from here on out, its possible things don't look or work quite as advertised, and it is suggested you upgrade your browser.

296157,comment,295847,295922,0,0,silencio,,,"> I haven't used an iPhone 3G, but people seem to think it's an inferior product in various ways.<p>When I complained about the lack of 3g on the original iPhone, I knew why, I understood the drawbacks, I understood the reasoning. I had prior experience with 3g mobile phones and personally knew that even with said drawbacks that it would be something I could live with. So I bought the original iPhone, then gave it up for the 3g iPhone when released. Don't regret it at all now..the only thing I want now is the mophie juice pack so I don't have to worry so much about battery (not that it's exceptionally bad in only the iPhone, it's pretty bad in most 3g phones, and iPhone more so for some of the applications). I <i>love</i> 3G on my iPhone.<p>> Another complaint is that third-party apps tend to crash a lot. Apple had that problem solved last year, too: They didn't permit third-party apps.<p>When I complained about the lack of an SDK for the phone, it was knowing that this was a brand new project (relatively) but that every single public excuse of Apple's was full of shit. I might also note that I jailbroke my phone on 1.1.x firmware and apps crashed too. Yes, Apple has some issues with 2.x (bug report time!), but a lot of the crashing is developer error. Like with any other program. No surprises there. Anyone expecting perfection in this area is completely delusional. Plus, I'd take a crash happy iPhone with third party apps over nothing. Makes my phone much more of a pleasure to use. Even if Apple ignored the third party app request, people would still be hacking away at it anyway (yay jailbreak).<p>> And the fact that the phone is now more expensive?<p>I realize the 3g iPhone is subsidized. I realize it's more expensive in the long run. But many phones are like that. I don't approve of Apple's marketing (it's ""cheaper""! uh huh), but...really...just don't buy it if you don't like it, like you say.<p>Anyway, all this to say that maybe I'm not a typical fangirl, but there's plenty legitimate reasons to criticize, and some people are doing it understanding the whole situation.<p>On a sidenote, most people I've encountered complaining about 3g have nobody but themselves to blame. Yes there are some legitimate issues with 3g on the iPhone, but a lot of these people are overestimating what AT&T can give to them - i.e. it's not the phone they should be blaming in their case, it's AT&T's service or lack thereof. And personally, AT&T is the worst part of the whole iPhone experience, every single one of my troubles starting from day 1 has been with them and only once with Apple (solved in under a day with a free exchange and a store manager apologising, whoops).<p>edit: Lastly, there's a lot of old iPhones out there, some for cheap. I managed to sell my 8gb one for just over $220 (not so great cosmetic condition), and although prices don't seem to be dropping much, they're still out there. Wish AT&T would let people purchase the edge plan with the 3G phone though, I bet that would make you change your mind too :)",1220640111
296156,comment,296082,296150,0,0,gabrielroth,,,"Well, the same argument applies with regard to work computers. If enough sites are broken in IE6 -- especially work-related sites and web apps, not just time-wasting sites -- then corporate IT departments will have to upgrade.<p>That said, the strategy outlined in the article runs into the collective action problem: if every web developer in the world stopped supporting IE6 at the same time, all web developers would benefit. But individual web developers have an incentive to keep supporting IE6, keep their user base happy, and free-ride on the sacrifices of other sites that drop IE6 support. So it's hard for an initiative like this one to gain much ground.",1220640021

I'm sure that they did actually get a ton of useful feedback from it that they can use to improve their service.  In this case, though, it came at the cost of being branded a failure by many people.<p>If they had avoided the boastful claims and stuck to low profile releases, they could have gathered useful feedback without the expectation of being a great search engine.

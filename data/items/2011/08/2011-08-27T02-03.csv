Obj-C inherits the use of header files from C, but its Smalltalk-derived use of dynamic dispatch means that you can call methods whether or not you have seen a declaration.<p>Header files don't exist because someone once decided they were a great linguistic idea; they exist because they were a clever hack for making compile-time type checking work across source files on a machine with less than a megabyte of RAM.<p>Objective-C has had little or no impact on language design. It has been around for over twenty years, but until recently it was just an obscure little branch of the C family tree that never went anywhere. Only after the iPhone took over the world did anyone start to pay attention - but that's because Objective-C is the only way to write iPhone apps, not because everyone suddenly decided the language itself was great.<p>From a language design point of view, there's not much going on to inspire interest. It's an old familiar way of thinking about objects bolted onto an old familiar way of thinking about systems programming, and what's surprising is simply that it works smoothly despite the awkwardness of the marriage.

YMMV.<p>I liked how you built up the use of the framework, gradually adding events, templating, iteration etc.<p>I would like to be able to follow along (doing the same steps myself), but I didn't understand the starting point of your project (is it a sinatra app?).
Do you have instructions on how to get setup to that point?
A screencast for setup would be great, but even a list of pointers would be helpful.<p>Keep up the good work!",1314410789

The game would be to take the minimum risk and do well enough to not get fired, and that's it.<p>If Tim Cook manages to double the stock price, he'll have $700m. If it drops to $100, he'll have $100m. It's a big difference, and his interests and risks are aligned with the shareholders.<p>Anyway, that's the theory. Give too much stock, and you're impoverishing the shareholders for little benefit. Don't give enough, and a superstar might decide he'd rather do a startup or an incubator LOL, or he may not want to pursue the same kind of risk-reward as the people who hire him.<p>$100m is still a great deal of money. I guess going to $700m, it's the difference between superrich for life, and a legacy of being a great leader and dynastic wealth LOL. Nice work if you can get it.",1314410706

2930591,story,,,1,0,JesseAldridge,"Anyone want to trade illustrative code snippets?",,"So I've found that one of the most effective ways of speeding up development is to maintain small snippets of code demonstrating how to do various things.<p>For example, here's a chunk of example code I posted to StackOverflow showing how to handle xml data in Python with lxml:<p>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6432826/preferred-python-xml-processor/6433099#6433099<p>I actually have a fairly large library of similar code snippets demonstrating how to do all sorts of things.  The thing is, each snippet can take anywhere from a half-hour to a few weeks to put together -- once you account for all the research time, trial and error, refinement, etc.  Each snippet carries a great deal of hard earned knowledge.  And while sharing is nice and all, I'm not really inclined to trade a lifetime of knowledge for a bunch of points on StackOverflow.<p>But still, I find code snippets like these to be highly valuable, so I was wondering if other programmers might be willing to trade somehow.  Like say, I would give you my xml snippet and you give me a snippet illustrating how to use JQuery UI buttons (or whatever).<p>I know there are sites out there that collect code snippets, but they don't seem to be very good -- presumably due to the economic disincentive from sharing high quality examples.<p>This is still a very fuzzy idea...  And I can see there being some issues...  but maybe not insurmountable ones.  I just thought I'd put the idea out there and see what people think.<p>My email is JesseAldridge@gmail.com if you want to talk directly.",1314410523

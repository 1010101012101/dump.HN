And the easiest way to minimize this is to increase the denominator.  If you have a universe with a skewed (self-selected) distribution, then as you add more people to a category, you'll increasingly get more marginal people.  In this case, it's people who have fewer sexual partners and hence are less likely to carry AIDS, resulting in a reduced chance of infection.<p>Whether this is the metric you care about is debatable.  If you're a public health official, you probably care about the absolute <i>number</i> of infections, not the number per sexual encounter, and so this only helps if it brings the probability low enough that the disease can't sustain itself.<p>Similarly, if you're a married guy who just wants a faithful and devoted wife and kids, you don't care about the chance of infection per sexual encounter, you care about the absolute chance of infection within your life time.  This is minimized by not having sex with anyone, or, failing that, having sex with someone who only has sex with you.<p>Only people who regularly have sex with lots of partners would benefit from this - for them, the metric is chance of infection per sexual encounter (since they'll be having lots of sexual encounters anyway), so why shouldn't they?",1275782318

I know what I want and I'd be the first person to use it.<p>I've ran some numbers of this and the biggest problem is gamers won't pay for anything, they hate ads and they don't click through. So when evaluating this versus other opportunities it loses out because there are still plenty of other better options. All that being said there is a need and after you have a loyal user base there is always a way to monetize it (right!?).<p>I've seen a number of these sorts of sites come and go over the years. Even a few facebook apps. No one has come close to nailing it. It seems that founders are not gamers; they miss the boat and make it too social network like. And if they are gamers, they never seem to push the site out of it's alpha phase.",1275782076

In this case, all you have is one paradigm to think in (object-oriented (probably procedural as well, but...)). Functional programming is a completely different beast that requires different ways of thinking. Lots of the neater concepts of many popular languages now are lifted right out of functional ones. Python's list comprehensions and generators come to mind.<p>A more pragmatic reason to learn about functional programming is that it is becoming increasingly useful. Functional languages are, in general, much easier to parallelize. More importantly than that though, they make it easier to make _correct_ parallel and multi-threaded programs.<p>As for why these are often presented as the 'holy grail' of programming, many of features exist to make it simple to create concise, correct programs. The features are all the foreign-sounding buzzwords that people tend to rave about: composition, laziness, currying, lambda-functions, monads, strong type systems, type inference, higher-order functions, loop abstractions, and any number of other nifty things.<p>If you're interested in learning more, check out the Haskell or Ocaml languages (or Lisp, but Lisp isn't entirely functional).",1275780772

The html5 issue alone does not even remotely justify the negative response this page has gotten. That's a rationalization. Else, why have the dozens of articles posted here previously discussing htm5, with the same loose definition, not garnered the same emotional response?<p>The thesis I argued against is simply the best triangulation  of the multiple, weakly expressed arguments made to justify the negative reactions.<p>And the claim that these ""extensions"" are the same as MS's from years past is, to put it mildly, nonsense. This has been pointed out elsewhere, so I won't rehash it. The aggressive refusal by some folks to not recognize this looks like bias to me.",1275779798

There are infinitely many variations and intricacies in the way we humans interpret nouns, many of which are entirely context-based. That is another issue - PLs do not have a sense of context the same way we humans do (which is probably a good thing as I'd rather a PL be less vague than a highly context-sensitive conversation with a friend.)<p>For an indication of the depth of complexity of natural language and the philosophical difficulties therein, Ludwig Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations is a good place to look - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_investigations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_investigations</a>.<p>I do think there is a deeper issue with objects in that the environment in which they are constructed often fails to permit the kind of complicated interrelation that the concept of the object should actually have, i.e. there is not enough freedom to compose and combine objects in a way entirely cohesive with the way you think of the object. However that has less to do with the relationship between natural language and programming and more to do with the limitations of oop itself.",1275778984

At the end of the day it&#x27;s all about the value it provides your company and your clients. If you&#x27;re able to retain and attract users/clients then some free support could be worth it as a sign of cooperation and goodwill. If they&#x27;re already paying customers you may need to better define what&#x27;s covered by your SLA and various support agreements. However, if they are asking for advanced help outside of those agreements then you can just say you don&#x27;t provide additional support.

It&#x27;s operations are heavily bounded by legislation and politics - it is, in <i>effect</i>, a public corporation.  So tied down are they, in fact, that they have a flat price list for almost all customers.  Pricing innovation is precisely nil.  I&#x27;ve have a copy from two years ago, but I&#x27;m under NDA wrt specifics.<p>(Note that none of the above is a criticism, the idea of letting them free to do what they want is horrifying.)<p>The result of this is strange to observe from an economists vantage point.  On the one hand you can catch a glimpse of what perfect competition might look like in the consumer market as a thousand companies vie to maximise market share with an almost perfectly commoditised good, which in reality means packaging (with TV, phone, mobile, insurance, pretty much anything.)<p>Aaand on the other hand most of the country is paying £30/month ($50) for 6Mbps down/0.2Mbps up at 50:1 contention and a fair usage policy to boot.<p>Of course this is much better than straight up nationalisation as the private companies will at least innovate on peripheral services like billing and support, and will use a stronger punch when it comes to motivating BT Wholesale to stay on their toes.<p>Is this better than the US situation?

Different browsers, different bugs, after all... :]<p>I normally use FF, but there are situations where I use chrome instead (both very up-to-date versions, so more or less as good as they get).<p>chrome uses more memory on average because of the multi-process architecture, but that architecture also makes user-control of memory usage much more convenient, because closing a tab with a memory-hog page in it immediately releases a hefty chunk of memory (whereas this usually isn't the case with FF).  So sometimes when my memory is running low, I'll use chrome, despite the higher average memory usage, to get the increased controllability.<p>There are also cases of bleeding edge html5 stuff where the chrome implementation works better.  E.g., both seem to support webgl in general, but some webgl-using pages only work properly in chrome for me.<p>It's really nice to have available two completely independent implementations of a modern, featureful, robust web-browser... Before chrome, there was [on linux] basically FF and a bunch of toy browsers, and the latter were often not very usable for many pages.",1362563542

All available options on OS X suck. I couldn't give a fuck about binaries of commercial software packages working, as long as I can't manage the toolchain I depend on daily.<p>As a non-Mac-user (and fellow ThinkPad user!) that occasionally gets roped in to that crazy land, I feel your pain.  MacPorts seemed the most useful option before, simply because it seemed a direct port (heh) of the BSD ports system.  Honestly the whole thing reminded me of trying to get stuff to work on Solaris 10-15 years ago.... if you can just get your compiler working it works great, just set up /my-usr over here and make sure nothing from the real system ends up in $PATH.<p>Lately I heard that MacPorts isn't cool any more so I didn't use it for my most recent Mac-oriented client project that needed some installs.  I am a stubborn goat, but if I've learned one thing it's that when the trendy open source crowd on Mac wanders off, good luck getting <i>anything</i> to work, especially because Apple loves to change things.  So I looked around and it seems Fink is a really nice option.  So far everything went great.  If you are familiar with Debian it's like that, and it carefully segregates everything into /sw, so just make sure /sw/{bin,sbin} are first in $PATH and you'll be good.  I was recently reminded of Gentoo Prefix and wish I'd tried that out.<p>Now here is the thing that cracks me up.  I am of all things a Gentoo partisan.  My workstations?  Gentoo.  Servers for my business?  Gentoo.  Client systems?  Gentoo.  LAN server for a moderately technical friend?  Gentoo.  And I do get some gentle mockery from friends for how much of my CPU time is spent on compiling.  Yet here are the Mac acolytes, with the most consistent hardware and OS platform one could ever hope for, and they always have a fetish for compiling things from source.  Are they showing off that they know how to do ""./configure && make && make install""?  Well congratulations, you got my respect for that, now please make binary packages.

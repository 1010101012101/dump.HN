So here it is:<p>This type of risk is one that you must accept if you rely on a Service as a Software Substitute[0].<p>By relying on a remote service for your data storage and computing, you give up both freedom and control---even if the data are encrypted; we&#x27;ve all seen what information can be gleaned from metadata[1]. In this case, perhaps where a document was distributed: if Eve knows that Alice viewed document X, and Bob has a document Y that is shown (through metadata) to have been sent from Alice, and that document has certain properties that match, then it might be enough to convince a court that Bob contains document X, and get a warrant.<p>> Companies treat child pornography and abuse in a special category. But the precedent remains, and it could be tempting to extend at least the exact-match kind of search to the Paris terrorist example<p>Terrorism and child pornography are two examples that are often used to justify broad searches, chilling free speech and violating privacy.[2] These types of privacy/security &quot;trade offs&quot; start down a very slippery slope.<p>> As so much of everyone’s private communications and work migrates into the hands of a few massive private companies, the net-wide search will become too tempting to leave alone. Exactly what makes it tempting is what makes it troubling<p>You should reject those services and do your own computing![0] These remote services are not a substitute for locally installed software---a distinction that many do not consider or realize.<p>Not everyone has the technical capability to handle certain problems on their own; hosting your own e-mail server is a good example. In such cases, users should, at the very least, choose a service that commits to their privacy, to the degree that LavaBit did.<p>For social media: consider decentralized alternatives, like GNU Social[3], GNU MediaGoblin[4], and many others. Using those services will also encourage your friends and family to ask questions about why you made that choice, and consider switching themselves, since they&#x27;ll have others they know using those services. Even if you cannot host your own, you can shop around for hosts that you feel that you can trust, and still participate in the same network as your friends and family; there&#x27;s no lock-in to one service like Twitter or Facebook. Wholesale searches are also made rather difficult by distributed networks.<p>Forfeiture of privacy and freedom should not be the default, as it is encouraged today.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-s...</a>\n[1]: <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/06/why-metadata-matters"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/06/why-metadata-matters</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/08/mandatory-reporting-user-content-chills-speech-and-violates-privacy-rights"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/08/mandatory-reporting-us...</a>\n[3]: <a href=""http://gnu.io/social/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gnu.io/social/</a>\n[4]: <a href=""http://mediagoblin.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mediagoblin.org/</a>",1453006593

The thing you could get away with saying it implies is that you could have all of the other positive attributes and opportunities of those people, but not be driven and fail.

I took a few programming courses in college but don&#x27;t have a formal academic CS credential.<p>My experience has been that once you get your foot in the door, your degree doesn&#x27;t matter.  I got my first job on Craigslist.  It was a shitty work environment and paid 45k (which in NYC ain&#x27;t much), but I needed experience (and proof of income to move out of my mother&#x27;s one bedroom, ha).  Fast forward to today, I&#x27;ve just received an offer from a fast growing startup for 120k.  Compared to what the best folks in NYC are making it&#x27;s not that high, but not bad considering where I started.<p>My advice is that while things will be a bit harder in the beginning, staying hungry and ambitious and doing your best to constantly learn will have you quickly outpacing those who don&#x27;t have the same level of drive.  My policy at the jobs I&#x27;ve held has been to volunteer for every single task that I can.  I don&#x27;t even think about it anymore; if there is something that needs doing late at night or on a weekend, I just say yes.  I probably don&#x27;t need to do this as much anymore, but I think it helped me seem more useful when I started, especially since in the beginning there were pretty big gaps in my CS knowledge.  Between that and reading Hacker News obsessively I&#x27;ve become the go-to guy for many projects (seriously, I attribute a significant amount of my career success to reading about new technologies on HN).<p>Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, I don&#x27;t have any kind of public portfolio and I&#x27;ve never had anyone ask for one.

I think Americans will believe what they&#x27;re told not because they believe the government is never wrong but because they believe what the news tells them and they simply don&#x27;t care enough to dig deeper. Americans also tend to believe whatever confirms their existing biases. I suspect this is not a uniquely American problem, though.<p>> but when the head honchos of the US &quot;defence&quot; forces, the Secretary of State, and the President of the United States stands in front of the nations media and talk about the foreign bogeymen who&#x27;re out to get them, would you accept that most Americans believe them?<p>Even at the height of the post 9/11 paranoia and the Iraq war, there was plenty of skepticism and criticism of Bush&#x27;s actions. Some (admittedly many) Americans thought Bush was a hero (and still do,) and others thought he was an idiot who was playing out a power fantasy in the Middle East.

I&#x27;ve covered the geeky bucket list stuff. (making video games, blogging, open source contribution, IT jobs, BS in CS, ect.)  I&#x27;ve covered the more stereotypical bucket list stuff too. (Skydiving, performing onstage, time with friends, writing the novel, marrying the right girl, ect.)<p>At this point in my life, there&#x27;s nothing new that interests me that hasn&#x27;t already been done.

It seems that the downvotes have now been outnumbered, and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s in part thanks to your comment.<p>In all honesty, when I was last online and saw the downvotes, I was a little disappointed, as it felt that perhaps the reasonable, thoughtful comments threads that I&#x27;ve grown to love on HN were perhaps being lost to reddit-style political populism.  While one batch of downvotes or upvotes will not sway me to or away from HN, I&#x27;m happy to see HN users live up to my expectations of them.  I hope this doesn&#x27;t sound pompous.<p>Likewise, I hope you also take care and stay safe, wherever you are, toni.",1453003458

PG&#x27;s argument is that being driven is necessary, not sufficient. You have to be driven to get rich doing a startup, but being driven on its own is not enough. Thus, you can be driven and poor.<p>He then weakens his claim even further, as quoted in the parent: &quot;Variation in productivity is far from the only source of economic inequality&quot; such that he admits doing something really productive is not the only source of inequality.

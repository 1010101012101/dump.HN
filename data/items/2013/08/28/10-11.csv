6289067,comment,6287340,6288323,4,0,solistice,,,"I&#x27;m not sure what you think job creators are. Is it some kind of medal you get when you employ someone? Do you loose it if you fire them? What kind of conditions constitutes employing? Do I get to be a job creator if I give you a dollar for explaining your point?<p>Job providers, I get why those are important. Not everyone wants to be bothered with the business side of living, along with its risks. I can actually see how that division of labour and responsibilities aids both sides of the equation.<p>But if you count self-employment, there&#x27;s job providers on every rung of the social ladder. The chinese guy selling chua&#x27;r on the street is a job provider, just as much as the multimillion entrepreneur employing thousands of people.\nSo it becomes senseless to say that one wealth bracket supplies jobs, and another one doesn&#x27;t.<p>And then there&#x27;s &quot;job creation&quot;, which seems like a meaningless metric if you don&#x27;t factor in loss of jobs, current amount of jobs, unemployment, etc. And you seriously want to pin that metric down on a single group?<p>By the way, if the take the logic further, and look at who&#x27;s implicated in major job destruction (layoffs), it&#x27;s us. Hackers. I&#x27;m going from the Systems optimization definition here, and when you optimize away a part of a system, someone&#x27;s bound to get fired. Your packaging machine eliminated 5 packaging workers. Your fiber optic cable eliminated 50 post office workers.<p>They&#x27;re being added, somewhere.",1377687494

It is entirely feasible for the average person to use a high-end phone as their primary computing device.  Especially with the carrier subsidies making the up-front cost so low.

The two primary powers that emerged after the last world war are no longer at the top so there is an open gap for who&#x27;s next: the U.S. who no one wanted to mess with is overstretched, underfunded, and there is no better president to have at the helm if you want a war with the U.S. than one who has not achieved much militarily other than social reform and withdrawal, is on the edge of economic shambles due to decades of overspending much more than the stock market and media would lead you to believe, and whose party&#x27;s voting constituents aren&#x27;t in favor of a war, and Russia, who turned into a mafia-run state with former KGB at the helm that are unable to elicit much nationalism- much less a military power it used to be, doing the equivalent of selling its military assets on ebay for years.<p>Mass executions from chemical attack or otherwise are not the reason we are getting involved. This is a power struggle. Some big players (Clinton comes to mind) in U.S. Democratic party are set on cleaning up the Iran/Syria/Lebanon area, and Republicans are always up for a war.

Recruiting is by far the most black art I&#x27;ve ever suffered in the IT industry. I&#x27;ve terminated interviews with the most technically-adept people because their attitude was so risible there was no way they could be part of the company; I&#x27;ve begged interviewees who would barely speak to open up because I had a hunch they were brilliant (I was right); and I&#x27;ve hired promising and smart junior staff over proven yet jaded senior staff.<p>Trying to encompass the delightful diversity which is presented to an interviewer in a few rules is usually folly to appease the suits. You will miss great hires that way.<p>Does that matter? Well, it depends. I spoke to or interviewed one person for every 20 resumes, and hired one in every 20 interviewees. So, miss one through a bunch of dumb rules and think about the 400 resumes you will have to wade through......<p>The bottom line is that people are diverse and weird- especially engineers!- and a good interviewer with a developed spidey sense will do better for the company by ignoring daft rules regarding recruitment.<p>TL:DR<p>Recruiting is really hard and difficult to define. You will lose good hires by implementing made-up rules.",1377686428

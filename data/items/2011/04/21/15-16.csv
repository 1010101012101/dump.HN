If someone can't pay off their school debt, what's the economic return on the schooling?  I can see the objections to such analysis for undergrad, but surely the economic returns on professional education should be reflected in financial returns.<p>The replacement of ""educated"" workers by technology suggests similar value problems.  If someone is truly replaceable by automation, and can't find other work, were they ever properly educated in the first place?  Or were they socialized to a particular work ethic, and trained to follow very complicated instructions?  I would expect an educated person to use their analytic abilities and grasp of principles and ability to learn, to find how to use automation, somewhere, to do more work of better quality.  If they can't do that, then I question just how well they were educated in the first place.<p>So the bubble might be reflected not in the price, but in the crummy product delivered at that price.",1303401075

On the other hand, if your model uses cohort analysis you will see accelerating growth accurately translated into future cash flows.<p>I forget where I read it but I am pretty sure a cohort analysis of this sort was used by Evernote when they raised their round from Sequoia.<p>Edit: Clarity",1303399345

This is very common in the world. It is often found in poor states, which don't have much money for any public spending including police and fire. Often the states are autocratic or formerly-autocratic, autocratic states don't really care who's actually guilty. Very often a state is both (ex-)autocratic and poor.<p>The next step you need is a bad judiciary and a pathetic set of laws. For example, even violent kidnapping which involved mailing fingers to the victim's family, could only earn the convicted two years in jail. I am not making this up, two years at the most, by law.<p>Then lastly, have incredibly messed up laws which actually make no claim on the ransom money even if you were found guilty. Thus you can do two years in jail, and they enjoy the ransom you extorted. Often the victim's families are not particularly wealthy, or if wealthy not really capable of exacting violent street style vengeance.

I've attend start up school numerous times and have really enjoyed the experience.<p>I tell you all this because I want to make it clear that I am a real person here and not someone who has tried to promote their start up or do any kind of spam.  In this question, I will not post any links directly that go outside of HN.<p>HubPages is now a site that has been blacklisted at Hacker News (For the record, I still a big fan of HubPages even though I stopped working there in February).  All the links that I submitted from HubPages are now marked [dead] even though they work fine.  To be clear, I do not have any problem with this.  Hacker News has been maintaining a high quality of content for news stories.  I understand that this is part of what happens.<p>I understand why the links have been marked [dead].  HubPages is a user generated web site and as such, many of its users have used whatever means to promote their links.  This has resulted in low quality submissions and spammers and that's why HubPages has been uniformly blocked.  Wikipedia also has HubPages blocked (An editor at Wikipedia did eventually approve links I posted to blog.hubpages.com because they saw that they were relevant to the article on HubPages).<p>I write this because I want to make clear that all the links I posted here were to blog.hubpages.com and were to links to blog posts that I wrote and which I hoped would be interesting to the audience on HN.  These were my views on the trends in the social content space.<p>None of the stories I submitted got any above a 1 rating.  This may because it was linked to HubPages.  This may be because the content is my stories was judged not to be too interesting.  I accept those judgments.  It is those judgments which makes Hacker News such a great site!  After getting enough of those nonresponses, I stopped submitting any of my blog posts to HN.<p>My question is how does having [dead] links in your submissions affect your status at HN?  I ask this because it seems to me to be a mark of shame to have it, as if I've been labeled a spammer.  I think if someone has a large number, that should penalize them.  I have 7 of them at present.<p>I thought that it might be valuable to ask this question since other people active on this site, especially user-generated web sites will hit issues of web site reputation.  If a link that we post becomes [dead], does this have any effect on the user?  Will this person automatically be denied if they apply to start up school?  Is there any process for getting a change in status to [dead] links?<p>Is there a list anywhere of all the web sites that are currently blocked on HN?<p>Thanks very much<p>-Larry",1303398667

Instead of chasing profits they chase customers. When others are firing employees in a down market they are vacuuming the good ones up. And they don't like to share information. Other OEMs announce products months in advance, Apple you get 1 day to 1 month of a heads up. This creates a lot of disruption for analysts. They hate disruptions.

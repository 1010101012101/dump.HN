That&#x27;s one thing I haven&#x27;t ever seen anyone do better than plain old &#x27;git log -p&#x27;. I use this alias:<p><pre><code>  [alias]\n      review = log -p --reverse\n</code></pre>\nAfter `git fetch`-ing I copy the hash range that I fetched and paste it after `git review`. Then in Less I can type &quot;/^diff&quot; to use n and p to skip back and forth between commits. I find this is <i>much</i> easier to read than Github&#x27;s html diff views and <i>infinitely</i> more efficient than the millions of clicks I need in web browser to do anything (plus there&#x27;s absolutely no lag, unlike the browser).",1407034700

There is a lot of research going into determining why these disorders are often tangled together, some studies [1] suggest that depression can stem from anxiety disorders and that depression can exacerbate anxiety further. Of course there is anxiety-depression and depression-anxiety, finding out which of the these an individual has is a crucial step towards providing sufficient aid. One of the large issues is how hard it can be untangles these two disorders which is an important step in therapy.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010440X00901408"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010440X00...</a>",1407034537

8422787,comment,8421807,8422131,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"That would generate political mileage with the left, but probably generate howls of &#x27;socialism!&#x27; from the right, since the systemic nature of the financial crisis and the widespread abuses would mean multiple institutions being dismantled or split up.<p>Financial crimes are generally slow and difficult to prosecute because of the vast quantity of documentation that has to be sifted through for evidence, so when you look at the DoJ&#x27;s financial fraud page you see a bias towards smaller firms - not necessarily because they&#x27;re weaker legally, but simply because it&#x27;s easier to pinpoint individuals (eg some of the insider trading prosecutions). Another issue specific to the financial crisis is that in some cases large firms erred by being negligent and/or overconfident in their market strategies, resulting in huge losses and/or bailouts, but they imprudent rather than mendacious and their conduct did not cross the line into criminality. In a normal market those firms would have gone out of business and things would have been resolved through civil lawsuits, which was what happened with Lehman bros. and Bear Stearns. But in the financial crisis so many institutions were over-leveraged, and so many markets were moving in sync with each other (eg Europe and US both having  huge housing bubbles) that the options were government stepping in to backstop the financial industry as a whole or the collapse of the payment system, which would have been a disaster.<p>Getting back to politics, my read of the US landscape is that about 20% of the US electorate leans to the left and wouldn&#x27;t object to hanging all the bankers. About 30% leans to the right, and they&#x27;ve convinced themselves that the whole financial crisis was caused by Those Bums on Welfare and the Democratic party who forced the banks to give money to TBoW. The other 50% of the electorate is more fact- than narrative-driven and while they have misgivings about who should bear responsibility for the crisis they&#x27;re also more pragmatic and primarily concerned about economic stability. There&#x27;s a danger in this, insofar as many of the socioeconomic conditions that led up to the crisis remain unresolved or have even worsened in some respects, which means greater political tension and potential for crises; on the other hand revolutionary change is notoriously difficult to manage which is why no developed country has so far attempted to grasp that particular nettle.",1412704769

What about compilers for dynamic languages which reason about type, like that if the program calls (symbol-name x), it is inferred that x must hold a string, so that a subsequent (cos x) is inconsistent?  Is such a compiler is reasoning about something which has nothing to do with static type?",1412704762

You may disagree, and clearly we can still get work done in the language, but IMHO Lua is suboptimally small, and the local maxima for &quot;tiny yet useful&quot; languages would have a lot more in the standard library and a few &quot;blessed&quot; tools to boot. A language with the goal of implementing in the standard library everything trivial, fungible (one chdir wrapper is as good as any other), useful for most users, and portable across major desktop and mobile OSes (embedded users will know if they don&#x27;t have e.g. a filesystem) would be a lot more useful yet probably not meaningfully larger than the existing implementations of Lua.

Left-to-right is a very useful, general, and systematic approach to do that, but there are faster ways depending on context. You can analogize it to programming in that you can trade CPU (left-to-right) for memory (cached tables of differences) to arrive at an optimal algorithm for the problem at hand.<p>So I would just re-iterate that learning these techniques isn&#x27;t simply for the sake of doing arithmetic faster in your head.

Here, the trick ended up relying on the casino enabling the Double Up option on request. There was a story making the rounds a few months ago on HN about a famous poker player who took a casino for millions of dollars (playing a different game) by relying on a subtle asymmetry in the back sides of their cards, and that scheme required the casino to cooperate by providing a dealer who spoke Mandarin and allowed the cards to be turned around ahead of time.<p>I wonder why casinos don&#x27;t just refuse <i>any</i> sort of unusual request related to the game. Sure, it <i>sounds</i> like an innocent request that won&#x27;t affect the payout. But how sure are you about that? Wouldn&#x27;t it be safer to just set the rules and never change them on request?<p>I assume the answer is ultimately that legitimate high-rollers sometimes have crazy requests, and you make more money from accommodating them than you lose from cheaters.

I do think that it makes sense for &quot;computer tresspass&quot; to be punished more harshly than tresspass to physical property. It takes a lot more effort to break into a server than it does to walk through someone&#x27;s door (or into their yard), so I think the baseline level of culpability is higher (though bear in mind that these are generalizations). There is also a lot more risk involved in a &quot;casual&quot; computer tresspass.

There are very few people who have ever actually been sentenced to the maximum CFAA penalty. (I&#x27;m actually aware of none.) The actual punishments actually imposed are often, I think, fairly reasonable.<p>Of course, there are plenty who have been threatened with the huge maximum by federal prosecutors, but this is no different from any other crime. Of course federal prosecutors will menace defendants with the maximum possible penalty. They want to extract a guilty plea, and it would also be dangerous for them to claim that any shorter penalty than the maximum applied, since they do no actually control sentencing. (Imagine the controversy if the U.S. Attorney told a defendant that he was only realistically looking at 6 months but the judge gave him 2 years.) It&#x27;s the defense attorney&#x27;s role to make sure that her client has a realistic understanding of the likely punishment, not the government&#x27;s.<p>What&#x27;s really needed is a replacement for CFAA (and, for that matter, most other criminal statutes) with more carefully graded maximum sentences, but I&#x27;ve never heard a realistic proposal about how such a law would work.",1412702729

As many good points as there are in the article (and there are many), the whole thing is &quot;No True Scotsman&quot; itself.<p>Any attempt to fuse aspects of other languages or paradigms with OOP in order to mitigate the listed problems are dismissed as &quot;not OOP&quot; to serve the purpose of illustrating that OOP sucks.<p>My experience is that <i>any</i> pure paradigm has limited context in which it&#x27;s ideal and many pitfalls outside that context. OOP is no different. Foolish adherence to consistency, hobgoblin of little minds, etc.<p>Where I will agree, at least in spirit, is that OOP has a few different aspects, including the implementation in a given language, the current understanding of best practices for a given context, and the cult of context-independent &quot;design correctness&quot;. That last one has major issues.<p>When the cult drives the implementation, you get high-ceremony languages like Java. And when the cult drives best practices, you get maintenance issues like those currently being acknowledged around invasive unit testing, etc.<p>The key there isn&#x27;t the design paradigm, IMO, but the fallacy of trying to apply a best practice without understanding why it&#x27;s useful or analyzing whether it&#x27;s the right thing to do for the current situation.<p>An analogy would be normalizing a relational database. There&#x27;s a &quot;correct way&quot; to do it, which in theory reduces maintenance if you go to third+ normal form. In practice, knowing when to relax normalization is the difference between success and a mess. So goes DRY, SOLID, etc.",1412702427

The machines only hold so much coin, so we kept having to have the attendent call to get the machine filled.

This really spooked us so we eventually took off.<p>The four of us came in two cars so when my one friend was dropping me off at my house, we looked at other, and then took off back to the casino. When we got there there was someone else playing the machine; doing what we were doing but at a smaller scale.

8422339,comment,8421866,8422139,0,0,forrestbthomas,,,"Thanks so much for the interest and the questions. You are correct in that the web-workers repo is related. Its the repo we use on the back end. To answer your questions in turn: 
&quot;How are you isolating the brains from the sensitive game data and from each other?&quot;
  - We are sandboxing each user&#x27;s code in an isolated environment where a server listens for a POST request on a specified endpoint. That request carries the game data with it and after the user&#x27;s code runs, the server sends back the result of that function, which is supposed to be a string (North, East, South, West, or Stay). The game data itself is update on our server, after receiving the response.
&quot;How long does a single game take to run given max users?&quot; The games will take a maximum of 24 users, which will take a maximum of 30 minutes to run, if every user does something like &quot;while(true).&quot; Each server has a max-timeout setting of around 2 seconds. 
I hope that answers your questions and please feel free to offer any feedback. 
Thanks again!",1412701507

8422319,comment,8420309,8420526,0,0,drostie,,,"> I&#x27;m still on the hedge about it. Yes, it&#x27;s more relate-able and inspiring, but it isn&#x27;t really a contribution to physics as much as engineering.<p>You need to understand a bit more of the context then, which is: the Nobel prize is paid from the interest accumulated by Alfred Nobel&#x27;s fortune, which is invested in bonds. Alfred Nobel got his fortune by, among other investments, inventing dynamite. Dynamite was not a breakthrough &quot;new idea&quot; -- the explosive in it was nitroglycerin. The short version of the story is that a nitroglycerin explosion killed Alfred Nobel&#x27;s brother, and it was being banned everywhere in general due to accidents, because explosion can be triggered by physical shocks. Nobel reasoned that it could be made much safer if it couldn&#x27;t move around so much, and so he ordered a bunch of a locally-abundant porous rock substance and soaked that in the nitroglycerin (we would now say that the &quot;diatomaceous earth&quot; acts as a &quot;stabilizer&quot;). He patented that combination and sold it as stronger and safer than gunpowder for blasting, and it sold like hotcakes.<p>Due in part to this history, the Nobel in physics is seldom awarded for a theoretical breakthrough alone. Hawking&#x27;s work on black hole radiation has changed theoretical physics and cosmology immensely, but we haven&#x27;t <i>observed it</i> coming off of a known black hole, so he&#x27;s widely viewed as ineligible for a Nobel prize.<p>Similarly the discovery of graphene was not issued for the work done on it in the 1940s, 50s, 60s and 70s -- it was given for work done in the early 2000s which allowed a lot of graphene to be made cheaply: it turns out you can use scotch tape on a block of graphite to tear off a bunch of stuff, some of which is individual layers of graphene; it helps to fold the tape on itself over and over to try to get more and more little &quot;islands&quot; of it since individual monolayer chunks are super-rare. The key aspect of their work, less-reported in the news but essential, is that those &quot;islands&quot; of graphene have a certain iridescence to them when they&#x27;re on the right sort of backdrop (a sheet of 300nm-thick silicon dioxide), so that you can see them with an optical microscope.<p>There&#x27;s two parts to it: game-changing technology. It&#x27;s not enough to be theoretically right. In Einstein&#x27;s Nobel presentation speech, they breeze through relativity with &quot;this pertains essentially to epistemology,&quot; and they make a little mention to his huge contribution to the burgeoning field of colloid chemistry (which ultimately proves that atoms really exist and gives you a way to measure how big they are). Instead they go straight to his quantum work: his explanation of the photoelectric effect and his explanation of why the specific heat of metals is about 3R, where R is the gas constant. He wins because he kicked off the field of quantum photochemistry, which was suddenly making lots and lots of strides in understanding the world; and because his photoelectric laws were &quot;extremely rigorously tested by the American Millikan and his pupils and passed the test brilliantly&quot;.<p>Seen in that light, the Blue-LED discovery (how to grow GaN crystals) which opens the way to all colors of LEDs and all sorts of gallium nitride tech, is actually pretty much exactly a Nobel discovery. For example, in my Master&#x27;s program we would talk about experiments on a 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), and the physics thereof. The stock example was AlGaAs/GaAs (the LED material for red/green LEDs, gallium arsenide with a layer of aluminum-gallium arsenide) where they were first observed. But, there was a bit of interesting discussion as well about doing the same with AlGaN/GaN, which has a higher band-gap and, if I recall correctly, needs less (no?) doping to do interesting things.",1412701308

    travel to India to visit relatives during the virus&#x27;s

Not many things are better than learning useful stuff. check profile for age<p>At 16, I probably would have said the same thing, but only 5 years later, I'd advise you that there's no rush. There is really a lot of time in life to be great at <i>useful</i> stuff and learn a great many things on the side. My idea of enjoying life in college was falling in love, traveling, and taking poetry classes. If I could do it again, I'd replace my CS classes with drama and a foreign language (studying abroad), and spend free time learning CS on my own. (I'd keep the Math major for the mental rigor)<p>There is nothing in a CS class you can't get out of a book/working on OSS projects, but a lot more you can learn about life with a good acting, literature, or history class than you'll have time to for most of your life afterward.",1213426580

217414,comment,216760,216760,0,0,keefe,,,"Back in grad school when I was working on papers, it seemed pretty essential to have an experience PhD involved in the process. No matter how ""great"" the idea I had, there were always a lot of complications. For example, making sure I had the appropriate literature review done, did controlled comparisons against best of breed algorithms etc. I would write an abstract of your improvements with hard numbers and the conclusions that you draw from them and also a 2 page summary explaining all this, and email it to a friendly applied mathematician.",1213425265

217412,comment,216960,217155,0,0,arn,,,"I disagree with this.  A site like this isn't getting the bulk of their search traffic to their homepage.  They have thousands of minor pages indexed for search terms that only a handful of people search for.  Multiply this by 10,000 and you get their search traffic (long tail, blah blah blah)  There's no ""one page"" that if there's a large rank drop will affect.<p>Note, this is very different than, for example, an e-commerce site that sells ""widgets"", and is ranking very well for the word ""widgets"".  For them, a ranking drop could be devastating.<p>Now, that being said, they are dependent on Google for the bulk of their income... but there are worse things than tying your fortunes to Google's financial well being.",1213424747

It's a mindbender, plus you get to hang out with Gerry Sussman.<p>Pretty much every lecture is spent examining a different programming approach and demonstrating that it's either trivially implemented in Scheme, more elegantly implemented in Scheme, or actually not worth implementing in the first place.",1213423664

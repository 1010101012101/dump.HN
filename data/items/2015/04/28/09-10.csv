9451226,comment,9451112,9451112,0,0,kolme,,,"This is terrible. So Google is trying to get out of the monopoly accusations by bribing the mainstream media. They will make a deal and Google will get its monopole, and the media too.<p>I don&#x27;t know if anyone here heard about the &quot;Google tax&quot; in Spain [1], but here are my worst fears: Google will consolidate its monopole, and the mainstream press too.<p>Here&#x27;s how it went in Spain. One could go to Google News to get a glance of the news. One could find mainstream press there, international or otherwise, alongside with independent media and bloggers.<p>So the government in Spain (or, actually, the media lobby?) creates a law tailored to tax Google, and Google just cancels the service. How did that turn out?<p>People go now directly to the mainstream media sites, and independent media are now completely out of the game. Mainstream papers lost some readers, but made the competency almost invisible in the process.<p>If this trend goes on, and Google and the mainstream media make &quot;peace deals&quot;, it means the same big players as always will get a monopoly on Google services, while Google will secure popular contents for their own services (Google News, Android News widgets, and so on).<p>We all lose in media plurality and independence. In the future we will be worse informed.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_tax"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_tax</a>",1430215161

I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not just Americans, but Americans in particular really do often look completely oblivious to the opinions, usages, general culture and way of life of the other, non-American people they encounter abroad. <i>Edit</i>: just look at the other posts in this discussion, talking about &quot;the first amendment&quot; when the whole story had nothing to do with the US at all (the UK, and presumably Tristan as well, don&#x27;t have anything close to a law safeguarding free speech).<p>Maybe just because they make up a large amount of the tourists in the world, and therefore also a large part of the oblivious tourists as well.<p>When tourists showed up on Kerguelen island (which isn&#x27;t comparable to Tristan as the population isn&#x27;t permanent, but those who stay there for a full year are indeed the ephemeral natives of the place) it was always the Americans that were full of themselves, had their weird expectations and got angry when we couldn&#x27;t get them fizzy water, or anything fizzy but not Orangina, or &quot;ok just get me a beer right... wait, no not this shitty French beer&quot;. Or who wanted to touch the albatross chicks. Or bring home a gentoo egg. Or... &quot;who are you to tell me not to do that? Call your manager right now.&quot;<p>Somehow even French government officials, for all their disconnectedness and abuse of the limited resources not intended for them, or most other foreign tourists, could at least get a sense of the place, and understanding of the people, at the very worst they were aware that they did not understand everything.<p>Wow, this is sounding very anti-American now that I&#x27;m reading this again. But my experience of tourists on a few remote islands really taught me that Americans often seem completely unprepared to meet places and people that aren&#x27;t either America and American, or completely devoted to catering to their every wish and expectation.<p>You don&#x27;t have to understand <i>why</i> people think differently than you do. But when they do and you are their guest, just listen to them and accept that they are different people in a different place, with different rules and different means. It&#x27;s easy for me to understand how one guy could turn the few hundred inhabitants of his island against one foreigner.",1430214218

The message is handed off to N replicas, and efforts are made to avoid duplicated or dropped messages. Disque will refuse new messages if RAM is filled across the cluster.<p>- nsq: send to any. Read from all. NSQ nodes do not communicate or coordinate with each other. Since only one node originates the message, there&#x27;s no duplication, but a node outage can drop messages, and a partition can isolate them with no consumer. NSQ can grow its queue beyond RAM, so it will keep accepting new messages even if it is partitioned from the consumer.<p>Personally I think NSQ&#x27;s approach looks like it&#x27;s doing a lot less work and achieving almost all the same guarantees.",1430214134

A lot of interesting &quot;design&quot; has happened for a long time after that invention, separated by divergence.<p>Cephalopods are very distantly related to us. Our last common ancestor with cephalopods is also our last common ancestor with  slugs and hookworms. Yet many species are obviously highly intelligent. Their intelligence seems to work very differently from vertebrate intelligence.<p>So, it&#x27;s interesting thing that some descendant species of whoever invented brains opted out. But either way some sort of convergence <i>did</i> happen. Maybe brains evolved twice. Maybe they evolved many times from a common primitive nerve bundle that performed a very different function. Maybe this happened in a tangle of back and forth.<p>The aye-aye lemur and the striped possum both evolved a long bug catching finger. We know that it&#x27;s convergent rather than common ancestry because (among lots of reasons, but this is a neat example) it&#x27;s a different finger. But, they both had fingers to elongate in the first place. So, given the same machinery to evolve and the availability of similar ecological niches (no woodpeckers, lots of bugs) they came up with a smiler solution.<p>We know that brains, and their components are very flexible even in a mature organism. So it makes sense that evolution is wild and creative, repurposing the tool constantly. I mean the diversity in sense perception in different animals seems like evidence of radically evolving brains over relatively short periods of time. Even entirely new senses (eg echolocation) seem to evolve fairly easily and quickly.<p>TLDR: depending on what your precise definition of &quot;brain&quot; is, this seems very likely. Aye-ayes & striped possums both have elongated fingers that evolved separately from regular fingers.

9451163,comment,9450806,9450806,0,0,userbinator,,,"I can make two observations and hypotheses from the profiling results, which agree with Linus&#x27; conclusion of &quot;bad user-level code&quot;:<p>- Memory allocation/deallocation are taking the most time.<p>- All the percentages for each function are very small.<p>The former is a characteristic of code which heavily abuses dynamic allocation. It&#x27;s surprising to see how many programmers are not aware of the overhead it adds and would malloc()/free() frivolously when something simpler would suffice. This is also often accompanied by copious amounts of unnecessarily copying data around. I&#x27;ve worked with small embedded systems where every use of dynamic allocation would need to be justified thoroughly in code reviews; perhaps these developers would benefit from being put through the same process.<p>The latter is a phenomenon which arises from &quot;excessive modularity&quot;: the functionality of the system has been split into so many little pieces that the time each function contributes to the overall total is tiny. Instead of seeing an obvious &quot;80% of the time is being spent here&quot; that could easily be targeted for optimisation, that 80% is scattered amongst several dozen functions each taking 1-2% each. The bottleneck isn&#x27;t concentrated in one area --- the whole system is uniformly inefficient. It&#x27;s extremely difficult to optimise a system like this because nothing in particular stands out as being optimisable. I&#x27;ve had to optimise some large Java applications that were like this, and the solution was basically to remove most of the code and rewrite it to get rid of many chains of indirection.",1430213337

For a long time, you&#x27;ve been able to attach a file descriptor (e.g. one end of a pipe) to a message, and then send bulk data over the file descriptor.<p>My understanding of this whole thing was that most of the car companies thought they should try using linux for their console / entertainment / etc systems. Electrical and mechanical engineers seem to all only use windows and not know anything about linux, so they asked themselves &quot;what&#x27;s the bus on linux?&quot; and found D-bus, the desktop bus used by desktop environments and utilities, for a handful of messages a minute.<p>They used it to send frequent sensor data to all sorts of services that might be interested, like digital gauges, sound distribution, etc. They didn&#x27;t realize that there are lots of good low-level IPC mechanisms available on linux, and they should have probably used 0mq, or a scheme based on unix sockets with filesystem permissions based access control, etc.<p>Anyway, they realized that D-bus had way too much overhead, and instead of porting to some other IPC, got to work accelerating D-bus with additional kernel functionality, such as the AF_BUS which was rejected by the linux networking maintainers.

I just use shm_open()+mmap(MAP_SHARED) and go about sharing my data between processes, and have had no problems whatsoever. Then throw in sem_open() so only one process is locking the data at a time. Wrap all that in a 2KB header and it&#x27;s trivial to use in any project.<p>It would seem that modern computing is all about building abstractions on top of abstractions, to solve &#x27;problems&#x27; nobody ever had. Nobody ever seems to consider the <i>costs</i> of such complexity (in terms of maintenance, understanding the system as a whole, attack vectors, etc.)<p>By all means, if you need a super complex system with tons of features like D-bus, great! But I am pretty confident that Mousepad (Xfce text editor) doesn&#x27;t need D-bus just to open a text file in a new tab of an existing window.",1430212035

I don&#x27;t know of a way on Linux or OSX to embed a word processor to work on documents but never show the user (but this might be due to my lack of knowledge about those systems - I would welcome being enlightened). I once wrote something that processed a plethora of Word documents using Word via COM to extract data from them and shove it into a database.<p>I can&#x27;t fully remember how I did it but I recall type libraries, including generated headers etc. but I remember being impressed by it.<p>And as you state, all calls within Windows rely on COM.

There was a spring that fed a collection tank through some pipes under agricultural land, we guessed that a tractor had squashed the pipes somewhere along their length. A backhoe was booked for the following day so it didn&#x27;t really matter whether we got any results or not but we decided to try dowsing to see if we could work out the path of the pipes, just for a bit of fun more than expecting it to really work.<p>We used some bent aluminium rods and walked about a bit in the field sticking twigs into the ground wherever the rods moved. This worked for some family members, not for others. The next day the backhoe dug out the old wooden pipes and they were exactly underneath where we had placed the twigs on the surface but several feet down.",1430211795

1077930,comment,1077548,1077548,0,0,cwan,,,"While I can appreciate this as a ""hack"" to get stuff done in India, it seems a bit unnecessary.  As others note, the reason why this works is that it's an implicit threat.<p>The better alternative is to address the underlying reasons for a lot of the corruption - and that's excessive regulation and costs to register and conform with the law.  There's been a lot of work in this area with respect to legal versus off the books capital (e.g. Mystery of Capital by Hernando De Soto).  You can quite easily see the plight of the entrepreneur/individual by looking at the World Bank's Doing Business reports - here's India's - <a href=""http://doingbusiness.org/ExploreEconomies/?economyid=89"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doingbusiness.org/ExploreEconomies/?economyid=89</a><p>e,g.: it takes 13 procedures and 30 days to formally start a business in India versus 6 procedures and 6 days in the US.<p>This obviously isn't just India either.  Most developing countries are like this.  It's through regulations and compliance that government officials can seek graft.  Streamlining has the effect of not only reducing corruption but making any form of transaction with the state far more efficient resulting in higher growth (there's a positive relationship between GDP growth and better rankings on the World Bank's doing business index).",1264521574

1077895,comment,1077754,1077754,0,0,Silhouette,,,"It seems to me that the biggest problem is not software architecture <i>per se</i>, it's when you have a software architect who thinks they are automatically senior to other members of the team. Software architects are (or at least, IMHO, should be) co-ordinators, not directors/dictators.<p>Of course architects need to be technically strong, because they need to be working with the team leads responsible for each part of the software project. That means they need to be able to communicate effectively with those leads and understand the technical implications of what is being said.<p>But it's a two-way street, and both the team leads and the architects have their own role to play. The team lead needs to be more aware of the finer details going on in their area of the project. The architect doesn't need to know those things, but does need to be aware of how everything fits together. That includes knowing enough about what each individual team is doing to identify areas where something new would be useful, or where multiple teams are doing the same thing and there is redundancy that could be eliminated.<p>Ultimately, it's all about collaboration. A software architect who only draws diagrams and produces hundred-page design documents probably isn't very useful. A software architect who talks to business leaders to clarify the requirements, liaises between the various development teams to make sure that they collectively meet those requirements, keeps an eye on testing and on bug reports coming in from the field, and so on, is pretty much essential to building large software systems successfully IME.<p>(Edit: I realise that my final description there was rather broad, and has some overlap with management responsibilities. Realistically, I think a software architect is going to have an element of that as part of their role, just as team leads do within their particular areas. But both are primarily technical roles.)",1264520894

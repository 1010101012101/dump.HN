3100921,comment,3098224,3099871,3,0,anamax,,,"> That might be the RNC's talking points of how insurance works, but given that I'm in the industry, I can tell you that insurance exists to offset risk by spreading costs over a pool of people.<p>Both insurance and subsidies (as I described them) spread risks over a pool.  The difference is in how we charge folks in the pool.<p>If we charge them by their expected cost, it's insurance.  If we charge some people significantly more than their expected cost so we can charge others less, the first group is subsidizing the second.<p>And no, the fact that I don't have a claim doesn't imply that I'm subsidizing anyone any more than the fact that someone hits the lottery implies that lotteries are a good bet.  The relevant question is how my cost of ""insurance"" compares to my expected claims.<p>There is value in reducing variance - I'd rather pay $600/year for 10 years instead of paying $5800 one year and nothing for 9 years.  And, I'm willing to take the chance that I'd never pay anything to avoid the hit of paying $5800 twice and nothing 8 times.  (In this example, I'm paying $200 so I'm not subject to variance.)<p>However, I'm a lot less willing to pay $600/year if I think that my expected costs are $1k once every 10 years.  That's the problem with subsidies disguised as ""insurance"".  The rational response is to try to get out of the pool.<p>> Premium is a factor of the risk analysis, not a transaction fee.<p>I didn't refer to insurance premiums, I referred to the fact that maintaining a pool has costs which the payments must cover in addition to the losses.<p>> The larger the pool, the less the risk, the cheaper the average premium.<p>That's simply not true.  My risk of having a car accident does not depend on how many people are in ""the pool"".  There can be economies of scale in the costs of maintaining the pool, but they have nothing to do with risk.<p>> if you are against the concept of national insurance programs as a principle, you should really evaluate your view of insurance in general, since you're ""subsidizing"" people who crash their cars, have house fires, pick the wrong banks etc, etc.<p>I'm not against insurance.  However, subsidies have issues and it is dishonest to claim otherwise and confuse the two.",1318376666

3100906,comment,3100107,3100851,2,0,rayiner,,,"Dart never really behaves like a statically-typed language. Take this code: <a href=""http://try-dart-lang.appspot.com/s/bA0X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://try-dart-lang.appspot.com/s/bA0X</a><p>It not only doesn't give an error, but it runs just fine. main() passes ""cake"" to bar(), which passes ""cake3"" to foo(), because String overloads the + operator to coerce its RHS to a string before concatenating. foo() ends up receiving a string despite being declared as receiving a number, but does what one would expect because '+' is defined for strings as well as numbers.<p>The compiler does not complain because it does not try to unify types globally. It does not care that bar(), which is declared as taking any type then passes that to foo() which is declared as taking a number.<p>If you change the 'var' in the declaration of bar() to 'num' you will indeed get a type error in main() when it tries to pass bar() a string.<p>So making types non-nullable in Dart would have little utility. Dart can't statically ensure that a variable declared as 'num' doesn't end up being a 'String' at run time, much less ensure that a variable is non-null.<p>I don't see this as a weakness of Dart. The point of Dart's optional types is to enforce some structure, provide documentation, and avoid obvious mistakes in an otherwise dynamically typed language. Statically enforcing invariants like non-nulity is really beyond its scope.",1318376331

We monitor every drive in every pod in our datacenter with the smartmontools (/usr/sbin/smartctl) which includes the temperature of the drives.  The drives stay well within their recommended operating temperatures as long as the fans are running.  In the past, we have detected that several fans failed in one single pod when alarms went off saying some drives were running hot, so the fans are working (normally) and the air is flowing.  Side note: personally I think it's really awesome that consumer grade drives come with such detailed internal monitoring for free.  I also think it is disappointing that desktop consumer OS's don't monitor these things BY DEFAULT and popup dialogs explaining to you when your drive is exhibiting high temperatures or high data loss!",1318375810

The Go language sort of has this via interface types.  Consider the following:<p><pre><code>    type Foo struct { a, b int }\n\n    func Bar(x interface{}) Foo {\n        if f, ok := x.(Foo); ok {\n            return f // x is a Foo at runtime so return it\n        }\n        return Foo{0, 1}\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThere is no need for the Foo type to have a null value.

I'm just saying, it's <i>much</i> easier to design a system where hardware failures cause downtime, and where that downtime is made acceptable because hardware with redundant drives doesn't fail that often than it is to design a system where hardware failures don't cause downtime (and where a failed hard drive causes a full node failure)<p>Thus, to someone who isn't at scale, the supermicro systems are likely going to be cheaper, overall, than the backblaze pods.  (It sounds like these people paid more per disk for the backblaze pods than I'm going to pay for the supermicro pods anyhow.)",1318374674

HTML doesn't have the immediate feedback of ""I can write something that makes my life better"" in the same way that, for example, Python does. Python lets you write something you can use for your benefit six months in. Something that will actually save you significant amounts of time in some cases. There is a power and a promise there that I don't see being matched in HTML. HTML is made firstly for others to view on browsers, while the first Python script you write can be done just to make your life easier.

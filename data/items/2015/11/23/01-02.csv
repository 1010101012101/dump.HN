I&#x27;m not telling you to get rid of your lawn, but the concept as it exists now and it&#x27;s popularization is at best wasteful, and in some cases actively causes problems with water availability in some areas.  Some reform in the popularized concept of a front lawn would be beneficial to everyone.",1448243973

The web wasn&#x27;t designed ahead of time for all the uses it has today, it&#x27;s evolved into its current role, and often by developers forcing it to do their bidding. It&#x27;s also not defined by any single entity and the standards process takes a long time.<p>Of course something that started as an application framework would have had &quot;subroutines&quot; and custom components. That&#x27;s no reason to deride the efforts to address that now.<p>As for requiring JS, you are correct. A declarative custom element standard will be needed before we can have extensible HTML without script. But given that a declarative standard will be a subset, in term of power, of the imperative API, it&#x27;s best to see what the most common used parts of the imperative API are before baking defining the declarative version. If you look up initial versions of MDV and web components, you&#x27;ll see declarative elements in there.",1448243904

You want to be in a situation where you&#x27;ve already identified some features you need to deliver and you already have a pretty good idea about how they&#x27;ll be delivered and how they fit into the architecture etc.<p>That &quot;how to/thinking&quot; stage is just background processing that happens all the time.  It shouldn&#x27;t be counted in the burndown.  That background processing could consume anything between 100% of the time in a project that is just getting kicked off and 20% of the time in a more mature project.<p>Every now and then a problem might come along that requires more serious thought.  But to just have the entire team go and think about it for months is very rarely the right thing to do.  You just put it on the back burner.  If there&#x27;s some urgency then you just think quickly and accept the fact that the solution is very unlikely to be perfect.<p>Regardless of process or how management is trying to drive people you need some mix of stuff that gets done and thinking about what else needs to be done and where to steer the overall project towards.  These really have to happen somewhat concurrently since you want to get feedback on your ideas as soon as reasonably possible.  Every situation is different in terms of the time scale and what this mix looks like.  Whatever the buzzword of the day bad management will find a way to abuse it.  Agile was supposed to be a way of avoiding that but the forces it tries to fight are too strong.<p>EDIT (more thoughts).<p>If you&#x27;ve thought about architecture and how features work and are implemented than tracking burn-down can indeed give you some insight about the actual progress being made.  It&#x27;s just a visual way of seeing how close you are to where you thought you&#x27;d be.  There are a lot of things that need to happen though for this to really work.  You need to have done the thinking.  You need to be reasonably good at estimation.  You need to be reasonably good at planning the work out.  The team needs to understand what &quot;done&quot; actually means.  The process shouldn&#x27;t be abused by management (which I think is the complaint?).<p>I&#x27;ve seen this work.  I&#x27;ve seen &quot;smooth&quot; work reflected as smooth burn down charts and I&#x27;ve seen &quot;oops, unexpected trouble&quot; show charts where nothing is burnt.  That early visibility is supposed to help steer the project.  I&#x27;ve seen projects with no such visibility go through 2 years and find out very close to the end that they&#x27;re really a year late and the project will take 3 years.  It&#x27;s not that something unexpected happened after a year and 11 months.  It&#x27;s just that people weren&#x27;t paying attention and were being optimistic they would somehow magically catch up.",1448242670

10612346,comment,10610471,10610704,0,0,MarkMc,,,"This is an excellent question because it allows the student to demonstrate an understanding that (a) digits have different &#x27;meaning&#x27; depending on the context - the 5 &#x27;means 500&#x27; and the 8 &#x27;means 80&#x27;; and (b) there is a difference between replying with a true statement and answering correctly.<p>Bobby has made a true statement that is related to the question, but hasn&#x27;t completely answered the question.  The correct is that the value of 5 in 582 is 500, and an even better answer would be &quot;the value of 5 in 582 is 500 because the 5 is in the hundreds place&quot;.<p>This distinction is something that many teachers overlook.  There is an excellent handbook for teachers called &quot;Teach Like A Champion&quot; [1] which emphasises that &quot;Right is Right&quot; - here is an excerpt:<p>---------------------------------<p>Right Is Right is about the difference between partially right and all-the-way right—between pretty good and 100 percent. The job of the teacher is to set a high standard for correctness: 100 percent. The likelihood is strong that students will stop striving when they hear the word right (or yes or some other proxy), so there&#x27;s a real risk to naming as right that which is not truly and completely right. When you sign off and tell a student she is right, she must not be betrayed into thinking she can do something that she Cannot.<p>Many teachers respond to almost-correct answers their students give in class by rounding up. That is they&#x27;ll affirm the student&#x27;s answer and repeat it, adding some detail of their own to make it fully correct even though the student didn&#x27;t provide (and may not recognize) the differentiating factor. Imagine a student who&#x27;s asked at the beginning of Romeo and Juliet how the Capulets and Montagues get along. “They don&#x27;t like each other,” the student might say, in an answer that most teachers would, I hope, want some elaboration on before they called it fully correct. “Right,” the teacher might reply. “They don&#x27;t like each other, and they have been feuding for generations.” But of course the student hadn&#x27;t included the additional detail. That&#x27;s the “rounding up.” Sometimes the teacher will even give the student credit for the rounding up as if the student said what he did not and what she merely wished he&#x27;d said, as in, “Right, what Kiley said was that they don&#x27;t like each other and have been feuding. Good work, Kiley.” Either way, the teacher has set a low standard for correctness and explicitly told the class that they can be right even when they are not. Just as important, she has crowded out students&#x27; own thinking, doing cognitive work that students could do themselves (e.g., “So, is this a recent thing? A temporary thing? Who can build on Kiley&#x27;s answer?”).<p>When answers are almost correct, it&#x27;s important to tell students that they&#x27;re almost there, that you like what they&#x27;ve done so far, that they&#x27;re closing in on the right answer, that they&#x27;ve done some good work or made a great start. You can repeat a student&#x27;s answer back to him so he can listen for what&#x27;s missing and further correct—for example, “You said the Capulets and the Montagues didn&#x27;t get along.” Or you can wait or prod or encourage or cajole in other ways to tell students what still needs doing, ask who can help get the class all the way there until you get students all the way to a version of right that&#x27;s rigorous enough to be college prep: “Kiley, you said the Capulets and the Montagues didn&#x27;t get along. Does that really capture their relationship? Does that sound like what they&#x27;d say about each other?”<p>In holding out for right, you set the expectation that the questions you ask and their answers truly matter. You show that you believe your students are capable of getting answers as right as students anywhere else. You show the difference between the facile and the scholarly. This faith in the quality of a right answer sends a powerful message to your students that will guide them long after they have left your classroom.<p>----------------------------------------<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118901851"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118901851</a>",1448242115

I rarely work longer hours in that set-up, and all those early parts of the curve where it looks like things aren&#x27;t being completed -- that part is usually where I am the most productive.<p>I spend the first while reading, researching, drawing pictures, and just generally <i>thinking</i> about the problem. The idea of even caring at all about closing a ticket or issue at the early stage doesn&#x27;t cross my mind. It&#x27;s too soon. Zero tickets should be closing. You haven&#x27;t thought hard enough yet. This applies equally well in a two-week time frame as in a multi-month pilot or prototype research phase.<p>Later on, I am reaping the rewards of the compounded growth of the thinking and ruminating that I did. I can close issues way faster than normal (without working longer hours, without exhausting myself, and without introducing dangerous bugs). This is because I took the time to actually <i>think</i> about what I was doing. I didn&#x27;t let the false productivity of merely closing tickets or issues (i.e. stupid bullshit overhead that I enter into a stupid bullshit tracking system) get in the way of actually doing my job (which is to <i>think</i> first and act on that thinking later).<p>The fact that these graphs tend to converge, naturally, to the &quot;cliff&quot; scenario should be a big signal to people that that&#x27;s what humans do. That&#x27;s how they work. Humans produce solutions to hard knowledge problems in a way that is like a Poisson process. After &quot;integrating&quot; on the problem for a while, a solution &quot;discharges&quot; like a lightning strike, based on the compounded growth of your investment into actually thinking, instead of prematurely trying to do something just for appearances sake.<p>This is relatively more true for &quot;research&quot; problems, where you can have a chance encounter with something that suddenly makes the problem way harder than anyone thought, as opposed to what some people seem to think are &quot;mere implementation&quot; problems, but the effect still happens in both cases. And even more, &quot;mere implementation&quot; problems usually aren&#x27;t. Usually those too involve research time regarding refactoring and design ramifications of the implementation.<p>This is among the fundamental reasons why I disagree with the premise of modern Agile-like techniques. They take a view that fundamentally, all of the tasks within a given cycle are roughly fungible and commodity work. Management seems to think that it&#x27;s somehow a managerial task to &quot;drive&quot; workers into situations where they produce linear-like burndown. Instead of stopping and saying, wait, we should be figuring out how people work and then setting up the stream of business needs so that it gets satisfied by the way people work. <i>Not</i> saying that you have some preconceived idea of how the business needs have to be satisfied (usually because it would be politically convenient for you if it could be true), and then seeking to implement that regardless of what human beings do when they work.<p>Anyway, in a sense it depresses me that this kind of burndown bullshit has been so erroneously legitimized by middle management in bureaucratic organizations that we now actually have to spend even more brain cycles debating exactly what shape the burndown graph should have. Total bikeshedding loss for us all. Why not just not have burndown and stop pretending like keeping one&#x27;s finger on the pulse of ticket-closure-velocity has any relationship to the real world aside from whatever one can politically sell to one&#x27;s boss?",1448241345

Most critically, it&#x27;s not a direct relationship. If you double the number of pieces in your infrastructure, your problems become four times as hard if not more.<p>You might have a database and a web app. But the database gets slow, so you add a caching layer. Then you need to scale up to accomodate more users. You&#x27;ve got to be able to back up all your users&#x27; data. And when your app gets complicated, deployments can break things, so you also need to be able to roll back quickly. Once you have a dozen or more servers going, you realize that if one goes down everything breaks, so you have to add redundancy to each part of the system, which adds even more concerns about how backups and recovery is handled. Then you need to add some search features to your growing dataset, which necessitates another kind of database to index your primary database, and more app servers. Oh, and by this point when things break, it becomes really hard to tell why things are broken, so you need monitoring and centralized logging, and whoops, those are two more kinds of databases and the associated web applications to manage them. And when you&#x27;re at this scale, you have to coordinate multiple pieces of the system for any change you make, so you have additional software to manage that.

We don&#x27;t have homomorphic encryption yet, so right now if you dump a VM you own any secrets it holds.

We shouldn&#x27;t give them a pass just because they are large <i>because</i> that one wizard guy is required, and security problems need to go to the <i>top</i> of his pile, not somewhere in the middle or at the end.<p>I&#x27;m not saying these companies need to magically become less bloated, but they <i>do</i> need fix security problems with the urgency they require.  If that means that we all need to make a stink so it starts actually seeming important to them, then so be it.  Another way to look at this is that they&#x27;ve reaped the benefit of having a web presence for years, but haven&#x27;t had to pay some of the associated costs (since they apparently don&#x27;t have the internal structure in place to review and/or fix these problems).  In that respect, they&#x27;ve been playing the odds for a long time and come out ahead (wittingly or not), but that doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t need to pay up when it bites them in the ass.",1448240498

A step is worth the same value for everyone - no matter who you are, or where you are. What matters is how much you walk.<p>Earning money mostly comes through creating value for others. (When it doesn&#x27;t, it comes from diverting value into your pockets.) Walking around is great, and I encourage everybody to do it. But pitching it as the &quot;freedom to make money&quot; is absurd. Talking as if random people walking around Africa can double their monthly income is obscene.<p>I can&#x27;t believe the BBC would publish that article, either. I understand the tech press is mostly toothless, but even so I can&#x27;t believe that such a hallucinatory scheme received only the mildest questioning.<p>I can&#x27;t wait for this bubble to be over.",1448240476

I suggest that what it does is send a signal to the market that watches are just like phones.<p>Which means, that they will take over all the functions that hitherto required more portability than offered by a phone. Maybe Apple Watch 3.0 will do it. Maybe Pebble. Maybe Swatch. Maybe a company we haven’t heard of yet.<p>But the Watch establishes that single-purpose wearables have to be extremely specialized to survive. I conjecture this drives consumers towards “safe” choices, companies they perceive to have good potential to survive the shakeout. And behind the scenes, it does the same thing to companies.<p>So I agree that there’s opportunity to compete with Apple Watch. But I am bearish on dedicated fitness trackers.",1448240473

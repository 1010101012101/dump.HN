And the cost of the parts has fallen along the same curve as most other electronics. A $40 dollar broadband module can pay for itself with one service call or critical alarm, depending on the context.",1262339862

Since they had asked for friends and families phone numbers I assumed they might be calling to verify my answers to questions or confirm I really had extended family in Tel Aviv.  An announcement played over the sound system, interrupting my break in the sunshine. First in Hebrew, then Arabic, then in English. It was something along the lines of, 'do not to be alarmed by gunshots because the Israeli security needs to blow up suspicious passanger luggage.'""<p>Perhaps not entirely standard procedure, but sounds like it's not an isolated incident.<p>While I agree with you that the comment could have been phrased more effectively, the reminder that this article portrays perhaps an overly rosy interpretation of Israel's security practices was helpful, at least to me.  It seemed odd it would be sitting at negative numbers just because someone didn't like the way it was phrased.",1262339621

I don't see how lexical scope applies.",1262339488

To my mind, a one-time fee for content strongly implies (by way of cultural expectation if nothing else) that I own rather than license that content.<p>On the other hand, for a subscription service such as Basecamp, my interactions with my data must necessarily be mediated by a server. I do of course expect a way to export the data itself should I wish to unsubscribe - and they provide this. What more could I reasonably expect from them?",1262338147

As someone pointed out in another comment, Telstra's standard price for off plan data is $2/Mb (for a consumer mobile, not a b2b contract which is presumably what the power company had).  For 90Gb of data that works out at $180,000, so pretty consistent with the reported cost.",1304463588

Death clears the old to make way for the new. In Hinduism and Buddhism, accepting death is a part of the path to enlightenment.

Meanwhile, all the current (lazy, inept, consumer-hostile, mediocre) bandwidth providers are going to try to fuck them out of the game.<p>So a big part of me wonders what Netflix is working on behind the scenes to secure their future from a bandwidth perspective. This is a company that has always been so proactive I have a hard time believing they're twiddling their thumbs and hoping that AT&T, Comcast and other telecom companies will be menschy guys.<p>What <i>could</i> they do? I know very little about large scale networking. Is there some supply-side critical path that a company like Comcast <i>needs</i> that Netflix could buy for leverage? On the consumer end, is it reasonable to imagine them reselling bandwidth to end-users under terms that favor their business, thus spurring competition?<p>Everyone who controls the consumer side of bandwidth seems to be an asshole of one flavor or another  perhaps Netflix's needs could align with consumers in such a way as to change that.",1304463462

And that, to anyone who is sensitive to romantic Quality, just makes it all the worse. Now it's not just depressingly dull, it's also phony. Put the two together and you get a pretty accurate basic description of modern American technology: stylized cars and stylized outboard motors and stylized typewriters and stylized clothes. Stylized refrigerators filled with stylized food in stylized kitchens in stylized homes. Plastic stylized toys for stylized children, who at Christmas and birthdays are in style with their stylish parents. You have to be awfully stylish yourself not to get sick of it once in a while. It's the style that gets you; technological ugliness syruped over with romantic phoniness in an effort to produce beauty and profit by people who, though stylish, don't know where to start because no one has ever told them there's such a thing as Quality in this world and it's real, not style. Quality isn't something you lay on top of subjects and objects like tinsel on a Christmas tree. Real Quality must be the source of the subjects and objects, the cone from which the tree must start.""",1304462964

At the same time, it also requires an understanding of previous era philosophers, since most philosophy is built on what was said earlier. Philosophy for the most part, evolves as ideas are built upon gradually by one philosopher after the next, so reading something from the middle and subscribing to it is pretty much baseless and akin to believing in some sort of cult ideology.<p>The more important part is to understand different arguments, and see which ones really stick out to you; the framework that you choose: metaphysical, analytical, phenomenological etc. should be something that truly inspires your way of thinking.",1304462540

My family spoke openly about the disdain for the gov't of Germany and what they made everyone go through and the tough choices that need to be made between their allegiance to their country and their allegiance to humanity.<p>I never got to speak to my Grandfather about the details of it how to juxtapose service for one's country but against humanity. Suffice it to say that my father refused Canadian citizenship because he felt the idea of swearing allegiance to a person (the Queen) was abhorrent and that no person should be regarded in that esteem. To swear allegiance to the Queen was to undermine every reason why my family left Germany. It was very difficult for me to sign my passport because I knew that to do so would be to bind myself to the Queen and the idea that not all men are created equal, but I also knew that after 9/11 I could never leave Canada with out doing so. So I swallowed my principles like my grandfather before me and went along with the system.<p>The lesson to me was you don't ally yourself to a country, you ally yourself to humanity.<p>My father also spoke of the generosity of American soldiers and giving him candy bars, and always held America in high regard for things like the Marshall Aid plan. He also told me about hiding during bombing raids, but always felt it was a necessary evil, even when a bomb landed in the front of his apartment block. It was never in anger but it was an unspoken understanding that this was a necessary evil to eliminate a greater evil.

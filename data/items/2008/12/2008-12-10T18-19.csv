""I have seen the result of that attitude in new graduate students: It is rare that anyone thinks about the structure of their code or the implications for scaling and maintenance – those are not academic subjects.

If I believed that Flash were superior technology for what we're doing (a complex web app), we'd be using it. For me, the real issue is that Flash doesn't fit the web as well as Ajax. That's a big deal.<p>One hears frequent complaints about how awful it is to have to cobble applications out of HTML/JS/CSS and coax them into running in browsers that were never designed for that. That's true, but it begs a question: why, if it's so awful, do so many people do it? It must have huge value to justify all that effort.<p>There are all kinds of subtle differences between programming for the web and programming for a desktop-like environment embedded in a web browser. I think it's a mistake to assume that the latter would be better if only we could have it.<p>There's another way to look at this. One reason the ""bad"" approach often succeeds while the ""good"" approach fails is that what seems good is based on previous experiences that don't quite fit what's emerging. Meanwhile the ""bad"" approaches seem bad because they're messy and chaotic, yet they contain something important and new that is worth the messiness. This is how I look at Flash.

Why does it come as any surprise that consumers are flocking to the cheaper alternatives? And of course, given that application developers are competing with one another, price is one of the key ways they are going to do that. This is classic supply and demand at work.<p>Maybe this is just because I look at it from the perspective of a web application developer, and think to myself, ""If ONLY there was an easy way to charge people a low price like $0.99 to use my app instead of having to rely on Google Ads for revenue...""<p>All of this said, it does sound like Apple could make some changes to the iTunes app store experience to help application developers better showcase the experience of higher priced apps.<p>Another interesting idea would be for Apple to facilitate a way for application developers to create charges from within the app itself. So maybe you could download the app itself for free, but the app could charge you for premium features, or pennies for certain kinds of usage, etc.",1228933198

I see some QBs who were picked second or third who also did well. (Overall picks aren't really fair, as teams have many reasons for selecting other positions.) And I see a couple black swans, like Romo.<p>That's what you would expect if they were really good at their job. If they were bad at it, you'd expect more first picked QBs sucking, and more people coming out of nowhere.<p>Objectively measuring is impossible. Passer rating is more an indication of the quality of a team's offensive line, receivers, etc. than QB skill.

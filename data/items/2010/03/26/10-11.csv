It's probably a good practice of any thinking person.<p>Routine conditions are a case where self-diagnosing will yield adequate results most of the time. But outside of the most common conditions, a smart but not medically trained person will end up treating symptoms rather than causes. A good example is blood pressure. You can walk into any pharmacy and find out within a minute if you have high blood pressure. For 80% of cases, you could probably just look up the most popular generic medication, start at a low dose and adjust a month at time until your blood pressure is normal. But what about the underlying cause? It could be an endocrine system problem, enlarged heart, arterial narrowing of the blood vessels from the kidneys, or ion channel exchange imbalances, to name a few. It is routine for a general practitioner to check for these and other causes and interpret the results of their tests, but is decidedly not routine for most smart people.",1269600845

1220697,comment,1220298,1220454,0,0,pmjordan,,,"<i>So the distance does matter, it seems. Can anyone figure out under which conditions a pen doesn't fall to a moon?</i><p>When there is a force holding the moon in place that doesn't act on the pen as well, or the pen is really far from the moon.<p>Orbit is a special case, so assume earth, moon and pen start at rest. They will all start accelerating towards their combined centre of mass. The pen essentially doesn't contribute at all to the location of the centre of mass; If moon and earth had quasi-zero radius, the pen would hit the object first on whose side of the centre of mass (CM) it started on. (the objects' acceleration will be such that their individual CMs would hit the CM at exactly the same time, so the objects nearest the CM will accelerate slowest)<p><pre><code>  earth - pen - CM - moon -> pen hits earth first.\n  earth - CM - pen - moon -> pen hits moon first.\n</code></pre>\nEarth is bigger than the moon, which is much bigger than the pen, so this won't quite be true, but the pen will still have to be quite far from the moon to begin with for it to make a difference. (distance pen-moon vs. radius of moon vs. distance moon-earth)<p>The original question is clearly the latter case. In fact the pen and the moon are so close compared to any third objects, and the pen's mass so irrelevant, that you can treat them as being in the moon's frame of reference. So unless there's a force acting on either the moon or the pen which <i>isn't</i> acting on the other (this can never be true for gravity), the pen will always drop to the moon.<p>Because this is true in general, it is also true in orbit.<p>Aside: Note that there cannot be any tides on the moon because the moon itself rotates around its own axis at the same rate as it rotates around earth. Also, the water involved in tides doesn't start floating off - it is still very much attracted to the earth, and the deformation of such a gigantic body of water is extremely slight - metres of deformation of a shell with a radius of ~6300km. You won't notice the pen's reaction to that sort of force.",1269600408

1220690,comment,1220556,1220556,0,0,f3,,,"It is interesting to see South Africa's two biggest rent seeking industries (telecommunications and banking) covered in one post :-)<p>Things are changing, but there are issues that more undersea cables and a tiny opening in the banking system won't be able to fix.<p>You still have to pay Telkom for a voice land-line, and that adds to the cost. It can still take months to get a land-line, and waiting for an ADSL connection is also a problem, so many people don't bother.<p>Telkom remains a de-facto monopoly for fixed lines (Neotel's current offerings still seem to be wireless, and of variable quality), and the South African government needs to be even more aggressive IMO in undoing the disaster of Telkom's mid-90's state-granted monopoly, and it also needs to take a tougher regulatory line with mobile providers. I'll really start celebrating when cheap uncapped wireless/3G becomes available at reasonable rates.<p>PayPal is also a good start, but the terms and conditions are strict. You can't leave the money in your PayPal/FNB account for longer than 30 days, and all transactions need to be reported to the Reserve Bank for exchange-control purposes through the FNB website. There is also a prohibition against ""bulking"", so I guess you may need to report and withdraw money for each transaction individually, meaning higher fees (see above point about rent seeking).<p>On a related note, exhange controls are a relic of the past, and should have gone years ago. Even though for the average person they are moot (the offshore allowances are now quite large) the amount of regulatory pain they put one through is deeply disruptive. I recall an former employer needing excon permission to purchase a developer suite from overseas - not the way to be part of the hi-tech global economy.",1269600084

Theora is from the previous generation of codecs, which means it is both simpler and older, two very good things when it comes to patents.

655921,comment,655186,655186,0,0,baguasquirrel,,,"A little anecdote.  A friend of mine who's working on his Ph.D at CMU sped up his physics group's simulations by an order of magnitude by simply running the same code multiple times on multiple machines.  The problem was that the choice of initial random seeds could nontrivially effect the convergence time.  There are examples of this in generic programming.  Look at quicksort for example.  Picking the right pivot can matter a great deal.",1244876246

655918,comment,655491,655718,0,0,deno,,,"You can! Although there is still 30 seconds run time limit, it's much more better than cron based solutions. For one you can run tasks in parallel. \nYou can also use something like schema-migration example from Google IO presentation. So one task executes and after it's done adds new task to task queue.<p>They also plan MapReduce on top of task queue, that'll be even better suited for your job.",1244875972

That being said, if you really want a code review device, you might want to look at a cheap laptop or tablet, for one basic reason: there's no direct text editing available on the Kindle, and annotations are painful to write because of the keyboard. The DX doesn't even have numbers on the main keymap, so you have to use a symbol shift to type them.",1244875236
655909,comment,655243,655472,0,0,philwelch,,,"""TV and the web don't really compare yet. Not in quality, not in the viewing experience(can't really watching anything with more than 1 person)""<p>Internet vs. cable TV:<p>-Hulu: 480p. Cable TV: Not unless you have digital cable or HD. But that costs money. So does iTunes, but iTunes has HD. If you really want free HD, hit BitTorrent. Tie.<p>-Timing: TV is either live or DVR'd (asynchronous with use of your own equipment). Internet is completely asynchronous, starting a few hours after the TV (BitTorrent) to the next day (legal services).<p>-Viewing experience: TV can only be viewed on a TV receiver. The internet, and downloaded videos, can be viewed on anything from an iPhone to a notebook to a 22 inch TFT right next to the couch in a tiny studio apartment to a 72 inch HDTV. But hooking your MacBook up to a 72 inch HDTV may not be for everyone (though it's only as difficult as knowing how to hook the right cables the right way).",1244875115

655892,comment,655711,655768,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I agree. But what I really wish to see more of is startup ideas/stories/projects that are based on deeper domain knowledge. What I'm interested in is how long standing business practices or social patterns can be disrupted by the right mix of creative business models and solving tough technological or scientific problems.<p>I'd rather hear something about solving waste management in Naples or interesting software ideas for the upcoming smart grid than about accessing some social network on the iPhone. To be honest, I just don't need any technological solution to keep in touch with the few friends I have. And I'm utterly bored by CSS 3-liners and MySQL sharding.<p>In general, I wish there was more cross-pollination between people with technology competence and people with domain knowledge. This may not be the worst time in history to find people with valuable domain knowledge who are looking for new opportunities and would like to join forces with hackers.<p>I realise that this is difficult and it's obviously not HN's fault that it's so rare. Maybe ycombinator could do more to break out of the pure web dev space.",1244873950
655891,comment,655541,655541,0,0,triplefox,,,"I've met and spoken with some of the ""instant successes"" in Flash gaming. DTD, Filler, etc. From the little bit of discussion I had, I got the impression that they didn't really have any profound understanding of how or why the game they made became hugely popular. Mostly, they were benefiting from right-place-right-time effects, from being relative outsiders to gaming, and from having just enough skills to do the job.<p>Basically, trying to crank out games quickly isn't really a recipe for success. It <i>is</i> a good starting place for creative ideas, though. You can start a project with one thing in mind, build it up to a certain stage, leave it a while to think about, and later come back and iterate on the whole concept.<p>But if you are looking for reliable success in games, the time spent is way more important.",1244873940

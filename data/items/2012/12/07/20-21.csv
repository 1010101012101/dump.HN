But one of the things missing from your comment is that <i>good</i> lawyers are protecting their clients from the possibility of things going wrong in the future.<p>Contracts are often unclear and are often broken. Sometimes things just don't work out. Regardless of how, litigation often ensues. That's when the value of a lawyer becomes apparent. It's easy to complain about lawyers during the negotiation - they often needlessly inject themselves into the process - but it would be worth considering that a good lawyer is trying to protect you in case things go wrong.

I just looked up the HTC One V, and what I saw leads me to think I will switch to this.<p>If I may impose and if you or another reader have anything you would care to add, may I pick your brain as to any other observations / trade-offs you made in your decision to go with the HTC and/or to stay with Virgin Mobile?  As opposed to, as a primary example, another pre-paid plan or phone.<p>(If not, hope I haven't annoyed by asking.  Just in case a specific interest / use would inspire further comment.)<p>--<p>I've also considered the T-Mobile based plans, but I'm afraid that coverage on the far city-fringe and beyond might just be too spotty.  Although I'm not sure Virgin would be better -- the last I recall, though, it ran on Sprint, which actually did ok around here, at least for voice.",1354910548

No one clicked on it. We're working on a new simple one with one button and small 20% off coupon at the bottom. Conversions went from 0% to 28%.",1354910462

What kind of ""relevant"" response to ""one guy gave free flu shots"" can be expected?<p>I would say that this is not an especially good post for Hacker News, in that it concerns neither programming nor the business of start-ups. Larry Page works for an interesting company, but this is not news of that company doing something interesting; it's a philanthropy report. Good Hacker News threads provoke discussion; there's not much to discuss w/r/t philanthropy unless you bring up the subjects which are now being criticized as too negative.<p>I <i>would</i> say that, but it's a tradition of Hacker News to be far less focused on its main subjects than it says it is, and posts like this arouse interesting discussion.",1354910451

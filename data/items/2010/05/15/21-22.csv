Nothing in the article suggests that bachelor's degrees will be unimportant in the future, particularly for the best jobs.  The article also points out (correctly) that people without college degrees make less on average, and have less reliable employment.<p>If anything, this is a disturbing piece of evidence that jobs requiring skilled labor are becoming less prevalent.

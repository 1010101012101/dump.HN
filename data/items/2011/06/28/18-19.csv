When I am on facebook I behave like I am in public. I don't hope for the best and write secret stuff anywhere. But with all the google searches I make through a day, I am giving google a lot of very personal information that I would not like anyone to see. I would hate to see something that I was searching for somehow show up in a stream for my friends to see because I accidentally clicked a +1 button or similar.</i><p>I think you hit the nail on the head. I think Google+ looks pretty neat. It's more along the lines of what I am looking for in a social network than Facebook is. But I do not plan to use it for the exact reasons you mentioned.<p>My searches are private. Anything I do on a social network is public. I do not want the two of them mingling. I don't want the possibility of an accident. I don't want a single entity to ""own"" my search and social data.<p>I really wish someone else had created this.",1309287561

They can't just roll out a whole new kind of content discovery feature, where you met strangers and their content. (think about reddit, hn..)(or could they?)

2706704,comment,2705915,2706041,2,0,domador,,,"Robin,<p>Yes, if an attacker obtained the password database, they could use the password hashes to log in with any particular user's account.  They wouldn't need to know that user's plaintext password.<p>Like you, I'd also thought about storing a second-level hash (a hash of the bcrypt hash).  However, I didn't mention it because I don't currently understand the complexity of hash functions well enough.  There are at least two issues that come to mind regarding the complexity of the second-level hash function:<p>1) If we used MD5 or SHA-1, would this cause the same problem Coda Hale warned against?  A bcrypt hash would likely be longer and more complex than a typical user-defined 6 character password.  Could a cracker feasibly produce the MD5 hashes for all the strings as long as a bcrypt hash?  (I don't know how much slower MD5 gets with each additional input character, or how much slower it gets to produce MD5 hashes for all the strings of a given length.)<p>2) If we used bcrypt itself as a 2nd-level hash, wouldn't that cause the same problem I was trying to avoid (running bcrypt at log-in time)?  Maybe this 2nd-level bcrypt hash could be configured to be less computationally expensive that the 1st-level hash (the one used on a user's plaintext password).  Thus it'd be moderately inexpensive to verify a user's password, but more expensive to crack it (since the input string the password cracker is trying to find is a bcrypt hash, not a traditional, weak user-selected password).  Like you said, I need a security expert (or several) to look into this.<p>Thank you for your feedback.",1309286930

It's too long to include here, and it's not yet ready to ""publish"".  You're about two weeks too early.<p>But let me ask you this.  It's easy to cut a square into identical pieces so that all the pieces touch the center point.<p>In slightly more detail, the pieces are disjoint sets such that their union is the whole square.  The pieces are identical except perhaps for details as to the boundaries.  To say that they all ""touch"" the center point means that every non-zero radius disk centered at the center contains some points from each piece.<p>So now, how many ways can this be done?  No, it's not five.  And no, it's not six either.<p>When you start trying to work it out you find that the details matter, and they <i>can't</i> just be covered by a ""childish"" drawing to illustrate.<p>Details matter, and some of them are <i>hard.</i><p>Yes, most math teaching is atrocious.

I once worked on an index_server for Haiku that worked somewhat like Spotlight's daemon. A new and much improved version of index_server is already in the Haiku repos, but it's disabled for now. This will form the basis for moving indexes out of the file system.<p>On losing metadata: every modern filesystem in use supports extended attributes, so this shouldn't be a problem when copying files between BFS and NTFS, EXT4, btrfs, HFS+ or ZFS. The only filesystem that will cause problems is FAT32, which most people still use with USB drives. I don't know how that will be handled in Haiku.",1309286331

If that action resulted in the URL being added to the googlebot's itinerary, even though no publicly visible webpage links to it, the result could be the exposure of information that we don't want.  Or for the blog post example, it could even affect SEO by causing a duplicate content penalty.<p>Of course we can password protect the page, exclude the urls in robots.txt, etc. But there is a labor cost and inconvenience to having to do that, and there is always risk that something would slip through.<p>That said, what I write above is likely pure speculation; I don't know of any evidence that Google is actually doing this, and it seems unlikely to me that they would.",1309286230

Actually I think that many people <i>like</i> the idea of their posts are being read by as many people as possible and not just the ones with similar interests. Although it <i>looks</i> like a big discussion group, the news feed is really a giant personality-defining display for vain people. I saw a programmer friend post annoyance over some Android API today and I suspect that this was more than just a spontaneous exclamation -- he was communicating that he is smart (to non-techies) and that he is ""cutting edge"" (to fellow programmers).<p>Privacy? I have the feeling that most really don't care very much. But ironically, I think the privacy-thing could actually work in facebook's favor. Here is why: I use fb a lot even though I don't like their privacy policies. I trust google more than facebook. Still, it bothers me when it says ""logged in"" in the google bar at the top because google watches my searches. When I am on facebook I behave like I am in public. I don't hope for the best and write secret stuff anywhere. But with all the google searches I make through a day, I am giving google <i>a lot</i> of very personal information that I would not like anyone to see. I would hate to see something that I was searching for somehow show up in a stream for my friends to see because I accidentally clicked a +1 button or similar.<p>Finally, there is the fact that even if I can export my graph from fb to g+, it's worthless until my friends do the same. And I just don't see that happening before they come up with some truly ground breaking feature that will allow me to get laid with any friend I choose by clicking on their picture :-)",1309285941

All I was saying is that we have to either lower our expectations of how good affordable software can be or accept much higher costs for it.<p>Dropbox love to advertise that they are an extremely safe solution to data storage, thus leading people to believe that their data is safe. Unless every line of code in the authentication module is reviewed and checked and tested, that statement cannot be true. So there is a paradox there.<p>I guess I may have positioned Dropbox too extremely, but Dropbox breaking is much worse than say a music application, some game or other non-critical software. And with Dropbox I believe that development should be approached more like NASA would do it than EA would. People can get hurt!<p>""As for Dropbox, when I see programmers jump all over other programmers for making a mistake, even a big mistake (or series of mistakes compounded), I think schadenfreude.

You want a book that gives you the executive summary or a run-down of specific tools for specific situations. The flaw is not in the books or the teaching, it is what you are expecting from mathematicians.<p>Math is, in a very general sense, about understanding and reasoning about highly structured objects. Mathematicians have developed methods and notation to achieve that end, not to make it easily digestible by the uninitiated. Rigor is an important part of this. It is what allows mathematicians to be so sure their work is correct and it is often what makes math seem so arcane. It is not always necessary for teaching, but professional mathematicians are often the teachers and the ideas are intimately tied to their rigorous formulations in their head.<p>For example, continuity is a fairly intuitive concept in calculus, but the rigorous epsilon-delta definition is necessary in proofs. The basic concept, while easy to explain and understand is useless, while the precise formulation, though much more opaque, is ubiquitous in analysis simply because it is an incredible tool... for mathematicians.<p>An engineer likely just needs the machinery built on top of the analysis: the derivative and integral. If that's all you need, then pick a book that is focused on applications and a development of general intuition, not a book designed for mathematicians-in-the-making.",1309284851

The reverse while loop is also slightly faster to execute than the for loop in the compiled CoffeeScript.<p>And I know that forEach loops incur additional overhead so I use them when it's convenient, when the arrays are small. I don't need to compile my Javascript just to keep from accidentally using forEach in situations where native loops would be better. I usually try to think about these things when I code and I enjoy being able to decide when to use a forEach loop, when to use a reverse while or a vanilla for loop etc. Sometimes, it's good to be specific in how you write code.<p>Furthermore, I would write for loops more succinctly than the compiled CoffeeScript in your example. You can use a for loop to declare the ""item"", ""_i"" and ""_len"" variables inside the loop itself without writing them twice. There's no need for the temporary item variable and the for loop is then short enough to be on one line:<p><pre><code>  for (var _i = 0, _len = list.length; _i < _len; _i++) sum += list[_i].amount;\n</code></pre>\nHere, the hand-tuned Javascript is 32% smaller than the compiled CoffeeScript.<p>I don't mind typing a few more characters if it means I can get closer to the code and serve smaller, faster code to users (or servers). If it means just one less deployment step, or one less 3rd party dependency, or one less leaky abstraction, it's worth it. I think this proves true in the cases above, where CoffeeScript certainly makes the compiled code longer, slower than it needs to be.",1309284260

Most modern MMOs use heavy sharding and can really only support a couple hundred players in the same area or shard at the same time.  With Redis, you might be able to handle many thousands of players in the same area without sharding.  You don't need sub-millisecond response time - as long as you can do most operations in a few milliseconds, things will be fine, since most players are on ~100 millisecond WAN connections anyway.<p>You might finally be able to break the model that current large games like WoW use - heavily sharded with all persistent data stored in Oracle.  Redis should allow you to shard less and use SQL less, resulting in a much better experience, especially when parts of the virtual world get crowded.",1309284164

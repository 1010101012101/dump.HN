The browser spends most of its time isolating different domains, but in this instance the feature seems to be explicitly added to allow for some kind of cross domain interaction. In turn however that would seem to bring with it all the security problems of allowing it - phishing sites can frame your web site and then farm all the information out of the global symbols.

I saw a man in a florid manic state dramatically improve in two week&#x27;s time, kind of magical and it left a lasting impression on me.<p>A few years later I happened to be walking in town, and a man stopped me.  &quot;I know you.  You were one of those students there when I was in the hospital.&quot;  Only then did I know who he was.  I asked how he was doing.  He said &quot;I&#x27;m doing quite well.  Lithium saved my life and I&#x27;m still taking it.&quot;<p>Since then I&#x27;ve had the responsibility of treating many people with mood disorders, and I didn&#x27;t forget what I&#x27;d learned.  Anyway, lithium is still a godsend for many people, but of course it really isn&#x27;t a magic bullet, nothing is.<p>Like all medications it can produce bad effects.  I&#x27;ve seen that happen too.

</code></pre>
That is a very good question. My original intend is for developers. Although there are tools like selenium, setting up, writing and running automated tests can still take a lot of time for the developers. Thats why I believe most developers still do some levels of manual testing, either during developing a feature or after, because the cost of automating it is too high (can easily exceed the time to develop the feature being tested). My frontend developer friends find my app useful mainly because it allows them to validate their code, even in the middle of development where the code churn is very high, since creating and running the tests are almost effortless. Plus, I could add the feature to export the tests/scenarios into test code, which would also be a huge time saver for developers, but this could take weeks.<p>But like you said, since developers have other options, I am not sure if the value proposition is high enough to make this into a viable business model. Another possible kind of customers would be those that doesn’t have the technical still, but need to either validate their websites, or provide a way to validate their websites to someone else, like in your example 1 and 2. The problem is, I am not sure where and how to target this niche of market to focus my marketing on, as it seems they could be in many different industries.<p>This is part of the reason I asked the original question, if I focus on developers, is the app good enough for developers to find it useful? or do I need to spend more weeks to add more features? If I focus on nontechnical users, where and how should I target them? If you have any suggestions, I definitely like to hear them.<p>(for your example 3, there are already better tools like import.io, so I don’t think I will repurpose my app toward that usage for now.)<p>Thanks.",1435362340

Lawrence
 the Court acknowledged the interlocking
nature of these constitutional safeguards in the context of 
the legal treatment of gays and lesbians.  See 539 U. S., at 
575. 
Although 
Lawrence
 elaborated its holding under the 
Due Process Clause, it acknow
ledged, and sought to rem- 
edy, the continuing inequality that resulted from laws
making intimacy in the lives of gays and lesbians a crime
against the State.   See 
ibid. 
Lawrence
 therefore drew 
upon principles of liberty and equality to define and pro
-
tect the rights of gays and lesbians, holding the State
“cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by
making their private sexual conduct a crime.” 
Id.
, at 578. 
This dynamic also applies to same-sex marriage.  It is 
now clear that the challenged laws burden the liberty of 
same-sex couples, and it must be further acknowledged
that they abridge central precepts of equality.  Here the 
marriage laws enforced by the respondents are in essence 
unequal: same-sex couples are denied all the benefits
afforded to opposite-sex couples and are barred from exer
-
cising a fundamental right.  Especially against a long
history of disapproval of their relationships, this denial to 
same-sex couples of the right to marry works a grave and
continuing harm.  The imposition of this disability on gays
and lesbians serves to disrespect and subordinate them. 
And the Equal Protection Clause, like the Due Process
Clause, prohibits this unjustified infringement of the
fundamental right to marry.  See, 
e.g., 
Zablocki
, 
supra
, at 
383–388; 
Skinner
, 316 U. S., at 541<p>That last sentence is the key:<p>>And the Equal Protection Clause, like the Due Process
Clause, prohibits this unjustified infringement of the
fundamental right to marry.<p>They are not &quot;magically&quot; combining anything. Disallowing gays to marry is a violation of BOTH the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause.",1435361852

9788344,comment,9787454,9787454,0,0,sudo_free_cake,,,"I think the research is in regarding consciousness, self, free will, and identity being illusions created by the mind, but I doubt heavily the terminology will ever fall out of the vernacular because it&#x27;s integral in our expression and sharing the conscious experience. Even though we know there is no agent in the brain making decisions we won&#x27;t stop saying, what did YOU DECIDE? or I CHOOSE...blah blah blah. Actually breaking down all the processes in the brain and forming a scientific theory of consciousness as a merger of neuroscience and philosophy of mind could take a long time, perhaps not even in our lifetime. There are all sorts of crazy theories out there about self-organizing maps, and critical size structures, but none of it is really falsifiable at this point. Bacteria I feel I can safely say are not conscious, whatever consciousness is, it appears to require a brain(or computer if you will) of certain attributes to posses it. I think that much is clear. If you look at the behavior of lower organisms, bugs, lizards, things with basic brains and nervous systems, all the behavior is reaction, there is no plan. Higher order brains have the ability to formulate some picture of the future, this helps a lot with survival, if you can envision what is about to happen based on past experience instead of preprogrammed reaction, it increases your fitness. Same as identity can tie you to tribal grouping; having identity, sense of self, working as a group, increases fitness. Personally, my theory of consciousness (of which i have no professional training or merit or evidence in any way) is that it is simply another adaptation for survival. And judging by fitness of organisms with consciousness it seems to be hit and miss. In many parts of the brain we can see pre-existing structures giving rise to algorithms of unconscious behavior controlling all manner of bodily functions. It is my view that the phenomenon of consciousness is like a self-rewriting algorithm to improve our behavior for fitness, basically giving us the ability to learn and reflect. Experiments show that even the behavior we perceive as consciously made is actually triggered milliseconds before we become consciously aware of it. This is where the whole consciousness/free will is an illusion idea comes from. However, subjectively, we know something is going on. As soon as you become consciously aware of your actions you can start analyzing, well what was the outcome?, how does this compare to past attempts? I think that when we are thinking, when we are conscious, as consciousness accesses various parts of the brain it does some rewriting, this is basically learning at the lowest level, making adjustments to improve the outcome. Consciousness, whatever it is, is not the dominant player though, just by flooding the brain with various neurotransmitters behavior completely changes. Often we engage in behavior we don&#x27;t even consciously desire, where you are left wondering &quot;why did I just do that?&quot; or planning &quot;I am definitely going to work out today, thats the best decision to stay healthy&quot; but then the time comes and you don&#x27;t. So as an adaptation, in order to store, analyze, and compare memories, review current environment conditions through awareness, and plan for the future you gotta have consciousness, or least, that appears to be the correlation from what we&#x27;ve seen so far.",1435361611

And he&#x27;s right. But this is not news. Presidents have been trying to assign judges that lean their way on issues since... a long-ass time. The judges are human, moral, and they change their minds about how to interpret the law as the mob&#x27;s mood changes.<p>And he&#x27;s right that the majority simply shoving it&#x27;s way down the minority&#x27;s throat is unjust and is going to breed contempt. When the North defeated the South, racial tension didn&#x27;t just disappear overnight. Those in the South kept a grudge and an ignorance that persists to this day.

Never changing, no matter how hard our society demands it, becomes simple fundamentalism, and our country was not founded on fundamentalism. Our country was founded - no matter how trite this sounds - on the idea of liberty over tyranny. We&#x27;re always going to lean more towards liberty than tyranny.<p>We have a pretty good track record so far of not letting the states or federal government erode our liberty just because of the color of our skin, or our gender, or sexual identity, or religion.

His argument doesn&#x27;t read like a states&#x27; right argument at all.<p>His basic point is that, for better or for worse, the definition of marriage has always been a union between a man and a woman, and that the laws were written with this interpretation in mind. (I agree there, as he provides some good primary sources, and Kennedy&#x27;s majority opinion acknowledges this fact as well.) We&#x27;ll call this opposite-sex definition &quot;Marriage&quot; with a capital &quot;M&quot;. Roberts also demonstrates that Marriage is a guaranteed right. (The majority agrees there, too.)<p>In the cases in question, states sought to restrict some people from Marriage, e.g. interracial couples, convicts, etc. These decisions were struck down by the court, because they violated the right to Marriage as it was guaranteed.<p>The gay marriage issue, however, is different. It does not seek to prevent restrictions on Marriage, but to redefine it to include more people (specifically, opposite genders). Roberts argues that creating rights is not the responsibility of the court, but should instead be handled by the legislative branch.<p>The majority argues that, even though past litigation and legislation only protected opposite-sex Marriage with a capital &quot;M&quot;, it is okay to ignore their intentions if they are harmful or misguided. I think the dissenting justices were wary of doing that, because it goes beyond <i>interpreting</i> the law and wades into <i>writing</i> the law.

They also changed from saying that a parent should teach their child about what it means to be male or female into saying that a child can choose his own gender.<p>You fail to make a convincing argument why this is a bad thing and not a good thing. As you&#x27;ve written it, it&#x27;s descriptive and not prescriptive. The way I see it, these are great things. Tell me why they are bad things.<p>> Polygamy/Polyandry: Three consenting adults all love each other and are currently being denied the right to be married. Why should they be deprived of this &quot;basic civil right&quot;<p>You&#x27;re trying to paint this argument as a spectrum, and attempting to make it seem like &quot;gay marriage&quot; is violet and &quot;polygamy&quot; is indigo. Polygamy has material differences from gay marriage between two adults, that the government will likely not budge on: namely, two vs. multiple. I don&#x27;t personally care if twenty people get married to or have sex with one another, and many cultures don&#x27;t care either. Yet again, my opinion is only one in the melting pot. If it&#x27;s legalized, what&#x27;s the harm? You&#x27;ve yet to successfully opine as to what harm will come about if polygamy/polyandry is legalized.<p>> Pedophillia: We are now told that young children have enough understanding and mental faculty to decide that they should be assigned to a different gender and that they should have the ability to control their own sexuality by obtaining birth control with only their individual consent (not their parent&#x27;s).<p>Yet again, you&#x27;re ignoring the point that deciding what one&#x27;s own gender identity is, is completely distinct from <i>being sexually involved with an adult third party. This is a clear line, and is well defined legally.</i> Consent isn&#x27;t the slippery slope that you&#x27;re making it out to be. A child can&#x27;t create legally binding contracts in the eyes of the US government. What obligation (and to whom) is engendered by deciding that one wants to switch genders? The standard describing who a child can have sex with is based on existing statute, that modern/current science has revealed to be a pretty good way to continue doing things. That is, &quot;don&#x27;t let an adult have sex with kids below (age of consent).&quot; The notion of an age of consent is a hot topic for a good reason: age is truly but a number, but science and psychology suggest that very young children shouldn&#x27;t have sex with people over a decade older than them.<p>> Zoophillia: PETA has already shamefully attempted to exploit the pain and persecution of Black Americans (just as the homosexual movement has done) in order to try and say that animal freedom and rights are equivalent to human rights.[1] If animals can feel and think and be happy and give signs of cooperation and acceptance, then who are we to deny their freedom? If an animal wants to marry a human, then how can we deny the two individuals this basic right? [1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PZBV8O5pfI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PZBV8O5pfI</a><p>How has the &quot;homosexual movement&quot; exploited the pain of Black Americans? I wouldn&#x27;t call it exploitation, I&#x27;d call it liberation. Using your logic, we shouldn&#x27;t have freed slaves either, because the &quot;gays&quot; will soon be able to marry, right?<p>PETA making the argument that animals are like slaves is a silly one. People with darker skin tone are still people. Animals are not people. People who like members of the same sex are still people. <i>This is simple logic.</i> Genetic makeup is the criteria here, much like age and number are the significant criteria for your previous two examples.<p>> And feel free to add on any other combination that an individual decides is their civil right. Because as long as it doesn&#x27;t harm anyone else, who are we to stand in the way of love? Right?<p>Your bitterness is absurd. Polygamy/polyandry may or may not harm others. Pedophilia and zoophilia do harm others who don&#x27;t have a voice, hence the clear divide between those two and <i>a type of legal relationship between consenting adults</i>. Have a good day... my patience for ignorance is wearing thin so my input ends here. Thanks for the semi-sincere arguments.",1435360355

This line of thinking is based on deriving ideas and concepts from one another based on first order logic, empirical evidence, and reproducible experiments. This is a great way to build accurate models of the world, and allows us to build cars, satellites, computers, grow food crops efficiently, and a myriad other wonderful things.<p>By contrast, humanities thinking is about accepting that things can be approached and analyzed from multiple angles, using a variety of ideas, frameworks, and concepts that might be at odds with one another but all still give us valuable insights into whatever it is we&#x27;re studying. This is a great way to approach things like art, human emotions, raising children, and a myriad other wonderful things.<p>Each approach has its place, and being able to use either in daily life is probably a good skill to have. If an algorithm is incorrect, you fix it - trying to argue that an incorrect algorithm holds as much value as a correct one probably isn&#x27;t going to get you anywhere. On the other hand, there isn&#x27;t such a thing as a mathematical function to clearly define what love or a beautiful piece of art is - trying to define such a function probably isn&#x27;t going to get you anywhere.<p>To tie it back within the context of the original post: the vast majority of critics loved the new Pixar movie, and it seems to be a wonderful movie in the cultural context of 2015. But humanities thinking tells us that there is value in taking the movie apart and criticizing it in the way that the article&#x27;s author is doing. Not because he&#x27;s reaching an objective, unique, true conclusion - but because there&#x27;s inherent value in that process, and in taking a stance opposed to the mainstream consensus. It might give one new ways to think about analyzing movies, or put words on some slight discomfort one had while watching the movie even if one enjoyed it, or heighten one&#x27;s enjoyment of the movie, or any number of other things.",1435360291

I&#x27;m not sure what kind of insurance coverage is mandatory for drivers, but if there&#x27;s something many drivers routinely avoid (eg: they have collision only, but no liability) there&#x27;s an opportunity to step in and provide <i>something</i> extra. And/or what some auto clubs have: drivers are covered for so many flat tire repairs, jump starts for dead batteries, etc. Leaving the system cuts both drivers and riders off from this coverage.<p>Also, look for ways to partner and offer additional benefits. There&#x27;s probably some underdog gas/petrol chain which would love to be the exclusive provider and could kick back a small percentage of purchases. Ideally it&#x27;s kicked back to your company via a reward card and is part of your payment to drivers. Rate drivers on vehicle cleanliness and reliability and now there&#x27;s an incentive to have a clean, well-maintained vehicle... and you can partner with a chain of mechanics and auto detailers and give your members a 25% discount or whatever you can negotiate.<p>As you&#x27;re dealing with many low income people, not sure what level of tech you&#x27;re facing, but you could also provide mobile app notifications or SMS a few minutes before the driver arrives.<p>Finally, if the local government wants to make ride sharing a priority why not partner with them to subsidize the program on a per-rider basis? This may let you offer a cash incentive to riders for signup and/or get 100% of your fees through this subsidization, allowing you to pass through all of the monthly fees to the driver. With whatever other benefits you offer, there&#x27;s really NO reason for them to leave the program.",1435360193

9788255,comment,9784008,9784423,0,0,archagon,,,"Maybe this is just my lack of experience speaking, but I find debuggers incredibly difficult to use when dealing with interactive software (which is most software I work on). Hitting a breakpoint freezes my interaction unless I configure it to print something, and configuring it to break conditionally requires knowing some obscure incantations that I can never remember off the top of my head (and that in turn require <i>their own</i> debugging). So it boils down to: should I spend 5 minutes figuring out how to set this conditional, print-only breakpoint? Or should I just put in a printf? The solution, at least to me, is obvious.<p>(With that said, when I have a nasty bug that requires squishing around in the guts of my program, breakpoints are invaluable. But it&#x27;s a pretty huge hammer that only comes out on occasion.)<p>EDIT: I wonder how useful an editor that allows inline debugging code would be? Instead of setting breakpoints in your IDE and then configuring them in an individual window, you&#x27;d enter a &quot;debugging editor&quot; mode that would allow you to add debugger-only code for things like conditional breakpoints and printf statements right alongside your normal code. The original source files would not be edited, but while in this mode, it would appear as if they were. (Maybe the debugging code would show up in red.) That way, you could easily access all your local state and implement complicated queries without ever leaving the context of your code. In other words, it would be just like printf debugging, but once you no longer need to debug you&#x27;d just collapse those statements out by leaving the debugging editor mode and your original code would be unchanged. Perhaps this debugging code would not compile along with the rest of the code but would instead use the debugging hooks that normal breakpoints use, unless the conditions are particularly complex or something. Just a thought.",1435359965

I&#x27;m not saying all judges must be atheists but are people ok with a fundamentalists types from any religion in the supreme court panels?<p><i>Scalia is a devout traditionalist Catholic, and his son, Paul, is a Catholic priest.[109] Uncomfortable with the changes brought about following Vatican II, Scalia regularly attends the Tridentine Latin Mass in both Chicago and Washington, and has driven long distances to parishes that he felt were more in accord with his beliefs.[110] In a 2013 interview with Jennifer Senior for New York magazine, Scalia was asked if his beliefs extended to the Devil, Scalia stated, &quot;Of course! Yeah, he&#x27;s a real person. Hey, c&#x27;mon, that&#x27;s standard Catholic doctrine! Every Catholic believes that&quot;. When asked if he had seen recent evidence of the Devil, Scalia replied, &quot;You know, it is curious. In the Gospels, the Devil is doing all sorts of things. He&#x27;s making pigs run off cliffs, he&#x27;s possessing people and whatnot … What he’s doing now is getting people not to believe in him or in God. He’s much more successful that way&quot;.[111] In another 2013 interview, Scalia stated that &quot;In order for capitalism to work, in order for it to produce a good and stable society, traditional Christian virtues are essential&quot;.[112]<p>In 2006, Scalia, approached by a reporter upon leaving church, was asked if being a traditionalist Catholic had caused problems for him. He responded by asking, &quot;You know what I say to those people?&quot;, and with a gesture, cupping his hand under his chin and flicking his fingers out. The gesture, which was captured by a photographer, was initially reported by the Boston Herald as obscene.</i>",1435359866

The *nix utility &quot;tree&quot; and the source code line counter &quot;cloc&quot; are usually the first 2 things I run on a codebase. This tells me what languages the applications uses, how much of each, how well commented it is and where those files are.<p>The next thing I usually do is find the entry point of the program. In my case this is usually an executable that calls into the core of the library and sets up the initial application state and starts the core loop and routine that does the guts of the work.<p>Once I have found said core routine I try to get a grasp for how the state machine of the program looks like. If it&#x27;s a complicated program this step takes quite a while but is very important for gaining an intuitive understanding of how to either add new features or fix bugs. I like to use my pen and paper to help me explore this part as I often have to back track over source files and re-evaluate what portions mean.<p>Once I have what I think is the state machine worked out I like to understand how the program takes input or is configured. In the case of a daemon that often means understanding how configuration files are loaded and how the configuration is represented in memory. Important to cover here is how default values are handled etc. I actually prioritise this over exploring the core loops ancillary functions (the bits that do the &quot;real&quot; work) as I find it hard to progress to that stage without understanding how the initial state is setup.<p>Which brings us to said &quot;real&quot; work. Hanging off of the core loop will be all the functions/modules are called to do the various parts of the programs function. By this time you should already know what these do even if you don&#x27;t know how they work. Because you already have a good high level understanding at this point you can pick and choose which modules you need to cover and when to cover them.",1435359701

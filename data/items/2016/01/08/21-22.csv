Hint: it ain&#x27;t necessarily the tech. Personal example: AAPL. I make most of my money these days working on Apple tech. The fact that I&#x27;ve made possibly a majority of my retirement money off AAPL has nothing to do with my knowledge of their tech. It has more to do with watching what makes it go up, what makes it go down, and a raft of other factors that have little to do with the technology.<p>Let&#x27;s take a look at some of their tech that drove the price up. iPod: no wireless, less space than a Nomad, lame. Oh, we laugh now, but Cmdr Taco had a solid point. iPad: just a big iPod touch. I said the same thing until FedEx dropped it off. New iPhone comes out, people stand in line for hours or days, Apple can&#x27;t keep up with demand. Stock price goes down. Less on the technical side, Apple crushes earnings; stock goes down (whisper numbers and all that).<p>A sibling comment said 99% of people shouldn&#x27;t own individual stocks, a sentiment I agree with despite holding a majority of our money in individual stocks. Sometimes folks are too smart for their own good, and they even if they work at the company they ignore what really drives the price because of an intimate knowledge of irrelevant pieces, thinking knowledge of those irrelevant pieces gives them a leg up (&quot;<I> know more than the average Wall Street trader.&quot; Not about trading stocks, you don&#x27;t.)<p>(So why do I own so many individual stocks? Because I&#x27;m a special snowflake? No, because I&#x27;m an idiot who thinks previous success means I know what I&#x27;m doing. I really should start diverting to index funds.)",1452289787

The day you stop reinventing yourself and exploring possibilities, allow yourself to live in a rut, spend more time in front of a TV than out exploring the constantly changing world, and have nothing to show for the past year&#x27;s effort but a beer belly, is the day you die.

Founders have substantial equity in their startups.<p>3. Therefore founders get really rich when their startup succeeds.<p>4. More successful startups means more really rich people.<p>5. More really rich people means more inequality.<p>6. Therefore more startups means more inequality.<p>PG defines startups as companies that become large and make their founders rich. So yes, you then trivially get &quot;more startups == more inequality&quot;. However, this loses sight of the fact that when the goal is to create a billion dollar company in a few years there is a huge incentive to game the system, and to produce all sorts of externalities.<p>Take AirBnB. They are effectively an unregulated hotel business. How can a bed and breakfast compete with an airbnb, when they have to face regulations and taxes? How do the neighbors like it when new people move in every couple of days and party all night long? Sacrifices have to made in the name of growth.<p>Another example is Uber or other sharing economy startups. Employees become independent contractors, who are always on the edge of being fired. Who have to pay for their own uniforms, cars and other equipment in order to do their jobs. It&#x27;s pretty ruthless exploitation, but Uber is valued at $70 billion and it&#x27;s super convenient for the customer, so we look the other way.<p>When it comes to software if you want to serve the most people you work with open protocols, you open source your software (so it can be inspected for quality and security), you make importing and exporting to competing products easy and fast and so on. If you want to make a billion dollar business you keep everything proprietary and you create a walled garden with tremendous lock in.<p>Just look at all the open source products that our startups are built on top of. Billions of dollars worth of free software. What do the contributors get? Nothing. (Not strictly true; they get angry bug reports, but you get my point). This is not the natural order of things, so we should question whether this is just.<p>There&#x27;s a big difference between companies that provide a huge amount of value, and companies that can CAPTURE a huge amount of value. Startups have to be in the second category, and that has huge social implications worth thinking about. The founders necessarily play only a small role in the success of their business -- we all stand on the shoulders of giants after all -- so why should the founders be the ones who capture all the rewards?",1452288684

I&#x27;ll note that the listing was last updated in 2007, so his name&#x27;s been on the contact info for 8+ years - probably at that time they renewed for as long as the system would allow.<p>There are provisions in place for replacing contacts on registered domains when the contact is someone no longer with an organization, and I&#x27;m pretty sure those aren&#x27;t generally all that onerous (since incorrect changes can be reverted) - generally something on organization letterhead, probably a drivers&#x27; license photo, that kind of thing. In this case because the originally registering organization no longer exists they basically need proof that either the current foundation is legally the successor entity or they need proof that the domain name was part of the &quot;assets&quot; transferred to the new 501(c)3. They could probably have just sent in a change request on the current letterhead, but I suspect that A) they&#x27;re no longer at that address either, B) Someone at Verisign said &quot;Hey.... If we force an expiration we can auction this sucker for $$$$$$&quot;, or C) Leon Shiman could be expected to object to a change.<p>Another problem is the question of whether there&#x27;s a registered trademark for X.Org - if they had that, even if someone else snagged the domain I suspect they&#x27;d be able to get it back via UDRP.

For one thing there is no public conversation about income inequality.  The press is owned by corporations, whose majority ownership is billionaires.  Even this forum is owned by Y Combinator, a corporation which owns shares of companies who have collectively raised billions of dollars.<p>I mean, elected political parties like Hezbollah in Lebanon have television channels like Al-Manar.  When someone like Javed Iqbal in the US sets up receiver satellite cards so Americans can watch this channel - he was sent to prison for over six years.  That&#x27;s the &quot;public conversation&quot; in the USA.<p>There have been somewhat open channels of public discussion on the Internet like Usenet.  Which is why the US government and last-mile monopolies got together to work to crush Usenet a few years ago, which for the most part worked in severely harming it.<p>Then it&#x27;s also in the interest of the idle class heirs who expropriate surplus labor time from those of us who work to try to muddle the conversation.  The idle class is who has been working to take the &quot;focus&quot; <i>off</i> &quot;specific underlying components&quot;.  It&#x27;s farcical that the people working to confuse the issue then go on to complain how it seems so unfocused.<p>It&#x27;s pretty simple - any created wealth is created through work.  Heirs who do not work can then only live by expropriating surplus labor time from those of us who do work.  It&#x27;s as simple as that.  It&#x27;s been happening for 10,000 years, whether it&#x27;s called slavery, or serfdom, or modern wage slavery.  It&#x27;s all the same thing.  Among we who do all the work and create all the wealth has been awareness of the 1% parasites who feed off of our labor.<p>If the focus of the issue is confused, it&#x27;s because the offending group wants it to be confused - the people who own the press, who jail the Javed Iqbal&#x27;s who allow different views from elected parliamentary parties, who crush public forums like Usenet etc.",1452288584

When we consider rent extraction by wealthy individuals or disparate allocation of resources by the government we&#x27;re observing mechanisms that decrease the resources available to lower income individuals, thus inhibiting them from increasing their economic status.<p>No one would care about economic inequality in an economy with sufficient economic mobility to reach the upper echelons with plausible (though significant) effort - in fact, economic inequality of the degree that we observe would likely not be possible in such a society.

When you flip on a light switch the power to light up your room is being generated <i>instantly</i>. That&#x27;s the problem. Utilities do not have large batteries. Electricity is generated on demand and the utilities have to estimate exactly how much power they need to generate <i></i>ALL THE TIME<i></i>.<p>When a utility adds wind and solar to their portfolio they also have to hire experts to analyze the weather. These experts need to estimate how much power the wind and solar are going to provide <i>every day</i>. There are times when entire wind farms are shut off because they will be generating too much power! There are other times when they are shut off because of concern that the weather could damage them. This is not easy.<p>Imagine adding tens of thousands of tiny solar arrays to your grid and then having no knowledge of how well they are going to operate. You can&#x27;t possibly begin to estimate what the cloud cover is going to be like for all of these installations over your territory. You don&#x27;t know how well they are maintained. You don&#x27;t have any clue if they&#x27;re kept clean. You might not have the infrastructure to accept electricity back into the grid (substation upgrades are not cheap).<p>The grid would gladly accept your power if they knew it was safe to do so. The fact is that it isn&#x27;t. If too little power is generated, brownouts or blackouts occur. If too much is generated equipment is damaged and shit starts on fire.<p>What we need is a <i>SMART</i> grid. It does not exist yet. It will take many years. Large battery installations may be a good stop-gap. But to vilify the utilities is ignorance when you don&#x27;t really understand how the grid works.<p>edit: I actually know of a giant private wind farm that was built on the idea that they could sell access to it back to a utility. Unfortunately it has been sitting dormant for a couple years because the cost to get the backhaul to the windfarm was too much, and the private investor had no idea the windfarm couldn&#x27;t just be hooked up.",1452287869

For another example, there is... well was... a small greek chicken joint that operated for 15 years nearby. The owner was 1st generation american, and all he wanted to do was cook his family recipes and share them with the community. Problem is the community changed in the past decade, going from being mostly European-heritage to N. African nationals. His customer base dwindled, and he never changed his stance of doing what he loved.<p>A month after his restaurant closed, it was replaced with one which served all halal chicken and is now jam packed with more customers than any other business sees. It&#x27;s success has convinced the owner to expand leftwards into another collapsing business.<p>Point is... the path to profitability is finding a customer base willing to pay you.

This is a bogus complaint about proof of correctness.<p>The way you prove halting is to find some integer measure for each loop (like &quot;iterations remaining&quot; or &quot;error being reduced&quot;) which decreases on each iteration but does not go negative.  If you can&#x27;t find such a measure, your program is probably broken. (See page 12 of [1], the MEASURE statement, for a system I built 30 years ago which did this.)<p>The measure has to be an integer, not a real number, to avoid Zeno&#x27;s paradox type problems. (1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 ...)<p>On some floating point problems, with algorithms that are supposed to converge, proving termination can be tough.  You can always add an iteration counter and limit the number of iterations.  Now you can show termination.<p>Microsoft&#x27;s Static Driver Verifier is able to prove correctness, in the sense of &quot;not doing anything that will crash the kernel&quot;, about 96% of the time.  About 4% of the time, it gives up after running for a while.

In such species, the colony acts like an organism despite each animal’s physical individuality. This paper frames human sociality through the superorganisms metaphor by systematically reviewing the superorganismic features of human psychology. These features include: (1) mechanisms to integrate individual units, (2) mechanisms to achieve unity of action, (3) low levels of heritable within-group variation, (4) a common fate, and (5) mechanisms to resolve conflicts of interest in the collective’s favor. It is concluded that human beings have a capacity to partly and flexibly display each of these superorganismic properties. Group identification is a key mechanism that activates human superorganismic properties, and threats to the group a key activating condition. This metaphor organizes diverse aspects of human psychology (e.g., normative conformity, social identity processes, religion, and the “rally-around-the-flag” reflex) into a coherent framework.",1452287066

Somewhere along the last year, it was determined that the spinoff might incur a huge tax bill, costing shareholders a few billion dollars. Last month, they decided to do a reverse spin-off. Instead of spinning off Alibaba, spin off everything else (which is only worth a few billion). The tax bill on 4B is much less than the tax bill on 30B.<p>In other words, all that would be left after the spinoff is an Alibaba holding company.",1452286996

Further, wouldn&#x27;t that pressure be somewhat proportional to the upward pressure he created with the buy activity, given that he was trying to make those fractions whole again?<p>Edit: It just seems that there had to be some outside demand that subsequently dried up. Otherwise, we would expect to see at least a gradual, steady decline in price as he created more and more artificial supply. I suppose that could have then been folllwed by the dramatic rise if he was in too big a hurry in his recovery buying, but again, there seems to be some actual demand that went missing at some point.",1397181430

Traditional sales channel for enterprise is top down where you go after execs, senior management, etc. and work your way down.  IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, etc. can afford the top down approach.

When it seems the music is about to stop in the musical chairs of the world economy, people pay a premium for precious metals because they feel safe in that they have value.  Bubbles tend to happen in a go-go economy, precious metals become temporarily overpriced when people are worried about the world economy.

And the photon, by virtue of having both changed and not changed, carries that superposition information and can bring it to a different atom-based qubit.<p>I know almost nothing about Quantum Mechanics, but this sounds amazingly ingenious.<p>So what did they do, some sort of <i>parallel universe transistor</i> where the rubidium atom acts as the gate?

Not that it will materially affect them.  The Cassandras who have been warning about Bitcoin will continue to be ignored, the press will still beat a door to put a microphone in front of these snake oil peddlers.

It is complete nonsense.  Moreover it is not falsifiable.  It is basically &quot;they are worth something because people think they are worth something&quot;.  So even if Bitcoin crashes, that theory can still stand, since it can not be falsified.  That stripe of value theorist can just say people stopped thinking Bitcoins were valuable, so their price fell.<p>Wise people can take the rise and fall of Bitcoin and ask real questions about where the value of commodities come from.  The answer of the Bitcoin theorists, which is not that far off from mainstream economists, is a far cry from what economists like Benjamin Franklin, David Ricardo, Adam Smith thought the value of commodities came from.<p>I already mentioned how precious metals have retained value over millenia.  Some Bitcoin advocates point to the dollar and say if the dollar retains value, why can&#x27;t Bitcoin?  This is a complex issue which would take too long to go into here.  For one thing, the dollar does not retain its value - a dollar from today is worth much less than a dollar in 1978.  Also, the conspiratorial gold bugs who say the dollar is about to collapse are probably overstating the immediacy of the problem - but that does not mean there is not a kernel of truth to their worries about paper currency.

Common strategies implemented by program trading involve an attempt to engage in arbitrage and portfolio insurance strategies. As computer technology became more available, the use of program trading grew dramatically within Wall Street firms. After the crash, many blamed program trading strategies for blindly selling stocks as markets fell, exacerbating the decline. Some economists theorized the speculative boom leading up to October was caused by program trading, and that the crash was merely a return to normalcy. Either way, program trading ended up taking the majority of the blame in the public eye for the 1987 stock market crash. U.S. Congressman Edward J. Markey, who had been warning about the possibility of a crash, stated that &quot;Program trading was the principal cause.&quot;[12]&quot;",1397178698

If this were a real application it could probably make sense to define the query interval on the specific type, but lets just say, for the sake of illustrating the idea, that the desired interval for a specific provider could depend not only on the type but also the total number of providers already allocated for a given type.<p>For example, perhaps the ProviderFactory might calculate the total number of WeatherProviders already defined, and reset the query_interval for all WeatherProviders to be (some_weather_provider_specific_constant * total_number_of_allocated_weather_providers). Whenever a new WeatherProvider is requested from the factory, the factory increases the query_interval for all WeatherProviders. In this way, the ProviderFactory acts as an automatic rate limiter for each provider by keeping track of each instance.<p><i>With the data structure you have, any time you add a new provider, you&#x27;d need to add a new case to that switch statement.</i><p>Well yeah, that&#x27;s pretty critical to the &quot;factory&quot; role of the ProviderFactory, how else could the factory return a variety of types if it didn&#x27;t have a case/branch for each signal that represents each type? Additionally, if individual logic is required for preparing a certain type of provider, the switch statement is there to accommodate the needs of the specific type before returning it.<p><i>That&#x27;s like the polar opposite of separation of concerns.</i><p>How do you figure? In this example, the factory is concerned with all logic related to instantiating and appropriately configuring each instance depending on the type of instance, the state of the app or the state of other instances. I&#x27;m not sure what concerns are mixed here. Alternatively, I <i>could</i> export all that logic into a NewFooProvider function for each of the various FooProviders, but the idea is to encapsulate all that custodial work within the factory so that a Provider user only has to request their specific provider and <i>that&#x27;s it</i>.<p><i>What do the types even do in your example?</i><p>Nothing. It&#x27;s just an example.<p><i>The same for the host they connect to. Shouldn&#x27;t that be defined in the type? Like make WeatherProvider.Connect() call ProviderFactory.WeatherHost() to get the host to connect to.</i><p>I think you&#x27;re missing the point. Yes, yes, that design would work fine, but all you&#x27;re really telling me here is &quot;you don&#x27;t need to use a factory in this example&quot;. What I&#x27;m saying is, <i>when</i> I want to use a factory (lets just assume that it makes sense in the design of my app, unless your argument is that a factory is never useful), I have to indicate <i>which type</i> of instance I want the factory to produce by using a zeroed struct or an arbitrary data type, what&#x27;s going on within my factory is actually irreverent; any example factory snippet could be refactored into something less complex when your only context is 100 lines in a scratch pad.<p><i>You&#x27;re doing everything inside out.</i><p>I&#x27;ll seriously take that opinion into consideration.",1397178671

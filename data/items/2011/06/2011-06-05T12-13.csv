They are more into management (yes, this is an euphemism). If you look at their core products, they are almost all essentially acquired or ""copied"". (DOS-, NT-VMS, IE-Spyglass, DirectX was essentially NV1 etc.) They are successful at ""selling"" and doing DM with influential people.<p>Very few people actually go out and buy their products, which would be true sign of best fulfilling a need in the demand-offer market sense. But most of their cash cows are shipped OEM or are centrally purchased and shoved down the corporate/gvt-al echelons.

Once there are k elements in the heap, we know that whenever we remove an element from the heap, we will immediately be adding a new one.<p>In a traditional heap implementation, popping is performed by replacing the root with the bottom-right-most element and heapifying down.  This is potentially 2 * log(k) comparisons.  Pushing is performed by adding the new element to the bottom-right and heapifying up, which is up to log(k) comparisons.  We can combine the pop and push into a single operation and reduce the 3 * log(k) comparisons to just the 2 * log(k) comparisons.  Instead of replacing the root with the bottom-right-most element, just replace it with the new element and heapify down.  This not only reduces the worst-case number of comparison; it improves the expected number of comparisons since the bottom-right element is likely to still belong at the bottom and will be pushed down the entire tree, while the new element is more likely to belong somewhere shallower.",1307278007

I'm just betting that the investors, who <i>are</i> pretty savvy, <i>do</i> know whether their financials are good. Of course, you're suggesting that the investors are in this because they believe future investors will pay them back, and so on, but I think the people investing in Groupon are doing so for solid reasons.<p>'Even if you tell the public, ""Full disclosure: I'm running a ponzi scheme, you want in?"" it's still illegal.'<p>Someone mentioned in another comment that a Ponzi scheme, by definition, means that people don't know it's a ponzi scheme. The commenter contrasted this to a pyramid scheme, where everyone can know. Is that true?<p>In any case, I thought it worthwhile to copy this form Wikipedia:<p>""A bubble: A bubble is similar to a Ponzi scheme in that one participant gets paid by contributions from a subsequent participant (until inevitable collapse), but it is not the same as a Ponzi scheme. A bubble involves ever-rising prices in an open market (for example stock, housing, or tulip bulbs) where prices rise because buyers bid more because prices are rising. Bubbles are often said to be based on the ""greater fool"" theory. As with the Ponzi scheme, the price exceeds the intrinsic value of the item, but unlike the Ponzi scheme, there is no person misrepresenting the intrinsic value. With the greater fool theory in mind, some may invest even though they believe the securities are overpriced due to a bubble.""<p>In other words, the only thing that really changes between a Ponzi/Pyramid scheme and a bubble, is that investors think there is actually something of value underlying the investments. Obviously, many people disagree, but I'm not sure that we shouldn't give savvy investors the benefit of the doubt. Especially investors who have a lot more access to proprietary information, and who have had a lot more time to look over Groupon's terms.<p>* Note: I wrote a lot of things about the definition of a Ponzi scheme which are probably obvious to you.

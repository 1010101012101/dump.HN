Moore's law would still be there, but it might just be a means for increasing profit margin or enabling ever-more-bloated systems, under strict control by manufacturers.<p>The web might exist but as a phenomenon among people who buy weird computers like NeXTs.",1228125580

Now that only relates to the market and stocks specifically, but apply that to your idea - startup costs specifically, mustn't they be low too? Supplies, equipment, all marked and coming down due to businesses going belly-up. You fancy open source, so that's a cost saver too... heck, you've got an MBA and you're asking us about plunging, mortgages and finances?<p>I say keep at your goal in the moonlight, pay off deficits as much as possible, that way you'll have less to worry about when you do take the plunge. I'm not really impressed with the numbers showing page views - your company could go bankrupt for some illegal exposure that you didn't foresee occurring. What I am concerned about is how much can you afford, and/or how much can you risk? If you don't have a backup plan, I say you have no plan - hence the cushion that the 35% would provide.<p>Best of luck.",1228124558

There is no reason this should be a web application - in a perfect world, I want something like this directly integrated into my database tool, and not have me open my browser and all that.<p>At the same time, considering that the data work may be large, having this on a server is not too bad of an idea.<p>What I suggest to you is this - spend a day to make a version of this wrapped in a web browser in a .exe file.

Of course, O'Reilly will do their own marketing, but I feel like I ought to be doing my own guerrilla marketing since I'm a geek.<p>I would love to hear the thoughts of HN people on good ways to build a buzz.<p>PS I probably should have said a bit more about the book: it's 128 places around the world with significant scientific, mathematical or technological significance without being a list of the the usual science museums (although there are a few good ones in the book).  The book has information about the place, and an explanation of the science behind it.<p>An example place is The Horn Antenna (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_Antenna) in New Jersey where the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation was verified (by accident).<p>To be notified about the book you can put your email address on my little mailing list: http://www.jgc.org/blog/2008/12/geek-atlas-mailing-list.html",1228123953

I'm using Clojure a lot and really like it.<p>But Lisp has been around for 50 years and never hit the mainstream so it seems there perhaps is something about it that doesn't fit with most programmers?<p>Also it only offers one form of concurrnecy and while I like it there is still much speculation and research in the area.
Scala for example kind of builds on the whole Java-language and offers a more recognizable language for Java-developers and more opportunities to roll your own concurrency-mechanisms, or at least that's the impression I've gotten.<p>And then we have Haskell and Erlang.",1228123073

It was on green construction paper and written with a red marker.<p>My initial thought was 'maybe she'll be cheap' and then 'do I want someone in my house that thinks magic marker is the proper way to make a sign for their business?'<p>Another example:  I buy a LOT of things online.  But I only buy from sites that I feel I can trust.  That means they don't -look- like a scam, and they look like they know what they're doing.  When I go to a site that looks like it came from 1990, I might check prices, but I -never- buy.  Instead, I go back to somewhere 'safe' like Amazon and pay a little more.<p>Most of the examples (shoes, chairs, tables) were designed to prevent or force certain behaviors.

Resetting an iPod requires an extremely unintuitive key sequence [0]. Apple doesn't want the user to know an iPod can be reset - resetting is something your PC does when it doesn't work anymore.

1767590,comment,1767309,1767309,0,0,sekizaru,,,"Wow! Nice work. I had the exact same idea awhile back and even started on a prototype version of it. Really happy (and a bit jealous) to see it done so well.<p>Some of the things that I thought would be good:
<i>Auto-complete (with a drop-down box) for the search box is a really nice way to search a restricted domain like movie names. This reference was useful for me: <a href=""http://www.webreference.com/programming/javascript/ncz/column2/4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webreference.com/programming/javascript/ncz/colum...</a>
Although the search result page is good so need to find a balance between directing to the actual movie page and the search page.<p></i>Combined lists with other users was the main focus I had when I was playing with this. Good to make it more obvious that inviting your friends allows you to do this. The example in your blog explains this well.<p><i>More lists of movies in the Discover Movies page. The people/genre lists are great but there are a lot more possibilities. Examples: All Academy award winners (by category), Box Office Top 10, Top Grossing Movies of all time, Top movies from other Ratings sites. I think people like to be able to tick off a complete list of something.<p></i>Adding to the list idea, have custom lists created by users. This would be a good viral idea for sharing via Facebook ex. Joe's Top 10 Worst Movies of All Time! How many have you seen?<p><i>Make these list pages as linkable as possible (not just on Facebook) as it will help with ranking on the search engines.<p></i>The viral strategy is a very good approach, but good to have multiple approaches. More link-worthy pages = more links = better search engine rankings.
One more example, make it very, very easy for people to add a link to their profile on their blogs etc. There was also a post here just the other day about startup sites to submit to. Try that as well.<p><i>Some options for sorting or re-arranging the movies would be nice.<p></i>bl4k mentioned affiliate links as a good revenue source. One other possibility would be to pay for privacy so that you can keep your profile private.<p><i>I found that there are lots of movies that I have seen that I want to see again. I know that adding this concept complicates the UI but if you find a nice way to do it it would be useful.<p></i>Include the year after the movie title on the hover overlay.<p><i>I was reluctant to log in using Facebook because I didn't want to post all the movies to my profile. Might be good to include some more clarification about what you do with a users profile (and the email address you need to provide). I'm sure this would increase the sign up rate.<p></i>Are there any issues with using TMDB for some of the data? It might not be an issue now but could become an issue if you get more popular.<p><i>Not sure if some of the pages already include this but a recommended list based on selecting popular movies from other users who have seen similar movies to you.<p></i>Add a link to a movie trailer site<p><i>I really like the implementation of ""I dont want to see this movie"". Good how you just add it on the Discover page and not the individual movie page.<p></i>Add affiliate links to Netflix sooner rather than later. It's useful for users and gives you a good idea how much revenue you can earn with little effort.<p>Keep up the great work! Would be great to see a first x months stats post on Hacker News sometime soon.",1286454681

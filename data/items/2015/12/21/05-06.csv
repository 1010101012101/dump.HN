10769797,comment,10769214,10769731,0,0,bronz,,,"This rumor broke a while ago so I don&#x27;t remember the exact details. But essentially what I found when the rumor did break was that Apple had hired lots of engineers who specialized in the automotive industry. I looked at some of the LinkedIn pages and these engineers specialized in things that had basically nothing to do with Carplay. It was claimed that Apple hired tons of these engineers, too many for Carplay to justify,  but I never looked at every single LinkedIn page to confirm. Also, most famously, several vehicles were spotted around the bay area that had license plates connected to Apple. These vehicles were outfitted with arrays of cameras an possibly LIDAR. I assumed that there was no LIDAR to be safe. In my judgement the quantity and positioning of the cameras indicated very strongly that they were a part of an autonomous vehicle system, not a street view program or anything else I could think of at the time. Then there were the anonymous sources. They claimed that Apple was working on an EV and that its development was referred to as Project Titan internally. I guess that should be taken with a grain of salt. The most convincing thing for me is the broader picture. Apple has a lot of experience and expertise in power electronics. It has manufacturing prowess even if it is through 3rd parties. And it has a huge amount of cash that is sitting around waiting to be spent on creating the next big thing. And most importantly Apple recognizes the fact that there is an EV revolution approaching. The motive, means and opportunity all line up for the Apple EV. All of this makes me give some weight to the rumors but no, nothing has really been proven with hard evidence yet.",1450677216

Theranos was honest and transparent with Mr. Parloff, and the headline to Mr. Parloff’s story is not supported by the facts or the story itself. Let’s take a look.<p>After two months of reviewing his notes, there is no statement by Theranos cited in this article that is in any way inaccurate or misleading to support his headline or the statement in his article that he was misled.<p>Rather, Mr. Parloff states in this story that he made an error: “I then started looking back at my research for the original story—which had been conducted, by then, 17-19 months earlier—to try to reconstruct how I made the error (italics added).” He concludes, “I regret the error.”<p>Mr. Parloff’s basis for saying he was misled appears to rest on the last part of the following statement in his lengthy original article: “I wrote that the company currently offers 200 – and is ramping up to offer more than 1000 – of the most commonly ordered blood diagnostic tests, all without the need of a syringe.”<p>The fact is that Theranos was, indeed, offering 200 diagnostic tests at that time, and was ramping up to offer more than 1000 – all via finger-stick. That is true.<p>Theranos had also developed over 200 assays to run with small volumes from finger-sticks, urine, and other sample types at that time, as we explained to him then. That capability remains today.<p>Theranos did in fact run certain tests collected through venipuncture on its proprietary technologies at the time of this article.<p>Theranos never told Mr. Parloff it was running all of its tests without a syringe – neither did he ask and neither was this a secret. Our website has always made clear that was not the case (e.g. “Instead of a huge needle, we can use a tiny finger stick or collect a micro-sample from a venous draw. Theranos website, 2014). Indeed, Theranos has always been clear – in statements on the website dating back to when it announced its retail lab services in 2013, in statements it made to those who asked, and elsewhere – that it has always performed some tests via venipuncture. As acknowledged in Mr. Parloff’s story, Theranos explicitly discussed its use of venipuncture with him.<p>To be clear, this topic was also not fact checked with Theranos prior to his article. Rather, as he readily states, this sentence was based on assumptions that led to a statement in his article which he is now reading through the lens of other’s faulty reporting – reporting based largely on anonymous and uninformed or misinformed sources with respect to our proprietary technologies and their capabilities.<p>In his article, Mr. Parloff now says that he feels he simply “assumed” that Theranos had brought up over 200 tests to run in its clinical lab only on finger-sticks. Again, Mr. Parloff never asked anyone at Theranos whether that assumption was correct. Had he done so, we would have corrected that ambiguity. And if the sentence had jumped out at the time as containing an erroneous assumption, Theranos would have corrected it.<p>Finally, it is important to point out that when Mr. Parloff first met with Theranos about writing the article, in the spring of 2014, it was originally in connection with a patent troll litigation that Theranos had undertaken. It was in that context — of demonstrating Theranos’ technological capabilities and other intellectual property — that Theranos shared data from the development of over 200 proprietary assays on finger-stick/small volumes of samples.<p>If Mr. Parloff now feels that because of recent reporting he got one sentence in his story from mid-2014 about Theranos wrong, it was not because he was misled, but rather because — as he states — he now feels he made faulty assumptions that he now thinks he should have further clarified. The company has grown and evolved and made many business and regulatory decisions about its operations along the way. At no point did the company mislead him.",1450675901

Talking about all those externalities only serves to create noise rather than support any arguments against the ad model. You can just as easily argue that images and CSS should be removed to save even more bandwidth and processing power. Why even go online at all actually when you can get a newspaper for a few cents?<p>Here&#x27;s the reality - We only have 2 options to enable the value exchange of content: direct (via you moving funds to the publisher) or in-direct (monetizing through ads). It&#x27;s a binary choice. It&#x27;s one or the other, that&#x27;s it. There&#x27;s no magic 3rd option that&#x27;s available (today).<p>Here are a few reasons why advertising is still a better model:<p>- It&#x27;s fast. Faster than money transfer.<p>- It&#x27;s efficient. Money is not cheap to transfer, even today.<p>- It&#x27;s passive. No mental energy expended or decision making required.<p>- It&#x27;s anonymous. No need for payment details or 3rd party to handle funds.<p>- It&#x27;s secure. Again no need for payment information, there&#x27;s not much ads can do. (Malware is a different problem.)<p>- It&#x27;s accessible. Your wealth doesn&#x27;t determine the amount of content you can get. Everyone can access everything equally.<p>This is fundamentally a question of human behavior and the common reaction is to take things for free when possible. People just do not value content that highly, if at all. You can already see the reaction to rising rates for netflix and spotify even though they provide so much value, certainly more than an equally priced cup of coffee.<p>Add to that the amount of willpower and decisioning it requires to judge whether a piece of content is worth it or not and it&#x27;s clear that this is not a scalable system. Perhaps a &quot;cable subscription&quot; for the internet with time-based billing for each domain might be something that works as a direct-payment option in the future but this is a massive technical, security and privacy challenge the way things are now.<p>I do agree that ads have gotten out of hand recently - however this is an <i>implementation</i> problem. Regulation and standards and enforcement are what&#x27;s needed to fix this. It has nothing to do with the ad model itself which is still the most universally scalable and viable monetization system for content.",1450675490

If you go back and look at the railsconf talk by Hansson in 2006 you can see that the Rails people just wanted something that handled CRUD operations. However, one of the drivers behind REST was to provide web services for machine to machine communication - something that was traditionally done by WSDL files in SOAP. The Rails people didn&#x27;t really have much of a need for HATEOAS, because they were not interested in replacing WSDL files. Primarily they wanted to get away from the 800 pound gorilla that was SOAP services (that back in 2005 was what every Enterprise Java web app was doing). As a result the focus was primarily on PUT/GET/POST/DELETE.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of &quot;REST&quot; API&#x27;s that are actually HTTP/RPC API&#x27;s or quasi-REST API&#x27;s that mix REST for simple things, but then begin exposing RPC calls as the developers ability to manage complexity breaks down.  I&#x27;ve never seen anyone actually using HATEOAS yet (maybe i&#x27;ve been isolated??)<p>Usually when your boss says &quot;And it has to have a REST API!!&quot; That means that 1. It must use the internet, 2. It must return JSON, 3. It uses URLs to do things.  Basically if the above is true it&#x27;s a RESTful API. I think that most developers actually believe that are making a REST API even when they are not - simply because they don&#x27;t really know.<p>Your right about being the new XML buzzword though. 10 years ago if you did web services having WSDL, XSTL, SOAP and XML on a resume meant you were the shiz. Today you have REST and AngularJS on your resume if you do web development. Meh :0",1450674861

The slight performance boosts that JS gives you now - which is the predominant reason it&#x27;s become so popular - won&#x27;t matter as much; if things are so fast that you don&#x27;t need an ajax architecture, you won&#x27;t need front end JS frameworks.",1450674832

But both are basically cheap adaptations of Japanese anime -- draw a few frames with action lines, sell millions of trading cards.<p>Compare that to, say, Spiderman for FOX Kids in the 90s. Every scene was carefully animated and the plot was deep.<p>And to prove it&#x27;s not just nostalgia, there were cheap shows back then too, like all the Power Rangers knockoffs. Anyone remember &quot;Samurai Pizzacats&quot;? Kind of funny, but mostly repetitive power rangers formula.<p>Even Japanese anime knockoffs were better before -- like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.<p>There is still good stuff today but it&#x27;s few and far between.

It&#x27;s like people used to play immersive 3d games, real time strategy games, and now so many play addictive pay-to-accelerate casual nonsense like Farmville or Boom Beach or whatever.

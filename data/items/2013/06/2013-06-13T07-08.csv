Visually dead areas that provoke tension rather than inspiring relaxation. Weight that suffocates, rather than open air to breathe.&quot;<p>Interesting review but silly comments like this are, well, silly! When I see an area of a screen or GUI, I do not feel tension if there is a &quot;visually dead&quot; area. Does anyone else?
How come nobody complained about iOS4 and 5 and 6 in the GUI department? Suddenly they are being seen as old and rubbish, and tension-inducing.<p>Daft writing is sadly colouring an objective review. Having said that, iOS7 does look brighter but some areas look difficult to read. The lack of indication when items are buttons or controls is frustrating, as experienced on Windows 8, aka.

From what I understand, nowadays they treat the disease by basically nuking it with antibiotics. Its probably best to talk with a doctor and see if you can get some more advice from them, or perhaps seek out a dedicated support group online. They&#x27;ll probably have more tips and tricks.<p>That, and do some research on how to prevent the tick bite in the first place. When I was young my mom always made sure to point out that we needed to be careful during the times when lyme disease was most prevalent. If you&#x27;re in an area with a lot of brush and you see deer around, you&#x27;ll want to be careful. Deer ticks are the primary carriers of the disease.

5872771,comment,5869294,5872503,3,0,porker,,,"Plenty of reasons. Firstly, look at how society interacts. &quot;What do you do?&quot; is a frequent conversation starter with new people, and already pigeon holes us by our employment. That starts to build a sense of identity with our work.<p>Then there&#x27;s the vicious reward cycle. Do something right with work and you&#x27;re rewarded with praise, with positive feedback, with kudos. Do something wrong and... well you see where it&#x27;s going. It&#x27;s more subtle than how I train my dog, but not much.<p>And then the tech world is in awe to entrepreneurs and startups, where long hours and being defined by passion for what you do and it being the sole calling in life are the norm. You or I, older now I suspect (I certainly am) may look at it and shake our heads and think of the failed relationships we&#x27;ve seen (the same in any high-powered area of work), but for people without that view it&#x27;s not easy. I had the same way of thinking as the OP, and even now I still get jealous of those who achieve much by having their work as their identity and aim in life.<p>And finally society again. There seems to be a growing expectation this is the norm and the right way, like the acceptance that single parent families are normal and a good way for children to be brought up (don&#x27;t argue with the subject, think about how long that&#x27;s been an accepted view). For ambitious, maybe insecure graduates starting out in work, that&#x27;s a huge sense of competing to &#x27;get to the top&#x27;. Why they&#x27;re not sure, but it sure gives one an identity... or does it?",1371109599

BTW, does anyone know what the bit rate of NFC is? Also, how about sharing data with MULTIPLE people at the same time? Does one need to bump phones with all of them? With wireless you can simply multicast to all of them and save a lot of time and battery.<p>As for non-sharing applications, like tagsfordroid or similar, why not use wireless technology? Instead of tapping your phone against a table or something, just press a button on your phone. If WiFi is too energy-inefficient, then maybe something like ZigBee is a better solution. Maybe the ZigBee radio can be started on-demand when the user wants to use it. Wireless has a non-zero radio range as compared to NFC which makes it much more useful.",1371109569

Because if we had to place bets, my guess is that (1) the NSA is either archiving all of the underlying data flowing across US backbone pipes and using this to reconstruct databases such as Google email archives, or (2) it has access to private SSL keys that let it decrypt content transmitted across SSL, or (3) it has automated the process of issuing FISA requests to the point where the process offers no sensible check on the abuse of power or protection of individual privacy.",1371109136

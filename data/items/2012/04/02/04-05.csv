3786392,comment,3785627,3786285,2,0,barrkel,,,"> <i>I oppose both, but some things are more important than personal safety.</i><p>I'm sure I could be very ""free"" in the anarchy of Somalia, but without safety, effective freedoms are very limited. Quite a lot of government tyranny is needed to create a space for freedom to begin with. A social safety net, subsidized or free college education, socialized medicine (whether through public or universal private coverage), etc.; I consider some of these things fundamental to living a life of freedom rather than fear.<p>> <i>Arguing about the commerce clause is very bizarre, however -- I have to think you don't understand what it's been used for if you're dragging this into a discussion of basic rights.</i><p>Gonzales v. Raich, for example.<p>> <i>I suggest reviewing the SAS's conduct in Northern Ireland.</i><p>I'm not aware of the British prime minister ever standing up in the Commons and effectively announcing the right to kill UK citizens. Government wrongdoing, particularly by security services, are ten a penny in most large states, IMO. These days, in the western world, it's usually governments succumbing to US arm-twisting.<p>I understand that you're invested in defending the US. I, however, don't have a particularly strong motivation to defend the UK; I'm not a UK citizen, I've just lived here for a few years. I'm not interested in attacking the US in this argument. I'm just saying that, as a practical matter, I feel more free, and less afraid of the state, in the UK than I do in the US - and I work for a US company and visit the US multiple times every year for weeks at a time.<p>(If I wanted to attack Parliament's involvement in Ireland, I'd rather point to Cromwell. But those days are past.)<p>> <i>I prefer a country where such evil must be carried out covertly to one in which it is openly accepted.</i><p>If this is your true position, be aware that you have not chosen one of a dichotomy; you have in fact chosen a superset of tyranny. Not just evil acts; but covert evil acts.<p>But, of course, the UK has committed its own share of covert evil acts. I don't think it's ever been caught running a network of secret prisons in modern times, though.",1333342757

(Although I can't interpret ""pragmatic principle"" in any way at all - it makes me think of jumbo shrimp.)<p>So essentially, you see a necessary and causal relationship between fascist ideology and fascist terror, but you don't see a necessary and causal relationship between communist ideology and communist terror.  Or to use the Russian color codes, you see a relationship between White Terror and White ideology, but not between Red Terror and Red ideology.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Terror"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Terror</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Terror"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Terror</a><p>Perhaps you won't take my word for it, but you don't need to - the truth isn't hard to find.  I can guarantee you 100% that almost everyone involved with both these systems of terror was completely drenched in, convinced by, and in thrall to the ideologies they served.<p>General Blokhin, for example, single-handedly murdered a substantial percentage of the Polish aristocracy.  As he is doing so, is his mind a blank?  Or does he conceive himself as freeing the Polish workers and peasants from the grip of the alien, rapacious hereditary nobles?  What do you think?  With every bullet in the back of some stuck-up count's neck, he's bringing Poland closer to equality.<p>You'll no doubt agree on the ideological nature of Nazi crimes.  The ""ordinary men"" of Reserve Police Battalion 101 are in exactly the same boat - in their minds, as they slaughter the Jews of Poland, they think: the Jews caused this war, we are freeing Germany from Jewish oppression.<p>Likewise, as American airmen incinerate hundreds of thousands of German and Japanese civilians, they are thinking: the Huns and the Japs caused this war, now they're paying the price.<p>We cannot know the mind of any of these individuals.   However, the collective propaganda mind of World War II is very easy to recall - all we have to do is read the texts.  There is no shortage of American and Soviet propaganda that, read in context, is just as horrifying as anything Goebbels produced.  Do you want to hear FDR sneering, raving, and lying like something out of Hitler's Greatest Hits?<p><a href=""http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/timeline/411027awp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/timeline/411027awp.html</a><p>So should we excommunicate it all?

3786355,comment,3785534,3786254,3,0,refurb,,,"There really isn't a simple way to find out if a study should be taken seriously or not.<p>What you need to do is read the original literature and pay attention to the details.  Bad studies are usually bad for a few reasons:<p>1. Bad experimental design.  If you are testing hypothesis X, but your study design doesn't control for all the variables, then the data won't really tell you anything.  For example, if you want to see if a high-fat diet increases the risk of cancer and you don't control for smoking or environmental exposure, your data is crap whether it supports or rejects your hypothesis.<p>2. Bad data.  You may have a great experimental design, but if your data isn't strongly supportive of a conclusion, then  it's a weak study.  If we take the above example and compare a high-fat diet to a low-fat diet across 5 different group and 2 groups show no effect, 2 groups are right on the border of being statistically significant and one group is strongly positive, it doesn't really tell you anything.<p>3. Bad conclusions.  The data says one thing, but the author goes ahead and concludes it means something else.  You see this a LOT in bad science.  Again if we take the above example, the data may strongly support that a high-fat diet is bad, but then the author goes ahead and says that all fats are bad.  The data doesn't support this.  This is sort of what the sugar-is-toxic studies do.  Are diets that are hyper-caloric and have a high percentage of carbohydrates derived from simple sugars bad for you?  Most likely.  Should you actively try and exclude them from your diet?  The answer to that is no (and the data doesn't support that conclusion).<p>I was formally trained as a scientist, but no longer work in the lab, but the training on I got in designing experiments (be they in the lab or in marketing) has served me well in filtering out ""crap"" of all sorts.",1333341609

Had to transfer them to my local mainframe, then down to my PC, then cut to a disk.  Typically did that one night and the install the next night.  Depending on how good or bad the beta was it would take a couple of hours, or all night (since I HAD to have a working system the next day).  Was the first time the PC/OS2 folks allowed anyone outside of Boca to participate in the beta testing.<p>Coming from a Mac/XWindows background at the time, I didn't think OS/2 1.3 was all that special.  2.0 ""felt"" much better than either Win 3.1 or System 7 at the time.  But it was so tied to IBM's PS/2 systems that even if you wanted to run it on your home system you were likely out of luck.<p>Compatibility improved over time, but not quickly enough to counter Windows.  Plus the PC/PSG folks did anything and everything they could to require ""most favored nation"" status with OS/2, while at the same time courting Microsoft to ensure Windows '95 ran well out of the gate on the Aptivas, Thinkpads and whatever other brands I can't recall.<p>One of the potential advantages that OS/2 had, which IBM blew, was its TCP/IP stack was pretty good, much, much, much better than what was on Windows at the time ('92-94).  Even then, IBM initially made it a separate package (I have no idea how much it cost) because as we all know, the future is LU6.2 networking over SNA.<p>IBM employee desktops were required to be OS/2 well into 1998-1999.  But since IBM killed off WebExplorer, and Netscape Navigator for OS/2 was always just a little bit too off to be considered serious, many of us were using Windows '95 by late 1996 or early 1997.  I finally made the switch over to Windows '95 permanently in mid-1998 when I realized I couldn't see the ibm.com homepage redesign we were launching.",1333340841

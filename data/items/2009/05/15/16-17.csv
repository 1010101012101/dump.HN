If you only hunt when you're hungry, not only are you determined but you're not wasting resources. If I go out every day and kill a deer because I feel like it, and not because I'm hungry (I'd assume a fully grown deer would probably last me more than a week) I'm going to cause myself major problems. Either A) the deer will get wise to me and any deer anywhere will run at the instant sight/smell of a human; or B) I'll kill all the deer and then I'm stuck trying to kill rats for food.<p>Collecting firewood would likely have a similar problem as option B). When humans get it in their minds to cut down trees for anything other than necessity, historically very bad things have happened to us: the prime example of this is Easter Island. A lesser known example is the Old Kingdom deforestation, which is probably why none of Khufu's descendent's beat his pyramid. The scary thing about both of these incidents, especially Easter Island, is that people would have noticed a rapid increase in wind speeds as the trees disappears, they'd have noticed their crops failing (due to the wind) and yet the island is so small that the person who cut down the very last tree could clearly have seen it was the <i>only</i> tree on the island.<p>I'd say in your example Og the go-getter would likely have killed off all the major wildlife around him such that he had a multi-mile trek every day to gather food.

In the original case of VBScript, if the value had been called ""Unknown"" instead of ""Null,"" it would have saved a lot of confusion.<p>Now when it comes to languages like Java with only one special non-value value, ""null"" or ""Null"" or ""Nothing,"" you have to know the context to know what it means.  It might mean ""this value is unknown,"" ""this value has not been calculated yet,"" ""an invalid value was calculated,"" or ""there's a bug in the program.""  Or it might be overloaded to mean that one or more of those might be true.<p>If exactly one of those special cases is possible in your program, then everything is peachy:  use null to represent that case.  If you need to represent zero or more than one of those cases, then you'll end up with some kind of ugliness or imprecision.",1242404373

Those system calls are the same on Linux, MacOS (IA-32 version) and Windows. That could make this very useful - the same executable can run on all major platforms.<p>Note that you can't use existing executables. Code has to be recompiled for this environment. Among other things, the ""ret"" instruction has to be replaced with a different, safer sequence. Also, there's no access to the GPU, so games in the browser will be very limited. As a demo, they ported Quake, but the rendering is entirely on the main CPU. If they wanted to support graphics cross-platform, they could put in OpenGL support.<p>Executable code is pre-scanned by the loader, sort of like VMware. Unlike VMware, the hard cases are simply disallowed, rather than being interpreted. Most of the things that are disallowed you wouldn't want to do anyway except in an exploit.<p>This sandbox system makes heavy use of some protection machinery in IA-32 that's unused by existing operating systems. IA-32 has some elaborate segmentation hardware which allows constraining access at a fine-grained level. I once looked into using that hardware for an interprocess communication system with mutual mistrust, trying to figure out a way to lower the cost of secure IPC. There's a seldom-used ""call gate"" in IA-32 mechanism that almost, but not quite, does the right thing in doing segment switches at a call across a protection boundary. The Google people got cross-boundary calls to work with a ""trampoline code"" system that works more like a system call, transferring from untrusted to trusted code. This is more like classic ""rings of protection"" from Multics.<p>Note that this won't work for 64-bit code. When AMD came up with their extension to IA-32 to 64 bits, they decided to leave out all the classic x86 segmentation machinery because nobody was using it. (I got that info from the architecture designer when he spoke at Stanford.) 64-bit mode is flat address space only.</i><p><a href=""http://tech.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1056231&cid=26048381"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tech.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1056231&cid=260...</a>",1242404361

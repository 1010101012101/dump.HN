I'll go for Python 3 no later than when I absolutely have to.<p>1) Scoping: there's no nested lexical scoping but only function and global scope. Makes many unnecessary workarounds necessary. 2) Read-only closures: you have to use the list hack, you can't just assign to any closed-over vars. 3) No do-while. Surprisingly often needed and thus irritating. 4) Some shortcomings aren't inherent in Python: while I would always like to prefer generators over lists and list comprehensions, and consider iterators elegant, I started considering iterators and itertools as cumbersome and old-fashioned right after I saw lazy sequences in action in Clojure. 5) Various function and method names that I just never, ever recall without first rethinking it again. Like dict.setdefault() which is actually dict.get() but with a default value. There's probably a dozen of these, and each time I just wonder: why is it so difficult to properly rename a few functions and gradually deprecate the old ones. 6) Last, the classical ""there are no proper anonymous functions"": lambda doesn't cut it and having to specifically name ""anonymous"" functions is cumbersome. Combined with scoping limitations, even using a generic name like ""_"" for local functions to be passed as arguments can cause trouble.<p>There used to be more but I have done less and less with Python recently and much more with Clojure, so the irks are fading.",1278563878

1496448,comment,1496165,1496386,0,0,barrkel,,,"Spreadsheets are also arguably dataflow languages, albeit with single values rather than continuous or streams of discrete values (though this changes when you're using a Solve function, or playing around with scenarios). But they benefit from not being programmed in a visual way - i.e. the expressions are normally textual, even if they are marked up (e.g. referenced cells highlighted) to aid understanding.<p>That is, dataflow orientation is distinct from being visual.<p>I implemented a dataflow-like language for UI binding in a web framework once upon a time, and it worked very well. Changes to domain objects in business rules were reflected on the web front end without explicit effort on the programmer's behalf, other than binding expressions associated with the front end's control layout description. The update responses to front end requests (e.g. button click events) were communicated via minimal AJAX, because the binding knew only to send an update when a calculated value actually changed.<p>But having had all this experience, I would still not recommend using a graphical language for it except for UI control positioning.",1278561711

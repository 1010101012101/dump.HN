Not so sure about chemical processors - I still expect the pay off from this research to be fantastically beneficial for all sorts of domains.",1248526793
723223,comment,722517,722690,0,0,cschwarm,,,"If you're really serious about learning the science, the best way is to use a textbook. Back in my days, the most recommended one was ""Economics"" by Paul Samuelson and William Nordhaus, I believe. In fact, it's been in print since 1948, so that it's probably the most successful economic textbooks of all time.<p>However, it seems to have lost some traction in recent years. My impression is that ""Principles of Economics"" by N. Gregory Mankiw took its place. If Mankiw's ""Principles"" is written as clearly as his Macroeconomics textbook, it's certainly worth to start with it.<p>Of course, both are quite expensive and -- depending on your math education -- demanding. So, as a test whether textbooks are something you could like, you may like to start with the free textbook by R. Preston McAfee's ""Introduction to Economic Analysis"". It's available here:<p><a href=""http://www.introecon.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.introecon.com/</a><p>As an alternative, you may like to look for smaller textbooks that mix formal and applied economics. They may be demanding but also somewhat practical. The later part may make it easier to get the former part. As a disadvantage, they don't provide much overview. Among those I've read and can recommend, are:<p>* ""Managerial Economics"" by Ian Dobbs, and<p>* ""Games for Business and Economics"" by Roy Gardner.<p>Of course, if you're interested in something more entertaining and less formal, there are quite a few books that have been published after the success of ""Freakonomics"" by Steven Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner.<p>Unfortunately, none of them are really introductions to the field. They all try to make the point that economics, in general, is interesting by presenting random collections of interesting ideas or stories. Most of them also concentrate on the author's own research which is hardly a good start.<p>That said, they are still entertaining to read. So, you may like to look at the following ones:<p>* ""The Undercover Economist"" by Tim Harford<p>* ""Naked Economics"" by Charles Wheelan<p>I've read the first one and he covers a rather broad selection of topics. I didn't read the second one but the reviews at Amazon made me put it on my wish-list.<p>So, Henry Hazlitt's book is still unique and worth reading, since it covers one of the more basic idea of economics without using any formal means. Just beware that it's outdated (since it's been written much research has gone into the problem of market failure), and that it's somewhat opinionated.<p>Of course, the later is a general problem in economics: researchers usually assume a rather simple utility function of public decision makers, namely to maximize public welfare. This is hardly the only possible one, just the only one people can agree upon.",1248526756

If they want to be outside the interlinked web, just let them go there. Don't link to them. Consequently, the search engines also shouldn't link to them. If they want to be in an empty room - just leave them there.<p>It won't take long and they'll <i>beg</i> to become noticed. In a few years, maybe they'll turn the corner, maybe they'll sink into insignificance. Who cares?",1248526737

Coincidences, faces, conspiracies and their ilk just leap to the forefront of our attention.... I wonder if their couldn't be a little bit of this phenomena at work in this study?

723218,comment,722517,723070,0,0,pbhjpbhj,,,"Minimum wage only means those below that wage become an increased cost to their employer. It doesn't necessarily mean that the highstreet price changes. If the market won't accept a higher price then the employer simple absorbs the cost and lives with a couple less refuelings of their private jet that year. That could potentially hurt the oil companies slightly but they just decide to cut production and charge more. The refuelers get an extra tea-break. If the price does go up then for commodities the gross profit of the owners is likely to increase - who buys less bread because the price went up by 0.0001p to account for minimum wage (rounded up to 1p, guess who gets to bank the rounding error!).<p>Moving on.<p>In an anarchic society (no government) ""private security firms"" do enforce law and order. The problem is that the law is ""whoever is strongest (has most weapons, most money to pay their army) wins"". That's it. Out of that grows a feudal system.<p>I'm quite glad that Christianity took hold of those in positions of power and brought us beyond that. But do feel were sliding back in that direction rather.",1248526379

723203,comment,723184,723184,0,0,tokenadult,,,"All linguists know that there are plenty of examples of languages in which personal pronouns don't distinguish gender, including Chinese. I have a visitor these days, a friend from Taiwan, and he can reliably confuse ""he"" and ""she"" in English (for example, by talking about his wife but then saying ""he"" or by talking about his son and then saying ""she"") because he, like most native speakers of Sinitic languages, fundamentally doesn't see a need to distinguish gender in personal pronouns.<p>I've been an editor enough years to know that ""they"" is not accepted as a pronoun referring to an antecedent in the singular number in standard written English, but I sure SPEAK English that way, and observe plenty of other native speakers of English speaking that way or even writing that way. I've also been around enough radical feminists to know that they think ""he"" is offensive as a general reference to an unknown person, even though that is the typical default in Indo-European languages (equivalents to ""it"" are disfavored because they imply the antecedent is not animate). I often structure sentences so that the sentences don't have personal pronouns, when I think my readership might take offense at nonstandard grammar or at ""sexist"" language. An astute observer of human society might notice that languages without gender in personal pronouns don't seem particularly to occur in societies without sexism, so perhaps an assumption that ""sexist"" language makes any kind of difference in people's behavior is unwarranted.

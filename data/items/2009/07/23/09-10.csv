719270,comment,718132,718132,0,0,ErrantX,,,"There is no message in this post, no ""good points"" (to a point). Clearly the writer has no experience of Chinese culture or has ever really been there (I know its satire - but the point is to make a point, no?).<p>Considering cultures in Asia/Africa (possibly even South America) from a Western perspective will always lead you to draw conclusions such as ""slave labour"" and ""abuse"".<p>Now, I'm not going to deny for a moment that such things do go on - but not in quite the same way and on the scale certain people wish to imagine.<p>Anecdote from my university course: our dept. was open 24/7 (even on Sundays if you had a special pass). I would regularly walk past the lobby at 1am and see the Chinese continget (there were many on my course) still working there. We tried to get some to come to a pub once and they didnt really get the whole relaxing/chilling out thing.<p>It was an interesting insight into the culture - and when I was lucky enough to travel in some of the less well known areas of Asia you see it in even more detail. Greater thabn 40hr weeks are not borne out of the manufacturers getting more out of the labour. It is borne out the culture (and, yes, they took advantage of it).",1248342381

Even if the factories are ""no prisons"" etc. People in China live in the factories and sleep in dorms because they work 7 days a week for a wage that does not even allow them to pay rent. Even in case they could afford a flat they wouldn't have the time to go back and forth after a 12 - 14h workday.",1248341786

Patents are crucial protection on an invention - but it would be nice to have a time limit in the law; requiring the patent holder to prove that they only found out about the infringement within the last X years/months.",1248340842

719258,comment,717826,717863,0,0,Tichy,,,"""but it works, it generally works well, is very well documented, and can be easily enhanced by myself or someone else.""<p>Yeah, but maybe for you ""excellent, clean code"" means you have moved everything into XML configuration files. I thought the general consensus was that real experts can never know that they are experts, therefore your claims would make me wary of your skills.<p>Isn't there always a way to write things even better, cleaner, more effective, more modular, whatever? In that sense I think all of my code sucks. I am sure some people out there write worse code than I do, but I am also sure there is much better code.<p>If you think you are so good, are you even still trying to improve yourself?<p>The only way I see to write ""perfect"" code is to adhere to some standard perfectly. Like J2EE development: you have strict rules for putting stuff into XML files and so on. So if you did all that, and raked in the money, you can call your code ""perfect"". It would still suck, though.",1248340480

If it's true, however, that the XO spawned the netbook than OLPC has succeeded in an indirect way.  First netbooks, then kindle, then Apple's answer to the netbook, then the commoditization of these products, then hopefully the ubiquity of these devices brings cost to a point where something like the XO vision ends up in the hands of the children by shear momentum.  Negroponte, and OLPC, has been a catalyst.  Don't deny them that much!",1248340395

Well, one of them has been drawn on by the 2 year old who loves to play TamTamJam on it, but thats all.  Everything else is borked, and to be honest I just can't be bothered administering the thing.

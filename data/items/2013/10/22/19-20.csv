By all accounts, Forstall was one of the driving forces behind the iOS aesthetic that Lion and Mountain Lion so enthusiastically embraced. Jony Ive&#x27;s iOS 7 strikes off in a bold new direction based on a philosophy that Apple is eager to generalize to the company as a wholeleaving OS X holding the stitched-leather bag.<p>Not exactly sullying his name. There has been a design shift, it&#x27;s fairly striking, at least on the surface, and it seems to be tightly coupled with a changing of the guard.<p>The story that will go down in history is Scott Forstall was the skeu guy, and he got the boot so Ive could flat-iron everything. We don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true, but unless Apple tells us otherwise, it fits the data we have better than most things.",1382471986

6594517,comment,6593855,6594437,4,0,corresation,,,"On a tablet, bigger doesn&#x27;t equal better, and a very common sentiment is that the Mini is the ideal size, with the iPad full-sized being unwieldy for many uses (any situation where you hold it in your hand). So I&#x27;m not ignoring screen size, but quite contrary am saying that smaller, in this case, for many purposes == better. Obviously that is to a point, but for common uses the iPad Mini is very close to perfect.<p>To put it another way, now that Apple has equalized the hardware (same resolution, processor, accouterments), they could legitimately pitch the Mini as the more expensive, premium device (fitting more capabilities in a smaller space). Of course they couldn&#x27;t only because they originally intro&#x27;d the mini as the discount device, but had they not it would be a legitimate angle.",1382471941

Can&#x27;t speak for a project with this scope, but the procurement middlemen get into everything, far for the worse.<p>Two years ago our team wanted to buy a small cluster (~300 cores, ~$50K).  We talked directly to two good vendors (good recommendations from university partners) and came up with a fine machine and 2 bids for it.  Sent recommendations to procurement.<p>Procurement put it out for bid, and a fly-by-night company undercut the bid by $10K... by noticing that procurement had not specified details of service level (that were in the bids we&#x27;d gotten and forwarded).  Procurement, once it goes there, is a true black box.  No communication, no understanding.<p>Five months later, we were basically delivered 2 pallets of unassembled parts and no instructions.  Believe me, we spent 3-4x as much in labor as the $10K savings to get it working, and it&#x27;s been plagued with issues that would have been under the onsite service warranties for the better companies.<p>The biggest irony is: I firmly believe that procurement acts this way not because the government is fundamentally incompetent, but because the Public, and thus Congress, BELIEVES we are incompetent, so puts so many levels of &quot;check&quot; bureaucracy in place that the people who know what they want can&#x27;t participate directly in getting it.",1382471816

From the undercover reporting articles on Amazon&#x27;s warehouses, there aren&#x27;t labor unions.<p>Amazon does provide a lot that stores don&#x27;t, but now you&#x27;re asking what is the outcome of your choice for yourself, not for others. There is a lot of that same focus in the comments here.<p>Counterexamples of people who work in stores and don&#x27;t enjoy their jobs are perfectly valid. I would focus, though, on what my choice of where I spend money offers as an opportunity to others. The opportunity in the warehouse depresses me. The opportunity in the store seems pretty OK.<p>I, too, want what Amazon has to offer, and those who can pay taking what is offered them is the way of the world, but I still have to make my own choice.",1382471504

This was already the case in the US and there is no government mandate for it to be that way.<p>History please.<p>The USB-socket-in-the-phone standard for recharging phones started once China demanded _de jure_ in 2006 that all data-enabled phones could be recharged using mini/micro-USB. That request had a huge impact: at that time Nokia produced phones with data-only USB ports that could not be used to charge the phone. Suddenly &quot;+1&quot; and &quot;C&quot; models of Nokia&#x27;s phone started appearing, all with the ability to charge using the USB port. Initially these models where sold only in Asia, then the producers started selling them everywhere, just to streamline the production.<p>Then, in 2008, the EU Commission asked the producers of mobile handsets to agree on a standard, whatever standard. If they could not came up with a single solution the Commission threatened that they would _impose_ a solution.<p>In 2010 all the big producers agreed to use micro USB. That was an easy choice, as they were already forced to use it for all the phones sold in China.<p>In 2010/2011 the CEN and ETSI standardization bodies sat down and produced a spec that mirrors the micro-USB spec.<p>Now, in 2013, the EU is about to set the CEN spec in stone.<p>Governments played a big role here. China&#x27;s regulations first and EU &quot;pressure&quot; later is what lead us to the current status.",1382471462

In the world today, the company is governed by the extant investors (not the ones that give them money to start up or IPO).

In a normal world, the investors would tend to default to management provided that management is generating &quot;returns on investment&quot; in relation to the Capital at risk in the organization.

The only reason Amazon&#x27;s &quot;free&quot; shipping is slow to this region is likely because they probably hold orders destined for a specific area or zip code until they can get a bulk shipping rate on all of the items and send them out via the same carrier. I&#x27;ve speculated about this before because Amazon will happily hold onto items for 1-2 weeks via free shipping that will arrive within 2-3 days after they&#x27;ve been marked as &quot;shipped.&quot; Amazon Prime shipped items usually arrive within 2 days, and like you, I&#x27;m pretty sure those are overnight ground.",1382470945

Startups are more successful in the Valley compared to anywhere else, because the early adopters are in the valley too. These early adopters/customers allow a startup to know what to build, know when to pivot and know when to scale. Facebook was created in Harvard.

That year was an aberration, with a costly acquisition weighing the company down, but previous years have been similar. 2011 saw just $631m net income on worldwide sales of $48bn, and in 2010  the company&#x27;s most profitable year to date  it scraped $1.15bn of profit on revenue of $34bn.</i><p>631/48000=?<p>1,15/34=?<p>Those are your margins.

However, in that time period, they never released a product nor gained customers.<p>Since I&#x27;ve joined, a product has been released (100% my IP); we&#x27;ve gained a few customers; I&#x27;ve managed to narrow the scope of the business while honing in on our core value proposition.<p>Currently, the startup only has two people working on it - myself and the original founder. He had a couple other co-founders work on it over the years, but due to various uncontrollable factors, they are no longer working on the product.<p>When I signed on, I agreed to a status as co-founder and 25% equity, which I thought was fine. Now I know any percent of essentially $0 valuation is still 0, but I can&#x27;t help feel I&#x27;ve really brought life into this startup and my contribution is more significant than 25%. The orginal co-founder, I recently found out, has around 60% equity, while the rest belongs to the other original founders (vesting, I guess).<p>I have 0 complaints about the original founder.

To fix this set a convenient and flexible work schedule for yourself. Try to maintain those hours, so you know you are off work anytime after those hours. You can also mix it up, work long hours some days and less hours on other days.<p>Another downside is friends and family will think you have all the time in the world, even though they mean well, they will often try to fit some favor into your schedule, like pick up the niece, the friend from the airport, help me move etc. You need to know how much you can help your friends and still be productive.",1382469117

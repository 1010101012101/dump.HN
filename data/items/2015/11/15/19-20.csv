10570877,comment,10570258,10570605,0,0,powertower,,,"To myself, a good start would be to ask what the social and economic costs of allowing 5 million Muslims into France has been?<p>As far as I&#x27;ve been able to uncover, when you put all the politically-correct rederick away, the driver of this has been the fact that Europeans have not been having enough children to economically replace and support all the people that are now retiring... Basically, there needs to be more <i>tax-payers</i> to cover everything and to balance the books.<p>So is this working out?<p>Are Muslims as a group embracing European values and becoming individuals / or are they maintaining their group and forming a parallel society, which is largely unskilled, xenophobic, closed-minded, and predominantly seeks welfare from the state?<p>Considering that the Muslim population in France (and other European countries) overall negatively impacts every single metric of social-ills, and with a grim European economic outlook (manual labor is no longer needed, gainful employment requires skills, those jobs are few, etc), I think that whatever this is, it has failed.<p>The first step to the solution is to drop the white-guilt act and call a spade a spade. This will open the door to actual debate instead of shutting it down with words like &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;bigot&quot; for simply not being politically-correct.<p>The second step is to stop importing &quot;other cultures&quot; into Europe. The human race has been based on groups/collectives since its inception, with each group producing, collecting, and evolving individuals <i>of similar attributes and behaviors</i>. Put two groups together that are too different, you&#x27;ll likely get violence.<p>The third step is trying out a program similar to Sweden&#x27;s to try to integrate the existing Muslim population with special targeted resources. But only to a point - not ongoing forever. And designed to grow European values, not to preserve or maintain a parallel society.<p>The forth step is likely some type of a guaranteed minimum income based on negative income tax across the entire EU system (as proposed by Milton Friedman).",1447617208

Older btrfs userspace such as your v3.17 is &quot;OK&quot; for normal runtime use, assuming you don&#x27;t need any newer features, as in normal runtime, it&#x27;s the kernel code doing the real work and userspace for the most part simply makes the appropriate kernel calls to do that work.<p>But, once you get into a recovery situation like the one you&#x27;re in now, current userspace becomes much more mportant, as the various things you&#x27;ll do to attempt recovery rely far more on userspace code directly accessing the filesystem, and it&#x27;s only the newest userspace code that has the latest fixes.&quot;<p>If you look, you see that the guy reporting the problem was using a <i>very</i> new kernel, but a <i>one-year</i>-old btrfs-tools package. It makes no sense to use tools that are <i>substantially</i> older than the kernel you&#x27;re running. He <i>might</i> have had much better luck with recovery (that is, he might have been able to get a rw volume with all his data, rather than an ro volume -<i>with all his data</i>- out of the process) with a recent tools package.<p>> <a href=""http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-btrfs/msg47845.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-btrfs/msg47845.html</a><p>Maybe I&#x27;m reading <i>this</i> one wrong, but it looks like the summary of the issues are:<p>* For multi-disk arrays with disks of varying sizes, each smaller disk does not receive data until all larger disks have as much or less free space than the smaller disk in question. [0]<p>* The read scheduling algo is currently naive, using PID evenness to determine the disk in a pair to read, rather than current IO load on the disk.<p>Did I miss something, or misunderstand something? If I didn&#x27;t miss anything, I don&#x27;t see how you can get &quot;RAID is utterly broken&quot; from &quot;RAID has less-than-optimal write and read scheduling&quot;.<p>> * It&#x27;s useless for databases or VM images (disabling datacow is a ugly hack IMHO)<p>I can&#x27;t agree. I use btrfs on spinning rust to store my multi-terabyte Postgres 9.4 DB. It works well enough for my low-to-medium-volume [1] workload.<p>> * Lot&#x27;s of ENOSPC bugs (just look at the mailing list)<p>I don&#x27;t run into those, and haven&#x27;t for literal <i>years</i>.<p>> * Quota is utterly broken...<p>Yes, quota is a difficult problem that continues to be unsolved.<p>> * You need to run the latest kernel...<p>Yes.

Happily, it only blocked operation on the affected file. The remainder of the system kept running along, and a -ugh- reboot unblocked the operation. [2]<p>Look. I&#x27;m not saying that btrfs is feature-complete, suitable for <i>every</i> workload, or that any given person <i>should</i> use it for <i>their</i> workload. I&#x27;m just saying that the situation is <i>far</i> less dire than you&#x27;re making it out to be. I&#x27;ve been using it as the rootfs for at <i>least</i> one of my daily use systems for the past 5.5 years, and haven&#x27;t had <i>any</i> trouble out of it [3] in the past 2+ years.<p>[0] That phrasing was abysmal. Here&#x27;s an example: Given an array of one each of 3GB, 2GB, 1.5GB devices. the 2GB device will get data after 1GB has been written to the 3GB device. The 1.5GB device will get data after 0.5GB of additional data has been written to each of the 3GB and 2GB devices (making a total of 1GB additional data written to the array before the 1.5GB device starts getting data). AIUI, if you&#x27;re running in RAID1 mode, then the same logic applies, but with paired devices.<p>[1] Most definitely <i>not</i> web-scale workload.<p>[2] I don&#x27;t know if a unmount/remount cycle would have <i>also</i> worked.

They are someone&#x27;s father, mother, child or sibling.<p>Right off the bat you lead with a red herring appeal to emotion, you&#x27;ve already left the realm of reasoned debate by starting off a logical fallacy.  This is the premise of your argument, it is fallacious, you cannot build a rational argument on a fallacious premise.<p>> That&#x27;s where cold statistics fail us. Nobody should tolerate the idea of people being killed by the hundreds every so often in a theater or futbol field and argue that they are &quot;a fraction of a fraction of percent&quot;. Sorry, that&#x27;s just sick.<p>It&#x27;s not sick, it&#x27;s realistic and rational; statistics aren&#x27;t failing us, they&#x27;re showing you the truth that your emotions are blinding you to, that this simply isn&#x27;t a big problem compared to all the other ways people die in far greater numbers.  More people die in mass from plane crashes.  Here&#x27;s the CDC&#x27;s top 10 leading causes of death in the US.<p><pre><code>  Heart disease: 611,105\n  Cancer: 584,881\n  Chronic lower respiratory diseases: 149,205\n  Accidents (unintentional injuries): 130,557\n  Stroke (cerebrovascular diseases): 128,978\n  Alzheimer&#x27;s disease: 84,767\n  Diabetes: 75,578\n  Influenza and Pneumonia: 56,979\n  Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and nephrosis: 47,112\n  Intentional self-harm (suicide): 41,149\n</code></pre>\nIt is quite clear in context, that terrorism just isn&#x27;t a real problem, it&#x27;s not even in an order of magnitude of the realm of a real problem, certainly not one worth destroying liberty for.<p>> The problem with this logic is that automobile accidents are a matter of statistics and probability.

Your reaction is emotional and wildly out of proportion with the size of the problem. Terrorism only changes the world because of the inappropriate reactions of emotionally driven people who happily give up freedoms to power hungry people totally willing to have more control over the populace.  The problem isn&#x27;t terrorism, the problem is your reaction to it, which is the goal of terrorism.  By being so emotional, you are quite literally letting the terrorist win as this is their goal.  If you want to beat terrorism, stop being terrorized, suppress your emotions, and use reason instead; that&#x27;s how you beat terrorism.<p>Terrorism is simply crime, you cannot eradicate crime and your attempts to do so make the world worse for those who currently enjoy freedom. It is the actions of those like you, in your attempts to &quot;protect&quot; people, that makes terrorism worse.  As long as there are people, there will be terrorism, accept it, stop overreacting to it, and you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s not the big problem your emotions make it out to be.",1447616125

If one is slow, then there might be a lineup of 4 cars in a row, and that&#x27;s more likely then a simple calculation based on 1-(1-p)^4 where p is the single car density.<p>Then twice a day there&#x27;s the school bus. And there&#x27;s the occasional cattle truck, and semi, and anhydrous tanker. So you might have a school bus with a couple of heavy vehicles behind it, as a possible maximum design load.<p>The odds of this can&#x27;t be described with a simple Gaussian, so standard deviations make no sense.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s no need to go crazy overboard and design all bridges to handle a convoy of M1 Abrams tanks. That&#x27;s why rural bridge might have a posted weight limit of, say, 10 tons, with only 1 truck allowed at a time. Even then, some people will push the limits, which is why there&#x27;s a safety factor.<p>For example <a href=""http://blogs.mcall.com/roadwarrior/2014/08/wehrs-mill-bridge-reopens-with-four-ton-weight-limit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.mcall.com/roadwarrior/2014/08/wehrs-mill-bridge...</a> describes a wooden bridge which had a 10 ton limit, until some dumbass fuel tanker weighing 38.2 tons went through. Now the rated limit is 4 tons because of the structural damage.<p>So it&#x27;s not &quot;the maximum that was ever recorded in the dataset of all rural bridges&quot; but &quot;the maximum expected for this bridge&quot;, along with efforts to restrict higher loads.",1447615080

Propellor ground clearance is also an issue for the larger types.<p>> Unlike the An-124, the An-225 was not intended for tactical airlifting and is not designed for short-field operation\n> It still has high wing.<p>The An-225 carries cargoes of unusual bulk to unusual places. Being able to get these cargoes on and off the aircraft without some sort of lift has advantages.<p>Low-wing freighters, which are all variants of passenger types these days, almost always carry palletized cargo of standard dimensional units (See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_load_device"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_load_device</a>) - this allows for standardized ground handling equipment for most loads.<p>> And U2 has high wing. It&#x27;s probably the plane with most carefully calculated weight ever.\n> If it was inherently heavier, this would make no sense.<p>The U2 is not a high-wing aircraft, it is a mid-wing aircraft with its spar roughly running through its center of gravity. This is actually the most efficient and aerodynamically cleanest configuration, and many high-performance aircraft use this arrangement. The main problem with it for passenger or cargo use is that the wing structure ends up interfering with the middle of the fuselage volume near the center of gravity, which tends to be valuable space in a transport aircraft.",1447615005

The bald assertion that &quot;Installing a website itself is of no service to most clients who can accomplish the same in a couple of hours with a cheap host providing a detailed guide on their website&quot;, must be false. At least two hours of technically knowledgeable work is definitely a worthwhile service, and deserves adequate remuneration. The next sentence, about &quot;providing real value&quot; doesn&#x27;t stand up, then, because such WordPress Devs <i>are</i> providing real value.<p>There&#x27;s no reason why success should require taking on custom projects for larger businesses, when there is an ample market of small businesses and new businesses that are well-served with just WordPress and plugins.",1447614261

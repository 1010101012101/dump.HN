Most people who succeed in business are usually (but not in all cases) brought up in good homes, in stable social environments and receive good educations. Pull beneath the curtain and even the &#x27;high school/college drop out&#x27; is usually from a middle class home or has received private education. There are many other things that play a role as well including race. Remember all the kerfuffle a year or two ago about the lack of entrepreneurs from ethnic minority groups namely black groups who weren&#x27;t being funded. Its not part of the &#x27;VC Pattern Recognition&#x27;. Believe me it also pained me to write about race because I&#x27;ve v low tolerance for it.<p>Furthermore, there is clear evidence across the most wildly successful companies you will see many entrepreneurs do look very similar. Many have similar upbringings, many have good educations/come from good homes, many are from specific sections in the class hierarchy and many are from specific races. Just look at most of the top venture investors most are white or jewish.<p>Persistence yes i agree is unbelievably important. By default telling many people you&#x27;ll start a business will likely result in a mix bag of congrats but many people telling you why it is a bad idea or why it won&#x27;t work.<p>However, please do not be so dismissive of IQ or social environment or education. All of these things play a key role.<p>Look at the S&P 500. The CEOs education is as follows 97% have a college degree and 67% have a further degree. Most common degrees are engineering. Stanford and Harvard have 4% of the CEO population in the 500. I will also include Zuckerburg/Gates in this stat even if he dropped out he still went!<p>Please do not be so dismissive of other factors it is just myopic and extremely ignorant.",1400169391

She claims that she achieved this by getting a good nights sleep every night (i.e. 9 hours). She claims that this is what enabled her to qualify to do medicine also. All her classmates in college did exactly what kamaal describes (I have done it myself). They worked all the hours they could get because they were so afraid they wouldn&#x27;t make it. And they passed their exams. But they didn&#x27;t get a first. She said she spoke to a few of them a few times saying how ineffective this was, that medicine is hard and to build up a mental map and solid understanding you need sleep. As a well slept person she could see how ineffective they were. But it takes discipline and confidence (and maybe a bit of devil may care) not to panic and most people don&#x27;t seem to be able to do this in the face of what they think are very tough odds.<p>My own observation on programming (significantly less taxing than studying medicine - no matter how you slice it) is that you can do a few late nights but after that it becomes drastically ineffective and the people involved get more and more dunning kruger about it.

7750078,comment,7749641,7749641,7,0,michaelochurch,,,"This is a pretty shallow analysis, and I don&#x27;t find it useful.<p>&quot;The Business&quot; is mostly full of non-technical people who, while they might not be analytical or even as smart, but who understand politics well and know how to solve the local optimization of seeking their own careers and power. They don&#x27;t want &quot;more features! now!&quot; Their motivations are things like (a) making their mark, (b) concentrating a power base, and (c) tying their names to an obvious, low-risk opportunity for visible gain. The reason they want &quot;features&quot; is that everyone who gets power needs to use it to make some kind of mark in order to retain that power. Programmers tend to underestimate &quot;business idiots&quot; while refusing to acknowledge that those &quot;idiots&quot; being in charge means that they&#x27;re good at <i>something</i>.<p>Programmers don&#x27;t want &quot;more refactoring!&quot; out of some knee-jerk defensiveness. The good ones want <i>technical excellence</i>, which dies in deadline culture. They want to build things they can be proud of. And there are careerist reasons for them to feel this way, because tech gets shit on as soon as things go bad, no matter who&#x27;s really at fault. If you build a system that generates $50 million per year, then make a mistake that causes 4 hours of downtime ($23,000 loss) of that system, you&#x27;ll typically be mortally embarrassed and possibly fired. So, programmers have solid,m career-oriented reasons to push back when asked to do something in a quick, sloppy way. They (and not the managers who ordered them to cut corners) will be the ones to suffer when things fall apart.<p>The hard and painful truth is that business-oriented programming is underappreciated by business and unattractive to talented programmers, and so almost a complete non-starter. The good people tend to fight for a while (for more refactoring, more autonomy) but eventually disengage or go elsewhere (e.g. consulting, where there&#x27;s an outside chance of getting what they&#x27;re actually worth). The bad programmers don&#x27;t care about &quot;refactoring&quot; per se but have learned how to parrot the good ones. Thus far, VCs have tried to overcome this problem (the complete non-viability of business-oriented programming) with the smoke-and-mirrors show of startups and paper millionaires, but the wiser people are starting to figure that one out, too.<p>For the record, there isn&#x27;t a huge mismatch between &quot;The Business&quot; and &quot;The Programmers&quot;. Great programmers are <i>perfectly happy</i> working for the business, if compensated appropriately (see: quant traders at hedge funds) or if they own it. They just don&#x27;t like working for the business <i>as a subordinate</i>, because it leads to spending a lot of time implementing <i>stupid</i> features that obviously don&#x27;t make sense or deliver value to the company, but that meet the parochial needs of a specific ambitious executive (who won&#x27;t protect them in return for their service).",1400168533

You can already buy all the CNC mills and lathes and other machine tools that you have space and money for, and use them to manufacture firearms if you want to. Granted, it takes a lot more time and money than using 3D printers.<p>At least in the US, the laws are pretty clear and established on manufacturing firearms, and I don&#x27;t see how they would be any different for 3D printed guns. Right now, as an individual, you can manufacture and posses any firearm that meets the legal definition of a pistol, rifle, or shotgun with no licenses at all, unless prohibited by state laws. You only need a license if you want to sell them. AFAIK, you can actually sell the guns you build, as long as you aren&#x27;t believed to be in the business of manufacturing them for sale, which is a bit of a fuzzy line.<p>If you want to manufacture anything full-auto, anything explosive, or certain other categories of weapons, then you need a special manufacturer&#x27;s license for that, regardless of what you plan to do with them, and are much more strictly prohibited on who you can sell them to and how. AFAIK, currently, any newly manufactured full-auto firearm can only be sold legally to either police departments or other licensed dealers.<p>Nevertheless, this is still an interesting field, and I&#x27;d like to see what the 3D printing innovators manage to come up with as far as useful firearms.",1400168429

I&#x27;m afraid that this may end up being flamebait, but here goes...<p>These reformed Math programs are a tremendous mess being foisted on us by &quot;Education&quot; professionals and academics.  Instead of teaching one, well-tested method of performing operations (addition, subtraction, etd.), these programs present a number of alternative &quot;algorithms&quot;.  In <i>Everyday Math</i> (the program my own kids were taught), the standard methods for multiplication and division were not taught and years of drill using alternative (and inferior) methods were used.  This leads to tentative confusion over the way to solve problems.  Proficiency with basic multiplication and so forth is downplayed and instead proficiency with calculators is developed.<p>The Education majors (teachers and professors of Education) aren&#x27;t STEM people themselves.  I remember how we, the parents, were lectured (during the parent introduction to these programs) on mathematics and how, we were informed, &quot;there is more than one way to get to an answer&quot; as if this was some astonishing revealed truth.  How there was (are you ready for this?) more than one way to do multiplication.  Then the teachers would illustrate some method (for example, the Lattice method of paper and pencil multiplication) and with wide and astonished eyes exclaim, &quot;see it gives the SAME result&quot;.  Now, for those that don&#x27;t know the Lattice method, its just a method of doing multi-digit multiplication that keeps the intermediate products, which will eventually be summed, in a grid.<p>Many years ago I was taught the standard methods for computing the basic operations because after centuries of use they have become the prefered methods by people that have to work with numbers.  That&#x27;s why adults haven&#x27;t bothered to learn the Russian Peasant method or the Egyptian method or whatever. So while our kids will struggle with some new text book, fat and full of colorful pictures that will have pictures of ancient pyramids, the kids in Singapore will by using thin, little black and white books full of exercises, written in English.  And then, the kids in Singapore will go on to absolutely kick our asses in mathematics.  I&#x27;ve used these Singapore math books, somewhere around the summer after third grade, to reteach my own daughter mathematics.  A couple of days ago, she just took the Calculus AP exam after her Junior year in high school, no thanks to <i>Everyday Math</i>.<p>Not everything about <i>Everyday Math</i> nor <i>Common Core</i> is bad, but some of it is really bad.<p>It&#x27;s argued by the people putting these programs in place that they know better and that their programs are supported by research.  Have you looked at this supposed research?  It&#x27;s not good.  Few well controlled studies done by people in Education departments[1].<p>The first (so called) research paper listed on the <i>Everyday Math</i> program web site uses Knuth Vol. 3 as justification for studying so many algorithms.  It completely misses the point of Vol. 3.  It&#x27;s a book about sorting and searching algorithms.  Almost every one of them has some reason for it&#x27;s use: easy code, fast average performance, fast worst case, works well with a limited number of tape drives (wow!), and so on.  This has nothing to do with the desirability of teaching inferior methods of basic calculation to our kids.  This paper, which is used to justify some of the core principles of the <i>Everyday Math</i> program is an example of the poor foundation for these reforms to math education in the US.<p>[1] How Brainy Is Your Major: <a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/finding-the-next-einstein/201108/how-brainy-is-your-major"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/finding-the-next-einstei...</a><p>[2] Algorithms in <i>Everyday Math</i> <a href=""http://everydaymath.uchicago.edu/about/research-results/algorithms.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://everydaymath.uchicago.edu/about/research-results/algo...</a>",1400167509

Here&#x27;s mine:<p>As far as 11th-grade high school english lit writing assignments go, this one is pretty good. I like how the author tells the reader technical things without ever trying to explain them, assuming that his readership is completely familiar with the subject matter. I also like how there&#x27;s virtually no character development whatsoever, the ending is forced, and there&#x27;s no conflict or strife in this idealized post-apocalyptic world. Anyone who would normally fight or kill for resources has apparently died, leaving only calm, rational citizens to share plentiful provisions.<p>My favorite part is how completely emotionally detached the protagonist is. His wife and baby boy dies, and he&#x27;s basically alright about 5 minutes later. Each time he remembers them he seems to feel sad, then forget about them like an alzheimer patient. No shock, no panic, no guilt, no sorrow. Just a completely emotionally dead nerd who&#x27;s more focused on his computers than his real relationships. It puts a realistic face on what could have been just another cypherpunk dystopian piece of drivel.",1400167428

But if the customer&#x27;s payload is within the limit, it just means bolting on legs and adding extra fuel. The total fuel cost of a launch is around $200,000 compared to $60 million total cost for the launch, so the cost of extra fuel is negligible.<p>They&#x27;ve already done it twice (once without the legs and once with) while getting paid to launch payloads. The experimental part doesn&#x27;t come into play until after the first stage has done its primary job, so there&#x27;s no additional risk to the customer.<p>This is why I think ongoing comparisons to the Shuttle and other reusable systems are completely wrong. Previous attempts have all been based on much more complicated and expensive vehicles that were expected to compensate by being reused. SpaceX is taking a system that&#x27;s already one of the cheapest in the business (if not the cheapest?) and making some minor changes to reuse it and make it even cheaper.<p>NASA had to reuse the Shuttle on its second flight ever.

Someone writing code with unit testing in mind would have ensured only one copy of the algorithm existed—not only because it&#x27;s theoretically more proper, but because it would have been easier to test.</i><p>Which is double nonsense. Firstly, because writing unit tests simply don&#x27;t force you not to duplicate code like this. I spend day after day staring at a thoroughly unit-tested codebase which contains duplication like this, along with manifest other crimes. Secondly, because you don&#x27;t need a unit test to force you not to duplicate code like this, you just need to be a competent, conscientious programmer.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, i am a huge fan of testing. This code should have had tests, without doubt. But please don&#x27;t delude yourself into thinking that unit testing is going to lead to high-quality code. If you have sub-par programmers, or decent programmers in a sub-par culture, they will write low-quality code, whether they write unit tests for it or not.",1400166160

If the app pool goes inactive for a time, IIS kills the w3wp process running the app.  You can set the timeout in the web.config (not in front of code right now, don&#x27;t know the exact incantations).  Does WAWS respect that?<p>Though, the shutdown would be a good thing for a small site like what WAWS is intended for, because when the site isn&#x27;t running, it&#x27;s not still using resources.<p>In my company&#x27;s environment (our own datacenter), our monitoring tools keep the app pool from &quot;timing out&quot; because it hits a status page every 2 minutes.

7749811,comment,7748386,7748541,2,0,DaveWalk,,,"> Who tells dying patients they are not allowed them, and is there a black market or large amounts of money changing hands for experimental procedures?<p>The FDA regulates every aspect of clinical trial design. Dying cancer patients are <i></i>always<i></i> the first to receive untested drugs -- the FDA has set the bar that any new therapy must outperform what is currently used. There is no &quot;black market&quot; for experimental procedures, mostly because you must visit a hospital to receive them in the first place. Some drugs are intravenous; all are given with standard oncology examination. A doctor cannot write a prescription for a drug not on the market yet for you to pick up at the pharmacy!<p>> Surely with hundreds of thousands of desperate, dying, last chance sufferers, it is better to go to extreme measures and offer the most promising yet dangerous treatments to everyone. Is it simply a side effect of the way pharmaceutical companies have to do business?<p>In order for the <i>testing</i> of a Phase I trial to be complete, patients must meet certain criteria. The FDA (and, by extension, the pharmaceutical companies who want FDA approval) require enrolled patients in a clinical trial to have similar levels of disease. A patient that is clearly near end of life may not be able to physically swallow a pill...their outcome may bias the trial&#x27;s results.<p>Yes, there are desperate and dying cancer patients, but a Phase I trial can (and should!) only accommodate dozens of them to achieve proper statistical power. Phase II may take hundreds, and Phase III will take even more -- but when a drug is approved, it has the possibility of being given to many thousands or millions of patients all at once.<p>As the trial population grows, medicine rears its stochastic side -- despite patients having pathologically similar disease, some will be helped and others will not. This is at the core of all FDA trial design: big populations are necessary to see just how effective your drug is. It should not be surprising, then, that the majority of failures happen at the bigger scales (PhII and PhIII).",1400166135

These drives were amazing for their time, but I can&#x27;t believe people are still using them regularly.",1388914890

The table editing limitation was eventually fixed but much more serious problems have since cropped up.<p>Sync issues and the unusably slow iOS client caused me to drop it for personal use a few months ago, now it&#x27;s relegated to only work notes with the desktop client. For this really basic purpose it&#x27;s alright, it has a few major  annoyances and the interface has gotten much worse over the years but it&#x27;d be too much effort to migrate to something else and keep my tags/notebooks.<p>This is not a healthy relationship I have with Evernote Corporation. I committed to their product but they didn&#x27;t commit to me.",1388912430

6818486,comment,6817450,6817450,7,0,jjwiseman,,,"I worked on the YouTube ads team (Adsense for interactive media, or AFIM) for a while.<p>The people on that team saw themselves as helping to create the replacement for TV, and part of that job was to create a model that paid the expense of hosting and distributing video, with all the associated infrastructure, as well as allowed for content-creators to make money--basically to make it a viable business.  Ads are the primary means of making that happen, but they&#x27;ve experimented with other methods too.<p>They care a lot about the user. To contradict another poster, they don&#x27;t show ads at every opportunity; that&#x27;s not the Google way, and they have detailed data on exactly how many ads you can show people before they stop watching videos.  They also strongly encourage advertisers to use skippable ads--they make users happier and they encourage more interesting ads (it&#x27;s also not entirely true that advertisers don&#x27;t have to pay for skipped ads).<p>The only thing worse than YouTube ads are the non-Google attempts at video ads.  Google&#x27;s UI and targeting are 10x better than the competition I&#x27;ve seen.<p>(It&#x27;s been over a year since I&#x27;ve worked on AFIM, so my info could be out of date.)",1385715172
6818485,comment,6813120,6816708,1,0,snitko,,,"Mongols were a proto-state. The fact they didn&#x27;t have a permanent territory means nothing. They had an hierarchical structure. The only thing that was different was that other &quot;states&quot; realized it would actually be much profitable and safer to sit in one place and tax the shit out of their own people (and possibly those they conquered) instead of running around the globe and robbing everyone indefinitely.<p>I think the mistake you are making is thinking that it&#x27;s either a modern state which gives you certain benefits or some sort of medieval anarchy situation with warlords and lots of random violence. How about when you have 3 or 4 major protection agencies. You may think of them as governments, but instead they work within one country and everyone is free to switch to one or the other at any time. Those agencies sell laws to their customers want, resolve conflicts and enforce property rights. Why do you think such a competition would be worse than having a monopolist who doesn&#x27;t even live by its own laws (Example: senator did cocaine? made a mistake. A regular person did cocaine: jail). Try to understand that the word Anarchy doesn&#x27;t mean what you&#x27;ve been told it means.

If it was truly popular and highly priced relative to everyday purchases, we&#x27;d just invent names for fractions thereof, and use those for pricing, as we do in reverse for currencies like dollars or pounds. They already have satoshis etc.<p>Far more important limitations:<p>Built in deflation - that it is seen as a one-way bet with ever-increasing value and an ever more limited supply would cause problems if used as a currency (though not obviously as a store of value). The problem for it as a store of value is that the value is entirely predicated on it being <i>a successful currency</i>.<p>Volatility - if prices change rapidly, that would make use in retail almost impossible, and as a store of value dangerous. Many of the places which say they take Bitcoin right now simply move the money immediately to another currency to avoid this issue - that&#x27;s not going to work if it is actually used as a currency and to store value long-term. Imagine it replacing the USD for example and remaining volatile...<p>Time to process transactions - takings minutes to verify a transaction is not going to work -it&#x27;d need to be on the order of seconds, and for a digital currency it really should be as fast as the network.<p>Lack of regulation - again retailers/consumers should be nervous if their financial institutions have no regulations or guarantees that the money they say they hold actually exists at all. Some exchanges have reported a massive theft and walked away with no liability, others impose arbitrary limits on withdrawals etc - this really is wild-west finance and in a crash or bubble you can expect extreme fraud to go on undetected because there are no independent auditors, regulations or laws which govern these activities.<p>Lack of ties to identity - without verified accounts it&#x27;s far too easy to commit fraud or theft - very like paper money which everyone is moving away from.<p>Lack of reversibility - it doesn&#x27;t let you roll back transactions, though one could work around this by keeping a ledger and rolling the ledger positions back by transferring coins back and forth. If you&#x27;re going to do that though and trust the bank/exchange to regulate transactions, why bother with the cryptocurrency bit at all?<p>Lack of transparency in the management process - who decides on the rules of the game here? If the official clients suddenly change rules in concert - existing bitcoin holders would have to just go along with this if the majority voted with it - when large amounts of money are involved, this sort of thing becomes very important. e.g. we hit the existing 21m limit, and those controlling the software decide to up the limit to 30m - suddenly lots of assumptions about value would be questioned. I&#x27;d be very nervous about the lack of regulated control.<p>Lack of backing by a government, corporation or trading bloc - when the market attacks government currencies, governments are able to expend extreme resources to mitigate outright panic and collapse. When the market sharks get interested in Bitcoin and attack it in the same way as they attack say the Euro, there will be no such backup, just a freely floating rate which is open to manipulation and depends entirely on public confidence.<p>I do think it has some interesting properties and is a useful experiment, but have extreme reservations about this being the actual digital currency which makes it into use as a global exchange mechanism.",1385713908

As someone with a good high school education and promising background many people did not understand my choice. To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t too clear on it myself at the time. But like you I was looking for...something else.<p>The Army was not at all what I expected. I expected to be told what to do all the time or for it to be like something out of Full Metal Jacket. I expected extremes. It IS different and it can occasionally be extreme, but most days it just felt kind of like a boring job that you can&#x27;t quit and I&#x27;d guess that&#x27;s the usual experience (again, I&#x27;m talking peacetime here), no matter which branch or type of soldier you are (I was Infantry). I was a good soldier, but I spent most of the time looking forward to getting out. As far as helping others...I never felt like I had the opportunity.<p>However, I have never bonded so closely with a group of people before or since. And it definitely changed me for the better. I came out of it with a focus and drive that most of my peers severely lacked. Life just seemed a bit easier somehow. It also earns me respect wherever I go (deserved or not). Not to mention I was in hella good shape ;)<p>There&#x27;s also a bunch of financial benefits: VA medical care for life, low interest home loans, access to better credit unions (USAA) and money for college + bonuses.

Maybe it helps you: <a href=\"https://www.bionicspirit.com/blog/2013/05/13/getting-started-with-scala.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.bionicspirit.com/blog/2013/05/13/getting-started...</a><p>As a word of warning, don&#x27;t use Scalaz while in the learning process. It&#x27;s a pretty cool library, but I&#x27;ve been developing with Scala for the past 2 years already and personally I&#x27;ve never felt the need for Scalaz.<p>Akka is great, the standard library is great, Play is great. You can also use any Java library you want and wrapping Java libraries in Scala-ish interfaces is great for learning ;-)<p>> <i>Scala requires much more work to learn than Go.</i><p>This is true. Go is more familiar because it has a less complicated (and unfinished) type system and because it doesn&#x27;t contain too many unfamiliar concepts to developers that are used to mainstream languages.<p>For example in Scala you end up seeing a lot of flatMaps() being used on monads, you also see type-classes or persistent/immutable data-structures, or the CanBuildFrom pattern which looks intimidating at first, but it&#x27;s actually rather nice. Scala&#x27;s type system is also much more static and more expressive than that of Java, Go or C# and I&#x27;m specifically talking about generics. Scala makes it easier to write statically type-safe generic code, so of course, people end up wanting <i>more</i> and some of them go crazy with that.<p>Being a static functional programming language, the type system is intimidating at first, but as you learn about it, you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s elegant and much thought went into designing it. And most importantly, it <i>helps you</i> to write better code, instead of just staying in your way.<p>Scala also contains simplifications versus other mainstream languages. In comparison with C# or Java, in Scala there is no such thing as static methods or members. In fact, in Scala all member accesses are considered method calls. This has great implications for polymorphism. In comparison with other languages that mixed OOP and FP (e.g. F#, Ocaml), in Scala all types are modelled by means of classes or traits. While using other languages, you&#x27;ll notice that OOP (sub-typing) is a pain in combination with generics because covariance/contravariance is a bitch to deal with. Java&#x27;s generics are broken, because at the class level they simply don&#x27;t deal with it (they preferred invariance) and then for the methods themselves you&#x27;ve got to use wildcards. Scala is much saner in that regard. It also has a unified access philosophy that really simplifies things and the marriage that it achieves between OOP and FP is really good. In my opinion, only Clojure&#x27;s protocols are on the same level while being somewhat simpler, but that goes with the territory of a dynamic language.<p>Anyway, Scala&#x27;s learning curve may seem intimidating, but (1) it&#x27;s worth it because you learn a lot about FP with Scala (the ML style, not the LISP style, which is slightly different :)) and (2) you don&#x27;t need to use advanced concepts to write working code.<p>Have fun,",1385712379

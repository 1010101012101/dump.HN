6677241,comment,6675989,6677043,1,0,jaekwon,,,"We assume that the server is compromised, so the extension wouldn&#x27;t interpret just any JS from the server, whether or not it was delivered by HTTPS. Our idea is to require a committee to review and sign the code, and the extension would only execute code signed by the committee in consensus. This is just as secure as shipping all of the program logic in the extension, except in the case where all the signing committee member keys get compromised, which is unlikely.<p>My point in the previous comment was that dragnet surveillance wouldn&#x27;t work at all unless the client&#x27;s code was compromised, but there isn&#x27;t a good way for the NSA to compromise ALL OR MOST of the clients&#x27; code without it being detected by those users who use the extension. Remember the TorMail episode where malicious javascript was injected in the response? If some users had a Firefox extension that checked to make sure that all the JS code was signed by a committee, then they would have raised the flag and alerted everyone not to use TorMail.",1383677959

6677071,comment,6671118,6673321,3,0,spion,,,"Going through that list, this is what I think github style open-source prototype publishing would mean for the points made there:<p>Left side of the board:<p>- No need to ship anything. Its possible to just put whatever you have out there and let people play with it by forking it. It doesn&#x27;t even have to &quot;build&quot;, e.g. other  people could start by making it build reliably. There really are no limits.<p>- All code is immediately applicable for builders, even prototype code. Immediately applicable means that they&#x27;ll be able to read it, study it, toy with it (possibly <i>interactively</i>), see how it works, make some changes => get inspired<p>- github is not results-driven. No pressure to &quot;ship it&quot;, on the contrary - if you want to ship something, the common path is to fork and get it there by yourself, right?<p>- build and exit - the exit part doesn&#x27;t even apply.<p>Right side of the board:<p>- Source code does export knowledge to be built upon - and its even more knowledge than just old-fashioned media (videos and articles) - it exports hands-on, interactive, reshapeable, remixable, engaging knowledge.<p>- its perhaps not long-term enough, but on the plus side it <i>actively</i> engages a much larger number of people.<p>- it could indeed distract from deeper, foundational work but I think there is enough room for anyone to choose what kind of work they want to do - no need to centralize it all. For example, people could &quot;pull&quot; new foundational work from Victor into their own projects.<p>- its definitely exploratory - massively exploratory as it engages more people actively on many levels and causes an innovation ripple effect.<p>A tiny example: as soon as V8 implemented generators in JavaScript, the node.js community started experimenting with async runners. Lots of async runners were produced and ideas are still studied, analyzed and exchanged between various projects. But before V8 published it, it was all just excitement and discussion about the possibilities with zero hands-on experimentation and a much smaller number of ideas.<p>- it is indeed ongoing - nothing needs to be shipped, no project need necessarily be <i>done</i>.<p>Additionally:<p>- it represents extreme transparency - everything open to the public - which nicely matches the scientific method.<p>Percieved but non-existant downside:<p>- personal recognition is harder - not quite true. Its easy to think that some things may get lost in the mass of people, but usually the contrary happens - the pioneers always get the recognition. [citation needed - this one is based on personal observations]<p>Possible downsides:<p>- academic recognition: no idea how academy (and related publishers) treat open-source in general. It seems like they would be a perfect match for each other as they share a lot of common principles, but so far it hasn&#x27;t engaged researchers more massively...<p>Its a third category - different from traditional research and different from industry.

I love C (even more so after recently learning and using C++), but one minor thing is that frustrating is how hard it is to both (1) get really good at C and (2) the lack of great books on high-level C.<p>In other languages I use, I can get better by studying the source of programmers better than me. With C this is risky, as many large projects have messy code bases, and through their complexity hide the fact that one of C&#x27;s great features is that it can be extremely lightweight in some projects. The tricks skilled C programmers use are a mix on unadvised hacks (like xor swap) and truly clever, portable, advised concepts.<p>There&#x27;s also no great C book on higher-level C. Deep C Secrets is good, but perhaps a bit old. If you&#x27;re using C for data work, you&#x27;re out of luck (with maybe the exception of Ben Klemen&#x27;s book, Modelling with Data, which is good but almost uses C too much when a bit of R and python would help).

6676957,comment,6674571,6676497,6,0,benched,,,"I won&#x27;t call it luck, but there were certainly <i>circumstances</i> that enabled Minecraft. For example, Notch being born at the right stage of personal computers; the development of Infiniminer. But all successes will have such circumstances, because all events happen within a historical stream.<p>I see the particular success of Minecraft coming from multiple overlapping individual components or features that are each works of genius. The piling up of so many feats of genius in one place produces runaway success.<p>One of these features was borrowed from Infiniminer - the idea of the persistent, destructible/constructible world, modeled as a regular 3D grid to make it tractable, relatively simple to code, and easy to understand and manipulate. An innovation here is treating parts of the world like cellular automata at times (water, fire, etc). The next bit of genius is the crafting system. One might say other games had already done crafting, but I&#x27;d say none like Minecraft. Minecraft captured an earthy, complete-feeling microcosm of the whole supply chain. It captures something deeply geological, anthropological, and primal. This is the part of the game that, once I had figured out the very basics of wood and stone, my jaw fell on the floor, because I then intuited where Notch was going with it. How comprehensive and primal it was. I&#x27;d played plenty of games with &#x27;crafting&#x27; before, and this was something very different. More natural, more tiered, more &#x27;realistic&#x27; even though still a simplified model compared to the real world.<p>Next, the very effective use of lighting as a mechanic. The terror of being exposed on the surface, and the claustrophobia in tight underground packages. The breadcrumb trail mechanic of torches. Other games have used light before, but I struggle to think of one that used it quite like this.<p>Finally, Minecraft has the type of polish that comes from intentional simplicity, so that you don&#x27;t even notice it. Part of this is very, very good controls. Another is perfect collision detection, made possible by the simple 3D grid structure. Even though this kind of thing is notable for what you don&#x27;t notice, it comes from Notch being a good game programmer with a good grasp of 3D programming. Not just anyone could have realized these ideas in such a polished way, even if they had the ideas.<p>Sure, everyone is a product of their environment, the time they live in, their influences and so forth. You can say that about anyone. But with Minecraft, Notch did a perfect storm of right things, and it resonated with millions of people.",1383676078

Because our jobs are periodic we run both Core and Task as spots and simply retry the job if our machines get terminated. I did a lot of benchmarking and found that a small number of cc2.8xlarge machines out-performs and is cheaper than a large number of lesser instances (and I tried most of the lesser machines). In us-west-2 it&#x27;s very uncommon to lose our instances, unlike us-east-1 which has major price fluctuations (this is true for all types of spot instance).<p>- The cr1.8xlarge has fantastic performance, relative to the rest of the AWS machines. It&#x27;s also very expensive compared to the cost of hardware or a similar solution on another cloud provider. Since we&#x27;re fully integrated with AWS and don&#x27;t want to run our own hardware we&#x27;re sucking up the cost for now, but it&#x27;s definitely a sore-point in our budget.

When these users wonder if they&#x27;ve done enough with their photo collection, they just have to look through FB and remember that yes, they did put up a few photos and people liked and commented them, end of further discussion.<p>Of course, these users may have thousands of other photos that they just never got to...but that might not matter for most people...they&#x27;ve already gotten some satisfaction from sharing.<p>Of course there are shutterbugs who do feel a yearning to go through their photos and see them all again...but are there enough to support a paid service? Hard to say, especially with the many other photo services out there.<p>From my perspective, I have a pro Flickr account where I have nearly 10,000 photos...which represents less than 5 percent of the photos I&#x27;ve taken in the last few years. However, a service like Everpix is not appealing enough to me...because the barrier to me is not that I can&#x27;t easily access old photos, but that I&#x27;ve realized that editing and sorting photos is the long part of the work...and unless Everpix mitigates that part better than Lightroom and a bunch of external HDs, I don&#x27;t think id be compelled to try it out.<p>And so for now, Flickr is good enough...I mostly use Flickr because it&#x27;s an easy way for people to find me. I imagine 500px likewise finds its success less as a storage service and more of a place to shareable nod be seen. A lot of the testimonials I&#x27;ve seen of Everpix was its value to people and their own photos...which, while is a very valuable thing to serve, it is ultimately the sharing of these photos that makes people want to join a service in the first place",1383675696

But we need more efforts like this (see for example the excellent Lout by Jeffrey H. Kingston).<p>First, let me make it clear that I&#x27;m a big big fan of Knuth and Lamport and I respect the amazing impact that TeX/LaTeX have had in the Math/Science/Engineering communities. They are clearly a lot smarter than I am, and I owe them a debt for their contributions to CS.  I&#x27;ve read  Knuth&#x27;s original papers on Alpha-Beta search, LR-parsing, etc., I own almost all of his books, and I&#x27;ve studied the Art of Computer Programming in depth since the first editions.<p>TeX is an amazing feat of programming.  I had a friend that was in the same fraternity as Knuth as a student.  This friend was a great programmer and even he was in awe of Knuth&#x27;s abilities as a programmer.  Look at the history of TeX, the decisions and approaches that Knuth considered and undertook.  It&#x27;s absolutely amazing, and then he essentially gave it away, one of the first and most important Open Source projects!<p>But, please, can&#x27;t we come up with a new replacement for LaTeX?  By now, it should be obvious that there are only about 7 people in the world that really understand LaTeX/TeX (and I&#x27;m not one of them).  Hang out on <a href=""http://tex.stackexchange.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tex.stackexchange.com</a> and see what I mean.  I&#x27;ve used LaTeX for almost 30 years; it&#x27;s the first tool I reach for when preparing a document.  Thirty years of it is enough.<p>Now, I write my own styles (.sty files) and complex macros, but the experience isn&#x27;t pleasant.  I think it&#x27;s here that something needs to be done.  I&#x27;ve never been able to convince more than ten percent of the software engineers that have worked for me to use LaTeX.  It&#x27;s not that they don&#x27;t like markup or programming.  It&#x27;s the mess caused by TeX&#x27;s macro based extension language.  This leads to less than helpful error messages, cryptic behavior, and is a barrier to anyone wishing to take advantage of the underlying power of TeX.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone will try to argue that the TeX macro system is so elegant and powerful or that I simply haven&#x27;t spent enough time with it, but let me say this, I&#x27;ve programmed for 45 years and I&#x27;ve used macros plenty.  I&#x27;ve written packages of macros running on IBM (big machine) assemblers, did assembly language real-time programming for years, implemented macro programming systems like Calvin Mooers Reactive Typewriter [1] and concatenative programming languages like FORTH.  Nothing, to me, is more frustrating than trying to write a sophisticated LaTeX package.  I&#x27;ve patched boot loaders from the front panel switches of mainframes that wouldn&#x27;t boot, debugged real time programs containing thousands of lines of assembler, used C++ templates and Haskell types.  All of this is easier than writing a fancy new TeX macro.  I don&#x27;t like writing as much as programming, why do the tools have to make it even harder?<p>Fundamentally, I think that using macros is the wrong way to write extensions and customizations in LaTeX/TeX, the abstractions used to construct anything complex leak too many implementation details.  For some of my projects I&#x27;ve found it easier to write custom filters in Python that preprocess input files into plain LaTeX.  This observation isn&#x27;t unique to Latex [2].<p>LaTeX3 and LuaTeX kept me interested in TeX; I hoped that they would make programming TeX packages and customization easier.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have enough time left to wait for them; they move at a glacial pace and are essentially indistinguishable from abandon-ware.  As those 7 guys that understand TeX move on to get real jobs, these projects falter and don&#x27;t go anywhere.  The LuaTeX web-site has been stuck on version 0.6 for thirty months.<p>Please, can&#x27;t the community come up with something?  Or point me towards a project with a license that I could contribute to.<p>[1] TRAC (the reactive typewriter system) is a macro based programming system, described in Computer Lib/Dream Machines a 1974 book by Ted Nelson and by its inventor Mooers in the CACM, Volume 9 Issue 3, March 1966 Pages 215-219.<p>[2] <a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2007/12/17/macros-why-theyre-evil/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2007/12/17/macros-why-theyr...</a>",1383675635

Depending on the company they may be reluctant to give you anything big to work on as you will be gone soon.<p>U of T has PEY, professional experience year, 12-16 months of internship.  I really enjoyed my year off, made what I learnt at school make sense. When I came back to school after a year I was much more committed.  The downfall is that for a few summers you maybe doing odd jobs to get by.<p>In terms of education, I think it really depends on the student.

6676711,comment,6676369,6676615,4,0,lstamour,,,"Generally speaking, when offline apps went online, they would &quot;sync&quot;. This process is not straightforward, quick nor modern. Web apps don&#x27;t &quot;sync&quot;, they just &quot;work&quot;. How can you design a native app that behaves like a web app? That&#x27;s a less explored question. I&#x27;m not saying it hasn&#x27;t been looked at yet, of course, and phones are some of the first to do it. Microsoft could take the lead here, with their approach of &quot;only showing icons for connectivity when the connectivity changes&quot; and of hiding buttons when they aren&#x27;t going to work, so you can presume that anything you see on screen is going to work even when offline. Windows Phone and Windows 8 guidelines have a few more examples like this. On the other side of the fence, Apple has done similarly with their apps. iTunes Radio will continue caching the next song and part of the song after it, so even when I go down to the subway and lose signal, I still get to hear another 5 min of music. That said, the rewind and replay features of TuneIn were still superior and it&#x27;d be nicer still if iTunes radio transitioned into playing back either cached tracks or my own library instead of stopping dead. (Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if while listening, between tracks or when it stops, Siri stepped in and announced why the track can&#x27;t play and suggests alternatives?)<p>Part of this new medium is to come up with techniques of explaining that apps work offline -- people&#x27;s expectations, still, are that if they visit a website, they need to be online. That alone is a huge hurdle.<p>In addition, some of the best services, e.g. browser-based push notifications from Apple (rather than those of native Chrome) will not work without Internet since they use the same push protocols as native push notifications on iOS (iirc). That said, even on iOS, I think apps can now add notifications without internet, so that should be changing, just as apps can sign up to do background pre-caching of data.<p>There are some HTML-only problems too: How do you version web requests from remote hosts? How about third-party JS? There are so many considerations in offline scenarios that most web developers never need consider. I really hope offline first takes off as the next &quot;mobile first&quot; or &quot;responsive design&quot;. If nothing else, it will make for more robust online-only apps.",1383674551

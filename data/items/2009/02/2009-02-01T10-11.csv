460779,comment,460542,460542,0,0,CalmQuiet,,,"This raises so many doubts.
As with numerous other comments to the original SF Chronicle article, I am outraged at the idea that <i>one more WIFI</i> service area thinks I should be subscribing for $30/ month or so.  Right :/
Furthermore:  who decided to sign a 10-year contract? The supervising Board for BART must have been blinded by its drool over a cash cow to help fund its operations. Did it not occur to them that it's likely rates will be coming down because of increased competition & new technologies within even <i>5</i> years?  
Of course 16,000 signed up <i>for free</i>.  Let's form a pool to bet how long it'll take to get that number of <i>paid</i> subscribers.",1233485346

One part of it is because of the wasted time in getting to the office and back.  Another bigger part is because programmers work in an open space plan. Some other parts would be office politics and so on...<p>Working in a home office was so much better than i often ended up working 16 hours a day prior to a project deadline and not mind(i used to enjoy what i do).<p>We used to communicate all the time via IM, via email, and via skype. And of course make full use of collaboration tools. Also, me being in a different time zone helped the process a lot.<p>So yeah, some people will take advantage of this situation.

460772,comment,460383,460383,0,0,mkn,,,"To me, that article was an amazing technical achievement. The author went on for three pages about police seeking the right to jam cell phone signals, and not once did they mention the ramifications for the ability of the populace to hold the police to account for abuses. And they did so less than two weeks after damning cell phone video of the execution of a civilian by a police officer on the BART system.<p>While I would admire the author's technical skill in skirting the issue (truly amazing), I now have even deeper reservations about the editorial policy and institutional bias of the Washington Post. While many of the participants at HN write very lucidly, I wouldn't guess that many of us have worked as writers. I have, and I could not have <i>designed</i> a piece of writing to better omit the issue of civilian surveillance of law enforcement officers given the subject matter they were handling.",1233484487

That greatly reduces the conditioning effect, not to mention karma-related drama and groupthink (as Surowiecki argues, crowd wisdom is best procured when evaluations are performed independently). Submissions and comments can still be ordered by net karma over time, as they are now.<p>Whatever you choose to do, I think there's a strong argument in favor of experimentalism.

460760,comment,460631,460634,0,0,lunchbox,,,"><i>I really can't think of any reason why you'd want to show score before voting.</i><p>It really depends on whether you see yourself as a Hacker News reader, or as a Hacker News editor. It's just like Amazon: If I'm a customer, I want to hear what everyone else thinks about something. But if I were hiring someone to be a professional reviewer for Amazon, I'd hide the other ratings to make them as objective as possible.<p>So here are two ways ratings make HN a more pleasant experience:<p>- If I have limited time to go through HN, I want to be able to zoom in on the comments others judged to be of the highest quality.<p>- If the comment is on a topic I have little familiarity with, it's often hard to judge its accuracy/validity on my own. A decent number of votes gives me confidence that the person is right.<p>So in these respects, it's just like Google rankings or Amazon ratings.<p>Having points probably does cause some amount of groupthink. I bet hiding votes would scrunch the distribution of votes around the mean.<p>By the way, if HN's database contains the exact sequence of upmods/downmods for a particular story, e.g. 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, 1, ..., it would be possible to test how much groupthink is involved by modeling the sequence of votes as a random walk and testing how much the probability of an upmod/downmod is conditional on the current number of votes. Or, if HN starts hiding votes, you could analyze how this affects voting patterns. Sounds like an interesting college stats/psychology project for someone :)",1233483543
460759,comment,460624,460624,0,0,jsomers,,,"I recall PG saying something a while back about a ""rollback"" feature that would give you the option to only display those comments and submissions created by users above a certain account-age/karma threshold. So in effect you could turn a knob and the site would roll back to, say, the user base from 300 days ago.<p>I thought it sounded like a pretty elegant (if potentially divisive) solution, maybe worth serious consideration.",1233483328

That time is lost to you unless you have some way to make use of it -- and the Internet for time-shifting either productive labor or errands makes a whole lot of sense.<p>I have roughly 4 hours of daily commute (yay, Japan) and would give my spleen to have sustained connectivity (and room to open a laptop).

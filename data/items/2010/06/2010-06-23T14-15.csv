(Don't ever use the word link.  You'll regret it.  ""Button that says..."", ""picture that says..."", ""underlined blue text that says..."") Tell them to click the<p>+ purple button<p>+ which says Sign In<p>+ near the top-right corner of their screen.<p>You will be <i>amazed</i> how much more effective that makes them at carrying out directions.  (If you can only pick one, go for color or similar visual distinctiveness.  Your users have long-since stopped reading everything on their computer because ""none of it makes sense anyhow."")<p>In my experience it is worth overruling your designer's desire for visual continuity and having your most important button(s) be uniquely identifiable by color.  (Strictly speaking I use purple for two things, but if they try to sign in by signing up for the free trial they'll be signed in like they intended.)",1277305024

...Each generation learns things and most of it is not passed on to the next generation. Every single one of my peers got squat from their parents in terms of ""this is how it works, pay attention"".<p>Blade Runner is an excellent choice for this discussion. 
A really good movie, something that remains with you long after. In terms of scary violence - that early tense scene where the android is being tested might be over the top - but the rest is just Star-Warsy gun battles where no one gets their head blown off...<p>Is it really that much more violent than prime time TV?<p>Lots of murky,scary suspenseful scenes.<p>I guess the counter argument is always - 'there will be time to watch this in the future'. But it is an individual decision not one for the esrb. Depends on the kid, I think.<p>On overprotection. I ran across a reference within the last year to 'free-range parenting'. Didnt read the book but got a good chuckle out of the amazon review and the idea in general.<p>I live in a NJ city about 1 mile west of the Empire State Bldg. So I am in the crucible of NYC-metro competitiveness which insinuates itself into everyday life. Kids taking 2 or 3 different language classes, multiple sports, music  - all before they are 4 yrs old.<p>And insane over-protectiveness at times. A neighbor with 2 boys 9 and 7 yrs old, lets them walk 6 blocks to school. Which I somewhat agree with. Not sure I will be able to do that at the time but it has made me think about this issue in general.<p>The biggest problem with over-protectiveness in general is that I think kids absorb the fact that you dont trust them.
In fact you are thinking of  the murderers and molesters and drunk drivers but the kid thinks you dont trust him/her.<p>The movie/ novel ""The Road"" deals with this on an extreme level<p>I think this will inevitably happen in adolescence - some kind of ""I'm old enough"" / ""No you're not"" discussion.

Your service will typically contain more than just one set of resources, so you'd end up either creating a separate search resource for each set or passing set identifiers of some sort as a query parameter to the search resource.<p>The typical model is to have 'container' resources. For example, if /articles/9001 is a resource, /articles is the container. You can POST to the container to create a new resource, and you can GET the container to find out some information about it, such as the number of resources it contains and a list of them. For this part of the design I'll typically return a list of links to the first N resources in the container and a navigation link to the next N resources. That navigation link uses the same URL for the container resource, but with a query parameter that tells it which resource to start on. I'll typically also implement search/filter query parameters to allow further control over the list of resources to include in the container's representation.",1277304156

The drawback is that your clients lose the ability to use standard HTTP libraries to talk to your service because you're using a non-standard set of methods. The 'Uniform' in URI and URL doesn't just apply to the resource identifiers; in a RESTful system the methods and representations both need to be uniform as well. That allows general-purpose clients to be able to interact with the service, and that was what made the web take off when earlier FTP and Gopher systems did not.",1277303647

The reality is that Accenture needs to quickly bring together large teams of people who have not previously worked together, and make them productive as quickly as possible.  One way to facilitate that is to ensure that they have a common language and understanding of how projects are run.<p>I don't know if they still do it, but throughout my tenure at Accenture new hires were sent for an initial training course at the firm's St. Charles campus.  The course was traditionally 3 weeks long, and in addition to teaching basic programming to those who had no prior experience (many Accenture hires are not CS or engineering students), it gave new staff some experience with how Accenture runs projects. After the course, new ""analysts"" are assigned to their first project.  The first couple of years as an analyst tend to be ""in the trenches"" type work, as people don't really have much industry experience.  After a couple of years as an analyst you become a ""consultant"", and start to get more authority and responsibility.  It typically takes about 5 years to make it to ""manager"", at which point you start to get real authority within project teams.  From there, career path's vary.

1) Copyright exists to encourage the creation of new works - ie to benefit the public, not the creators per se.
2) Copyright is a two-edged sword. Maybe knowing that you can copyright a song encourages your creativity. But knowing that they can't reuse your song discourages someone else's. (And reuse of others' work is old - classical composers borrowed others' music or poetry frequently.)
3) Consumers should recognize that NEVER buying movies, music, etc, but ALWAYS pirating them, will mean that some media, like music, is much harder to make, and other media, like big-budget films, are impossible. So it's in fans' interest to buy at least sometimes.
4) On the other hand, media producers have not convincingly shown (to my knowledge) that piracy is really hurting them. Clearly not every download is a lost sale: demand at price 0 will always be greater than at price $15, and piracy may expose people to band which they later buy from (this has happened to me). A decline in music revenues may be partly linked to a rise in video games and other entertainment.",1277302921

In the weeks before Netscape Navigator shipped in the mid-90s, Jamie Zawinski slept under his desk at work trying to make it reliable. The builds from the night before launch crashed! Nobody thought they&#x27;d make it. That&#x27;s a story anyone on a commercial dev team can probably tell you; it&#x27;s the oldest story in product development.<p>That kind of incremental development works fine when you&#x27;re shipping the first web browser, or even the first version of a new web browser.<p>It does not work when you are shipping cryptography. Nate Lawson is fond of saying, &quot;plan to budget 10x for the validation of a new cryptosystem as you to implementation&quot;.

5990378,comment,5988204,5989216,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>crazy pants MoC land here</i><p>That was uncalled-for.<p><i>None of the startups I worked at panned out, all but the last has folded (try getting references when every company you&#x27;ve worked at no longer exists), and all the equity I ever vested is worth less than the papers I had to sign to get it.</i><p>I just turned 30 as well, so I&#x27;m the same age as you are.<p>This is fairly typical, and you shouldn&#x27;t feel bad about it. Most of the information that you need to evaluate a startup job is not available to an engineer in his 20s.<p>I&#x27;ve concluded that you don&#x27;t do startup jobs for employee equity. You do them for high positions (as the firm matures) and introductions. This means you have to ask yourself: will the CEO be making introductions on my behalf, so I could do my own startup if I wanted, in 24-36 months? If yes, continue on. If no, don&#x27;t.<p>The worst thing that happens isn&#x27;t joining a startup and getting low equity, because that&#x27;s typical and not really insulting or a reflection on you-- it&#x27;s just business. Market conditions are such that you don&#x27;t really have position to ask for more equity. Much worse is joining a startup and having it grow above you. It&#x27;s not only humiliating, but it means you&#x27;ve irreversibly fallen into the &quot;not a real player&quot; bucket and should leave because it&#x27;s only going to get worse.<p>However, the job volatility of the startup market does make you a less attractive candidate in the future, and people don&#x27;t talk about it much, but the &quot;job hopper&quot; stigma is still alive outside of VC-funded startups.<p><i>I sit around and listen to people say your 20s are for building up a massive hoard of cash and investments so you can live the rest of your life. Ouch. Failureland.</i><p>If it makes you feel better, I bet that less than 5% of people our age have more than $25,000 in net worth. Our generation has been screwed but, to our benefit, demography favors us being politically powerful in the 2020s to &#x27;40s. We&#x27;ll be broke in the near future, but the political torch is passing to us.<p>Being a large/dominant generation (which we are, like the Boomers) is bad when you&#x27;re young because of wage depression and competition-- this is part of why the Boomers rebelled in the 1960s; compared to what their parents faced, the workplace was getting much more competitive-- but it starts to favor a generation in middle age because they become the political core.<p><i>Move fast and ruin your life.</i><p>Well said. The real crime of this system isn&#x27;t that startups don&#x27;t pay well and that equity slices are small. The deep injustice is in the long-term career effects that no one talks about. If you have 5 no-name startups on your resume, that hedge fund job is a lot harder to get. Ten years ago, finance was pretty hot for technical talent of any kind; but, in 2013, the typical job-hopping of our world gets you creamed on &quot;cultural fit&quot;. Hedge funds are a different world-- they pay better and I think their cultures are usually better than what most startups have-- but more conservative, more superficially conformist, and (because of the trade-secret risk) not likely to hire someone who seems to leave jobs quickly (even though, with most startups, you can tell if you&#x27;re wasting your time at 6 months). Startups know that the degenerate job hoppers out there (which are a small fraction of all job hoppers; most of us leave quickly not because of character flaws, but just because most jobs aren&#x27;t worth keeping) aren&#x27;t an existential danger, because amassing the connections and managing investors and building a brand is very hard; but hedge funds have a justified fear of people stealing their trading strategies and don&#x27;t want to hire people with quick feet.<p>If I wanted to go gray hat, my startup would be to generate a bunch of shell companies (staffed by people who offer references) with nice websites and offer career plastic surgery &quot;as a service&quot; for people with damaged resumes. One could even typo-squat established companies (&quot;tell me about your time at Gldman&quot;). The sad thing is, it&#x27;s probably the best startup idea I&#x27;ve ever had. I know there&#x27;s a market (startup peons with damaged careers) for it, making money would be ridiculously easy, and it would probably be good for society. Unfortunately, the reputation issues would be pretty severe; it&#x27;d be the last startup I ever did.<p><i>Work for sub-market wages with free lunches, work-on-whatever-you-want policies, and unlimited vacation days.</i><p>I&#x27;m a huge champion of open allocation (which is not as extreme as &quot;work on whatever you want&quot;; you&#x27;re still responsible for working on something of value to the firm) but any startup that has a &quot;work on whatever you want&quot; policy is either lying or destined for failure. Startups need focus, and they need <i>implicit</i> focus (low management overhead) which means there isn&#x27;t an open/closed allocation distinction yet because they work as one team.  Open allocation starts to be the right way to go around 15-50 people.<p><i>Perhaps we just need better transportation so I can commute to jobs in SF and NYC while living in Iowa.</i><p>This is what I&#x27;ve learned. If you work in New York or the Valley in your 20s, that <i>is</i> your savings. You lose everything to rent, which means that the reputation premium you get from working high-status jobs better be strong.<p>I think that, as our generation gets increasingly jaded and as a larger number of smart people return from NYC and SF empty-handed, society <i>will</i> absorb the signal and the next decade of technical talent will want to avoid the high-rent cities (which will remain expensive for other reasons). I could see Austin or Seattle or even Chicago (which, by rights, should have a strong tech scene) taking the lion&#x27;s share of the new action.",1372941947

5990273,comment,5990132,5990182,7,0,PommeDeTerre,,,"GNOME 3 is a perfect, and very recent, example of what you&#x27;re describing.<p>It was open source programmers who made GNOME 2 and earlier a successful, usable desktop environment. These were very technical users who created software that generally worked well for their purposes, but incidentally also worked well for other, less-technical users, too.<p>Yet at some point, we saw the number of &quot;designers&quot; and &quot;UI experts&quot; start to grow, and eventually overwhelm the number of programmers. The &quot;make it usable by everyone&quot; mantra took over, but without the skill and sensibility we saw from programmers alone.<p>The end result has been GNOME 3. At best, it can be considered one of the worst open source disasters of all time. Its designer-driven development process and subsequent lack of usability and quality has alienated many programmers. These are exactly the kind of people who shouldn&#x27;t be alienated, because they did things right in the first place. Aside from a few odd cases here and there, GNOME 3 is generally hated by anyone who uses his or her computer to do real work.<p>And what you say about seeking alternatives, or even creating them, is very true. KDE and Xfce benefited immensely from the GNOME 3 debacle, accepting many of the talented and valuable GNOME &quot;refugees&quot;. MATE and Cinnamon have been born to try to fix the problem, as well.<p>GNOME 3 isn&#x27;t the only example. Firefox is another good example, and obviously quite relevant to Opera. It has been systematically dumbed-down basically every release starting with Firefox 4, which has rendered it far less useful than it once was, causing many advanced users to abandon it.<p>Opera does indeed appear to be following this same path, unfortunately. Opera 15 has the same feeling that GNOME 3 does, in that it is a regression from the previous versions. Discarding so many things that make Opera 12 and earlier such a great browser just isn&#x27;t a good way forward.",1372940133

In addition to GCHQ and this crap from France, Netzpolitik.org recently dug up some interesting info on the publically known activities of the German secret services, which include tapping sea cables[1] and listening in on 5% of DECIX traffic[2].<p>So we now know for a fact that, while the general populace was blissfully disinterested and the techie crowd was mostly playing with its new toys, the intelligence community started building an all-encompassing global surveillance infrastructure. If we don&#x27;t manage to pull off a roll-back now, our children or grandchildren will live in an actual science fiction dystopia.<p>My feeling is that we have a very small chance to achieve a roll-back in (continental) Europe, because the uncovered actions of secret services here are much more at odds with the societal consensus on the accepted powers of the executive.

The technical means have been there for years and years.</i><p>Have you thought through the implications of this? To me capturing and storing all the information we generate is really dangerous, and there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d want a log of everything in my life to be accessible to my secret service, my government, police, <i>and</i> the secret services of anyone they might wish to share it with (in particular the NSA) in secret and without my permission.<p>You&#x27;ve carefully avoided stating an opinion on these actions of our security services, but presented it as a fait accompli that we may as well just live with. I disagree. They&#x27;ve lied to us about what they were collecting (everything) and lied to us about what it is for (terror). I see no reason to trust any assurances or controls which are introduced on access, and the only way to stop abuse is to stop collection.<p>It appears they&#x27;re not yet at the point where they can store all information indefinitely, but that point will arrive soon, and I think we should stop them before it does. I don&#x27;t even trust the current politicians and police with this information on every citizen, let alone any conceivable politician who might come to power in the next few centuries.<p>IMHO we should have strong protections banning outright the collection and collation of this sort of material except where there are reasons to be believe someone is a serious criminal (violence, fraud, terror), with judicial oversight, for a limited time, with the data deleted after the trial. Just as the police are not allowed to demand DNA samples from entire populations in order to solve a crime, security services should not be allowed to store our every move and thought in the name of <i>defending liberty</i>, it makes a mockery of the concepts they claim to be protecting, and is extremely dangerous in the long term.",1372939359

5990222,comment,5989707,5990043,17,0,DanBC,,,"> These &quot;serious cryptographers&quot; really never seem to deliver usable solutions<p>When people say a crypto product is &quot;broken&quot; they have several different meanings.<p>Ignoring one-time-pads every crypto system can be, in theory, broken by brute force.  The time taken to do the brute forcing might be billions of years, but in theory it&#x27;s possible.  This is the edge of what we currently know about math.<p>Anything that can be cracked quicker than brute forcing is regarded as broken, <i>even if that attack is still not feasible</i>.  A crypto-system that takes 100 billion billion years to brute force, but 10 billion billion years with some other attack is still regarded as broken.  At that point people would tend to stop working on that algorithm and move onto something else, or they&#x27;d try to improve that crack and see if it can be combined to make something feasible.  Don&#x27;t forget that the bad guys keep their secrets secret.  You will not know if they can break your product.<p>This can be frustrating for people developing software.  &quot;But wait, no-one can actually use that flaw to break the crypto, so it&#x27;s still secure, right?&quot;  Well, not really.<p>And then that algorithm, the math, has to be turned into code.  This is hard because you need to know what the language is doing, what the compiler is doing, what the hardware is doing.  Any flaws in the algorithm could be magnified by implementation as software.<p>Just as an example of people keeping secrets: Diffie and Hellman invented a practical key exchange in 1976; it had been independently invented -and kept secret- in 1974 by Ellis, Cocks, and Williamson at GCHQ.  GCHQ made this public in 1997.  Even though key exchange was in use by very many people all over the world it was kept secret for about 25 years.<p>Clifford Cocks invented RSA a few years before Rivest Shamir and Adelman did.  (Not only did he do it before them, but because he wasn&#x27;t in the building he did it in his head.  (He wasn&#x27;t allowed to write anything down.)  He had to go to sleep and hope that he still remembered it in the morning.)  And, again, even though RSA was in use daily by very many people GCHQ still kept it secret until 1997, about 25 years.<p>> Cryptocat managed to bring cryptography to the masses<p>No, it really didn&#x27;t.  CryptoCat gave people a false sense of security.  CryptoCat gave people the illusion of secrecy.  Cryptocat didn&#x27;t give people a usable safe product.<p>> usually no &quot;serious cryptographers&quot; have managed with the same thing.<p>The cryptocat developers would do far more good by using their knowledge to make existing tested products easier to use.<p>You appear to be ignoring PGP / GPG; SSL, etc, which are used by many people.",1372939287

Libraries like NACL are good for this, you don&#x27;t specify cipher modes or anything like that you just say something closer to encrypt(data,key);<p>Of course you can still fuck up with just that, but it reduces the requirements for the programmer to understand deep cryptography and focus on designing their application for their users.<p>Also the advertised level of security will alter how the users use the software.<p>Say for example you have a bunch of confidential documents, you are currently storing them in a bomb proof safe and you never digitize them because you are concerned about security even though digital copies would be useful.<p>Along comes software that promises to be just as secure as your safe (or more secure). So you jump on it and start using it.

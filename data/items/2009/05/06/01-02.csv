You need a reputation before anyone will pick you.<p>My advice is as follows:\na) Spend about $500 to get some feedback. Don't get greedy and make all of those large projects. You need to start out with a few small ones, then get a few large ones. Your goal is to have 7-8 ""feedbacks"" about how great you are.<p>b) At the same time you should bid on other projects, doesn't matter if its big or small, if its a $20 project or a $30 project. Your goal in the early stage is to get a lot of feedback points.<p>c) Once you reach 20 or so feedbacks you'll be able to actually win some of those larger projects. At this point your skills will improve, and you can actually start charging more than the average offshore developer. You can explain the difference by saying you are in the USA and are actually in the same time zone as your clients.<p>Also if you have some free time, make 5-6 websites, that you can point to as your ""work"". They don't need to be super complicated, but they should look good.",1241575130

Getting those things in <i>real time</i> isn't very valuable in my opinion.<p>After all these years of spam filter development, I still get spam regularly. I don't think there's a way to deliver news from Twitter to people in real time with more accuracy than spam filters, and that would be annoying. Again, I don't think that many people use the breaking news text messaging services that already exist and are curated by human beings.<p>The Twitter messages and pictures when the plane landed in the Hudson River were awesome. I didn't care that I only saw them hours after the fact. I don't think anyone else cared either. It might have been nice to get them in real time, but not at the cost of noise. Noise is impossible to reduce to a manageable level when you're text messaging people because it interrupts whatever they're doing. You could send emails instead, but then you either are still interrupting people who check their email constantly, or you're losing the real time aspect.",1241574690

Do I really need to find out about something right when it happens as opposed to 5-10 minutes later? How can I even find out about things without wading through tons of crap? I doubt that the frequency of messages from a certain area would accurately surface events of note. Processing the text of the messages could help, but it still wouldn't be a service anyone would want. I bet there are surges of tweets for all sorts of random stuff that no one cares about, so if they're sending me a text whenever there's a surge, I'm going to end up turning it off pretty quick.<p>Editors are valuable. Gaining a five minute head start on news is next to worthless, and the signal to noise ratio will make it far worse than just signing up for breaking news text messages from an actual news source.

When I look at “good haskell” I see it dominated with comments written in procedural english describing what the code does e.g.<p><a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pretty-1.1.1.1/docs/src/Text-PrettyPrint-HughesPJ.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pretty-1.1.1.1/docs/src/T...</a><p>Haskell requires this because, lets be frank, its really hard to understand. I can hear the howls of anger but if you ask “man in the street”, will he do a better job explaining the above haskell sans comments or a similar pretty printer written in VB? I have CS background, studied FP and type theory, but I am more like the man in the street.<p>What I want from a programming language is an executable description of what I want to achieve. I want that description to have all the good qualities sought in fp but more importantly I want it to flow into and out of my brain (and my colleague’s brains) like butter not like a sudoku puzzle trapped in a type theory proof and then Huffman encoded (because descriptive names are the preserve of all those &quot;terrible java programmers&quot;).<p>In the real world, I need to write code that makes fast incremental changes to large interconnected data-structures e.g. graphs and trees with indexes and all sorts.

Multilane PCI-E neatly sidesteps such issues by using what essentially amounts to multiple independent serial links that are bonded together.

Hence the RW article on the basilisk. No email since then, so it seems to do the job.<p>Alright, first of all, don&#x27;t pretend that RW as a whole was trying to help LW by writing about it. A bunch of the RW writers clearly held contempt for LW, when they started writing about it, which is shown in inside discussions[1], as well as in the article about LW[2]. Additionally, even though the wording has been cleared a little (LW posters are no longer described as &#x27;butthurt&#x27; for example) over the years, the Wiki(s) still contain inaccurate information (although I&#x27;ll have to make a whole post to point it all out). I am mentioning this, because this is where the initial RW writings about the basilisk were.<p>Second of all, you published the Basilisk article in 2013 - 3 whole years after the incident, when many people had forgotten about it, and new users hadn&#x27;t even heard about it. Were you really trying to help, and not just make fun of LW (which seems to me to be the motivation of most people on that Talk page you linked)? You do realize, that it was after the RW article (with the help of the rest of XiXiDu&#x27;s posts on the topic from the same time) which brought the topic back, and massively increased the publicity of the basilisk? Indeed, I suspect (but have no proof) that [a lot] more than half the people who have heard of the basilisk, would&#x27;ve never done so if it wasn&#x27;t for your article (and  slate wouldn&#x27;t write about it).<p>At any rate, let&#x27;s accept that at least your motivation was only to help.How big is this &#x27;small sample of victims I know of&#x27;, that you were trying to help? How many emails did you and Dymtry receive from people who were actually distressed? And, less importantly - how many did you receive in 2013?<p>You sure are making it sound like a significant part of LW believes in the basilisk, both in various revisions of the articles on RW, and in comments on the topic. At any rate, is the number larger than the number of crackpots who comment on HN, or the crackpots who read RW, or is it something like 4 people who got over it quickly?<p>1. <a href=""http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Talk:LessWrong/Archive1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Talk:LessWrong/Archive1</a><p>2. <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20110719151907/http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/LessWrong"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20110719151907/http://rationalwik...</a>",1406281117

However, reporting misconduct can be personally and professionally risky. The aim of the research was to examine the professional consequences of whistleblowing and nonwhistleblowing in nursing. A descriptive survey design was used to examine the professional effect of reporting misconduct (whistleblowing) and not reporting misconduct (nonwhistleblowing). Ninety-five respondents were included in the study; 70 were self-identified as whistleblowers and 25 were self-identified as nonwhistleblowers. Results indicated that there were severe professional reprisals if the nurse reported misconduct, but there were few professional consequences if the nurse remained silent. Official reprisals included demotion (4%), reprimand (11%), and referral to a psychiatrist (9%). Whistleblowers also reported that they received professional reprisals in the form of threats (16%), rejection by peers (14%), pressure to resign (7%), and being treated as a traitor (14%). Ten per cent reported that they felt their career had been halted. These findings suggest that when nurses identify and report misconduct in the workplace, they may experience serious professional consequences.\n&quot;",1406279399

But if the wavelength is too large the cage can not pick up the EMF, and the EMF is present inside the cage. (However with a wave that large is not clear it would do anything to devices inside.

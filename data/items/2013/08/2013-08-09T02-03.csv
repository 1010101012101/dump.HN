Sony and its developers have lost out on hundreds of my dollars over the past few years.  I will completely stay away from Sony in the next console generation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otheros"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otheros</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5886509"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5886509</a>",1376017165

That gives people a strong incentive to avoid causing actual harm, i.e., to get better at assessing the risks of the things they do, including driving.<p>To the extent that we actually allow this incentive to operate in our society, I think it works reasonably well, certainly better than trusting governments to get things like this right. shpxnvz provided some evidence for that. Another piece of evidence is the fact that states with no-fault auto insurance have higher accident rates, indicating that uncoupling people&#x27;s decisions from unpleasant consequences, even partially, causes them to make worse decisions.",1376016304
6183419,comment,6183155,6183391,4,0,djestrada,,,"I left the following comment in a reddit thread:<p>Hi Thorse! I&#x27;m one of the developers for Swarm. You comments are well taken, and deserve a response.
Our strategy for collecting and presenting data about collective action abstracts away from individual habits. We&#x27;re interested in features of collective action (at the &#x27;caste&#x27; and &#x27;colony&#x27; level), not your personal daily routine. The data we collect will be groomed to remove individual data in such a way that, I hope, would allow people who are as concerned about privacy as you and I both are to confidently use the app.<p>The other thing to make clear is that not everyone needs to play Swarm in order to build useful models for everyone. Consider Yelp!: maybe you don&#x27;t want people to know your eating habits, but some people love leaving reviews. That record potentially helps anyone looking for a restaurant, whether or not they contribute their own opinions to the record. Similarly, Swarm trails might be useful to you whether or not you contribute to the trails yourself.
I would also (humbly) object to the claim that Swarm! treats your life habits as a game mechanic. Your life is your life. Swarm doesn&#x27;t intrude on that process to give you 100 points for buying chips at the store, or anything so cheap. The game aspects of Swarm interact with trails at an abstracted level, in order to reveal patterns about collective human behavior; but it won&#x27;t be possible on a system like ours to watch, mess or interact with, or otherwise represent the activity of individual players directly.<p>Its not about you, this is about us. For instance, which are the most scenic trails in Inwood Park? A populated Swarm! map instantly tells me how the populations that have traversed these trails before have distributed their walking patterns along the park. From passive players I see their aggregated preferences, and from the active players I may have incentive (both in game and out) to respond to the attractions theyve built in the course of their travels. From that information I might choose to trust the reliability of the crowd, or contribute to the inspection of a road less traveled, or blaze a new trail altogether.
In other words, you can live your life however you want; Swarm! just lets you do it with the ant superpower of instant access to collective memory. As long as enough people have that superpower, we&#x27;ll all be a little smarter.<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jysa5/our_first_look_at_the_only_mmo_currently_being/cbjw1sp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jysa5/our_first_loo...</a>",1376016273

6183350,comment,6182374,6183103,10,0,bane,,,"I recently went to two malls in my area that, when I last visited them a decade ago were bustling with shoppers.<p>In one mall, I walked through a Macy&#x27;s that may have had only 5 shoppers (I&#x27;m reserving &quot;customers&quot; as we weren&#x27;t one until we actually bought something) in the entire store. The tile floor of the store was crumbling, wallpaper was peeling, everything felt old and ancient. I didn&#x27;t want to be there.<p>In one mall, there was an entire wing of the mall that was almost completely abandoned and probably 30-40% of the mall was vacant store fronts. The food court I used to spend hours in consisted of a McDonald&#x27;s and a Chinese fast food place. I remember years ago when it hosted a dozen different places, all with long lines. Getting a table to eat at required a friend to go reserve a table for you. These days? 3 people eat big macs in an empty large echoy room. It used to be the social center for the town, today it&#x27;s nearly abandoned.<p>Amazon and other online shopping venues <i>decimated</i> these brick and mortar shopping venues. And it&#x27;s not clear that it&#x27;s generating the same amount of raw revenue in return either. It&#x27;s <i>definitely</i> annihilating retail jobs in a way that Walmart could never hope to approach, yet it&#x27;s rarely if ever discussed. At best, retail Macy&#x27;s jobs are being replaced with contract warehouse work at a local fulfillment center, but automation and the loss of the requirement to interface with the customer means these places only require a fraction of the employees to move the same volume of inventory.<p>I don&#x27;t know if the pendulum will ever swing the other way. My wife for example, buys clothes almost exclusively on-line. It&#x27;s almost unthinkable that she does this, you want to try on clothes after all. But she overbuys a little, and only goes to the physical store to return items that don&#x27;t fit or she doesn&#x27;t like. The once proud storefront has been turned into the return counter in the customer service center. Why? &quot;I don&#x27;t like dealing with all the crowds and it&#x27;s such a hassle to go there to see if things are on sale, I&#x27;ll just check the web site every few days instead.&quot;<p>About the only brick and mortar we hit with any regularity these days is Costco, and that&#x27;s largely because their wine selection is cheaper than online and very nearly always well selected and we can buy bulk toiletries and cleaning supplies at a discount.",1376015473

  I wanted to get your feedback on a feature I was thinking of adding to <a href=&quot;http://sharecred.com&quot;>ShareCred</a>. Before I proceed, my sincere thanks for taking your time and providing your valuable feedback! Thanks!<p>As you may know, <a href=&quot;http://sharecred.com&quot;>ShareCred</a> is based on the  philosophy that we need to reach out to people outside of our immediate circle. (Yes, HN allows that, agreed, but HN is very limited in expression, and not really interested in exploring the possibilities. You can think of ShareCred as similar to HN, but based on a blogging model, and bringing in controls based on one&#x27;s relationship and expertise.)<p>Assuming that you are with me so far (with regards to what ShareCred is), I would like to ask if the following feature is of any interest to anyone.<p><b>Feature:</b> Ask questions to our 1st, 2nd, 3rd degree of relations (or to people with certain recognition), and getting feedback anonymously or not.<p>You can think of Quora being brought down to your 1st/2nd/3rd degree relations or people of certain recognition.<p>What I am seeing in this idea is couple of things. 1. Asking questions to people outside of your circle, but still controlled. 2. Getting answers anonymously from people in your circle, or not.<p>For example, a question such as &#x27;What wine do you drink?&#x27; is not something we want to put on Quora (of course, you can put on Facebook, but as I argued sometime back, it has limitations.) Such questions are ripe for limiting to your circles, and in some cases, benefit from anonymity.<p>What do you think?<p>Thanks again for your time,

That&#x27;s not to say there aren&#x27;t many noble academics pursuing the truth and publishing only verified, repeatable findings ... it is just that they seem to be unfortunately in the minority within the zeitgeist that presently drives the climate of our academic research institutions.

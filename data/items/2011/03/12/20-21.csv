The security threats that plagued the internet in the 90s are now obsolete. With new technology comes new threats. That's the way it will be and the only option we have is to stay vigilant and attempt to think of every edge case before black hats do.<p>To say that a walled garden is the solution is a dangerous statement. While this may provide a very safe platform such as iOS, it is also a stifled and languid platform due to the bottleneck of the approval process.

There's a placebo affect, for one thing, which would be transmitted from parent to child through the parent's mood and expectations, plus there are random fluctuations in the child's behavior from day to day that will be attributed to whatever is foremost in the parent's mind, which in this case would be the alteration in diet.<p>People do this stuff all the time when cutting out gluten, starting to take fish oil, etc.  It's really weird how someone will choose one thing at random out of all the alternatives, because that thing was pitched to them at just the right time by just the right person, and immediately start to believe it is a powerful force in their lives.  There are dozens of dietary ""miracle cures"" for ailments ranging from depression to acne, and for each one, there are many people who swear by it.  A trained doctor can be helpful in tempering expectations, reminding parents that short-term changes can't be taken seriously, and forcing a patient approach.<p>For instance, if peanut butter is cut from the kid's diet, and two days later the kid has a really bad day at school, many parents would jump to the conclusion that peanut butter was the only thing keeping the kid sane and start feeding it to him every day in every form they could think of.  That would be a very bad thing if peanut butter was actually what was causing the problem.  The doctor's job is to persuade the parents to be patient and evaluate the evidence more reasonably.",1299962789

Quite a nice read, and even a good skim (you can pick up nearly everything just by looking at the pictures and reading the intro paragraphs).<p>I think it really only applies to books which seek to be decorative objects as well as literature, however.  The wide outside margin allows for side notes or decorative borders, and the bottom is similar to how pictures are matted for display in galleries - ""heavier"" bottoms have a subtle but important impact.  It also creates room for detached footnotes or larger decorations.  The thinner inside margins help keep text on a readable level due to the book binding techniques (remember, books were typically thicker when scribes did the work).<p>But without that decoration, I'm pretty sure the small blocks of black text would act as an optical illusion, making them appear smaller than they are.

Descriptions are listed below if you need.<p>Thanks!<p>---\nDescriptions\n---<p><i></i>Computer Security<i></i>\nThis is an introductory course covering the fundamentals of computer security. In particular, the course will cover basic concepts of computer security such as threat models and security policies, and will show how these concepts apply to specific areas such as communication security, software security, operating systems security, network security, web security, and hardware-based security.<p><i></i>Computer Networking<i></i>\nTheory and practice of computer networks, emphasizing the principles underlying the design of network software and the role of the communications system in distributed computing. Topics include routing, flow and congestion control, end-to-end protocols, and multicast.<p><i></i>Database Design<i></i>\nFunctions of a database system. Data modeling and logical database design. Query languages and query optimization. Efficient data storage and access. Database access through standalone and web applications.<p><i></i>Green Computing<i></i>\nThis course covers fundamental principles of energy management faced by designers of hardware, operating systems, and data centers. We will explore basic energy management option in individual components such as CPUs, network interfaces, hard drives, memory. We will further present the energy management policies at the operating system level that consider performance vs. energy saving tradeoffs. Finally we will consider large scale data centers where energy management is done at multiple layers from individual components in the system to shutting down entries subset of machines. We will also discuss energy generation and delivery and well as cooling issues in large data centers.<p><i></i>Compilers/Systems Software<i></i>\nBasic concepts of compilation and related systems software. Topics include lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, code generation; assemblers, loaders, linkers; debuggers.<p><i></i>Operating Systems<i></i>\nConcepts of modern operating systems; concurrent processes; process synchronization and communication; resource allocation; kernels; deadlock; memory management; file systems.<p><i></i>Algorithms<i></i>\nIntroduction to the design and analysis of algorithms: basic analysis techniques (asymptotics, sums, recurrences); basic design techniques (divide and conquer, dynamic programming, greedy, amortization); acquiring an algorithm repertoire (sorting, median finding, strong components, spanning trees, shortest paths, maximum flow, string matching); and handling intractability (approximation algorithms, branch and bound).<p><i></i>Automata<i></i>\nIntroduction to models of computation (finite automata, pushdown automata, Turing machines), representations of languages (regular expressions, context-free grammars), and the basic hierarchy of languages (regular, context-free, decidable, and undecidable languages).<p><i></i>Geometric Algorithms<i></i>\nThe study of algorithms for geometric objects, using a computational geometry approach, with an emphasis on applications for graphics, VLSI, GIS, robotics, and sensor networks.

I seem to like to work in blocks of four hours if I am going to get anything non-trivial done.<p>I recently ran aground when trying to explain this to my wife.  She is in the medical field, where tasks are presented and dealt with pretty much as they come.  Her world has never had a need for the kind of deep, problem-solving type of concentration so common in programming and engineering.<p>In sharp contrast to her life experience, mine has always had this sort of reality.  From playing chess, to electrical engineering and software engineering.<p>I was floored when she explained that she could not comprehend why I couldn't just get things done and insist that it is impossible to get anything done when the kids interrupt every 2, 5, 15 or 30 minutes.  She also can't understand how it is that an interruption can cost your hours, as you find your way back into this mental ""groove"" and, if you are lucky, remember where you left off.<p>We are not fighting, I am just trying to explain because I have been working from home a whole lot more and I need cooperation in setting up a suitable work environment.  For the most part the kids are at school and I am alone, so no big deal...but come crunch time I need the extra hours and it is hard to get them.<p>What I am hoping someone here can help with is a link or links to articles that explain and explore the type or mental state and concentration common in these types of occupations.  She understands research papers and, of course, articles from an authority such as a cognitive science researcher would be fantastic.<p>What is your own experience?  How do you explain these kinds of things to someone who really doesn't have a frame of reference to understand from and all that is left is for them to take your word for it?<p>Thanks!",1299960291

If it's just the two of you, 2% is on the low side, but I wouldn't necessarily walk away from it. If there are others who were there pre-funding, then 2% sounds about right.<p>Other things to consider:<p>- What do you think of the product you're building? Are there others like it? What is unique about this one? Would you use it? Is there a voice in the back of your head telling you saying that this is great, or that this is dumb, or that it has fatal problems? Listen to it and think about what it's telling you.<p>- Similarly, what is your instinctual reaction to the founder? Is he focused, or does he have shiny object syndrome? What value does he bring to the venture, other than having convinced someone to fund it? Does his background and track record suggest that he can make this work? Or that he's worth betting on?<p>Good luck.",1299960083

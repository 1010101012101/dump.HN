Here are some of his smaller beauties<p>Awake<p><pre><code>    *Awake for hours and staring at the ceiling 
    Through the unsettled stillness of the night 
    He grows possessed of the obsessive feeling 
    That dawn has come and gone and brought no light.*

    Far from the ones you love, 
    No hand to left or right 
    And emptiness above -

    Some for two nights or one, 
    And some for all their years.*

Despite the posh surroundings, Fushman and Agarwal wax poetic about the egalitarian culture Houston and Ferdowsi have created. &quot;It’s really hard to pull off creating an environment of peers,&quot; says Agarwal, a former engineering director at Facebook who oversaw the development of its News Feed. &quot;We hold ourselves accountable to expectations, and at a bunch of companies, that ends up being centralized.

The only manuals I had was one listing the various MS-DOS commands (sadly, excluding anything about debug.exe though) and one that was a command reference for gwbasic.exe [1].<p>I spent many hours trying to write games in gw-basic but quickly realised that the performance was atrocious, to say the least. Eventually I stumbled across a magazine that had a two-page article about debug.exe and it was my gateway to a whole new hidden world. I went on to learn 8086 assembly with debug.exe by trial and error and from stepping through other programs. Eventually I figured out I could write little 8086 assembly routines in debug.exe myself, take the sequence of bytes that made up that routine, declare them as a DATA statement in a BASIC program and then just make call that DATA line to run the machine code directly [2]. It wasn&#x27;t until many months later I finally managed to get my hands on some compilers and assemblers (Borland Turbo Pascal and Turbo Assembler being my favourites back then) which of course made my life a whole lot easier! I continued to use debug.exe for many years though, primarily for reverse engineering.<p>I&#x27;ve just managed to dig up an obfuscated &quot;Hello World&quot; batch file I wrote many years ago that makes use of debug.exe, see [3] below (If you actually want to run it you&#x27;ll probably need an MS-DOS emulator [4][5] or  an older version of Windows that still has debug.exe).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.antonis.de/qbebooks/gwbasman/appendix%20d.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.antonis.de/qbebooks/gwbasman/appendix%20d.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.redyeti.net/extra/hello.bat"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.redyeti.net/extra/hello.bat</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://jamesfriend.com.au/pce-js/ibmpc-games/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jamesfriend.com.au/pce-js/ibmpc-games/</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.dosbox.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dosbox.com/</a>",1427755355

9293060,comment,9292513,9292513,0,0,yellowapple,,,"> i saw that its job market is declining<p>Where?  Rails is still incredibly popular last I checked.  It&#x27;s not getting as much press lately as, say, Node.js or whatever frameworks Go has, but the job market for Rails developers is still pretty strong, if not one of the strongest.<p>> what is the hottest things right now in development job market ?<p>COBOL.<p>I shit you not.<p>You would not <i>believe</i> how many government agencies, financial institutions, healthcare facilities, etc. still rely upon ancient COBOL codebases running on ancient mainframes that are currently maintained by ancient programmers on the verge of retirement.  New COBOL programmers are in <i>very</i> high demand, but the supply is atrociously low (for good reason; COBOL makes PHP look as elegant as Lisp in comparison).  If you can list COBOL expertise on a CV/resume, you will be hired; it&#x27;s cheaper to hire you for hundreds of dollars an hour than to hire a full development team for even more hundreds of dollars an hour to migrate to a modern platform.<p>---<p>If, on the other hand, you&#x27;re <i>not</i> in a masochistic mood, you&#x27;re pretty well served learning Rails (or any other &quot;model-view-controller&quot; or &quot;MVC&quot; framework, like Django or Catalyst or what have you); once you&#x27;re intimately familiar with MVC concepts and how your models/views/controllers are implemented and interact with one another, moving to another framework is just a matter of learning new syntax.<p>If that&#x27;s not enough, might I suggest Erlang/OTP (or perhaps its children, like Elixir or LFE)?  It&#x27;s been getting some well-deserved praise lately for being very well suited for networked software development (including web development).  If you&#x27;re already familiar with Ruby/Rails, Elixir (along with one of the web/MVC frameworks for it, like Phoenix or Sugar) would be a good fit.  Quite a few projects use Erlang extensively (Heroku, GitHub, and (if I remember right) Chef use a lot of Erlang, usually to route requests to subprograms written in other languages like Ruby).  If nothing else, though, it&#x27;ll give you a good background in concurrent programming, knowledge of which is increasingly sought after in modern web-facing application development (as evidenced by the recent popularity of Go and Rust, both of which promise better concurrency models than existing non-Erlang solutions).<p>While you&#x27;re at it, being familiar with JSON and SQL is a good thing, regardless of what other technology/ies you end up going with; even if you don&#x27;t ever work with those things directly, JSON and SQL (particularly in the form of PostgreSQL) are increasingly-ubiquitous in modern web-facing software (which is where most of the market is).<p>In reality, unless you&#x27;re learning something fairly exotic (like Prolog or PL/I) or absurdly new, you&#x27;ll be fine job-wise.  Even languages whose glory days have faded - like PHP and Perl - have lots of job opportunities, whether from existing codebases needing maintenance (Wordpress comes to mind) or relatively-new codebases that still feel those languages are the best fit (DuckDuckGo comes to mind).  Java - like COBOL but not <i>quite</i> like COBOL - is another example of a language with a <i>lot</i> of enterprise users in high demand for those fluent in it to help maintain those codebases.<p>---<p>In summary, yes, Rails is totally worth your time to learn for employment opportunity.  It still has a <i>very</i> strong job market, and even if it someday doesn&#x27;t, the MVC concepts you&#x27;ll learn by learning Rails will apply directly to most other modern (and probably future) web frameworks, thus helping you learn those new frameworks and continue to be employable.<p>That all said, learning a language or framework or somesuch solely because it&#x27;ll easily land you a job is a good way to make you hate programming someday.  Learn a language because you like that language, not <i>just</i> because you want a paycheck.",1427754485

We finally met 3 days ago about her project, and she told me she has seen 5 freelancers and 2 agencies for her website, but she still wanted to speak with me because she wasn&#x27;t decided yet.<p>The first thing I asked her was: &quot;Can you explain me about your business ? And what process the customer is going through ?&quot;. Then we went through a pleasant hour-long brainstorming phase, until she realized her point was totally different from the existing website she wanted to copy, and that we ended up with a way better and more suited solution for her. She surpisingly said : &quot;You&#x27;re the only one that asked me those things, and I loved it!&quot;.<p>Then I asked her how it went with those 7 other clients and she told me nobody cared about her business, and how they only seemed to want to get the contract, at any price.

When you&#x27;re the right person, your time is invaluable, and your price will be the right one.<p>In conclusion, there is a lot of bad freelancers out there.

It&#x27;s also sad to ponder, as Moxie has, that it seems PGP isn&#x27;t even being used widely enough to make it worthwhile for attackers to try to DoS the web of trust, let alone to try to trick people into using the wrong keys on a large scale.  (That is, PGP hasn&#x27;t even reached Gandhi&#x27;s &quot;then they fight you&quot; stage in the mass market.)  This isn&#x27;t to deny that PGP has provided major communications security benefits to smaller communities and groups that have consciously adopted it and use it carefully.",1427754138

His style is a casual one, but bursts with sidelong allusions to history, literature, art and etymological punnery. Perhaps of particular interest to people here, might be his novel-length poem Madoc, an hallucinogenic journey through time and place, in which &quot;[he] supposes that Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey took up their (actual) fancy of founding a Pantisocratic community in North America.&quot;<p>Ciaran Carson,<p>Took a break from writing through most of the 70s to travel with his wife playing traditional music and steep himself in the Irish storytelling tradition. His books since then have been an, at time excitingly precarious, marriage of traditional storytelling and a modernist mock pedanticism. Worth checking out is his Belfast Confetti, a mix of essays and poems which explore the psychological relationship one has to one&#x27;s city.<p>Leontia Flynn,    
A much younger poet, of the generation of artists who have had to deal with adapting to life and working in the 21st Century. Her last book, from 2011, Profit & Loss is a striking meditation on the changing role of memory in pre- and post- Internet society.<p>And for something different that I would particularly recommend to the HN crowd,<p>Sam Riviere,<p>An English poet of the current generation who deals with the cognitive fallout of the ever varied linguistic and cultural deluge one experiences day to day in 2015.

When did we stop caring about growth? Making things better? More efficient?

You&#x27;re right.<p>tldr: but it would be incredibly incredibly difficult (and perhaps provably impossible in a free-ish society) to grow the economy without also encouraging and making technological growth (also finding oil deposits, other discoveries, etc)<p>Growth comes from a few things. 1, operating at max utilization. Full employment. Going from 50% to 90% will grow the GDP. 2, saving. Saving what we already have. Building bridges, long lasting homes, etc to that we can be more efficient and focus on other problems in the future. Note, this does not increase yearly GDP but it increases overall wealth per capita.  For example, many europeans live and benefit from homes that were built for them hundreds of years ago. They&#x27;re free to worry less about building homes and more on improving other aspects of their lives. 3, technological progress.<p>While it&#x27;s true gorwth != tech progress, its also certain that growing the economy by #1 and #2 above will allow more room for people to work on #3. #2 is important. We can&#x27;t work on nuclear physics before we build homes from physicists to live in. Likewise #1 is important. for every person that becomes employed, their handwork allows other people to focus on other things, research. We need enough farmers to feed researchers. The more farmers, the more researchers. So in a sense, you can, but it would be incredibly difficult to grow the economy without also encouraging and making technological growth.",1427753503

def testFun(x): ... assume(not isnan(x))...&quot; -- I immediately would prefer to decorate/document my functions (that could be test functions, but more generally my &quot;real&quot; functions) with these pre-/post- conditions and assumtions, and generate the tests, something like:<p><pre><code>    @assert(idempotent) #(inv(inv(x))==x)
    def inv(x):
      &quot;Return -x&quot;
      @given(float):
        @assume(not isnan(x))
      return -x

Typing this out, I can see why they go in the tests (avoids going down the rabbithole of creating a partially typed version of python...) -- which is why @assume(float) isn&#x27;t on top; it&#x27;d imply inv didn&#x27;t work for integers. Maybe a weaker:<p><pre><code>    @assume(not isnan(x)) #implies x is number, but not nan
    @idempotent # inv(inv(x)) == x
    def inv(x):
      return -x
</code></pre>
Now it should be possible to infer that inv(x) should be checked with numbers, and that it is idempotent. Might be a weak test unless one can specfify a few other things - but maybe such pre/post &quot;hints&quot; could be combined to make better short tests? Eg that one could give a different expression to check against rather than the function itself: def test_inv(): assert(inv(x), lambda y: -y)?<p>At any rate, interesting framework.",1427753114

When we only have 1-3 kids rather than 6-10 (of which 4 live to adulthood), it makes sense to put more energy into improving the ability of each one.<p>It&#x27;s not always some place to spend money.  It can be the park that you&#x27;re meeting your kid&#x27;s best friend at, or the natural history museum you go to every day after school, or just your friend&#x27;s house or the field that your soccer practice meets at.  Sure, you can stay in the area within a few miles of your home/school and get around exclusively by bike or walking, but lots of kids and parents want more than that.",1427752935

9292921,comment,9290697,9291574,0,0,jsolson,,,"I was born in 1983, so that puts me at the leading edge of what I think most people classify as millennials, but honestly what you&#x27;re saying doesn&#x27;t resonate strongly with me. I can (and have recently) lived without a car, but not for any of the reasons you cite. Instead it comes down to (a) parking is a pain in the ass in downtown Seattle and (b) if I drive somewhere, I avoid drinking while I&#x27;m there, so driving is a no-go for shows, parties, or even most evenings out with friends. Both of these are solved pretty thoroughly by Uber and (rarely) public transit. I don&#x27;t tend to use my phone when I&#x27;m moving between places unless I&#x27;m running late or someone pings me; I&#x27;m much more likely to sit back and just watch the world go by.<p>That said, I do own a car primarily for my daily commute and weekend outings up to the mountains. In terms of safety, environmental friendliness, or cost effectiveness, none of these factored at all into the decision for me. That said, I drive a Tesla, so it&#x27;s chock full of modern safety features (protecting me; for pedestrians it&#x27;s a silent rolling death machine with 691 horsepower), and I could argue that it&#x27;s less environmentally unfriendly than other cars, but I bought it because it looked fun, not for either of those reasons :)",1427752875

Innovation is good for any kind of organization, if done properly. What the author should focus on is the lack of <i>agility</i> that prevents companies from experimenting and failing quickly. It&#x27;s not the innovative technology that gets you in the end, it&#x27;s your inability to evaluate/adopt/discard fast. Granted, that ability is hard to find in large-ish organizations, but to willingly limit your innovation sounds like a recipe for a slow death.

Comes across as easy to use but with some nice power features.<p>The landing page screenshot has been poorly resized however. I'd make that a bit bigger and prettier, and you could even go so far as adding slick little javascript tooltips to explain different tools. Could help your conversion rates maybe? Also perhaps consider using the same shiny green 'Try It Now' button on the bottom of the tour pages, instead of switching to a text link.

Carter's desire for regime change in Iran certainly didn't take into account any reports on possible downsides (including external ones, like Sadam deciding Iran was vulnerable and starting a war that killed a million men), and he dearly needed serious HUMINT after the hostages were taken (which was probably #2 after the economy in ensuring his defeat in 1980).<p>Does anyone remember how totally surprised he was by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan?  We'll never know if the CIA could have helped avoid that blindness (probably not, too much of it was willful or just not understanding simple realities like the nature of the Soviet Union and its leaders), but by deliberately gutting its HUMINT in favor of ""national technical means"" (SIGINT and TECHINT (e.g. spy satellites)) he all but ensured he'd be flying blind afterwords.",1268827335

Just because you're a vegetarian, it doesn't mean you suffer a shortage of the particular amino acids required for producing creatine. Most vegetarians fall under the ""ovo-lacto"" umbrella, meaning they will eat egg and milk, and pretty much anything else made by animals, just not the animals themselves - being a vegetarian myself, I often say: ""I'll eat food made by animals, just not food made OF animals"" - and many vegetarians also use various ""fullworthy"" protein supplements containing all the essential amino acids, guaranteeing them all the components needed to produce creatine while being a vegetarian.<p>I myself use protein supplements to ensure, together with food, that I get a bit more than 1 gram of fullworthy protein per kilo body weight a day, and that is an amount that actually even meat-eaters, without supplements, can have a hard time reaching on a daily basis.<p>Addendum:<p>Digging a little bit on Wikipedia, I found the three amino acids (of which only one is essential) that Creatine is produced from in the body:<p>Arginine (non-essential) - vegetabilic sources: ""wheat germ and flour, buckwheat, granola, oatmeal, peanuts, nuts (coconut, pecans, cashews, walnuts, almonds, Brazil nuts, hazelnuts, pinenuts), seeds (pumpkin, sesame, sunflower), chick peas, cooked soybeans.""<p>Glycine (non-essential) - synthesized in the human body from  Serine, also a non-essential amino acid.<p>Methionine (essential) - vegetabilic (and animalic) sources: ""High levels of methionine can be found in sesame seeds, Brazil nuts, fish, meats and some other plant seeds; methionine is also found in cereal grains.""<p>Judging from this, it seems that a vegetarian has to maintain a really lousy and unhealthy diet in order to suffer a Creatine shortage. Maybe the test subjects were university students on a Ramen diet.",1268827310

Of course also here nobody will tell you why they did not employ you, but one thing is obvious: with 30 I wrote 2-3 applications and usually had the choice between 2-3 jobs. Nowadays I don't even get replies anymore.<p>One problem that I see is the relative age compared to the future collegues. With >40 you usually know a hell of a lot more than mid 20s. Unfortunately this includes the managers who are often also <30.<p>The best idea is indeed Tichys: gather experience, knowledge and money as long as you can and then do a startup later. This does not necessarily exclude family. At 25 we may not need so much cash but with a family in the background there should be at least one (hopefully secure) income in the background.",1199713781

The ""enhanced user design"" just gets in the way. It seems that MS just worked on happy-to-glad UI issues.",1199712239

Most companies won't take a flyer on you if you don't have X years of professional experience, and its impossible to have that X number when you are in your early 20s.<p>And 10 years of experience people get paid twice as much as 3 yrs of experience people regardless of talent.<p>I wish there was a way to create a standardized hacker test.",1199711282

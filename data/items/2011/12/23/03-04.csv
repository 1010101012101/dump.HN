It's a maximum liability to PayPal of something like $800 (including typical chargeback fees) out of a million dollars in revenue. Most of those disputes are probably just disputes, not chargebacks, anyway -- people clicking ""item not received"" because they weren't tech-savvy and had trouble with the download process or the video didn't play on their computer right.<p>PayPal isn't worried until your chargebacks are more than 1-2% of your volume. With a dispute rate that <i>low</i> on so much volume, he's helping <i>bring down</i> PayPal's overall CB rate with their banks (Wells Fargo and Chase), doing the company a favor.<p>Not only will Louis's account not be frozen when he withdraws the money, but his dispute rate as a percentage of volume is so low, the mails he gets about them will say ""because your chargeback rate is so low, we are allowing you to keep the funds until the end of the investigation"". I know this because that's what they send me, too.<p>This is standard operating procedure at PayPal. Louis CK is their optimal merchant in almost every way. Even if their business processes were so terrible as to want to close this account, which they aren't, it's not a company of fools -- this account is run by a celebrity selling a virtually no-risk product and brings in $50,000 a month in fee revenues for PayPal.",1324612770

Just quickly browsing, I found the following essential books missing:<p><pre><code>  * In algorithms: \n    - Aho, Hopcroft, Ullman: The Design and Analysis of Algorithms.\n    - Wirth: Algorithms and Data Structures.\n  * In Compilers:\n    - Wirth: Compiler Construction.\n    - Grune, Bal, Jacobs, Cerial: Modern Compiler Design.\n    - Muchnick: Advanced Compiler Design and Implementation.\n  * In Lambda calculus:\n    - Barendregt: Introduction to Lambda Calculus.\n  * In theoretical computer science:\n    - Kozen: Automata and Computability.\n    - Davis: Computability and Unsolvability.\n  * In concepts of PLs:\n    - Turbak, Gifford, Sheldon: Design Concepts in Programming Languages.\n</code></pre>\n(In general, the list does not mention any of Wirth's books, which is a shame.

That puts firefox at 11% of google's searches.  I think then about 8-9% of google income would be a good estimate- couldn't quickly find any data on what % of their income comes from search, but <a href=""http://www.coastdigital.co.uk/news/google-gives-breakdown-of-revenue-for-the-first-time/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coastdigital.co.uk/news/google-gives-breakdown-of...</a> shows that it def isn't 100%.",1324610986

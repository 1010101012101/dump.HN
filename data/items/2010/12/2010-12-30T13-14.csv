Also, I don't think that's all bad: ""How much have you voted in the past?  And do you plan to vote again next time?"" is a pretty good proxy for ""How much do you care about current issues?""  Not voting is a way for the less informed/concerned to defer to the more informed/concerned.  In an ideal world everyone would be fully informed and concerned, and so everyone would vote, but humans aren't ideal and our system handles that fact pretty well.<p>Furthermore, while there generally is a diffrence of about 5 points between likely voters and registered voters, and another five points between registered voters and adults, there's no way that a 1:5 ratio is going to swing the opposite way due to the difference between likely voters and the general population.

2052146,comment,2051901,2051901,0,0,edw519,,,"A few stories behind the pictures:<p>- The programmer is probably playing guitar because he is waiting for his compile.  It had to be batched and returned, sometimes hours later.  Imagine getting things done with only one compile per day.<p>- The programmer is giving an obscene gesture to the terminal because he forgot a semicolon (more likely a period in his COBOL program) and will now have to wait another day for a clean compile.  Move that deadline back to October.<p>- The terminal the programmer is giving an obscene gesture to is a state-of-the-art Datawriter, a PAPER-DRIVEN terminal.  A moment of silence is needed for all the trees sacrificed for our future.<p>- The programmer was special because he had access to the Datawriter, which was probably in the computer room.   Anyone else, including all users, had to use pencil and special forms (like taking their SATs) to enter data into the IBM Mainframe.  Those forms went to the Data Control Unit where teams of mostly women keypunched the data onto 80 column cards which were fed into a hopper.  The early keypunch machines put the holes in the cards as you typed, so that if you made a mistake, you had to start over with a new card.  Later, these machines had memory, so you could finish the virtual card, and hit a key that did the whole card.  Probably saved a lot of paper.<p>- Notice all the coats hanging in the break room.  It may have been winter, but just as likely, they were needed in the computer room.  It was cold in there!<p>- Note that the ""Data Terminal"" pictures are at the bottom of the page in the mini-computer section.  This was a big deal back then.  Mini-computers got CRT displays before IBM mainframes.  That's how they competed with Big Blue.  For programmers, this was as big an advance as we would ever get.  Imagine building that web app today, buying cases of cards from Office Depot and getting one compile per day.<p>- The Demonstration Center was a big deal, too.  Several places I worked had the computer room behind glass in the lobby.  Companies wanted their customers to physically see how advanced their technology was.<p>Thanks for the memories.

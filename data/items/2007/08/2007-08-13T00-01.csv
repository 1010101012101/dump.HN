41777,comment,41716,41716,0,0,ambition,,,"OK, here is some of the ""why"" of facebook for those of us who aren't heavy users.<p>Facebook is casual and useful. <p>It's easy to set up an event or fundraiser, invite everyone you know, put up pictures about the event, and so on. <p>Many comments show that there are expectations for use cases that Facebook really isn't about. ""Having hundreds of 'friends' is pointless."" ""...looking for dates...met someone interesting..."" That's not what Facebook is about, nor intended to be.<p>Yep, you can stay in touch with your close friends on Facebook if you really want. Many people do. But, it's really about those hundreds of people you still care about, but you don't see on a regular basis. It is the best way to keep tabs on them. It's also great for setting plans with them. As a personal side note, Facebook has led to several happy reunions with old friends after I lost their contact information for years.<p>More about the idea of ""Facebook is casual"". Facebook messages have injected themselves between email and IM on the formality spectrum, and wall posts are now between Messages and IM. You can initiate conversation with people who would otherwise find it odd. Like, say, members of the attractive sex. <p>The common theme is that Facebook pleases our in-born psychological social instincts. It is a fine lesson in human factors. <p>Yet more. The cool kids are on facebook. You know, the ones that we're supposed to hate as self-respecting geeks, because we're smarter but they somehow have more fun? That means people who care about being cool get on Facebook. (Although rebellion is cool, so now it's cool to take a stand against Facebook and stay off. But that's a whole other story.)<p>It's a perfectly acceptable social norm to ""Facebook-stalk"" someone: To look up their interests when you're interested in them. That's a big one. <p>It's a handy, casual way of passing around contact information. Once you know someone's name and a little bit about them, you can find them on Facebook. You don't need to ask for their phone number or IM or email address, find somewhere to write it down, and take 30 awkward seconds to do it. You just say, ""Let's find each other on Facebook."" To be clear: Facebook makes it just a little bit easier to pick up. Also, friending is a no-cost way of sending goodwill.<p>So that's why people use Facebook.<p>People on this discussion board love news about Facebook because Facebook is every tech entrepreneur's wet dream. Zuckerberg is young, modest, smart and very, very rich. Startup founders love to dream about Facebook-like success because that's what they all want. It's intellectual masturbation. When someone posts insights about Facebook's success, instant nerdgasm. Also, Facebook is an important enough influence on mainstream digital life that few Web entrepreneurs can ignore it. Facebook app clones can kill fledgling independent applications fast. And if Facebook manages to get people used to spending money while on Facebook, they could rival Google, Amazon, and Ebay in importance. <p>Finally, a note about the 'stolen idea'. Let's ignore that where the idea came from is irrelevant to Facebook's current utility and success. You ought to realize that ideas are near-worthless and execution is everything. FB is a case study in excellent execution. They hire brilliant developers just like Joel says, and they built a very clean UI as a competitive advantage over Myspace. Nearly all successful businesses are based on incremental improvements on existing ideas with great execution. <p>Put it this way: ""Online store"" is not terribly creative, but pg is rich and famous today because his gang of hackers had the best execution in building one. Search engines were not a new idea when Google took over the world. Nor were operating systems or word processors when Microsoft did before that. Online social networks were not new. They just sucked enough that there was room for Facebook to step in a build a better one.

41775,comment,41716,41727,0,0,marketer,,,"That question surprised me, because the purpose of billion-dollar businesses can usually be summed up in a few words. <p>Everybody has different uses for facebook, which is one of the reasons that it is so popular. To me, being able to see how ALL of your friends are doing is invaluable. I can log on and see the the state of my friends' lives, and not just my college friends, but people from any given stage of my life. I can find out where friend A is working, or whether  friend B is single, etc.. It's ultimately about keeping connected. ",1186966208

41773,comment,41709,41744,0,0,Jd,,,"I'd like to think that is true but don't see evidence to support it. For instance, blogs don't seem to solve the problem of aggregation, which requires a special group of editors to evaluate content quality.  <p>Consequently, I wouldn't expect the best reporters to be able to make more - I'd expect the worst reporters to make the most money.  That is, those that are willing to dumb down/spice up the content so that it sells well.  I call this the News Corp/Myspace effect and don't see any effective counter.  <p>Do you?<p>

41772,comment,41716,41716,0,0,aaroniba,,,"Facebook is a utility, not just a frivolous form of entertainment.  Users depend on the service to manage contacts, share photos, and meet new people.  A lot of important information flows through the facebook social graph.<p>The posts here remind me of the guy who loves to brag about how he doesn't have a TV in his house.  To each his own, but television has had a huge impact on business and culture world-wide.<p>So even if you don't personally want to be a Facebook user, you might think about how it is transforming the way a whole generation of people interact socially, recognize the business and cultural impact, and conclude that you should care about it anyway.",1186965587

41769,comment,41709,41709,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"There are two aspects to what we think of as a ""newspaper"": the physical medium and the content - aggregation of mainstream print journalism.<p>The physical medium of paper is in many ways superior to our current generation of displays. It won't go away until we have daylight readable 20000:1 contrast-ratio flexible displays. That doesn't mean the print-newspaper business isn't doomed.   Subscription numbers are in a nose dive, and still have a long way to fall.<p>Yet the aggregation of mainstream print journalism via a different medium still has a chance for success.  The killer app for mainstream media is producing quality content. Bloggers can't support foreign offices, for example. Micheal Yon, Micheal Totten and other ""embedded bloggers"" are the exceptions that prove the rule. Distributed locality where you don't need a correspondent in, say, Beijing because Chinese Bloggers cover it, only partially solves this. There is something to be said for an expert outsider reporting news & trends.<p>So newspapers aren't necessarily screwed. If there were a way to directly support good content proportional to its value, good written journalism provided by online newspapers could survive and even thrive. The high hurdles of subscription and premium content and the indirect path of ad revenue aren't good enough. The article is right about the numbers.<p>I'm working on a startup that would allow a distributed set of people to directly support online content. In this way, newspapers could evolve to become aggregations of professional bloggers and journalists, providing high quality content for a profit.",1186965069

41767,comment,41716,41716,0,0,Jd,,,"I think one should distinguish between 'care about' and 'like.'<p>Facebook has utility as a constantly updated online address book.  It also has tremendous market share and the Facebook API could lead to much of social-networking for the next half-decade being trapped in the Facebook world.  Consequently, I care about Facebook.<p>I do not like Facebook.  I do not like Zuckerberg.  I do not use any Facebook applications because they all seem to be ridiculous time wasters.  Maybe at some point this will change and there will be social-networking with greater utility.<p>I certainly hope it is sooner rather than later.

41762,comment,41709,41709,0,0,dood,,,"News moving from print to web is a fundamental shift in the nature of the market, which brings many opportunities for growth by embracing the realities of the net, and a high chance of failure by ignoring those realities. Some thoughts:<p>The focus of the business needs to adapt to what is demanded online: giving people want they want that other sites don't give them, and conversely not providing things done better elsewhere. There is plenty of room for innovation: treating news more like data [<a href=""http://www.holovaty.com/blog/archive/2006/09/06/0307"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.holovaty.com/blog/archive/2006/09/06/0307</a>], exploiting archives, focus on analysis... In short, losing the mindset of transferring print to web, sticking to core competencies, extending and innovating where appropriate, and ditching the junk.<p>The organisation of the business may be able to move from the monolithic style to a more networked model, with more freelancing, syndication and aggregation, more 'citizen reporters' and a blurred line between bloggers and journalists.<p>The big newspapers have strong brands, and for the near future most people don't want news from some random blog, or to have to trawl the net. NYT and friends are well positioned to capture the new news business. But likely many of them will refuse to change, or try and fail. So, a period of turmoil and consolidation: many papers fold, reporters shift gears and go where the money is online, the fit adapt and survive, the weak stagnate and die. But I think all those reporters, all the net-folk wanting news, and a few savvy types to put it together, will work it out in the end one way or another. ",1186963366

What's going to happen to all of the good reporters? ...""</i><p>If you haven't noticed, front-line, serious news gatherers have been diminishing for many years. Reducing the number of first hand source gatherers. Editors & sub-editors who read stories, check titles have greater responsibilities so last minute checks on stories with clanker titles, mistakes miss out. There has been a serious decline in the variety of sources (always bad). Younger readers are shunning traditional media (tv, radio, newspapers).<p>So what's happening? Is it all bad? Well yes and no. Joe public is now the news gathers with phone, sms and web in hand. Websites who specialise in particular topics gather & pick up these stories and traditional media lag behind.  <p>The re-adjustment will occur when the new, ""<i>new</i> media"" sites are required to have greater technical, cost and professional standards. Markets will and  have been re-adjusting the traditional news structure. <p>So does traditional media disappear? <p>No, they adjust, adapt or become irrelevant. At the moment - traditional journalism (reliable source gathering, questioning the status quo, looking beyond the hype, analysing ) has been the worse for wear and we are worse off for it.

174776,comment,174107,174631,0,0,cheponis,,,"Also as an oldie, I'd say my productivity today is the highest it has ever been.  How do I keep myself motivated?  By constantly being a beginner.  I do web programming, GUI programming, embedded systems, drivers, unix, mac, PC, bare metal, lisp, python, C, dozens of assembly languages, Verilog, hardware, analog, RF, antennas, etc.<p>In my opinion, you are just making excuses for why you are less productive than you should be; it's called rationalization. ;-)<p>My advice is to dive in to some area of s/w (or whatever) that you don't know at all (i.e. become a beginner) and see if that doesn't spark your excitement again.  It does for me, over and over again!",1209285823

Use the editor's MRU list for instant access, or a shortcut(s).\nIt's a simple, superfast online\offline setup.\nIf you're not using PsPad you don't know what a top class free text editor is.",1209285023

Still, I think there is a lot of (social) value in watching TV in the sense it 'gives you something to talk about' (to say without nice words ;)",1209284715

174770,comment,174410,174541,0,0,eelco,,,"I like your last remark.  Especially because it doesn't contradict your comment as much as you think. Shirky said: ""People like to consume, but they also like to produce, and they like to share"".  He probably means to say that people like to share what they produce, but (at least) in case of TV people also like to share what they consume. Having seen the same movie/show/etc. makes us feel 'connected'. In that sense 'traditional media' actually hit two of his three points, not one.",1209284416

174767,comment,174410,174676,0,0,dejb,,,"Yes I agree it is useful to consider the rest of the world. However that was not the cause for the discrepancy and the numbers are still out by a factor of 100. If you think that 1% of global surplus attention could annually create 10000 wikipedias instead of 100 then you are likely to reach some very different conclusions. Maybe he switched context from 1% to 100% - that would make sense.",1209283697

Whereas the contemporary antidepressants affect baseline mood over a period of time, the mood-enhancing effects of marijuana will largely wear off after 3-6 hours.\n\n    3) It&#x27;s illegal to grow in the US without a license and has varying legality regarding consumption, buying, and selling throughout the world. This might not matter for some people, but it should be a strong consideration for people with families or people who work in environments with routine drug testing.

There doesn&#x27;t appear to be any commonly accepted universal truths in Lisp (otherwise we&#x27;d all be programming in some variant of it by now). However there are plenty of good ideas which many more popular languages have adopted.<p>What made it special for me was discovering the link between symbolic computing and the lambda calculus. The kernel at the center of every Lisp is a substrate upon which languages are built. <i>eval</i> knows nothing about your program but can read some Lisp forms and turn itself into a machine that can execute it. This is immensely powerful. From a shockingly small number or primitives you could build, theoretically, any language you need.<p>The more superficial qualities, for me, are a distinct lack of frivolous, obfuscating syntax; its uniformity; and its direct representation. I don&#x27;t have to maintain an exhaustive mental mapping of syntactic digraphs and operators, I don&#x27;t have to remember precedence rules, I don&#x27;t have to remember the grammatical distinctions between expressions and statements, and I certainly don&#x27;t have to maintain a running interpreter/compiler in my head. Armed with a simplified mental model of the lambda calculus such as the substitution method is enough to work out what any program is doing (and indeed due to the nature of Lisps is also easy to interactively verify).<p>Every other language I&#x27;ve worked with requires memorizing a laundry list of special cases and weird rules (ie: how array and pointer parameters are changed by the compiler in C, precedence rules as mentioned, etc) imposed for efficiency&#x27;s sake and often maligned with good engineering practices. Some strange monkey-brained part of me fools myself into believing I am becoming a better programmer when I pollute my mind with these things... but I&#x27;ve learned over the years that it&#x27;s just a trick. The ideas are important and the implementation is just the painful cost we pay to make them reality.<p>Lisp just happens to have the least cognitive load in my case.",1396622767

Yours is a dummy progress bar that gives no indication of progress and will run even if the service is doing nothing (as the &quot;we don&#x27;t support youtubes we just &#x27;upload&#x27; endlessly until you quit&quot; test proved to me).<p>Your fake progress bar and lack of error handling caused me to wait 20 minutes to upload a video for converting with zero indication that there was anything amiss. As I performed during my test, gfycat handled multiple youtubes and large gifs (1-10MB) in under 5 minutes total, while I waited 20+ minutes on Mediacrush before giving up on many of my inputs.<p>I had to contact a creator of the service to find out it didn&#x27;t support one of the most popular and most used features of the competitor he claims to be superior to!<p>I understand I&#x27;m downvoted, I understand this community is rewarding you.<p>But sorry buddy: outside of HN, Gfycat beat you with a superior service. Not because of the admins, but because users like me who willingly make the choice. Who submit links from gfycat not mediacrush. Who convert everything we see into gfycat. Because we compare services with videos, large gifs, small gifs and everything in between and pick what we like best. You didn&#x27;t convince me: quite the opposite, you attacked me for judging your service and took zero criticism fairly, even when gfycat is easily and objectively better in the eyes of the users who you have to win over to see any viral success in subreddits.

How can you compete if you&#x27;re unwilling to have fair perspective?<p>I will promote gfycat on reddit comments wildly, as I have in the past, as so many hundreds of users have loudly and strongly done so-- and thats why gfycat will succeed. Because of users like me who go into comments and convert every gif and video to gfycat and become the most upvoted comments. Gfycat succeeds because of viral attraction to it.<p>All the best luck, but you might consider adding basic error handling, upgrading your UI to meet parity with gfycat, and might want to add features like youtube if you want to compete. You can find legal reasons why you can&#x27;t, but that just means I pick gfycat over mediacrush every single time. Your legal concerns are not mine-- I want the best service, not the &quot;most proper&quot; service or whatever.

I find the copy of the ad used pretty good overall. However I&#x27;ve some consideration about it:<p>- I totally agree that Facebook must improve its tracking and must do more to prevent clicks fraud ... a problem which is still very relevant<p>- Lot&#x27;s of Facebook Ads traffic comes from mobile nowadays. This can be good or bad. If you&#x27;re promoting a website and aiming at conversions on a non mobile-friendly website you MUST disable mobile targeting.<p>- Overall $50 budget is not enough to get to any relevant conclusion.<p>- On a product like this (budgeting, finance, etc.) it&#x27;s critical to find a very good audience to target. I&#x27;d suggest using a lot custom audiences.<p>- Facebook Ads bounce rate & overall quality is very often lower than Google, Yahoo & Bing, this is implicit in the nature of the platform. On Google you&#x27;re getting traffic from people who are actively searching for a keyword strictly related to your product. On Facebook you&#x27;re targeting people based on demographic profile and a vague interest. However Facebook is very often much cheaper than Google.<p>- CPC & CTR are meaningless metrics. You should always have conversion tracking and measure the overall CPA to acquire a customer. Click frauds, wrong reportings etc. ... they exists. You cannot do anything about it. You should not give a crap about it. Just check your Cost to acquire a customer and see if it makes sense.<p>- Sometime for some markets Facebook Ads for direct conversions simply don&#x27;t work. Create valuable content like eBooks, webinars etc. to get cheaper leads and then close the sales funnel with targeted emails.<p>My 2 cents, hope it&#x27;s useful for someone :)",1396620970

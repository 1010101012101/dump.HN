My apologies if I get any of these facts wrong.]</i><p>On the first day of the 1967 conflict, based on glowing, but false, reports from the Sinai outposts, President Nasser and Egyptian military leaders thought that they had knocked out most of the Israeli air force, when in fact the opposite was true. The cascade of misinformation not only aided Israel's efforts against Egypt, but it also lead Jordan's King Hussein to commit to the conflict in the West Bank. Similarly, news of Egypt's success is thought to have emboldened Syria and lead to the battle in the Golan Heights.<p>Now, 45 years later, with the social media and other communications channels available, there is less chance that the conflict could escalate due to false information. (It could still escalate for other reasons, of course.) It's just a theory, but maybe Israel's in-your-face social media strategy is a blunt retaliation to any Baghdad Bob style reporting taking place within the Arab world. Their goal might not be to provoke the enemy, but instead to dampen any groundswell that might occur due to false reporting.",1353013067

Did this article just compare having face time with their doctor or case worker to product sales?<p>Hey, since this isn't obvious, the reason we want more time with our doctor is because our doctor knows more than we do so we don't know what sort of questions to ask, so we hope that the more time we spend there the more likely we'll remember something or he'll ask us a question to discover something. Same with everything else that is NECESSARY and has severe life consequences.<p>When I walk into a store (or virtual store) I already know what I want because I researched it before I went in. I want only 2 things from the sales staff: Where is the product and where is the end of the line for the cash register.<p>Granted, some people are ignorant or can't be bothered to research before they go buy something and will need more coddling, so there should also be services available for those people.<p>The worst thing that could happen is if you take away the option of fast customer service just because you find, on average, the consumer is happier because the service is slower.

The icon stencils are cut out at the exact size of the icons, but when you're using a stencil you often have to make the stencil larger than the icon you're trying to draw.

Also for finer detailed icons, you often can't fit a pencil into the groove of the stencil, even with the provided pencil that comes with it. The lead of the pencil is thicker than the groove in the stencil. The edges of the stencil are often quite sharp as well, and will cut the tips off of felt pens (and create grooves in pencil lead which will cause it to break).

I've been writing a Chrome extension, where the programming model is a #3 in your system  everything is async and shared-nothing  and boy do I notice the difference. Calls between two Chrome contexts are done by async message-passing using JSON, and this is like walking through mud in heavy boots compared to calling something in the same context (a normal function call). No doubt well-designed languages and libraries help to make it easier, but still. I suspect asynchronousness is responsible for more of the mental burden than shared-nothingness is (or, more precisely, serialize-everything-into-JSON-ness), but they're definitely both contributors. It's the latter that makes it impossible for me to pass a DOM element from one context to another, for example.<p>When ""passing a message"" is a heavier operation syntactically than ""calling a function"" is, one thinks of the two as being more fundamentally different than they really are. I find that interesting because it's superficial yet influential.<p>Do Erlang programmers think of function calls as a kind of message passing? or as totally different things?

I was thinking when I wrote up the comment about how VP's might feel about leaving a position that there is an interesting dividing line which doesn't get talked about a lot, Matt touches on it but didn't really call it out, its this, ""What are you trying to get done?""<p>Early in my career Steve Bourne gave me useful advice, he said the difference between junior engineers and senior engineers was that senior engineers had an agenda. More specifically they had an execution goal (like write a new file system, or create a product that solves problem 'X') and they worked toward it.<p>This is a both a hugely motivating and hugely scary thing, its motivating because you don't have to ask ""what do I do now?"" the direction just falls out of where you are vs where you are trying to go. It is scary because you can find you're goal isn't compatible with any of the company's goals. When you discover that what you want to do can't be done at the company you are working at, you either have to change goals or leave. But its not a 'feel bad about it' leaving it is 'hmm, this isn't going to work out here so lets go somewhere that it could'.<p>The alternative to having an agenda is ""Goofing off and waiting for someone to give you a task."" There are a lot of engineers who operate in that mode, do their assigned tasks at an acceptable quality level and without too much schedule slip. They are great to have around because people with agendas and use them to move the agenda forward, but they don't make for very good 'senior' people because they really don't care what they work on, its not their main focus.<p>It is important to note that you can't ""fail"" if you're just goofing off, as one of my kids put it, ""It isn't procrastination if you don't have anything you need to do."" You can however rationalize your low work output by the fact that your management really hasn't given you all that much to do, so whose fault is that? Whereas if you have an agenda, a goal, a destination, you can fail to make it to that destination. ""You said you were going to build a game that could crush Farmville, you failed."" Reading the blog post from Speck about Glitch shutting down, ""we failed to develop an audience."" They had a goal, they didn't get there.<p>Matt's advice that if you don't know what you want, you can't choose reasonably is solid. Start by deciding what you want to do, and pick something that will take a while as early goal achievement has its own problems.",1353010971

In another recent thread there was a MS research paper about ""ill-conceived"" Hadoop clusters processing 14GB of data...<p>The main benefits I see are:<p>1) You don't have to write in a specialized language.  You should be able to use <i>any</i> language with a good implementation.  Scientific code often has Matlab, R, C++, and Python glued together.<p>2) MapReduce lets you write sequential code, which is easier to learn.<p>3) You can adapt/port sequential legacy code easily, so you can use a lot of your existing code.<p>MapReduce is of course similar to ""parallel for"" but more powerful -- parallel for is essentially the map stage.  The reduce stage adds a lot.  For some reason most people who haven't programmed MapReduce think of MapReduce as just mapping, and they don't understand reducing.<p>If you want to do it quick and dirty, don't underestimate ""xargs -P"" :)  That's your ""parallel for"" that works with any language.  You can run that on your Matlab, Python, C++, etc.  You need a serialization library but there are a lot of those around.  It works well and with a minimum of programming effort.",1353010696

Then again, I'm also a rule follower who would enjoy living in Scandanavia in communities with a strong social conscience, even though it does lead to ""lowest common denominator"" solutions to problems it faces.  In Scandanavia, the lowest common denominator isn't far below the mean, since the society is so homogenous.  In the USA, the standard deviation is much greater.<p>In the end, though, those little petri dish cultures are not where the action is in the world.

You only get a second rate developer when you settle for one.<p>The problem is that ONLY considering local and soon-to-be-local developers  makes things more difficult for your company to hire. Maybe the developers in your region are happy with their jobs, or they don't have the particular skillset that you need.<p>Relocating devs are just as hard, since you are competing with other companies that are also willing to spend lavishly on developer relocation and salary. Plus the developer has to weigh in the cost of upending their lives to be near your company. This is thousands of dollars of investment before they even walk in the door, even for a young single 20 something developer, and family members will only multiply that number.<p>Remote work is an enormously untapped resource that it's silly not to seriously consider it. Not only will you open yourself up to entire populations of developers, but you might even get a better deal salary and benefits wise if you allow them to live where they want. $80k goes much further in other parts of the country than in the Bay or NY, giving you a competitive advantage both in attracting devs and keeping them happy. Think how much you can save on office space if everybody already works from their own home offices?<p>Of course, there is the persistant fear of keeping devs working, but you should be giving any new dev (and old, for that matter) a set of goals and expectations to be met. However this isn't any different than a local employee in your office anyway. If a new dev doesn't work out, then fire him an move to another more qualified candidate. The most you will be out is the salary during the prohibitionary period.<p>Remote work isn't as scary as it seems if both parties understand the expectations and prepare themselves accordingly.",1353010586

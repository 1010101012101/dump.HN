I.e. what you type goes through autocomplete or an IME before being sent to the application you type into. It eases the need to switch to a different keyboard altogether just to input emoji, you just type &quot;heart&quot; and choose from the candidates.<p>That&#x27;s a reason it is so heavily used in Japan, where they already have a two layer input system anyway. We might also have it easier and easier in ascii based languages as autocomplete like features develop and become ubiquitous.",1404860300

The law school boom isn&#x27;t over.<p>I have a J.D. from Stanford (though I spend my time investing and working on my own projects), and though the legal education industry is in many respects quite hidebound and deserving of a downward correction, there is one swift wind filling the sails.<p>It&#x27;s what Milovan Djilas[1] called &quot;the new class.&quot; Djilas was a Yugoslav Soviet dissident. For a brief instant he was a true believer. But Djilas saw by 1954 that a large government tasked with redistribution was giving rise to a new elite: the redistributors. He wrote articles about &quot;the new class&quot; and was kicked out of the Party.<p>A friend of mine, a law professor in Knoxville, wrote about this in USA Today yesterday:<p>&quot;Here in the United States, a lot of programs officially     aimed at the poor look suspiciously like subsidies to the New Class, too. Among &quot;means-tested&quot; programs, Food Stamps, now officially called SNAP, cover about 46 million people up to 125% of the poverty line (set at about $16,000 for a single mother and child). Other programs, such as the Earned Income Tax credit, cover people at slightly higher incomes, up to 200% of the poverty line. When federal spending on the dozens of programs are added up and state and local contributions included, the budget for assistance is about $1 trillion.<p>&quot;If we simply handed those people, perhaps 60 million of them, their share of the cash, that would be more than $16,500 each. A single mom and her baby would get over $33,000, twice as much as a poverty wage. A family of four would land more than $66,000, $15,000 more than the average family income.<p>&quot;So where&#x27;s the money going? To people who aren&#x27;t poor, such as doctors paid through Medicaid or landlords paid through Section 8. And to tens of thousands of members of the New Class, people like social workers, administrators and lawyers who run more than 120 different means tested federal programs.&quot;[2]<p>And law school is the gate to a federal job. That&#x27;s a powerful <i>expansionary</i> force supporting legal education.<p>Also, a Maserati dealer has just opened in Arlington, Virginia.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milovan_%C4%90ilas#Dissident"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milovan_%C4%90ilas#Dissident</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/07/07/regulations-class-wealth-income-inequality-opportunity-reynolds-column/12266651/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/07/07/regulations...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.arlnow.com/2014/07/07/maserati-of-arlington-now-open/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arlnow.com/2014/07/07/maserati-of-arlington-now-o...</a>",1404859411

It is just as likely that without that option, the code would have just checked for a value, or thrown an error. So... what changed?<p>What changed is that you are unable to propagate a null-that-shouldn&#x27;t-be-null value to the rest of the program.<p>If you have a value V that might be null, and you are supposed to return that value itself (not wrapped in an Option or anything like that, ie a &#x27;nullable type&#x27;), all you can really do is: actually return a value of type V, or throw an exception. That&#x27;s it! (To throw an exception is also something that can be done at any time in most statically typed languages, for any reason whatsoever. Throwing exceptions is usually not a question of the type correctness of a program (maybe it is in the case of checked exceptions?).) You can <i>not</i> give null as an output: you are supposed to give V as the output, not a nullable V. So you know <i>exactly</i> where in your program you are doing something &#x27;unsafely&#x27;, i.e. where you are not rigorously handling every case of the value of some type. Though &#x27;unsafe&#x27; is a bit misleading, since you may very well intend to just throw an exception in the (perhaps deliberately possible) case that a value is null.",1404858928

This turned out to be a catastrophic mistake, as it came at the peak of the bubble in law school enrolment. There had never been such a gap between the number of students and the number of legal jobs.<p>Articles starting appearing circa 2010 that described a nightmare of $160,000 debt and no legal job. As students began to realize the world had changed, the decline began.<p>Parents are a big part of the problem. The boomers largely haven&#x27;t caught on that a BA and a JD are no longer the good choices they were back in the 1960s and 1970s.<p>I&#x27;m in LSAT prep and I talk to a lot of pre-law applicants. They&#x27;re now generally far more aware of what&#x27;s at stake. But I only talk to the ones who are good at planning – I expect there&#x27;s a decent amount of students who go into law school without realizing it can ruin their life.<p>Here on HN, we&#x27;re in a bubble. Recruiters are a constant complaint. &quot;Ugh, I hate all these people trying to offer me well-paying jobs&quot;.<p>Consider what&#x27;s it&#x27;s like to be 26 years old, with a BA and now a JD. You have about $160,000 that cannot be removed through bankruptcy. You have no assets and no marketable skills. You can&#x27;t get a legal job, for structural reasons. And non-legal employers now give you a wide berth because you&#x27;re overqualified.<p>Worse, you did everything you were &quot;supposed&quot; to do. Turns out it was cargo cult advice.<p>That&#x27;s the situations thousands of young people find themselves in. Even going for one year and quitting can be crippling. You get $40,000 of non-dischargeable debt for your troubles.<p>If you happen to be giving career advice, here are the circumstances under which you should go to law school:<p><pre><code>  1. You have a burning passion to be a lawyer. \n  2. Said passion is based on actual knowledge of what lawyers do.\n  3. You can get into a T14 school, OR\n  4. You can get into a T100 school with a full scholarship, OR\n  5. You can get into a school very well regarded in the local area where you want to practice, OR\n  6. You have a legal job more or less in the bag upon graduation, through family, OR\n  7. You are rich and want to be a lawyer for what prestige it still carries\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s about it. It&#x27;s a terrible, terrible choice for anyone else.<p>We need lawyers, and at some point the legal education market will sort itself out I&#x27;m sure.

Rather, I tend to think they would have just been replaced with similar bugs.<p>This reads to me like eliminating null pointer bugs would just create a void that something else would fill? I don&#x27;t see how that would work, at all. Is eliminating a null pointer exception going to introduce a divide by zero exception/bug? Is it going to introduce program logic bug? ...<p>If you&#x27;re thinking about unwrapping a nullable value and throwing an exception if it really is null; I don&#x27;t think of that as a conceptual null pointer exception, at least not in the usual sense. It&#x27;s a deliberate decision along the lines of &quot;I know [because of the control flow up to this point] that this value can not be null&quot; or &quot;if it is null, just throw an exception&quot;. It is NOT &quot;this value can never be null... I think... well let&#x27;s check the documentation, OK I&#x27;ll assume that it isn&#x27;t being misleading (documentation can easily &#x27;lie&#x27; about a value being null in a nullable-by-default language, since non-nullable is not expressible in the language).<p>In a language with nullable-always, you can <i>always</i> pass a value (probably reference, but still) as null. In a language with explicitly nullable types, <i>this is impossible</i>. That&#x27;s why unwrap functions throw an exception if the value is null: there is <i>no other way</i> to handle that case in a typed manner (well, I guess you also could loop forever...). In a nullable-by-default language? It is always fine to pass null. And it will not necessarily fail if a null is passed that shouldn&#x27;t have been passed: it will only error when the reference is (tried to be) dereferenced.",1404857363

I basically got a lot of college data from the IPEDS database and made a form so users can submit their SAT score and figure out which schools to apply to. Safety schools are those that you have a great shot of getting into, Match schools are those where you fit the median profile, and Reach schools are that you have a lower chance of getting into.<p>I thought it&#x27;d be useful for kids who want to explore schools to apply to for college. The app is very barebones, but I had a lot of fun dipping my toes in web dev and learning some new technologies. If people like it I&#x27;ll work on adding more features like entering your zip code/GPA to get a much better admissions profile. Admission at most colleges is based on your transcript and scores, and most kids stay in-state, so both of those would be pretty useful data points.<p>I&#x27;d love any feedback!",1404856989

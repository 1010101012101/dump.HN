29329,comment,29301,29312,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It is trivially easy to start your own hedge fund.  I've got a friend from college that's done it, and obviously my employer's customers have all done it (I work for a financial software startup).  All you have to do is file for a LLC - it costs like $45.<p>The tricky part is a.) finding investors to give you money and b.) investing that money well.  Your limited partners have to be ""accredited investors"", which means they need income of over $200K for the last 2 years or a net worth over $1M.  Obviously, it takes a fair amount of persuasion to convince someone to fork over a million dollars.  But if you've got a Ph.D in physics or successful experience on Wall Street, it's not all that hard.",1182293527

The amount of commands that you really use in day to day development is very, very small however. I haven't tried Mercurial myself but a friend of mine uses it. There's also monotone to try out.

29321,comment,29301,29312,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"You can use your models to trade your own funds (that's what Simons -- the guy behind Renaissance -- did), but it's probably not worth it. Imagine that you're good enough to beat the market by 500 basis points: you earn 15% per year when the market does 10. Investing your own retirement funds, and starting at 100K, you'll end up just about doubling your money in five years.<p>Hedge funds typically charge 20% of profits and 2% of assets. Let's say you spend your $100K paying a lawyer to incorporate you, and you take a year off to raise your first $5 million. Over the next four years, your earnings would start at $250K for year two, and hit $332K by year five. Even accounting for the missed year, the earnings from starting a hedge fund would be an order of magnitude higher than those from running your own money.<p>This is obviously simplified (I'm ignoring taxes and inflation, which if nothing else will get me dirty looks from my fellow libertarians), but it should illustrate why so many PhDs are getting rich running money for second-generation MBAs.",1182292222

Probably not, as they really need that app one way or another for the suite.  Excellent recovery that Zenter got bought instead of ending up on ebay.<p>Also congratulations to the Y Combinator team - yet another good call added to the record.  The PR from this will be big.",1182291887

29315,comment,29301,29304,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"(Full disclosure: I'm a recruiter for hedge funds -- including Renaissance):<p>One of the points PG makes in his essays is that it's absurdly cheap (in terms of capital required) to start a startup: if you have a computer and an Internet connection, it's not much more expensive than doing nothing at all. This changes your risk perception: startups can afford to hire unusual developers doing obscure stuff, because someone with a 10% chance of utterly destroying the business is just going to change your odds of failure from 90% to 91%.<p>Hedge funds and i-banks don't have that sort of equation: they're brutally competitive (you can start a new service and hope that Google doesn't know about it until you're too big not to be bought -- but if you start trading an obscure derivative, <i>everyone</i> is going to find out about it) and they tend to be risking millions of dollars of other peoples' money. So they're crazily cautious, which shows up in their hiring practices: one company I work with brags about rejecting all but one in five hundred candidates (yes. Their acceptance rate is less than MIT-squared), while another requires a BS/MS/PhD with a minimum GPA of 3.7 to be considered for an entry-level job. To attract people, they offer the ridiculous salaries you pointed out -- but there's an equilibrium between the absurd compensation and the absurd lengths you'd have to go to earn it.<p>If you want to talk to some quants, try: <a href=""http://www.nuclearphynance.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nuclearphynance.com/</a>",1182291619

Do you just individually do whatever suits you, or do you discuss what's most important for the company and make decisions together? <p>Same goes for a marriage. It's a partnership - all decisions are cooperative. All major decisions (should) be by consensus. (flame edited out by author).

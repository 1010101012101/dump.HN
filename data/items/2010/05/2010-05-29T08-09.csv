A simple list of known good, and known bad addresses to use as test cases would really help.<p>You could almost make a game out of finding valid addresses that are not matched, or invalid addresses that are false positives, or optimizing candidate regexps. The list could be continuously growing as new variations are discovered, and tested against previously submitted candidate regexps.",1275123445

The key element to FarmVille (and games like WoW) is -- you level up not due to skill, but by how long you play the game. In other words, a very skilled player will level up just as quickly as an unskilled one.<p>On HN, karma is earned much more rapidly by ""skilled"" users, even though to get a high karma you must use the site often. Taking this away would rob HN of its most valuable asset -- karma encourages ""skilled"" users to post insightful comments.",1275123258

I just switched from an old Centro phone to Palm Pre, and noticed how problematic those pretty buttonless interfaces are : you simply can't use the phone at all without watching at it. I could grab my centro, reply on the phone, hang up, call back, call my wife, or office, without a single glance at it. It's impossible with a pure touchscreen device, and that's the single worst problem I have with it. A usability problem.",1275121572

You do not need a forge hosting like Indefero or Github or you name it, to use it.<p>What I really like for example, is that I can pull a project from anywhere, be stuck on a local network with other developers, work on the code with branch/commit/pull in all the directions and then later, push back the results without the fear of losing something in the merge.<p>Git is great and more of it cannot hurt.",1275121068

Instead, the software community reacted by putting in place safeguards and frameworks and processes.</i><p>This misses the point. The fundamental fact of the software industry is that the demand for software exceeds the supply of good programmers by about an order of magnitude. Many of the irrational properties of the industry can be deduced from that.",1275120903
1388516,comment,1388336,1388432,0,0,devinj,,,"Disclaimers are for avoiding liability. i.e. you adda  disclaimer because you have some hidden agenda or other fact that hurts your cause. Caring about usability on the web isn't any of these things. It's really more of a ""and it's not like I dislike usability, either,"" sort of addendum rather than a disclaimer.<p>Anyway, I'm not convinced. Usability matters to everyone, not just people that can't make heads or tails of the interface. The point is not only to make it usable at all, but also to make it easier to use, and at times, faster to use. So, sure, maybe a ferrari isn't usable by those that are somehow physically handicapped and unable to walk. But you know what? That doesn't have to be the case, and indisputably the ferrari would be better if it was usable by everyone without sacrificing anything (except the ""freedom"" of the engineer to make it hard to use for some people). And that's what usability, and accessibility, is about, isn't it?",1275120642

Not many robots. I suspect the next 300 years will change that ratio hugely.

When AT&T was a monopoly, they provided exactly the kind of unprofitable environment that geeks love (and they had the spare cash for them to buy toys, too!).  Think of the programming languages you could have developed!<p>Google has some of its spirit and has hired some of their best, but I don't think anything today is the same <i>sigh</i><p>I believe in their hearts of hearts geeks would prefer a Bell Labs environment over a startup any day.  The kids who are starting web-based companies are only entrepreneurs due to the misfortune of not having such opportunities.<p>",1175136523

7166,comment,6668,6668,0,0,jackpipe,,,"To the JumpBox guy.\nInteresting idea.\nYou need to come right out with what you're doing, on the home page, or in the first sentence of the 'about' page.  I don't want to read a paragraph of crap about automobiles, before coming to what you're all about.\nAlso, I'm sure LAMP components (ie the various tiers of web server) would be a hit - ie seperate VM images for apache, database, etc.",1175136260

7162,comment,6668,6668,0,0,jackpipe,,,"Well, you state that 0% of your startups had a bad experience.  But of course these were the ones that got funding - they are already winners, even if they later failed to make it big.\nWhat about the 400-odd that didn't get funding?  It takes much more than a couple of weekends in a cafe to put together a decent startup proposal, often the startups have made considerable sacrifice, not to mention putting their hopes and dreams on the line, even to get face time with potential investors.\n",1175135228

Woman will pick who she finds attractive, not someone who outbids the other guy.<p>PS: Feminists will be all over this one.. I can just see it: ""you mean, you're bidding on women?!""",1175134604

7156,comment,7136,7136,0,0,AurSaraf,,,"Hello. I am Aur Saraf.<p>And I don't like this.<p>Why?<p>Because flirting is about communication. Perhaps it's the journalist's mistake, but it seems like communication plays secondary role here to a currency based trading system.<p>Is that a way to show value? ""I answered more questions and logged in more, and I believe I'll win your heart, so here, I'm bidding 25 points on you, sweetie""? Even MORE competition? How objectified can a poor sweet lovely girl BE?<p>No.<p>I really don't think so.<p>I agree, dating sites suck. They are a badly implemented meat market.<p>I just think this amplifies the problems instead of fixing them.<p>The good dating site still isn't public.<p>We'll have to wait.<p><p>BTW an invite to prove me wring would be appreciated.<p>Aur",1175133792

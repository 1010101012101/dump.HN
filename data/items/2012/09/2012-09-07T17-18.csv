4490347,comment,4488561,4488561,1,0,dgunn,,,"I'm not sure how submissions like this are still showing up so commonly or how they arrive at the top of the list. If ever there was a community of people capable of solving the problem of ""improving HN"", this is the one. I supply a problem statement and solution below.<p>Problem:
HN has problems which seem not to get fixed despite recommendations made to the maintainer(s?). Why? I suspect it's because maintaining HN is one of the lowest priority jobs to the maintainer of HN. The guy is busy! Fixing problems or implementing possible features quickly would have very low ROI to such a person. This isn't to say that he(they?) doesn't care - just doesn't have time because his other responsibilities are <i>actual</i> responsibilities, not a hobby. This is the equivalent of hiring an independently wealthy person to work for your company. The person may really like working for you, but you can't rely on them. They have little incentive to stick around if they get even slightly bored.<p>Solution:
Make a new one. Someone make something better. You know where your primary audience lives (here) so you know where to find users. Monetize it in some way so that I know you'll keep working on it. Make it your full time gig. With the number of users you could get, you wouldn't have to ask for much. A donation model would probably pay you a pretty good salary. Be nice to the community and make reasonable attempts to fix the issues they bring up. They'll probably even help you fix them if you need them to.",1347040787

This is the most similar part to the UK's copyrights in that it's about property and it expires when the work falls into the public domain.<p>Then there's the moral right, which is about the authorship relation: the work is found to be part of the author, and the other way around.

C takes longer to write than eg Python--I don't care who you are, it does. And if you're the god programmer of C, you probably cost a lot.<p>That's not what experiments have borne out, time-to-develop generally has a lot more to do with proficiency in the language of choice and in the problem domain than the language itself.

It's patronizing, insulting, and it badly mischaracterizes efforts like the one that kicked off this thread.<p>I see it like this: lack of diversity is a bug on our community. I'd like to fix it, so I work on fixing these bugs. Right now, the information I have available tells me that gender diversity is the worst of the bugs under the ""diversity"" label, and it's also one I think I have the skills to tackle. This doesn't mean that other bugs are less important, or less worth solving. I happen to believe that this bug is the one that's most worth my time to tackle.<p>Yes, I <i>do</i> see lack of diversity -- in all forms -- as an issue in our community. There are other minorities besides women that're systematically discouraged from entering tech; we should do something about that. Hopefully our fix for the gender bugs can be abstracted and applied in other areas.",1347040634

Hi-dpi screens are a benchmark feature that made me a heavy mobile device user. Web browsing on a phone was not very appealing, and then comes the ""Retina"" display on the iPhone 4, and bam, I'm an Apple customer.<p>I got an iPad 1 as a gift, and I ended up using it for reading a lot more than I expected, which just had me itching for the day a ""Retina"" display landed in an iPad. Got the iPad 3 recently and love it to bits, much more for that screen quality than anything in the iOS ecosystem.<p>Hi-dpi is what finally killed print media fully for me. I have no use for print books or magazines. I have an old-ish Kindle e-ink reader and the iPad 3, and the two of them combined weigh less than a single hearty book in my book bag. I look forward to the day when people unwilling or unable to pay the Apple premium for devices can enjoy the same screen quality.

You can run simulations that accurately reflect the real world using one set of variables, then run another model (or somehow test another model) that confirms the original simulation's results from a different perspective; ie, you have two theories, and you validate the second by proving its equivalent to the first, even though it uses a different set of variables, or looks at it using a different theoretical framework.<p>of course, you're right that this can be troublesome. just because you can validate a theory as accurately modeling reality doesn't mean that the components of the model are true or useful.<p>and necessarily, the first 'computational model' would have needed to be already validated before something else might be validated against it...in case that wasn't clear.",1347040457

One of the form factors touted around for the iPad mini is the 8.9 inch form factor. No one expects the iPad mini to be the same price as the iPad 3. So that $200 difference may be a temporary advantage.<p>2. The iPad/iPhone app store has been around since 2008. Folks who have purchased an iPhone and an iPad may have sunk substantial money into buying apps. That ""sunk cost"" is just another hurdle any other tablet maker is going to have to beat.<p>3. People talk about how Amazon and Google are ""giving away the razor and selling razor blades"" and Apple is in the hardware business. That's quite simply BS. Apple gets 30% of the gross from the App store, including in-app purchases. Those 99 cent Angry Birds downloads add up. The app store may not have been a big profit center in 2009, but we're not in 2009 anymore.<p>4.

Women make up roughly 20% of the workforce in technical professions, but only about 2% of open source developers.

It suggests that a simple form of contract between two consenting counterparties should be made unlawful, and then, to get around the fact that this would result in a market where small startups would never be able to get merchant accounts, suggests that the entire payment processing market would either restructure itself or be forced to restructure itself to get around that problem.<p>No. That's not going to happen. I'll go one further: if you so much as sign your name on a contract the wrong way, for instance by leaving out your title, you can <i>easily</i> create situations in which contracts that individual officers of your company sign bind <i>directly to them</i>; for instance, your VP/Engineering could easily sign a contract with a consulting developer that would leave them <i>personally liable</i> to that consultant if the company went out of business and didn't pay the consultant. The VP/Engineering in that scenario didn't even intend to create a personal attachment, and yet cases like this have been decided against people like that.<p>Similarly, in some states, payroll obligations --- which are contractual, precisely the type of exposure that limited liability covers --- can automatically pierce corporate liability and bind to the owners of the company.<p>I think you drastically overestimate the protection afforded by limited liability.",1347038561

Another contender here is the economist, which is one of the very, very few journalistic products that makes money with a pay wall. The reason, again, being that they offer very high quality.<p>I would also pay for an online newspaper that lacks advertisement and employs really good journalists to paint a picture that is as close to the truth as possible. The less ties between a newspaper and any industry, the less the chance that a story is pulled because the company in question places lots of advertisement in the newspaper.<p>It's true that most people wouldn't want to pay for a community, many people on Twitter only use it to read what celebrities are up to. However, I don't think that a social network needs to be as big as Facebook anymore to be successful - or Twitter, or Instagram. As long as there's a vibrant community, that is dedicated to the service, and solid growth, everything is fine.<p>Especially since Facebook (at least for me) already satisfies the 'friends' kind of social network. I have all my contacts there, so for engaging with them, I go to Facebook, I don't need another service. If I join another service, then because the value proposition is not about friends, but about something different. Badoo is a success because their value proposition is about dating, and Twitter is a success because they offer many-to-many friendships and open celebrities. Again, Instagram was a success because they changed the mapping, instead of friends -> content they went for content -> friends.<p>As long as a network doesn't compete with Facebook on their core values, i guess they're fine.<p>On Twitter, I don't care if there're 10Million or 100Million other users, I can only see so many. So as long as there're <i>enough</i> users on ADN I'd guess that I'm happy there.<p>Oh, I'm also just trying to explain what I think about where this is going, I'm not trying to defend anything, sorry if it sounds like that :)<p>Thanks, Appetizer is in many ways a side project right now, but it's fun working on it. Also, while we're at it, I like the OpenPhoto approach, I really want to install it once I find some time. Had it on my todo list for months now. I'm unhappy with most current online photo solutions, and having them on my own server sounds just about right. I wish you best of luck there :)",1347037200

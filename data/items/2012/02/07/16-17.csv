They're not fat at all but they are approaching the weight of two average people, easy.<p>What really astounds me, though, are skinny girls going away for three days but check-in TONS of luggage. It also is invariably over the weight limit and they end up paying excess.<p>Guys, on the other hand, take a tiny little rucksack on as hand luggage containing a clean shirt, a clean pair of kecks and their toothbrush for the same trip.

We have web forms, ASP.Net MVC, and all three view engines in play. Our builds and releases are highly automated, mostly done on a one week schedule but we do release as needed.

3562528,comment,3561397,3561397,9,0,coffeeaddicted,,,"Slightly similar lesson I learned when developing games (and other 3d apps). Make sure your debug-output is so good that you don't have to start the debugger before you already have an idea what's going on. Simple stuff like - your 2d and 3d cursor positions can be printed on screen always. You can add lines and polygons which are visible for debugging in your code with a single line (and you only comment them out afterward and don't remove them as you will need them again). When developing things like A* - make sure you can print every value on screen easily. Adding all those kind of easy debug-outputs is usually worth it over and over again and still it often only gets added to a project after people get stuck on the algorithms for too long. So right problem in 3D-development: debug output first.",1328633607

He never really got it off the ground, but I only mention it to say that my ideas below aren't new.<p>I see Agile teams as having (say) three steps towards maturity. Something like:<p><pre><code>  1. Agile Adoption: adopts some agile practices, strictly by the book. \n</code></pre>\nSometimes this turns out well, sometimes this just turns into scrumfall projects. Sometimes this is taken because of top-down demand for some reason (""Must build sustainable engineering department."" or ""Must hire rockstars, but they all get cold feet when we describe a typical day at this office full of fire-fighting""). Sometimes this is taken on because a manager read a report about agile teams being more efficient, so let's throw agile practices into the mix and maybe get an extra 20% productivity out of the engineers we have, because Agile is so efficient! (""It's magically efficient!""). Sometimes this is undertaken by bright-eyed, grass-roots engineers who don't know they don't have a prayer.<p>Sometimes this stage is filled with people doing numerology and trying to figure out industry standard story points per programmer or something equally stupid.<p><pre><code>  2. ""Communication goes both ways""\n</code></pre>\nClients listen when programmers say something can't be done, or at least look at velocity and use that as a basis when planning. Kanban may work well at this maturity level, and horribly fail at the agile adoption level - the client listens when you say, ""you've filled the development swim lane lane with 8 units of work, you can't add any more at this time"")<p><pre><code>  3. ""Agile Zen Master""\n</code></pre>\nEveryone involved is mature adults. The need for process disappears because something lightweight really works, and all team members are valued. There's something lightweight to manage the development workflow: Be that a Kanban board, smoke signals, whatever. Some procedures remain, but only those that really work for the team.<p>Of course, this maturity model falls into the ""Brooke's Trap"" (where every project thinks they're immune from Brooke's Law), but there was talk about how to overcome this in the maturity model.<p>To me, this entry targets the third type of mature project, or encourages movement from second to third. Which is good, but you also don't demand a kindergartener paint the Mona Lisa or do Calculus either - there needs to be understanding in the Agile community that there's organizational growth required sometimes before abandoning processes because they aren't explicitly mentioned in the Manifesto.",1328633023

Then it takes the NVIDIA server and copies the images over to the slower card.  In a round about way it's what windows systems do for it, but not quite as sane and not quite as performant.  There's been some work to create the sharing needed so that drivers can share the buffers directly and eventually there won't need to be the second X server.

3562255,comment,3561933,3561933,10,0,michaelochurch,,,"Seems naive. I came up with an engineering scale that I think is pretty solid, at least over the 0.5 to 2.2 range. <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajectory-of-a-software-engineer-and-where-it-all-goes-wrong/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajector...</a> . I'm only about 1.7 so beyond about 2.2 I had to start using ""bigger and badder"" type definitions because I could only delineate those levels based on visible accomplishments, not experience or observation. Also, it's more of an ""liberal arts"" <i>engineering</i> (adding value to organizations) than one focused on domain-specific <i>programming</i> capabilities, which are still important but much harder to measure. You can become a 2.0 <i>engineer</i> in artificial intelligence, or in front-end web development, or in embedded device development and the processes of getting there are rather similar. Being a ""good programmer"" in each discipline is different.<p>What OP's system describes is the progress from a novice (0.5) to a competent adder (1.0) to a general-purpose multiplier (2.0). Most serious programmers are between 1.0 and 2.0, so the growth process is about becoming a multiplier. At 1.1, you start automating annoying tasks by writing scripts. At 1.4, you're starting to become aware of the need for language-level support for code reuse and complexity management, so functional programming becomes attractive. The 1.5-1.7 range is when Lisp's language-oriented features (macros) start to shine. Most 2.0 programmers are cautious about when they use such things, though. Yes, DSLs can be very powerful; they can also be unmaintainable, miserable cruft-piles. Being a great (2.0+) programmer is about adding the most value though team- or company-wide multiplier effects, <i>not</i> being clever. Often, you add the most value by designing systems so simple and elegant that they almost insult the user's intelligence (in a good way).<p>Functional programming is a shibboleth of good (1.5+) engineers because it's usually what they first learn as they break through the 1.2 ceiling observed in Javaland (since Java and enterprise programming actively work to prevent people from having multiplier effects). And pretty much every 1.5+ programmer knows what functional programming is and what its rules are (and when to break them). That said, it's not a strict rule that to reach or surpass 1.4-1.5 you have to spend X amount of time using functional languages.",1328630473

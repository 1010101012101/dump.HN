They certainly do help their investments to do well, but I don't think they would keep from funding a similar company if they think it will increase their potential return.<p>After all, they expect a good deal of their companies to fail. If they didn't fail because of the idea then doubling up through a similar company is a good way to increase their odds. They might not fund competitors in the same cycle though.",1203645571

120972,comment,120843,120914,0,0,webwright,,,"I'm curious what you'd be doing for 40-60 hours a week while your partner(s) hack.  I'm not being snippy.  In fact, I am the least technical of 3 hackers on our team (currently YC08).  I do all of the Photoshop work, html, css, JavaScript, light Rails, customer communication, copywriting, analytics, cooking (I'm serious), pitching, etc.<p>But if I took out the BUILDING stuff (design prototyping and front-end development), I wouldn't be a critical asset to the first 3-6 months of product development.  I could certainly keep myself busy, but I wouldn't be critical.<p>If I were in your shoes, I'd focus on pitching why you are critical.  Having ideas and being a user in your target market doesn't cut the mustard IMO.  And an early stage team doesn't need a project manager, or detailed spec sheets, or other ""manager-y"" stuff.<p>That being said, there are startups that could really benefit from early sales/biz dev efforts.  I know of at least one YC08 company that has a founder who is selling the hell out of their offering already (for real dollars).  THAT has real value, but it really only applies to certain startups (a UGC site like I think you're after isn't one of 'em).",1203645545

And so, facebook, being the largest 2.0 social network becomes a cornerstone of the next generation of social apps.<p>I see it like the free-rider problem:  facebook is like roads or plumbing or some other infrastructure, everybody profits from having one central established social network, but the reason it is in that position is because it's free.  The hard part is just like paying for roads - you have to find a way of getting people to pay for it without diminishing its appeal",1203645237

I have not used too many of the specific languages or techniques in my professional life however as that tends to more or less keep up with the industry.<p>The most important things I gleaned from my graduate work about 10 years later (MBA and some more applied math) were how to present interesting data to people in a way that they too could interpret it and derive value from it, and how to manage social networks effectively.",1203644198

This is an email that I sent to Bruce Schneier last month:<p>In your November article on laptop security, you mentioned the threat of having your laptop grabbed out of hands while you're typing on it.  Combined with full-disk encryption, I use a very simple and effective defense against this: configure the system to immediately lock the screen on transitions from A/C power to battery.  That way, the\nthief can't take your data any further than the length of the power cord.<p>It's not completely fool-proof, of course: as long as the encryption key is stored in RAM, it's theoretically possible to extract it, e.g., by transfering the DIMM to special hardware while keeping it powered.  But I've never heard of anyone actually accomplishing this, and it's certainly beyond the ken of your average identity thief and\npossibly even the FBI.<p>I use Linux exclusively, and there implementing this is a simple matter of adding a hook into your acpid scripts.  I'm not certain whether there's any easy way to do it in Windows or Mac.<p>One more thought in a similar vein: a lot of modern laptops include accelerometers so that they can make the hard drive protect itself if they detect that they're being dropped.

120933,comment,120857,120923,0,0,thorax,,,"To touch on your ""web gui code"" comment-- I think that may be marginalizing people a little bit.<p>Hackers <i>can</i> do web GUI code. Nowadays they pretty much have to do so, because it's often the ideal front-end for whatever backend software you produce.<p>Computer-oriented businesses that build up a long-term business advantage are going to start with some solid technology behind them that is difficult to reproduce without knowledge. For example, new search engine technologies, new streaming codecs, new AI prediction routines, etc, etc.<p>For a less grand example, our site, <a href=""http://bug.gd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bug.gd</a> is pretty simple from a web design point of view, but I learned from my CS courses that full-text indexing isn't something to take lightly in large quantities. So I know enough to search out tools (like sphinx or lucene) that implement algorithms I can literally understand to be reliable, fast, and memory efficient.<p>The CS schooling also allows us to write more client software for different OS's that help catch and report error conditions into the global error database. We'd be stuck with <i>only</i> a web frontend if we didn't have people with good CS/os backgrounds to work on lower-level API to catch what we need there.<p>Secure coding is another area in which core computer science compentencies are worth every penny.<p>Anyway, sorry to ramble, but I think your question comes from a perspective of misunderstanding just how many zillions of doors open to a computer scientist that are harder/closed/lost/hopeless for those who don't dive into the technology. It's not all lost on web GUI development.<p>Not that other hackers (non-CS) couldn't do the things I described, but I know those tools come in incredibly handy for me in trying to help shape this computer-heavy world.",1203643246

If people are going to make YC clones, why don't they do it in the Valley?  There's a large enough market here, that I think it could handle 4 or 5 YC clones and still not saturate the market. The only competition that YC has in the early, early stage funding market are angel investors and credit card companies/savings accounts.  Charles River Ventures program doesn't really count because it's a loan with strings attached based on Series A funding.<p>Granted, there's a lot more angel capital floating around in the Valley, but you have to be here, and know people before you can have access to Angel funding.   It's hard for people hoping to move here and start a business right away.   That's one of the things that YC has going for it.  It attracts applicants from all over because of PG's writings and this here site, and it helps them hit the ground running.<p>Paul and Jessica are always saying how they regret that they have to turn down so many great groups of founders.  They get roughly 600 applications per round, and they are only able to fund 10-20 every 6 months. If another YC clone came around, and tried to sort through the 580 applicants left out of each batch, I still think that they'd probably do pretty well.<p>And, if it was based here, they could run groups twice a year here in the Valley and they wouldn't have to be Bi-Coastal.

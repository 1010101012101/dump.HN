The third class I said there didn't seem to be much point in my being there, did he mind if I just handed in the homework?<p>A few weeks later when I walked into another course I was taking with a lot of the same people a lot of them started congratulating me.  I was puzzled.  They explained that one had asked whether I was dropping the class since I hadn't been going and so they heard that I was actually taking the final exam that day.<p>I did the follow-up course the following month. :-)<p>Another time I taught my brother the basics of differential calculus in about half an hour or so.

All four can be used to to Kindle like things. All four are getting better at doing Kindle like things. All four have the potential to introduce killer features that Kindle probably can't match.

IE, new models don't make old models obsolete, maybe. Kindle doesn't need more hard disk, memory, processing power. It's job stay the same.

I think that if you can graduate in two years, you should have gone to a school that was more challenging to you.<p>This is probably a result of my own college experiences. I coasted through high school pretty easily (eg, doing tomorrow's calculus homework in class while it was still being explained). Then I went to a pretty good college, with a bunch of other people who were skilled enough to coast through college.<p>I got my ass handed to me. We all got our collective ass handed to us. It was humbling. It was also glorious. A year-long back-of-the-room calculus class was turned into a very engaging first 2/3 of a half-semester calculus class. Then, a year's worth of math at that pace was compressed again into six weeks of summer school thick enough to kill a man. I didn't put in extra effort learning beyond my classes, because the classes themselves kept me up til four in the morning.[1]<p>So, in short, I agree with the title of the post, you should be learning/acting at your level, not below it. However, I disagree with the main corollary of the post, which is that school is insufficient to reach that level, and you should buck the system because it's not good enough. There are schools good enough. I think it's better to find the appropriate system than to buck a normal one, because you have a much more support.[2] Slamming through four math courses in a month is a lot easier when you have four professors and a dozen peers who are all on the same page as you. You also happen to learn a lot about teamwork and collaboration that you might not by going solo.<p>[1] Which is not to say that every waking second was spent working; I covered 6 seasons of Deep Space Nine and 4 seasons of Babylon 5 in a year. Rest is more important than sleep.<p>[2] The better support is also self-reinforcing of the quality of the peers. If there are students performing below the bar, a school that can raise those students up doesn't have as great a need to lower the bar for them.",1259717452

Our low-cost high-efficiency intelligent LED controls are designed to reproduce the full natural spectrum of lighting - more like natural sunlight than ever before possible.<p>Incandescents do generate high quality light but they too fall short at reproducing natural sunlight. Unfortunately because Incandescents were dominant for so long the industry has established a color rendering index (CRI) based on a black-body radiator which considers incandescent to be perfect even though it actually falls far short.<p>Fluorescents and Compact fluorescents produce horrible light as a result of the phosphor coating used to create white light. LEDs can be much better, though admittedly not all are.<p>All in all LED lighting is the future for a whole host of reasons.

In Craig's quoted statement about RSS feeds, it seems that they are concerned about commercial use of CL data. If Yahoo Pipes essentially masks the origin of the request, then it makes CL's job more difficult.<p>As for determining motive -- profit or otherwise -- I suspect it's more about keeping others' greedy mitts off their community than cold cash. CL has been about the community of people using it since it was just a mailing list, and publicly Craig and Craigslist have been pretty clear about what they value. So, they probably see pipes as a threat to that community.",1259716469

Producing content to satisfy the fleeting curiosity of the masses is not ""bad,"" it is simply not going to produce quality work. It is a perfectly valid business though. There is nothing inherently wrong or evil about producing content that will satiate an individual's quick desire to get a few facts about something topical.<p>On the other hand, producing ""journalism"" should not be considered ""good"" simply b/c it holds itself to a higher standard. Yes, it may produce better work, but that alone does not make it a viable business plan.<p>Associated Content should not be condemned simply because it does not produce quality content.

Day job eats up over 12 hours of my day (include prep + commute).  Then the family service thing goes on for at least 4 hours, usually more with the clean up miscellaneous house things.  The majority of the days, I find my important duties finally ends around 11pm, on most weekdays.  Exceptions are like yesterday where late night day job phone conferences has me up past midnight.  Weekends, you can replace the time with the day job with family service.  I think this is where as the kids grow older and more independent, I can reap back some time for plan B.<p>I just can't help but wonder how different my life would have been if I pursued doing my own thing more aggressively 10 years ago.

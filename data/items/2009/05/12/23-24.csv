You might as well have been discussing the ""jabberwockyness"" of a company.  What would it even mean for a company have atherosclerosis?  In what sense could a company be said to be stenotic?  What elements of the company would correspond to the various components of arterial plaque?  What about a company could be said to correspond to a transient ischemic attack?  How could you identify a company whose 'plaque' is characterized by the presence of lipid-rich necrotic core vs. one that has juxtaluminal hemorrhage or one that is calcified?  Can you mitigate the symptoms of an atherosclerotic company via administration of rt-PA or via endarterectomy?  No obvious analogues for these features of atherosclerosis exist in the context of a company.  The analogy is not just a leaky abstraction; it's a broken one.",1242172789

So it could be counter-productive if your team isn't in excellent shape, because a <i>poorly executed</i> press (say, if your team is tired) makes it easy for the offense  to just blow by you and hit layups.<p>That said, a team of good ball-handlers can beat a strong press if they stay calm and pass well. Patience and poise.<p>(Which is probably why the press is so effective in younger leagues: players at that age get frantic under pressure and just don't have the dexterity/skill to keep the ball under control)",1242172757

606273,comment,605897,605897,0,0,azanar,,,"Learning the language and the du jour APIs will also not make you a skilled Java developer, which is what I think the author means; doing that in any language X will not make you an X developer of any reasonably high skill.<p>The problem I have with posts like this is that they seem to be focusing entirely on the wrong way of learning to develop software. They work from the assumption that becoming a developer is a matter of memorization, and the reason they aren’t there yet is because they haven’t memorized enough API definitions or acronyms.<p>Approaching anything from this level of abstraction results in needing to learn most everything as if it were a completely new area of knowledge. And it is an <i>incredible</i> timesink, as the author has already confessed<p>Instead of realizing the need for a hash table to solve a problem, and researching what options are available in this language, they either perform a scan of all of the options and pick the one available that looks best, or they rely on some mnemonic to decide what data structure to use without really understanding why it should be used. Both arrive at approximately the same place -- hopefully -- but they approached it from entirely different directions.<p>The former developer already knows the metaphor he is looking for, and thus his search will be very limited in size and when he finds class/library/etc. he needs the API will already make some intuitive sense provided it implements what it claims to.<p>The latter developer has no metaphorical basis for what they are doing, and thus even when they find something that works, they’ll have to rote memorize the API, because to them it’s just a formless black box.<p>To answer the author's question about what APIs one ought to know, my response is that the author is asking the wrong question. I’d like to ask what has convinced them that APIs and acronyms are the thing most worth knowing. It seems to me the author's time could be far better spent learning the metaphors and theory behind those acronyms and APIs, and then realizing that finding and learning new APIs and class libraries aren’t all that tricky once the fundamentals are understood.",1242171676

606265,comment,605577,606109,0,0,mtinkerhess,,,"I'm on the 2nd generation Touch with OS 2.2. Here's what I think the problem was: I was on wifi shortly before I tried out Numbrosia so my iPod thought it was online. I can reproduce this at home by turning off my wifi. It goes to the ""Syncing with server..."" screen for a full minute before deciding it's timed out, during which time it's non-responsive. I didn't let it go for the full minute before; I assumed it was hanging. I would have preferred that the app was responsive during that time -- touching would being up a ""Cancel"" option or something.<p>I've also figured out that ""Solve new puzzle"" on the high scores menu is a button. In retrospect that should have been obvious but at the time my attention was focused on the ""Tap row to redo puzzle"" instruction -- I expected a list of levels to choose from. I guess you can write that one off to user error.<p>I've played through a few more levels. The controls, which were awkward at first, are becoming more intuitive. You're right, solving lots of puzzles is easy once you get the hang of it, and the challenge lies in trying to match the world record score. My preference would be that the levels get more difficult to complete as you progress. I'm just brainstorming here -- maybe the player could only have a certain number of moves to complete the level in? That's kind of what it boils down to anyway, trying to match the world record. Aside from that I don't know how much more difficult the levels can get without changing something fundamental to the game mechanics.<p>I'd say the game looks complete and polished as it is. The puzzle space is a crowded one where users are hesitant to learn a new set of rules unless they know it's going to pay off with rewarding gameplay -- and they often won't know the gameplay will be rewarding until they've tried the game. What I've been trying to do myself is to produce app after app rather than work on revising an app after it's out -- I've found I improve the quality of my output more rapidly by starting new projects from scratch rather than improving on already-finished projects. I look forward to seeing what you do next!",1242171115

They thoroughly nailed him with a misdemeanor and a felony which are arguably reasonable, hence there's no need to apply a computer hacking law in a plainly unreasonable way.<p>As applied here it means that any use of a computer ""beyond the scope of the express consent"" is a felony.

606260,comment,605720,606222,0,0,donaldc,,,"One of the points of the article was that, due to its incessant running practice, the full-court press team was in better cardiovascular shape than the other team, able to pull off the constant movement required for a full-court press. Whereas the other team generally wasn't in that kind of running shape. They might have been faster in some sense, but simply weren't up to the constant movement required.<p>Clearly, the other team could easily have beaten the full-court press team, had it put a similar amount of preparatory effort into running. But generally, the other team did not. In this way effort trumped skill.<p>I realize the article was largely anecdotal, except for the study of wars fought over the last 200 years. This makes its conclusions suspect, but not necessarily invalid. Perhaps a full-court press only works when the weaker team has put in a huge amount of endurance practice in preparation, and the stronger team has not.",1242170736

You might argue they haven&#x27;t, but this isn&#x27;t absurd.<p>It&#x27;s pretty logically and mathematically definitive, only in present society with bankers gone wild could it be terribly questionable who owns what.  Common sense is usually sufficient.<p>> And if you want Rand cite for that, read the Roark/Rand courtroom soliloquy where it&#x27;s explained why it&#x27;s OK for him to blow up a building (sure, other people may have put in sweat and equity, but that&#x27;s nothing compared to his contract).<p>Honestly, it&#x27;s been ages since I&#x27;ve read that book so I can&#x27;t comment intelligently.  That sounds pretty crazy, but I have a feeling you&#x27;re taking a negative interpretation, although I may be wrong.  I tend to find Rand&#x27;s larger principles correct, if not practical, while I differ on some of the smaller ones (Food Safety / restaurant inspections come to mind).",1378774718

Nothing&#x27;s stopping you from fabricating new enclosures for Nexus 4s. You could even mass produce them, and repackage new Nexus 4s as a value-added service for people. You could, theoretically, buy up busted iPhones from ebay and repack them as Android devices - although it&#x27;d be much easier to buy one of the million fake iPhones from China, which are already basically reference Android devices.<p>On the UI side, Samsung was on the way to shipping their devices with an iOS clone around the time of the S2. If you want an Android experience which is very similar to iOS, you could even look at MIUI [1], which rips off a bunch of Apple&#x27;s design philosophy.<p>In short, everything you asked for is already very possible, it&#x27;s just that nobody is handing it to you on a platter.

For example, as a political science major you would not be nearly as employable as a computer science major, which would translate to more risk of default. This would ensure that only those who are serious about a political science degree would pursue it, and at a big picture level things would shift so that people would think about the real value of their education much more carefully.<p>Imagine a situation where you are looking at a list of majors, and next to each item there is a percentage score, which is the loan rate. For electrical engineering it might be 2.5%, whereas for art it might be 9%.<p>But then you would also have to consider the risk that someone who is not qualified for or interested in electrical engineering would most likely drop out of it. So the formula would also have to take into account the person&#x27;s background. If they scored high on their SATs and Advanced Placement tests for math and engineering, the loan rate for EE might further go down to 2%. For those coming from a non-technical focus in high school, it might go up to 3.5%.<p>Hmm...",1378773570

6357170,comment,6355818,6356459,4,0,karpathy,,,"These are usually implemented using Structure from Motion techniques, but more specifically in this case SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). There are two sources of information: from vision and from the Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) on the phone.<p>For the vision part, you start by extracting interest points in all images (Harris keypoints, or SIFT, or similar), then you match them up by using local patch descriptors, (a reasonable implementation in OpenCV for example is the Lucas Kanade Optical Flow tracker) and once you have the correspondences you can estimate a relative 3D camera transformation that explains the motion. In this case the problem is hard because the depth of every point is unknown in addition to the camera transform.<p>For the IMU stream you can use the accelerometer and gyro in the camera which gives you an estimate for both linear and rotational acceleration. These can be integrated over time to get a reasonable guess for the camera transformations from one time point to another as well.<p>You combine the two guesses (from vision and from the phone inertial measurement units) into a best guess, and then combine that in addition with the best guess from 30 milliseconds ago to arrive at an evolving probability distribution of this best guess over time. Standard way would be something like a Kalman Filter.<p>Another issue is dealing with drift over time, as errors in estimation build up and if you&#x27;re scanning the same area your model will start to drift. This requires something called &quot;Loop Closure&quot; which optimizes the camera matrices across the entire duration of scan and not only frame to frame. This is very computational intensive and hard to do online and without it scans for longer than few seconds will get progressively uglier and misaligned.<p>This stuff is super tricky to get right. Also, be skeptical of these demos because they are easy to can. It&#x27;s fairly easy to get that one shot where it looks like it works, but in practice these are exceptionally fragile and very very difficult to get working. Though I&#x27;m impressed it seemed to work okay inside the mall -- with all the specular reflections from the floor.

I was comparing renting to what the dome-builder was doing. With that said, renting vs. ownership is obviously situational.<p>To live 2 miles (walking distance) from downtown Denver:<p>~650 for rent\n~150 for a garage w/ electricity\n~100 for utilities<p>$900 month.<p>When I looked into buying in Denver anywhere in the same distance, I was looking at $1250 month w/ no garage, unless I lived in the Arts District (a bit rougher), and most of those houses needed to be torn down.",1378771616

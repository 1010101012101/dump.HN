3869530,comment,3867856,3867856,3,0,inoop,,,"For those that are interested in how this works: it's basically a feature of the 802.11 MAC. When a station STA1 transmits an RTS packet (request to send) to some other STA2, STA2 has to respond with a CTS (clear to send) packet (collision avoidance, hidden terminal problem). So basically if a detector knows that a mobile station exists with some MAC address, it can 'ping' it by sending RTS packets to it. It has to know a) the MAC address, which it can learn by overhearing probe request sent by the mobile station when its scanning for access points, and b) the channel the station is on. Of course, you can ping repeatedly on different channels or use multiple Wi-Fi transceivers.<p>Note that when the mobile station is associated with an access point that uses PSM (power saving mode) this does not work because the mobile station is in sleep mode 99% of the time and only wakes up periodically to catch a beacon packet from the access point.<p>By pinging the mobile station and measuring the received signal strength of the CTS response packet at various locations you can triangulate the location of the mobile station (or better yet, use fingerprinting, MLE).",1334951812

3869494,comment,3868159,3868159,3,0,adriand,,,"If you want to learn how to develop iOS apps, then you should learn Objective C.  I'm a Ruby developer and as much as I love the language, when I decided I also wanted to write iOS apps I bit the bullet and started learning Objective C.  In the process I've found that learning Objective C is actually pretty easy - as the author of this post points out, it's CocoaTouch and the overall Xcode and iOS ecosystem and environment that takes time to learn.<p>This is fairly analogous to learning Ruby on Rails if you know neither Ruby nor Rails, although because I had experience with curly-brace/semicolon languages and pointers (a bit of C, plus PHP and Javascript) I found that learning Objective C was easier for me than learning Ruby.  But just like Rails is a steep mountain to climb, so is CocoaTouch.<p>However, learning Objective C and CocoaTouch has been fun, enjoyable, enlightening, and well worth it.  As the old saying goes, if something is worth doing, it is worth doing right.  If you believe developing iOS apps is worth doing, then do it right with Objective C.  You won't regret it, and by adding another language, framework, and way of doing things to your toolbelt, you'll become a better Ruby programmer too.",1334951343

The idea did come out to me after seeing kickstarter a couple of times. I even remember that one of the names I was playing with was Bootstrap.it or something similar. My logic went along the same lines as your edit. People would not only be able to donate monetary funds, but then each company would have access to a network of different individuals, some of whom would be willing to help out with advice, or maybe if one was a lawyer, he'd help them get incorporated, that kind of stuff.<p>Essentially it's because of SEC. First of all you have (had) the 500 limit for investors, so any fundraiser where only, let's say 400 people, could give money would be rather shitty.<p>Then the other part was that if you wanted to invest in early stage startups, you have to be an accredited investor. That is you have to either make 200K a year for the last two years (or 300K together with a spouse) or have $1 million in the bank.

3869352,comment,3867380,3869021,2,0,noelwelsh,,,"Good questions. I'll do my best to answer them.<p>1. We assume that the distribution of rewards for each lever is fixed (over the short term). This allows the reward to vary randomly so long as the average reward (over the short term -- days to weeks) is constant. There are more complex schemes, which allow for greater variation in reward, but the initial Myna offering is intended to be directly comparable to A/B testing.<p>2. It's not necessary to assume that feedback is instantaneous. Basically you can continue to make suggestions (pull levers) in proportion to your best estimate of their expected return and the maths holds. Very long conversion cycles will cause problems for any system, I think, as you'll spend a long time in a random walk. In these cases we recommend using a proxy measure which is correlated with conversion, if one is available. As for one option speeding up conversion, I don't think that will matter as you'll simply refine your estimate of one lever faster. I haven't thought too much about this particular issue; it would be worth doing some simulations to see.<p>3. Just turn off the bandit when you've satisfied with the results. That is, you can use Myna like A/B testing, and the Myna UI displays confidence bounds for this very reason, while still getting the benefits of optimising as data arrives.<p>4. I actually like bandit algs as there is less for the user to mess up. You don't have to worry about how much data to collect, what p value to use, and so on. Just set it running and it optimises automatically.",1334949420

It's really quite simple...<p>Wikipedia's version, ""Some travellers come to a village, carrying nothing more than an empty cooking pot. Upon their arrival, the villagers are unwilling to share any of their food stores with the hungry travellers. Then the travellers go to a stream and fill the pot with water, drop a large stone in it, and place it over a fire. One of the villagers becomes curious and asks what they are doing. The travellers answer that they are making ""stone soup"", which tastes wonderful, although it still needs a little bit of garnish to improve the flavour, which they are missing. The villager does not mind parting with a few carrots to help them out, so that gets added to the soup. Another villager walks by, inquiring about the pot, and the travellers again mention their stone soup which has not reached its full potential yet. The villager hands them a little bit of seasoning to help them out. More and more villagers walk by, each adding another ingredient. Finally, a delicious and nourishing pot of soup is enjoyed by all.""",1334948754

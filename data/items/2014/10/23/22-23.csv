8501178,comment,8498782,8500398,0,0,lmkg,,,"I think comparing <i>Brave New World</i> to <i>1984</i> misses a bit of the point. The books came out near each other and deal with similar themes, so they very often get compared to each other. But they are also significant and important books in isolation.<p>Yes, <i>BNW</i> is a better dystopia to live in than <i>1984</i>. But... it&#x27;s still a dystopia. Free thinkers are socially ostracized, personal preferences (outside a certain set) are ignored, personal destiny is decided at conception (one case where the world of <i>1984</i> is preferable). It&#x27;s a shocking world, and one that I wouldn&#x27;t want to live in.<p>And inevitably, the discussion revolves around the fact that it&#x27;s not as bad as <i>1984</i>. As if &quot;actually only the second-worst dystopia in classic fiction&quot; is anything but damning.<p>Having a dystopia-off distracts from a significant part of the value that these works have to us as members of a society: There is more than one road to hell (and more than one hell to reach). <i>1984</i> shows an example of a possible future, why it is bad, and how it got that way. <i>BNW</i> shows an example of a very different future, why it is bad, and (less clearly) how it got that way. They give useful common ideas for possible outcomes of current actions. While <i>BNW</i> is preferable to <i>1984</i>, it still shows that avoiding a <i>1984</i> outcome as hard as you can is not enough because there are other ways that freedom can be destroyed. To simply say &quot;I would prefer my freedom be destroyed in one of these two ways&quot; is not the most useful thing one can take away from reading these two books.",1414105039

Unfortunately in the wider population, Google&#x27;s image is nigh unassailable.

While the obvious explanation of the dot-com boom fits, I would say students graduating at this time were considerably affected by the 1980s home computing culture and that early experiences with a C64 or other computer could have been positive, not negative, influences on their choice to study CS.<p>(The reason I say this being that I graduated with a CS degree in 2003, so am squarely in that camp, and the dot-com boom had no bearing on that decision - by the time I had picked my A-level subjects and applied to university, the dot-com craziness was not in full swing, though I was in the UK.

The mill is mechanically in absolutely excellent condition, it only has a few hundred hours on it total because the electronics burned out in a bad way after it was installed in a school in the previous century.<p>I&#x27;m giving it away because I intend to sell the warehouse and my friend who was going to rebuild it has stated un-ambiguously that he&#x27;s no longer interested in the project.<p>So, for the very large price of $0 you are more than welcome to this beast provided that you have the ability to transport it. I have no crane or other facilities to lift the monster, estimated weight is 1.2 metric tonne.<p>There are <i>NO</i> electronics with the machine, nor are there servos with it, you&#x27;re going to have to fit servos (or maybe even steppers) to it to get it running as well as probably a VFD to control the main spindle motor. This project is definitely not for the timid.<p>If you&#x27;re seriously interested then please drop me a line, the machine is located in Eygelshoven, Limburg, The Netherlands, so presumably it&#x27;s within easy transportation reach of a good chunk of France and Germany as well as all of Luxembourg, the Netherlands and of course Belgium.<p>I can&#x27;t do any showings or other luxuries, I live 300 Km away from the warehouse myself but I do have a friend locally that will be happy to open it up and clear a path to the machine prior to removal.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for a stable base for your 3D CNC milling project you&#x27;re probably not going to find anything better. If you want a desktop mill or this would be your first CNC project then this is probably not for you.<p>A picture of the beast:<p>http://pics.camarades.com/v/jacques/machines/dscf1225.jpg.html?g2_imageViewsIndex=1",1414103584

That is not to say that previous generations were much better, but gone were the days where the space race inspired tons of kids to pursue STEM education regardless of gender.",1414102759

8501011,comment,8498972,8500331,0,0,webnrrd2k,,,"Generally speaking, those that are likely to take advantage of various programs by themselves have already done so. They aren&#x27;t a big secret or anything. A visit to the local Social Security office is about all it takes to get connected. Maybe the VA if your military. It can take a day or so, and be a real PITA, but nothing that&#x27;s super hard to manage. So the people who don&#x27;t get in these programs are mostly, for whatever reason,the types that don&#x27;t want to go.<p>It&#x27;s hard to say, because it&#x27;s an emotional thing, not a rational thing, but I think of it as two broad categories of resistance... I tend think of them as &quot;structure&quot; and &quot;content&quot;[1].<p>Some people have physical, structural problems with their brains -- they had a serious brain injury, a concussion, or stroke, or something; and they are functional enough to stay out of prison or not cause obvious problems, but their brain  is shot or they just can&#x27;t get themselves to focus for long enough to make any real headway with getting help on their own. I&#x27;d bet some just have ADHD, or some other organic/structural problem with their brain.<p>Many of seem to have had a bad childhood, or a real bad experience at some point, and it left them feeling so poorly about themselves that they just expect the world to crap on them, like there is nothing they can do about it. They might descend into depression, or addiction, or spin off into some fantasy world, or deal with it in some other destructive way. I&#x27;ve noticed that the earlier things went wrong then the worse the effects seem to be, but this is strongly dependent on the person and what actually happened, and their current environment that it&#x27;s hard to say anything useful.<p>So that&#x27;s how I think about it, but what I do is to try to gently push people in the direction of getting help and making their life better, sometimes hold their hands, and not worry too much about who it is or their current situation in life. Sometimes I&#x27;m better than others, and I&#x27;m better with some people than others, so I don&#x27;t beat myself up if I can&#x27;t really help.<p>[1] Just to get a little philosophical - they aren&#x27;t really separate, just a useful way of thinking about what&#x27;s going on. I&#x27;m a Buddhist, and the structure/content idea helps me to see how my own mind works. For example, if I drink a lot of coffee and get really cranked up -- that&#x27;s more of a physical/structural explanation of why I experience the world a certain way. If I have certain thoughts (&quot;I&#x27;ll never get this damn code right&quot;, or &quot;my life is crap&quot;) then that leads me to experience the world a certain way -- neither mean the world actually <i>is</i> that way.",1414101887

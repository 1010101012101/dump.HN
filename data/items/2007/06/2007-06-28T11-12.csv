I agree with plusBryan that it is important to have many options. <p>Frameworks have their own strengths and weaknesses inherited from the languages used to build them. <p>So quit the hating, please I don't get why RoR dudes(not all of them in fairness) love to bash hackers using other languages or frameworks. Although blogs like this tend to bring out alot of passionate if not misguided individuals.<p>I say pick your tools for the job. ",1183030809

TG2.0 will be based on the core elements on Pylons--including Paste and SQLAlchemy.  Pylons will remain a lower level collection of WSGI tools, and TG will create the high level framework with more of decisions made for you.  I'm not crazy about Genshi and XML templating languages but otherwise this is good news.

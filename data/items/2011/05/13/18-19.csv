2545723,comment,2545603,2545603,1,0,ssebro,,,"I have a problem with this: I'm extremely curious and I wind up going down long paths to find the ultimate solution to problems, when I could have just asked someone about it. I do it because I learn + remember better, and because the ""How"" is important to me. My problem is that wanting to know the ""How"" is often at odds with getting stuff done very quickly, and that being someone who gets stuff done quickly often becomes your personal brand - something that you are known for. So tradeoffs between the two aren't encouraged in the workplace- it's often one or another.<p>Thoughts?",1305313127

The problem is that you have to do everything through <i>bind</i>.

Like megahertz, megapixel is a nice single number that many customers associated with performance but it's pretty far from truth.

With a typical RDBMS, doing a full table scan depends on the current stats (e.g., number of rows, are the stats current, state of the index, possibility to use an index, presence of cached data, previous query performance etc.). It does not depend only on the query and the data structure, so it is near <i></i>impossible<i></i> at development time to be certain that a table scan will occur during production. In fact, a table scan might occur today and not tomorrow for the same query, but with different data.<p>Many developers have been burned by trying to optimize their queries and indexes too early. The query planner, although sometimes unpredictable, is generally better than developers at predicting the performance of a particular execution plan. Table scans are also preferable in certain situations.<p>Relying on the fact that RDBMS have sophisticated query planner (as opposed to MongoDB) is not a sign of ""reactive development"". It just means that you should test your queries (and your indexes) with close-to-production data, and, as the data grows and evolves, continue to test, because the best execution plan might change.",1305312041

It was definitely dead in 2009 when Sony released cameras with Exmor backlit sensors and competed with a similar Fuji offering.<p>In the professional market, however, it's possible to get an 80 megapixel medium format sensor and there are post-production advantages that make this worthwhile for professional use. I wouldn't be surprised if sensor resolution continued to creep up in prosumer cameras as well.<p>There are still benefits for consumers from higher sensor density and resolution, as long as it can be done without introducing noise. For example, slightly less awful digital zoom and the ability to liberally crop.",1305311940

Generally-accessible Internet services become more compelling for AOL users than the closed AOL services, so were less willing to pay a premium for AOL, decreasing their profits.  Eventually people started seeing it as just another ISP, and their original value-add was eroded -- hence their decline.<p>So yes, the Internet killed AOL.

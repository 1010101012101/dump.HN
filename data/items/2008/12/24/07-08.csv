I'd rather see a better company and one that doesn't carry a stigma (rightfully or wrongfully) that could prevent wide public investment be that bellwether.<p>Unfortunately those companies are probably staying away from even thinking IPO at this time.",1230105541

408611,comment,408420,408574,0,0,strlen,,,"1) Is that hard to believe? Yahoo only incorporated in 1995, there were start-ups before that. Unfortunately, I can't find DNS records to back this up - FFN domains seem to be registered with non-Verisign registrar which wouldn't have been arround until 1998 (when third party registrars would have been available).<p>2) AFF's founders could have already been hosting sites <i>before</i> founding AFF (indeed, it would logically follow that he'd have experience running a site before launching a successful company).<p>EDIT: Here's some proof:<p>Conru.com is registered wih Verisign and on 03-NOV-94 (Andrew Conru is the founder of AFF and you can see the FFN address and name when doing 'whois conru.com'). Yahoo.com is registered 18-JAN-1995 (do ""whois '=yahoo.com'"" to check). Seems like it's at least plausible (Stanford is a small place).",1230104458

408606,comment,404419,404557,0,0,vlad,,,"I didn't say anything about new technology or marketing hacks, but about publicizing itself to other developers, which are also either the target market or a big part of the initial target market.  Plenty of fish used the strategy of blogging about its growth, which was picked up by none other than other developers and posted about in developer and indie forums on a regular basis over the past few years.  This is exactly what I described--a developer talking about how successful their app is, which causes developers to sign up for it.  Remember, the 20-30 year old software developer demographic who would hear about the site is most likely single and with money, making them the perfect target market to seed.  This is exactly the same as creating a project management site for developers that grows in popularity to the point most users are no longer developers, or a social news site like reddit.",1230103949

These are the same elements which the Experimental Gameplay project copied.<p>There you can see a journal from all the entrants, as well as source code -- so you can learn how the better game makers approach it.<p>Many game developers use it as a chance to prototype games, and get immediate feedback as you develop.  Also to help you refine your skills to allow you to make games more rapidly.<p>It's a real buzz to enter the competition, as there's often 100 or so people working on their games at the same time.<p>Since it's from scratch, you are forced to finish things up, rather than working on engines(for you web dev people engines are the frameworks of game development).<p>If you're into making games I <i>highly</i> recommend you join in on one of these competitions :)",1230103839

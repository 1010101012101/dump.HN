You can make a Chess game both with ObjC and HTML5, but chances of someone finding your HTML5 app via Google (search) is practically zero. On the other hand, because there are less than 150 Chess games for iPhone, if a random surfer searches the App Store for 'chess', they see your icon down the list. That's the exposure I'm talking about.<p>And again, I don't like Apple's rules very much, I'm just stating that being on the App Store brings you a lot of exposure.",1334671194

It's more functional than the other Lisp, use immutable data-structures, have a lot of data types (vector, set, map, list) with literal syntax and unified abstraction on top of them and the macros are easier to write than in the other Lisp thanks to autogensym and name capturing.<p>Main selling point: it's Lisp and it's the best available.",1334671179

When I eventually have a Windows 8 machine one of the first things I'll install is Steam. Why would I change? I've already invested a great deal of money into it. It works quite well as a platform and for me to switch would require a superior platform to take its place, which I don't see coming in the near future.<p>Plus, considering Microsoft's history with PC gaming it would take a great deal for me to switch to their platform from Steam. Game for Windows Live anyone?<p>Unless Microsoft ups their game (bad pun!) in terms of actually supporting PC gaming then I would think Valve will be just fine. I'm willing to bet Xbox Live integration on Windows 8 is not a selling point to Valve's market.<p>If someone from Microsoft suggested I should switch from Steam to their platform I would laugh in his face.",1334671149

Yes, Array#to_s did perform a join, but it was never the method intended to do a join - thats #join. This should never be done in the first place. Use the tools that are meant for the job, even if the other is more convenient (although I never understood this specific case, I always used #join). It will bite you if you don't. Another example was using #map without block as a #to_a alternative (which now returns an Enumerator).<p>Also, it shows that a lot of naming problems were actually corrected in the transition to 1.9, like the #type<>#class thing. Less is better and I am grateful that the core team actually made some cuts.<p>In the end, my personal experience is that upgrading to 1.9 is not that much pain as many say.

I very much enjoyed reading this ""Okay, I have my hook set on something big.  How do I pull it into the boat?""<p>I would recommend doing a lot of little things in different directions that can be measured then focusing on the ideas that show the most promise.<p>Pick the low-hanging fruit first, like ad sense.  Keep the ad box small and unobtrusive.  You could set it up in a day and see how it performs.  You can always remove it later.<p>A simple mobile app that you could give away for free shouldn't take long to write.  That will get you something installed on lots of devices that you could then use as a foothold for upgrades and premium features down the road.<p>Finally, find ways to reach out to your users and really tap into what they want from the site.  Build ways into your site to get that reach and to take metrics of everything they're doing.  In real terms, I'm talking integrated surveys, A/B testing of interfaces and features, and ways for you to increase the channels of communication between you and your users.

3852512,comment,3851482,3851482,10,0,nirvana,,,"When it comes to cinema, optical fundamentals are the most important for getting high production value from an indie budget.  That means lenses of course, but this is a camera we're talking about, which means sensor size has a huge impact.  Compare the size of this camera's sensor (About micro-4/3s) to APS-C and Full frame 35mm.  It is about 1/4th the size of a full frame sensor.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sensor_sizes_overlaid_inside.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sensor_sizes_overlaid_ins...</a><p>A larger sensor allows for better low light images with less noise.  It also allows for significantly more control over depth of field (and it is this control that distinguishes ""cinema"" from ""video"" in people's minds to a great degree.)<p>You can buy HD (2k) shooting cameras with full frames from Canon for about this price.  You can buy APS-C 2k cameras from Sony for 1/3 the price (leaving more money for nice lenses).  The NEX-7 seems to be a pretty ideal choice, in fact.<p>Sure, these cameras don't shoot RAW, but then, you don't really need RAW.   RED made RAW popular with their no compromises approach and that's very nice, if you have the money, but notice that RED didn't compromise on their sensors, and actually has (or is promising, you never know with RED) very large sensors.   24mbps HD is more than sufficient for indie filmmakers in most cases.  Granted, I think a 48mbps compressed stream would be about ideal. I wish Sony and Canon would make that an option.<p>I think in this camera, so much went into the ability to record in RAW that to make their price point they had to compromise on the sensor, and that's the wrong compromise.  You pull raw off of the sensor in every camera, but carrying it all the way to the storage medium forces you to spend a lot of money on each stage, including shipping the camera with an SSD, and naturally, Thunderbolt then makes sense, but it too adds to the price.<p>At sundance I've seen movies shot on DV (an SD format) that worked as movies. We've all seen HD movies in the cinemas- for instance Revenge of The Sith was delivered as a 1920x817 frame- HD cut down to make a wider aspect ratio.[1]<p>And of course when you're working with RAW it affects the rest of your production pipeline- you need more storage space to keep your footage, backups get bigger, you need more bandwidth to your storage and you need a heavier CPU to work with it, etc.  The final deliverable isn't going to be RAW, its likely to be HD (at least in many cases) and so I'd rather spend that budget on optical quality, and in a camera that means sensor.<p>I do hope these guys find great success, as the japanese really could use some good competition.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CineAlta"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CineAlta</a><p>-----------------<p>Edit to add: I wrote the above response based on the EOSHD article, but checking the BlackMagic website, I better understand why they made the choices they did.   I still think that if they'd gone with an APS-C sensor, or full frame, this would be much more exciting.  But now I'd weight their choice of improved capture via raw as about equal to the impact of sensor size in image quality.",1334670471

Concurrent programs are needed for a lot of problems, and are difficult to get right.<p>3. The seq abstractions are good. If you program idiomatic clojure, your program is as concise as your ruby code.<p>4. It doesn't support conventional OOP, but allows inter-operability with Java and class generation. When you are programming clojure, you use records and types which are Clojure's way of doing OOP.<p>All that said, look at a couple of programs written in Clojure, and try translating it to the language you are familiar with.

In my 5 years at Google, I never once experienced that fear. I learned a long time ago that my life with my wife and kids were far more important than anything at work, so I left the office around 5-6 almost every day. No one ever said a word to me about it, and it never obstructed my ability to earn more money over time and rise through the company. There were plenty of my colleagues who did the same.<p>What fuels the people that stay late isn't fear, it's a culture that celebrates putting in long hours. It's a poor proxy for productivity, but people (especially those in their early twenties) seem to equate long hours with getting lots of shit done. Of course that's not actually true in many cases, but that's beside the point. Like everything else, you get what you celebrate, and in this case you get people basically living at the office.<p>When you add in free meals, laundry, haircuts, and all other manner of perks, you get people who make the (totally rational) decision that being at work is easier than fending for yourself at home. The moment this translates into a perception that ""that guy is working his ass off"", you get staying late as a part of your company culture.<p>PS - Many of these folks working until 10pm also don't get into the office until 11am.

If the study group is small, as it is here, using only a handful of rats, then the size of the effect can be much more readily distorted by chance. This line in the paper jumped out at me: ""Before C60 administration, the rats were fasted overnight but with access to water.""

Creative? Sure! It was almost as good as a print ad, even though it&#x27;s likely that few real readers actually read the thing. Violating Google&#x27;s guidelines? Fuck yes!!<p>Google has no access to the bank accounts of these writers to verify that the links were paid for. The search quality team can&#x27;t plum the e-mail accounts of everyone involved to see that said articles were commissioned to include specific anchor text.<p>It&#x27;s quite difficult to establish objectively whether or not the writers were paid for this. However, I can say that whenever black hatters write these kinds of articles, we&#x27;re instructed by the client to include certain anchor text types, and to vary the anchor text for different articles in the same campaign.<p>Further, botted traffic adds another ugly layer to gaming SEO. The publisher just has to &#x27;look&#x27; legitimate. The traffic can even be semi-botted by offices full of Indians using software for that purpose.",1388300320

There&#x27;s even a certain elegance to things like [ being (potentially) a program that behaves as any other would.<p>It is quite primitive as languages go, though, and has some ugly quirks, but I think it&#x27;s a mistake to look at it and say it needs to be changed to be more like things not designed to treat running programs as primitives. I&#x27;d rather see something from someone who said &quot;bash is great but could be so much better!&quot; than someone who said &quot;bash is TEERRRRRUUUBLE and we must replace it!&quot;<p>That said what I want so much more than a new shell is one that isn&#x27;t stuck letting me only reason about the machine I&#x27;m logged in on.

BTC isn&#x27;t a good value store (or have intrinsic value) just because the infrastructure that processes it is--in a different sense of the word--valuable. If a bitcoin conferred a fraction of ownership of that infrastructure to the coin&#x27;s holder, you&#x27;d have a point, but it doesn&#x27;t; the holder just has the coin. The parts of the infrastructure you might actually sell are owned by someone else, and the open source parts of it are owned--in the sense relevant here--by everyone, so it doesn&#x27;t provide the coin any value. It&#x27;s like saying gold is a good value store because mining and ore extraction equipment are useful. Doesn&#x27;t make any sense.<p>Of course, you can say the infrastructure makes the coin more useful as a <i>medium of exchange</i>, but that&#x27;s a totally separate point, as Krugman points out.<p>My personal view is that none of these things--gold, dollars, or bitcoin--has enough intrinsic value to make a useful value floor, and that as value stores they all just rely on a shared convention. So I&#x27;m not sure Krugman is right, and perhaps bitcoins will work out without that floor feature, and perhaps without ever really being used as a store of value. But this argument about infrastructure just doesn&#x27;t work.",1388298968

6978605,comment,6977948,6977948,4,0,grogenaut,,,"I said this in a lower thread but I figured it&#x27;s better up here.<p>Why is there not a standard for links of this type in browsers. Eg <a href=&quot;url&quot; sigurl=&quot;url to sig&quot; sigalgo=&quot;algo to calculate signature&quot;>OpenSSL</a><p>That&#x27;s a simple way to go but I really think it&#x27;s as generally insecure as reading a signature form a url that is advertised by a website. It&#x27;s also why I rarely bother.<p>But if browsers were good about this then it could be done in a much better way which is to sign the application with a real peer verifiable signing method. Such as the SSL cert that covers the site behind the open source project .<p>now this only works for projects that have SSL certs. Another method would be to have a clearing house that can do 1-1 with github et al and a re cert, like a oss cert organization.  A final good way would be to use the beauty of git and use the source checksums and a repeatable build process (which is fricking hard) and come up with a way to give a signature for oss applications based on a git commit and check that back to the public git repository.<p>really I think knwon public keys for oss projects and branches would be the real answer. And the security gating for newbs would be like windows and linux which check the public signature of the application before they run them from the web and make the end user feel safe instead of doing nothing.<p>Browsers have a good share in this responsibility as well. Standard domain security should work well here as well. Better than what we have.<p>I leave this to more entreprenurial minds to make this work and I&#x27;d love some real telegraph style sinkers to point out the flaws.  This is must me talking after a belated xmas dinner. but I think I&#x27;m kind of on course.",1388296884

It might not be $1000 or even $100 per ounce, but it is at least a floor of $1 or $10.<p>The complaint Mr Krugman is registering is that Bitcoin&#x27;s don&#x27;t even have that.

They've even got Rose Ventures (<a href=""http://www.rhventures.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rhventures.org/</a>), a start up friendly organization (using appropriately educated students as cheap labor for small companies).",1225701671

When a single person is responsible for most of the major decisions on a project, the project will either spectacularly fail or will be amazing, depending on the genius of the person. But when you take the same genius, and force him to change his concept to bring in elements of more traditional people, you will tend to create a normal product.<p>Designing by consensus will always lead to an average product. The only way to create a blow-out success is if a single person handles the design part of things.<p>No major artwork was created by a comittee. None of the great books were written by a newsroom team. Engineering has to go the same way. Let people use their imaginations without being constrained by the opinions of tens of other people.",1225699779

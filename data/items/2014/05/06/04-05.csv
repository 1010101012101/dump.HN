7702907,comment,7698403,7700195,1,0,hcarvalhoalves,,,"Have you ever programmed graphics?<p>To make a paralell, usually in graphics your main loop reacts to events (user input) and you change some internal state in some object(s). Finally, you get all those objects that know how to render themselves, see what&#x27;s relevant and render the whole scene. You don&#x27;t have to care about pixels, you just react to events and blit a representation of the entire state.<p>React.js is the same, the difference being your components &quot;render&quot; themselves to the DOM, and because it&#x27;s a tree, it&#x27;s naturally composable. It&#x27;s still a pipeline taking state and outputing a representation though.",1399352087

Since then he&#x27;s found it extremely easy to learn other programming languages, despite their extensive differences from Haskell.<p>There&#x27;s also a lot to be said for habit-forming. Imperative languages teach you a lot of habits and cause you to develop assumptions that might actually make it harder to learn a language as different as Haskell.

Had they profiled their benchmark, they would have noticed this.<p>This is just from one minute of looking. There are probably more problems. Unfortunately, I find this is typical of benchmarks that claim something is massively faster than Protobufs.

But I&#x27;d been doing a lot of drugs and my mental health was way off base and I started talking to my boss about how I was the best programmer in the company and how he wasn&#x27;t paying me enough and some other silly shit. Eventually I managed to convince him to convert me to a contractor, so I was working at the same job, without benefits, for a whopping $5K extra a year (if I worked 40/hrs a week for 48 weeks).<p>He didn&#x27;t let me go as full-time before making sure that I had access to mental health resources -- his biggest concern was that I get the help I needed, but I assured him that living in Canada (I worked remotely) I had access to mental health care if I needed it. Of course I was certain that I did not need it.<p>Eventually, things came to a head, and I experienced psychosis to the point where I called the cops and told them someone was spying on me and they certified me and took me away to a psych ward against my wishes.<p>Things have changed a lot since then and I am much healthier and haven&#x27;t used any non-prescription drugs (including alcohol) for about a year and a half (I&#x27;m lying, I have tried and failed to quit cigarette smoking a few times). The whole me getting taken away incident was about 3 years ago and neither of us work for that company any longer. But I&#x27;ve made amends for the grief I caused him (really, my description above just scratched the surface), and we are on good terms. Today I consider him a friend.<p>He was the first person who told me to get help. Honestly, that means so much to me.<p>If anybody wants any more context or someone to talk to about substance abuse problems or mental health issues, I am definitely no professional, but I have personal experience and would be happy to let you know how things went for me and how I got my life back together. My psychiatrist doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to see me anymore (I&#x27;m a bit torn on that one) and jokes that they should hire me because I&#x27;ve learned and followed their program so well. But a big hint for the main thing behind my success (first suggested to me by my psychiatrist, in fact): To paraphrase Craig Ferguson, &quot;You can find us at the beginning of the phonebook.&quot; (I know a lot of people can&#x27;t get over the &quot;god&quot;/&quot;higher power&quot; thing.

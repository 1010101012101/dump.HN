If at any future point that license turns out to be suboptimal, you have to renegotiate with all current and past programmers, at a disadvantage.  This is a major headache.<p>Furthermore as soon as programmers start touching each other's code, they no longer have the legal benefits of ownership. So they have the choice between licensing code to each other (winding up in the same bind as the company), or else refusing each other's changes for their personal benefit (which will be a nightmare for the company).<p>By contrast if you go the standard way and assign copyright to the company, the company has no such potential headaches.  Programmers who wish to use company code have to get permission to do so, but they only have one party to negotiate with.  And programmers have no copyright incentive to block each other's changes.  This is better all around.  Remember that the goal of a company is to reduce the necessary friction in getting work done.  Do whatever reduces possible friction the most.<p>If programmers are bringing useful code from elsewhere to the company that they plan to use elsewhere, then I would recommend having them either license it to the company under very generous terms, sell it to the company and get it licensed back, or rewrite their software.

Amazon's book-lending feature only really works with their business model as long it is just small groups of people lending to each other. They were never going to stand for people circumventing the whole model of individual payment by sharing books with random strangers over the internet.<p>I'm not saying Amazon (and the whole e-book industry) is morally right in restricting sharing like this, but you can't expect them not to stand up for their own interests.<p>In the long term, I'm sure we'll end up with freely distributable e-books.

It's like a function, but its domain can also be enumerated so we can generate useful documentation about how a widget responds.  So a Widget takes program and user inputs, and generates program and user outputs.<p>Any state (e.g: cursor) will be saved elsewhere, and I've come to the conclusion that separating ""GUI state"" from ""model state"" is not a good idea. This allows me to use the ""cursor"" of a box of widgets as an active selection, and not just a way to navigate, for example. It also means that I can use the same persistency model/etc for the GUI as I do for the model.<p>I wrote a simple (again, still at the POC stage) transactional, structural, revision-controlled editor based on vtywidgets (<a href=""https://github.com/Peaker/treeedit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Peaker/treeedit</a>), and it persists the model, including the GUI state, in the transactional database. This means that I get undo features for GUI state (I can store it outside the revisioned store, but it's quite nice to have), and if I kill the editor and restart it later, it is at exactly the same state it was before.",1300743824

Put another way: who is complaining about the alleged anticompetitive tactics: competitors, or consumers?<p>If one studies all the big antitrust cases of the 20th century -- from Alcoa, to DuPont, to Microsoft -- a curious trend emerges: it was always those companies' competitors who took issue with seemingly anticompetitive tactics of the big evil ""trusts,"" and rarely -- if ever -- was it the consumers themselves.<p>A great example of this is Microsoft in the 1990s: do any of you -- aside from our realm of early adopter computer savvy tech types -- genuinely remember any everyday computer users actually complaining that Windows came preinstalled with IE instead of Netscape? Were consumers actually harmed, were they actually suffering? No: the only ""people"" who had an issue with MS bundling IE with Windows -- frankly, a brilliant strategy -- were Microsoft's competitors, and not, in fact, MS's customers.<p>So my take on this ATT & T-mobile merger is simple: the investigation should not focus on whether ATT/T-mobile is a monopoly from competitors' points of view, but whether it is anticompetitive to the point of actually harming consumers, e.g., with higher prices, etc.<p>Frankly, a good example of a company that really deserves a DOJ investigation is Apple -- IFF customers start to actually complain, and not not just Apple's competitors' start to complain.<p>Put more simply: a DOJ investigation into whether a company is a monopoly should be based upon whether consumers -- not competitors -- are actually being harmed by the allegedly anticompetitive tactics of a ""monopoly.""<p>After all, a company could not become a monopoly without customers' support in the first place. So clearly they have done something right that customers appreciate.<p>A ""monopoly"" that is not causing harm to consumers, either directly or indirectly, is not necessarily so terrible a thing. In fact, as with Apple, it is often the case that consumers enjoy a net benefit from such a company.",1300743713

This is especially true over the last  3 years (I believe 3 years is the limit on a carry-forward loss credit, and 2008-2011 has been bad for business). The net effect is that US companies pay 35% taxes on their 3-year trailing average income rather than income in a given year.<p>Occasionally you will hear another breathless claim on places like reddit/The Huffington Post/The Daily Kos that some large percent of corporations pay no corporate taxes at all. They are usually counting the large number of small businesses organized as S-corps and LLCs which pay pass-through personal income taxes rather than corporate taxes, and counting all the C-corps that lost money and therefore paid no corporate taxes for the year. On its face it is a true statement that most corporations pay no taxes, but it is a very misleading statement.<p>In my experience, it is very difficult for the shareholders of a C-corp in the United States to derive benefit from the entity's business activities without the benefits being taxed at the corporate level.",1300743252

Potential acquirers are usually interested in purchasing the IP owned by a company, not just the company itself.<p>IP that a company owns can be counted as an asset when drawing up a balance sheet. It is often quite a substantial part of the assets of any major software company, making the net value of the company much higher.<p>In my experience, companies usually default to owning the intellectual property for everything an employee produces then provide a way to waive their interest on outside projects by employees.

A processes's  state is then retained in immutable structures passed to recursive invocations of its main message loop (sorry if this sounds opaque - I'd recommend seeing how it's done in Erlang).<p>Another GUI approach to FP that is being researched is functional reactive programming. There is a neat Javascript implementation called FlapJax. You could probably argue that FRP is a generalization of MVC (though I'll hedge my statement since I'm not 100% sure of this).",1300742354

2351552,comment,2350967,2351345,0,0,jacoblyles,,,"It is hard to get around the 35% US corporate tax rate. In my time as an investment banker, the only way I saw that companies could easily lower their taxes is by losing money (losing money one year gives you a carry-forward loss that you can use to get out of taxes the next, hardly free money). As far as I am aware, this kind of tax credit is common in the developed world and the US corporate taxes remain the highest. The impression that you get at reddit/ The Huffington Post/ Hollywood that you can open up a foreign bank account and <i>bam</i> no taxes is largely false. All the companies that I sold, capitalized, or researched paid taxes at close to the nominal rate of 35% (my specialty was firms $100 million to $1 billion in market cap).<p>What are your credentials? Perhaps you are a corporate tax accountant and you know better than I do.",1300741452

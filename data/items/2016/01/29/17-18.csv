The article first proclaims the unanimous agreement among economists about the benefits of free trade. It then dives into the details of <i>one</i> study who seems to contradict this consensus, and then proclaims that no real consensus exists, and even if it did exist, it&#x27;s wrong.<p>2 things:<p>First, a couple of economists disagreeing with the mainstream, among the thousands of economic researchers, does not break a consensus. If we were to wait for unanimous agreement before embarking on any policy, we would never get anywhere. As the author himself admitted, there is a very strong and prevelent belief among economists that free trade is good for America and for the world in general. That should be good enough, despite a few dissenters believing differently.<p>Second, the study linked does not disagree with the consensus at all! All the study claims, is that a small portion of the population has not benefited from free trade. With any substantive public policy, this will <i>always</i> be the case. Imagine if California declared tomorrow that only people who&#x27;ve lived in CA for 5 years can work as programmers. Such a policy would be horrendously bad for Americans and Californians in general. But it sure would make life great for a small number of unemployed programmers who are currently living in California.<p>And so it is with free trade as well. It may benefit some and not benefit others, but the overall economic benefits far outweigh the costs, both for Americans and for the world in general. Even when considering those not benefiting from globalization, we can and should help them better by using the increased economic rewards that come from free trade, to build a better social safety net and education/training program for the unemployed. That would the positive step forward, not walking down the destructive path of protectionism.",1454090105

Why does every 24-year old have to be changing the world?<p>Imagine you have a 2x2 matrix where the x-axis is positive value added to the world and the y-axis magnitude of impact. You want your job to be in the top right corner, high impact, high value added to the world but there&#x27;s two ways to get there. You could do something that has high value but low impact like working at a non-profit in DC helping with excel spreadsheets or whatever, you&#x27;re delivering value to the world but making a very small impact. The other approach is that you could learn how to build a large scalable system for delivering a solution to millions of people first. Maybe you&#x27;re making the 100th best photo sharing app and it will never add large value to the world, but you&#x27;re learning how to deliver impactful solutions you just need to figure out how to deliver real value. I&#x27;m not sure why there&#x27;s a bias against the second approach. I lived in DC for five years and most of my friends are doing less interesting things than my friends in SF. Someone who gets experience at a startup that builds interesting technology but never takes off could be the next CTO of a political campaign for all you know.<p>Also, it&#x27;s a complete myth that San Francisco is expensive to live in. You can leave cheap or expensive in any city. SF has a culture where being poor is totally cool. Everyone gets it, you&#x27;re in tech you&#x27;re an entrepreneur etc... There&#x27;s no pressure to go to nice restaurants for social status like there is in New York. I spend much less money in SF than I did living in DC just because of the lifestyle I&#x27;m living. Buying a house in SF is impossible due to the insane prices, but it&#x27;s really not that bad living in an apartment here.<p>I don&#x27;t think people are spoiled here, I think your perceptions are off.

The first half of the day and the second half of the day, this gives me two discrete time periods where I can do work and I like to take a bike ride in between because I can think about the problems, and then not have to go to the gym later in the day. When I was working for a company in DC there was no way I could have left at 2:00 to take an hour bike ride, even if that&#x27;s how I work best. I think it&#x27;s ridiculous to say that people working in their optimal workflows makes them spoiled.<p>And again, it takes probably 3 years to become a high-quality engineer. So I&#x27;m not sure what you would want coding bootcamp graduates to do after 3 months, get together and talk about how hopeless life is? I&#x27;m glad that people are getting into the industry, the only way you&#x27;re going to get better is by getting real world experience. So what someone with 8-months experience isn&#x27;t a great engineer yet? By continuing to get better over the next couple years he will become a better engineer and then be able to add significant value to the world, I&#x27;m not sure why you would want to discourage developers from perfecting their craft. This would be like heckling a Med School student for not being a great doctor yet.",1454090045

Cutting edge radar tech involves transmitting in way that is very very hard to detect.

The radar receiver then relies on a massive, literally heavy, computer system to differentiate the returns mathematically from the background.

They, looking down at the ground, see a much noisier background than those looking up at them against the sky.<p>Also, much work is being done on very long wavelength radars, with the possibility that an aircraft might not be able to carry a dish large enough to detect the incoming signal while remaining stealthy.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-frequency_radar"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-frequency_radar</a>",1454089028

I see a &quot;planet Japan&quot; scenario in which global central banks are zero-bound for decades, if not &quot;forever&quot;. Rapid growth is over. There are no more frontiers and birth rates are stabilizing. From an ecological point of view the stabilization of birth rates is good, but it basically breaks all the economic assumptions of the past 250+ years. A heavily leveraged credit economy does not work without fairly rapid growth, and until the economy is fundamentally restructured toward something built for a more steady-state mode of operation we&#x27;ll have to hack it by constantly printing money to prevent deflationary collapse.<p>The only thing that might change this is something like the opening of the final frontier-- space. But in that case I&#x27;m not sure if it would... distances between say Earth and Mars are so vast that any Martian economy would effectively be a separate entity. It might experience rapid growth but I&#x27;m not sure if that would translate over here. The Homeworld might still be like Japan-- a zero-bound no-growth economy.<p>I suppose an AI explosion that wasn&#x27;t destructive might change things too by creating a lot of new non-corporeal economic entities, but we&#x27;re well off into sci-fi land here.<p>Edit: I don&#x27;t necessarily mean that all forms of &quot;growth&quot; are over. We could still have tremendous growth in knowledge, technological capability, standard of living, and some amount of economic growth. But heavily leveraged inflationary credit economics requires <i>crazy exponential growth</i> in an absolute sense. Without crazy growth it breaks, and the only way to keep it nominally running is to pump money into it to prevent cascading default.<p>In a sense I think the &quot;pop Austrians&quot; are right that the present system is broken, but they&#x27;ve historically had the failure mode exactly wrong. The failure mode is not hyperinflation-- it&#x27;s hyper<i>deflation</i> that&#x27;s permanently held at bay by money printing (&quot;Japan&quot;). That&#x27;s because pop Austrians don&#x27;t get the money multiplier. Almost all money in circulation is credit/debt, not M1. You&#x27;d have to print <i>absurd</i> amounts of money and make sure it&#x27;s distributed more widely than banks to cause a non-localized hyperinflation in a credit economy. (Localized hyperinflation is possible due to bubbles but these usually collapse.)<p>Of course another way of keeping the illusion alive is to pump up localized credit bubbles repeatedly. These give the illusion to certain sectors or regions that the economy is still growing the way it should... for a while. But then they pop and you need another round of money printing to prevent hyperdeflation. Rinse and repeat. Meanwhile these bubbles distort the price structure of the economy, such as by making housing ridiculous or driving certain commodities crazy.",1454088472

This comes with unlimited uses of the buses and trains for an entire month. Let&#x27;s say you work twenty days (four weeks) a month, with a trip each way. That amortizes to $2 a trip, less if you also use your pass for personal trips on weekends.<p>Lyft costs me about $11 on average to get me between home and work. If I were to take Lyft to and from work every day for a month, again assuming twenty working days a month, I&#x27;d be paying about $440 a month. That&#x27;s not $4 more; it&#x27;s $9 more. That&#x27;s 5.5 <i>times</i> how much I&#x27;d be paying for public transport. Again, that&#x27;s not counting using it for personal trips on weekends (here, the minimum is $5.70, including the trust & safety fee).<p>If Uber/Lyft is only $4 more than a bus in SF, then buses are way expensive there.",1454088392

Please do keep in mind no system is perfect, 100% reliability is a dream we all strive to attain, and even with Parse, I&#x27;ve read several reports on this very thread of instances of less than perfect reliability, iffy technical support, and so on. Anecdotal sure, but still.<p>That said: the app sends basic notifications when in-app, user-initiated events of interest occur.<p>The server code is PHP, based off of this fantastic little tutorial: <a href=""http://www.raywenderlich.com/32963/apple-push-notification-services-in-ios-6-tutorial-part-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.raywenderlich.com/32963/apple-push-notification-s...</a><p>I modified and use the code in the simplest possible way:<p>I created the API layer using my wonderful form builder software (<a href=""https://www.rackforms.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.rackforms.com</a>). Yup, it&#x27;s form software flexible enough to write endpoints. Check it out : )<p>The app sends simple GET requests to my server, which are in turn handled by the API job. If a notification is required, the API INSERT&#x27;s a record into a MySQL table called push_queue.<p>The magic, I suppose, happens with a constantly running PHP script called push.php. This guy&#x27;s monitored by a simple cron job that checks for its running status every minute. if it&#x27;s down, cron automatically restarts the script. The notifications are not time-sensitive that 1 minute delays are a deal breaker, and of course any sent during that time are handled automatically when the script restarts.<p>APN Feedback is handled by a second one-the-hour cron job, which calls a simple script called feedback.php. A touch of code was added to deal with the core user&#x27;s device token being removed for &quot;followers&quot; of that user.<p>Three Key Takeaways:<p>1. The entire server setup part took me about 5 hours, API code (which we&#x27;d need to write regardless) not withstanding. The biggest hurdle was the cron stuff, I shall never forget cron -v cron! Using a third-party service would have been almost the same time, I&#x27;d imagine. The best part is <i>future</i> projects will literally be counted in the minutes for start to finish notification server duties.<p>2. I got to use a language I adore (PHP), and learned a bunch with others I was quite new too (shell scripting, cron, etc).<p>3. Finally: No app is guaranteed success. I know many of these services have/had! generous free tiers, but after my first app (<a href=""http://www.skipcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skipcast.net</a>) and its frankly lousy performance, fool me once indeed.<p>If, by some <i>miracle</i>, this new app gains traction, sure, I&#x27;ll consider a third party. Until then, I&#x27;ll do it my self thank you very much.<p>In all -- a wonderful experience that I&#x27;m keen to tweak and learn more from at deployment time.",1454088159

Lay offs mean the loss of institutional knowledge, team experience, internal quality standards, business relationships, inter-team relationships etc. etc. etc. that let them get things done. The new teams will be riding any technical capital left behind by the old guard for a while but I&#x27;ll predict it&#x27;ll run into problems by the 5yr mark. Costs will skyrocket as projects take more time, work processes have to be rebuilt, relationships start from scratch, etc.<p>In terms of the bottom line, it looks good now, but they&#x27;re going to be paying for it later. Either in higher costs to the contractors to fulfill projects OR paying consultants and internal teams absurd money to fix technical debt. It will happen. It&#x27;s cost shifting.<p>Edit: The other thing I forgot to add is loss of ownership. Shifting IT/development staff to contractors is going to decrease the sense of ownership in the project which means the level of care and concern about the success of the project are going to decline. Yes, it&#x27;s an intangible and an important one. If I own something and feel like my work on it is necessary for success, I&#x27;ll put in the work to do it right and set it up for success. Contractors will build to the contract and everything else is an add-on that costs more.

It proves nothing.  Attempts to use them to enforce draconian measures to elevate a class in the name of equality could just as easily backfire.<p>The other day, I saw a FB post from an old acquaintance about how racial economic equality needs to be mandated by law for minorities.  To which I replied, &quot;Yeah, Asians and Jews have it rough these days&quot;.<p>Astonishingly I was told Asians and Jews are not minorities (news to me).  Apparently, minority is code word for being black (also news to me).  To which I responded, &quot;yeah Jay Z really has it rough these days&quot;.<p>Unfortunately, my point was lost on this poor soul.  In his attempt to &quot;recognize his white privilege&quot; he fell into the Black == Poor trap and when Black != Poor it&#x27;s just an anomaly.  Sorry, but I call that racist.<p>The fact that Asians are generally a successful minority in the US has no bearing on a poor Asian person.<p>We need to elevate all the down trodden.

For example, he mentions how when we talk about a River or a Stream, we are not really talking about an object, because there is no section you can block off and say &quot;hey this is the river&quot; due to it changing moment by moment.  Yet, for convenience we use the conventional term &quot;river&quot; and it&#x27;s understood.  He also has this one line &quot;the great thing about a hammock is that you can lay in one with your eyes closed and no one will bother you because they think you&#x27;re sleeping.&quot;  He totally helped me wake up to the way a coder can really live a fulfilling life, and how the organization/ideation/creation of a digital experience (&quot;application&quot;) can happen (and in fact, happens better) away from the computer.  Without distraction, with your own balance, it&#x27;s much easier to focus ones mind.

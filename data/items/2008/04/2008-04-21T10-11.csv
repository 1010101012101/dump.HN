Once upon a time, companies made a lot of money selling Unixes, and for a period of time, there were commercial web servers.",1208775459

169274,comment,168636,169175,0,0,marvin,,,"Yes, there was. Or rather, there were indications that the Wii would get very popular.<p>I was in the camp of ""the Wii is definitely going to be successful"", but the market at large obviously wasn't. From what I heard at the time, the Nintendo DS was very successful in ""niche markets"" (or ""casual gamers"", choose the label that suits you), which could be taken as an indication that the Wii, with its promised novel control scheme, would be very popular at least among non-gamers. For contrarian investing, there were a lot of things pointing towards Nintendo being undervalued in early 2005. The prevalent opinion of ""graphics capabilities is the most important aspect of a computer game"" and ""gamers want predictability, not a novel control scheme"" and ""Nintendo sales have been falling since the NES"" should have set off lots of red lights among people who actually play games.<p>Market-leading is actually an irrelevant label in this regard, the important thing is that Nintendo released a console that made them more profitable than they were. In sales, the GameCube did about as well as the XBOX..not the market leader by a factor of 6, but definitely not something that would kill the company by itself. Any console doing better than that would drive up the stock price of Nintendo (""break the negative trend canal in sales"", as an annoying stock market analyst would say)",1208775144

Sure, you're going to learn some stuff you didn't know, but top MBA programs are aimed at people who were in an industry for a couple of years and have experience. The purpose, learning wise, is to fine-tune your skills. You should go after an MBA mostly for the networking opportunities, not the learning opportunities.",1208774927

I see a lot of non-IT people that to solve their everyday work tasks need to write code even if they don't realize it very well. Currently the mainstream application to do it is... excel. An environment where people can write code almost without realizing it to solve specific problems can make the difference.",1208773993

However, lately there is a bright light on the horizon: social networks analysis should provide for lots of opportunities to run some interesting algorithms. You could always start with the Netflix Challenge (not sure what interests you).<p>Also many people seem to make shitloads of money with ""ad opmtimization software"", tools for people to help them optimize their spending on ads. OK, that is ads again, but I think an area where you could run wild with algorithms.<p>What about image analysis? Google doesn't translate images yet...",1208773655

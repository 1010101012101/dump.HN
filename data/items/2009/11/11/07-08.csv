934860,comment,933449,934828,0,0,Silhouette,,,"> I think what you're paying for is convenience.<p>Not really.<p>Convenience would be paying for a font and then using it on my web site, just the way I do with photos, icons, and other such resources.<p>Convenience is not jumping through hoops to integrate with an external service of unknown reliability, understanding non-trivial legal agreements with an industry infamous for trying to screw its legitimate customers, and paying more in a single year for font-as-a-service than I pay for permanent use of a font today just so I can legally use the font on a web site in plain text form instead of via images.<p>Incidentally, I notice that have mentioned elsewhere in this discussion that image replacement technologies are likely to violate the licensing terms of fonts. As far as I'm aware, there haven't been any significant test cases yet in this area in any major western jurisdictions, and the legalities are far from clear, because the font foundries can only protect their rights up to the extent that copyright law grants them. Copyright law incorporates concepts such as fair use (or your local equivalent). Moreover, in some jurisdictions, the design of a font is not subject to copyright at all, only the specific description (the font files being treated as software for this purpose). Even if the font foundries would like to limit your right to buy a font, put it on a server, and have the server generate renderings of specific text in that font, it's not entirely clear what their legal basis for doing so might be in unfavourable jurisdictions, including the US.",1257926150

934834,comment,934375,934375,0,0,Silhouette,,,"It's interesting that everyone commenting so far has picked up on the auto-documentation issue.<p>The main value of these tools, IMHO, is in their ability to present a high-level overview of the code and support drilling down to find the relevant parts for the task at hand, not as a substitute for just reading comments in the code once you've found it. In fact, one of the worst aspects of many auto-documentation tools is the way they obfuscate comments that would otherwise have been written in plain text. Seriously, Javadoc, why do I have to write a <p> between each paragraph just so you can lay the comments out properly in HTML?<p>To improve the scannability of auto-generated documentation, top of my wish list would be an ""important"" flag you could put on the key types, functions, etc. Existing tools typically have no sense of priority in the way that a human writer would, giving equal weight to the top-level function that implements an important algorithm and each of a dozen trivial utility functions. Then you wind up with dozens of mostly irrelevant details obscuring the few key points of interest.<p>The other thing I really wish they'd support is much better grouping of related information. If a bunch of functions and types would naturally be of interest at the same time, then they should be listed together or otherwise associated in the documentation. Most auto-documentation tools suck at this, and even those that provide some facilities to do it tend to fall into the obfuscation trap I mentioned earlier.",1257925017

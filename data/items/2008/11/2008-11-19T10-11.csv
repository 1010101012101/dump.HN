He was doing the blogging/article thing back before everyone was doing it, and it takes some smarts to be the first. He also kept it up on a regular schedule, and that needs some discipline.<p>So people like 37signals had a good pinch of luck thrown in their pot, but Joel, I believe, actually got to the top rung of the internet food chain by persistence and hard work.",1227090879

The top of the atmosphere is usually marked as 120 kilometers up.  Let's say you can build a tower <i>one hundred times</i> that tall, around 10,000 kilometers high.   You've only reduced the speed needed by your electromagnetic accelerator from 11 km/sec to 7 km/sec.  That's still like 15,000 miles per hour.<p>I'm all for dreaming big, but the other ways of leaving the earth are better.",1227090718

369350,comment,368985,369253,0,0,patio11,,,"They've redefined ""struggle with hunger"" to mean ""has experienced food insecurity"".  Food insecurity is assessed by asking a 10 question instrument.  (There are shorter and longer versions.)  Here it is:<p><a href=""http://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefing/FoodSecurity/surveytools/ad2008.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefing/FoodSecurity/surveytools/ad...</a><p>Typical question:<p>""In the last 12 months, since last November, did you ever cut the size of your meals or skip meals because there wasn't enough money for food?""<p>If you answer in the affirmative for 3 questions or more, you're food insecure.<p>I answered the test honestly.  I score 3 points and have, accordingly, ""low food security"" which is reported as ""food insecure"" (i.e. struggles with hunger).<p>Don't feel too bad for me -- I am a professional engineer and single 20-something.  Life is fine, thank you.<p>At the moment, I have $200 in my pocket and nothing in my checking account.  If the $200 does not last until payday (the 25th), I will eat ramen and rice instead of pizza and ribs.  This happens a handful of times a year.  (I could have the ribs if I raided my emergency fund or used credit but, really, swapping expensive for cheap for a day or three just doesn't strike me as an emergency.)<p>I don't think most advocates would consider me food insecure.<p>They probably would have when I was growing up.  My family had some rough times, money was tight once in a while, things got stretched to last another day, once in a while we went without juiceboxes.  It wasn't a Dickensian tale of horror, but it is pretty squarely within the intended meaning of ""food insecure"".  Which convinces me the metric is not worth as much as some people think it is.",1227089970

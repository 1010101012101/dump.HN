There are dozens of anecdotes about people who lose a serious amount of weight, hit their target, and then slowly regain all the weight because that&#x27;s what happens when you&#x27;re 160 pounds and you go back to eating junk.

It&#x27;s governed by a control loop within the brain. In a healthy person, appetite adjusts to compensate for calorie surplus or deficit. We have an epidemic because that control loop is getting damaged. People have a hard time discussing this because they treat it as a moral issue. But it&#x27;s clear that recruiting our frontal cortex to count calories should not be necessary -- every mammal needs to automatically maintain homeostasis, and does so just fine in its natural environment.<p>And &quot;calories burned per lb bodyweight&quot; is also not a simple constant. It has been observed swinging significantly. A starving person&#x27;s metabolism will slow dramatically to conserve energy. An overfed (healthy) person&#x27;s metabolism will ramp up and favor burning the excess over storing it.<p>So of course we can&#x27;t cheat thermodynamics, and of course eating less matters.

6003171,comment,6001827,6002401,1,0,VLM,,,"So... eat a carrot?<p>I will admit there is a societal trend to just relabel high meat low carb atkins type diets as paleo, and be done with it.  That doesn&#x27;t mean the paleo diet is &quot;eat organic steaks every night&quot;.<p>As a programmer/hacker community the best analogy I can give is my impression of a venn diagram of a atkins/low carb type diet is the circle for the diet mostly contains meat and not much else.  And the venn for a paleo diet also contains a small circle for meat, along with a whoppin big circle for fruit/veg/nuts.  True both don&#x27;t have grains/beans, and neither are vegetarian, but thats about it for similarity.<p>Another interesting analogy is the ideal stereotypical atkins low carb meal probably is a steak as per your example.  The stereotypical paleo meal is probably a big ole salad full of veggies with a normal sized grilled chicken breast on top (not one of those mutant ones the size of your forearm).<p>Finally having fooled around with both diets a low carb ketone mode diet is super sensitive to what you eat; highly disciplined.  Eat one apple and you&#x27;ve ruined days of work getting into ketone mode.  On the other hand a paleo type diet has more to do with priorities and general trends.  Always have more bags from the produce aisle in the cart than bags from the breakfast cereal aisle, that type of thing.  I had a bowl of ice cream at a celebration for my son last night; under a paleo diet that&#x27;s fine, once in a while... just don&#x27;t eat that kind of stuff every day (or every week).  Its not good for you.  I drank a beer last weekend too.<p>Finally grains and legumes will make you fat then die, assuming you get enough of them (not starvation mode).  If life&#x27;s worth living, find a way not to fail at it.  Right back to the first line, eat a carrot or something.",1373226796

While I truly believe that for weight loss, 2000 calories of fast food is the same as 2000 calories of lean protein, fruits and veg, after the period of strict control (the &quot;diet&quot;) the person eating 2000 calories of fast food has not done much to truly change their habits and mindset.<p>I, personally, have accomplished a lot by intermittent fasting (didn&#x27;t know it had a name until later, to me it was just about not eating as much during the day in favor of a bigger dinner) and learning that it&#x27;s OK to feel not-full. And to learn the difference between hunger and feeling not-full. I went from 210 to 170 and lost 55 pounds!! of fat during the process. I have a big dinner (usually 50% of my daily caloric intake) and dessert every night (another 20%). That&#x27;s complimented by a lunch of around 25% of my daily intake. Very infrequent snacking. No breakfast, even on Gym days, and no soft drinks only water, aside from alcoholic beverages.",1373224921

6003062,comment,6002595,6002595,31,0,onetimeonly,,,"Source: at 17 I was running a black-hat hacker collective and had, through a series of bad choices, got pretty deep into the &#x27;real-world&#x27; side of that business: fraud. The day after my 19th birthday my house was raided by the US Secret Service and the UK Serious Organised Crime Agency in a worldwide coordinated swoop that took in dozens of loosely affiliated people. I have since completely rebuilt my life, so I don&#x27;t mind anonymously sharing this.<p>Stealing an identity is trivially easy. Society revolves around relationships of trust between organisations and individuals, and the trust runs amazingly deep. The basic information you need to do it is publicly available: date of birth, mother&#x27;s maiden name (on the birth certificate and parents&#x27; marriage certificate respectively, copies available on request from the records office).<p>Carrying out the ID theft takes resources and balls. You&#x27;ll need to be able to manufacture ID documents, or have access to someone who does. Nowadays you can buy them on one of the onion dark markets. Generally you want a driving license, as this is the easiest to forge form of ID that gets you complete access. Banks, governments, etc. will accept it.<p>Sadly, making driving licenses is not too hard - document security is pretty weak. You&#x27;ll need to make yourself some ultra-high resolution scans, trace the entire design in illustrator, and then get hold of some printing equipment. You usually want to print on teslin (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teslin_(material)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teslin_(material)</a>), and laminate with a high-quality laminator. UV seals can be easily replicated by hacking an epson printer to use modified cartridges with UV pigments injected into them. Holograms can also be replicated by dusting your laminate with interference pigments and reverse-printing in clear ink to fix the design. It can all be done on commodity hardware.<p>With a driving license and dob/mother&#x27;s maiden name you can then access a huge amount of someone&#x27;s sensitive information, and more importantly, control their relationships with organisations. I don&#x27;t want this to be a tutorial, so I&#x27;ll simply say that with several more pieces of information you can take out credit in someone&#x27;s name, control their existing accounts (e.g. by adding yourself as a new cardholder), or start causing trouble in their name.<p>A final word of caution. While it&#x27;s easy to get people&#x27;s information from government records offices, it&#x27;s even easier to get it from them personally. We used to call people and social engineer them into giving us their DOB, bank account numbers, secret words, etc. Don&#x27;t be stupid with your information: never tell someone your data down the telephone unless <i>you called them</i>. Oh, and if you&#x27;re thinking of committing identity fraud, think again. It&#x27;s not hard to pull off, but you&#x27;re not smart enough to do it without getting caught. Everyone gets caught in the end.",1373224755

Berlin, while having a lot of startups, is not the center of the &quot;real&quot; software industry. I recommend taking a serious look at companies in the Rhein-Main-Neckar region. This region has a cluster of big software firms, such as SAP, SoftwareAG and the companies working on software for the financial industry (Frankfurt), as well as Technical Universities (these are the ones that produce CS graduates).<p>Be warned, however, that you won&#x27;t find anything comparable to SV in Germany. And I have to admit that there is also a problem regarding startups: The largest cluster of startups is in Berlin, but most of the money in the software biz is in West Germany. Btw, please don&#x27;t get scammed by the Samwers.<p>Experience is definitely a plus, but probably more with the more &quot;traditional&quot; software companies than with the startups. Many German startups live off fresh degrees and high hopes (in the sense that they are founded by people out of the University), with all the positive and negative side-effects that this brings.<p>With regards to language, I&#x27;d say English and a willingness to learn German should suffice. Most of the software people already know enough English to work with them, and some corporations that operate internationally even mandate some degree of English usage. A few more rules of thumb: If the company is big or works in an innovative field, English should be all you need. If, on the other hand, it is located in a rural place or in East Germany, there might be problems.<p>These are of course generalizations. In any case, learning German will be helpful, even if it is only to facilitate the interactions with your surroundings outside work.",1373224696

This is a great way for career advancement - ever notice managers are generally better-dressed (ignoring Zuckerberg, the exception to this rule)?<p>What I recommend to get started is go to a consignment/thrift store such as Goodwill and liberally buying cheap clothes that fit decently well. For shirts this mainly just means ensuring the shoulder crease lines up with the &quot;angle&quot; at the end of your shoulder. Take them all to an alterations store and have the nice lady fit everything for you. This will be the most expensive part of this whole endeavor. As a result you&#x27;ll get a better feel for the types of clothes that work best for you as well as how clothes are supposed to fit, all for relatively little upfront investment.<p>Also get nice shoes.

In theory, you want someone who was born in one state and died in another to ensure that the birth certificate won&#x27;t be stamped as &quot;deceased&quot;.<p>One thing to be avoided is to scan news stories of people who died in well-publicized accidents: if others have applied for the birth certificate (having the same idea in mind) too many times, a certificate may get flagged as suspect and extra scrutiny be applied to requests for it.<p>Note that instructions for applying for birth certificates are rather lax: <a href=""http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/vs/reqproc/certified_copy.shtm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/vs/reqproc/certified_copy.shtm</a>. Given today&#x27;s software, it&#x27;s trivial to fake a &quot;photocopy&quot; of an ID . You&#x27;d want the birth certificate sent to a mail drop (<a href=""http://www.maildropsearch.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maildropsearch.com/</a>) and have it forwarded on to another address for added security.<p>Once you have the birth certificate, you then start obtaining &quot;supporting&quot; documentation, such as library cards, or maybe register for a local community college and get a student ID (those are often easy to get and are readily accepted as valid ID).<p>Eventually you&#x27;ll want to apply for a state-issued ID card. Some states have stricter requirements than others. There was a time when you could apply for one with a library card and your birth certificate, but those times seem to be long-gone. States will generally require a social security number, too.<p>Applying for the social security number was always the tricky bit. One source recommended altering your &quot;photocopied&quot; documents to show that you were under-age and then apply by mail (the Social Security card doesn&#x27;t list your age, after all). If you are ready to retire, file to correct the &quot;bookkeeping error&quot; that incorrectly lists your age. I am suspicious of whether or not this would work.<p>As you can see, the process is essentially one of building momentum of starting with small, easy-to-acquire documents and working your way up the chain. It was a long, slow, laborious process and it used to be that acquiring an alternate identity wasn&#x27;t necessarily illegal so long as you did not due so for purposes of fraud. Today, I believe it&#x27;s illegal in all fifty state.<p>That being said, I wouldn&#x27;t try this today (hell, I never would have tried it when it was still feasible). It&#x27;s worth several penal slaps on the wrist.<p>I&#x27;m sure that a cunning person can take the plan above and work out how to acquire a new identity today, but I&#x27;d not recommend it.<p><i></i>Update<i></i>: or if it&#x27;s a passport you want, there are alternatives: <a href=""http://www.overseas-exile.com/2013/07/buying-second-passport.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.overseas-exile.com/2013/07/buying-second-passport...</a>.

6003007,comment,6000815,6000815,1,0,jervisfm,,,"This is an interesting concept but I am wondering how alieving relates to both believing and knowing in general. Is an alieve just a type of belief that is unjustified but hard to ignore or get rid of ?

A person watching a sad movie may believe that the characters are completely fictional, but their aliefs may lead them to cry nonetheless. A person who is hesitant to eat fudge that has been formed into the shape of feces, or who exhibits reluctance in drinking from a sterilized bedpan may believe that the substances are safe to eat and drink, but may alieve that they are not.<p>and we remove the verb &#x27;alieve&#x27; and only work with the verbs &#x27;to believe&#x27; and &#x27;to know&#x27; :<p>For example, a person standing on a transparent balcony may <i>know</i> that they are safe, but <i>believe</i> that they are in danger.

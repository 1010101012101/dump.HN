In the social sciences, not always.<p>> How about, limiting the visibility of comments to a subset of the community.<p>That would mean the system isn't a single system any more. Apart from making the system two or more systems, it's undemocratic and probably counterproductive.<p>Consider the classic example -- astrophysicist Jim Peebles had an idea about the Big Bang, that there should be a residual ""echo"" of the original event, ""audible"" in the present universe, in the form of a background radiation with a specific temperature that was relatively easy to compute. Peebles realized the radiation should appear in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and it should seem to be coming from everywhere (highly uniform).<p>Meanwhile, physicists Penzias & Wilson over at Bell Labs had a microwave dish with an annoying noise they couldn't get rid of. They scrubbed away bird droppings, they adjusted the front end amplifier, nothing helped, and it didn't matter which way they pointed the dish -- the signal seemed to be coming from everywhere.<p>Penzias & Wilson called Peebles and asked hum what he though the noise might be. Peebles told them, hung up the phone, and said, ""We've been scooped."" Penzias & Wilson won the Nobel Prize.<p>Now that's feedback.

Cheap upgrade and it's valid on all the computers you own. None of this non-transferable, expensive license per computer in your household crap.

Is it based on how fast you download the data once it's available, how much data you request divided by how long it takes them to retrieve it (3.5-4.5 hours), or the size of the archives you request for retrieval in a given hour?<p>This last case seems most plausible to me [6] -- that the retrieval rate is based solely on the rate of your requests.<p>In that case, the math would work as follows:<p>After uploading 3TB (3 * 2^40 bytes) as a single archive, your retrieval allowance would be 153.6 GB/mo (3TB * 5%), or 5.12 GB/day (3TB * 5% / 30).  Assuming this one retrieval was the only retrieval of the day, and as it's a single archive you can't break it into smaller pieces, your billable peak hourly retrieval would be 3072 GB - 5.12 GB = 3066.88 GB.<p>Thus your retrieval fee would be 3066.88 * 720 * .01 = $22081.535 (719x your monthly storage fee).<p>That would be a wake-up call for someone just doing some testing.<p>--<p>[1] <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/faqs/#How_will_I_be_charged_when_retrieving_large_amounts_of_data_from_Amazon_Glacier"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/faqs/#How_will_I_be_charged_wh...</a><p>[2] After paying that fee, you might be reminded of S4:
<a href=""http://www.supersimplestorageservice.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.supersimplestorageservice.com/</a><p>[3] How do you think this interacts with AWS Export?  It seems that AWS Export would maximize your financial pain by making retrieval requests at an extraordinarily fast rate.<p>[(edit) 4] Once you make a retrieval request the data is only available for 24 hours.  So even in the best case, that they charge you based on how long it takes you to download it (and you're careful to throttle accurately), the charge would be $920 ($0.2995/GB) -- that's the lower bound here.  Which is better, of course, but I wouldn't rely on it until they clarify how they calculate.  My calculations above represent an upper bound (""as high as"").  Also note that they charge separately for bandwidth out of AWS ($368.52 in this case).<p>[(edit) 5] Answering an objection below, I looked at the docs and it doesn't appear that you can make a ranged retrieval request.  It appears you have to grab an entire archive at once.  You can make a ranged GET request, but that only helps if they charge based on the download rate and not based on the request rate.<p>[(edit) 6] I think charging this way is more plausible because they incur their cost during the retrieval regardless of whether or how fast you download the result during the 24 hour period it's available to you (retrieval is the dominant expense, not internal network bandwidth).  As for the other alternative, charging based on how long it takes them to retrieve it would seem odd as you have no control over that.",1345560140

In another yesterday's news, on Reddit they are starting to build yet another online university.<p>Don't take me wrong, I actively search for information on the Internet, follow many tutorials and even wrote some. I absolutely advocate for researching something on the net before buying a book. But when it comes to university-like education, well, only Universities currently provide it.<p>Some months ago I looked for courses on iOS programming for a personal project. After following some video tutorials, HOWTOs on blogs, and even ""free courses"", the only thing that has really taught me anything has been Stanford's iOS course. And I can't even be sure if I learned everything, because nobody graded me.<p>If nobody is grading you (a professor, a tutor, a supervisor, a boss, a customer), how do you know if you education is correct?<p>""Online universities"" already exist. There is one very close to home[1] and its degrees are as accepted as any other regular university. The point is, you have to pay for them. You have to pay for the professors to prepare the courses, to correct the exams, to write material for you.<p>I would honestly love to hear from somebody who has powerful arguments which can support a free, high quality, online university-like studies. I just can't think of how that is possible.<p>Anything else is, at least, an abuse of the word ""University""<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/index.html</a>",1345559286

Having an extra collaborator in the model is asking for trouble - there's nothing about a User that requires it to know anything about emailing. It violates all kinds of design principles. Putting your logic for ""I should email the User when they sign up"" into the User model is using ""design by related words"".<p>In traditional Rails design, the controller is exactly the right place for this. Another option is a service layer of some kind, if you do that, e.g. a DCI context, or just another Plain-Ol-Ruby-Object that is in charge of the logic of signing up a user.<p>The best part of separating out the logical business sequence of signing up a user into its own object (I can see this method in my head, something like save_new_user, sign_in_user, queue_welcome_email) is that it becomes massively easier to test - you can just mock the various calls to its collaborators' public methods because they should all have unit tests.",1345559260

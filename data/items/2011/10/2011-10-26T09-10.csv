3157822,story,,,45,85,ian,"Ask HN: Why don't more UK graduates want to join start-ups?",,"Last May we organised a recruitment fair in London for UK hackers to meet local start-ups. YC companies included Lanyrd, Songkick, Tuxebo and Webmyd. It got more traction than we expected with hundreds of attendees. More details at www.siliconmilkroundabout.com<p>We announced a follow up event this Sunday that has had a strange response pattern. We've had thousands of registrations, but they're mostly from experienced developers rather than current students and recent graduates. My personal goal for the event is to help graduates see that there are more options out there than just the obvious banking/consulting/Google routes so I'm trying to make sure we also reach current students.<p>The event is free to attend, showcases 500+ roles at over 100 UK based start-ups from Mind Candy to Shazam but hasn't yet gotten real traction at universities across the UK despite hitting mailing lists, flyering etc.<p>Does anyone on hacker news have any ideas on how we could increase awareness of the event amongst current UK CS students? Do we have to take the event to campuses like the banks do with their milkrounds?<p>If you're a UK CS or engineering student have you heard about the event? If not what would have been the best way to reach you? What career options are more visible on campus (banks, Google etc)?<p>Thanks!

Criticizing Siri as less than useful in its current iteration is like criticizing WIMP as less than useful 20 years ago.<p>The fact that Siri is UI and not a feature is exactly why Microsoft and Google and many other service providers should worry about it - it commoditizes the back-end and creates a new interaction point around which Apple, and currently only Apple, is creating business value. Both Microsoft and Google have technology cards to play in this area, but neither has deployed a new user-interface in the way that Apple recently has. I would expect them to each go after a solid play in this area, in the same way that Microsoft responded to the Wii with Kinect - with a strong competitive urgency. Whether or not they are successful in their response is something we'll know in time.",1319623090

I would recommend going to the best of the best professional you can find though, I had a terrible experience with one psychotherapist that kept me from trying it again for more than 7 years. Even if you think your case is just ""mild"" (not that this applies to you) doesn't mean that seeking help is wrong, after all, you go to the doc if you have acne, or other things that are not life threatening.<p>I have been diagnosed with bipolar I at age 29, and while I was able to come back out an extreme manic + delusional phase without hurting anyone nor myself too much, I now know the terrible danger that lies there. I selfmedicated with various drugs since age 13, and after having found a substance that stabilized me in a reasonable amount, I decided to go see a psychiatrist. Lucky as I am, some pills and a round of psychoeducation fixed almost all of it.<p>At least I am not caught up in the cycle so much that I can't reflect on it and follow the ""backup steps"" when I need to (sports + friends + happy stuff when I spiral downward, more sleep, less socializing, less work when I am skyrocketing upwards). And I am able to see the value in leading a boring life, doing stuff you like and getting paid for it, and someday in the not too far away future having a house and a garden and kids and just riding a smooth ride at 50 km/h. Not missing the highs and not fearing the lows.<p>The key thing to all of this is though: the pills did it. After 29 years I am suddenly able to a) have a grasp what a normal life is / can be, b) recognize my own feelings without being completely overwhelmed by them, c) realizing that even just thinking about suicidal thoughts is a sign that something is wrong.<p>Of course this is all terribly subjective, but the closest you can come to objectivity (hah!) is getting professional help.

I think this is a harbinger for what iOS and Android will become.<p>There is definitely some maturing required to occur on the Android side and I think this is represented by the continuing hesitation of pay app developers on the platform. The article didn't shed light on the revenue figures but rather concentrated on downloads only, which as per your experience can be misleading. Additionally the split between paid/unpaid and the average revenue on paid apps would be the meat necessary to attract developers. I feel this may be a long-running issue for Android as one of its primary attractions for users is the low acquisition cost, thus it's marketed to a consumer who is less likely to spend. (Seconded by the high piracy rates on Android.) This creates a cyclical issue, the android app store quality becomes diluted by lack of signature apps, so consumers become less likely to purchase apps from a store where they are accustomed to receiving poorer quality applications. So developers don't consider Android the first-platform of choice, thus perpetuating the cycle. For consumers buying become a risk exercise, thus pushing more favour to the ease of piracy, and developers to ultimately consider the platform secondary.<p>Actual Android penetration is also difficult to gauge, while iOS has predictable hardware, retail and pricing. Android-based phones have received significant sales promotion offers (e.g. 2 for 1 is quite common), the models available fit across a price and technical spectrum from top notch to crappy-phone-that-can't-do-much. I believe this leads to why app downloads are lower per device. (When the randomness of consumers should yield a similar app-download figure, perhaps even slightly skewed towards Android due to the larger amount of test and free software available.) Instead we see Android lagging despite having significantly more devices in the wild. (This doesn't build confidence for quality developers to make Android a priority destination.)<p>On the other hand Google's priority is to ensure ubiquity (whether good or bad phones), such that their ad revenue based services don't miss the smartphone revolution. Their strategy for this is effective, it's reminiscent of windows vs mac os. In the end iOS isn't Android's problem - Apple's iOS strategy will always be selling less units than Android, but as we've seen in computer manufacturers it may not be about how many you sell, but rather how profitable it is to sell at all.<p>Side note:
Unfortunately for everyone, this means there will always be Android/iOS flame wars in the same way we've come to expect Windows/Mac OS/Linux flame threads. The plus side is that innovation will be continuous for both platforms.",1319621498

Even towards the middle of season 3, when Walt finds himself needing to protect himself from Jessie, he still has more than just protection in mind. He really does care for Jessie. What else would explain him not deciding to outright have him murdered? Saul, after all, does mention the possibility of having to explore ""other options."" At that suggestion, Walt scoffs at Saul and instead proceeds to offer Jessie the partnership.

The one day I chose to ignore HN in order to make a dent in my mountain of work and this article gets posted.<p>For what it's worth, I agree wholeheartedly with the majority of the article. Recruiters who focus on start-ups are wasting their own time as well as the start-up's time. Yes there are a huge number of start-ups hiring and yes some will engage recruiters but the vast majority don't have the budget.<p>I would happily wager a months salary on the fact that 99.9% of recruiters don't understand how a tech start-up works and even if they make the effort to learn, every start-up is different with their own individual challenges and quirks and it requires an immense amount of time and effort to truly understand what these companies need. No recruiter will invest that level of time. Instead they will throw a few CV's at the role and hope something sticks.<p>I'm giving a talk at Hacker News London tomorrow night and the topic is 'Recruiting for start-ups'. It's a brief talk on how to improve your chances of finding the right people for your start-up and how to keep them. At no point do I even attempt to suggest they engage a recruiter, in fact I strongly encourage them not to.",1319620883

Part of me wants this to suck, just so there are only iPhone and Android to worry about ever developing for, but this actually looks good enough to consider.<p>I looked at WP through BizSpark a little, and it looks easier to develop for than iOS or Android, at least for corporate apps.  It's possible RIM will lose out in the ""corporate owned/managed"" market to WP, especially if they can build in equivalent or better security and management tools.<p>If I were MS/Nokia, I'd heavily subsidize this in ways other than just reducing the retail price; maybe even go for a $799 retail MSRP but heavily discount through the carriers or through channels to $0-400.  You want the price to make it seem premium (or at least as good as a high-end Android or iPhone 4S), but they're the new entrant, so using price to promote the product might be a win.

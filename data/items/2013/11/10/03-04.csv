6705108,comment,6703034,6704293,3,0,richardjordan,,,"I think to the contrary that Brits, an Europeans in general are vastly more sensitive to the threat of nazi-style or communist-like government - and corporate - oppression than Americans who are, by and large, complacent on this topic despite all the anti-government rhetoric you hear. As a result governments can&#x27;t get away with as much because people watch closely. Combine this with the greater sense that the government runs the provision of critical services like healthcare and people have a better relationship with their government so fight over what matters, and there tends to be a good sense of what that is. Also the British political system is far more responsive to the electorate than is the US system which famously has less churn among elected officials than the old soviet politburo. This means that the electorate has more confidence in its ability to effect change.",1384055959

If you make it that easy, even if it&#x27;s just for the JSON stores, I know that maybe you can&#x27;t make it easy for relational tables, I will move my product to PostgreSQL in a heartbeat.<p>I have used and promoted PostgreSQL throughout my career, but I&#x27;m currently stuck with having to deliver HA in a product for redistribution to customers and Slony can&#x27;t cut it for our use cases, it&#x27;s too complicated.  I think the key is that we are a vendor and we need to provide a database with our products, so it&#x27;s not me that&#x27;s responsible for configuring HA, it&#x27;s our users.  And replication is what I&#x27;m concerned about 90% of the time, not necessarily horizontally scaling out (i.e. we&#x27;re not using sharding in 90% of our cases, we just need HA).",1384055747

It is a great change for programming novices<p>Douglas Crockford made a point in a recent interview[1] (not the first time, I&#x27;m sure) that this is exactly the wrong reason to keep doing things &quot;the way it&#x27;s always been&quot;. Other examples he mentions: line endings (CR/LF), integer overflow, short vs long. Big vs little endian would be another obvious example.<p>Fred Brooks (Mythical Man Month) calls this &quot;accidental complexity&quot;.<p>> [novices are] only part of Python&#x27;s audience, and probably won&#x27;t be the longest-lived part<p>By definition.

That means a certain article is going to gain traction, get people talking on social networking sites, and in turn seduce more people into wanting in on those discussions. But the people who aren&#x27;t in on these hacks are met with a dilemma: be a part of the in-crowd, or just go away. As it turns out, this human wanting to be in on what everyone else is talking about is very strong, so a lot of people end up buying it. For others, it&#x27;s the convenience factor of not having to google every article and find it that way... in both cases, a key force was the content not being totally unaccessible, but being there in some small way as a teaser. I should point out that it&#x27;s working out exceeding well for the NYTimes. WSJ has been doing it for a long time, and the Economist just recently started doing it too. I expect even more will soon follow. It&#x27;s an interesting and clever evolution of the freemium model in some ways.",1384052524

3719488,comment,3717903,3719318,3,0,FuzzyDunlop,,,"This is a huge annoyance for me, as is providing an example in the terms of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'.<p>PHP's manual is terrible for this. It's not just a naming problem, but a total failure to explain the purpose of that concept or function with a proper use-case.<p><pre><code>    class A {\n        public function a($a) {\n            $this->a = $a;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    class _A extends A {\n    }\n\n    class B {\n        public function b($b) {\n            $this->b = $b;\n        }\n    }\n\n    $foo = new A;\n    $bar = new _A;\n    $baz = new B;\n    \n    ....\n</code></pre>\nAnother thing is stuff like this:<p><pre><code>    Array.sort(function(a, b) {\n        return a - b;\n    });\n</code></pre>\nFirstly, if you're a beginner, that means absolutely nothing other than an array is being sorted. Secondly, if you do know what it is, it fails to explain what else you might be able to do other than sorting from lowest to highest.",1332068205

3719469,comment,3718812,3718892,2,0,steventruong,,,"I thought the same but in my experience, I've rarely, if ever, had the need to search for email. When I did (super rare), I found that the search function in gmail was mostly busted. Sometimes it would omit results for email that is clearly there that match specific queries or filters. I'd have to try several different methods and even manually going back at times to get the email in question. In the end, having it overloaded with email was more of a pain for those instances where I needed to find a specific email.<p>Sometime towards the end of last year, I decided to wipe my entire email record (which was a lot) and start from a clean slate. Since then, I made an effort to delete any unimportant emails instantly, file the important ones I think I may need to keep, and tag temp emails that needs to be there but would be deleted once they serve their purpose (for example, online orders for items shipped).<p>For several months now, I've managed to keep my entire email account under 50 emails. It makes managing it much easier and great for emails I would need. This of course is base on my habits. I never really have a need to pull up the majority of old emails and leaving it there is just unnecessary clutter (personal opinion).",1332067026

3719465,comment,3717715,3719226,4,0,telent,,,"> the focus is on the object rather than the process<p>From a business apps point of view, this is exactly it.  You might find that methods are subordinate to objects, but in the business domain itself, the objects themselves are manipulated by <i>processes</i>.  It's a whole other layer above the OO layer, and failure to realise this means you either end up with lots of FooManager classes, or you push overarching responsiblities back down into low-level objects that don't really want them, and find you have too much coupling and not enough Demeter<p>(Of course, you might be writing FooManager classes with this upper layer explicitly in mind - in which case fair enough and you'll probably like DCI.  But I think there's still a lot of mileage in plain ordinary functions that don't have to belong to anything)",1332066727

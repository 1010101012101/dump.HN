It&#x27;s like\ninvesting in a stock or commodity that&#x27;s increasing. I invested extra\ncash in a few stocks, including TSLA, while it was on the rise. This\ngave me a better ROI than holding USD or investing it in a CD or other\nlow interest rate account.<p>But as a borrower, deflation blows. If I borrow 100 BTC and the terms\nof the loan are that I have to pay back 100 BTC + 10 BTC as interest,\nbut the value of BTC has increased by another 10% I&#x27;m really paying\n21% interest on the loan.<p>But as a borrower, inflation rocks. If I borrow 100 USD and the terms\nof the loan are that I have to pay back 100 USD + 10 USD as interest,\nbut the value of USD has decreased by 10% I&#x27;m really paying 0%\ninterest on the loan (actually, I might be able to beat inflation and\ncome out ahead).<p>This goes back to what I mentioned in another thread [1] about buying\nand selling in either type of currency.<p>Let me hand wave some things, we&#x27;ll assume that the real value of an\nitem or ROI is static, and only the nominal value is changing with\ninflation or deflation.<p>Inflation: I borrow money to buy an item. I pay interest on the loan,\nand gain the benefit of having the item today rather than a year later\nwhen I would have saved up the cash. Over that year I pay off the\nloan, but with inflation I may get a discount of sorts on the item. If\ninflation is 10%, the nominal value is 10% higher the next year. If\nthe interest payment is less than 10% I&#x27;ve saved money. If it&#x27;s more\nthan 10%, hopefully there was a profit in having the item now rather\nthan later or I lost money.<p>Deflation: I borrow money to buy an item. I pay interest on the loan,\nand gain the benefit of having the item today rather than a year later\nwhen I would have saved up the cash. Over that year I pay off the\nloan, but with deflation I have an added cost. If deflation is 10%,\nthe nominal value is 10% lower the next year. If the interest payment\nis negative ~10%, I&#x27;ve saved money. If it&#x27;s higher, then hopefully\nthere was a profit in having the item now rather than later or I lost\nmoney.<p>In fact, that matrix is essentially the same. Borrowers win in\ninflation (or might), while lenders might lose (but it beats leaving\nthe cash under the mattress where it will lose value). Borrowers lose\nin deflation in most circumstances, while lenders win as long as\nborrowers don&#x27;t default too often. Lenders under deflation\nhave to be confident that the expected ROI of their loans will beat\nthe deflation rate, or they might as well leave the cash\nalone. Lenders under inflation are virtually guaranteed that\nreasonable loan practices (subprime mortgages being an example of\n<i>unreasonable</i> loan practices) will be better than sitting on the\ncash if the economy is otherwise stable.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6811101\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6811101</a>",1386014233

India could prevail in negotiating for carbon emission reductions elsewhere (the US, EU, Japan).  Technology transfers greatly increasing India&#x27;s GDP/bbl wouldn&#x27;t hurt either -- it&#x27;s presently around $400/bbl, the US sees $1000/bbl, most of Europe is in the $1500-$3000/bbl range.<p>2. Stunning advances in renewable, sustainable, and/or low-carbon energy technologies could allow for growth in India&#x27;s standard of living without additional carbon emissions.  I put the likelihood of this as low.<p>Long run:  there&#x27;s a balance of population <i>and</i> per-capita resource consumption.  The total sustainable rate is fixed.

I agree with you totally, however sometimes when the problem is a bug in another system and everything still seems completely rational this kind of knowledge is gold.<p>My story was a C# WPF application and certain events were not being unregistered.

It turns out that the function was an anonymous function (that was defined as x = {...};) The strangest thing is that the anonymous function had a reference to it and I had thought that the references were being compared for equality.<p>But it wasn&#x27;t being matched... So I recommended the inline declaration be changed to an actual static method and the comparison worked.

The good news is that we&#x27;ve got technology, science, and understanding now which we didn&#x27;t have 250 years ago, and the odds are very good that they&#x27;ll survive even a profound decline in industrial and economic capacity.

V8 has a global lock on all JS objects that prevent them from being passed between threads. The only way to allow threading is to serialize and deserialize the objects into new &quot;isolates&quot; (V8 language). V8 does this for some pretty obvious reasons, you wouldn&#x27;t really want to allow threading at the JS level in a browser, now would you.<p>You can use threads if you dive down into C++ land, but event then, you should have a really good reason for doing so, because if you&#x27;re only manipulating objects for processing you&#x27;re going to have to serialize into a C++ data-structure, process, and then serialize into a JS object. Threads in node are good for doing process intensive work that doesn&#x27;t require any two way input from the main event loop, otherwise it&#x27;s very unlikely to be worth your time or effort.<p>This is why fibers are kind of silly for node and is also why process intensive programs should most likely be avoided in node (with rare exception). Please use node for what it is good at; it&#x27;s a short lived connection proxy maven, and good at ancillary front-end work that requires complex state transitions (i.e. mobile). Working it into a monolithic stack is just asking for trouble and pain. No serious architect should consider it for a large monolithic rendering stack.",1386013877

My wife&#x27;s Seiki has more raw pixels than <i>two</i> of my 30&quot; monitors.  I admit that an ideal 50&quot; display would be OLED and concave, but I&#x27;ll keep those off my wish-list for the time being.  I don&#x27;t want the manufacturers to think I&#x27;m being unreasonable.  High-DPI and large form-factor seem reasonable for 2014.<p>I don&#x27;t like the bezels between monitors in a multi-monitor configuration.  I don&#x27;t like the low-DPI of my 30&quot; monitors.  And I certainly don&#x27;t like the price of the Dell U3011.<p>When you say you know people who <i>can&#x27;t handle</i> a 30&quot; monitor, do you mean that?  They would refuse to use a 30&quot; even if they were given one?  I&#x27;ve only met a few people who are of that particular disposition, and I personally consider them odd.  It&#x27;s a weird self-flagellation or quasi-Luddism.<p>In my experience, most people don&#x27;t deal with 30&quot; monitors because they have been effectively fixed at over $1,100 for the past 8 years, only recently being disrupted by the Koreans and Chinese.  From <i>that</i> perspective, where a small 1080 monitor can be had for a couple hundred bucks, it required a special type of enthusiast to pay the steep premium for 30&quot; displays.  But it looks that we&#x27;re finally getting some changes in desktop displays, and I consider this positive progress toward what I would consider an ideal.  To reiterate what I&#x27;ve said elsewhere, I want desktop computing to use nearly-immersive display technology, and I think this is more realistic in the mid-term than VR goggles.<p>But to be absolutely clear, I consider 30&quot; too small for desktop computing today.",1386013684

I don&#x27;t think so.<p>I think it&#x27;s much more likely that there is a normal distribution of breakdowns in fitness - a few very severe problems which manage to survive to birth, then many, many more variants with negative fitness, or ones which are good but very picky, and which may be left over from environments where they were +fitness.

If it can help me find street crossings, tell me when a light changes, and pin point specific entrances in heavily built up areas like strip malls I would pay what they’re asking in a minute. What intrigues me about this is using bone conduction to provide the information. My blindness is caused by a significantly underdeveloped optic nerve so the current development in the area of having cameras directly providing visual input to the brain will not work for me. Even if this device is vaporware hopefully the use of bone conduction technology may lead to something more useful in the future beside Bluetooth earphones I can pair with my iPhone.",1386012803

6835845,comment,6834093,6834093,12,0,dredmorbius,,,"A couple of observations:<p><i>You can only get better with experience.</i><p>But remember that <i>improving</i> requires <i>both</i> practice <i>and</i> feedback.  Practicing something that&#x27;s developing the wrong habits will just reinforce those bad habits through neural pathway strengthening.  This is a key principle in many skill activities (music, sports, gymnastics, strength training).  It&#x27;s one of the nuances to Gladwell&#x27;s &quot;10,000 hours&quot; premise.<p><i>Go Full Screen / Eliminate distractions</i><p>I&#x27;d have to heartily agree.  Full screen might not be entirely necessary (I often have reference or other materials present while composing), but removing distracting elements from my environment is hugely useful.  It&#x27;s also ironic to note Ben&#x27;s use of animated gifs to highlight his blog post (I ended up removing both with the Chrome element blocker plugin).  In general I either modify the CSS for sites I visit frequently, or use tools such as Readability (or Pocket or Instapaper) to provide simplified, streamlined, uniform, text-dominant presentations of online material (curating and tagging the content is an added bonus).<p><i>good writing is mostly good editing</i><p>Absolutely.  I&#x27;ve long considered it a bit like sculpting in clay.  First you gob a bunch of stuff up there, then you start carving away at what shouldn&#x27;t be there, occasionally moving bits around.",1386012259
6835844,comment,6835066,6835681,5,0,FreezerburnV,,,"That&#x27;s a pretty valid <but>...</but> tag. However, I would argue (based on what I know of software development and the stories that I&#x27;ve seen posted on occasion on HN) that knowing some of these oddities and details can come in a lot of handy someday. Even careful developers can accidentally run into some strange scenario which turns into one of these rarely-seen specifications, causing some bug. If you don&#x27;t know these kinds of things, you&#x27;ll have no clue where the bug could be coming from. And this is especially true in a language that can be as thorny as C++.<p>As an example, in a program I&#x27;m working on which is still some ridiculously simple 100-line program, I shadowed a variable name inside a loop. (C++) I figured it would be ok because I was declaring the new variable after I was done using the previous one. But apparently, declaring a variable at all in a scope causes the new variable to be the one used inside that scope, even from the beginning. And considering the two variables were of a different type, it was causing a problem. Not hard to find in a small program, but might be harder to find in a large one.<p>On the flipside, a lot of these issues might be relatively easy to find with a little intelligent Googling or asking Stack Overflow. But that time might have been better spent continuing development on the current project. And that time can add up.",1386012252

The only way to ensure efficient, high-load drone flight is to develop a hybrid design which uses wings to generate lift during cruise. The efficiency lost to the rotors is massive.<p>So I think eventually we will see tilt-rotor designs, where wings take over once the drone is airborne but the rotor disk is pitched horizontal for takeoff and landing. This massively increases energy efficiency, and makes it possible to go a lot faster.<p>The reason this hasn&#x27;t been done with larger airplanes (the only prominent example, V-22 Osprey, demonstrates the difficulty), is that combustion engines makes the design prohibitively complex.

Since drones showed up roughly 2003, it stands to reason that 2013 is when we should first starting seeing the tech become civilian viable.  In fact that seems to be true, there&#x27;s a whole lot of DIY material out there, and that&#x27;s from people who don&#x27;t have real world experience.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if as military contracts wind down the large amount of people who just developed a new set of expertise may try to break out into the private sector.  The only thing stopping the tech seems to be the FAA.  Obviously its not something to take lightly, there are real safety concerns here... but its not completely science fiction.<p>Why do we accept that modern warfare can be fought almost entirely with drones (libya?) but when it comes to civilian applications it&#x27;s a fairy tail publicity stunt?<p>I think bezos wants to turn a profit, and lowering delivery costs, and giving faster service might only make his company that much more valuable.

Both the major parties are full of authoritarians.<p>What I think it <i>might</i> provide is what we don&#x27;t have in the current situation - a basis for future change.  A party that actually stands up for what&#x27;s right provides a cause for effective protest to coalesce around - as things stand, who does a concerned citizen vote and work for, when no party supports change of substance?  You&#x27;re hardly going to spur on a popular movement with promises of working within the existing government to change the situation from horrifying to very slightly less horrifying.<p>I do believe there&#x27;s enough concern over these issues for a talented politician to work with and build on.

I do not know if Japanese actually understood that attacking Russia from their front was futile at that time due to several reasons.<p>1. Russia is big, very big. Traversing Siberia would have taken a long time. Something that they would have to do without any naval support. Can you imagine trying to establish supply lines through Siberia?<p>2. Add continental winter on top of that and you get no go on Japanese invading USSR. (Temperatures of 15-20 degrees centigrade colder than people living near the ocean are used to).<p>3. Because China would obviously sit very still, when large portion of Japanese ground forces would be absent.<p>4. Remember no naval support? Attacking Russia would effectively split Japanese fleet and ground army.<p>I do not know if Japanese understood those simple facts, but Russians sure did. European front was way higher priority than Siberia. An if Japanese did attack, an order of magnitude smaller, more mobile force would had been enough to harass supply lines and stall any progress. It is not only winter time that would have been problematic, when snow melts things are worse for a while due to all the mud.<p>Similar story with Germans, it is not that Russians in monumental effort stopped the advance. They merely stalled  German blitzkrieg (while taking heavy losses), and continental winter stopped it. I am not trying to take away from monumental effort thrown by soviets to stop the advance, but ultimately all it came down to: Germans could not advance and adequately deliver supplies and Russians could due to intact railroads.<p>* I am not saying those were only reasons, but people tend to underestimate importance of supply lines and role of winter.",1386011190

6588739,comment,6586812,6587440,2,0,hsod,,,"This brings up an interesting point.<p>When referring to &quot;content,&quot; (TV, movies, music) it is common for people on HN and Reddit to refer to digital information as something that should be freely exchanged, that ownership is a meaningless concept in a world where creating a copy of something is essentially free.  It is common for those who seek to lock down or restrict access to digital information in the form of entertainment media to be referred to as &quot;dinosaurs&quot; who are desperately clinging to an outdated business model and refusing to move into the modern age of free and ubiquitous data sharing.<p>Then, of course, there is the idea that online privacy is a fundamental right, and that guarding our personal information from both nation-states and corporate interests is of the utmost importance.  In this context, those who seek free access to digital information are cast as villains and reviled for using modern technology in a way that doesn&#x27;t fit with our classical understanding of privacy rights.<p>I understand that there are multiple people on HN and Reddit and they don&#x27;t think as one, but I think it&#x27;s fair to say that both of these opinions fall on the same side of the political spectrum.<p>I wonder if there&#x27;s a contradiction here?

If you&#x27;re a desirable woman and you go on most normal dating sites to meet men, you&#x27;ll get deluged with more emails than you can realistically even respond to. If you&#x27;re an everyday man who would like to meet new women, it&#x27;s a bit harder to find somebody because every desirable woman on these sites gets a ton of messages. The short of it is that the experience for everybody could be improved.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that this specific idea is the ultimate answer but I think there should be more experimenting with different types of sites in the dating industry than the traditional &quot;create a profile and send a messages site&quot; to figure out better ways of connecting people. OKCupid for example is experimenting more and more with things like events and group &quot;gatherings&quot; to meet people. Maybe that&#x27;s a better type of site. Hopefully people will continue to come up with and test new kinds of dating ideas.<p>PS: I think a lot of the outlandish statements by the founder are purely to generate faux media outrage and publicity.

Hacker News is near and dear to me; most of our early customers came through HN! I&#x27;m well aware of automated voting ring detection and flame-war detection, but I&#x27;m still left perplexed about our recent posts, which involved neither.

However, both received the slap once they hit the HN front page. The second post was popular enough it made it BACK to the front page, only to be slapped down AGAIN! In the case of the first CTOs post, I sent an email letting the CTOs and their companies know it was live and on HN. I suspected this may have triggered voting ring detection due to getting too many votes at the same time. I&#x27;ve been very careful NOT to repeat my mistakes on that one, but the second post still got the slap when it came out a few weeks ago!<p>Another post to get the slap was a detailed technical post by our CTO called &quot;Our First Outage&quot;. Front page one minute, gone down into the depths the next.<p>Today&#x27;s post, &quot;How Keen IO Uses Storm&quot; was also well-received, but it got the slap from #30 to #75 just about as soon as it hit the front page this morning.<p>We&#x27;ve posted these pieces from different HN accounts but the end result always seem to be the same -- if it&#x27;s related to Keen IO it gets the slap!<p>Once exception was my post on Friday about blogging, &quot;How to Write Good Blog Posts&quot;, which, ironically, is probably the least technically relevant to the community of them all. It got to stay front page for a couple of hours and didn&#x27;t get the slap! That disproved my hypothesis that my account or our domain was in some way marked for destruction, but also added validity to my hypothesis there may be a mod who doesn&#x27;t like us who happened to be out on Friday.

If it&#x27;s so easy to support your argument with evidence, why are you arguing with philosophical generalities instead?<p>I understand how the free market is supposed to work and why it usually does work. I&#x27;m still a huge fan, contrary to what you read between the lines (I agree with you on deregulating education, for instance). More on that later. But something is amiss in the US health care market. The socialists are beating us. By a lot. Not overall -- I do not believe their higher taxes provide a better net return for someone like me, not by a long shot, and so I do not plan to move -- but it is possible to section out health care for purposes of comparison, and our system has a 2-3x worse value proposition along that dimension. We agree about the general principle that markets tend to have better self-corrective properties than rulebooks. Where we disagree is that I think healthcare is an exception. A glaring exception that we have invested trillions of dollars into trying to fit with our free-market-is-better worldview and still find that it&#x27;s an exception.<p>What we already pay for medicare and medicaid would provide universal coverage if our system were as efficient as Canada&#x27;s or the UK&#x27;s (in terms of percent PPP adjusted GDP/capita spent on health care), so this isn&#x27;t even a philosophical question about how much we want to spend on government-mandated charity. It&#x27;s a question of getting value for the money we are already spending. You could postulate that the medicare/medicaid administration is spending money inefficiently, but two facts suggest otherwise. First, the overhead of medicare/medicaid administration is ~4% (vs 12-30% for private insurance), so the money isn&#x27;t disappearing into the bureaucracy itself. Second, medicare/medicaid drive a harder bargain than almost any other insurance plan (ask your doctor next time you visit, the administrators do not like dealing with medicare/medicaid), so it&#x27;s difficult to argue that medicare/medicaid are responsible for our inefficient health industry<p>We have two options:<p>1) Keep spending 20% of our GDP on health care (vs our neighbors at 10%) while we try different permutations of rules and hope to land on one that fixes the free-market feedback mechanisms and kicks it into gear.<p>2) Cut our losses and copy/paste the well-tested solution, using other countries as a template until we have health care at 10%GDP rather than 20%GDP.<p>Option #1 has been in the whack-a-mole stage for decades (the feedback mechanisms are broken by default, more on that later) and shows no concrete or theoretical signs of letting up. I&#x27;m for option #2. The experiment has been run, the results are in. Healing the feedback mechanisms in the health care market was a harder problem than it appeared. Saying that the next set of regulations or deregulations will make our health care market do a U-turn seems crazy to me, like saying that communism is the way of the future in 1990 while the USSR is busy collapsing. This time it&#x27;s our turn to cut our losses, thankfully in a less traumatic manner.<p>> I can&#x27;t even attempt to understand where you might be coming from.<p>MSCS student, ex-libertarian. I took a health care policy class in undergrad to satisfy a requirement and it changed my worldview. I had heard that the US health care market was inefficient, so I thought it would be a good place to look for opportunity. I thought that maybe I could use my data-fu to help make it better and possibly turn a profit while I was at it. The health care policy class seemed like a good place to get a 1000-ft overview of the industry.<p>As I learned more about the specifics of the health care market, I realized that the problems weren&#x27;t due to a strange historical trajectory, barriers to entry, obsolete/misguided regulation, failure to adapt, monopoly/lock-in, or any of the challenges I was familiar with from the software world. Not fundamentally, at least. The usual problems have analogs in other countries, yet they&#x27;re doing just fine compared to us. The &quot;traditional problems&quot; explain waste on the order of billions while the efficiency gap that needs to be explained is on the order of trillions (per year). I have already listed the explanations that I think best account for the gap, but to make a long story short: the health care market is the perfect storm of factors that frustrate the free-market optimization process.<p>> When it comes to healthcare the free market approach would create efficient markets quickly due to competition.<p>So why has this failed to happen? Our current system does not suffer from monopoly or regulatory capture. You are free to shop around between insurance plans, yet they operate at 3x the overhead of medicare/medicaid and 2x the entire (not just insurance) administrative overhead of the UK&#x27;s NHS. What do you plan to change and why do you think it will succeed where past efforts have failed? I have an explanation for the failure, and it is not one that deregulation will fix:<p>Customer feedback through buy/no buy decisions is broken in the health insurance industry. In other industries that also aren&#x27;t plagued by monopoly, dissatisfied customers push back by not buying a product. In the health care industry, a strange situation arises where customers don&#x27;t know that they&#x27;ve been duped. The bulk of costs are concentrated in a handful of customers (those that get cancer, get in a terrible car crash, etc) so if an insurance policy figures out a way to dump the expensive patients, 99% of customers never realize that the piece of mind they have bought is worthless and they never demand better. This isn&#x27;t hypothetical, this is precisely what happens: by design, private insurance doesn&#x27;t actually shield one from the cost of a debilitating injury or illness, leading to the statistic that 62% of personal bankruptcies in the US were caused by medical problems even though 78% of those people had insurance [1]. The insurance companies make sure each person has just enough &quot;responsibility&quot; so that they can dump their own responsibility if it ever actually comes due.<p>Innovation in the insurance industry happens largely by finding new, clever ways of fooling people into thinking they are covered for something that they are not.<p>> How do we deal with that situation? I&#x27;d say much like we do with auto insurance. You own it. It&#x27;s yours. It does not live and die with your employer.<p>Paying for insurance through your employer is a legitimate market innovation that decreases statistical, legal, and bandwagon-effect risk. Your employer provides two services to you: they aggregate your bargaining power with the rest of their employees, driving a better deal, and they decorrelate you with the specifics of the plan because you will take what they give you (bypassing the bandwagon effect).<p>This isn&#x27;t speculative, the market has already spoken, and declared that individual insurance is more expensive (if you think otherwise, go form an individual insurance company and sell it for less). As a libertarian, you, of all people, should respect this. The PPACA&#x27;s exchanges attempt to mimic the beneficial effects of an employer without going through an actual employer. I suspect it will work at least a little bit, after adjusting for the fact that we have sealed some of the loopholes individual plans used to dump sick people, which will necessarily increase costs. But I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll see administrative overhead fall even to 2x what we see in a typical social system, because most of the market problems are still there, and a single-payer system is still the limiting case of addressing the problems in [2] individually.<p>> What to do about the really poor who can&#x27;t afford any of it. We help them, of course. The details are not important here. We help them. Period.

Their treatment of women, in particular, would strike an American as archaic and quaintly Mad Men at best, and at worst barbaric and abusive.<p>I am reminded of a recent discussion on 4chan of, amusingly enough, this very essay, where a 4channer reading the appendix noticed that I wrote &quot;mediums&quot; instead of &quot;media&quot;, and outraged, wondered how anyone could take seriously anything I had ever written since I could not even use the word correctly.<p>At the risk of outraging you still further, can&#x27;t it be true that &quot;the future is already here, it&#x27;s just unevenly distributed&quot;? Can&#x27;t it be possible that in some respects Japanese society is further ahead on a trend than the USA, and in other respect behind?<p>> Younger Japanese (age 40 and below) tend to be more worldly and cognizant of other cultures, and understand that the social structures which served their parents and grandparents are keeping Japan held back and isolated, economically and socially.<p>I wonder... Not very long ago, I finished reading my first &#x27;visual novel&#x27;, one called _Umineko_. The patriarch of the protagonist&#x27;s family is what one might almost call a Western otaku - English-speaking, European-literature-loving, contemptuous of all things Japanese, and a few spoiler things as well - and the novels themselves are heavily influenced by Western murder mysteries & a bit of philosophy too. I was struck by how old-fashioned this preference seemed in the character. Similarly, I have spent a lot of time on Gainax & Hideaki Anno, and one thing that comes across is how much old Western SF and television Anno & other Gainaxers must have consumed, given the pervasiveness of the references in their work. But younger directors and anime industry figures seem to reference Western materials much less - I would be very surprised to see a _Babylon V_ or _Firefly_ reference in any anime I watched, whereas Anno would freely throw in allusions to Anderson&#x27;s _Thunderbirds_ TV series and now-obscure Western works like that. I&#x27;ve also seen claims by occasional Japan-related writers that actual English proficiency has declined, which certainly might reduce Western exposure, given how much of it would be in English. All of which makes me wonder what objective metrics there could be for &#x27;more worldly and cognizant of other cultures&#x27; and what they would show over the past 3 or 4 decades in Japan?",1382393868

(This is called &quot;fractional-reserve banking&quot; in order to confuse the uninitiated into thinking it is something abstruse, when it&#x27;s actually very simple: I&#x27;ve just defined it in one sentence.) The cash that gets paid to the seller when you close on the loan is created on the spot (ultimately it comes from the Federal Reserve, at least in the US, which can print money on demand--actually it doesn&#x27;t even have to &quot;print&quot; it since it&#x27;s just electronic entries in accounting databases); it doesn&#x27;t come from the bank&#x27;s vaults.<p>So the bank doesn&#x27;t really care whether or not you can pay back the loan; it makes its money on the &quot;processing fees&quot; at closing. The loan payments you make are going to third parties (in many cases, the bank sells your loan to a third party almost as soon as it&#x27;s created), who are spreading the risk of default much more widely. (If you ask, &quot;what happens when that risk isn&#x27;t spread widely enough?&quot;, the answer is that you get an economic meltdown such as the one that happened in 2008.) But since the primary lender is making money on fees, it considers people &quot;credit worthy&quot; who generate fees: i.e., who take on debt.

It may not change his ways, but it&#x27;ll make him respect how you feel about it, hopefully.<p>For me, it was 2009, the year everyone died. I lost so many friends and family, and so many of my friends lost friends and family, I couldn&#x27;t even count them all. My bandmate in particular struggled with a father who had been a lifelong hermit, and was utterly uncooperative in his own care. He had no will, and my bandmate was the sole heir of a house that had been in the family for generations (since the 1850s). It was a legal mess waiting to happen. Meanwhile, I lost another bandmate, just a few years older than me, to cancer, and lost a friend of 15 years to suicide. Terrible, terrible year.<p>This led me to a conversation with my children, who were 15 at the time. I told them that if I ever get to where I can&#x27;t take care of myself and their mother can&#x27;t take care of me for whatever reason, that they should do <i>whatever it takes</i> to take care of me. Take away my car, take over my finances, put me in a nursing home, whatever. I warned them that I&#x27;ll tell them not to do those things then. They shouldn&#x27;t listen to me then, because I&#x27;ll be senile!<p>But seriously, parents may not do what is best for their children, but they can at least care that that&#x27;s their choice.",1382393109

In many European countries, the counts for both bank holidays and vacation days are usually somewhat higher. Also, if you&#x27;re sick then for many salaried positions you would still get paid as normal, though would you probably have to get an official statement from your doctor for anything non-trivial and different rules might apply if you needed to take long-term sick leave.<p>A typical reckoning in Europe is that there are 365 days in the year, but only a little over 200 working days. Put another way, the fully loaded cost of a &quot;full-time&quot; employee here is probably 150-200% of their salary, and a significant chunk of the overhead is paying them for Monday-Friday days when they won&#x27;t actually be at work for one reason or another.",1382392897

Though from what I can discern, a lot of the problems have to do with poor technology usage.<p>People make a big deal about how using Word will lock you into a certain format when they're storing their data on floppies or, even worse, rasterizing it and keeping just the PS. Seems like the latter is a lot worse than the former.",1321768769
3257417,comment,3256982,3257362,3,0,DenisM,,,"I would like to add that PC manufacturers are not able to innovate precisely because Microsoft and Intel took all the money in the platform, commoditizing their complements. That's why PCs often suck in quality - they have to compete of price and they have to cut every corner, which sometimes they get away with, and sometimes not. And that's why they install crapware on their PCs - every penny counts in race to the bottom.",1321768685
3257416,comment,3256721,3257159,8,0,gchpaco,,,"You think emacs is one of the worst things to happen to computer science?  Thus putting it in the same rhetorical category as patents, multithreading, mutable data, garbage collection, open source, closed source, closed journals, governments, debugging and Microsoft?  Any one of which has far better credentials for that role?  And you say this because the language it is largely written in is grotty?  My god, man, get some perspective.  The rest of your rant is nearly as content free--there have been more attempts at sound systems programming languages in the last five years than in the previous fifty.<p>Look, Emacs is among the last survivors of a very powerful paradigm, along with Squeak, some Forths, AutoCAD to some degree, and a handful of others.  It is one of the last metarecursive programming environments.  It is not even the zenith of that paradigm--I would probably give the nod to the Symbolics machines with Zwei, but I am largely ignorant of Interlisp and know it is much beloved.  These environments are self documenting (for a very specific sense of ""document""), extensible, discoverable (for example, C-h k on a key sequence and then click through to the source code; or on the Symbolics you could I think Super-left click a user interface element and immediately start discovering its code, instrument it for debugging, what have you), have internals written in the same language (mostly) as the user script, and <i>any part can be modified at run time, with the modifications taking effect immediately</i> which is what distinguishes them from the Eclipses of the world.  These environments are, almost to a man, time consuming to learn; amorphous; frequently kinda pokey; and phenomenally, improbably productive.  The fact that some of them can edit text is almost an accident.<p>I've used a cross section of editors and IDEs and build environments and what have you from recent innovations to decrepit monsters like TECO, and almost none of them have learned anything from Emacs.  Some of them have better excuses than others (ed, for example, predating visual terminals).  Of the alternatives the ones I found most interesting and most productive are Acme (which is brilliant, but ultimately I think too good at editing itself and not good enough at editing anything else) and Sublime Text 2 (the first new editor I can remember in years with an apropos function), and I'm including the latter mostly on promise rather than actual competence at this time.",1321768670

I'd believe there are a lot more than 3000. We're talking about aptitude here, remember, so you have to consider people who could potentially get in, but don't apply. Do you really believe that the vast majority of the people who could even conceivably get in to YC, given some set of life choices, do in fact apply?<p><i>The only point I'm making is that small differences in underlying probability distributions can have large effects in the composition of people accepted into a highly selective program.</i><p>Yeah, if we're willing to grant you all kinds of crazy concessions, you can cobble together an explanation.  But you're asking for a lot to make YC selective and sensitive enough for your example to be reasonable. The YC selection process has to be consistent and incredibly accurate. Most of the people who are even capable of getting in must apply. Acumen in various areas has to be minimally or negatively correlated, and to even be <i>considered</i> for YC, one person has to have <i>all</i> of the relevant skills.<p>And this is just to get <i>close</i> to the gender disparity that YC sees.<p>Sure, I agree that normal distributions with minor differences in variance are very different at the tails. But to get this to explain away the gender disparity in YC selectees? Epicycles on top of epicycles.<p>(Also: if this is really about the tails of the aptitude distribution, going by the paper you cited and your same arguments, we'd expect to see a lot more Asian women than Asian men in YC. I suspect this is not the case.)<p>If anything, I suspect your risk aversion point is closer to the mark, but that opens up an entirely new cultural and political can of worms.",1321768172

This rant is mostly incoherent, and probably a troll, but I'll bite.<p>> I think emacs is probably one of the biggest mistakes to ever happen to computer science.<p>Emacs has nothing more to do with computer science than hammers and nails do with architecture. It's just a tool used to write code; computer science is about thinking algorithmically and mathematically about computation and problem solving.<p>> First, let's remember that emacs is not powerful in and of itself. It requires mastery to understand the potential and power that lies in it. The inclusion of emacs lisp is amazing, but seriously? Have you programmed a separate application in emacs lisp? You haven't? What? You used Scheme or Common Lisp instead? Than why the fuck are you defending emacs lisp?<p>Does anyone really push Emacs Lisp as a general purpose language? Really? I realize that Emacs is quite a bit more than just a text editor, but I've never heard it seriously recommended as an alternative to other languages for application development. No one is writing the next big revolution in software using Emacs Lisp, nor is anyone saying that we should.<p>The language is specialized for customizing and extending Emacs, and nothing more. Vim has its own extension language too, which is even more domain-specific. Are you seriously arguing that the use of specialized languages for the tasks that they're designed to accomplish is indefensible, simply because general-purpose languages also exist?<p>> And that's the whole fucking point of computer science. It's not writing the ""greatest"" programs. It's sharing. Sharing techniques, skills, libraries and ideas. And emacs is an artificial barrier. And worse than that, the most elite people in CS continue to protect it and cannot comprehend that their elitism is to the detriment to CS as a whole. It's complicated, arbitrary and designed in a terrible manner. I don't care if it makes sense to you. What matters is that you should be able to easily defend any design decision. And you can't.<p>How in the world is Emacs, or any programming tool, a ""barrier"" to computer science? No one is forcing you to use Emacs. If you don't like it, don't use it. There is nothing about Emacs that prevents ""sharing techniques, skills, libraries, and ideas"". Whether or not it's ""complicated, arbitrary, and designed in a terrible manner"" is a matter of opinion. Plenty of people feel that way; plenty of others don't.<p>Souped-up text editors like Emacs and Vim are certainly designed for expert users and do little to assist newcomers. So should those of us that are experts just throw out our advanced tools and switch to MS Notepad? The learning curve exists, no doubt, but there is a payoff to surmounting it. Why else would these tools have so many adherents?<p>> We need more people to start programming. We need better editors. Why is it that CS has some of the oldest, most decrepit tools with the most adamant defenders? Why?<p>Emacs is old, sure. That says nothing about whether it's worthwhile. Sometimes the earliest ideas in a particular field are the most revolutionary. And if you have better ones, then what's stopping you from making them a reality?<p>There is no shortage of editors out there that are more approachable to newbie programmers than this ""advanced"" kind. I'm a huge Vim user, and I think it's a fantastic piece of software that I could hardly do without, but I would not recommend anything of the sort to a newcomer. There are plenty of tools for that demographic, but when it comes to text editors for ""veteran"" programmers, there are really only the two big ones, plus a handful of others that lie somewhere in between in terms of complexity and power. I find it very hard to believe that new programmers are being turned off to the field by Emacs, of all things. There are countless aspects of the process of learning to program computers that are far more difficult than choosing a text editor appropriate for your needs.<p>> Seriously, we deal with fucking computers all day. The most arbitrary representation of knowledge possible. And all people do is whine about how things are ""good enough"" or ""no, someone made this decision a long time ago, and now a lot of people make the same choice, so don't be stupid and choose that.""<p>Again, you seem awfully bent on disparaging the status quo without offering any real alternatives.<p>> The number of new computer languages being invented is almost fucking SLOWING down. WTF? Computer science is about the drive to find better ways to express and share knowledge, and that means trying new things. Usually, they will suck. But jesus, we have to keep trying. And whatever we do, we have to help a). more people try programming, and stick to it b). support people following their own loony ideas.<p>The quantity of new languages being invented is hardly a great metric by which to measure innovation. Maybe most of the great ideas in programming language design have already been had, and now it's a matter of incremental refinement, ad infinitum. I'm not saying that's necessarily the case, but it could be. And what any of that has to do with text editors is utterly beyond my comprehension.<p>> I mean seriously, it's fucking sad how slow shit happens. Common lisp, one of the more powerful languages ever invented, got a wonderful tool called quicklisp last year. 15 FUCKING YEARS AFTER CPAN CAME OUT. Why the fuck is shit so fucked up, I mean jesus, it's fucking inexcusable. Our descendants are going to mock us to our faces til we fucking hara-kiri.<p>Another complete non sequitur.

There is always notepad or wordpad. There is also a word processor called Microsoft Word. Which generally does more than sufficient job. There are sufficient enough alternatives. Emacs can't become notepad just to become usable to general users. Emacs's design case is for programmers who need to do a lot text lifting, execute repeated patterns of complex text editing.<p>Keeping all this in mind Emacs is designed, to facilitate use of macros and alikes. There are also key bindings to enable short cuts to do that sort of automation quickly. Also there is a huge repository of what the community considers 'common pattern of solutions' to most problems developers face while editing code. Emacs is mean't to provide large gains in productivity while coding for long hours. Notepad is designed for a few minutes of use by a user. Vim is optimized on similar line of Emacs, but in a different usability case, which is also awesome and serves some users pretty well.<p>Also we already have drag and drop programming to a very large extent these days. Most people working on SAP, and package based solution don't see code in years. But they actually do a lot of programming. In most mega corporations there are business units, where there are consultants, who do a lot of domain logic coding by mere button clicks on GUI. You will surprised how many large number of people are actually with that sort of a thing these days.<p>Not to mention armies of Java programmers. If auto complete weren't to be there how many Python and Java programmers and their supply in the industry will actually scale? Given the verbosity and configuration hell I doubt even half of that would be possible. Even the mere existence of those programmers is dependent on the existence of eclipse. Remove away eclipse today, and you will see the supply of Java programmers will fall by 90%.

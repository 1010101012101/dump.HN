I'm sure the thousands of pedestrians actually injured and killed by cars every year never thought to ""look both ways"".",1259398509

964947,comment,964665,964678,0,0,etal,,,"Notes:<p>1. The fudge factor is flat after 1970. The hockey stick <i>we</i> care about is after 1980 or so, sharply increasing in the 1990s and 2000s.<p>2. The fudge corresponds to problems with recent tree-ring data that were discussed in previously published literature (I don't have the citation). The phrase ""very artificial"" almost certainly means it's a crude estimate based on some model that's simpler than the author would prefer -- hence, the flat line for recent values.<p>3. If this was an open-source project, you'd see a reference to the article that explains where the fudge came from, but it's not. Natural scientists tend to not really believe in software engineering, they just write a procedure and munge it until it works, leaving dead code and mysterious comments in their wake.

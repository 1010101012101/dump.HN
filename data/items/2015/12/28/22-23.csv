Abrams and Kasdan borrowed too many motifs and plot lines from A New Hope. So I agree with the criticisms of the article. But personally disagree with the conclusion, for two reasons.<p>First, my expectations were already very low, to the point of being non-existent. Mostly due to the prequels which attempted to push the series into new territory, but failed miserably. The prequel SFX were engrossing. But when it came to the backbone of the story - the plot, the dialogue, the structure, character motivations - it was obviously amateur hour. All I was expecting was a exciting and comprehensible space opera action flick, and that&#x27;s what we got.<p>Second, Star Wars is no longer Star Wars. It was at one time revolutionary, iconic, a cultural touchstone, and a right of passage for millions. Now it&#x27;s just another franchise amongst many - competing with Marvel, DC, Star Trek, Harry Potter, and many other glossy high-budget thrill rides.",1451343569

What do you do when you fire someone who had legitimate access to this password? You have to change everything or risk a compromise of all the systems sharing this password. Hence, the need for tools like sudo that separate authentication (what password / auth key) and access control (what rights).<p>With encryption, it&#x27;s similarly possible to break one big risk domain into lots of smaller ones using things like separate trust anchors (for authentication) or encryption keys (for access control).

Your use of the verb to find is quite interesting. Depending on structure it means different things. According to this graph it is a verb phrase (VP) followed by a noun phrase (NP:DObj) and a gerund phrase behaving as an adjective phrase object compliment. The verb to find can function in couple different ways. It can take a noun phrase direct object (NP:DObj) only without an object compliment such as the noun cat, as in to find a cat, with a semantic meaning of discovering something that wasn&#x27;t there earlier, or it can function like the verb consider which equates a noun direct object (NP:DObj) with an object compliment (ObjComp) which requires, unlike the first use case discussed with only one grammatical structure following it, two grammatical structures following it. What semantic meaning can we get from parsing whether there is one grammatical structure following the verb to find or two grammatical structures. In the first case, a dog can find the cat, but in the second case, a dog can&#x27;t consider which is a higher order cognitive function that requires reasoning. If I was building AI, I can already using Stanford&#x27;s NPL service determine programmatically how many grammatical structures follow to find and I can also deduce that the noun before the verb to find in this case you, or me, is something capable of higher level logical reasoning, most likely a person, or, perhaps, a dolphin, a parrot, or IBM&#x27;s Watson in very rare specific cases.<p>Any sentence can be parsed into its constituent parts. &quot;You might find Stefanie Posavex&#x27;s work inspiring&quot; is a free standing grammatical sentence which is used as part of a larger sentence. It can be broken further conceptually into you might find something and Stefanie Posavex&#x27;s work is inspiring. What I want to do is help students learn to take these last two sentences and mix them together with you and find into a meaningful larger sentence using interactive graphical visualizations.<p>A verb functioning as consider requiring two grammatical structures following it is one of a small number of ways a verb can behave. There are only a small handful of verbs that function as consider such as to think, to find, and to nickname.<p>Graphical visualization helps understanding this so much. The visualization I linked to is only proof of concept. If I used more specific labels on the nodes of the graph you would understand the concepts more clearly than me trying to write them. I&#x27;m working day and night on this. I&#x27;m learning about closures, prototypes, and the difference between pseudo class inheritance and delegation in Javascript.

I&#x27;ve been using promises long before ES7, and it&#x27;s actually harder for me to read async/await functions and reason about them because they look so much like ordinary functions but aren&#x27;t. \nThere are useful features in ES6/ES7, to be sure: fat arrows, destructuring, imports/exports. Classes and  spreads are useful too if you do a lot of React and JSX. But async/await, decorators and generators are just  fancy and questionable ways to perform routine functional stuff one can easily do in shaggy pre-ES5 Javascript.\nI write a lot of ES6/ES7/JSX at work and CLJS at home and 100% prefer the latter. \nI want immutable values with destructuring, lazy sequences, suit of threading macros, decent cond|p/case, protocols and whole CLJS ecosystem.\nI&#x27;ve adapted to ES6/ES7/Redux/RxJS and often even could write code near-identical to CLJS/Reagent/Re-frame/Reagi stack.

BUT, under the hood it seems to have a VERY powerful framework in place. The best parts of which is probably the extensive documentation and built in debugger, which is seamlessly integrated into the theme. Honestly, I don’t think I have ever used a theme that made it so easy to track down bugs.<p>It has other good part too, such as a build system (Gulp) for things like LESS, SASS, and image optimization. Its more advanced features are all done OOP style, and it uses some great libraries too (such as jQuery, Font Awesome, Webicons, Highlight JS, etc.)<p>But just like everything else it’s not perfect. At the moment it doesn’t have a comments template so it uses the default style of comments. And some of it is a little too complicated as well.<p>However, the good news about that is he says, “the comments template is on the way, and that there are only 5 functions you have to learn in order to take full advantage of this theme, and all but one of those are based off existing WordPress functions. The rest is already preconfigured for you so you don’t actually have to read the docs on it.” So at least in terms of a learning curve, it’s not so bad.<p>All in all, I really like Semantic UI and I am excited to work with it as a WordPress theme.",1451340453

For some remotely (i.e. not having physical access to the machine except once every 3-4 years) and so far the most valuable things I found was stability (LTS releases), security updates, enough mind-share to find answers to problems online, enough mind-share to have makers of hardware possibly contemplate supporting drivers for the distro, having hardware that works out of the box, predictable and simple UI.<p>GUI aesthetics are nice and make a difference, but I found those other things to be more important. The predictable part broke when Ubuntu switched their UI to something else (Compiz/Unity?) I don&#x27;t remember, but everyone got used to that eventually.",1451340281

Which, in my view, indicates that our actions should be held to a higher standard than that of animals. In the same sense that a person with mental disabilities that commits a crime might be held to a different standard than the average person, animals should be given some slack for similar reasons.<p>Anyway, I essentially agree with you, and I advocate for the idea you mentioned, of increasing the inclusivity of our ethics.",1451340165

You can have weak/unprotected VPN keys as well.<p>I think the author&#x27;s argument about using VPNs is more a &quot;right tool for the job&quot; thing. SSH is fine for remote shell, but then you start to need other network service access. You can use SSH tunneling, yes, but a VPN is better suited.<p>So, in a nutshell, the point is &quot;only expose a <i>single</i> service.&quot; And since a VPN is more flexible than SSH, might as well go with that if you have the choice. You can of course make counter arguments along the lines of &quot;expose only the minimal amount of functionality&quot; or whether you think a VPN or SSH is more secure.",1435348784

They deal mainly with the fact that, strictly, such pronouncements are not within the authority of the Supreme Court. They are correct, in a sense. But by that logic, Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. V. U.S. (1964) should not be; by that logic, we should have waited for America to realize, of its own volition in 50 states, that allowing a business to deny a black man a hotel room is fundamentally wrong. But for the group wronged -- consider the same-sex couples facing the death of a spouse, the endless and expensive legal hurdles, or the millions of black Americans who couldn&#x27;t sit at a lunch counter -- waiting for all 50 states to come to the right conclusion is cruel. No, the court has a moral obligation, where it can, to stand up for the people for whom justice for all would come too late. It&#x27;s certainly not what the Founding Fathers had in mind. But the Founders were not infallible, were not seers of the future; it is just as incongruous to hold them responsible for their failures as it is to hold us responsible for our failures we have not yet realized.",1435348604

I suspect that if you&#x27;d put as much of yourself into, say, tennis or soccer, that you&#x27;d have felt similarly.<p>EDIT:<p>I&#x27;ve been pondering this a bit more, and I want to share my thoughts.<p>I was thinking about how some of my friends react to losses in mental sports/games versus physical sports/games and their particular histories, as well as my own.<p>Playing a bit to the idea of dualism of mind and body, some people focus more of their energy on the mind and some on the body. This affects their notion of self. For you, your focus was on chess and the mind, consequently a loss in that game or evidence of your mind not being as honed as your opponents strikes your ego more than a loss on the tennis court might. I have teammates on a rec soccer league who take it very seriously. They spent their youths practicing soccer or another sport at least as much as you spent on chess. A loss on the field, or a near loss, hits them hard because their sense of self is so tied to their physical capabilities. Anything demonstrating that they aren&#x27;t as good as an opponent hits them harder than it would me. I&#x27;m a tad bit more like you (though never seriously competitive in mental games/sports), my particular focus in those years was on acquisition of knowledge and understanding. This is not a directly competitive thing (outside of trivia games like Jeopardy!), but meeting someone who understands a field, that I&#x27;ve studied, far better than I do is both inspiring and a blow to the ego. &quot;I&#x27;ve spent X hours, days, months studying this, and still I&#x27;m nowhere near this person&#x27;s level of understanding and capability.&quot;<p>All this is not meant to say that your view is wrong, but that what each person experiences as a hit to their ego is going to be different, and largely determined by what they put their energy into. Outrun a former sprinter and they&#x27;ll feel the effects of their age and it&#x27;ll weigh on their mind. Beat an old and unpracticed chess champion and it&#x27;ll be the same.

Long-term couples tend to take care of each other&#x27;s health and wellbeing. Marriage is a way of recognising that long-term care relationship.<p>In countries with any kind of government funded or subsidised health system (or even a private health system based on insurance), those benefits of being married are costs that would otherwise be borne by the rest of society.<p>When I&#x27;m old, having a partner to look after me means I&#x27;m less likely to need to go to hospital or need doctor&#x27;s visits. I&#x27;m less likely to be unhappy, so more likely to be economically productive. If I need to take time off work, or retrain, or whatever, two partners are able to rely on each other for both financial and moral support.<p>Social conservatives are right in the sense that marriage is for plenty of people a form of social &quot;glue&quot; that holds people together. The state has good reason to want people to be held together like that - because it makes citizens happier, more productive, less likely to need public handouts, more likely to be able to raise children successfully or produce taxable wealth - and so on and so on.<p>It&#x27;d be difficult to measure the economic benefit of marriage to the state, but the actual economic benefit of being married is pretty minimal (estate/inheritance taxes seem like the biggest benefit) compared to the benefit to society and to the state.<p>Most if not all of those things that marriage does are also applicable to same-sex couples, incidentally.",1435347181

So I might have a file in assets/javascripts/users/show.js because the users#show view is more complicated than I want to do in rails.<p>If that asset file exists, I have a helper automatically load it into the head section of the view layout when the users#show action is hit. The helper itself is only a few lines of some obscure rails code that looks up the name of the controller, action, etc and looks up the files in the assets directory. If you match the view directory structure to the assets directory structure, it stays very organized and is all done by convention.<p>In the show.js file, I will create an entire mini angular app (one file). The show.html.erb view will just contain angular markup (and maybe some erb). It&#x27;s that simple. If Angular needs some instance variables from rails, I just pass them in to js with a couple lines in a <script> tag at the beginning of the view.<p>If I need a custom directive, I put the templates for those in public/templates (there may be a better place for these, depending on what you&#x27;re doing - for my use case, this was fine).<p>There are some downsides - you have to separately compile each js file. I suppose you could do them all together, but I like keeping them separate. But largely, you can lay angular on top of rails in a very unintrusive manner this way. It probably doesn&#x27;t work for every situation - you have to keep your angular apps small or it gets complicated again. But it really lets you enhance the UI of a rails app without a lot of technical debt. Code reuse can be a challenge (organizing bits that are shared is kinda wonky), but often the angular apps are small and simple enough that this isn&#x27;t really a problem. Repeat yourself a little. It won&#x27;t kill you.<p>An example of where I&#x27;ve used it is to load a chart and some daily/weekly/monthly selectable data that is sortable by columns, by date, with pagination, search fields, etc. I make the data available via rails as JSON, and just have the angular app pull it all in for the user to manipulate.<p>Another would be a form that creates a query interface similar to the one used by google analytics to create custom segments.<p>There may be better ways to do all this, but this approach has served me well. It&#x27;s a little rough, and I&#x27;m sure it could be improved. As always, YMMV.",1435347167

It&#x27;s more accurate to say it&#x27;s a positive number, why are you correcting OP?<p>jr: But positive numbers are numbers!)<p>No, it is not an important point. It is a silly point that confuses the issue and is more wrong than right.<p>It is <i>NOT</i> accurate to say that it that the Constitution or Bill of Rights <i>protects</i> individual rights. They DO NOT <i>protect</i> individual rights. Instead, the Constitution provides for democratic self-governance bounded by some enumerated protections designed primarily to protect minorities. The hope was and is that these limited protections <i>in tandem with democratic self-governance</i>  provide a system of government that will protect individual rights.<p>The Constitution and Bill of Rights is substantively and substantially different from a document that might enumerate a list of protected individual rights. Ensuring individual rights is the purpose <i>and duty</i> of the entire democratic process, not just the Constitution.<p>To make the point clearer, there are many items in the UN Declaration of Human Rights that the US recognizes (culturally) as being valid individual rights. E.g. The US provides universal access to education and the culture, on balance, recognizes access to secondary education as a fundamental right. But there is no constitutional prerogative for meeting this or other &quot;rights&quot; -- that&#x27;s provided for legislatively. Georgia could defund its educational system tomorrow and the US Constitution wouldn&#x27;t have squat to say about it.<p>In conclusion, the Constitution (edit)WAS NOT PRIMARILY DESIGNED TO <i>PROTECT</i>(/edit) individual rights. It <i>protects</i> primarily minority rights and provides for a system of governance that we hope will protect all individual rights.<p>(*edit, alternative wording for the paragraph above because jrs235 is nit-picking.)",1435347032

If the answer is yes it&#x27;s large enough, then whatever strategy gets your software in the hands of the most number of users should be the path you follow.<p>Now, as a startup, I wouldn&#x27;t start by competing head to head with OpenTable&#x27;s salesforce going after their customers. That sounds expensive. Also, getting people to switch providers is always way more difficult. Plus, I think people value OT not because of their features but because of the network effect they bring. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you&#x27;ll definitely still be going one-by-one and converting users, but I don&#x27;t think you should start with those using your competition.<p>Instead start with new restaurants or those not using anything. To them, you&#x27;ll feel like a miracle.<p>The reason you want to maximize distribution of software and engagement (having something that even the free plan is worth talking to people about) is because going freemium is not unlike investing in startups or building up a portfolio.<p>You invest in your customers in mass (with free features not money) and you hope a small grouping of them will make back that investment many fold.<p>Like investing, freemium works best as a long term strategy. So when you look at your upgrade triggers, be sure not to cripple that free plan so much that you&#x27;re optimizing for conversion rate for users as SOON as possible. Convert them when they&#x27;ve grown to be successful. So they can say you were a key part of their success.<p>I think MailChimp thinks about this really well if you haven&#x27;t read their ideas already:

You get why startups exist in the computer sector and not in the traditional manufacturing sector?  It&#x27;s because growth is so much easier in the computer sector.  The marginal cost to add a customer in software is tiny.  The marginal cost to add a customer in a business with physical inventory is much higher.  Going from software to physical business is not to be desired.<p>Your point 2 is yet more awful for Uber:  Great, they get to compete on cleanest car?  So now in addition to having to buy these very expensive depreciating assets, they also have to add local employees everywhere to actually clean them?  Wasn&#x27;t the advantage here going to be that they took the cost of &quot;paying people&quot; out of the equation?  Uber&#x27;s growth is going to be based on their ability to build out a really competitive cleaning service?  Does that sound like a business you want to invest in?<p>Point 3 is interesting:<p>So, look, people who were already of the opinion that there&#x27;s too much car ownership have gotten excited about the potential of driverless cars to increase car utilization.  But &quot;increasing car utilization&quot; isn&#x27;t a goal of normal people.  &quot;Saving money and/or receiving more value&quot; is the goal.<p>A heavily utilized Uber car is cheaper on some margins than a lightly utilized personal car (that is, it&#x27;s cheaper based on time-based depreciation and on parking fees).  It&#x27;s more expensive on other margins (it drives more miles per passenger served than the personal car, so its fuel costs, maintenance costs, insurance costs, and milage-based depreciation are higher).  And of course Uber has to make a profit, so that&#x27;s an additional cost as well.<p>How does that all play out?  You can add up the hypothetical costs fifteen different ways based on different assumptions, and come up with whatever numbers suit you.  The truth is that nobody knows how the cost of ownership of driverless cars is going to break down yet.<p>But I will tell you one thing:  No car, Uber or otherwise, is going to be 95% utilized.",1435345414

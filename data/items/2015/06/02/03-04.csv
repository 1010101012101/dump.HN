I don&#x27;t know how old or social you are, but I&#x27;ve lived long enough, and being a lot more social than most, gotten to meaningfully know enough types of people to see good eggs from bad, and to tease out their political leanings and relations to &quot;the other&quot; pretty clearly. You obviously never know if someone is in fact a secretly &#x27;abusive&#x27; person, but the # of people that are in fact secretly bad flying under the radar despite a full on appearance of sincere care for &quot;the other,&quot; is extremely small.<p>(Your claim about secret evil behavior is probably 1-3 out of 100 at most.)<p>We need to have the tougher discussions about what political, socio-economic actions can be taken to bolster minorities in tech, not what &quot;subjective changes&quot; we can try to force onto milquetoast white males, which is actually a much &quot;easier&quot; discussion & more &quot;appealing&quot; narrative for a host of reasons, hence people gravitating towards the easy way out.<p>If you feel strongly that I am wrong, I encourage you to submit citations and data to back up your argument, that there is a huge contingent of oppressive white programmer males, and that such males are the root of the minorities in tech problem.",1433217346

Yes, for a value of &quot;some.&quot;  (If you put a gun to my head, I&#x27;d say &quot;Maybe 5% of the engineering workforce at AppAmaGooBookSoft.  Possibly modestly higher than that in finance.&quot;)  The shortest path to it is &quot;significant contributions to a major revenue driver for a large company combined with aggressive negotiation.&quot;<p>Depending on where you draw the bar for &quot;wealthy&quot;, there are a lot of dev-related businesses which can get you there.  Consultancies with employees throw off a lot of money on a yearly basis and also build value which can be sold.  Profits for a well-managed e.g. Rails consultancy are on the order of $2.5k~$10k <i>per employee</i> per month (math here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7155387"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7155387</a>), so if you run a 10-person consultancy, you do pretty well for yourself via distributions while also drawing the market salary you&#x27;re paying all the employees.<p>There exist many product businesses which are primarily or largely software in character.  There exist hundreds of software companies which toil in relative obscurity whose founders are (generally very quietly) millionaires even when one doesn&#x27;t count the value of the company itself.  I built a consulting career off of working for SaaS companies with, in the main, $10 to $50 million a year in revenue.  There exist lots of them.  The rough economics are often 10% COGS 10% marketing 10% G&A 50% salaries 20% &quot;whatever the owner feels like.&quot;<p>Many of these paths will not involve you being primarily working on compilers and dev tools.  (Compilers are a tough sell -- dev tools perhaps less so.  There exist plenty of great small dev tools companies.)  Even if that is what your business actually makes money on, you will probably have to a) get into business and b) spend the majority of your cycles on building the business rather than building the thing the business makes, unless you take the well-compensated employee route.<p>There are your answers.  Here is my question: what do you want out of life?  What does &quot;wealthy&quot; mean to you?  What motivates your desire to retire early?<p>I once wanted to retire early, but that was a symptom of the underlying affliction &quot;I hated what I was doing for a living.&quot;  If you see wealth as an opportunity to choose to spend most of your cycles on something other than what you presently do for a living, you probably can achieve that without being sold-a-startup-now-I&#x27;m-loaded wealthy.  Some of the happiest people I know run quiet little cottage industry software businesses on the Internet in preference to the day job.  Most don&#x27;t have seven figures in the bank, but their day-to-day lifestyle might resemble that of a &quot;gentleman of means.&quot;<p>If you want to have sufficient free cycles to study something, consider as an option &quot;Create some enduring source of value which solves the sustenance-for-myself-and-family problem with the minimum number of hours required per week; spend my freed-up-time studying rather than filing TPS reports.&quot;",1433216794

9643713,comment,9640349,9640349,0,0,wmoser,,,"I&#x27;m not quite sure how I feel about this. Mechanical equipment lifespan normally follows a well curve. Premature failures from manufacturing defects and improper component installation or commissioning taper off to a period where there is relatively low failure rates with proper maintenance until a certain point where equipment fails from age (fatigue, worn parts etc). If the end user is the one to specify the component, this could be great, you&#x27;re not paying for unused time at the end of the components life. Some components are going to be replaced on a time schedule regardless of if there is usable life in it or not, some things are better to do on your schedule than a broken components.  There is a warranty on the component for the full life of the pump so if you&#x27;re doing the spacing you can be reasonably assured it will last its required life span or replaced.\nOn the other hand, if I purchase a piece of equipment from a different company and expect it to last N years, but they are using this component to save money and only opt for it to last M years, and don&#x27;t disclose the life span, I could end up paying for N-M years of expected service that I don&#x27;t get to use.\nAs an aside of other software limited hardware, Caterpillar  c-series Diesel engines are software limited to a certain extent.

9643692,comment,9626985,9642812,0,0,Natsu,,,"> The charge of entrapment is separate from the severity of the crime someone is entrapped into or whether the entrapment would be considered a sufficient motive, were it not simulated. It is merely enough that the police coerced the defendant.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s separate, but the point was that there are no excuse defenses that cover it,  period.<p>> The blackmail, however, was for a delayed use of force - loss of freedom/liberty - which is tantamount to loss of life, and indeed in this case Ross lost the remainder of his life.<p>The law recognizes no such equivalence, nor do any of your sources show that.  It would be ridiculous for the law to reward you for trying to escape being brought to court, particularly if you thought you had a reason you&#x27;d be sent to jail after their examination.<p>> It would be uncharitable (again) to suggest that it was merely about property. But (again) all one needs to establish entrapment is threat to property.<p>The threat of going to jail when your crimes are exposed is one made by the court in the first place, so how can it rule that it was somehow wrong to threaten you with punishment or excuse you for trying to have someone killed to avoid answering to the court?<p>I did support that by pointing out how none of the excuse defenses cover this in general.  Hiring a hitman is simply criminal, so you need some reason to say that a law-abiding citizen might think it was okay in this circumstance, which brings us to the excuse defenses.  Courts do not entertain hypotheticals, so there&#x27;s no precedent.  If you want to argue that they do, you should instead find a time when someone was excused for hiring a hitman.<p>> Please stop referring to webcomics as &quot;the&quot; law guide.<p>Okay, now this is just silly.  &#x27;The&#x27;, as I used it, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s the only guide or the definitive source of all law, it means it&#x27;s the same one I&#x27;ve been referencing.  You can denigrate it as a &#x27;comic&#x27;, but legal textbooks actually look very much like that comic in written form.  They lay out various scenarios and explain how the law plays out.  So the main difference is that this one has little illustrations.  It still covers the elements of each item and gives examples of how they work.<p>> All the the defense needs to do is show that there was pressure (coercion).<p>They have to show that they were not otherwise inclined to commit the crime and that the coercion was sufficient to change their mind (subjective standard) or to change the mind of any law abiding citizen (objective standard).  &quot;They&#x27;re allowed to go after those who would say yes.&quot;<p>You quote that &quot;the defendant has to offer evidence to clear their willing involvement in a crime&quot;<p>But such evidence has been offered.  They show him carefully considering whether to get a hitman and answering &quot;yes&quot; with no evidence of reluctance or refusal, save some worries about how it might impact his business.  The fact that he deliberated works against him, too.  He could more easily claim that the pressure got to him if he had acted hastily, in a panic.  The fact that it was a coldly calculated move will leave people to infer malice.<p>> DPR will be facing separate charges in a separate case for the hitman, will he not?<p>Maybe, but he&#x27;s got a bunch of life sentences right now, so I almost wonder if they will even bother?  I don&#x27;t expect them to play nice here, though.  Whatever they choose will be to make sure he&#x27;s well and thoroughly screwed, given how high profile this is.<p>As you can see, I have no illusions about them playing nice.<p>> It is not my responsibility to establish this.<p>I pointing out that the burden of proof is, legally, on the side of the one claiming entrapment.  That&#x27;s how the law works.  If you want to convince me that DPR was entrapped, that&#x27;s what you have to establish.  Any lesser burden does not meet the standard set forth in law and is, for that reason, unconvincing.<p>> If the police entered a mall, forced someone at gunpoint to kill another person, could that person then be arrested for murder with no possibility of arguing that they were entrapped?<p>This scenario is in the duress chapter, albeit not by a cop.<p>The person in that scenario was guilty if they pulled the trigger.  They might get it reduced to a lesser offense like manslaughter, but they wouldn&#x27;t be excused.  The person, cop or otherwise, holding a literal gun to their head would also be arrested.<p>No such scenario is on offer here, though.  The loss of freedom resulting from blackmail over exposing one&#x27;s crimes would be caused by the court itself.  And the court is going to trust the court&#x27;s own judgement (how could it not?) over the contents of the blackmail.  As it will believe that it would fairly judge a law-abiding citizen (for whom the blackmail would be false), it has every reason to infer by that very fact that those who would hire a killer to escape the court&#x27;s own scrutiny are up to no good.<p>Moreover, a court does not consider its own threat to jail you in the event it judges you to have broken the law to be equivalent to losing your life.  So you cannot draw a hasty equivalence between being jailed and being killed and try to use the duress rules for losing your life.  The duress rules don&#x27;t even excuse you for killing someone when there&#x27;s an immediate threat to your life, so why would they excuse something less than that?  Now, the self-defense rules can excuse you for protecting yourself, but they require an <i>immediate</i> threat (among other things), and yet DPR had time to write about this in his diary, as I have quoted up thread.<p>If I&#x27;m dismissive, it&#x27;s because I cannot find a case for him to make here, based on law.  But this is nothing.  Actual lawyers are positively savage in how they destroy weak arguments.<p>So I do not expect his lawyers to argue this in court, though this is the sort of argument I might expect if he went pro se and tried his own hand at arguing with the court.  He might do that just to grand-stand, but it wouldn&#x27;t buy him anything but press coverage.<p>I expect that he will appeal somehow, and his lawyers will likely cite some evidentiary grounds, or similar procedural matters (e.g. &quot;the trial court improperly allowed this evidence because...&quot;).<p>I expect him to lose the appeal.  If he tries to appeal to the Supreme Court, I expect that will end with them denying his petition for a writ of certiorari.<p>You, and anyone else still reading this, can determine the relative quality of our expectations by comparing what we have written is likely to happen to what actually happens.  There should be some mismatch for both of us, of course--nobody has a crystal ball--but the distance between our expectations and reality is likely the most objective way to make an assessment.<p>I think perhaps that would be better than continuing further.  Feel free to make your own predictions.",1433216150

To check whether a piece of Nim code is safe, you check for the presence or absence of these keywords; e.g., you can grep for &quot;ptr&quot; in Nim, while grepping for &quot;*&quot; in C# isn&#x27;t particularly helpful. Every unsafe feature in Nim has an associated keyword/pragma. Having a special &quot;unsafe&quot; keyword that says, essentially, &quot;this procedure can contain other unsafe keywords&quot; is sort of superfluous.<p>Note: these unsafe features have two purposes. One is to interface with C/C++ code. The other is to be able to write close-to-the-metal code in Nim rather than in C (where you wouldn&#x27;t gain any safety by using C, but lose the expressiveness of Nim). This is, for example, how Nim&#x27;s GC is itself written in Nim.<p>None of the unsafe features are necessary for high-level programming, i.e. unless you actually want to operate that close to the metal.",1433216125

It&#x27;s an international city where a large proportion of residents come from all over the world and dozens of languages are spoken. The air is clean, there are no traffic jams, the metro is extremely cheap and spotless. And there&#x27;s giant toucans living in the mango tree of my garden, right next to the centre of town - beat that SF.<p>Most importantly, government is not corrupt and has over the last 40 years gotten a pretty good track record of doing what is right. Both Lees have been exceptional leaders under any measure; amongst other things, the father influenced the direction of the world by directly influencing DXP towards the Chinese &quot;glasnost&quot; that is responsible for how the world looks today. I used to be pretty libertarian (think Swiss &quot;don&#x27;t have a Federal government&quot;), but realized living here that a clean, non-corrupt government can also work incredibly well.<p>Another thing that flies under the radar of most critics is that Singapore has successfully set up a system to allow migrant manual labour legally; it is one of the very few places in the world where your Bengali construction worker on $500/month can go to the police, complain he hasn&#x27;t been paid on time, and see his employer fined within two weeks.

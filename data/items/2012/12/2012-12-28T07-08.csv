Then I did some non-blocking socket/select programming and thought, ""I wish I had a library that.."" and then realised what twisted did.<p>There's a few reasons I'm not using it now. Main one is that I've turned against frameworks. I find it's generally easier to understand a problem and write the code than to really learn a generic framework and coax it to your needs. And by just writing the code yourself you don't have to deal with dependencies, you have more freedom to make changes, debugging is easier, it's easy to deploy in a restricted environment.<p>Also, I have a rule of thumb when I'm writing python that if I'm using inheritance I'm doing something wrong. I have huge trouble understanding duck-type code that uses inheritance. Encapsulation is always possible, and I find it a lot easier to refactor. Twisted uses inheritance extensively. The docs encourage you to extend their classes. In places the application developer is expected to reach into framework objects and poke variables.",1356680852

4976893,comment,4976559,4976559,72,0,saurik,,,"Why do people host static websites on S3 at all? It really isn't designed for that: it is an object store. Yes: it has a URL structure accessible in a way that makes it look like static hosting, and Amazon caved pretty early to people wanting to use it that way by adding features to make it more reasonable, but it doesn't fix the underlying problem.<p>Specifically, it is both allowed to--<i>and often does</i>--return 50x errors to requests. The documentation for the S3 API states you should immediately retry; that's fine for an API where I can code that logic into my client library, but is simply an unacceptable solution on the web. Maybe there are one or two exceptions to this, but I have simply never seen a web browser retry these requests: the result is you just get broken images, broken stylesheets, or even entire broken pages. Back when Twitter used to serve user avatar pictures directly from S3 the issue was downright endemic (as you'd often load a page with 30 small images to request from S3, so every few pages you'd come across a dud).<p>Sure, it only happens to some small percentage of requests, but for a popular website that can be a lot of people (and even for an unpopular one, every user counts), and it is orders of magnitude higher of a random error rate than I've experience with my own hosting on EC2; it is also irritating because it is random: when my own hosting fails, it fails in its entirely: I don't have some tiny fraction of requests for users all over the world failing.<p>Regardless, I actually have an administrative need to stop hosting a specific x.com to www.x.com redirect on some non-AWS hosting I have (the DNS is hosted by Route53, etc., but I was left with a dinky HTTP server in Kentucky somewhere handling the 301), and I figured ""well, if it doesn't have to actually request through to an underlying storage system, maybe I won't run into problems; I mean, how hard is it to take a URL and just immediately return a 301?"", but after just a few minutes of playing with it I managed to get a test request that was supposed to return a 301 returning a 500 error instead. :(<p><pre><code>    HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error

This wasn't just a single-time problem either: I've setup a loop requesting random files (based on the timestamp of the test run and a sequence number from the test) off this pure-redirect bucket that I've left running for a few minutes, and some of the S3 nodes I'm talking to (72.21.194.13 being a great example) are just downright unreliable, often returning 500 errors in small clumps (that one node is giving me a 2% failure rate!!). S3 is simply not an appropriate mechanism for site hosting, and it is a shame that Amazon is encouraging people to misuse it in this fashion.<p>(edit: Great, and now someone downvoted me: would you like more evidence that this is a problem?)",1356680189

4976864,comment,4976551,4976837,1,0,_delirium,,,"Ah yeah, that makes sense to me. Even if you treat 'd' as a kind of modifier in French (it turns the 'j' from a sibilant into an affricative) it's clearly still having an effect on the pronunciation. I was somewhat objecting to whether the the 'd' <i>itself</i> is being pronounced, but that does get pretty hair-splitting, especially since /d/ is a stop. The transcription /d/ sure makes it look like it's pronounced, but if IPA used a single character to transcribe the affricative, the 'd' would look like it disappeared in French too. But, granted, rather than having no effect (as in English), in French it'd still modulate the pronunciation of the 'j' even in that analysis.<p>Incidentally, I wonder if there are any languages where /d/ != /d/ or if it's just impossible to produce that sequence.",1356679238

Though KDE offers a lot of customization and has cool effects it just isn't polished enough. The integrated menu and title bar in Unity is enough to stop me from moving to anything else.

There is a recent distressing trend in UI design that providing the user with options always makes the UI harder to use.  This means taking control away from users and giving it to best case devs who may not have thought of everything worst case suits with corporate agendas etc.  Computers are supposed to make peoples lives easier not pidgeon-hole them into cookie-cutter lives.  Sure the ideal UI doesn't require instructions but UI design is hard and I'm tired of seeing shortcuts.  If you need instructions once in a while that's fine.  People take college courses in how to use excel. They can read a five paragraph description of your UI.  And if it tells them about features that they were hoping to see that you didn't omit to dumb down your UI for them then they might even like it better.",1356678252

She also got a feel for that based on people asking about going to the university in her department, she hears a <i>lot</i> of stories, arranges and gives lots of tours, etc.  Hmmm, now that I think about it I cannot remember a single student I knew who came from a broken home.<p>Basically, it appears that once parents divorce, at least one parent is not willing to pay what the College Board/the school expects, and that&#x27;s game over.",1375926842

My parent never supported me with a dime since they didn&#x27;t have much. I didn&#x27;t have any scholarships. I saved up some money from high school and used that for the first year of college, then started working as an co-op. How did I do it? I went to school in Germany. That&#x27;s also where I&#x27;m from. Back then there was no tuition and I only paid 120 Euros of administration fee per semester. I had it easy. I could study freely, I had everything I needed and the beer at the universities&#x27; vending machine was cheap. Life was good. Back then in 2004 I never read any English/US news or community web sites. I didn&#x27;t know what college was like over there.<p>After I graduate came to the US and I&#x27;ve been living in a typical college town at the east coast for ~7 years. I have many undergrad and graduate friends most of which are American. I&#x27;m _BAFFLED_ at the simple acceptance of this rip-off fucked up higher education system. It&#x27;s not even a topic ever that our local University President just raised tuition by another 5% this year. And a ~40% raise in the last couple year. In Germany, they started talking about introducing a 500 Euro tuition in 2006(?) and introduced it in 2007. Students where furious, they protested on the streets, they occupied the main buildings. They raised there voices. They started petitions. The press was on our side. They introduced them and students investigated on how the tuition was going to be used (contract only allowed to use it towards better education and not for maintenance/bills) and problems were discovered. Long story short: In 2013/2014 there is only one state left that still has a tuition of 500 Euros. The rest abandoned it all.<p>I have asked this question many times:<p>Why do Americans not protest?<p>Take the French: they kidnapped their CEO and threatened to kill them (~2009). They burned down parts of their factory. They raise their voice. Yet, with a ridiculous policy here in the US, I see nothing ever happen. I heard there was some protest about PRISM in S.F. last week. I frankly missed the coverage about that since it may have been to small. There were bigger protests about PRISM in Germany last week. This is sad and I don&#x27;t understand it.<p>Students of America: Stop wining on Internet forum, they do not tend to often get coverage of the media.<p><i>You want main stream TV coverage: Go on the streets and protest.</i>",1375925257

Your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) and need-based limit may have changed, but there other ways to pay for school. (All of the following assumes you haven&#x27;t already hit the overall government loan limit; if that&#x27;s the case, you&#x27;re at a university you honestly cannot afford.)<p>For example, the Stafford loan program offers unsubsidized loans (meaning interest accrues while you are in school) to all eligible students regardless of need. The eligibility requirements for these loans amount to being legally allowed to attend school in the US and not being in default on existing student loans.<p>As an independent student, you should be able to borrow up to $12,500 in unsubsidized loans directly from the government, regardless of your EFC. It will be more expensive than your other loans in the long term, so you should weigh the cost of two years of additional interest against not finishing school.<p>All of that said...<p>Something really feels wrong about your financial situation. The automatic-zero Expected Family Contribution limit for an independent student is $24,000. Assuming you were living on student aid from January to May and made $25.85/hour, 40 hours a week from June to December, for a full 30 weeks (unlikely given holidays, etc), you should have made right around $31,000 pre-tax.

Online via database hack (this is a serious PCI-DSS violation if the perpetrator has the encryption keys or the system storing the info isn&#x27;t protecting the data), could have been stored in her browser cache and someone sneaked a peak at starbucks when she went to the bathroom.  Or a physical card skim which typically happens from skimming devices appended to gas station and atm card readers, or a server at a restaurant quickly skims the card data while taking your card away to pay for the meal.<p>Either way they got the card #.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s feasible to completely prevent card info from being compromised, too many possibilities for human error on behalf of the cardholder or merchants/processors trying to protect the data, which face a seemingly never ending list of people willing to steal card info for a quick buck.<p>Part of what makes thefts like this hard to track down is the fact that there are numerous parties and systems involved in the transaction.  There&#x27;s starbucks website, and I&#x27;m sure they use and outsourced provider to manage their stored value accounts, who in turn uses an outsourced payment provided to process the credit/debit card payments, who plugs into MC or Visa rails to hit the cardholder&#x27;s bank.  In my mind all of these parties are at fault for not catching this, but I admit it&#x27;s easier said than done when processing billions of electronic transactions every day.<p>The easiest way to prevent identify this type of fraud would have landed on her bank&#x27;s shoulders.  First recognizing the initial test txn in Ohio was questionable, and then they should have had a velocity trigger on the same account # being used at the same merchant numerous times.  Starbucks  (and their partners) should have a similar velocity trigger looking for repeat purchases from the same card# within a certain time frame regardless of dollar amount.<p>In the end the crooks learn the fraud rules, adjust their practices, and the good guys have to play catchup while trying not to prevent good transactions from getting stopped.<p>Maybe the best way to protect yourself as a consumer is to routinely (daily, twice a week, etc) review the purchases made on your accounts.  It&#x27;s clear you can&#x27;t depend on the companies making money off your spending (i.e. electronic payment providers and your bank) as they get paid when you spend more, and they&#x27;ll only go so far to protect you before the ROI isn&#x27;t there.",1375924882

Like the other posts say here, NETWORK.<p>Go to local meetups and present yourself as a real professional. Create business cards (BONUS: Make yours stand out from the rest). You will receive many business cards by going to these meetups. You can probably gauge what would make yours flashier.<p>Update your LinkedIn, Twitter, HackerNews, Blog, etc immediately with solid and presentable information. If you&#x27;re unsure of how to do this professionally, check out other professionals&#x27; pages and emulate success.<p>Now, BUILD THAT PORTFOLIO. Even one side project is generally enough to show someone that you can do the work. Do you want to show off your skills, but you&#x27;re not sure what to build? Take a popular site and build a small client for it.<p>This is one of the most exciting experiences you will ever go through.

You defer your university fees throughout the duration of your studies, apparently no matter how long they last. The programme is not means tested at all, so it is available for every single domestic student studying uni here, no matter what.<p>That loan is then paid back only once you start earning more than a threshold amount of taxable income (this year, $51,309 - it&#x27;s not a low income by any stretch) and the payment amount is graduated depending on how much over you earn, from 4% of your income at that threshold amount to 9% once you hit $95,288 or above [1]. There is no real interest charged on the debt - the loan is only indexed to CPI every year, so that the real cost of the loan amount doesn&#x27;t change. The repayment is treated like tax - either taken out as you earn your wage or squared every year upon doing your tax return.<p>The perk that rich people get is that if they pay their bill upfront (that is, each semester as they study), they get a 10% discount on the total cost of the tuition for that semester (apparently, off memory it was 25% when I went through about 5-10 years ago). If you put it on HECS, you instead pay the full amount.<p>Oh, and also for every domestic student, a semester of full-time study costs on the order of $3000-$5000, so a 3 year degree is about $18k-$30k of the above debt [2], depending on what you study. It&#x27;s heavily subsidised by the government.<p>The system is funded, in part, by international students, who pay the full fee amounts (no government subsidy) if they choose to study here.<p>The major criticism of the system is that students can just incur this debt then flee the country. If they earn no taxable income here, they never have to pay it back no matter how much they earn overseas.

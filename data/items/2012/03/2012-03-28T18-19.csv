3767767,comment,3766284,3766284,3,0,jsz0,,,"About 90-95% of the bandwidth available 'on the wire' is already being used to deliver Comcast's video service. So if this is the first nail it's been there for an awful long time. The way traditional VOD is delivered (QAMS full of MPEG2 programs) is actually very inefficient. There may be 4-8 QAMS just sitting there inactive if your neighbors aren't watching VOD. The switch to IP delivery eventually will allow Comcast and other MSOs to use their bandwidth more efficiently.<p>From the customer's perspective nothing really changes. Technically your modem will probably be provisioned differently to support the extra services. So for example if you buy a 50Mbit/sec Internet package and a video package from Comcast your modem would actually be provisioned with multiple service flows -- a 50Mbit/sec for Internet traffic and another 50Mbit/sec reserved for Comcast services. That second 50Mbit/sec service flow allows you to have the same video service functionality as the 2-3Gbit/sec of broadcast video they presently waste 90-95% of their spectrum on. This will be reclaimed for the big general-purpose IP data pipe. Comcast will continue to use some percentage of that pipe for their own services but it will be a much smaller percentage than they use today.<p>So really everyone wins in the end. IP set tops are cheaper than traditional cable set tops. Consumers get to use Comcast services integrated into devices they already own. Comcast's competitors get a bigger dumb-pipe into people's homes to ride on. I admit it looks bad if you don't understand the technology but it's important to remember the bandwidth crunch that Comcast and other MSOs have is directly related to how they presently deliver their own services. Any effort they make to solve that problem is good for consumers in the end.",1332961182

Much of that cost is tied up in things like paying researchers and graduate students to do studies during the decades of time between missions, obscene university overheads, re-inventing the wheel with a new spacecraft design for every mission, prime contractors who attempt to <i>maximize</i> the number of subcontractors and resulting complexity because that awards them points in the selection committee, etc.<p>Private industry could do it way, way cheaper.

The impossibilities are the reason the movie did well; no half educated person is going to seriously attempt delivering a child with a vacuum over a webcam. At the same time, these stupid feats brought people to the movie, and forced them to realize how pathetically screwed up our education system is. Sure, we didn't do anything to fix it from that one movie--but for at least a few months, every time the movie was brought up, people started caring about changing the way our kids were taught.<p>I'm not suggesting this movie was something that raised awareness about an unknown issue, but it did succeed in bringing it to the forefront for quite a while, as Aamir's movies have been known to do. If you've seen other Bollywood movies, you know that 3 Idiots is a godsend when compared to the literally thousands of song filled intellectually vacuous love stories that we've been inundated with.<p>Furthermore, that suicide wasn't for the helicopter. It was after the dean called his (sick?) father, and told him that his son was not graduating that year. I do not remember the specific circumstances (I have terrible memory and watched this movie a few months ago), but claiming that the suicide was due to an engineering failure is ignoring many aspects of the student's life.<p>---<p>As for the string solution--I don't really see why you need precision in cutting a pizza in 11 slices for a random customer. It's an interesting solution, one I hadn't thought of, and I'd say one that many others hadn't thought of. The point was to deal with what a cook would have in his hands, not a mathematically sound approach. While the latter might be clean, it would be physically impossible to implement with a pizza cutter that might not be sharp enough, or a pizza where the cheese and sauce still oozed over the crust* (in which case you never could get equal slices).<p>* You can tell I haven't had lunch yet.",1332960431

3767685,comment,3767019,3767336,10,0,_delirium,,,"<i>Make a good-faith, high-quality edit to a page, and see how long the edit is allowed to stand.</i><p>I guess I haven't found this, but I admittedly don't try to edit [[George W. Bush]] or articles like that. The common case for me is crickets: I create an article on, say, a 19th-century German author who had a de.wikipedia article but no en.wikipedia one yet. Short article, maybe 2 paragraphs, one reference. The usual outcome is that I hear from nobody about the article ever again. No complaints, no praise, no reverts, no improvements, no anything at all. Exceptions: 1) it might get tagged as an ""orphan"" if nothing links in; and 2) some people may fiddle with the window dressing, adding/modifying categories and infoboxes and whatnot. Once in a long while someone will come in and expand it greatly, and that's usually positive.<p>My recent hobby has been articles about archaeological sites, and that has the same crickets-type feeling. So I'm wondering what new users are editing that they get <i>any comment at all</i>, much less angry ones! In my experience picking up a book and creating short new articles that reference the book is more than enough following-the-policies to avoid complaints about your articles, assuming it's some kind of legit reference book.<p>If anything, there are a lot of edits that <i>should</i> be challenged that aren't, with the bar for getting spam into Wikipedia not really that high. I know of at least one university that actually has a paid staff member creating total PR-puff-piece articles about that university's professors, and few of them get challenged, despite the fact that they read pretty much like a PR person wrote them, and are ""cited"" mainly to the subject's own articles and university press releases. Some academics edit Wikipedia solely to insert references to their own papers in articles. There are also rumors that publishing companies have people inserting references to the publisher's recent books, as a form of advertising rather than because they in good faith think it'll improve the article. Heck, check out the External Links section on popular vacation destinations; around 20-30% of them are full of travel spam, which isn't even that subtle, and yet manages to get in. Maybe all those false-negatives (not reverted) are worth not having more false positives, but it's a hard problem overall in both directions imo.<p>Really general articles, like [[global warming]], do have more fundamental problems, but I think some of them are just unavoidable. With anything controversial, there will be 50 different opinions about how the article should go, and the only way to reach a compromise is to discuss it and try to figure out how to best organize the material, split some material out to subsidiary articles, word controversial points delicately, etc. If someone who didn't read that discussion comes in and makes an edit, it's likely to be problematic on one way or another. I don't think that's even Wikipedia-specific; that's how things work when it comes to controversial subjects when people are writing academic review papers, subject-matter-specific encyclopedias, Linux kernel contributions, etc. Wikipedia's article on global warming is at least probably <i>less</i> bureaucratic to contribute to than the IPCC report is. ;-)<p>[edit: The above doesn't mean I don't think that there are problems with Wikipedia, which I do, but I think they're not quite as ""it's a completely horrible community"" as is often suggested. Some of the things, like reaching consensus on a controversial subject, are just inherently hard; other things that are broken for no good reason should indeed be fixed, others depend strongly on what kinds of articles you create, etc. Overall Wikipedia's newbie-friendliness actually seems pretty good relative to other collaborative projects I've been involved in, though.]",1332960085

Maybe I'm just building things where Django isn't appropriate, but for large stuff that need to integrate with legacy stuff, I would like avoid Django in the future.<p>Also, getting started on a Flask application is a lot more work than Django, setting up logins, permissions, database stuff and so on takes longer compare to Django. I would pick Django for something that just needs to be up and running quickly and with an okay admin interface.<p>If you start picking of core bit of Django, I personally think it starts to lose part of what makes it a handy framework.<p>But in the end your right, the framework isn't important, it's the product.

It seems like every Adobe press release these days is like a gorgeous chocolate cake...<p>...with cigarette butts stubbed out in it.<p>I write games in Actionscript every day, that's my day job and it was going to be my night job too.  The state of Flash development has never been worse than it is right now, and it is largely because of Adobe's utter incompetence at building tools for targeting the Flash VM.  Their documentation ranges from mediocre to horrendous, their frameworks have sprawled far too much, and the runtime is needlessly fragmented.  They threw in the towel on mobile development months ago.  Then they killed (more or less) their Linux support.  So much for write once run anywhere.  And what did they declare as their new strategy?  Games.  Console quality, AAA dev worthy games.  They're betting the whole flash ecosystem farm on people playing GPU accelerated, high quality games in the browser.  Not the worst idea they've ever had, but not particularly inventive.<p>Obviously they were going to have to make some money off of this new initiative, and I naively assumed that they would build a really great toolset for developing these games.  For some really ridiculous reason, I actually thought that they would get back in the business of building tools to let people create really great content (they haven't been selling the best tools for making Flash content for the last 4 years or so, so I thought maybe they would change that).<p>Instead we get this, the chocolate cake with cigarette butts stamped out in it.  I fully understand that Adobe have not had the time to actually develop a useful developer's kit for game dev targeted at the Flash runtime.  In fact, it might not ever be appropriate for them to do so.  But right now they are struggling mightily just to remain relevant, so it seemed natural to me that whatever they did come up with would really give devs an incentive to consider their runtime and workflow as a reasonable, efficient, and cost effective option.<p>Instead some greedy twit seems to have taken a gander at UDK licensing costs (25% off gross after your first 50 grand in revenue), and thought, ""we can charge that!""  If they offered a tenth of what UDK actually offers, then they might very well have been able to charge what they're going after--9% off net from pretty much all revenue in excess of 50 grand, virtual items, whatever.  How very generous of them.  But what are you actually getting for this big chunk of your profit?<p>You're getting Alchemy, a cross compiler that compiles C/C++ into AS bytecode to be executed by the Flash VM or a binary compiled for iOS.  Are you getting an industry leading developer's toolkit like Unreal?  An amazing engine? A version of Gears of War 3 or some other equally massive/ambitious game to use as a starting point to base your project around?  No, you'll still have to pay Unreal for that (or Unity or write your own game engine) and pay their licensing fees (remember, that's 25% off gross).  Alchemy was introduced years ago, and at the time, it was just a one man project (if that, it seemed like it was just a part time project at the time).  Cross-compile C and C++ into AS bytecode, sweet.  Cost: free.  I seriously doubt that this stopgap, bullshit, announcement has been preceded by considerably more development into Alchemy, and even if they have thrown dozens of people at the project for the last 6 months, it can't possibly justify the cost. I would think they would work for longer than 6 months on flagship product announcements that are the lynchpin for their entire damned roadmap, but at Adobe, roadmaps themselves don't seem to last that long.  So will any giant game developer actually use this?  I can't see how it's viable for them to use it at the public royalty rates.  Maybe Zynga can get a better licensing contract than us poor schlubs, but there's no way they're going to throw away 9% of their net after blowing through 55% on Unreal and Facebook's take before even considering their own costs.",1332957781

The order book consists of a number of standing orders, either orders to buy at $k or orders to sell at $j (k<j, with many distinct values of j and k).  These orders which sit on the book because they do not have a counterparty are called ""add liquidity.""  When you want to just execute the trade and you don't mind the spread, you place an order that crosses the spread and transact with the person who has the best standing order (selling for the least money or buying for the most money) of all the standing orders.  This is called ""take liquidity.""  My impression, which may not be correct, but which forms the basis for my previous response, is that the HFT industry primarily plays the add side right now and that most firms only take liquidity to close out positions when they are unable to close them out by adding liquidity.",1332957679

Of course, google may try (and/or succeed in) rolling their own, first.<p>But kudos to the scribd guys for delivering a simple twist on Napster/Flickr/YouTube (share music/photos/video) that no one else had done.  I expect they'll do very well out of it.",1178697185

20690,comment,20666,20669,0,0,sabat,,,"Great replies.<p>On the subject of CAPTCHAs: I'm seeing a lot of variations of this lately, like ""what is 2+3?"" in a graphic, or ""click on all the ducks"" next to 6 photos with 2 ducks. You get the picture.<p>I think CAPTCHA is on the way out. If we have to prove you're human, there are better ways than ""try to interpret this blurry, distorted graphic and type it here"".

Part of this is because a.) Houston has a multitude of separate central business districts that are reasonably distant from each other, and that b.) the greater Houston area is incomprehensibly HUGE (compared to what most people, even Americans, are used to). On a normal day without rush hour traffic, it can take nearly 1.5 hours to drive from what most Houstonians consider the West end of the &#x27;Houston area&#x27; (Katy, TX) to the East end (La Porte or Baytown, TX). It&#x27;s a 60 mile trip.

A reasonable parallel would be something like &quot;don&#x27;t be a hectomillionaire because you won&#x27;t be able to talk to your friends and family about the difficulties you have being rich.&quot;<p>The thing is, it&#x27;s true - a hectomillionaire can have emotional difficulties. Are their &quot;friends&quot; there for the friendship or for the money? When do you say no to a relative who continues to ask for a few thousand dollars? To friends who have a &quot;great business idea and just need some seed capital&quot;?<p>Similarly, being a parent, or a newlywed, or switching careers, or any of those other things can and often do come with their own emotional joy and struggles.<p>> &quot;All of these quotes are so absurd that they are meant to spur on the adventurous rebel.&quot;<p>My complaint about the essay is that it places the personal transformation that (sometimes) come from travel as somehow different and above the transformations associated with everyone else&#x27;s coming of age stories. As such, it encourages a snobbish attitude, which will worsen connection to friends and family who are sick of hearing how you met the Dalai Lama in India, or about how thing are so much better on the other side of the fence, I mean, ocean.<p>Instead of humblebrag, it could have given real methods for understanding the effects of culture shock, and how to cope with it &quot;back home&quot;, without ruining one&#x27;s relationship with others back home, and thus <i>prepare</i> the rebel instead of putting the rebel on a pedestal. (Which, admittedly, seems like what the target audience wants done to them.)<p>My views on the benefits of travel are much more mixed. A lot of people travel overseas, even as a 20-something, with little overall change. Friends of mine spent 6 months working for an NGO in South Africa, came back, and have no more desire for travel. I personally didn&#x27;t start my travels until I was in my 30s, self-employed, and a homeowner. And all those choices are great, including the choice to not travel.<p>The idea that since I waited until I was 31 to really travel overseas, on my own, means I was too old to &quot;change&quot; is ludicrous, and meaningless. Everyone changes.<p>BTW, I find your use of &quot;adventurous rebel&quot; interesting - based one what you&#x27;ve written, it sounds like the world traveler who starts at 32 is more of an adventurous rebel than one who starts at 22.",1437324008

It isn&#x27;t their problem if they paid in every year and the government did not meet its obligations.<p>It&#x27;s a lot more complicated than that. School districts can unilaterally give raises to teachers, which increases the tax-payer&#x27;s burden via additional pension obligations when that teacher retires. The most egregious form this takes are large raises in the few years before someone retires to &quot;supercharge&quot; their pension. Should the tax-payers be on the hook for obligations that were unilaterally created by local school districts? If a school board creates a new assistant/associate/full superintendent/principal position and elevates an existing teacher to that position, they&#x27;ve just added hundreds of thousands of dollars to the tax-payer&#x27;s bill in the form of additional pension obligations with no approval whatsoever.<p>People on public pension systems are owed a fair deal that gives them a secure retirement. Obviously at a minimum they should receive what they paid in, compounded yearly at 6.7% (adjusted for inflation). But they&#x27;re also going to have to bit the bullet for the greater good, just as I&#x27;m going to have to do when I lose at least 25% of social security when I retire.

Except their code will be far simpler since they can just read standard input and write to standard output, without having to worry about parsing https requests and constructing valid HTML just so that the results of their basic fizzbuzz code is visible. And they won&#x27;t need to worry about deploying a server, setting up the domain names, setting up a web server and so on.<p>Setting up a server is also more intimidating because you move into the world of things costing real money and your mistakes being publicly visible.

Fortunately, humans have been able to develop models that are able to assist us in predicting the future with some reliability (the seasons for help with farming, weather forecasting for a few days, etc), but being able to say &quot;over the next 30 years, we expect to earn an 8% average rate of return per year&quot; is in a whole other league.<p>It is true that defined benefit pensions are deferred compensation.  Problem is push comes to shove, the world doesn&#x27;t offer guarantees.  How much infrastructure will be neglected?  How many cuts to education will it take?  We all know the military won&#x27;t be touched, in any significant way.<p>Defined benefit pensions are a nice dream, if you ignore the possibilities of corruption (it&#x27;s still people controlling a huge pot of money, in an extremely opaque manner), not meeting expected rates of return, people living longer than expected, and finally....the tax base moving away or saying the hell with it, we&#x27;ll just change the laws to tax pensions or not pay them.",1437321854

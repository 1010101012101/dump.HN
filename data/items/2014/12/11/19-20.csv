8736748,comment,8735719,8735899,0,0,com2kid,,,"IMHO WinCE 6.0+ were pretty nice to work with. It could scale down to a system image that was just a couple of MB in size, and scale up to a full blown miniature version of Windows.<p>Prior versions of CE were a bit janky sure, but remember the sort of hardware it was meant to run on. Having a limited number of process slots isn&#x27;t the worst idea in the world if you are targeting just a couple MB of RAM!<p>I&#x27;d say that just like any other large legacy code base, CE had some good parts and some bad parts. Everyone on the (6.0+ at least) kernel team knew their stuff, as did the media codec team. I know the C Run Time for 6.0+ was good (I was on the test team for it ;) ).<p>The lack of a concept of a current working directory was interesting though, of course no smart phone today has such a thing (and we&#x27;d think people to be crazy if they requested it!) but the idea was so baked into parts of the Win32 API that it was a fair bit of a porting pain for developers.<p>Drivers were always a problem for Windows Mobile devices. I actually owned some rock solid high performing WinMo phones, but they were few and far in-between. My Motorola Q9h is still the best smartphone experience I have ever had, it felt /natural/ for me to use, I cannot say that of any other phone I&#x27;ve used since. Also it was lightening fast on just 96MB of RAM. WinMo crawled at 64MB, but it flew at 96MB!<p>As an example of what it was like from the inside trying to make everything work, when working on WinMo6.5, we couldn&#x27;t get our OEM partners to give us source access to their keyboard driver for us to make fixes for them to our test devices! (You ever try testing software when you cannot get hardware that it runs on? Ugh) They considered their keyboard driver to be &quot;secret&quot;.<p>These types of problems were a large part of the reason behind the decisions for MS to write the majority of drivers for Windows Phone. When they wiped all the code, and started out with a brand new kernel, the decision was made to limit SoC support to ensure platform stability.<p>And that there is the kicker about mobile development. Every single new platform is a whole new adventure when it comes to software stability. Because so much changes when platforms iterate, you have a lot of drivers that need to be written.<p>Traditionally on PC we&#x27;ve only had a handful of chipset manufacturers, and the field has shrunk considerably. But in the late 90s I remember certain VIA AMD chipsets having known stability issues (a large part of the reason why AMD went to making all their own chipsets and not relying on 3rd parties anymore), and more recently even Intel has not been immune to bugs in their chipset drivers.<p>Now that the mobile field has consolidated to just a few chipset vendors (although this is changing with a flood of Chinese chipsets finally reaching awareness amongst western companies) that iterate on a good schedule, well at least phones don&#x27;t just randomly reboot.<p>GPU drivers are still crap though, I&#x27;m not sure if the Windows Phone team still writes their own, but they sure as heck did for WinPhone7, there&#x27;ve been multiple posts on HN about Smartphone GPU driver bugs, I wish someone would test out WinPhone for those same issues! :)<p>tl;dr Aging embedded OS kernels don&#x27;t behave well when scaled to 15x what they were intended to do. Just when WinCE started to get really good (involving a complete kernel rewrite) it was de-emphasized by the company.",1418327993

8736726,comment,8735684,8736624,0,0,jerf,,,"Nested closures is a different problem than &quot;callback hell&quot;. Callback hell is  constantly dropping context on the floor with the stack frames, making every event handler like the &quot;goto&quot; that Dijkstra considered harmful. Nested closures, by comparison, are merely messy, but do not cause context loss. They <i>can</i> be refactored, it&#x27;s just one more level of abstraction to it than you may be used to, and is often probably not worth it. (For example, do you <i>really</i> need a function that you can pass a closure into and get another one back? Maybe, but that&#x27;s a level of abstraction than can be very cognitively costly; you better be getting some serious benefit for that cost.)<p>I have observed before that this sort of DSL-like usage can sometimes make people forget that they are dealing with plain old-fashioned language constructs that can be manipulated with other constructs. Languages like Ruby that allow this fact to disappear out of the source code completely seem to make this more likely. Go won&#x27;t let you forget you&#x27;re just creating a bunch of closures, but if you&#x27;ve been trained in an enviroment where a &quot;block&quot; is something special or in such a Ruby &quot;DSL&quot; you may have a way of thinking about these issues that inhibits proper refactoring. This is the general case of what okatsu observes before me, that nothing stops you from making real functions or methods to use as the methods.<p>Also, Go&#x27;s relatively recent &quot;bound methods&quot; are really useful for this sort of thing.",1418327703

But frustratingly, we don&#x27;t really know what the connection is, or if it has multiple factors--and if so, how those factors relate to one another. To date (to the best of my knowledge), reports of weight gain from people taking SSRIs have been anecdotal. There is a large enough sample size to draw a clear connection; the weight gain isn&#x27;t imaginary. (It occurs in about 25% of SSRI users, and the risk for weight gain increases over the duration of SSRI usage.) But there haven&#x27;t been controlled, clinical studies of of the effect. Do SSRIs affect metabolism in some way? Possibly. Do they affect appetite instead, or in addition to, metabolism? Possibly. Do they affect gut microflora? Possibly. Could be any of these things; could be all of these things; could be something we haven&#x27;t even hypothesized yet.

Some of the derived theorems provide for: reconfiguration of real-time multiprogrammed processes, communication between functions, and prevention of data and timing conflicts.<p><a href=""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1702333&tag=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D1702333%26tag%3D1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=170233...</a><p>And some NASA work related to HIOS: <a href=""http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19750010848.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/1975001...</a>",1418327356

In fact, I still don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve waited long enough, but I do at least feel good to say that it is working.<p>There&#x27;s a few things going on, and they&#x27;re specific to me.<p>Primarily, I&#x27;m a judgmental person. And mostly to myself. I judge myself really hard for not doing enough or going fast enough. This book is teaching me to stop doing that, even though it may sound &quot;heroic&quot; to always push myself. I think I get that impression from elite athletes, and I think &quot;well I should be doing that to myself so I can be the best at whatever I&#x27;m doing.&quot; At some point along the way, I forgot that most of what I learned wasn&#x27;t the result of that type of thinking. I learned everything from speaking to programming simply by doing, and not by judging myself in the process.<p>I would also say I&#x27;m impatient, but I think that&#x27;s the same thing as saying I&#x27;m judgmental.<p>This book is like written Adderall in that it causes the same calming effect. It teaches you that it&#x27;s okay to slow down and just do, and not worry about anything else in the present moment. I know that sounds kind of cheesy and &quot;Zen&quot; like, but I definitely have (self diagnosed) ADHD and I operate on two modes: one where I&#x27;m being productive and doing, and one where I&#x27;m learning. It&#x27;s really hard to context switch between the two. So it helps to know that when I&#x27;m learning, or doing certain types of activities that I&#x27;m not used to doing, it&#x27;s okay to go slower and not stress out about my perceived lack of progress. The net result: my work IMO actually ends up being better, and interestingly I learn faster because I&#x27;m not trying to do that so much.<p>Hope this helps.

It suffered from too-many-cooks syndrome after being started as an announce-first project. There was no clear direction, some people wanted it to be a distributed market, etc. After a couple of months, we thought it would be best to start from scratch with a small team on a focused implementation in Scala.

Nobody contacted us, so we decided the best course of action was to simply return the coins to the address they came from. That irritated a couple of people, but I still think it was the right thing to do, especially as the person who had originally collected donations had left and there was no clear governance setup for their use.<p>The original impetus for the project was to create a more robust and secure way for people to access bitcoin liquidity.

I grew up in the 70s in San Francisco, and two of my friends dads were professors at SF State, one in Physics, and one in Communications.  The physics professor owned a 4bedroom house in the inner sunset.  The communications professor lived in West Portal. They had kids raised a family largely on one income, kept the old station wagon running.  They weren&#x27;t rich, but it was not a big problem being a professor.<p>When that&#x27;s the case, when someone who manages to get a PhD has a strong chance at a good position where he or she can do good research without massive time pressure, and you can buy something like a 4br house in a nice place and raise a family, then it&#x27;s easy (well, easier) not to worry about who is living in the mansions in Pacific Heights.  You might grouse a bit, but you in the end, the professors probably wouldn&#x27;t trade places with them.<p>To me, the moral indignation comes from a number of things: 1) elite PhD programs in the sciences often have attrition rates of 50%, 2) it&#x27;s difficult to get (and keep!) a good job even if you make it through 3) the pay often isn&#x27;t sufficient to buy a house or raise a family even if you&#x27;re a winner on winner on winner (got into an elite program, completed program, got a tenure track job at a decent university) 4) congress&#x27;s response to this is to declare a shortage of PhDs.",1418325756

According to the CDC, as of 2012 &quot;more than one third of children and adolescents were overweight or obese&quot; so it logically follows that simply restoring the metabolic rate of adults to their teenage rates probably won&#x27;t help a sizable portion of the population.<p>Also, while it&#x27;s promising that this doesn&#x27;t increase heart rate or blood pressure, weight is just one factor in overall health. There are a lot of adults who are of a healthy weight but still aren&#x27;t very healthy. For instance, a healthy weight doesn&#x27;t mean that an individual has good cardiovascular health or functional strength. It&#x27;s a shame that so much emphasis is placed on weight when it&#x27;s really only a part of the equation and arguably not even the most important.<p>It&#x27;s kind of silly how we keep looking for a pill for appearance (weight) when it&#x27;s not hard to notice that people who focus on cardiovascular conditioning and functional strength usually have the healthiest looking bodies. Weight and body composition follow from healthy lifestyle; health does not follow from weight.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/obesity/facts.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/obesity/facts.htm</a>",1418325610

We want it to be there so that users have a really easy primitive to implement M.R jobs with.

8736501,comment,8736270,8736460,0,0,jdoliner,,,"Hi,<p>I wasn&#x27;t previously familiar with Irmin so I can&#x27;t say this with certainty but it looks like the data models of pfs and Irmin are very similar. They are targeting slightly different use cases though so I expect some performance details to be different. Irmin bills itself as a database so it likely has much faster point access than pfs and more interesting indexing options. Pfs on the other hand is designed to handle much larger filesizes than Irmin. (Irmin doesn&#x27;t list a limit but people don&#x27;t normally put TB size rows in their databases.)<p>The answer to your second question is also a big difference between pfs and Irmin. Although it&#x27;s currently unimplemented pfs is designed to leverage docker for its MapReduce implementation. Rather than implementing a Java class to define a MapReduce job as one does in Hadoop, in pfs you create a docker image with a webserver inside to define you MapReduce job. This makes it trivial to include whatever dependencies you want in your distributed computations.<p>Hope this clears some stuff up.",1418324919
8736500,comment,8732891,8735987,0,0,cbsmith,,,"> I have already admitted my obvious biases, but seriously - when you design such a trivially corruptible system, you can&#x27;t call it a persistent database; it&#x27;s at most a cache. It won&#x27;t survive a system crash at all, it probably won&#x27;t survive an application crash intact either. To call it persistent is laughable.<p>There are a number of use cases where in the event of a node failure it is better to rebuild from a replica or a log. Statistically, the RAM on another host is actually more reliable than local storage. Additionally, the database does have sync&#x27;ing primitives that allow for a variety of persistence strategies... just not the traditional ACID strategy.<p>In practice, there are <i>lots</i> of cases where the freedom to ignore transactional integrity is very handy, and yes, a cache would definitely be one of them.",1418324918

It is not the infinitely reproducible digital information at the end of the process that you use a legal framework to restrict distribution of. People <i>want</i> that, but information is no longer scarce, and to try to restrict it is unethical.<p>The valuable resource you have is your creativity. Your ability to <i>produce</i> that digital information is a scarce resource that few possess. The current model that most creators pursue is that an investor of some sort seeks to take advantage of the arbitrage the artificial implications that copyright imparts upon free markets to profit off the perpetual legal ownership of information, and pays you either a fixed salary or a fraction of the returns to actually produce the work, in exchange for the up front funding.<p>Kickstarter, patreon, gittip, etc are demonstrating the ability for consumers of information to also pay the scarce resource - the creation - themselves. And it would make a lot more sense for consumers to just pay for the culture they want to be made directly, and then everyone can experience it - rather than having some state institution doing it.<p>No, those current platforms are not appropriate to replace copyright. Of course they are not. They exist <i>under</i> copyright. We cannot conceive of what it would look like to have a legitimate free culture patronage service because one cannot exist right now. But I wrote this post and a bunch of others and keep debating the topic because I fundamentally have <i>faith</i> it would work, and that the ongoing cultural death of western civilization since the advent of perpetual copyright is much more detrimental to society than the free availability of Jersey Shore.",1418324754

1629155,comment,1628476,1628659,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Why pay $10's of K per year to go to college and then spend 20 hours/week waiting tables instead of studying?<p>There's an assumption here that if you're working, it'll cut from your studying time and make you worse off. In reality, the more you fill up your schedule, the better off you'll be. Adding a job, sport, and club will make you better at studying <i>and</i> you'll have as good of a social life because your rare free time will be so precious that you'll want to plan and spend it well instead of sitting around boozing or getting high. My Mom came from nothing - like, nine kids, no money at all - and waited tables through college, kept a solid B average, I was born before her senior year (my Dad was in grad school), and they both finished up and got into good jobs.<p>I dropped out of high school, got an almost full scholarship to university anyways, and pretty much screwed around with my free time - the only time I was ever locked in academically was when I was also training as a fencer for 20+ hours per week. Before I was a fencer, I screwed around. After I broke my hand, I screwed around some more and dropped out to start a company. A few years later I studied business with my own money, paying cash each semester while working at the same time. Then I studied a lot more seriously.<p>Working for money is cool. Not working and pretending you're going to study in that time is delusional - the habits built from working and keeping a job is probably better than extra study time anyways at building character and making you successful.",1282631777

since my question and content is a wee bit personal I've decided to post using a temp.<p>I am a 28 years old male and, as many here, both interested in and involved with tech and startups.
I am currently working daytime as a coder, and spend rest of the time coding/cofounding.<p>I have for a while now dated a girl, stunningly beautiful and eternally caring. Very much a dream come true for a mother in law... Except for one thing. One tiny yet life altering thing.
She is uneducated. Very much so.
She never finished elementary school (she's 21).
Now don't take this the wrong way. Most of my friends don't have a higher education - that's not really of importance. I find the character beneath far more important than a piece of document.
In this case though, with the girl - it makes it very difficult to communicate and share ideas.
Basic math, observations about languages, cultures, history and so on - there's nothing there. What breakes my heart and has kept me from loosing interest in her is that she is very interested in learing.
(Reason for her not finishing elementary is not because she couldn't handle it or dropped out. There were other issues. Family issues)<p>Sure we have fun and all but sometimes I feel the need to be understood. My cofounder does, perhaps that's enough?<p>My qustion isn't - what do you think I should do. That one I can handle myself. 
Rather - maybe you guys could share some thoughts and stories about the relationship between your partner and your startup.<p>How big of an impact have they had and in what way?",1282630676

Remember, you don't <i>have</i> to do everything yourself; maybe a year or two spent learning the basics would give you both a good foundation for the project, and the opportunity to meet, evaluate and recruit other people who may have better ME/EE skills than you, but not your clinical expertise.<p>Or as you say it's 'basically a solved problem', maybe you can just find someone and work together. Just lsat week I was recommending HN to someone with a Mech eng degree and who has family manufacturing contacts in Asia to get on HN because he's a great hardware hacker but doesn't enjoy programming so much. Depending on your location, I bet you could assemble a small research team here on HN fairly easily.

1387155,comment,1386629,1386629,0,0,boredguy8,,,"""what if some influential genius had recognized the threat and stood up and yelled Stop?""<p>I guess influential is defined by impact, so no influential genius could  do so. But the warnings were there, and are here. And have been here. It's been a long time coming, but Nietzsche wrote a century ago, ""The massive influx of impressions is so great; surprising, barbaric, and violent things press so overpoweringly--'balled up into hideous clumps'--in the youthful soul; that it can save itself only by taking recourse in premeditated stupidity.""<p>I've long liked that term, 'premeditated stupidity'. It certainly seems to fill the bill for most games. And why not, if one looks for refuge in their games? A moment of solace, of control (however illusory), where everything can once again <i>make sense</i>.<p>Did some digging and found what has been, for me, an influential essay on this topic. In ""Harper's"" April, 2002, Thomas de Zengotita writes, ""To get relief, you have to stumble into the Greyhound bus station in Albany, or some old side0street barbershop that time forgot, into someplace not yet subjected to the renovating ministrations of the International Red Brick and Iron Filigree Restoration Corporation. And 'stumble' is the key concept here. Accidental places are the only real places left.""<p>Sounds a bit like the meadow, except it becomes The Meadow, itself succumbing (at least in the minds of others) to the simple category fetishism that seems insurmountable.<p>""It would be irrelevant to object by asking, 'Well, how else are we supposed to do it?' There isn't any other way to do it. That's the point. This isn't a consultant's memo. This is a serious diagnosis of a serious condition. Would we rather not know about it because it happens to be incurable? This goes much deeper than subject matter, or political bias, the usual fodder. It determines the way we frame everything. Like all that is most profound in human custom, this agreement is almost physical, an attunement, more music than semantics. It instills and expresses, moment by moment, the <i>attitude</i> we bring to living in this world of surfaces.""",1275069502

So if you paste in a car ad url from cars.com it will parse the basic info for you (eg. mileage, price, make, model, etc).<p>The advantage here is the user can add their own fields which they think are relevant to a car search. So someone could add something like ""my comfort level in the backseat"" and anytime they add another car ad they could specify something like 'good','average','bad' which will be associated with that car ad so in the end they can sort things very easily and weigh their options better.<p>As for your alert idea, I can see that being an add-on product perhaps. However I know that most of the major new/used car websites provide alerting capabilities based on certain criteria, so that functionality may already exist.",1275069469

I remember when the statement Pabst made was that you were looking to get hammered for cheap (but maybe a step above ""cheapest"").<p>Perhaps of related interest, the Schlitz brand was snapped up a couple of years ago by a large distributor in the area, where one of the younger generation of the family business intended to relaunch -- returning to the circa 1930's recipe -- as a premium craft brew.<p>There appears to be a significant lingering value being assigned to these brands, regardless of their intervening depreciation.<p>I wonder just how sticky is the presence of such public brands.  And whether there is a common interval between their degradation and renewal; some timeframe short enough that they remain in the memory of a younger generation, but long enough that the accumulated or final negative connotations have been lost or don't carry significance with them.<p>In the tech world, IBM seemed to go through something somewhat similar with regard to brand when it sort of embraced open source (which surge in brand value we seem to be moving beyond).  And HP has worked to unbury itself from its ""Compaqification"".  Mentioning these is a stretch in terms of comparison, but the industry is young enough that the long term role of brands seems something of an open question.",1275067096

I was able to land a job in New York City while living in Puerto Rico. I do admit, however, this was partially due to some plain ol' luck - One of the startup's co-founders was actually travelling to Puerto Rico on vacation, so I was able to meet him personally and have an impromptu interview at the San Juan airport.<p>Two years later, I got laid off due to economic factors. This led to getting a job in the Bay Area. I had multiple phone interviews and a short programming test before getting the job, but I didn't have to fly over to California once.<p>The author does raise some good points, though. While I obviously don't have any proof, I have always suspected that some job offers were passed over me due to my location at the time, especially while in Puerto Rico (two prospective employers strongly suggested that I get a visa to work in the U.S. - ignoring the fact that Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory, making me a U.S. citizen). So while I would say it's a bit more difficult to go job-hunting in remote locations, it's definitely not impossible.",1275067055

My claim is that the odds that you individually will be selected by the lottery that I describe and then wind up with decisive power exceed the odds that the election will be so finely balanced that it comes down to one vote, in one state, and that vote is yours.<p>This is just the logical extreme version of dividing voters up into blocks called ""states"", and then dividing up politics so that one state is likely to decide it.<p>Back to the state version, in a million coin flips, a standard deviation is of size 500, and it is virtually impossible to deviate from the true average result by more than 1500 votes.  Therefore unless the popular vote in the deciding state is almost exactly balanced, and all other states are balanced, it is very difficult for any vote to truly be deciding.<p>The closest that the USA has ever come to what he describes as ideal is Florida in 2000.  However when it came down to a handful, was that good for democracy?  Not really.  There were endless arguments about who meant to vote for whom.  It is certain that an illegal voter purge changed that election result.  It is also certain that correlations between voting machine problems and socioeconomic status did as well.  (Please tell me a legitimate reason for a voting machine to have a switch - set differently in different precincts - where one setting immediately tells you if your ballot is spoiled so you get a second chance to vote, while the other silently accepts the ballot and discards the vote.  And then it was set to the ""silently not count you"" in black precincts which therefore had a much higher incidence of spoiled ballots.)<p>This is all ancient history at this point.

The US government just imprisoned a man for his connection with a video deemed ""offensive"" by that government -- if there was any criticism by anyone but a few right-wing cranks I missed it.<p>The man's nominal offense was a parole violation.  Whether the government's pursuit of the violation, or the sentence given, were typical for such violations is beyond my expertise.<p>However the government went out of its way to see to it that his arrest (pardon, ""brought in for questioning"") was known to and photographed by the press.  This was an obvious effort to communicate to elements abroad the distate of the government for the video.  Maybe he had to prosecuted on the parole violation -- if so, that could and should have been done much more quietly.<p>No one seems to regard this particularly important, which I find very strange.  One, anyone in the US who might want to say something ""offensive"" now has cause to wonder what opportunities they present to discretionary prosecution.<p>Two, and more important, the US government has just validated censorious behaviors of a great many governments.  How exactly are we going to complain to the Chinese or Egyptian government for jailing dissenters when we have made a point of doing just that?  Worse, we've just told all those dissenters that they cannot be sure that we will be supporting them if they get into trouble.<p>I don't really much care that his offense was nominally related to an international incident, or that he said means things about someone else's religion.  The whole point of ignoring such problems is to deny the government _any_ excuse for censorship.  Because once a government gets in the habit, it becomes quite easy to find excuses for the censorships it finds in its interests.<p>This was a shameful episode for Americans.

I know that's why I don't understand it.  I imagine if I did it might not be that hard to understand.<p>Most people's knowledge of the stack stops somewhere around C.  C hasn't changed for 40 years.  It's a portable assembly language, i.e. the common mental model is that each construct in C is a handful of assembly instructions on any processor.  But to get LuaJIT-type performance you have to understand exactly how the CPU works, i.e. pipelining and reordering, internal caching algorithms, internal branch prediction algorithms, and maybe to some extent multicore, although I guess LuaJIT is single-threaded like Lua.<p>Mike Pall's mental model is for sure not C (since a lot of it isn't even written in C), but the lower level CPU architecture.  And that has changed a lot in the last 10 years.  I think even if you coded a lot of assembly language in the 80's it wouldn't necessarily translate to working on something like LuaJIT.  My impression from skimming some online posts is that he has read hundreds of pages of Intel/ARM reference documentation from cover to cover, for multiple CPUs.  I think there are a limited number of people with the patience to do that, since it's non-portable and changes relatively quickly.<p>Another problem is I think that the open source tools that are available don't work at the right level.  Like when you are running profilers, they are helping you profile assembly code generated by a C compiler.  The performance characteristics he's taking advantage of are at a lower level.  I think you need CPU-specific performance counters and so forth, and there's a different way of getting those for each make/model.  Are there even open source tools that allow you to get this information?  I'd appreciate a pointer.<p>It's just a different level of abstraction than most programmers are working with.  Not that many people are even writing ""low level"" C these days, e.g. something like redis.  A lot of ""application level"" C code you see these days is old and/or not particularly fast.<p>I would be interested if anyone has any pointers for this style of code other than ""read a bunch of CPU manuals"". :)",1352769965

There are dangers both ways, though I feel the government should always be pushing a more progressive social agenda. Gay marriage is a great current example. Obama is doing it right by pushing for it. Gillard in Australia is doing it wrong by saying ""the people don't want it"" and axing any proposals. Obama is fighting upstream for what is right and Gillard is basically saying ""look, my hands are tied b/c the people don't want it"". It's a cop-out for making an unpopular but right decision.<p>In the case of free speech, there is little wiggle room, IMO. People need to be free to say what they want.

4775715,comment,4775117,4775484,8,0,azakai,,,"> Performance is bad enough without putting the JavaScript intermediary in there<p>Flash performance is a combination of code and graphics. Taking LightSpark or Gnash would not give you something that integrates in an optimal way with the browser's hardware accelerated graphics systems, you would need to do a lot of plumbing for that. So yes, the C++ might be faster than JavaScript, but the graphics might end up making it less performant overall.<p>Plus, the native code is nonportable and nonsandboxed. Portability might be the simpler of the two, but it is still not trivial these days to maintain a single C++ codebase across multiple compilers and OSes. Sandboxing is the big problem though: A fast ActionScript implementation must have a JIT, and JITs are extremely hard to secure. The browser already has a dynamic language JIT (for JS), so using that instead of adding an entire new one is far preferable. In addition, the C++ code must be secured too which takes effort and introduces risk.<p>So there are very good reasons for going this route. But I agree there are tradeoffs and benefits the other way too.",1352768831

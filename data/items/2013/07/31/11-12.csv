6133036,comment,6126926,6130163,2,0,aestra,,,"I have a data point of 2. I knew two waitresses. They both took home their tips at the end of the night, without sharing with anyone. One of them was required to only report 15% of her sales to the IRS for taxing, but always took home way way more than that, so she made tons of tax free income. Also the United States is a large place, there is different customs different places.<p>It&#x27;s pretty obvious what incentive the waitstaff has to provide good service, if they don&#x27;t, they get fired. Tipping is arbitrary. I tip the person who pours my drink at the bar, but not the person who pour my drink at McDonald&#x27;s.<p>Oh, by the way, when I was younger and in high school/college I worked three public facing customer service jobs where I didn&#x27;t earn any tips. I worked my ass off at each job for standard wages. I always provided the best customer service I could. My incentive was I wanted to do my job effectively and not get fired or reprimanded. It is incredibly naive to think that if waitstaff earned a fair wage without tips they would all suddenly stop doing their job. Especially since they already know they are going to get a tip anyways, it is pretty much required to give a tip, no matter how bad the service was!",1375271992

6133021,comment,6132502,6132502,37,0,bigiain,,,"I keep seeing articles like this and thinking &quot;these people are thinking about this wrong&quot;.<p>3D printers <i>aren&#x27;t</i> better at making mass produced injection moulded plastic objects than injection moulding. They can (more or less) replicate the sort of mass-produced thing you can buy on Amazon that&#x27;s been sailed here in shipping container loads from China  but if you&#x27;re going to make a few thousand of them (or better still, a few tens of millions), then &quot;the industry&quot; has got the efficiency of that manufacturing and supply chain down to a very fine art. (In the same way that it&#x27;s very difficult to match McDonalds on a calorie-per-dollar metric.)<p>What I believe will really make 3D printers &quot;go viral&quot;, is when enough people work out that there&#x27;s different, <i>new</i> <i>categories</i> of objects we can produce.<p>Things where only 50 or 100 people in the world are ever going to want - maybe a mount to fit an iPhone 4S with an extended battery case to the handlebars of a 2012 Vespa 125 Sport, or a bracket to hold an Arduino and a 2x40char LCD to the side of a pre 2005 Rancilio Silva espresso machine. I wonder how many things/objects get thought up, but discarded because &quot;it&#x27;ll got $x,000 to make a set of moulds, and there&#x27;s only 100 people in the world who&#x27;d even consider buying this&quot;?<p>I think there are also objects that right now don&#x27;t exist because existing manufacturing techniques don&#x27;t allow them to be (mass) produced - one of the cheaper 3D printers comes with a sample file of a Chess Rook (the &quot;castle piece) with an internal spiral staircase inside it - a geometry that&#x27;s physically impossible to create a mould you could extract the part from (without destroying the mould). I wonder how many things/objects get thought up then &quot;discarded&quot; because &quot;you can&#x27;t make that&quot;?<p>I see people trying to print 3D plastic guns using more or less &quot;traditional&quot; gun shapes and designs. That&#x27;s just <i>wrong</i> (though I have some grudging admiration for the people doing it for largely political/anarchist motivations). What we need is for people to start developing the knowledge and experience with 3D printing materials  so they&#x27;ve got the same sort of &quot;gut feel&quot; for sizes/configurations/suitability of various options to design parts, as &quot;old school&quot; welders have about what size/shape/configuration of steel stock and gussets/bracing is &quot;strong enough&quot; for your boat-trailer/golf-buggy/go-kart. People who can go &quot;that <i>might</i> work, but how about we over-engineer that section a bit more, &#x27;cause it seems a little close to the material limits&quot;. People who can go &quot;Lets 3D scan that metal bracket, then adjust the thickness of <i>those</i> planes and increase the gusset radius along <i>that</i> intersection, and add some webbing around <i>those</i> holes, then it&#x27;ll be &#x27;strong enough&#x27; to replace the original metal part&quot;.<p>I look forward to that  and I suspect it&#x27;ll start happening in a fairly short timeframe.",1375271721

Pages simply wastes fat less screen real estate that Word does giving you more room to see your actual document, and this is a recurring issue with Microsoft&#x27;s UI design. The contrast is particularly marked with the iPad, where you get more pixels for your document on the iPad&#x27;s 10&quot; screen than in Microsoft Word on a 15&quot; laptop screen.<p>Just look at the ribbon, toolbar, status bar, etc. Not only does this waste screen real estate, it wastes vertical space which is at a premium on widescreen displays.

Now, exactly 12 years later, he has been reunited with his family, thanks to Facebook.<p>Upset with his mother, Ankush had run away to Nanded, over 400 kilometres away from his Pune home. There he started serving the devotees at a Gurudwara. Impressed by his dedication and hard work, the guru there took him to Ludhiana where Ankush started living at the Reru Saheb Gurudwara. He donned a turban and was given the name Gurban Singh.<p>While living life as a Sikh now, Ankush kept searching for his family. His only means of contact was the telephone number of his uncle which he remembered - but it never got connected as the family had changed their house.<p>Ankush&#x27;s family - his mother, Hemlata and brother Santosh who is two years younger to him - also kept searching for him, but to no avail.<p>It was just two weeks ago that Ankush tried searching for his younger brother on Facebook. With many profiles by the name Santosh, he was able to identify his brother due to similar looks.<p>Ankush says he was able to convince his mother and brother by telling them about a scar on his face, which he had got as a child while playing near his house.<p>His guru in Ludhiana immediately made arrangements for him to travel to Pune from Ludhiana.<p>On seeing him in a Sikh avatar, neighbours and relatives did not believe the person in front of them to be Ankush. But for the Domale family, it was indeed a happy reunion.<p>Ankush&#x27;s mother was quick to recognise him from his style of walking and from the scar on his face. Excited, Ankush is now with his family in Pune. But just as his mother and brother don&#x27;t want him to leave, Ankush too doesn&#x27;t want to leave his guru who stood with him in his bad days and took him in his stride, leading him to a right path.",1375270611

If, on the other hand, I visit their website and some invisible actor (say, an advertiser) also tracks me, then it becomes insidious, especially if that other invisible actor is active on multiple sites.<p>This gets a bit blurred when you&#x27;ve got large vendors with multiple presences. For example, years ago when you logged into Hotmail, you&#x27;d be briefly redirected via passport.com (then live.com), and then directed back to Hotmail. Similarly, going to Microsoft&#x27;s web page, or MSN&#x27;s, or Technet, or any other site in the Microsoft stable, would redirect via the same site. This gave them single-sign-on, but also allowed them to &quot;track&quot; your activity across the entire network. That behaviour is used by many other large organisations such as Google.<p>However, it&#x27;s also made its way into other large sites like Facebook and Twitter, because sites like that have &quot;social media buttons&quot; appearning on sites that aren&#x27;t served by those sites but are served by Facebook and Twitter, so becoming third-party objects, and doing the same sort of pervasive insidious tracking across multiple domains and web properties.<p>The thing is, Google Analytics (as mentioned in the article) is such a pervasive ubiquitous invisible actor, but it&#x27;s damn useful, so lots of people want to use it. The problem is that it&#x27;s a third party object, and it&#x27;s of massive benefit to Google too, not just the site owner.<p>So, where &quot;do not track&quot; fails is in distinguishing between &quot;tracking&quot; that&#x27;s acceptable to many people, and &quot;tracking&quot; that&#x27;s somewhat more invisible and pervasive. Switching it all off is harmful to the internet, but until it&#x27;s sold correctly, it won&#x27;t be acceptable otherwise.",1375270245

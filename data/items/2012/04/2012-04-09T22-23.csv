At the same time, other nation's sovereignty should not be violated by these laws.<p>The basic situation is that the ease of communication that the internet provides means that law enforcement is facing a sisyhean challenge if it plans to fight this criminality with sticks.

Being an intelligent person, Steve compares the risk of dying from neglect, versus dying from treatment, as apples to apples.  Do you?<p><i>There are (apparently) 1210 billionairs in the world.

Ie, it would be impossible to absolutely absolutely 10^7 know which was which.  It might be possible for an intelligent person to make a good guess, however.<p>This is how technique advances in any technical field that can't be reduced to pure mathematics.

You need to consider the research in the broader picture. Cancer is a genetic disease (in terms of pathological origin, not necessarily in hereditary terms).

So in what way did it contribute to what you know now?  In no way, which makes it useless - if you hadn't done the work then, expensively, you could do it now, trivially.

Yes, it is way easier to take photographs as the cost of learning has dropped significantly. But that doesn't mean that there aren't photographers who make great pictures and should get paid, especially if the company that wants to use it is a big enough company to have a budget to sell 20,000 calendars.<p>I disagree with the notion though that anyone can reproduce the photos he took (assuming the header image is one he did take) without investing a significant amount of time and resources into learning about photography. It's not as though he went into the mountains, waited for near sunset and then snapped the photo and went home. It obviously took some degree of planning and effort to do. I like to think I'm at least a decent photographer but I can tell you that even though I have equipment that was probably unimaginable in the 90s, I'm far from being able to take pictures of that kind of quality.<p>I know most software developers _hate_ it when clients quote them something like $100 to redesign an online store and I hear this argument all the time: ""If the programmer in some third world country can do it for $100, why can't you? That's what the market bears.""<p>Because what you're giving them at least (hopefully) is some quality engineering and your previous experiences that is worth more than what the $100 that other developer is charging.<p>If that company doesn't want to pay $X for the photographer's picture, it's very simple, they don't have to use it.<p>If a client doesn't want you to pay $Y for an online store, they don't have to hire you.<p>I don't get why there is always a big backlash against the photographer in these articles who are trying to make some money just like the rest of us.

3819586,comment,3816385,3819234,6,0,gruseom,,,"Hmm, good question. I'd say it's less true of bottom-up programming because there you're generalizing code you've already written. It's possible to get that wrong, i.e. introduce abstractions that capture what was there before but don't make it easier to write the program going forward, in which case the best thing to do is rip them out and replace them with their compiled equivalents until a better idea emerges. But it's all very incremental and the cost of getting any individual construct wrong is relatively low.<p>Classical DSLs are harder because of the D. You have to nail the domain/language fit or it's more trouble than it's worth. Even then you don't necessarily win enough to justify the cost: a specialized language needs to be significantly better than ""just coding your domain model in your general-purpose language"", which is a high bar. There isn't only the cognitive cost of learning a specialized language, there's the interoperability hit (can a general program call the DSL and vice versa), lack of tool support and so on. It doesn't make sense for most domains, especially business domains that don't lend themselves to technical notation.<p>The thing that bottom-up programming has taught me, not that I'm in any way sophisticated at it, is that good language constructs need to be an order of magnitude more lightweight than good application constructs. Application constructs are what you pack in your car for a road trip, language constructs are what you put in your backpack for a hike. Or another metaphor: application constructs are factory equipment, language constructs are hand tools - if you have to think about how to use it, it sucks. I find it's hard mentally to go back and forth between these two design levels. I'm spending a few days at the language level right now so these things are on my mind.",1334010484

They are not trying to cure pancreatic cancer - they are trying to cure Steveoma.</i> 
You're absolutely right that this is the mentality that future treatments need to take. In terms of treatment response, a liver tumour could have far more in common with a brain tumour than another liver tumour - the anatomical pigeonholing of cancers is a throwback to pre-molecular diagnostic times (so about 5-10 years ago and before) and is something that will hopefully change over time.<p><i>They can find an exploit in Steve's cancer genome on Wednesday, design a molecule to hack it on Thursday, synthesize it on Friday and start titrating it into the patient on Saturday.</i> 
If this time frame were possible this would be ideal, however, unfortunately each of these steps (if they are possible) takes significantly longer than an evening, and typically far longer than a patient has.<p><i>Moreover, Steve isn't on just one drug. He's got thirty or forty teams attacking every vulnerability, theoretical or practical, that may exist in his cancer cells.</i>
This is a risky game. How do I (the scientist) know which drugs were effective? How do I know how they'll react with one another?  If my focus is Steve, then do I really want to risk killing him through an unexpected cross reaction of my 30-40 untested drugs?<p><i>Not everyone is a billionaire. But if you do this for enough billionaires, the common elements in the problem will start repeating and the researchers will learn a repertoire of common hacks.</i> How many billionairs? There are (apparently) 1210 billionairs in the world. So say they all get cancer and get this team of doctors - if any of the patients survive then some aspect of the treatment worked. If they don't some aspect failed. It would be impossible to determine which is which. Considering the heterogeneity in terms of cancer genetics, 1210 would tell you very little at the genetic level.<p><i>You'll note that a lot of cancer patients die anyway.</i> But a lot fewer than used to.<p><i>The entire process we call ""drug development"" is an attempt to gain six-sigma confidence that we are not practicing quack medicine. Especially for cancer, do we need all these sigmas? And are we obtaining them in an efficient way? I can't imagine how anyone would even begin to argue the point.</i> This is not the problem with drug discovery (or correct).<p>[TL/DR]
There are aspects of this which ring true (reproducibility is an issue, although how you measure it is also a source of contention, and mouse models have their downside, certainly), however, there are also gross assumptions and misunderstandings which would make this course of action as ineffective as it would be expensive. There is an absolutely imperative need to begin to asses and describe cancers as more related to a patient than a disease title, you are quite right. But to forgo basic research in favour of arbitrary treatment-come-experiments would be to dismiss the last 100 years of biological research which have provide us in a position where you can make your argument. A combined focus of translational and basic research is essential, with a frequent and effective dialogue between the two.<p>Ultimately, your argument assumes the rate of discovery will be constant. You need to consider the research in the broader picture. Cancer is a genetic disease (in terms of pathological origin, not necessarily in hereditary terms). It cost the (publicly funded) human genome project $3bn to sequence a human genome in about 12 years. Now it costs $5000 in a week or so, and both the cost and the time is coming down. As I said before, it is an exciting time to be a cancer biologist.<p>-- I can't reply again, but, um, are you trolling?",1334010095

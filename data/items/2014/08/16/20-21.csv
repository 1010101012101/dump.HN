8187554,comment,8186924,8187253,1,0,jsolson,,,"> It&#x27;s worth noting too that Seattle and Washington don&#x27;t have income taxes, which can be a substantial issue for many tech workers.<p>This, combined with the substantially lower cost-of-entry on home buying are the main things keeping me in Seattle. In particular the income tax means that even a substantial bump in the number at the top of my paystub doesn&#x27;t necessarily translate into a bump at the bottom, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t after I look at what it would cost me to buy a home in a part of San Francisco similar to the condo I own here in Seattle. There&#x27;s also the commute: right now I have a ~15 minute drive to work compared with the ~one hour (I think, roughly? I&#x27;ve only done it a few times when visiting) it takes to get from downtown SF to the Googleplex.<p>One of the nicer bits (in my opinion anyway; I know it&#x27;s not shared by everyone) about the new housing going up in Seattle is that it&#x27;s mostly replacing one-story retail with multi-story retail+residential, and they&#x27;ve incentivized developers to preserve the facades (street feel) of the original buildings with new interiors that are up to code w.r.t. earthquakes, etc. Yes, the buildings are bland and the apartments in them are expensive and sterile, but <i>if</i> it can get ahead of the influx of engineers coming into Amazon we might stem the tide of rising rents in older residential properties in the area.",1408222653
8187553,comment,8186011,8186011,2,0,massappeal,,,"This is a very complex question; I&#x27;ll see if I can help.<p>Before I begin though, let me just say that you could take an entire undergrad and postgrad course on the economic, social and political development of Africa, because non-African nations have almost as much to do with the current state of Africa as the African nations.<p>Let&#x27;s start by addressing why some countries are poor.\nThere are many reasons some countries are poorer than others, and I would hate to over-generalize, but I&#x27;m going to. Access to International Trade, having resources worth trading Internationally for, the domestic resources available to develop a valuable workforce and a stable and effective form of governance.<p>Generally speaking.<p>Malawi for instance. Even if it had some tremendous resource it could sell in International markets, there aren&#x27;t any regional buyers to pay for the development of further infrastructure. It doesn&#x27;t have direct access to major trading centers and routes. If it wanted to develop a workforce to export something of value that wasn&#x27;t dug up from the ground, it would need investment in order to pay for the education, infrastructure, etc. And that gets us into foreign aid and development banks, but we&#x27;re just going to avoid that for now.<p>But even if it had all of that, the purchasing power of International markets greatly effect the International distribution of wealth.<p>Great example: The U.S. is one of the top oil-producing countries in the world. Despite this, we continue to import almost all of our oil. Why is this? Because American energy companies make more money by selling our oil internationally than they would domestically, so they do, and we end up buying cheaper oil from somewhere else.<p>Even if Malawi was swimming in some resource, maintaining domestic ownership of said resources and making it cheap enough to compete with countries that heavily subsidize certain industries can make it impossible to repeat.<p>Another great example of this: NAFTA.<p>The North American Free Trade Agreement is a FTA between Canada, U.S. and Mexico. We promised Mexico that by enacting this agreement, American companies would move all their factories from Asia to Mexico, employing millions. What happened though was that even after NAFTA, it was still cheaper for us to manufacture in Asia. But what the U.S. and Canada got in exchange for the &quot;promise&quot; was the removal of import tariffs on Financial Capital and Corn, among other things. As it happens, the U.S. subsidizes the Corn industry here to the tune of $9-12b per year.<p>As a result, it became cheaper for Mexico to import Corn from the U.S. than it was to buy domestically. And in case you don&#x27;t know this, Corn (&quot;maize&quot;) is a huge staple of Mexican agriculture. They make everything out of corn. So now, all of a sudden, Mexico has millions and millions of unemployed farmers. Who do you think has been rushing to the American borders all these years?<p>On top of that, by allowing us to freely invest in Mexican companies without tariffs, American banks purchased controlling interests in almost all of Mexico&#x27;s highest-grossing companies. So anytime a Mexican company makes money, the revenue flows back to NYC, rather than back into Mexico.<p>I tried to keep that simple and direct. I&#x27;m sure I missed some details on a lot of that, so please correct where I erred.<p>Hope this helped!",1408222626

8187441,comment,8187106,8187419,2,0,gamegoblin,,,"EDIT: This is wrong<p>I initially thought the same thing, due to the use of `map` as something of an equivalent of the Haskell `bind` (>>=) operator. It reminded me of just using `fmap`.<p>But no, they are using it as a full monad. Consider the type of fmap:<p><pre><code>    Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b\n</code></pre>\nand the type of (>>=)<p><pre><code>    Monad m => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b\n</code></pre>\nThe key difference is the function argument. In a Functor, the argument is (a -> b), but in a Monad, it&#x27;s (a -> m b). The distinction is that when you `fmap` a function over a `Just` value (`Some` in Rust), you always get back a `Just` value, but when you bind a `Maybe` value into a function, you might get back a `Nothing`.<p>So don&#x27;t let Rust&#x27;s use of `map` deceive you -- it seems to be the same as (>>=).<p>That being said, I&#x27;d be interested to see Rust introduce something akin to do-notation syntactic sugar.<p>=======<p>EDIT: I am wrong, the `map` function is basically equivalent to `fmap` and it seems the `and_then` function is similar to (>>=).

They have a lot of moving parts.<p>The thing I like about React is that it&#x27;s just a view layer, and can be a very simple one at that. A beginner could start putting things on the screen very quickly, then pick up a framework or larger app architecture later on. Not only is it a way to get started quickly, but the core concepts of a view layer learned through React would be applicable in larger frameworks.",1408219561

Auto correction? Can you easily embed weird content and expect it to work on the other side (drag stuff from Excel..)? It sucks, but that&#x27;s what happens day in and day out.<p>And you ignore the server side. AD is really not that bad. Better than most &#x27;virtual users on postfix&#x27; setups, if you go beyond a family or tiny team. Now you need the other server features. Calendar (w/ sharing, rights management -> AD?). Decent sync and push (IMAP IDLE is the closest you might get, I guess) for mobile clients. Delegation (i.e. &#x27;You can write in my name&#x27;) and out of office replies that don&#x27;t require Joe User to write sieve scripts.<p>I run my own setup and I am NO fan of Outlook/Exchange, but trying to replace what they do with a random selection of OSS tools will probably fail (and hence they couldn&#x27;t do it in Munich).",1408219504

Just spot a word on a nearby poster or sign, then look away...and spell the word to yourself backwards. The longer the better. I found it helped to rouse into an alert state, as you have to think about breaking the word into chunks. I also found it helped focusing the &quot;minds eye&quot; to visualise segments that could be picked off in reverse.

They like the choice of being able to choose from different distributions and their own desktop model.<p>Ubuntu is probably the closest to being a consistent desktop environment and look how much grief they get from some Linux users over their UX choices. The open source model works for software, but it can&#x27;t work for UX or design (at least I&#x27;m not convinced it can) because you can&#x27;t design by commitee - any yet everyone wants a say in the UX.<p>Would it have been better for Munich to have specified open document or data formats rather than the choice of software? This is what the UK government has recently done [1]. The choice of software is up to the individual departments as long as the software can read or create the open formats etc. At least this gives you the choice of switching to dfferent software without being tied to a single vendor&#x27;s closed-sorce document format.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/open-enterprise/2014/07/huge-win-for-odf-lets-not-mess-it-up/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/open-enterprise/2014/07/hug...</a>",1408219351

I went from exchange to dovecot IMAP for email with no calendar or contact implementation all hosted by me on a Linux box on Linode. I used Mail, iCalendar and address book.<p>About 2 weeks after setting that up I got pissed off with it as managing contacts and calendars was messy to say the least so I did some research and for a CalDAV and CardDAV server together. This never worked properly and was a bastard to integrate and manage.<p>So I said screw all this shit, moved it all to Google Apps laboriously and bought a Moto G phone. Now someone sends me an ICS file, I can&#x27;t add it to my calendar as nothing opens ICS files on the device, I keep losing contacts and everything wants my contact list. Not only that, every attachment I was sent means I had to upload the thing to Google docs and convert it before I could open it in sheets/docs.<p>So here I sit this evening with my broken Lumia 820 and a Torx T4 replacing the screen and a fresh Office 365 account.<p>That was the last thing that <i>works properly</i> for me. I imagine they&#x27;v gone through the same hell.<p>Whilst I understand that not all workflows are like that and this is an anecdote, I appreciate what compatibity does for people and why ecosystems are persistent.",1408219208

It&#x27;s a refreshing reminder of the days when programmers couldn&#x27;t rely on raw hardware speed to make something like this run as smoothly as it did.  They routinely had to invent their own clever (or sometimes not-so-clever) performance hacks, and what&#x27;s really impressive is how well they remembered those hacks even a decade later.<p>It&#x27;s a wonderful thing that we now have faster hardware, and better knowledge of how to solve these kinds of problems cleanly, and more available libraries/frameworks to encapsulate that knowledge.

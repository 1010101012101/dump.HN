Can you point me towards that list?<p>More importantly, has Google shown genuine interest in supporting embedding v8? Their last blog post about this was in 2012.<p>As for libuv, I would rather use a battle tested version, than stay on the bleeding edge. Threading is hard, and race conditions are rarely caught by tests. I&#x27;m happy to let others break their production and identify the regressions before I commit to it.<p>Wanting to use proven software has no relation to using the &quot;oldest&quot; version. As software is used, bugs are found. The longer you wait to transition to using new features, the fewer bugs you will encounter when you make the transition.

Van Gogh was innovative in his use of color, a characteristic clearly developed as an adult, and yet you dismiss it because he drew as a child.

Conrad must surely have written in Polish and French (yet published nothing and left no manuscripts), which surely undermines the excellent storytelling abilities and remarkable prose he developed <i>after</i> he stopped working a full time job.

So your best bet would be to modify existing browsers. That said, if content modification isn&#x27;t required -- and all you want to do is snoop on SSL, you can use SSLKEYLOGFILE in NSS-based browsers like Firefox and Chrome. If legitimate, I&#x27;d prefer going the extension route: people want you in their browser, so you can walk them through whatever it takes to install you, or provide pre-made profiles with you enabled. The point of encryption is to avoid spying and while most users (as evidenced here) don&#x27;t actually check that the HTTPS website certificate is what it claims to be, pretending to be the same site is about all you can do to modify content and MITM. I&#x27;d also point out that the problem here isn&#x27;t so much that they&#x27;re MITMing as that they&#x27;re doing it really, really poorly.

9080570,comment,9074737,9080064,0,0,agentultra,,,"> Yeah, lots of this is just swapping out one awkward keyword for another.<p>Many a well-intentioned Lisper eventually begins to see deficiencies where there are none and attempts to improve their implementation of choice. Common Lisp is one such target because people coming from in-vogue languages are used to the language changing every year or two. Invariably this leads to superficial changes at best which are enabled, surprise of surprises, by Common Lisp because it was designed to be extensible.<p>My theory is that if your language of choice needs to change its grammar rules to introduce new features you&#x27;re basically admitting that you should have added macros programmatic access to the reader.<p>> It&#x27;s almost like lispers want the opposite of java, long verbose keywords and syntax and then as short as possible variable names.<p>Well <i>syntax</i> is at a minimum in Common Lisp. It tends to avoid syntactical short-hand. The most common I know of being QUOTE, BACKQUOTE, UNQUOTE, UNQUOTE-SPLICE, and FUNCTION: &#x27; ` , ,@ and #&#x27; respectively.<p>If you read the preface to the first edition of <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i> I think you will find an enlightening explanation of, <i>Why Lisp?</i>. To paraphrase a brief summary: there are very few ways to form compound expressions and hardly any syntax at all so that the programmer can get to the problem at hand within an hour: the language disappears.<p>The longer names are chosen stylistically based on the maxim that computer programs are meant for humans to read and only incidentally to be executed by a computer.<p>Lisps are not, contrary to popular mythology, list-processing languages. It&#x27;s a symbolic language. The relationship between symbol and data allows the programmer to think primarily about the transformations to data without the abstractions becoming weak.<p>> Why not switch the parens to something that&#x27;s a single keystroke?<p>You could. Common Lisp gives you access to the reader. You can write a more fitting syntax you are more comfortable with.<p>I&#x27;ve written reader macros to parse assembler instructions for an emulator I wrote in Common Lisp.<p>> this just seems to be moving things around, not really improving anything<p>That&#x27;s my impression too. These sorts of experiments are worth trying from time to time in order to see if something can come from them. Maybe something will come out of this.<p>But ultimately people bike-shed over &quot;car/cdr&quot; and specialized functions for specific data-types (ie: AREF, GET-HASH, etc). You can write higher-order functions to abstract away sequence access and iteration if you want: people have and there are good libraries for it.<p>The standard hasn&#x27;t changed AFAIK because:<p>1. It&#x27;d be expensive and nobody wants to fund another ANSI committee.<p>2. There haven&#x27;t been any significant proposals the necessitate revisiting the specification.<p>People complain about the lack of run-time support for concurrency and IO in the specification. I don&#x27;t think they realize, coming from other languages, that Common Lisp doesn&#x27;t need it. The specification defines the language and a minimal ball of mud for doing practical work with it. Things like concurrency, threading, and IO are implementation issues and have been solved by high-quality open-source implementations for quite some time. We even have good libraries that provide a cross-platform layer to things like threading.",1424443286

And what if, when considering that set of theories, you were able to prove that any theory matching those criteria had to be equivalent (isomorphic) to a certain theory.<p>(This is like saying that the theory of basic algebra using equations and the theory of curves on graphs using geometry can be proved equivalent (isomorphic) by defining how to graph an equation and how to derive the equation for a graph.

9080476,comment,9079415,9080275,0,0,divegeek,,,"I find it useful to keep in mind the notion that all knowledge is gained by a process of guesswork and criticism.  When you listen to my voice or read my words, you must guess at what I mean to convey, because my words by themselves, even if not mumbled, are almost never sufficiently precise to carry my meaning.<p>So instead, you have to build and discard internal explanatory models of my meaning, criticizing them by cross-checking them with other things I&#x27;ve said, and with your understanding of my understanding of the world.  Meanwhile, I&#x27;m doing the same thing on the other side, hypothesizing the models that you&#x27;re creating based on what I&#x27;ve said and trying to add more words to fill any gaps in what I presume that you&#x27;re presuming that I mean.<p>When we arrive at a point where you and I both believe that you hold a consistent mental model of what I wished to convey, then we believe that I have communicated to you.<p>Stated that way, it&#x27;s clear that communication is really, really hard -- even though we do all of that model building and evaluation without conscious effort in most cases.  And it&#x27;s also quite obvious why it&#x27;s easier to communicate with people you know well, because both sides have a better mental model of the other&#x27;s mental model.  Both are _wrong_, always, but they&#x27;re less wrong than similar situations between people with less shared context.<p>This view also makes it abundantly clear that it&#x27;s important to validate communication.  If you restate to me in your own words what you believe I intended to convey, there&#x27;s a good chance I&#x27;ll catch any major discrepancies between what I intended and what you got. A good chance, but we can still end up believing that we&#x27;re in agreement when we&#x27;re not.<p>In theory it is possible to define a language and communication techniques that do not depend on this iterative, contextualized method.  This is essentially what we do in formal languages, such as those we use in mathematics or programming.  But it is not how people communicate because it&#x27;s actually far more efficient to rely on compression via shared context than it is to communicate with formal precision.  Further, formal communication only obviates guesswork and criticism at the level of understanding which is directly expressed.  I can read an assembler program and understand with perfect precision what the individual instructions do, but the leap to understanding the goal of the program again requires guesswork and criticism.<p>As an aside, it&#x27;s interesting to note that the process of guess-and-evaluate is essentially the same as the scientific method of hypothesize-and-test and even the same as the evolutionary method of vary-and-select.  There&#x27;s a compelling argument that all knowledge creation occurs via this process -- and communication is knowledge creation, even if it simply conveys an idea from one brain to another, because there&#x27;s no direct transfer mechanism the receiver of the idea must create it based on observations of the words of the giver.",1424441978

Sure super rich can only utilize fraction of their wealth however rest of the wealth rarely gets utilized to increase productivity of the society. The majority of investments in their portfolios (as per Piketty&#x27;s carefully collected data) are actually in non-productive activities such as real estate, hedge funds, HFT, derivatives, commodity manipulation and so on. These investments manipulates markets such as real estate to perpetually increase value of their investments without positive impact on society. In fact, from analysis of Piketty&#x27;s data it was found that if wealthy people only invested in &quot;productive&quot; instruments then their wealth accumulation would dramatically deaccelerate. So the argument that wealthy provides most of their capital for economy to bloom is fairly misleading. They do provide this capital for some GDP growth but it&#x27;s fairly small part of their investment portfolio. The major portion of the portfolio has singular goal of generating massive passive income perpetually for generations by activities such as artificially limiting supply side or ballooning demand side in markets such as real estate. There are no known social advantage of these kind of investments. Next time when you send that $3000 mortgage payment, put a note there: &quot;wealth transfer for 1%&quot; :).

Annoyingly they also negate the alcohol (but not the alcohol hangover), so you might as well not drink when you&#x27;re using those. Waste of money and the hangover is going to be bad enough anyway.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest that kind of night out more often than every few months though. Whereas you can safely have an alcohol night out several times a month.<p>That said, as my workouts became more strenuous, my drinking has declined and almost completely stopped. I still drink alcohol on some occasions, but it affects my performance too much to be done regularly. And I don&#x27;t have time to deal with the hangovers of other drugs, throwing an entire day away for a few hours of fun is not worth it [anymore].<p>And never forget: &quot;People say you don&#x27;t need to drink to have fun ... well you don&#x27;t need running shoes to run, but it fucken helps&quot;.",1451813776

You start to think the way the language works, and it just takes off. But reading this description, I have a bit of decent insight into the process, and I sorta get how it&#x27;s possible.<p>I agree that subtitles are basically chaos and noise; if you&#x27;re trying to learn another language, it&#x27;ll throw you right off. See my other answer to &#x27;mkaziz&#x27; one level up.<p>The context thing is very interesting. On the one hand, it can seem incredibly intuitive to want a perfectly flat, scopeless index into memory and facts, but it&#x27;s functionally impossible (with computers right now too - web and other large index searches go through MapReduce and similar. When we can directly search all of RAM in realtime life will be very different!). But, context is vital to mental organization, and I&#x27;ve observed this to amusing effect when I have, on many, many occasions realized I&#x27;ve used the same terms or acronyms in different contexts in technology and not realized the connection :P<p>I don&#x27;t read magazines, so scene websites like Reddit-in-whatever-language will have to fill in there. But the Web moves quite a bit faster than print (hours as opposed to many days, in some cases) which might help a slow beginner keep up with trends, but I can imagine it becoming an overload quickly, especially with places that talk entirely using slang and/or memes.<p>The bit where you mention how your brother &quot;forced himself to do it&quot; and succeeded is strongly reminiscent of neuroplasticity literature, which describes a sort of anti-plateau point where for a short period no progress appears to be made in spite of continued concerted effort, and then suddenly (eventually) results begin to snowball.

This has the effect of pushing all people that drive between 60 and 70mph out of lane 2 and into lane 3, where the average speed is between 70 and 80mph. This, in turn, pushes slower moving traffic into Lane 4 (inside lane) where its not uncommon to see people driving between 80 and 90mph.

7494676,comment,7494015,7494606,4,0,jallmann,,,"It sounds the real problem is there might be a <i>lack</i> of production caliber load balancers for $MQ, rather than HTTP possessing any intrinsic advantage.<p>How is load balancing anything but an implementation detail, since one can usually be written as a service utilizing the same protocol in question? That&#x27;s how HTTP reverse proxies usually work (notwithstanding other methods of balancing load such as DNS).<p>Other monitoring aspects such as feedback are already built into well-designed MQs. If that feedback isn&#x27;t being acted upon properly, then that&#x27;s again a problem with the implementation -- the same could be said for a HTTP-based task queue that simply ignores errors.

This is probably not literally true numerically, but in terms of things I hear about, are accessible to me (usually for free), and easy to get to, I run into a lot more, despite being a foreigner who doesn&#x27;t even speak Danish, which you&#x27;d think should be a handicap.<p>There are <i>always</i> interesting talks and meetups happening, from regular events like SpilBar (<a href=""http://english.dadiu.dk/invitation-spilbar-14-0-surprise"" rel=""nofollow"">http://english.dadiu.dk/invitation-spilbar-14-0-surprise</a>) or Science & Cocktails (<a href=""http://www.scienceandcocktails.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scienceandcocktails.org</a>) to active hackerspaces (<a href=""https://labitat.dk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://labitat.dk</a> and <a href=""http://www.illutron.dk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.illutron.dk</a>), a whole building hosting an indie-game community (<a href=""http://www.dfi.dk/nyheder/filmupdate/2010/velkommen-til-spilhuset.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dfi.dk/nyheder/filmupdate/2010/velkommen-til-spil...</a>), etc. Events at universities also feel more &quot;open to the public&quot;: if I want to hear a bunch of internationally famous visitors talk about biotech or experimental mathematics, I can go to something like <a href=""http://danstem.ku.dk/events/seminar_series_2014/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danstem.ku.dk/events/seminar_series_2014/</a> or <a href=""http://www.math.ku.dk/english/research/xm/seminar/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.ku.dk/english/research/xm/seminar/</a> respectively. Whereas apart from a handful of advertised public talks, the large amount of stuff undoubtedly happening at Stanford or UC Berkeley didn&#x27;t feel like part of &quot;my&quot; neighborhood, something I&#x27;d hear about or go to as a non-Stanford, non-Berkeley person (or necessarily even be allowed into).<p>There was certainly interesting stuff in SF as well, but it felt less like it was always happening, and more like I had to seek it out and drive anywhere from San Jose to Oakland to get to it, more like a &quot;trip&quot; to an event (like SuperHappyDevHouse, which is great) than a feeling that stuff is always happening all around me. The videogame-dev scene in particular was very scattered, with a good number of studios <i>generally</i> in the area, but that meant anywhere from Marin County to Santa Cruz, so you didn&#x27;t really end up at the same events on a regular basis.",1396141038

That would be a bad newspaper.</i> //<p>Many (most?) newspapers have some stories that are very directly marketing for their advertisers - newspaper runs a story on bra-fittings and so sells advertising space to fashion companies.<p>In fact isn&#x27;t this how newspapers work: they sell advertising. If the stories are &quot;poor&quot; (which characteristic is modified according to the target audience) then the paper doesn&#x27;t sell and the advertiser gets fewer impressions. The paper promotes itself, wins pageviews and sell ads on the number of pageviews it&#x27;s getting. Advertisers get impressions and the system feeds-back allowing the paper to grow, charge more and continue creating &quot;news&quot;.<p>Isn&#x27;t that exactly marketing for the advertisers?<p>Indeed looking at a NYT Magazine story at random I find not only regular advertising but the author&#x27;s byline is also advertising a book. That makes me wonder if they&#x27;re managing to sell much of the story space too.<p>In part I&#x27;d assumed that HN was created in order to provide buzz/feedback for YC companies and serve the purposes of YC (eg market information)?

7494624,comment,7494165,7494165,17,0,mdisraeli,,,"I used to run Stratics&#x27; UO Ideas Den[1], a forum for players to suggest game changes on the semi-official fansite. One of the most popular requests was for just this - for Origin/EA/Mythic to offer official &quot;grey shards&quot;.<p>Grey shards were the name given to player-run servers running re-implementations of Ultima Online, to which the official clients could be hacked to connect to. Some of these got extremely successful, and I&#x27;m fairly sure many of the developers now work in the game industry. Some were simply opportunities to remove changes they didn&#x27;t like (like removing the no-PvP lands). Others were completely new worlds. And some had dedicated teams who ran plot and tried to make the worlds seem alive.<p>Of course, over its years, Ultima Online did go through a number of these changes naturally in one form or another. PvP only servers were launched, and at various times they recruited players to run events and story arcs.<p>But what kept Ultima Online going wasn&#x27;t just the old guard PvPers and the addicts to the original 2D low-res client. There had always been a very strong player community on some shards, with NPC towns used as a basis for player plot and story telling.<p>he tools UO offered were fairly unique as far as this went. You could build your own house, and eventually not only decorate it but design the layout from scratch all by yourself. The player NPC vendor system that allowed people to run shops was clunky, but still very impressive in terms of how creative people got and how many players simply role-played tradespeople and didn&#x27;t really do the whole PvP/PvM thing. <i>You could place objects on the floor, some of which would even block movement</i> - emphasis added for anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried any of the popular MMOs to make clear that this still is a rare feature. The crafting system again was very in depth, too.<p>And then there&#x27;s fishing. A skill that tbh was pretty boring to use, but combine that with trade and you could enjoy yourself out on the oceans in your boat. Treasure hunting was another path you could dedicate your characters to, which included figuring out where in the world a map was showing, and needed skills in lockpicking and dealing with monsters.<p>The skill system was again something we don&#x27;t see a lot of. Mostly this is because it is fairly complex and dull to level up at the same time. Any character could train in any skill, if they had the room to grow or were willing to give up another skill. You could really twink out with complementary fighting skills, be a tradesperson who gathered their own resources, or you could build a completely and utterly useless character, grandmaster at everything that by themselves were useless, and together only had value for roleplay purposes.<p>And we did just that! Ultima Online had a skill called &quot;Begging&quot;, used to get small quantities of money off NPCs. The higher the skill, the slightly more you&#x27;d get. Some of us would roleplay beggars, avoiding all skills that we roleplayed as being &quot;evil&quot;. We would come up with character backstories, and try to earn money off other players by any lawful means that wasn&#x27;t using an &#x27;evil&#x27; skill or against your personal ethics.<p>Speaking of that, the things the rules used to let you do against other players, and the fun you could have in the PvP areas... Originally, when you died your kit stayed on the corpse, and in PvP areas anyone could loot it ;)<p>And if it were not for Ultima Online, we wouldn&#x27;t have the games we now have. Not only was it the first proper MMORPG (or second if you count Meridian 59), but it also inspired many other games. Jagex, one of the UK&#x27;s most successful MMO developers was founded by a team recreating UO in java - the game that became Runescape! That game inspired another open-world java game, Wurm Online, which Notch worked on. Notch, of course, later developed Minecraft, and you might be able to see the similarities ;)<p>Finally, If you&#x27;re into game design theory, one of the original development team of UO is now a key player in that area of academia, having published A Theory Of Fun - <a href=""http://www.raphkoster.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.raphkoster.com/</a>.<p>[1] Old UO player?

If you&#x27;re pushing messages to workers using HTTP or whatever, then you can regulate delivery at the sender, or at a load balancer in between. If you&#x27;re pulling messages via an MQ protocol, you can only do it at the receiver. I&#x27;m not aware of any message broker that lets you throttle messages on a per-consumer basis, much less one that does this automatically based on load or health checks.<p>Deploying a new worker instance? With HTTP, you don&#x27;t add it to the load balancer pool until it&#x27;s ready. With an MQ, you have to tell the app to add itself.<p>Worker failed a health check? With HTTP, you take it out of the load balancer pool. With an MQ, you have to tell it to take itself out of the pool, and hope it can still do that even though it&#x27;s sick.<p>Worker failing to process messages? With HTTP, there&#x27;s a good chance you&#x27;ll notice straight away because it&#x27;s returning 500 errors. With an MQ, you have to hope your monitoring will detect the problem.<p>Workers loaded asymmetrically? With HTTP, the load balancer is in just the right place to, er, balance load (think of Apache mod_jk or mod_cluster). With an MQ, no component of the system has a global overview of load.<p>You can make the workers do the right thing in these scenarios even when using an MQ, but it&#x27;s extra work. It seems to be considerably more involved than doing it with HTTP. Basically, using a message queue pushes a concern which should be external to the worker into it, and that creates work that needs to be done.<p>I am coming to think that whilst it&#x27;s okay for apps to send messages to a queue, they should never receive consume messages from one. Rather, i suspect there should be some small infrastructural component which pulls messages off a queue and sends them to workers with HTTP, via a load balancer. I think this component can follow some simple, generic rules, and leave the smarts in the load balancer as normal. I haven&#x27;t fully fleshed this idea out yet, though.",1396139508

As the article concludes, there are tradeoffs to consider - the broker is a SPOF indeed, but on the other hand it&#x27;ll take care of all the queueing logic (which is not that simple as it seems - acknowledgements, backpressure, redelivery, timeouts etc etc). It&#x27;s also much easier to scale the system out if applications are loosely coupled.<p>Furthermore, a good broker supports some kind of failover. We run a RabbitMQ cluster behind a load balancer, and it works great - once e.g. we had a hardware failure, and the applications did not notice anything from it. Of course we also have to monitor the queues on the broker (one of the few ways to bring down Rabbit is to fill up its disk). But having a central broker for connecting apps also means you have a central point you can keep an eye on to check where your bottlenecks are (which queues build up).<p>Loosely coupled applications are also much more unix-like in the sense that you can make them do one thing instead of baking in your custom restart logic (over a network? please don&#x27;t).",1396139456

If you&#x27;re an <i>employee</i>, income taxes are almost certainly lower in the U.S. than most of the rich countries in Europe. But if you&#x27;re starting a company or working for yourself, it depends a lot more on which U.S. states and/or European countries you&#x27;re considering, and what kind of business you&#x27;re planning to do (sector, number of employees, etc.).<p>Two places Europe can sometimes end up cheaper:<p>1. If you&#x27;re a one-person sole proprietor. American income taxes are relatively high here, and the need to cover your own health insurance, disability insurance, etc. adds some extra expense and paperwork. Here are some numbers I estimated a few months ago for Silicon Valley vs. Copenhagen tax rates: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6192339"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6192339</a><p>2. If corporate income taxes are relevant to your business. There are ways to minimize their impact (especially if you&#x27;re willing to pay for good tax consultants), but the headline rates are generally higher in the U.S. than in Europe, though rates vary widely in Europe so it depends on where you&#x27;re considering in particular. Ireland generally has the lowest rates; in the U.S., NYC has particularly high rates (and some complex rules for registering businesses).<p>3. If you want to do your taxes yourself. American business taxation is nearly impossible to figure out correctly without professional assistance, and there are myriads of pitfalls and penalties.<p>One that varies a lot is &quot;flexibility&quot;. My impression is that the French labor market is rather inflexible, and in general the American one is the most flexible. However on specific issues the American one is somewhat inflexible. There is a particularly big difference between &quot;full-time&quot; and &quot;part-time&quot; employment in the U.S., because the employer is expected to provide &quot;benefits&quot; (at least health insurance, often many other things) to full-time employees. In <i>some</i> of Europe the employer doesn&#x27;t need to worry about these kinds of things at all (which also cuts down on the amount of HR you need to do). In Denmark it&#x27;s relatively common, at least in tech startups, for people to work part-time schedules, e.g. 2 or 3 days a week.",1396139404

For example, I stopped actively participating in StackOverflow. I pine the days when SO was a lot smaller community with high signal to noise ratio, but, more importantly, it had that human feel.<p>These days, it&#x27;s very different. Topic are being parsed and filtered by robotic moderator that cannot possibly let something even remotely option-based slip through. Comment that are relevant, but with subtle jokes are deleted. I remember when Joel and Jeff were actively answering questions to have the critical mass. Now that answers and questions would be closed or moderated. e.g. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/652788/what-is-the-worst-real-world-macros-pre-processor-abuse-youve-ever-come-across"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/652788/what-is-the-worst-...</a>",1396138927

7494571,story,,,2,3,sillysaurus3,"Ask HN:  Glasses that act like a flashbang?",,"I had an idea and was wondering if it was workable from an engineering standpoint.  (It&#x27;s a stupid idea, but that&#x27;s beside the point.  It&#x27;s for fun, and it&#x27;s funny to think about.)<p>The idea is simple: if you&#x27;re in a situation where you&#x27;re being threatened... well, you do what your assailants tell you to do, give them whatever they want from you, then call the police afterwards and try to retrieve your stolen property.<p>(I&#x27;m saying this to be clear that the idea isn&#x27;t serious.)<p>Okay, so, the idea is simple: It&#x27;s a self-defense tool in order to escape a situation where you&#x27;re being threatened.  At night, a sudden flash of bright light is usually enough to disable an attacker for a couple seconds, which is desirable for obvious reasons.  That&#x27;s the whole goal: an extremely bright flash pointed at your attacker&#x27;s eyes.  Like a flashbang, minus the bang.<p>So I was wondering, what&#x27;s the brightest flash that can be emitted from the smallest and lightest electronics?<p>In terms of implementation / form factor, there are a few ways this idea might make (a small amount of) sense.  People sometimes wear headbands while jogging, so the &quot;flasher&quot; could be embedded into that.  Kind of like this, except instead of an MP3 player, it&#x27;s something that emits a big flash: http://i.imgur.com/afoiHxW.png<p>A solution that&#x27;s more likely to be there when you need it is to mount it on top of the lenses of your eyeglasses.  I was thinking that if the electronics are small enough, then it may be possible to make it look like a nondescript strip above the rims of your lenses.  It could be activated by a button on the glasses behind your ear.  (If your hands are up, your ear is pretty close to your hands.)<p>Can modern electronics emit a flash on par with something like a high-end DSLR camera while being small and light enough to wear on your face?",1396138899

Completely legal, even. A bunch of people complained:<p>> Two angry parents went to her principal’s office to express their outrage, and one parent threatened to remove her child from school. The school also received at least a dozen irate phone calls. Twenty to 25 people gathered outside the school to protest because of the statements, and news reporters and camera crews from major news organizations descended upon the school. At the next Home-School Council meeting, the majority of the meeting was devoted to O’Brien’s posts and parents expressed their outrage over the posts. When O’Brien was made aware of the outrage against her posts, she was surprised that her posts had led to such a reaction.<p>Certainly those people disagree that your line exists where you think it does, because they <i>do</i> believe that the teacher&#x27;s private actions certainly are relevant.<p>BTW, this is not bullying.

It can be pretty difficult to figure out what went wrong. Removing the dash will show a (harmless) error message for every .d file generated, which is pretty annoying.<p>2. At one time a.c includes b.h and you run make. a.d is created with &quot;a.o: a.c b.h&quot;. If at this point you add to b.h an include to c.h, the new dependency of a.o on c.h will never be updated in a.d unless you manually delete it. This can cause some pretty nasty bugs!\nThis can be solved by adding<p><pre><code>    -MT $*.o -MT $*.d\n</code></pre>\nto the gcc command line, which causes the dep file to regenerate when one of the dependencies changes (in fact the make manual suggests a similar solution using sed). However this creates another problem: if you remove a header a.h included by a.c (and the #include line to it), a.d still depends on a.h, so make will fail looking for it until you <i>manually delete</i> a.d (and any other dep file depending on the removed header).<p>tl;dr: this solution leaves much to be desired, and can be dangerous in some conditions.",1396137681

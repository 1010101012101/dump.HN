3575049,comment,3571523,3572929,1,0,kyrsey,,,"What makes gold ""real"" value and other exchangeable items not ""real"" value?<p>You had better stick to talking about exchange value, because once you get into nebulous discussion of ""real"" value it becomes immediately relevant that gold is nonproductive at best and prone to fluctuations and bubbles in reality.<p>If you define the discussion of value as being limited to immediate short term exchange, then it's no surprise that you end up concluding that the only things of ""real"" value are whatever gives you liquidity. That is a part of the story, after all Berkshire keeps $20-$30 billion liquid as a matter of policy.<p>But that doesn't tell you anything about future returns or opportunity costs, and it is not the whole story. The idea that gold's value is ""real"" because others think it is real (or better, have long thought that it is real) is just as viciously circular as saying that currency's value is real because others believe it is real.",1328864367

Its treated somewhat like an export, or a border control. (this is why Apple allow you to preclude your app from certain local markets; enter the market, and you ARE bound by its laws for your actions in that market)<p>On the other hand; DPA violation doesn't result in prison, just a (potentially large) fine.<p>On the third hand, its quite possible that Path did not violate the DPA (although its possible they did). The DPA, in short states that you have to gather personal info for a specific, consensual purpose, and not use it for any other, and also store it in a way that protects it from loss/theft/misuse - where misuse includes deciding 6 months down the line to use it for another purpose. It also means that if your 'purpose' for holding that information ceases, you are legally obligated to purge the data - your legal permission to hold ends.<p>So; was there consent - almost certainly not, hence possible DPA violation. But once it was clear they had no broad public consent - they immediately purged the data, so possibly no _deliberate_ violation, and certainly a demonstration of willingness to correct the situation.",1328864276

Gold, too, has exchange value NOT because of its chemical composition - only because people will accept it, and they accept it  because they believe they will be able to trade it in the same way. If it loses half its value due to a bubble popping or the global supply increasing over time, it's no better than a currency which lost half its value due to government policy. There is always something around of value, and if the post-apocalyptic situation is bad enough then gold will be worth only a little at best, if you can even find someone selling whatever you need.<p>Land is an example of something which can produce, as is stock in a company which sells things that are always in demand.

3575021,comment,3571304,3572343,1,0,fingerprinter,,,"This thinking is exactly what Moneyball was all about in Baseball. Football looking at the wrong things.<p>For instance, 225# reps, vertical leap, reach, etc (all NFL combine measurements). Great, you are measuring and ranking, but are you doing anything meaningful? Are you actually looking at the right things? Probably not.<p>If they were, Wes Welker, Tom Brady, Victor Cruz (all in the past superbowl) would have been first round picks, probably top 10. Not undrafted, or late round picks. And JeMarcus Russell and Ryan Leaf wouldn't have been drafted #1 and #2 overall (all the physical tools but not the mental - flame outs).<p>The point is that we as people tend to think we know what to measure and track, but we likely don't. Frankly, we are probably making it up on the fly and we convince ourselves and others that these are good measures, and until someone figures out the next best thing, they actually are. But, as I said, they are probably not the best, or maybe even good, in the infinite wisdom sense.<p>But, think about it this way. Both football and programming have ways we can actually see if someone can do what they say that can do: literally, look at the film. Look at game day film on a player. Look at github or other places for programmers. And, just like with football players, give them REAL scenarios that test their ability to think through a problem, in real time. Do the same with a programmer. Put these two together and you get rid of the people who can't think (Russell and Leaf) and you get rid of the ""physical specimens"" that can't play (Most any Oakland WR drafted under Davis).<p>I personally think this is a much better way that weeds out the most people. Refine your questions and technique and you can spot the people who can and can't perform pretty quickly. If you are unsure, give them a simulated game (programming problem at home) to see what they can do.",1328863517

I want to throw away copyright, I want those musicians that sign up to work with greedy suits--not to cast aspersion on your (former?) line of work which seems to be good-faith and productive--to have to find other ways to express themselves, I want the systems that were _once_ our best effort at promoting artistic expression to die.<p>I want these things dead because after they're dead the absurd but somehow sometimes true accusations of ""selling out"" won't have any weight.<p>I _actually don't care_ that people will lose jobs because copyright is dead.<p>>I think one bad side-effect of the internet is that it has removed people so far from the means of production that they are incapable of appreciating the work that goes into what appears in front of them.<p>I think this is the most insightful sentence of your post.  It attacks the central barrier to removing copyright with a few swift words.<p>Thus I think it important to describe the manner in which I find that it misses the mark.  The Internet is bringing people into contact with the arts of gardening, cooking, woodworking, electronics as never before.<p>Absurdly the disconnect between production of food and appreciation for food has grown _so large_ that food production is looked at as an art--that is, just another mode of human expression!<p>And I couldn't be happier about that.  Appreciation of art is the act of appreciating the work that goes into it.<p>---<p>The problem, of course, is that our economic woes _far_ overshadow our cultural ones.  You speak from the side of ""There is no free lunch,"" and we may well be on a course where that is alarmingly and devastatingly true.

I chose the term ""educator"" over ""teacher"" or ""expert"" for that very reason: namely that neither having a degree in Education nor a PhD in physics makes you a particularly suitable physics educator. KA needs people who can do for biology, neuroscience, history, and so on what Khan can do for college physics and maths.<p>I suspect that they're going to be PhDs and practitioners as opposed to K-12 schoolteachers -- but I really don't give a damn about credentials.

The court found that in this particular case the interference with a person’s right to data protection could not be justified merely by the economic interest of the search engine. At the same time, the Court explicitly clarified that the right to be forgotten is not absolute but will always need to be balanced against other fundamental rights, such as the freedom of expression and of the media (para 85 of the ruling). A case-by-case assessment is needed considering the type of information in question, its sensitivity for the individual’s private life and the interest of the public in having access to that information.

First, they are all, in my experience, willing to talk about it, even eager. Second, every one of them has said basically the same thing: It is a difficult policy but necessary, and beneficial for China overall.<p>Difficult: Most mothers&#x27; experience is related to not having the children they wanted to have. Abortions too. They often look like they are about to cry when they talk about it. It&#x27;s definitely tough, and many are deeply scarred.<p>Beneficial: In an overcrowded country, the up side is obvious. (The mothers I have met are mostly middle or upper class, so it is a biased sample.) They connect the policy with the radical improvements in quality of life.

I think a lot of this boils down to knowing yourself, and that takes time!<p>For example, I&#x27;ve found that I skip around a lot, and I that&#x27;s ok with me because I learn a LOT by doing that. I&#x27;ve found that if I stick to one thing longer than I&#x27;m able to stay interested, it is counterproductive. So I try to mix it. I read, I code, I explore, etc. As long as I feel internally that I&#x27;m making progress, I&#x27;m happy and I continue to love my work and love programming.<p>If anything by doing this I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;m impatient and I want to learn more. I feel like my brain expands when I learn more about programming and I love that feeling.<p>Right now I&#x27;m working on C++ and sometimes I feel discouraged, but then I&#x27;ll switch pace and - for example - write some code rather than read about how incompetent I am, and then I feel empowered and really want to read more.<p>So for me, a lot of it comes down to knowing yourself and working that to your advantage. And right now, I know that my health suffers due to my love for programming + all my other responsibilities. And so I&#x27;ll work on that next.<p>Once again, nice post :)",1405650103

With this in mind, we will begin to reduce the size of our overall workforce by up to 18,000 jobs in the next year. Of that total, our work toward synergies and strategic alignment on Nokia Devices and Services is expected to account for about 12,500 jobs, comprising both professional and factory workers. <i></i>We are moving now to start reducing the first 13,000 positions, and the vast majority of employees whose jobs will be eliminated will be notified over the next six months.<i></i> It&#x27;s important to note that while we are eliminating roles in some areas, we are adding roles in certain other strategic areas. My promise to you is that we will go through this process in the most thoughtful and transparent way possible. We will offer severance to all employees impacted by these changes, as well as job transition help in many locations, and everyone can expect to be treated with the respect they deserve for their contributions to this company.&quot;[1]<p>It makes absolutely no sense.

Especially with publicly traded banks, you have entirely different types of investors with different expectations investing in investment banks vs. commercial banks, and that puts a huge amount of pressure on the commercial side of a merged bank to behave with similar risk profile to its ibank sibling.  When they aren&#x27;t merged there is significantly less pressure to buy higher risk securities.

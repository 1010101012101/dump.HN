The point was that here is 1000 lines of what someone thinks is awkward code to deal with eventual consistency vs 1M lines of code to deal with consistency in another case. If consistency for a particular application can be dealt with in 1000 lines, you should usually go for that instead of for the millions of lines solution.<p>Think of it the other way. They have availability and partition tolerance from Riak and they can handle eventual consistency with 1000 more lines. Now imagine you have MySQL and you have to make run in a multi-master distributed mode, how many lines of code would you need to handle 2 of the CAPs and then haven an application specific way to handle an incomplete (or untimely third part)? I bet it would be more than 1000 lines...",1337054384

Transparent PNGs have been solved long ago. So have the various bugs, but the workarounds needed are much more painful to develop and maintain.<p>Using various libraries to patch in missing functionality only seems to work until you reach real-world complexity with your DOM at which point you will run into any of the countless performance issues with IEs JavaScript implementation which relies on COM marshaling for all of its DOM support, so all these patch-ie-to-add-missing-features-using-JS projects are practically nothing but nice demos.<p>The moment you can at least target IE 8 and you can start to rely on CSS having more ore less the intended effect without stacking hack upon hack, the moment you get to use stuff like display: table, that moment you will see how much you miss by staying in the late 90ies with the code you are writing.",1337051880

3974681,comment,3974191,3974191,22,0,DanBlake,,,"As a new landlord in San Francisco, I can tell you that the biggest issue forcing this is rent control. The way rent control works is certainly designed to help those in need but instead it creates a artificial demand for affordable housing.<p>Without rent control, the market is free to compete and suddenly open up a ton of bottled up apartments. The issue is, a family on welfare with a income of 40k a year should not be living in a 4 bedroom apartment in pacific heights for 1k a month. I have no problem with giving affordable housing to those in need, but rent control is not the answer as it places the burden on individual landlords to provide social security.<p>The biggest gap of people who can live in SF are not the poor (taken care of by rent control) or the rich (dont care/buy homes) but those in between. Run of the road engineers and others who make between 75k and 150k a year. These are the people who are hurt most by san franciscos crazy rent laws.<p>If rent control was abolished, the one thing you would see is that rental rates would lower significantly as supply starts to balance with demand. Yes, some people would be displaced but the question is- If the city of san francisco wants to provide affordable rental units, why dont they instead just pay lower income people directly, letting them be free to choose where to live?",1337051798

This sort of purely extrinsic motivation does not tend to make them very good students (although occasionally I have one that does well and gets an A, good for them).  I'm always a little disappointed in them, because the class is more fun for both of us if they're more internally motivated; sometimes I can manage to get them actually interested, and then they perk up and are happier (and often do better), but sometimes they've just decided that they're not going to like college, and you know what?  I can't force them to.<p>So, I guess they ""win"" that argument.  But, it's an expensive argument to win; and it's kind of a shame, really.<p>As an aside, I also wanted to respond to this line:<p>> <i>Getting an A is as easy as doing everything</i><p>Yes and no.  In my class, and in those of my colleagues who have not overinflated their grades, As are gotten by the students who impress us with their outstanding work.  Part of that is, of course, making sure they do all the pieces (don't skip anything, make sure it all works, check your work, etc), and the smart-but-sloppy students who skip things tend to be my A- and B+ students rather than my A students.  But the students whose primary priority is checking everything off on a checklist, just ""doing everything"", rather than ""getting it"" or ""making a cool thing"" or whatever, almost invariably don't succeed in getting the A.  It sounds like your background meant that you'd already learned a lot of the material independently, so your situation is different, but I think comments like the above are rather misleading for the bulk of students, who are learning this material on their first time around.",1337051690

It was on a holiday, when visiting relatives in Bali (Indonesia), that I came into contact with the Kopi Luwak Industry. I found it fascinating, and even more so after having read a book by  Dr2 Marcone, who won the Nobel Prize in 2006 by using a relatively small investigation to establish the fact that most of the Kopi Luwak for sale is not pure, but a mix-ture. In other words the buyer/consumer of this product is unfairly treated.<p>My goal is to tryFinished and bring back the purity of Kopi Luwak through among others scientific means. Therefore I have contacted the committee which advises the EU on food and nutrition ww.rikilt.wur.n. The TU Delft is partner in this project ww.tu.delft.n. Our combined goal will be to reinstall the value of Kopi Luwak, for it is part of the culture of the Republic of Indonesia. This means that the kopi luwak war amongst the farmers of Indonesia must end and business must see to re-establishing the purity of the product. In this way the value of the Kopi Luwak, as far as the price is concerned, will also increase, so that part of the income could be used to invest - supported by Unicef - in healthcare and education. \nNowadays the management of the Kopi Luwak Industry, as far as the supply chain is concerned, has changed considerably by the integration of high tech equipment with the aim of enhancing the quality of the product.\nFurthermore3 the tackling of unfair business, that is to sell impure Kopi Luwak, may have an impact on the state of mind of the children growing up in the Republic of Indonesia, for then they see that standard business should  be based on fair principles. So when they are grown-ups, they will use the standard of fair trade in their business practices, thus enhancing cultural aspects of their motherland: the Republic of Indonesia.",1337051649

Computer people seem happy to dismiss most of the brain because &quot;neural network—all we need is data!&quot;  But, the brain isn&#x27;t just a bowl of neurons freely connecting to each other.  There&#x27;s a quite rigid structure to brains that give rise to things like the perception of free will and language acquisition (i.e. why no other animals have language).<p>The brain <i>is</i> organized in layers, but the layers don&#x27;t care about respecting order.  layer 5 can be directly connected to layer 0, forwards and backwards, as well as anywhere else in-between.  Brains rely a lot more on inhibiting signals than generating signals.  Plus, depending on how you count, we are made up of three brains put together: left, right, cerebellum, and those are seldom considered in our current fascination with single-task &quot;AI&quot; systems.  You can put a shark fin on your head then swim for a while, but you&#x27;re still not a shark.<p>To go deeper down the rabbit hole, start off with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Cerebellum-Brain-Implicit-Press-Science-ebook/dp/B005DKQQG4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Cerebellum-Brain-Implicit-Press-Scienc...</a> (warning: dense) or skim <a href=""http://neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu/s3/chapter05.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu/s3/chapter05.html</a> or use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Mapping-Mind-Rita-Carter/dp/0520266285"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Mapping-Mind-Rita-Carter/dp/0520266285</a> as an easy getting started reference.<p>As for &quot;neuroscience narrative argues that function and learning cannot be decoupled&quot; — saying <i>learning</i> is a bit of a stretch.  The brain only cares about correlating coincident events (&quot;neurons that fire together wire together&quot;) and wiring together neurons that fire at the same time ends up causing what we see as emergent behaviors (semantic memories bound to episodic memory, operant conditioning, etc).",1441306609

It&#x27;s mostly a matter of calculating the curvature tensor of a wormhole and finding that it is freaky, so the energy-momentum tensor that would satisfy the Einstein equation would need to include negative energy and/or momentum (the Einstein equation basically says curvature tensor = energy tensor(1)). Then exactly how the thing would unravel is a matter of computation, but unravel it would.<p>Or one could presumably find a form of matter that has negative energy density and start building wormholes.<p>1) The energy tensor has energy as the time diagonal value, and momentum as the space diagonal values.",1441306593

Doesn&#x27;t make any sense to the person who views weed as just something to get high with.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily recommend my life. It does lead to addiction after a long time (started at 14 and began smoking everyday in HS then started everyday everyday again at 21 and am currently 27). Everyday, I wake up and get high, work, then get high probably around 5, work, and then eventually go home and get high, and go to sleep. Whatever floats your boat so long as you&#x27;re not hurting anybody, that&#x27;s how I see it.<p>The effects of addiction are pretty confusing to be quite honest with you. I can refrain from smoking all day and then I&#x27;ll hit probably 7PM and be like &quot;I don&#x27;t need to smoke if I don&#x27;t want to,&quot; and actually mean it. The only physical reaction I get to a lack of weed is increased irritability and sometimes a really hot feeling that&#x27;s hard to explain. After a couple days, it&#x27;s more like &quot;I wish I could get high&quot; than it is &quot;I NEED TO GET HIGH!&quot; But it&#x27;s been awhile since I gone a couple days. Even though I been smoking forever (started at 14) and feel like I&#x27;ll never stop smoking, I do feel that I can stop if I really wanted to. I know addicts all say that, but with weed, it just gets to be really easy after like a couple days.<p>It&#x27;s the mental effects of addiction that I actually dislike the most. &quot;It&#x27;s morning, time to get high.&quot; There are times when I think to myself, when did this become normal? Is this normal? People happily guzzle down caffeine in the morning and don&#x27;t say anything, so is what I&#x27;m doing all that bad?<p>It&#x27;s an unusual drug. You can get one strain that gets you all excited and another strain that turns you into Mr. Aristotle and another strain that turns you into Mr. Aristotle caffeinated. I do think it&#x27;s the best hope for mankind though as crazy as that sounds. People become a lot less judgmental and mentally vicious when they start to smoke a lot.

You do understand that Angular 1.x&#x27;s $scope is essentially a virtual DOM inasmuch as it&#x27;s a javascript representation of the DOM which provides a more efficient means of diffing (dirty checking in Angular&#x27;s case). &quot;Virtual DOM&quot; is just a fancy buzzword for React&#x27;s solution to figuring out what to change. React&#x27;s requirement that the entire DOM tree be re-rendered any time any state changes meant that dirty checking would be prohibitively expensive, so they had to come up with a clever workaround which, to their credit, ended up being just as performant as Angular&#x27;s dirty checking.<p>You can use Angular 1.x in exactly the same way you use React by only ever using 1-way binding and constructing your entire application out of directives scoped to elements.

10166755,comment,10163914,10165247,0,0,spangry,,,"&quot;The real problem with land [and property taxes] is the fact it tends to flow into the cost of rent and homeownership.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s simply not true in the case of rent payments to landlords if we&#x27;re talking about a land-value tax (i.e. taxing a proportion of the unimproved value of land). Land-supply is effectively fixed in the short-run (and pretty damn inelastic in the long-run thanks to over-regulation, zoning etc.). Therefore, tenant rents are determined solely by what the demand-side of the market will bear, meaning landlords can&#x27;t pass LVT on (so they bear the economic incidence of the tax). Just to clarify terminology, by land-value tax (LVT), I mean taxing the proportion of unimproved land value that represents capitalisation of future economic rents (unearned profits) from land.<p>It&#x27;s plausible a LVT would actually <i>decrease</i> rents paid by tenants, as it would increase the elasticity of dwelling supply in the long-run (land-owners would have stronger incentives to use land more productively). A properly designed LVT only taxes economic-rents (unearned profits) that currently accrue to private land-owners: if the local council builds a park near some land, the increased amenity for the surrounding area translates to increased economic rents, as the increased amenity is captured in the form of increased unimproved land values.<p>As for home-owners (existing land-owners), theoretically if people are unable to move houses then LVT would increase the cost of home-ownership: directly from increased tax and indirectly from decreased value of their land holding (as future economic rents from land is capitalised into land values). However, this is an unlikely scenario. More likely, the revenue raised from LVT would hopefully be used to cover reductions in property transfer taxes (i.e. ad valorem/stamp-duty taxes), which have absurd efficiency costs. This would reduce the cost of home-ownership overall.<p>People would pay less transfer tax over their lifetime, and property and land prices would fall due to increased allocative efficiency: reduced transaction taxes mean more efficient allocation of existing  housing and land stock, as the tax disincentive to reallocate is reduced or eliminated. Also, under an LVT existing land would also be used more efficiently (e.g. medium-high density inner-city dwellings) as there would be higher opportunity costs of using high-value land unproductively (e.g. building a 1 bedroom shack on a big plot of land in the CBD).<p>In my opinion, the real problem is that these dynamics aren&#x27;t immediately evident, are difficult to explain, and it&#x27;s very easy to (mistakenly) conflate legal incidence with economic incidence of taxation. It&#x27;s interesting you bring up gasoline taxes as this is the classic example: the Carter administration attempted to increase gas tax and hand the revenue back out through tax-cuts. It didn&#x27;t happen because many thought it was simply taking with one hand and giving with the other.<p>In actual fact, given the aim was to reduce US oil consumption, it was pretty sound policy. Even though people would have ended up with the same amount of money (neutral income effect), gasoline consumption would have been reduced due to substitution effects: gas would have become relatively more expensive in comparison to every other consumption possibility, meaning people would substitute away.",1441305543

I had no experience with drugs of any kind besides alcohol either, and I quickly became fascinated with the effects it had on my brain. Picking it up with the same intensity I would pick up any other interest, I read a lot of stuff about the subject (Timothy Leary, Sam Harris, Aldous Huxley, etc.) and tried a few other psychedelics.<p>Then for a couple years I had a job that made me utterly miserable, and I smoked as soon as I got home every night. I don&#x27;t believe it strongly affected my intellectual performance (a lot of my highly upvoted HN comments from that time were written while high), but it made me okay with not doing nothing productive, merely aimlessly consuming media (this is summed up really well in a South Park episode, where Randy tells his son Stan: <i>&quot;Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn&#x27;t gonna make you kill people, and it most likely isn&#x27;t gonna fund terrorism, but, well son, pot makes you feel fine with being bored, and it&#x27;s when you&#x27;re bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren&#x27;t good at anything.&quot;</i>).<p>Now I have a job that I really like and am in a generally better place in life, and smoke maybe once a week or so. My personality tends to be fairly inwards-oriented, and I get anxious fairly easily (like many hackers, I presume), and weed helps me step back, and get perspective on my mental state. It&#x27;s also a good social bonding agent, and also an interesting substance to use when you&#x27;ve been working on a creative problem for a while and are stuck (my experience has been that it&#x27;s harder for my brain to learn completely new things while high, but easier to make connections between things I already know, or see known things under a new light).",1441304627

Assuming you have insurance for catastrophic events, few things should be able to wipe out hundreds of thousands in savings, which is what you&#x27;d quickly build up with a high savings rate, especially in a high-paying field.<p>Health insurance never provided 100% coverage and you can get into 5 figures with health insurance. I&#x27;m not sure why you disbelieve it given its a pretty accepted fact when talking about medical bankruptcies with insurance.<p>Similarly, if you are having a major medical event, if you cannot work for months...failure to earn income is a cost.<p>Other major negative events are extended bouts of unemployment that will chew through savings while creating a failure to earn income for months, etc.<p>Hell, even being sued can be a problem if you have a high networth because you have access to resources. In the past 12 months, I&#x27;ve literally had people track me down to drag me into such fights over money.<p>> And even if one of your desired safety margins is a pile of savings, the higher your savings rate the sooner you build up those buffers. If you assume one of those events will happen and wipe out a pile of savings, that&#x27;s an added drain that you&#x27;d have to account for, but a high savings rate still means you&#x27;ll retire sooner than you would have with a lower savings rate.<p>I&#x27;m saying he is selling you a dream that you can do it at the age you stated.

I&#x27;ve certainly never done it.<p>e.g.:<p><pre><code>  # yes!\n  git push origin my-feature-branch\n  git push origin master\n\n  # no!\n  git push --force origin master\n</code></pre>\nnsfyn55 makes a good point about protection from others, though. Maintaining my own fork, and using pull requests to the central repo, seems to help avoid others clobbering master, but that seems to be more of a reflection of my organization&#x27;s Git workflow.<p>If your team treats Git the way we used to use Mercurial, where each developer will merge their changes into master and then push it, you&#x27;re going to be in a WORLD of hurt.  (It&#x27;s likely we were doing it wrong there, too. I didn&#x27;t really grok distributed source control until we moved to Git.)<p>If you use the Github Flow [0], the merging is done in the UI of your Github (or Gitlab/etc) instance, rather than directly with `git`.  (I believe Atlassian&#x27;s stash has a similar but slightly different recommended workflow.)  The keys for us are:<p><pre><code>  - One team repo is the &quot;official&quot; repo. (e.g., UI/foo-widget)\n  - Each dev forks the repo, and pushes their branches on that fork \n    (e.g. gknoy/foo-widget:gk-feature)\n  - Pull Requests are made from the dev&#x27;s repo __to the official one__ \n    (e.g. from gknoy/foo-widget&#x27;s gk-feature branch \n          to UI/foo-widget&#x27;s master branch)\n</code></pre>\nSome teams instead opt to have each dev make branches on the same (official) repo.  I prefer the extra safety net of maintaining my own fork.  If I were to mistakenly commit something (or merge something, or rebase something) incorrectly, and totally fubar my repo&#x27;s master branch, and then push that up to my origin before noticing it, I can recover it easily (rename branches, checkout the commit that should be the head, re-push).    Worst case, I can delete my fork and re-fork it. ;)  If I were to do that on a repo that I have shared access to, I&#x27;d have much more anxiety.<p>Incidentally, I&#x27;ve made exactly that mistake (merged or committed something onto my local master, and then pushed it to my origin) TWICE, and caught when others have when doing code reviews.  The first time, I panicked and deleted/re-created my forked repo.  The second time, I fixed it by juggling branches, and it was substantially easier.  (Slower: it took me ~20 minutes I think?)  In neither case did my mistakes affect anyone else, though, since the repo I messed up was my own.)<p>This is, of course, based heavily on Github&#x27;s suggested practices, since we use Github Enterprise at work.  Were I using Stash or GitLab, there would likely be some changes, but I think the team workflow really benefits when you dive all-in on Git&#x27;s distributed nature.<p>0: <a href=""https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/</a>",1441303541

He was quite happy with the flexibility, that he could work Uber when he was between gigs. &quot;Just turn on my app, start making money, turn it off when I&#x27;m done&quot;. No hours, no expectations. And he used to drive cabs; never again, he said.<p>Another data point: my barber (who I&#x27;ve known for 5+ years) told me that he&#x27;s started driving Uber on the side. Before the shop opens, and if he has no appointments in the morning, he just starts giving rides. He also was very happy about the flexibility. It&#x27;s a way to supplement his income.<p>I have yet to meet an Uber driver who feels &quot;exploited&quot; or taken advantage of.

251565,comment,251141,251519,0,0,DaniFong,,,"I disagree pretty strongly here. The data point I want to pick out are the existence of trolls: people who end up destroying enlightened discussion and replacing it with a bigot firefight.<p>There are many ways to reduce freedom of speech. One can be coerced, or one can be denied access to the time required to think of and say something useful. But there's another kind of denial -- when a conversation turns ugly, many types of speech simply disappear. /b/tards actively inhibit other types of conversation. So freedom of speech can't be axiomatic: it is internally inconsistent.<p>When the founding fathers penned the bill of rights, speech meant speech [edit: though, as pg has pointed out, they intended to include the printed word in their discussion.]. Not intrusive speech, and not published, internationally accessible works. They were not so clairvoyant as to see how powerful small publishing houses and studios could become.<p>One important type of freedom of speech I disagree with is that which impinges on someone else's freedom of speech. Everyone should have a place for their voice, but I am unwilling to protect any right to intrude.",1216580120

251562,comment,250931,251008,0,0,dan-kruchinin,,,"Agree. Wikipedia's ""philosophy"" implies neutrality of each article. If someone finds in article some kind of propaganda or any facts that seem to be false, he can easily remove/change doubtful data after checking its origins.
But on the other hand when you read some article on wikipedia, you just haven't enough time to verify each origin or even to think about the truth of the article.",1216579975

better knowledge/use strong passwords? nope don't think so
better admin? maybe
better product? absolutely ... ssh, encription, randomization (swap, memory, etc)<p>my conclusion: unix is more secure due to its bottom-up iterate-often development model yielding better product (more secure, more powerful, etc)",1216579584

AWS still needs to be managed, you still need sysadmins available 24/7 so you won't save any money there. the only thing AWS has going for it is provisioning. be smart and take advantage of that (eg. have your own physical infrastructure and be able to send some of the load the way of AWS if and when you need to).",1216577643

The ability to throw raw power at a problem is not a competitive advantage.<p>As an aside, I wish CS was taught like that. ""You are never going to need to write your own sort ever, but we are going to teach you about sorting so you understand that smart algorithms always beat brute force. Pay attention.""<p>My personal opinion of Java is that its shortcomings were either necessary for or worth putting up with for a world of applications on demand running on heterogenous client devices (i.e. the original applet vision). Now that it's mainly used in known environments (i.e. your own servers) it has to compete on its merits alone, and that's where it struggles.

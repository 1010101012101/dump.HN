The trend though I think is that computing has gotten huge but actually developing that computing hasn&#x27;t grown at all in the youth group, just the consumption of that computing. You lose a lot of tinker-ability when you move to GUIs and especially when you don&#x27;t distribute developer tools or learning resources.<p>I mean, think of the generation growing on iphones.

Nginx brought his uwsgi friend and they took turns running the site, nginx serving images and scripts, uwsgi replacing mod_wsgi.<p>This is what a competitive space looks like. Apache has competing modules, there are http servers and wsgi servers, some of them embedded, some of them external, http servers can collaborate or replace each other when a better thing comes along.<p>You don&#x27;t see an http server deciding it will be the sole http server on the system, swallowing a wsgi server and waging war to all others.",1374353825

They started their computing experiences <i>on</i> GUIs in Windows 95. I started on dos at around 2 - 3, and I know my personal interest in computing was heavily developed by the need to use a dos terminal for a few years. I know my younger brother, his peers, and pretty much everyone else I grew up with (not many 2 - 3 year olds played on a computer, but I liked playing Wolfenstein at that age) don&#x27;t know what a terminal is, what code looks like, how to do terminal piping or navigate with terminal commands. Because they never saw it.<p>I&#x27;m also not arguing there aren&#x27;t exceptions, but my older cousin grew up on the c64 and spent ages 5 - 10 basically hacking on that thing. Tremendous growth experience in his eventual CS education. It went from upper middle class families owning a tinker box for their 5 - 15 year olds to upper middle class families signing kids up for facebook and cell phones before they hit 10.<p>> Being online and having so easy access to so much information, entertainment, communication etc has generally made people more impatient and less willing to really commit to the kind of single minded focus that is needed to get into and really develop programming knowledge.<p>I think they are easily distracted. I know I was, I went from scripting nwscript persistent worlds at 12 in NwN to playing wow all the time. I learned some lua there, and tweaked some addons, but I was effectively stuck on my programming experience from 13 - 18, though that was mostly because MMOs were a great escapism from horrible public education settings, and I liked turning my brain off at the time since I never really had a reason to turn it on.<p>But as soon as I hit my senior year of high school I got my act in gear, mostly because I was tech-savvy from my earliest affiliations with computers, and against what Microsoft wanted me to do with my devices (hacking them). I set up dual boot Ubuntu, learned Python / Java, got my BS, and I&#x27;ve only gone down the rabbit hole since then. I&#x27;ve been soldering recently, run Arch, use terminals all the time, I recently did a cmos reset over 3.3v current on a router.<p>But that required a spark that only really came from my most developmental years having to interact with computers as tinker boxes rather than colorful graphical click squares, and few of my peers got that experience.",1374353744

I&#x27;m just saying there&#x27;s a big difference between testing/learning/prototyping and releasing something that is claimed to be secure. Otherwise you end up with Cryptocat[1].<p>> Even with that possibility though, I still think using browser-based crypto creates a more secure environment than the server storing unencrypted files.<p>If you&#x27;re using any JS then you have to completely trust the server that is serving it. At any point the server could replace &quot;good.js&quot; with &quot;bad.js&quot; and the browser will happily execute it. Any encryption you perform on the client side would be moot as &quot;bad.js&quot; could do whatever it wants with your plaintext and your encryption keys.<p>> If the data is unencrypted, an attacker that manages to own the server has access to everyone&#x27;s data. With it encrypted, the attacker will only get data from users who are using the site while it&#x27;s owned.<p>Again you&#x27;re trusting the server to not save your encryption keys though by serving you &quot;good.js&quot; and not &quot;bad.js&quot;! All roads lead back to you trusting the server to play nice.<p>Unless you use untrusted remote services as opaque object stores and handle all encryption via secure code on the client side with proper signatures to prevent remote tampering[2], you&#x27;re trusting the server not to compromise you.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocat#Security_concerns"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocat#Security_concerns</a><p>[2]: Tarsnap (<a href=""https://www.tarsnap.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.tarsnap.com/</a>) is a perfect example of a client not trusting the server. The tarsnap service stores it&#x27;s data on S3 but first all data is encrypted client side on your own machine.

6076421,comment,6076066,6076329,1,0,FooBarWidget,,,"Alright, point taken. Then systemd is not for you. However I want to argue that not all software <i>should</i> cater to everybody. While modularity (which in this discussion is apparently defined as &quot;the ability to disable or swap components&quot;) is often seen as a good thing, there are quite a lot of downsides as well:<p>- Certain guarantees and consistencies disappear. Instead of having a system that you know you can rely on, it suddenly becomes entirely dependent on the configuration options. While it sounds nice if any part can be enabled, disabled, moved or swapped, then the system&#x27;s predictability goes down. Furthermore, some combinations may be incompatible because abstractions are inherently leaky. Good luck finding out whether you&#x27;re suffering from a compatibility problem or not. You can compare this to the many complaints about Android fragmentation. Because everybody can customize Android, writing an app that works on all Android devices becomes extremely difficult.<p>- Installation complexity goes way up. It&#x27;s much easier to install a system if it states &quot;I need this, this and this&quot;, instead of &quot;I can use this, or this, or this, if it&#x27;s configured in X, Y and Z way&quot;.<p>- Certain features cannot be implemented in a simple manner because you have to cater to the lowest common denominator. XFree86 was like that. Because it had to be portable, it cannot assume any kernel capabilities. And as a result XFree86 came with its own mode setting code, its own ELF binary loader, had to run as root, etc etc.",1374351744

6076363,comment,6075912,6075912,2,0,greatzebu,,,"I usually enjoy math problems that are motivated by some interesting real scenario like a man evading a lion, but in this case I don&#x27;t think it works very well. You end up concluding that the man can evade the lion, but the solution only works if the man and the lion have zero volume and you don&#x27;t mind getting arbitrarily close to the lion. So the math ends up being very much at odds with the physical scenario that&#x27;s ostensibly motivating it. And this solution doesn&#x27;t say anything about the possible existence of a solution that maintains a finite distance between the man and the lion, so you&#x27;re left wondering whether or not a real solution might still exist. Still a neat technique, but the motivating scenario doesn&#x27;t work for me.",1374350928

The MPAA informs the court that isoHunt has deliberately engineered the filter to ensure that it is ineffective and wants the site to turn over its source code to prove their claims. In addition, the MPAA wants millions of dollars in compensation for the damages the studios have suffered through the isoHunt site.<p>isohuntAlmost three years ago the U.S. District Court of California ordered BitTorrent search engine isoHunt to start filtering its search results.<p>The injunction was the result of isoHunts protracted court battle with the MPAA that began back in 2006. The Court ordered the owner of isoHunt to censor the sites search engine based on a list of thousands of keywords provided by the MPAA, or cease its operations entirely in the U.S.<p>isoHunt implemented the filter for U.S. visitors which allowed it to remain online, but at the same time owner Gary Fung took his case to the Court of Appeals. Through the appeal, isoHunt hoped to reverse the permanent injunction, but this didnt come to pass.<p>With the appeal concluded the movie studios are now asking for a summary judgment, hoping that the court awards them compensation for the many pirated movies that were downloaded via the isoHunt site. In addition, the MPAA has filed a motion for contempt claiming that the current keyword filter on the isoHunt Lite site is not doing its job.<p>The Isohunt Lite filtering problems are too serious and consistent to be mere matters of innocent mistake or unavoidable filtering leakage as Defendants have variously claimed, the MPAA tells the court, suggesting that isoHunt is making these mistakes intentionally to keep up its profits.<p>The record to date supports the inference that Defendants have deliberately engineered the filter to ensure that it is ineffective in preventing access to Plaintiffs copyrighted works. As the Court found, because Defendants profit from infringement, they have a powerful economic incentive to continue providing users with access to Plaintiffs popular movies and television programs.<p>Backed up by screenshots, the MPAA cites several examples of popular movies whose titles are on the ban list, but are still available thought the site.<p>One work on Plaintiffs title list is the popular film Zero Dark Thirty for which Plaintiffs provided Defendants the movie title, release date and media type. Yet, the movie is available to any Isohunt Lite user who looks for it. Typing the term Zero Dark Thirty into Isohunt Lites search box returns innumerable dot torrent files for the movie.\nMPAAs screenshot of isoHunt<p>zerodark<p>The movie studios argue that nearly all movies are still accessible through the site, which would mean that isoHunt is not in compliance with the injunction. While isoHunt has claimed that these are mere mistakes, the MPAA believes that it supports their motion for contempt.<p>These are not isolated instances. Virtually every movie Plaintiffs looked for using Isohunt Lite returned innumerable dot torrent files for Plaintiffs copyrighted works. Defendants so-called filter does not even appear to block access to dot torrent files that match a movies exact title, MPAA writes.<p>Facially, such a filter is wholly ineffective and cannot be the basis of compliance with an injunction that enjoins Defendants from hosting, indexing, linking to, or otherwise providing access to any Dot-torrent or similar files that correspond, point or lead to any of the Copyrighted Works.<p>The MPAA asks the court to order isoHunt to hand over all filter-related source code and databases, so the movie studios can show that the filtering failures are not innocent mistakes or mere unavoidable leakage.<p>TorrentFreak asked isoHunt owner Gary Fung for a comment on the allegations put forward by the MPAA, but he chose not to respond at this time.<p>It is clear that the MPAA is not letting the isoHunt case rest just yet. In addition to the motion for contempt there is also a motion for summary judgment pending. The movie studios are currently in the process of calculating the damages they have suffered as a result of isoHunts operations, which is expected to be in the millions.<p>The MPAA previously won a $110 million judgment against the TorrentSpy site, and its expected the damages claimed against isoHunt will be in the same range, or perhaps even higher.",1374350502

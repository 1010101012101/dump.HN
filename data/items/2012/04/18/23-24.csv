Bernd Brgmann - This introduced the basic idea.<p>Monte-Carlo Go Developments. Bruno Bouzy - Bouzy is the guy that kept hammering at the original Brgmann idea while everyone else thought it was a dead end.<p>Efficient Selectivity and Backup Operators in Monte-Carlo Tree Search. Remi Coulom - This was really <i>the</i> breakthrough paper, that showed how to combine Monte Carlo simulations with a tree search. Was also the first MC bot to win the gold medals.<p>Mogo replaced the ad-hock operators in the last paper with an algorithm with more mathematical grounding (UCT). Even though the name is now very well known, most top Go programs, including the last research published about Mogo, actually already dropped the idea and went back to more ad-hock formulas again.<p>The article also makes the common mistake that the position is evaluated using random games. Calling them random is quite misleading. It seems to be necessary to include some knowledge in them, but too much knowledge hurts the strength again - regardless of any speed impact. It's an open problem to fundamentally understand exactly what kind of knowledge helps the program to actually play stronger.<p>What happened in Go is also a nice illustration that if you want to make a computer good at an AI task, the key is finding an algorithm that approximately-linearly improves with the computing power you throw at it.

Chess feels more like a set of arbitrary pieces of knowledge""</i><p>That is exactly the reason that I think go (1) may be solved before chess is solved.<p>For go, there are some results that give hope that an all encompassing theory exists. For chess, the best we have are results of exhaustive searches of relatively simple situations and a bunch of heuristics. It is true that, together, those have led to spectacular results, but I do not think they will lead to a proof about who wins chess.<p>(1) to be exact: Mathematical go, as defined in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Go-Chilling-Gets-Point/dp/1568810326"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Go-Chilling-Gets-Point/dp...</a>. ko rules can have variations, and there are variations in how to count points at the end of a game. Both may affect only a tiny fraction of games, but a alpha-beta search may need only one path that is a win under ruleset A and a loss under ruleset B to change the outcome of a game.",1334790884

Of course that could be because I am much stronger in chess and go overwhelms me a bit.\nI like go more in general, it has aesthetic appeal which I like. The only drawback is that even blitz games are quite long while in chess you can fire up few 1 0 (1minute per game no increment) on internet in no-time :)",1334790689

As the CTO and co-founder I owned almost half of the company and our lawyer made a mistake of using a clawback clause instead of a typical 4yr vesting schedule with a 1yr cliff. So upon leaving, I will still own a small amount of the company, roughly 10%. We initially raised around $25k and also purchased a laptop for me with some of the company funds.<p>I'll be leaving the company at the end of the month to become a co-founder in another company with much more traction. The new company has a similar business model (subscription based) but in a completely different market, hence no competition. So my code may possibly be similar in some ways, or not. Ultimately, I want to make sure that we don't get screwed in the future by my old-cofounder if the new company becomes successful and they say they still own the IP on something.<p>The dilemma: Old co-founder wants my shares back. They want to me to keep my laptop (worth ~$1500) in return for the shares, but I know the laptop is considered IP of the company (unless there is a way to say it isn't). I'm not sure I should even trade the shares for any amount since that company could possibly be worth something in the future and I built everything from design and dev. On the other hand, I don't want any legal issues in the future if I were to keep my shares. Any advice would be helpful, thanks!",1334790051

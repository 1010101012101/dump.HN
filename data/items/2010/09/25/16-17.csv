The world, which is China.\nAnd then, I've moved to Europe in the early 90s. I've discovered something new: my dad's mac. First, I was only playing Go and dark castle on it but then, I've started asking myself how to make my own games.\nMy parents are all engineers and they told me a lil' about Dos, FreeBSD but also Linux.\nI've received my first PC at 11 and the first thing I did is playing Fallout. The second thing I did is using a hex-editor to crack the save to get the best weapons :p\nAnd I've also received Internet at home! Life changing! I've actually met people ""like me"". Very smart people indeed. And I've learnt much more on the web than at school and I felt I was apart of another world. IRC was more real than IRL.\nAnd thanks to the Internet, I've read a lot of tutorials and ABCs so I started writing my first lines in C/C+ and ASM at 12 and never stopped... well, I've actually stopped.\nOne day, at 21, I discovered I wanted to do something else. I mean, I still like technology in general but I've actually stopped reading hackers blogs, cookbooks and I stopped trying every crackme challenge over the web.\nI was fed up with all of these things. I felt I was just a rebellious kid trying to prove to himself how smart he was. \nSo I stopped.\nAnd so I've asked myself exactly this question same question: what now?<p>Well, ""now"", after 3-4 years, I'm doing a business degree. I've also met the girl I love. I've also played in a French TV series. Oh, yeah, I've also been all around the world. Actually, I did many things. Much more than expected. I thought, when I stopped living before my PC, that I'd maybe find a new ""hobby"" and just farm it like I've farmed C/C+. Nop, nothing about farming just ""one"" thing but doing, sometimes casually, many, many different things.<p>But guess what? I've started a Web-startup (elive.pro)! \nJust like that.\nBecause I can. And because I still like technology. And because if I was fed up with the hackers' environment 4 years ago, now, it's pretty different for me: I don't know much about the so-called Web 2.0 and I want to learn, to do something. And meet new people. Smart people.<p>You know what? It's all about love. Technology is for many of us, our first and our real love.\nYou will rekindle the flame. But sometimes, even if you really love something or someone, you have to let it or her/him alone.<p>So, let the technology stuffs alone. Try new things and one day, you'll automatically come back to your first love.\nMaybe not as a developer but definitely come back somehow.",1285433657

1727278,comment,1726764,1727064,0,0,shadowsun7,,,"No it's not. Good design in social software is about what best serves the group, not the individual. (read Clay Shirky's seminal work on the issue, if you don't believe me <a href=""http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html</a>). Now I want you to consider a couple of issues:<p>1) You give the user the ability to disagree by vote. What you're doing is that you're giving people the ability to click a button instead of writing a counter-argument. How does that add to the discourse? This doesn't benefit a group now, does it?<p>2) You have two voting metrics. How would the ranking algorithm work? Why is populist agreement important to how the comments are arranged? Does that not make groupthink more prominent, not less? If so, why clutter the interface?<p>3) Is there anything wrong with a fuzzy definition of how voting is used? Sure, people have been downvoted before because other people disagreed with them, but by and large this is a rare occurrence. Oftentimes comments are downvoted and then upvoted again, when more readers stumble across the comment and think: 'say, this isn't right, this shouldn't be downvoted even though I don't agree with it'. It's happened to me before.<p>Why does this happen sometimes, and not other times? I have a theory about that: good comments run the risk of being downvoted when a) they disagree with the prevailing groupthink on HN ... AND b) they are badly written. (<i>badly</i> here is defined as: unclear, or disorganized, or just plain bad). You rarely run the risk of being unfairly downvoted if you take the time to write your comment, and write it well. My experience at HN seems to support this, I'm not sure if the theory would hold true all the time, but I suspect that it does work, most of the time.<p>I think ambiguity about how comments are used is okay, and there really isn't anything terrible or wrong with the current system. At least, nothing to justify the addition of another metric.",1285432603

1727276,comment,1726947,1727122,0,0,lrm242,,,"The concluding question from the article is fundamentally flawed and completely invalid.<p>The market functions because people who want to buy are matched with people who want to sell. This fundamental concepts requires there be an asynchrony in market participant motivations. Leaning the market to one type of participant (let's say, long term value investors) will disincent others to participate. By doing this, the market will find it harder and harder to serve those it deems most important because no one will take the other side of their trades.<p>People seem to think that markets are there to serve them. In reality, markets are there to serve two people at once. The unique pairing of a buyer and seller is required for the market to function and by definition requires the market to cater to no one. It simply must provide a service that is deemed fair by all participants. Fair to the point that they are not disincented to participate.<p>From the article, if the mutual funds actually stand up and say, ""You know what, I'm not trading Tape C securities anymore, especially not on BATS or Nasdaq. I will now only trade Tape A, NYSE listed, specialist controlled stocks"" you can bet that the other exchangse will listen and do what's required to maintain their order flow. Of course, the mutual fund managers WON'T do this precisely because they know whatever disincentive they are faced with by participating in venues where automated trading is prevelant are far outweighed by the benefits they receive by trading there.<p>This is nothing more than a group of people wanting the good old days back. Times change, to keep up you must adapt. Those mutual funds need to invest in better execution. They need to learn to play in the new world and stop trying to introduce misleading rules into the system to fix the game like it's 1993.

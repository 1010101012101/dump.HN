8410910,comment,8409823,8410716,1,0,graycat,,,"> I&#x27;d argue that learning about the scope of history\nrather than just post-1800 is valuable.<p>So would I. But much more is known about the years\nsince 1800 than before year 1000, yet my\nmost serious history courses spent so much time\nbefore year 0 they never made it to 1800 although\nthey were supposed to.<p>Moreover, drawing from a Markov assumption, which\ncommonly does hold over time, for understanding\n1900, what the situation was in 1800 is important,\nbut, given what that situation was in 1800, what the\nsituation was, in addition, in year 1000 or 1000 BC\nis next to irrelevant.<p>Of course, what we really need to care about from\nhistory is what it can tell us about now and 10, 50,\n100 years from now.  For that, sure, can even just\nstart in 1800 and lose very little from ignoring\n1000 BC.  Still, sure, I&#x27;d go along with a fast pass\nto year 1000, a little slower to year 1800, and then\ndig in.<p>The academic study of history seems to be more an\ninfatuation with the past than a source of lessons\nfor the future, or from just a movie, &quot;a passion for\nantiquities.&quot;<p>> That said, you seem to lay the blame for all that\non having to take what I assume was more or less an\nEnglish literature class throughout that period\n(though I doubt it was such in 1st grade).<p>No, I was careful not to say &quot;class&quot; or &quot;course&quot;.\nThey taught <i>English</i> in grades 1-6, and there the\nreading was essentially all just fictional\nliterature, and the writing assignments were all\nessentially just versions of story telling, but the\nactual separate courses in <i>English</i> didn&#x27;t start\nuntil grade 7.<p>> But I personally think there&#x27;s a lot of value in\nappreciating great literature (as well as other\nfiction).<p>If that stuff is to be required, then the claims and\nsupport for them should be made clear.<p>For <i>appreciation</i>, I&#x27;m a big fan of classical\nmusic.  E.g., last night it was the von Karajan\nrecording of the R. Strauss <i>Ein Heldenleben</i>.  To\nme, passionate stuff.  Highly <i>meaningful</i>.  Still,\nvery few people will get much out of that music.\nBut, I do <i>appreciate</i> it, but just how and why are\nlong stories.  Net, I couldn&#x27;t recommend that a\nmusic appreciation class with such music be\nrequired.<p>Similarly for a class in <i>appreciation</i> of\n<i>great literature</i>.  STEM subjects?  Sure.<p>> I&#x27;m sorry you apparently prefer to only read\nprogramming books.<p>Take a pass through either of, say, Jacques Neveu,\n<i>Mathematical Foundations of the Calculus of\nProbability</i> or David G.  Luenberger, <i>Optimization\nby Vector Space Methods</i> I listed, which I have\ndone, especially the first, and still claim that\nthese are &quot;programming books&quot;.  Both have as\nprerequisites a solid undergraduate pure math\nbackground; the first is heavily about measure\ntheory, especially the Radon-Nikodym theorem; both\nare heavily about functional analysis, e.g., Hilbert\nand Banach spaces; and the second is heavily about\nthe Hahn-Banach theorem.<p>I take it that you like fictional literature.  Well,\nI don&#x27;t.  And, whether I like it or not, since there\nis no common and very good case for the value other\nthan just entertainment, I suggest that less of it\nbe force fed.",1412463234

Apple has semi-convincingly denied the presence of a few, very specific attack vectors, and the article is speculating about the details of those denials, which is all well and good.<p>But it is an absolute certainty that communications technologies built and operated by major American industry are wholly compromised. To believe otherwise is to grossly misunderestimate the nature of State intelligence actors. The historical record is clear that big telecom + hardware providers have always been in bed with State power, both in America and elsewhere, and the Snowden docs pretty clearly show that&#x27;s still true today.<p>Maybe Apple&#x27;s announcement means that the county sheriff can&#x27;t read your teenage son&#x27;s weed-dealing text messages. But if bin Laden had an iPhone, the men in the windowless buildings would beyond a shadow of a doubt be reading his communications, probably via seven or eight independent attack vectors (not counting the compromised publicly switched telephone network, over-the-air signals, etc.)<p>If you have secrets, keep them off of communication technologies run by large companies.

It&#x27;s understood as an intuitive concept, but sentience, consciousness and similar terms have defied solid definition for centuries.

When you work with shallow nets trained with regular backprop + dropout, you see that their learning capabilities tend to &quot;saturate&quot; much quicker than deep nets. Often with shallow nets, after a point you don&#x27;t get better results by adding more units or more training data. But deep nets are better able to make use of these extra parameters (extra layers) and extra training data.<p>Possibly because deep nets conceptually &quot;break down&quot; a learning problem into incremental steps (each new layer being a higher level of representation).<p>But then again, maybe the problem is simply that we don&#x27;t have sufficiently good methods for training shallow NNs on large-scale problems.

Humans are superbly evolved to eat a little bit of just about everything, and terribly evolved to eat a lot of one kind of thing for a long time. There are millions of years of evolution built into us and inherited from our ancestors that determined that a modern <i>homo sapien</i> is destined to require some animal products in their consumption inventory. Meat was important enough that if we had an herbivorous ancestor, that ancestor is unknown in the fossil record. We purposely spent so much time finding animal sources, despite plentiful plant life nearly everywhere, that we even evolved brains, tools and fire and actually evolved away in-situ nutritional synthesis of various critical nutrients (that all other herbivores enjoy) all almost purely to take on the higher risk task of eating other animals. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7763330"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7763330</a><p>In <i>theory</i> it <i>might</i> be possible to craft a healthy, sustainable, long-term diet that uses no animals whatsoever, and would last generations with no ill effects on population health.<p>However, there&#x27;s overwhelming evidence that, in practice, the kind of diet around 90% of practicing vegans practice is not that diet. In numerous serious studies, 70-90% of all tested practicing vegans test as B12 deficient, which is not a sustainable long term dietary deficiency over generations. Theoretically, after just a few generations of this kind of deficiency, if anybody is alive at all, they&#x27;ll suffer from severe congenital neurological deficiencies that would make sustaining a modern society impossible. B12 sufficiency would be a non-optional part of any non-animal diet, and it appears that practicing vegans are not able to construct an alternative herbivorous diet that provides even single-generational sufficiency.<p>Other typical deficiencies found in large vegan population studies suggest that humans are generally poorly adapted to long-term, sustained, plant-only diets: with neurological and cardiovascular issues presenting as long-term consequences of the diet.<p>There&#x27;s other challenges, some nutrients are pitifully rare or not as bioavailable to humans from plant sources as from animal ones: B12, DHA (and some important varieties of O3FAs, Vitamin A compounds, Arginine, Creatine, Carnosine, Vitamin D, Heme, and the list goes on.<p>There&#x27;s other issues to, as the nutritional balance of vegan diets isn&#x27;t what we&#x27;re evolved to process, humans suffer from various absorption issues as plant sources provide high quantities of some food components that prevents absorption of some critical minerals: e.g. phytates block zinc for example.<p>One of the significant challenge for Vegans is the incredible amount of &quot;sciency-sounding&quot;, but completely wrong nutritional advocacy advice available in the vegan community. The science is <i>so</i> complex, almost no vegan understands enough of the science of human biology, nutrition and agriculture to properly assemble a diet for themselves (as demonstrated through dozens of studies). Various critical dietary issues are often waived away or minimized (just eat yeast extract!) and major deficits are often covered up under a handful of dietary supplements (many of which are derived from animal sources) for long-term adherence.<p>The flip side of the problem is that modern food practices <i>also</i> provide animal sources <i>far</i> in excess of what we evolved to need nutritionally. You could probably eat a vegan diet 4-5 days a week, and eat a healthy omnivorous diet just for dinner the other 2-3 and easily satisfy all your animal sourced nutritional requirements and come out extremely healthy with none of the Vegan diet associated health problems. And I don&#x27;t mean a huge steak for those dinners. I mean just a regular old meal with a few ounces of some animal sourced protein.",1412461414

Thus far, neither any device&#x27;s UID key or (what would be useful to jailbreakers) the shared GID key has been publicly extracted; what gets extracted are secondary keys derived from the UID and GID keys, but as the whitepaper says, the passcode lock key derivation is designed so that you actually have to run a decryption with the UID to try a given passcode.

Though I personally think it&#x27;s kinda stupid from the business POV to pay for producing the intellectual property and not selling wherever possible (look at Apple, I think lately they maintain their profits just by selling their wares in even more countries, and even faster) Also, there&#x27;s much evidence that shows that companies can successfully sell several similar brands in parallel, effectively expanding their profits by market segmentation, price discrimination or whatever. But Hasbro is a big сo., moves in mysterious ways and has the right to it. What ticks me off is that Enterplay representative wouldn&#x27;t (couldn&#x27;t) even tell me as much as why they can’t sell the game into my country. Indeed, it took pestering him with repeated inquiries to even admit that they can&#x27;t! Enterplay is a small company, and should be approachable in theory. It doesn&#x27;t look like they are overwhelmed with demand for their game and can easily afford ignoring honest inquiries from fans that wont to help promote it, either. I think I can well be the first Russian (or one of the few, anyway) to email them. So it almost looks to me like they are afraid to talk to me because they don&#x27;t know if they can. The few times they did reply, they did pretty fast.<p>Hasbro does license MLP brand in Russia, to some extent: the first couple of seasons were dubbed and shown on kids&#x27; channel (no love from the fans for that, of course) and the merchandise is selling, too. So I really don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a reason to not license MLP TCG, when they do already sell other MLP stuff.<p>Speaking of which, I haven&#x27;t up to this moment thought that the situation with Hasbro or with Trader Joe&#x27;s can do something with licensing, or that apparently parallel import _can_ be illegal at all. I guess I naively believed in the primate of private property and that if you are selling something you may not forbid buying it (unless it&#x27;s some kind of regulated thing e.g. guns or drugs).<p>All this makes me want to become an anarchist of some sort.<p><pre><code>    Hasbro has an odd relationship with MLP CCG in the first place.\n</code></pre>\nCannot argue with that. Do you know that the reason you don&#x27;t &quot;tap&quot; cards in MLP TCG, but &quot;exhaust&quot; them instead is because &quot;tap&quot; is a registered trademark. Apparently, Hasbro can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t allow one of its subsidiaries use a trade mark of their other subsidiary, even if it&#x27;s basically their own! Crazy stuff, right? Finnish fans told me that.<p>I talked to Finnish fans at Crystal Fair con, who introduced me to the game. I was a couple of minutes late to the start of the panel and I was used to GDC (used to take part in Russian one), so when I saw guys confidently explaining how the game works, I thought they were the developers (that&#x27;s the way it is at developer conferences). Turned out, those were the enthusiastic fans who learned of the game and wanted to promote it in Finland to create a wider audience, so that Hasbro/EnterPLAY would notice and start selling it officially, which should drop the prices, bring in official tournaments with developer-supplied prizes and expand the audience even further; that&#x27;s their plan. They arranged the first ever unofficial (draft) tournament in Finland on the next day of the con. Half the people just heard of the game, like me, and I found it fun. So I thought: why not try the same in Russia? Only the situation is one step further removed for me: to the best of my knowledge, there&#x27;s no store that sells the game in Russia, so thought of buying stuff on Amazon myself to get things going. With the ridiculous markup on TCGs in Russia, I could even break even with all the postage included, if I get lucky.<p>In Finland, they already had the stores that sell the game, despite not being released there officially; so they only had to find the one that allows them to sit and play, and went from there.

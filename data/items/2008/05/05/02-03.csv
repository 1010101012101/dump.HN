The cultural context is important when it comes to understanding the less formal common grammar we humans tend to use more frequently and which is littered throughout the Internet.<p>We can understand 400, 800, etc year old text, but one of the first things you'll notice is the language has terminology and informal phrases that may die off, live on, or evolve over the years. Toss in ambiguity, metaphores, double entendres, etc and it's not as simple. Perfect example would be Shakespeare. His style is rife with creative linguistic twists.",1209956393

How many votes that comment has shows the bias here.<p>The ""in that short of a time"" part was the qualifier. Microsoft knew going in that they weren't going to take the lead. It's called an investment, and it's the same thing they did with the Zune. Unlike the Zune though, they've captured an impressive amount of market share quickly with the Xbox 360.

They are not looking for creative or independent people.<p>And so making fun of Web 2.0 makes sense as a way to focus their employees' attention on producing high quality implementation rather than attempting novelty at the application level.<p>In fact, computer science departments probably do this as well as a way to try to maintain their students numbers given the current focus of computer science.",1209955785

I'm not running much on my Firefox -- just ABP and Firebug, which is usually disabled until I need it.<p>Based on what I've read, Firefox's memory trouble is not just about memory leaking, but also about a less-than-stellar memory allocator which causes it to fragment its heap badly, which in turn forces it to continue to grow its heap ever outward. In FF3 the Mozilla team spliced in FreeBSD's jemalloc and that seems to work better.",1209953358

JavaScript has the ability to piggyback off the browser's HTML/CSS rendering engines.<p>A lot also has to do with their respective cultures - as a JavaScript dev, you learn to do more with less because doing more with more is so exquisitely painful.  That's why Flash UIs are often visually more attractive - it's easier for them to be visually attractive.<p>And JavaScript compresses <i>really</i> well - it's not unusual for GZipped + minified JavaScript to be less than 20% the size of the uncompressed source code.",1209953079

This seems better than that. It will surely make it's mark.<p>Well, he's anyway found out a new kind of protest 'online protest'. Better than online petitions. And it's close to live protest :)<p>Your point to invest in Anrdoid apps, I agree. He should just go abt developing an Android port of the game. Google would anyway soon open up a payment system for the android market place and now since the android market place has very few apps, he surely has the advantage of getting noticed there.<p>I would like to know the result of this protest once it ends.<p>P.S: As a sign of good will, we all hackers should click that blue ""let Nintendo know"" link and mail Nintendo about it. My mail contents included the url to the website and ""We want to play Bob's Game""",1230551856

412911,comment,412757,412862,0,0,silencio,,,"The big problem with iPhone apps is that there is no way to get initial preapproval before starting work, and where Apple defines what is acceptable for the app store is fairly vague and not consistent. There've been plenty of cases even mentioned here on HN of developers who spent x amount of money and y amount of time on an app that was rejected or ignored by Apple.<p>I'm not sure why Apple doesn't do it. It's not like anyone's asking them to approve apps for the store at the idea stage...I think most devs would be satisfied with getting conditional approval for their ideas, subject to additional reviews (i.e. implementation) before it is approved for the app store. If Apple wants to charge more, so be it, at least it would remove the uncertainty of clients not sure if their app would be approved and developers wary of wasting their time.<p>I would definitely find that useful, as I'm sitting on one half baked iPhone app and idea that, depending on how you interpret the iPhone dev agreements, may or may not be offensive in nature. I don't want to continue spending the dev time if Apple decides it's too offensive, but it would be pure agony if I found out someone else had the same idea and was approved.",1230551439

412904,comment,412757,412860,0,0,silencio,,,"> It's a great marketing ploy though.<p>Just like online petitions...right?<p>The sad news is Nintendo probably doesn't care even about the public backlash stemming from this 100 day protest. Actually, what backlash? A lot of the criticism I've read on neogaf, kotaku, joystiq and others is criticism of the game and the developer, and not much of Nintendo's actions, especially from people who seem to know something of the whole process.<p>I personally think he should invest a big chunk of time into Android and iPhone ports of the game, as well as XBLM and maybe even a regular ol' PC version. I can't speak for Nintendo, but I'd take impressive iPhone app store sales over the dev locking himself in for 100 days any day. And he's spent so much time on the game that it seems a waste not to port to other platforms anyway with all that publicity and effort and with Nintendo ignoring him. Imagine what kind of sales World of Goo would get if/when they release an iPhone port.<p>Don't get me wrong, I think what he's done is impressive for a one-person job, but he's not doing such a great job selling himself or looking into alternatives earlier.",1230550754
412899,comment,408786,409871,0,0,david927,,,"I understand what you're saying Mark and I agree. I think waitress was an unfortunate example, though. Maybe I can offer a different perspective of what you're saying:<p>There's a 'pyramid of necessity' with ""materials production"" at the bottom, and at the top things like branding and marketing.  In an expanding economy, such as we've had for the last 60 years, the top adds all the value (so, for example, you can just outsource the bottom).  Generic bleach is often overstock from Clorox.  Same product, but you're paying more for the name, image, etc.  Service and finance industries fall in toward the top of the pyramid.<p>In a contracting economy, as we have now, the pointer on the pyramid drops relative to the size of the downturn.  If it's severe, it's really only material production / commodities / etc. that matters.  Who cares if it's a Nike?  I need a shoe.<p>So it's not about ""real value"" meaning no value, but rather ""real"" vs. ""nominal"" value.  The bottom of the pyramid has concrete value whereas the top has merely the nominal value of what people are currently willing to pay for it.",1230550244

Recognising that a user interface that's strictly logical may, for illogical reasons, be less usable than one that panders to the user's ""irrationality"" is a good business decision.  Basing your business decisions around the recognition that people make apparently random choices is a Good Thing(tm).<p>You say that the humanity has been overlooked, but choosing someone because you've looked them in the eye and pressed the flesh is less logical than choosing someone based on their references and an objective evaluation of their work.<p>Any business that overlooks the human factor, including customers' potentially irrational/illogical decision making processes, does so at its peril.",1230550019

I got one, I loved it.<p>After about a year, the bit of the case where you rest your palms started to crack. The intarwebs told me this was a known problem, and should be covered by warranty. I contacted on Apple service centre, to be told ""no problem, just drop it in and we'll fix it."" Of course, it would take two weeks, and there was no way to expedite things.<p>So I tried another Apple retailer, and was told to bring it in that afternoon. ""Great,"" I thought, ""this is why you pay a bit more for a Mac - service!"" Unfortunately, when I got there they said the same thing - two weeks, no exceptions. After about 40 minutes of arguing and cajoling, the Genius agreed to do it there and then. Although I was pleased about this, it would have been better if they could have done it without the arguments.<p>I just bought a new Toshiba and passed the MacBook on to my daughter (she's a real Mac fanatic). The new PC is great, I'm surprised that I actually <i>like</i> Windows Vista, and it only cost UKP400. So if it goes wrong I could easily buy a replacement. I might even buy a Netbook with the cash I didn't spend getting another Mac.",1230549652

Sure, many people are always going to test the same way.  And some people will have personalities that would seem to fit the descriptions, but that's largely coincidence.  Consider these questions [1]<p>""You are almost never late for your appointments.  YES/NO""<p>People don't actually measure their promptness or tardiness before answering that question.  They just think ""yeah I tend to be on time"" or ""no I'm late a lot.""<p>""It is in your nature to assume responsibility.  YES/NO""<p>Even if you did have a good way to objectively measure assumption of responsibility, no one will actually do it on themselves before answering the question on the test.<p>Even questions like this:<p>""After prolonged socializing you feel you need\nto get away and be alone.  YES/NO""<p>Not everyone is going to use the same definition of ""socializing.""  I tend to read ""socializing"" and imagine a party with lots of people I don't know, where there's pressure to perform and impress and get drunk and let loose.  On the other hand, some might consider socializing to sit around the house with close friends and family on Sunday afternoon with football on in the background.<p>Ambiguities and subjectivity are pervasive.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp</a>",1317041978
3038628,comment,3038264,3038264,22,0,mcherm,,,"I am unconvinced. Any absolute deserves close scrutiny, and ""real nouns only"" is an absolute. In this case, it fails my test. I find that many things I work with (especially huge Java libraries) tend to have convoluted and difficult-to-understand webs of classes with the most confusing pieces named things like ""FooManager"" or ""FooController"". So the author of this piece is reacting to a genuine excess.<p>But Travis is overreacting. The REAL goal is to find a collection of abstractions that is powerful enough to accomplish what the program requires but as simple as possible (and as local as possible) to allow humans to comprehend (and maintain) it. There are quite a few times when I have found that one of these ""verb-like"" abstractions (a word ending in ""-er"") made things more comprehensible.<p>For example: the Gang-of-Four patterns ""Builder"" and ""Observer"" both end in ""-er"" and strike me as being well-named. ""Builder"" is an object with no purpose other than to create (initialize) another object or data structure. HAVING such an object is useful when something requires extensive setup or initialization, because it is easier to understand if the extensive initialization is kept separate from the core functionality. ""Observer"" is the name for an interface of things that observe... the names of interfaces FREQUENTLY work well as ""verbs"" since the interface frequently represents ""anything that does X"".<p>Similarly, I have often had a class such as ""DatabaseConnection"" and then created ""DatabaseConnectionWrapper"" -- a class whose purpose is to wrap a DatabaseConnection to do something like logging, error reporting, pool flushing, driver-bug-patching, and so forth. Suggestions that I call these ""LoggingDatabaseConnection"", ""ErrorReportingDatabaseConnection"" and so forth misses the key point: a different mix of features may be required at different times (eg: logging in QA but not in Prod); the fact that they are transparent wrappers that can be added (or not) in any order is a key feature of the design.<p>So my own advice would be weaker than Travis'. Instead of ""Don't make objects that end with -er."", I would say ""Be wary of confusing objects; those ending in -er are often confusing.""",1317041959

3038609,comment,3038522,3038522,2,0,Donch,,,"I totally agree with John's letter. When I was in primary school we had access to a BBC Micro with a Logo turtle which we could program ourselves. In senior school we had a BBC Master with the Domesday project, which was amazing at the time with decent resolution photos! The school was also lucky enough to have a ring network of BBC Micros with a shared Winchester Hard Drive. Later, we got access to Acorn Archimedes computers.<p>The thing that all these BBC/Acorn computers had in common was immediate access to a BASIC interpreter, and with the Archimedes, inline assembler. We had a great teacher who taught us how to use binary in bitwise operations. We were encouraged to write a program for GCSE computer studies and I wrote a library catalogue database without a backend database! A friend wrote a graphical calculator that he then went on to sell commercially. There was a regular Computer Club every Wednesday after school where you could do whatever you wanted - play games, write code, use *SHEET to do some maths...<p>All these things propelled me, later in life, to become a software developer and I'm glad I was given the skills necessary from school. Today, it's all about trying to get spyware infested computers to print from Microsoft Word in less than half an hour. A low-level hardware platform that is instantly programmable is a noble aim and I salute the Raspberry Pi chaps and hope you succeed!",1317041656

However, no one in my immediate circle, myself included, used facebook since college. I'm wondering if I'm living in a bubble or if others are hyping the effect of facebook ...<p>Let me add one carveout: for those who work at startups that write facebook apps, that time is NOT counted.<p>One thing which came up in the last poll was that people felt they were spending ""5 minutes per day"".  I would humbly request that you actually try timing how long you actually spend.  I found that, with all services (from aim to slashdot to facebook to HN) that people who claim to spend 5 minutes really end up spending about an hour a day.",1317040641

3038541,comment,3038247,3038349,2,0,Derbasti,,,"Mine started with a bunch of IDEs like MSVC, Anjuta, Eclipse, Winefish and Bluefish, interspersed with short bursts of Vim and Emacs every now and then, but that didn't stick. I used anything and everything, really. Those days were spent in a plethora of activities ranging from LaTeX to PHP to Matlab to C++. But again, nothing stuck, really.<p>Then Textmate. My first big text editor that I invested time in. Textmate proved to be immensely powerful for LaTeX. Matlab worked fine, too. C++ less so, but manageable.<p>Then XCode, which worked great for Obj-C and Cocoa. Then MSVC again, as required by my job. Then I added Visual Assist X to make C/C++ programming bearable, then added ViEmu to fight off boredom.<p>But ViEmu led me down a slippery slope. When I had to leave MSVC for ventures into Ruby, Python, Lua, XML, JSON and Qt I naturally started gravitating towards Vim. And during all those ventures, I continuously improved my cross language vimming skills way beyond anything MSVC had to offer.<p>When I finally came back to MSVC I found it lacking. My fingers now walked and breathed Vim, and every feature of Vim that ViEmu did not implement was crippling my ability to code. Thus I looked into extending Vim with the IDE features I missed.<p>This is certainly not the end of the journey, but Vim has proved to be an amazingly powerful tool. It is the first editor I actively look forward to using. Sometimes I get this exhilarating sensation of power when slicing and dicing the code with Vim, fingers flying on the keyboard and Vim moving and changing code as if by magic.<p>That is bliss. Thank you Textmate for getting me started. Thank you ViEmu for showing me the way. Thank you Vim for liberating me!",1317040232

I'm actually starting to become very skeptical of my own use of compass and sass.<p>SASS makes it extremely easy to generate loads of really complex selectors that are very tightly coupled to the HTML they are styling.<p>Mixins also makes it very easy to end up with badly bloated CSS. When a mixin defines a gradient and you apply it to different selectors, you'll get the whole bunch of browser prefixed gradient declarations repeated in lots of different places of your final css. A simple class with the gradient defined used in the HTML will make the final CSS much leaner.<p>Personally I've decided to limit my use of SASS/compass far more and follow a style much closer to what's described in this article.",1317038949

I'm in Ireland and prices are usually advertised as ex-VAT if customers have a VAT bill they're paying themselves (because they charge VAT). That isn't the case for Irish devs which is why it's noisy for me.<p>One other thing I noticed: I suddenly got lots of emails from promoter because the search terms I used were too broad. I have a google alert ""switch multi user browser ipad"" which works well, but promoter emails me every time <i>any</i> of these terms appears. I couldn't find a way to correctly match articles containing <i>all</i> those terms (is that possible?), so I had to disable it by entering a random string in the search field.",1317038529

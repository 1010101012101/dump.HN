Try getting a standard mac to work with the majority of projectors, without any adapters. The LibreOffice issues you are having are due to an arms race where Microsoft break compatibility with their previous formats each release. You have to learn to use the computer you have properly or you will embarrass yourself with it. This is true for all operating systems. Not everything is going to work exactly as you suspect, at least you're in a position to do something about it on your own linux machine. That's never going to be the case with the competition.<p>Give it another 100 years, whose software is still going to be around, Stallman's, Jobs' or Gates'? It's not as feature complete, but it has greater longevity.",1333792784

Well, it isn't.<p>It started with my profile picture being public, there is no way to disable that.<p>Then I did not understand the aspect of ""aspects"" because at least in my language no-one ever uses that word in any way remotely related to a social network. I still have not fully understand the idea. I think it is way too intellectual and not natural.<p>You do not get recommendations for ""friends of your friends you might know"". Of course it would be a privacy issue, I know that. But this is a crucial feature, if not THE crucial feature of a social network.<p>And one thing I was looking forward to and what I thought would let me find likeminded people in this network, the ability to follow tags, seems to be restricted to my pod. Or maybe there is just no-one using it and thus there is almost zero content.<p>The name is standing in its way too.

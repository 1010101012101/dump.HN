I'm a journalism student debating whether or not to get a minor in CS for the purposes of getting a job at a startup after college.<p>I've been working as a web developer for about 4 years, both freelance and full time with an advertising agency. I know PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JS + jQuery, all of them really well. I know how to use the command line, version control, and all that kind of stuff.<p>I have a Github profile (not on this screen name), open source projects, and a bunch of other skills like server administration that have gotten me plenty of work in the past, but never at a consumer web product company (except on a small-time freelance basis).<p>I'm also learning Python/Django and Ruby/Rails, working on projects in both at the moment.<p>So basically, I'm wondering if that's enough. My school's CS curriculum is based on Java and ASP.NET, which sounds to me like a big fast waste of time, and it would add one to two semesters to my time in school.<p>On the other hand, I would come away with good CS fundamentals that are language-independent. But on the other-other hand, I could pick up the same skills from MIT Open Courseware.<p>I'd REALLY like to hear from you if you're running a startup and doing hiring, not because I'm looking for a job but because I want to know whether a candidate without a CS degree faces a significant disadvantage.<p>Thanks!",1301421506
2383652,comment,2383649,2383649,2,0,rdwallis,,,"This is my first post to HN. Since this is a Hacker Community I thought you all might be interested in some stats and info about the project:<p>---<p>I think MagicScroll's doing pretty well in terms of uptake but I don't have any kind of tracking implemented yet so I'm a bit blind.<p>I've got just over 6000 users from the Chrome Web Store.<p><a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ghgnmgfdoiplfmhgghbmlphanpfmjble"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ghgnmgfdoiplfmhggh...</a><p>On my server logs I get between 700 and 900 hits to my cache manifest file every 24 hours with more over the weekend. As near as I can tell users turn a books page an average of just less than 400 times an hour. (Each page turn involves a round trip to the server for syncing purposes). More than 95% of the hits are coming from Chrome so I think there's a lot of room to expand.<p>---<p>I didn't build MagicScroll as a commercial venture but based on its limited popularity I do think it has the potential to create revenue, and I now hope to build a business around it. In the next month or so I plan to create a paid extension similar to Readability that will allow websites to be read using MagicScroll. I also intend to build an API for booksellers to allow MagicScroll to be integrated into their stores. If MagicScroll does gain a significant number of users I hope to integrate my own ebook store into it but I think that will be in a year or twos time at the earliest.<p>---<p>For those of you interested in the programming side. It is built in GWT and runs on the Google App Engine. I'm embarrassed to say that I don't have any real knowledge of javascript though I'm trying to rectify that. There are about 30 lines of native javascript in the project most of which facilates communication between the frame that holds the book and the UI.<p>The entire project is heavily cached and apart from unzipping the ePUB and some security logic everything happens clientside. There are obviously a lot of advantages to this and it was quite easy to do because I was working in GWT. In fact I found that the same logic on the client often runs significantly faster than it does on the App Engine server.<p>To do page rendering I'm using a very simple binary search. I draw a page with a certain number of characters and if it overflows I draw it half the size and then half between that and so on. It's quick but I have no idea how Google has managed to get their pages in Google Books to render so fast, or to change the font size without redrawing.<p>One thing I've perhaps overrelyed on is AsyncCallbacks here's part of the code that draws the book:<p><pre><code>        LoadDialog.get().show(""Loading Book. Stage 2 of 3"");\n        init(eacKey, new DelayedCallback<Void>(new SimpleCallback<Void>(){\n\n            @Override\n            public void onSuccess(Void result) {\n                resize();\n                LoadDialog.get().show(""Loading Book.

SimpleCallback is just like AsyncCallback but without the onFailure method. If an exception occurs the program halts instead of recovering.\nI made it so that whenever an uncaught exception occurs I get emailed about it. This has massively increased my stress levels but I think its contributed to the stability of the code so I'll probably do the same in the future. I now get less than 20 errors a day. Mostly if someone tries to use MagicScroll with IE7 or if they try to read an encrypted book.<p>Anyway thanks for letting me ramble, I'm interested to know what HN thinks.",1301421499

2383648,comment,2383379,2383379,6,0,michaelochurch,,,"HN effect. Can't get to it. Didn't RTFA, but intend to do so.<p>What did this for me was Panic Disorder-- not the mild anxiety attacks people get after 6 cups of coffee, but real panic attacks that throw bizarre and terrifying symptoms that cause a singular sense of impending doom. Attacks don't last long but they can mimic (in no particular order) stroke, MS onset, heart attack, bad trip/drug flashback, vertigo, and cancer symptoms. (Note: if you have any anxiety disorder, don't watch House.) It's like your body and brain start trolling the shit out of your mind. Developing it was horrible and cost me my job and my girlfriend-- but I had a really great job and girlfriend a year or so later. On the whole, my life is better than when it started.<p>I don't mean to trivialize PD. Some people crumble when they develop it and become shut-ins. All mental illnesses are terrifying and awful. I was lucky enough to have the resources (access to some good doctors, great yoga teachers, and effective treatments-- a mix of self-directed meditation, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and medication) to make the problem 1-5% as severe as what it was when I started. And now I'm actually glad to have had the experience because (a) it led me to make some very positive lifestyle changes, such as my conversion to Buddhism, and (b) it has made me less anxious/fearful overall. The fear that people get when dealing with difficult people? That's nothing. No, seriously. It's nothing. If I can go from sheer terror to calmness in four minutes and be fine, I can deal with difficult social situations, as they say on Reddit, ""like a boss"". Panic disorder makes it pretty much impossible for someone to terrify me to even 1/1000 of the worst extent I've experienced.<p>That said, I wouldn't advise PD if it were elective. Panic attacks are harmless but hellish, and having intense negative experiences is generally considered harmful. Also, the first year is the worst and will generally be spent on drugs that can take the edge off one's creativity. Still, I came out of it a better person. I got extraordinarily lucky in terms of the people and resources I had around me, as well as the relative maturity I had due to the late age (24) of its onset.",1301421458

Keep in mind that it's not just the amount, but the type of compression that's decisive.<p>Spatial codecs (also known as intraframe schemes) deal with each frame independently. That is to say, they don't apply calculations across a set of frames, even when much of the information is repeated.<p>Temporal codecs (also known as interframe, of which H.264 is the most popular example) achieve vastly lower file sizes by applying samples from one image across a set (aka a 'group of pictures, or GOP). This is fantastically useful for broadcast and streaming, since you get high visual quality in an efficient package. But if you try to DO anything with that video (reformatting, enlarging, compositing, etc.) the downside will become very clear very quickly.<p>Typically, professional shows are going to demand a lot of flexibility in post, meaning they're likely to insist on spatial codecs whenever possible.",1301421336

I don't know if Jacob lurks here but he would be the definitive source.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1996SepOct/0090.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1996SepOct/0090...</a>",1301420233

2383538,comment,2383193,2383484,27,0,Lewisham,,,"I would be happier if IEEE/ACM would typeset the damn articles. The International Conference of Software Engineering this year has hired a publishing company that have been sending manuscripts back for even the slightest failure to meet (their interpretation of) the ACM style guide.<p>I've gone through the process 4 or 5 times across multiple papers.<p>You can't charge $3000 for the benefit of putting a PDF on a website when you do absolutely nothing for the creation of it. If they did the typesetting themselves, I might (<i>might</i>) accept that there are some costs per article, but at this point it's obviously complete nonsense on similar old-world scales as the NYT's $41m pay wall. Putting PDFs up is a fixed cost, which, even amortized over the development of the site, is nowhere near $3000 per article over and above the revenue they are receiving from libraries and memberships.<p>We keep getting told that there are overheads in running a journal; that open-access can't work without significant investiture. I disagree. When all you are doing is facilitating communication (academics do essentially everything for free: write, typeset, review, accept/reject, organize conferences, and new things like storing source code and data for replicability like PROMISE or SIGMOD), you are just a middleman. All that's being provided at this point is ""authority"" because ACM/IEEE-stamped articles count towards tenure, and the rest don't (at least in CompSci).<p>This sort of thing is ripe for disruption: a competently written web app  could annihilate the processes that are in place. The only problem is selling the authority. A company like Google or Microsoft Research taking to the right people and bringing them on-board for a rival publication/conference would do that (MSR are actually quite well-versed in doing conferences, the Foundations of Digital Games conference started with them, and that's now ACM for authority). I think most academics are totally fed up with the status quo, so I can't imagine that's all that hard, you just need the money to have a dedicated person to do all the ""selling.""",1301420032

I'm sitting in Starbucks in central London right now (heading to the London Clojure Dojo in a few minutes :-). I got here by train and on the tube and I wouldn't dream of driving here. Looking out of the window, most of the vehicles that I see are buses and taxis, with very few private cars in evidence. It looks like a lot of people agree with me and wouldn't dream of driving here.<p>In my experience, many of the world's big cities have already driven private cars away (at least from the centre) and replaced them with an efficient public transportation system. Cities such as New York to Melbourne to Hong Kong are similar. The reason is that the driver really does pay a cost, being stuck in a traffic jam. If the public transportation system is good enough then it's an easy choice not to drive.<p>Of course, London already changes motorists to drive in the centre of the city so maybe that tips the balance even further away from car drivers.",1301419824

If anyone thinks they have particularly good insights into this situation and would be willing to take some time to chat please send me a message at throwaway1445@gmail.com<p>In 1996 my dad sold his shares of a software product and used the money to bootstrap the development of a business software application in a field that barely existed at the time, but has exploded since then.  Here are some relevant facts about the business 15 years later:<p>- Enterprise SaaS application \n- Annual revenue in the mid to high 6 figures.\n- Five employees counting both of my parents (my mom is the other co-founder of the business)\n- Located in a small city in a rural state\n- Global clientele \n- 80% of revenue comes from one client<p>The company was able to quickly attract a large international client as their first customer.  This was mainly because at the time they were probably one of only two or three companies doing what they do (now there probably at least 20 companies in the same market, and there is still huge room for growth). However, the company has never been able to scale, and while they have had dozens of small clients over the past 10 years they have not been able to attract another large client like their first one.  I believe this happened for two reasons:<p>1. The company lacks a dedicated sales force. My parents, who are two of the busiest people I know (for reasons unrelated to the business), have managed all clients and sales. Also the company had no active marketing efforts until the last year (most new customers were referrals or obtained by being a subcontractor on larger bids).<p>2. The software serves a very specific need, and solves a very real problem very well. However, as the company has progressed the software has suffered from bloat and code rot. With only two part-time developers this has meant it has been very difficult to actually improve upon the core product, move it to one platform (currently strung out between .NET and some custom stuff written back in the late 90’s.), and build the new features that customers have expressed interest in.  This is partially an engineering failure, and partially a question of where to allocate resources. For example, both of the developers spend a significant portion of their time writing custom code for clients who want things done slightly differently. This is great for revenue, but means the core product suffers.<p>Now a few relevant facts about me:<p>- Late 20’s\n- Bachelor of science, but didn’t start coding until about two years ago\n- Founded a start-up that has about 12,000 active users, but has never made the leap to anything beyond ramen profitable.\n- Extremely passionate about entrepreneurship and determined to run my own company\n- Never built B2B software, but have more of an interest in B2B than B2C\n- Live in Seattle<p>I’m in a bit of a transition phase right now and one of my options is to start working for the company full-time with a plan to transition to running the company in the next 3-5 years. I should also mention that I have sat on the company’s BoD since turning 21 and have worked for the company off and on since high school (before the company sold their software as a web-service they we used to order dozens of servers at a time, and I would install the software and run a few tests and then package the servers up to ship them to clients). However, I’ve never worked on developing the core software product.<p>If I were to join the company the immediate focus would be on significantly upgrading their application, which probably means rewriting the vast majority of it.  However, as I mentioned before I am a junior developer and harbor no illusions about the complexity of this software. Ideally we would like to hire an additional full-time developer to really lead the rebuild.  Personally, I would even like to explore going one step further and make this hire a CTO (offering them equity in the company).<p>The company has been profitable from the very beginning, but does not generate the revenue necessary to bring on two extra full time employees (myself and another developer), plus the extra costs associated with having a second office (ideally just a co-working space) and redesigning the software package.  My back-of-the-napkin estimates are that the company needs an extra $150,000/year over three years to fund the transition (the idea is that over 3-5 years the company would transition to being entirely based in Seattle).<p>My parents are understandably risk averse at this point and don’t want to put too much of their own money back into the company at this point.  So my questions for you HN are:<p>1. First and foremost I’d love to hear opinions - great opportunity or a recipe for disaster?<p>2. Is it naive to think that rebuilding this software package would make it more attractive to the sort of audience that buys software for $X00,000 dollars?  Spending time with our current customers and really understanding how they use our software, what features they absolutely need, and which they could do without would be a key part of the rebuild. But, how do I turn that into a “guarantee” that new customers will be attracted to the end product?<p>3. How would one raise money for a company at this stage?  It’s not a startup, but it needs the sort of early stage investment that a startup needs.<p>4. Are there incubators for companies that are at this stage? Any other suggestions for finding mentoring and guidance?<p>Thank you HN I sincerely value your feedback.",1301419259

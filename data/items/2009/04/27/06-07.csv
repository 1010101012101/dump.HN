You wouldn't do that, because it would be slow. So you have to recognize that what you're doing is <i>over-committing</i> bandwidth. You are relying on less than N users sharing. But, bandwidth is a freebie to employees. They gain and don't lose if they maximize usage. That means that they can and will pour effort into subverting any and all firewall controls. That's a race you can't win.<p>Looking at it economically, what's the answer? Obviously, you have to start charging for bandwidth. Treat it as part of the department's budget.",1240815428

580971,comment,580803,580955,0,0,netsp,,,"- Calling it inept internet advertising is missing the point. Adwords created a market for what is essentially a raw input very quickly. But all of the rest of the ecosystem had to be in place to drive bids up to their current level. I see this in action every day. We build or modify sites specifically to get the most out of adwords. Run the ad campaigns. Tinker with ads. Gather data. Tinker with the sites. Modify campaigns. etc. This drives up the value of a click via higher conversion rates. Because the environment is competitive, this drives up the price of the click. This is an economic cycle with powerful extremely powerful feedback effects.<p>The market matured over time and in some places faster then others. I think that in some places opportunities still exist, adwords bids remaining relatively low.<p>Remember that the adwords system is DIY platform, which got this system hyper-charged. The conventional sell-washing-powder-on-TV system took decades to bid up th price of air time. If you want to build a conventional sell-to-the-CEO channel, then the US, with its existing sales channels is going to grow faster. That doesn't mean South Africa will never get there.<p>- Credit System Issues<p>Adwords in not driven by online shopping. Bids for things like roofing, insurance or loans are higher then bids for phones, laptops or books. No credit or trust necessary, just a capacity to purchase services somehow.<p>Anyway, facebook & youtube do not have 'native' monetisation systems yet, so it's hard to say whether or not they will work some place.<p>- Penetration (of internet access) is beside the point. No access = no cost to internet services.",1240815036
580970,comment,580845,580845,0,0,cduan,,,"The basic error of this article is that it ignores the prisoner's dilemma problem. The basic idea behind that problem, as a reminder, is that parties acting in their best interest for themselves will, in certain situations, select a suboptimal outcome.<p>Applied to open/closed source software, the prisoner's dilemma suggests that parties acting in their own interest will opt for closed-source software, because of the personal benefits (trade secrets, market power, etc.). Thus, even if open-source software is more efficient as a general matter, everyone will go for closed source, resulting in an inefficient outcome.<p>The solution to the prisoner's dilemma, of course, is contracts. By binding the hands of the parties, you can force people to choose the more optimal solution. The ideal contract adds a breach penalty that offsets whatever selfish gain may be reaped from defecting, and thereby encourages cooperation.<p>This is, in effect, what the GPL does: it adds a penalty to closed source software (namely, you can't use open-source with it). If open source is indeed more efficient, then developers will be willing to forego the benefits of closed source in order to take advantage of open source software.<p>I think that this generally summarizes what everyone else is saying (""nothing would deter an unscrupulous company from stealing open source code,"" ""economic principle of free riders""). My own comment is offered as a general thought, not a precise cost-benefit analysis. There is much more careful thinking on this subject, much of it in the law review articles I read while in law school.",1240815033

They are not there yet, but test programs are already being rolled out (some transmitting the data via the power line, others using DSL).<p>Even just having online access to the overall consumption would be so nice.

The idea of being able to travel around for a year or two to many different locations while running a company appeals to me (and many of you, too, so it seems), but I would need a way to do remote presentations and collaboration with clients in real-time utilizing voice and/or video along with something to allow me to control powerpoint-esque presentations and a shared notepad / whiteboard.

If I were MS I'd start stripping deprecated API calls out of the OS immediately - force anyone who's still running an ancient code base that they refuse to maintain to virtual mode. This might light a fire under their asses to get ""Windows 7 compatibility"" (i.e. no lame dead API hooks) higher priority.<p>Back-compat has always been the main force that held MS back, I'm glad they're doing something about it.",1240813782

That people look at advertisements and a portion of which is actually converted to kind of a sale somewhere. The problem in South Asia, Africa is that this ""conversion to action"" is very very low. And that's because of a variety of factors, penetration is low, credit system is not mature enough, people dont yet trust businesses online yet, etc. Inept internet advertising is a symptom, not the cause.",1240813123

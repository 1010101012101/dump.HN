At least here, I can say &quot;Look bucko, the Linux kernel itself uses them.&quot;<p>I decided we can do programming at the API level and never have to think to <i>how</i> that API gives us the right answer.  Lower-level programming is responsible for optimization when our number of data points gets larger.<p>And we could go even lower level and ask why the algorithms work in the first place - which is the computer science aspect.  I routinely deal with developers who feel they do not have time for this.<p>Also, if the data is small enough scale, we can brute-force it and nobody will notice.",1385294359

Time to take off your lawyer hat and read again what I wrote.<p>I have <i>not</i> written whether I believe the publication of those standards is legal under current (copyright) law or not. The point is that it <i>ought to be</i> legal because it is <i>moral</i>. It is moral because (at least for some of the standards, according to everything I have read about the topic) the <i>de facto</i> way of following a certain law is to follow the standard that was published. Whether there are other ways of following that law is made irrelevant by common practice (again, from a moral point of view, thought perhaps not according to current copyright law).<p>If necessary, the (copyright) law <i>should</i> be changed so that the law follows morality.",1385294323

Most people (not all) don&#x27;t really know much about their own religion, they just participate in the rituals because that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ve always done and they&#x27;ve had no reason to really question it.</i><p>I&#x27;ve observed that, but I&#x27;ve never understood it. I was raised to go to church on Sundays, but I found it about as enjoyable as going to prison. As a child, adults would tell me that someday I would start to like going to church, but it never happened. I seem to lack whatever gene makes people begin to like things and continue doing them just out of habit.<p>As an irony, I was a good student in CCD (Catholic education) and I probably possess more knowledge about Catholicism and Christianity than those habitual church-goers. I like to know things, but I can&#x27;t stand the tedious rituals. It just shows that knowledge of religion and actually practicing it are not related or perhaps negatively correlated.",1385293600

But the situation you describe has so little relationship to hiring that I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s relevant to anything.  In general, I don&#x27;t expect to see someone at the 2nd percentile of ability holding down a job at all.  Even very basic screening will keep them away with great reliability, because they&#x27;re so far out of the norm.  So I don&#x27;t see this as a case of &quot;sure, I made up figures that might be off by a factor of 10-100&quot;, I see this as you describing a situation utterly unrelated to any aspect of reality I&#x27;m familiar with.  You can&#x27;t just make some numeric tweaks to the model; the whole thing is fundamentally at odds with what you&#x27;re trying to describe.<p>Now, it&#x27;s definitely not true that you have to be below the second percentile to get phished: <a href=""http://www.locusmag.com/Perspectives/2010/05/cory-doctorow-persistence-pays-parasites/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.locusmag.com/Perspectives/2010/05/cory-doctorow-p...</a><p>But if it were true, phishing would be largely a nonissue for workforces (other than the police, who often <i>do</i> set ultra-low thresholds for their screening).",1385292410

You also wasted a lot of their time. And from an entrepreneurial perspective, they do not want people who don&#x27;t agree with their vision  (if you challenged that).<p>I was a core team member and the best in a big-corporate when they decided to start off a new product. I too &quot;strongly&quot; questioned their plans - and had also backed that up with presentations, projections (and better EXCEL skills). They did not have a answers to my questions and said &quot;Trust us, it will work&quot;. Slowly I got sidelined and one day &quot;declared&quot; as a pessimist in the project and that it was good to have my inputs. &quot;Wow&quot;. It was just a nice way of saying STFU. 4 years later - my projections proved to be right, and the product is in a worse state than I had expected. But they still pump in money and sales is slowing moving it towards breakeven.<p>$70K and at 25 with no family, you have a decent runway - but not the most comfortable. If you try to be a minimalist and use it wisely (which is hard at 25), this will work out to be enough to startup.<p>However, before you do your startup - you need to mature a bit more about life and people in general. Life doesn&#x27;t end at 29-30. $150k p.a. is not bad. Its okay to be ambitious, but learn to be grateful and respect yourself for what you have achieved. Those qualities will be required in a long journey of entrepreneurship. And you also have couple of years to allow yourself to fail, learn from it and start again.",1385292032

6789327,comment,6781186,6783170,2,0,balajis,,,"Great question. The short answer is that there are many social goods which are only available when people of like mind are in the same physical location. Among other things:<p>1) Walkable communities where everyone has some things in common are extremely popular (e.g. college).<p>2) By contrast, today many of us live corridored lives in anonymous apartment complexes, knowing more people at work than at home. Just from an efficiency perspective, that is a huge waste of time and life. Every single person there has to do a commute (or get on the internet) to meet people they know.<p>3) The specific location that people end up concentrated at is unimportant. But being located near someone else will be extremely important for the foreseeable future; among other things: you can&#x27;t read body language, you can&#x27;t yet easily collaborate on physical objects, and people can&#x27;t yet reproduce over the internet :)<p>4) In more detail, it&#x27;s a bit like dinner. Whether you meet your friends at place X or place Y doesn&#x27;t matter. What matters is that you meet your friends in person. You could be more technically precise and say only the variance in location matters, and not really the mean (the specific spot on the surface of the earth).<p>Anyway, I have a much longer version of the essay (really, a short book) that I had to edit down which went into this and related qs.

Now l8tr gets constant use, but I'd hardly call it a start-up.   Tagmindr sounds similar, a useful little thing that happens to be on the web.<p>John.

Rather than Jython, I'd hope for a tool that would turn python straight onto Davlik bytecode.<p>Hopefully there should be either documentation/source for the VM at some point or an enterprising person is reverse engineering it as we speak.",1194949173

79149,comment,79128,79128,0,0,lsb,,,"I came to Javascript from Ruby/Scheme/Haskell, so when I had to call the Yahoo Search API with a callback, sometimes with two or more searches concurrently, I thought, oh, I'll store the continuation, because they only allow /[A-Za-z0-9.]+/ as characters in the callback.<p>
var fns = [];<p>function gensym() { return $R(0,20).toArray().map(function(){return String.fromCharCode(Math.random()*26+65)}).join('') }<p>function storefunc(f) { var g = gensym(); fns[g] = f; return 'fns.'+g }<p>function jsonk(url,hash,k) {
  var s = document.createElement('script');<p><pre><code>  s.src = url+'?'+$H(hash).merge({'callback': storefunc(k)}).toQueryString();

  document.body.appendChild(s);

  return s.src</code></pre>
}<p>
I learned gensym and web-read-k in Scheme at Brown (thanks, Shriram!), and jsonk turned out to be pretty useful, because the same comtinuation-passing style that's available when you do XHRs now becomes available when you do json requests from a different domain, if they have a callback parameter.  (I brought this code to Songkick, and we shortened callback to k.)",1194949040

I already know that a number of people use POPFile to do things like sort ""interesting"" from ""uninteresting"" messages (e.g. one journalist uses POPFile to automatically filter out press releases that don't interest him).<p>However, one issue with comments is that they can be short leaving not a lot of text to work with.<p>John.

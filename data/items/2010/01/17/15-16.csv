There's a separatist movement down there with close ties to Gambia, so the Senegalese government's probably trying to dilute their influence by diluting their demographics --- bringing in Francophone immigrants who are completely clueless about local society (and thus dependent on the central government at first).<p>Ironically this is the same strategy that Rafael Trujillo used to strengthen the Dominican Republic's border with Haiti back in his day.

The attitude was almost anti-science and was in any event highly ""humanistic.""<p>Now creativity and technology appear to be closely coupled in the eyes of young people in academic settings, to the point where information technology, at least, is seen as having almost redemptive qualities.<p>Not saying any of this is profound - just wondering if others have observed this changed perception as well or have thoughts on how it might have come about. Is it because technology became ""personal"" as opposed to ""corporate""?<p>By the way, don't play Fritz as a chess adversary - it is like playing a demon from hell!",1263743869

A performance problem can have multiple contributors.<p>My point is that you would think Adobe would push on it with all of their talent since it's in their best interest to optimize.

Most glaciers refreeze somewhere, seasonally. Glaciers don't form at all at sea level at the equator, and haven't for a long, long time, but that hasn't stopped glaciers from forming elsewhere. As I experience an exceptionally snowy and gelid Minnesota winter (I have lived in temperate Minnesota or Wisconsin every winter of my life but for about six when I lived in subtropical Taiwan), I'm not seeing any radical climate change here yet, and the current weather pattern could hardly be called ""warm"" even on the historical pattern observed in my lifetime.<p>Weather varies all over the world. Climate change over broad historical time and especially over deep geological time is an established fact, but also has nothing to do with human activity. It's not entirely clear that the trade-offs of anthropogenic global warming, a phenomenon I accept as a fact, are all harmful trade-offs or even mostly harmful trade-offs for the majority of the human population.",1263742948

This attitude pisses me off, since it prevents us from learning from everyone else on this rock.<p>Well it's generally true, one important factor is the Chinese way of thinking & culture is very different from the western. Chinese has their own definition of good and evil. It's easy to understand western beliefs, but it's damn <i>hard</i> to practice them.<p>Currently there's a trend on the Internet, that it's patriotism to damage foreign companies, no matter what kind of dirty method you use. For patriotism, any kind of line can be crossed.<p>Another example is Chinese people <i>actively reject</i> the idea of universal values no matter what content they are. I remember not long time ago a Party official speaks to media , calls 'human right' an American thing, even though it's ridiculous and laughed at after this made public, but it largely reflects part of Chinese subconscious mind. There's no extend of human rights in Chinese history & culture, or rarely advocated.<p>In my theory, this is a language barrier. Universal Values, human rights, democracy are all looks clumsy foreign concepts, it's not native at all, it looks like you are running a GTK app on Windows. It functions but it looks <i>odd</i>.<p>To pass these ideas and stuff to China, I think direct porting (aka, translating and interpreting) is very ineffective, it has to be rewritten from the source code level, and use native Chinese APIs :)",1263741811

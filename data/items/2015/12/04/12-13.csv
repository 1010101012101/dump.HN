At the very least you should google a few keywords and look at the first 5 pages before raising it with someone else.<p>- Don&#x27;t ask things you can easily find yourself. I&#x27;ve had junior engineers asking me &quot;does git blah has a flag for ...?&quot;. It&#x27;s disrespectful of that person&#x27;s time.<p>- Don&#x27;t question every tiny little thing you come across. Organisations can&#x27;t maintain perfection, there&#x27;s gonna be ugly things and people are aware that there&#x27;s always room for improvement. Sometimes there is complicated history behind things that look stupid on the surface. Some things are the way they are just because they are. Not everything has some grand reason or justification behind it. Sometimes people keep asking questions like &quot;Why was this written this way? Why was it not written that way? Why can&#x27;t we make it better? Why can&#x27;t we make it faster?&quot;<p>- Remember the ugly crap you are seeing today was someone else&#x27;s shiny shit some time ago and you are not an exception. The cycle will continue and the perfect little happy function you are writing today that&#x27;s gonna solve everyone&#x27;s problems is going to be the next person&#x27;s ugly crap to rewrite and refactor and clean up after you have moved on.",1449233959

The US is a country where it&#x27;s very difficult to live without a car, except in certain major cities.<p>In order to do this, we need to rethink how we design cities. Right now, unless, as you point out, you live in a major city, it just isn&#x27;t well laid out for public transportation. No amount of retrofitting is going to help. City planners need to take public transportation into account when they issue new building permits, etc. They need to encourage business to build closer so people can use public transport.

We used the local hospital for Chemo and everything else at the Children&#x27;s Hospital 1.5 hours away for his legs and lungs. I would always have to wait 20-30 minutes to get a DVD of the studies (PET, CT Scan or MRI even ultrasound, but those are worthless) and then bring them to the doctor.  The doctor would be forced to use whatever the portable image viewing program that came on the DVD and then they had to be sent to the IT Department to be imported into their system.<p>We would be there to remove some horrible tumor but before half his surgeries (I can&#x27;t count how many surgeries he had) we would have to go in the day before (3 hour round trip) to get the expensive scan done again. One time I had a scan at 11 PM - Midnight and then drive home around 2 AM and be back at the hospital at 7 AM check in for a 10 hour surgery. ALL BECAUSE THE FORMATS ARE CLOSED and SYSTEMS could not connect so that my son&#x27;s records were all the same every where. I carried 20 DVDs with me all the time just in case.<p>In case you are wondering my son unfortunately passed away after almost 5 years of fighting. If you are ever interested in giving to a cancer society please consider stbaldricks.org. Most charities give 0% or 2% to pediatric research and that is why we went over 20 years without a new chemo for children till last year, which St Baldrick&#x27;s funded the research for this amazing new drug to fight a different type of cancer my son did not have.",1449233120

However, there&#x27;s other considerations at play.<p>The purpose behind a &quot;trial by one&#x27;s peers&quot; is to ensure that the people, and not the government, is delivering the verdict. The judge&#x27;s role is to instruct the jury on the points of law being argued on, because he or she (along with the other lawyers in the room) is the trained expert.<p>For the trial to have gotten to this point, the judge needs to determine that there&#x27;s enough evidence to even bring the case. There&#x27;s already been an expert check prior to the jury stage to determine if there&#x27;s a case at all.<p>Of course, as the article points out, many cases aren&#x27;t exactly &quot;Law and Order&quot;. (This has been cited as having an influence on cases), in that there simply aren&#x27;t the resources on behalf of both the prosecution and the defense to pile together tons of evidence or research every possible defense. I liked the references to 12 Angry Men for this reason, because the case in that story had little to go on.<p>The jury trial system, while seeming strange in all of the restrictions, are intended to try and obtain an untainted jury pool and find those who are as objective as possible. To the author&#x27;s point that &quot;all of the people of color had been weeded out&quot;, I&#x27;d note to the defense that it&#x27;d be wise to ask the jury pool if they believed people of color to be more likely to commit a crime, or other question to determine a presumption of guilt (just as the prosecution had weeded out those with a presumption of innocence.)<p>I can think of far worse systems of justice whereby state-appointed judges hand down judgements and sentences behind closed doors. So I&#x27;m skeptical about the USA&#x27;s system being the worst.<p>But it&#x27;s certainly imperfect, and that&#x27;s because judgements are handed down by imperfect people. And as I&#x27;m sure as any African-American will attest, it&#x27;s hard to feel you&#x27;re being judged impartially when you&#x27;re looking at a jury of 12 white men.<p>But you could switch to any number of systems, and at the end of the day it&#x27;s simply men judging men. The problem is not solved completely by a system, but by solving ourselves.<p>I found it heartening though that in this story, the structure of things helped. With everything arrayed against the defendant, there was no conviction. It just takes one person, one doubt, to look and go &quot;I&#x27;m not certain&quot; and that&#x27;s it.<p>And that&#x27;s exactly what happened. And exactly the way it should be.",1449232974

I&#x27;m currently serving on a federal grand jury, and several times a month they pay travel and per diem for dozens of people to listen to a one-sided argument by a US Assistant District Attorney to bring a case to trial. No defense is offered, and they can withhold as much evidence as they like. It&#x27;s a total waste of time, and I&#x27;m sure costs the tax payers millions of dollars a year. After witnessing how ridiculous the whole process, I read that in most countries the prosecutor simply offers their evidence to a judge, who determines probable cause.<p>But the most outrageous stories you&#x27;ve heard recently about grand juries are that even though they&#x27;ll &quot;indict a ham sandwich,&quot; police officers accused of crimes rarely get indicted because it&#x27;s in the prosecutor&#x27;s best interest not to aggravate the department from whom they receive most of their work.",1449232411

So here I go.<p>I&#x27;m curious to know why HN is overall supportive of Zuckerberg in this matter (based on top voted comments in similar threads). Here are my views and logics about this:<p>1. Just because a person is a billionaire, it does not mean that they should be treated the same as Buffett or Gates. If today there is a chance if winning a lottery worth tens of billions, and tomorrow a random person is a winner, is does not mean that winner is comparable to Buffett and Gates.<p>2. Warren Buffett became a millionaire in early 60s, then it took him 3 decades to be a billionaire on paper. Compared to this, Zuckerberg&#x27;s path to be a billionaire was at least one order of magnitude faster. This does not mean that he was a genius developer, or a great business man. Many people tried building the same app as Facebook. In my view, Zuckerberg simply won that lottery, the very same way that there were many pubsub apps out there, older and arguably better designed than Twitter, but Twitter happened to win the lottery.<p>3. The way Zuckerberg ended up with Facebook has always been questionable. The business model of Facebook is questionable. The way Facebook handles its users privacy is questionable. In a more similar space, Larry Page also had a fast track to the billionaires club, but what he built, and how he built it, is way more sound. There are many apps hat could replace Facebook, bit there aren&#x27;t search algorithms as effective as Google. You can live without Facebook without making a difference to you life, when was the last day in your life that you did not Google?<p>4. If we put Buffett, Gates and Page in one group, and people who won big lotteries in another, and I&#x27;m asked to play a machine learning classification algorithm, my brain would give Zuckerberg a high score of being a member of the second group.",1449231790

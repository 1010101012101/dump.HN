I beg to differ. 4k is <i></i>40 times<i></i> 100 bytes and that's a lot. I could understand a 512 byte sector cache but not full 8 sectors per <i>every</i> disk read. Especially for metadata.<p><pre><code>  > The JavaScript support is very optional (only db.eval and $where). When it used

Yes, and V8 will probably come soon in other architectures, too. This sounds good.<p>BTW, I couldn't find a stable release of Spidermonkey with Tracemonkey. But it could be my fault entirely.<p><pre><code>  > Why do you think its green and small? Its actually been used in production

It's just a personal impression based on who is using it (<a href=""http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Production+Deployments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Production+Deployments</a>) and recent bugs. Requiring 64-bit mode for files over 3.3-4GB is a bit strange for a database.<p>Again, I think it has all the potential and has a fantastic team.

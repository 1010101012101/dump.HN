I couldn't immediately tell what value I would derive from using your service -- eventually found 'How it works' at the bottom.  Maybe there's a way to make it painfully obvious for people like me.<p>Using ul/li for your central list, instead of nested faceless spans, will make it a little more accessible too.",1228204736
382782,comment,381462,381590,0,0,neilk,,,"When did IBM open up their architecture? They had an open architecture for the purpose of encouraging peripherals and software, not for the purpose of making cheap clones. The original PC BIOS had to be reverse engineered.<p>I could be wrong here but it's my understanding that the PC clone market was an unintended consequence of 1) doing the job in a hasty slapdash way with off-the-shelf components 2) handing control of the OS to a third party, namely Microsoft, without an exclusive license. IBM had just one tiny bit of proprietary knowledge, the BIOS, and once that was out of control, the PC clone market was up and running.<p>There was a time when Microsoft was the promethean hero bringing computing power to the masses. They really earned their dominant position back then, compared to how closed IBM and Apple were. Granted, the architecture and software were crap compared to many of their competitors, but Gates correctly analyzed that having the most open platform would eventually solve those problems.",1228204688

382757,comment,382049,382734,0,0,sh1mmer,,,"Right, but you didn't say ""Leah being good lucking probably helps"" you boiled her down to a single attribute which was looks.<p>Inc and the rest of the tech press have featured plenty of less attractive people who get a professional photoshoot and come out on top. They don't get reduced to being successful because they are ""hot"" because they aren't girls.<p>While I know her looks haven't hurt her career I see HN as a place where people make more rounded comments than yours. Just because you can say it that way, doesn't mean it's worth saying.",1228201492

After 3 years with PHP, I developed an app for a contest a while ago on Google App Engine using web.py. That was my first shot with developing a python web app. I'll give Django a try later. But since my web app deals with developing for plugins go blog engines, I guess I have to deal with some Python blog engines too.<p>Now since you mentioned Merb, I'm going with Merb. Just tried Ruby online on <a href=""http://tryruby.hobix.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tryruby.hobix.com</a> Seemed cool, so I'm sticking with Ruby this time.<p>Merb seems to have some problem with Windows XP. I get an error while installing it. But it's just the docs that generate the error. The main package installed. merb 1.0.3<p>P.S: Does trying out too many languages often make me a bad programmer? Should I stick to one stack of technology and learn new stuff as the trend changes or do I continue to do what I love to do?",1228201402

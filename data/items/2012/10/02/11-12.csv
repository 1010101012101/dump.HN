(Maybe Alpha is a marketing instrument after all? ;))<p>However I think for this problem, and many others, mastering a general purpose programming language is much more efficient.  After all you can pipeline symbolic expressions to Mathematica - or Maple >:) - and you have the best of both worlds.  Or you just use Ruby or another highly expressive language - the syntax of simple symbolic expressions is basically the same.",1349179197

There's some trickiness regarding cultural implications (for example, colors carrying different connotations across cultures). Navigating and using this shared language to meet your design goals is far more likely to succeed when you're aware of the considerations and use (or break) them consciously.<p>This doesn't mean that all design should trend towards skueomorphismconventions enter into this process, but convention isn't a nebulous affair either. If your audience isn't particularly specialized, you can rely on them being familiar with the UI conventions of their operating system, to a greater or lesser degree. This means that people will likley try to resize boxes from the lower right if you draw something that looks ""grippy"" there, unless they're at home in a RTL locale, in which case they might reach for the lower-left first. If you're overlaying resize controls onto a box, how are you going to draw those controls? Will you draw them outside your contentdoes your environment even allow you to do that? If you're drawing them on top, how do you ensure that they are easy-to-target without obscuring too much of the content? How do you deal with people who have poor sight or other vision defects like colorblindness? What about audiences who might have trouble using a mouse, like the elderly? What if your application has to serve all of these audiences at once? How would you even go about testing the decisions you make?<p>Of course there's subjectivity in how to execute this, but I've just led you through a thicket of constraints that affect your ability to communicate affordance using nothing but the illusion of pixels on a screen. Knowing what parts are science, what parts are convention, and how to effectively meet your design goals requires an understanding of the discipline. _Objectively_, without science your pretty interface might be pretty, but it might be a shitty interface, and you won't know the difference?",1349178480

If search engine monopolies are important enough to add ""friction"" to user interaction, then I'd say CA oligopolies are at least doubly so.  The conflict of interest factor isn't present in the case of CAs, because, AFAIK google doesn't run any themselves (yet), but I think its still very important to give users the choice.<p>I also want to point out that Google runs all kinds of infrastructural nodes all up and down the internet's stack. They have no problem pioneering high-performance DNS to move the web forward, and they even are running their own fiber optic network, for crying out loud.  They're huge on promoting IPv6 adoption, (mainly because it will remove any significant cap on the internet's (and thus their) growth).

I believe in Firefox and the power of Sync and I also believed in Thunderbird, especially the concept of an Android port.<p>Firefox on all platforms is a guest and I can understand wanted to have some firm roots. In one blog post I wrote that I'd have loved to see Mozilla put out a version of Android where they gut it and remove Webkit and replace that with Gecko.<p>Firefox's greatest problem of late is often described as a lack of imagination, but in truth, that's simply a symptom of limited resources. They're unable to induct a steady flow of volunteering coders and it's a shame. It's meaning that features are being neglected and delayed.<p>Take Panorama for example, users should be able to open Panorama and see all their windows on all their devices and open that in the existing viewport (window). The possibilities of Panorama are like something straight out of the future and yet it's been neglected to keep bread and butter features up to date along with implementing what is perceived as the uninspired design. Think about when Mozilla unveiled their plans for the Download Manager, literally a month or two later it was implemented by Safari, while Mozilla still hasn't completed their own idea. And I still think they should work on improving their feed reader, implement it in a way like Brief. I know when Limi came over from Google, he mentioned how little traction RSS has, but sometimes it's worth reaping the marketing on your niche features, rather than simply catering to the mass market and being thought of as just-the-same.<p>In regards to the philosophy behind Firefox OS, it doesn't take a genius to work that the App culture is here to stay for a while at least and that Mobile Web Apps are simply a Eutopian daydream. That can't be changed for now. What can be changed is that Mozilla work hard on making sure people understand the role of the web and the benefit that coding openly can bring. i.e. not using an embedded browser for authentication in your Android apps. Allow users to use Firefox so as they can use their stored passwords. But then, I'm a big believer that the Evangelism Team over as Mozilla needs more resources. The time for Mobile Web Apps will come, I'm sure, but not for now. The alternative is just so much easier from an end user point of view and it would seem that attempting to force the issue isn't helpful from a developers point of view either, ask Facebook.<p>Right now, Firefox OS's only competitors are Chrome OS and WebOS. It'll be interesting to see how each of those three evolve.",1349176228

Compared to a full hibernate, which includes a lot of memory pages in use by apps, session 0 hibernation data is much smaller, which takes substantially less time to write to disk. If youre not familiar with hibernation, were effectively saving the system state and memory contents to a file on disk (hiberfil.sys) and then reading that back in on resume and restoring contents back to memory. Using this technique with boot gives us a significant advantage for boot times, since reading the hiberfile in and reinitializing drivers is much faster on most systems (30-70% faster on most systems weve tested).</i><p>Source: Microsoft, ""Delivering fast boot times in Windows 8"", <i>Building Windows 8</i> blog, September 9, 2011 [1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/08/delivering-fast-boot-times-in-windows-8.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/08/delivering-fas...</a>",1349175640

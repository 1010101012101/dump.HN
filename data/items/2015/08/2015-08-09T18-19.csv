There are some low-level bugs embedded in very common C libraries which cause problems with single-word domains, and they probably won&#x27;t be fixed.<p>As for the original poster&#x27;s advice, the price of the domain you want in .com is probably more than YCombinator&#x27;s initial funding.

To a software engineer, a &quot;program&quot; is a collection of stateless routines and behavior. Data is external and separate, the same program should be able to process a wide range of data. &quot;Reproducibility&quot;, as much as that matters, is having a tested system that responds in a predictable and reliable way to inputs, and data is one such input.<p>When I first worked extensively with a scientist on an experiment, I was shocked how much common wisdom from computer science was turned on its head. One is expected to load up a Matlab workspace with data and code all in the same file? Scripts irreversibly mutate data, and often run exactly once? How could one possibly keep track of such an environment? How does one fix bugs in a series of commands typed into an interactive prompt? Reproducibility to a scientist is a log of actions that could be repeated by another human, but the environments used often just dropped such things on the floor, to be caught only by the most diligent researcher with an unusually well-kept notebook.<p>I think there is definitely a happy medium somewhere. Reproducibility as a scientist understands it; interactivity in a way that makes sense to a scientist writing a one-off script. Program state stored easily so that the scientist doesn&#x27;t feel lost every time they restart their environment, as I imagine they must do when editing python scripts in vim as a software engineer might. But all this in a world where scripts can be maintained and versioned and fixed without their hair catching fire.",1439144909

For me a few of the big ones arent technical-- CPAN as you mentioned, was the most useful repository of any programming community. Another one for me is that Perl documentation has conventions and one of those conventions is a tiny &quot;synopsis&quot; at the top of each page that shows actual code using the thing that page is describing. I dont think people understand how much this has helped-- and its been that way for 20 years. Of course, in Java to show how any simple library works you&#x27;d have to show the contents of at least 8 separate files but hey- who&#x27;s fault is that? ;)<p>Now that I think about it, the documentation in general (in Perl) was light years ahead of its time. perldoc, the included documentation is pretty comprehensive. The camel book came out when a lot of hacker news readers were a twinkle their father&#x27;s eye. Perl was a big part of Oreilly&#x27;s good ole days and it set Perl apart as a community that had really good accessible books available that werent CS textbooks but also werent &quot;Learn how to programmer in 24 minutes&quot;.<p>I dont use Perl much these days. Most of my peers are afraid of Perl or were told to hate Perl. They dont know much about it other than when to laugh at a Perl 6 joke. A few point out that python has come of age and greatly out performs Perl. Still, there will always be plenty of perl in ~/bin.",1439143782

One thing I had been thinking about though was the carbon nanotube wire and the ship.<p>Single-atom-thick wires used as knives have shown up in science-fiction before. In Ringworld, for example, a character is decapitated when they run into a nano-wire strung across a path.<p>In The Three Body Problem, I don&#x27;t think you could ever &#x27;cut&#x27; metal like that with carbon nanotubes - you&#x27;d have to overcome the cumulative bonding energies of all of those iron atoms in the ship and I doubt even the ship&#x27;s engines running at full blast could push hard enough to do that. And that&#x27;s assuming that a string of nanotubes has the strength to resist all of that tension. Apparently carbon nanotubes can resist about 100000N of tensile force (about a 10000kg weight in earth&#x27;s gravity), so perhaps it wouldn&#x27;t break - but I doubt that the metal in the ship would cleave, either.<p>Is there anyone who knows more about chemistry/solid state physics/materials science to comment?",1439143446

Recently, with 1.5, Go has shown that it <i>is</i> ready to take a hit on compile-time speeds.  I don&#x27;t think the argument of compilation speed holds for generics.

ATM wasn&#x27;t killed just because of design failures, it was killed in large part because of being crushed by Cisco. Ethernet fabrics were fucked up by Juniper&#x27;s poor execution, not because they are a bad design.<p>This thought process leads to unoriginal and restrictive thinking. Take the following bullet point: &quot;Central Controller = single failure domain&quot;. When you see that he wants you to think designs with controllers are crap. However, Google&#x27;s network uses a central controller to distribute policy and make QoS optimizations. If all of it&#x27;s members go down (it&#x27;s also a distributed system) it doesn&#x27;t take down the network, you just lose some optimizations. This gets them much better utilization >90% than the run-of-the-mill BGP folded clos junk that &#x27;experienced network engineers&#x27; churn out today.<p>Sorry for venting, but I see this guy&#x27;s attitude very frequently in the network engineering community. &quot;Oh, someone tried something like that once, and it didn&#x27;t work, so we are going to refuse to do anything that has an overlapping concept.&quot; It&#x27;s no wonder we still use command-lines and have to script SSH sessions to configure things.

I&#x27;m basing on I need to learn more about those other systems, I might revise some of my opinions, which are currently based on my experiences with the democracies I know - Poland where I live from direct experience, and few big Western countries from news and reading stuff.<p>> <i>By having democracy, (...) using money to gain influence becomes more costly</i><p>That&#x27;s a win only if the cost is too high to pay; as it seems to me now, the cost is higher but not limiting, so the result is that more of society&#x27;s resources are redirected towards that. See: presidential campaigns, and how much money, energy, time and manpower is wasted on what amounts to a zero-sum game.<p>> <i>I don&#x27;t think people are that stupid. I agree they can be temporarily confused by lack of information or fear</i><p>Yeah, I don&#x27;t want to imply people are idiots - but it seems to me that the state of lack of information (and sometimes fear) is a constant in our societies. From what I read about the history of democracy, its basic assumption is that of a population well-educated in the issues to be decided.<p>> <i>and that in representative democracy, there is a risk of the person lying. But that&#x27;s a problem with that system, and there are many options how to prevent that. For example, in Switzerland, on some referendums, people can get a summary information with arguments for and against. And often the debate itself is very healthy.</i><p>I wish to know more. I&#x27;d love if someone with direct experience of Swiss process could tell how good is it.<p>> <i>In all other areas of life, we call out the liar.</i><p>That&#x27;s actually my core problem with continued existence of advertising/marketing industry (I include political campaigning under the term &#x27;marketing&#x27; here). In other areas of life we don&#x27;t tolerate such nonsense. If your friend tried to pull on you the stuff that is standard practice in marketing, you&#x27;d punch him in the face. And yet we accept this from companies and politicians, and we even turned it into a respectable occupation choice.<p>> <i>As far as I know (at least in U.S. and my country), based on various opinion polls and so on, general public is pretty positive towards solving these problems. It&#x27;s the actual politicians who are reluctant to act.</i><p>The issue I see here, and why I blame the democratic process for that, is that people may be &quot;pretty positive towards solving these problems&quot; as long as it doesn&#x27;t require any sacrifices from them. Start talking about CO₂ emissions tax and suddenly you&#x27;ll be violently opposed by people. Point out we need a new nuclear power plant, and the NIMBYsts wake up. This feeds back into the democratic process and so (that&#x27;s why I think) politicians stay away from solutions. At this point we really need someone to force some solutions on people, whether they like it or not, and I don&#x27;t see how (representative) democracy can help with that.",1445309484

The way I\nsee it, it&#x27;s not that the memory\nitself is or currently has to be \ntoo slow electronically and, instead,\nit&#x27;s that the darned addressing is\ntoo slow or there&#x27;s too much of it.<p>E.g., to access a Fortran\narray with three subscripts, have to\ndo the darned array calculation --\nwhat is it, two multiplies and two\nadds starting with five numbers --\nfor each element of the array.  \nCan spend more time calculating\nthe address of the array component\nthan spend on the data when get it.\nYes,\na decent Fortran compiler will\nnot do that arithmetic just from\nthe beginning for each component\nof the array, especially in a loop.  \nSince C can&#x27;t do such arrays without\nthe programmer writing a macro,\nI have to wonder if C compilers\nare smart enough to \nsave on the array addressing\narithmetic like a Fortran compiler does.<p>Still, commonly,\nspend more time calculating addresses\nthan doing the work.  And to the\nprocessor core, the address calculations\nlook just like just more instructions\nthat might be part of something \nreally complicated instead of something\nthat has some simple patterns that\ncan be exploited -- the hardware\ndesigner would see the patterns\nand exploit them in the hardware.\nSo, the poor processor has to\nbe absurdly <i>myopic</i> and just\ndo what the heck it is being told\nto do.<p>Instead, for cases, say, heap sort,\nthe fast Fourier transform, and more,\njust have just one instruction for\nheap sort and, then,\nhave all that addressing logic\nin hardware and have it fast\nenough to keep memory fully\nbusy.  If electronically memory\nis still too slow, then have\ninterleaved memory -- since\nthe addressing is so simple\nand regular, the hardware implementation\nwill know how to\nlook ahead, much as in speculative\nexecution now except there will\nbe less or no speculating.<p>Some of this is now very old stuff\nand for just the reasons I suggested:\nSo, <i>super computing</i> has long\nhad an inner product instruction --\none instruction and get the whole\ninner product calculation done.\nThat is, an <i>inner product</i> is the\nsum on i of x(i)y(i) and is just\nubiquitous in scientific-engineering\ncomputing.<p>That is, generally the idea is to move \nsome relatively simple ordinary\ninstruction streams into\nhardware.  Again, the idea\nis old, e.g., was used for the\ninstruction extensions for\nhandling images -- one instruction\nand, slam, bam, thank you ma&#x27;am,\ngot some image processing code, that\nwas maybe before 100 instructions,\nin a loop, done.  So, get to save\non fetching and decoding all \nthose instructions\nand much of the addressing arithmetic\nthey would do, and the addressing is\nso regular that the hardware gets to\nlook ahead, e.g., which would \nexploit interleaved\nmemory.  And, in addition, might design\nthe sending of read commands to main\nmemory not just one at a time but\nas a list, boom, and with no more\nattention, waiting, synchronizing,\nhand shaking, the memory delivers\nall the data at all the addresses\nin the list.  E.g., something\nlike DMA for I/O.  E.g., to find a\nsum of the numbers in an array,\nhave a single instruction and\nhave memory just send the\ndata ASAP, much like in DMA \nfor fast I/O -- \non a machine with\ninterleaved memory, say, 16 ways,\nthat would just fly and scream\nat the same time.<p>For instruction level parallelism,\nsome old work showed that with\n24 way very long instruction word\n(VLIW) and just some compiler tweaks\non ordinary code, could get 9:1\nspeedup.  IIRC, Itanium was supposed\nto be a VLIW machine.",1445308748

Of course Watney isn&#x27;t going to bloviate on the nature of being human. We have plenty of masturbatory novelists doing that to death. Weir doesn&#x27;t have to be one of them.<p>The inspiring thing about Mark&#x27;s story is that he doesn&#x27;t despair. He doesn&#x27;t need to because he thinks about the problem and realizes that there is a way out. He works instead of weeping. This is hugely inspiring, especially as someone who struggles with depression. Watney even mentions suicide, but only as something he&#x27;ll do in preference to starving to death. In other words, one needn&#x27;t give up just because things seem hopeless, but go ahead and give up if they actually are. Don&#x27;t assume -- do the math and figure it out. If Mark Watney can find a way out of his situation, you can probably find a way out of yours.<p>Most of all, remember that there are others pulling for you, and that they&#x27;ll probably do anything in their power to help. Maybe they&#x27;re not NASA, but they&#x27;re there. They can&#x27;t violate the laws of physics, but they can do a tremendous amount, and there&#x27;s no shame in asking them for help.",1445307718

Biology probably has more in common with the study of history than it does with physics or chemistry. The difference I think lies partly in the power of abstractions relative to each field of study. Abstractions in biology are generally pretty useless I think, whereas in physics in particular they are incredibly powerful. It seems that we pursue knowledge in biology under certain misleading assumptions - that what we find in one system has some universality; that the dynamics of the system are not that important; that the functional elements we discover (or invent?) largely have one function. So we like to say that Gene X does this, then publish it. Actually Gene X does many things that vary depending on the context of the cell, the organism, the environment etc, which we neither understand nor have the ability to control very easily. The knowledge is mainly in the details rather than any abstraction about it&#x27;s function. We are confusing the issue by trying to think this way. It&#x27;s like trying to understand the empire of Genghis Khan by looking at ancient Egypt - there are some broad similarities, but what is interesting and informative are the specific details in each case. The problem comes with making predictions about the perturbation of biological systems. With faulty abstractions and no understanding of the important assumptions, predictions inevitably fail miserably.<p>Biologists work out the next experiment with their heads. Even the simplest bacteria or virus has been around for billions of years, shaped by interactions with countless other organisms. How can one human brain possibly comprehend the important details that are known, let alone everything we don&#x27;t know, to make a valid prediction?",1445306566

Every one of my cars has had a noticeably lower cost per mile on premium compared to regular (I&#x27;d love to quote the number but it&#x27;s been around 10 years since I ran the rest on my current car so all I recall is the outcome). I&#x27;ve encouraged several friends and family members to run the same experiment, and all reported the same result. Significantly newer cars with octane sensors might change this result, but I suspect it holds for most of the used cars on the market out there, so for at least some of us the more &quot;expensive&quot; gas is actually the cheaper gas.",1445306459

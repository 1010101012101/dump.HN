He talks about the Guard Bands put between two transmission channels to reduce interference, which is only an incredibly minor gain, if any at all.<p>White space actually comes from considering your frequency allocation on two geographic scales.\nWhen the allocator gives out tv spectrum, they make sure that two adjacent tv zones aren't on the same frequency so that they interfere, as you would expect.\nTV Masts cover a large area though, so if you are only transmitting a short range you can be cleverer.<p>Let's say you have Mast A transmitting in Zone A on frequency A, next to Zone B (etc.).\nIf you're in the middle of zone B, you can safely transmit on low power using frequency A, because you're too far from A to interfere.<p>This is what white space does - intelligently reuses unused bits of frequency at short range (shorter than a TV Mast).\nThis is already how frequencies for things like Radio Microphones are done - you apply for your licence, and someone in an office somewhere works out what frequencies you are allowed to use at your address without interference.\nWhite Space intends to do the same thing automatically, probably with some form of database based solution (using a known location, possibly from GPS).",1329223959

We carried their games as streaming for years (until Akamai purchased the company that was reselling us), allowing you to listen to every single game, everywhere in North America, every game day.  It was like NFL's season tickets on DirectTV, but for hockey. Fans love that.<p>The content owners who realize they can market mass audience content through traditional ""channels"" while also marketing niche content at a premium through direct ""over the top"" streaming, and that the niche offering does not cannibalize the mainstream offering, are showing the way.  NHL's less popular games, Champs car racing multiple cameras, Tour de France full coverage -- all these offer the die hard fan something more than they can get on TV, so the fans go for both.<p>We had fun working in the late 90's with the World Wrestling Federation whose shows were popular enough the cable companies wouldn't drop them even if they were made available as streaming.  A given PPV was priced the same on cable and on Internet, meaning the only people who bought it from us were the people who couldn't get it on their cable system.  The lift was significant and more than paid for production and bandwidth, back when bandwidth cost 100x what it does today.<p>Over the top can be a massive revenue driver when used to supplement or support your TV offering.

3589715,comment,3579847,3580596,1,0,tete,,,"Perl really has a problem here. Most people don't learn Perl as their first language. Perl is very flexible (There Is More Than One Way To Do It). I often come across code where I can see that this from C programmer. Especially when reading documentation of language bindings, which often are from C programmers. Of course you could replace C with any other language, but really, one can use Perl in various ways. This is awesome when you know how to use it and can create short and readable code, like when you want to describe something in a natural language and when you really understand something you can make it easy. In fact Perl is heavily inspired by natural languages. Larry is a linguist.<p>So there are two ways. Either read the Modern Perl book, which indeed is awesome. It's better than any other Perl book/tutorial and really, there are ones that really suck. What's awesome about it is so good while there is a free version available. In fact the source code can be found on GitHub.<p>It's really nice, because you will actually know how to do things, not just what the language is like. You will be ready to start your first project. It's also really nice, because it's written in a way that neither bores people who know how to program nor makes it impossible for someone who never programmed to understand it, even though it's probably pretty hard if you have no idea about programming at all.<p>An alternative is looking for stuff on CPAN or GitHub. I actually think that's often a better approach (at least it is for me). Learning to code by seeing actual code and having a reference. It's just kinda hard to grasp things.<p>Another approach is of course programming something and looking up how it is done. In this case it's maybe a good idea to look out for best practices.<p>Oh this is something else that's nice about Perl, but beginners sometimes don't know about.<p><pre><code>  use strict; # Well, everyone should use that\n  use warnings; # For more semantic errors\n  use diagnostics; # For explaining errors/warnings in plain Enlgish\n  use Perl::Critic; # That's a CPAN module that tells you what probably isn't a good thing to do\n</code></pre>\nAnd then there is an awesome community, called Perl Monks, which maybe is a bit like what Stackoverflow is these days, but way older.<p>Anyway, all of this is covered in the Modern Perl Book. So go for that book if you want to get into Perl (again).<p>Also, Perl folks are usually not too angry about other languages. This is also a great thing. They actually talk about problems and fix them instead of being dogmatic. Perl developers usually just want to get stuff done. If you can't do something easily in Perl itself, then you will usually find a solution on CPAN (see Moose for -very- advanced OOP).<p>I would like to see a lot of these things in other communities, but a lot of what makes Perl so awesome is that it isn't the new thing, but stuff that already had a lot of evolution going on. Sometimes you don't want that, but Perl folks usually are friendly towards other languages. Well, besides PHP, but that's more a cultural things. Perl culture alone is a reason for me to stick with it. It makes boring things more fun.<p>In other words: Give it a serious try. If you don't like it you can still go to another language and have probably learned a lot.",1329222306

Even simply things get complicated on X11 due to the client&server communication. A simple call to check the cursor-position can freeze your application for several milliseconds when the server decides to ignore your client for a few frames (and yes, depending on the application that matters - for games it's really annoying). Or adding copy&paste support will send you through a hell of no-longer-working examples and you can find lots of custom implementation where no 2 people tried the same workaround to ensure they really wait long enough for the server to respond and filter the right messages. I think the X people are also working on improving the situation when client&server are on the same system, but unfortunately you never can really ignore that communication completely and it will probably be many years before older X11 systems out there can safely be ignored.<p>I realize many people care a lot about the network part of X11. I suppose especially if you are working as Sysop it might be a big deal. I've not used it for over a decade, so obviously not something I care about so much.

Bugs, problems, bad runs, happen with everything. One personal case (or 10,000 or 50,000) out of some 30,000,000 computers, is NOT the determining factor in respect to whether a brand of hardware works reliably or not.<p>""Just works"" is relative. Given that Apple controls both the Wifi card and the driver for their machines, and that it offers a limited range of such cards, it sure is better poised to ""just work"" than some obscure wifi card used in a PC alongside with some third-party open source driver for it. This is, pretty much, common sense.<p>So, as relativity goes, it's pretty much true, or Apple wouldn't hold the higher user satisfaction position of multiple years in a row, with over 20% distance from the second runner.",1329221119

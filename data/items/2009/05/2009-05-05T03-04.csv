I own an iPhone but I don't own a Kindle, and haven't used one for more than a couple of minutes, but a lot of people I've talked to who own both swear by the Kindle's e-Ink screen.  From what I hear, for long periods of reading, and for outdoor reading, the Kindle beats the iPhone (and because of things like screen and battery, not form factor).<p>Certainly, an Apple tablet could do a lot more than a large Kindle, but it won't necessarily ""render it moot.""  The Kindle might still provide a better experience for the one function is it meant to: reading large quantities of text... and if there is a market for for a device that just does that (and there seems to be judging from the Kindle's early success so far), then it will likely continue to do well.",1241495733

593562,comment,590993,593130,0,0,lsc,,,"as for dedicated servers, the big question in  my mind is ""why don't they give you more ram?""   there's no reason to run a single socket with less than 8GiB and a dual socket with less than 32GiB  (well, not no reason, but in the general case.  Ram speeds up disk, usually, which is horribly slow, even if you buy expensive disk.)<p>I've found an interesting model for renting servers;  I charge a kinda hefty setup fee (like $500 for a core2quad with 2 disk and 8GiB ram.  within a couple hundred of the parts cost) but then charge $70/month ongoing.  (for one of my 8 core 32GB ram systems, with some disks thrown in, it was $1200 up front and $175/month)<p>It does lock the customer in, which is not providing value, but on the other hand, if they stay for a while, it's much cheaper than market rates, and I'm ok with it because the customer has covered most of my capital outlay.<p>I think the thing is that most of us small operators are leery of capital outlays that take many months to repay, and I think the large operators actually pay more for the hardware.<p>No, I'm serious.  every large company I've worked at bought pre-built servers from HP or Dell or whatever, and they always ended up paying a large premium over what I would pay buying parts (when they are on sale) for servers that did the same thing.   I think part of it was that salesmen are professionals, and part of it was that in a large corporation, the guy making the buy decision, well, it's not his money.  He's more concerned with making a decision that looks right than a decision that is right.<p>On the other hand after making an especially bad mistake I once said ""Hey, that was my Porsche.""",1241494763

I upgraded to new hardware and lowered prices.<p>Under Xen if there is available CPU, any user can burst to it.  I use the credit scheduler, which means you spend scheduler credits to get that CPU.  You gain scheduler credits by not using as much CPU.   Your weight determines how fast your credits accumulate, so a domain with twice as much weight, assuming contention, gets twice as much cpu as another domain.  I weight my domains based on the amount of ram they have, so a 64Mb domain has 1/4th the weight of a 256MiB domain.<p>The ceiling on how much CPU you can use when nobody else wants it is set by the number of vcpus you have.  I give you one, and in this example, slicehost gives you 4.  this is in an effort to make the jokers who run mprime all day (I'm looking at you)  from dragging down the service for everyone else.  And they don't.  I see some users who regularly use as much cpu as they are allowed, and it doesn't cause problems for my more restraned users.<p>my standard system has 32GiB ram and 2 quad-core 1.9Ghz opterons.   (I have one with 64GiB and 2 2.1Ghz shanghais, but most of that ram is being used as cache for my experimental ZFS domain, so it shouldn't have more contention than the 32GiB servers)<p>As for the number of domains, depends on how many users sign up for what plan.  62 domains are on the system that the user who ran this test is on.",1241493797

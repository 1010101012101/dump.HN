1880137,comment,1879764,1880092,0,0,swombat,,,"One of our interns this summer used to work in one of the London airports, where his job was basically to tell people that they were allowed strictly one bag, and yes, that little plastic bag they're carrying with a book they just bought counts as one bag, and yes, you're going to stuff your purse into your backpack because that counts as a bag too, and so on.<p>Very irritating stuff, particularly since it has absolutely zero bearing on security (why would the number of bags make a difference??), and so seems like a completely arbitrary imposition of force. I once chatted with someone who worked for the airlines and they said they didn't care about how many bags you carried (within reason), but the regulation is imposed by BAA (British Airports Authority).<p>So, our intern worked there for a month or two. Every time he let someone through with more than one bag he was told off by his supervisor after someone at the security checkpoint reported him, and eventually at one point when the guy was complaining about him once again, he had enough and he quit.<p>Why'd he do it? For the money. Easy money, not a tough job, not that risky. Yes, people think you're an asshole, but when you're a starving student with no money, you can cope with that.<p>I don't think being angry at these people would help any more than it would help to be angry at the piece of paper that a parking fine is printed on.",1289158953

1880134,comment,1879764,1879963,0,0,davidcuddeback,,,"I sincerely hope that enough people push back to make a difference.  I think for a lot of people, it's easier to just stop flying---and some people already have---than it is to protest the security theater.  If it's clear to the airlines that they're losing a significant number of passengers due to the security measures, I would expect them to lobby against the security measures.  Whether or not they will have an effect is another issue entirely.<p>I for one love travelling but hate flying.  I see two options for people who enjoy international travel but don't want their privacy invaded by TSA.<p>1.  Travel by boat.  You can hitch a ride on a cargo ship to just about anywhere in the world: <a href=""http://matadornetwork.com/notebook/how-to/how-to-travel-by-cargo-ship/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://matadornetwork.com/notebook/how-to/how-to-travel-by-c...</a>  It's more expensive than flying and takes longer, so this is probably not an option for most people.<p>2.  Depart from another country.  I recently traveled to New Zealand, and when I flew home from the Auckland airport to San Francisco, I had to go through an extra security screening because it was a US-bound flight.  I was left with the impression that airport security in the rest of the world is not as draconian unless one of the endpoints of the flight is in the USA.  So I suspect if you can drive or take the train to Mexico or Canada, you can avoid an unnecessary invasion of privacy.  Last year, I took an Amtrak train from Vancouver to Seattle, and the border crossing was a piece of cake.<p>Edit:  Does anyone know how airport security in Mexico or Canada compares to the US?",1289158886

I've had a few; but, then again, too few to mention.<p>I <i>could</i> regret having voluntarily foregone a normal childhood in favor of solitary intellectual and artistic pursuits, but then I wouldn't have had the foundation that later allowed my to do some really neat things for a living.<p>I <i>could</i> regret having dropped out of high school upon learning that I'd won enough in scholarships to attend Waterloo at a tidy profit just before graduation, but I'd probably be complaining about the idiots I have to lecture when I'm rudely dragged away from my hunt for a generalized solution to the n-sphere packing problem (which will, of course, be crucial to the moving industry when humanity evolves beyond the constraints of three-dimensional meatspace).<p>I <i>could</i> regret the ethical quagmire that was my military service, particularly around the time of the Oka crisis in Quebec, but I would have to do without the discovery that I am a rather good teacher of matters mathematical and technical, and that I can speak publicly with confidence about things that matter to me.<p>I <i>could</i> regret drinking myself half to death trying to solve the question of how to appear to be social while remaining comfortable in my solitude, but without a truly desperate need to save my life, I never would have been able to overcome the voluntary, learned autism I developed in childhood.<p>As jacobroufa said in an earlier comment, if I were to change any of that, I wouldn't be who I am today. And I have had a life that is nearly beyond imagining. I'm a high school dropout (I never did finish, or even get a GED) who has taught electricty/electronics and mathematics at college. I'm a ""failed"" musician (I sold six records -- not six different albums; six paid-for copies of my one and only album) who, as a utility sideman, played gigs with some of my heroes in the jazz and blues world. When educational funding dried up in Ontario during the '90s recession, I found that the only postion available for an ex-military high school dropout was shining shoes, and that drove me to but an obsolete computer and teach myself to program. It took a while (years) to meet my own admittedly high standards and to break into the industry at all as a n00b pushing forty, but I became a highly Googleable entity (once you figure out how to filter out the dead folk singer with whom I share a name) and had a reputation for innovative thinking within my little niche (Notes and Domino -- please hold the comments; the platform is much better than most of the applications written for it). No shoeshine boy, no Google hits. I've loved and been loved in return; I've had my heart broken and experienced loss -- and become more human in the process. I have a tremor disorder with an associated dementia now (and hang around places like this and Stack Overflow to stave off the decline as long as I can -- it beats doing the crossword), and suffer intermittent aphasia that sort of alternates between Broca- and Wernicke-associated damage patterns and am hugely unreliable due to physical incapacitation, yet I'm still asked to give motivational talks on a regular basis. (Yes, by people who have heard me before.)<p>We can spend a lifetime regretting the path not taken, and another worrying about the consequences of the next choice. But always keep in mind the sage advice of Yogi Berra: when you come to a fork in the road, take it. Read as a mere Yogism, it may seem inane, but if you really give it some consideration (as Yogi did before he said it) you'll find that it is an admonition to avoid the paralysis of indecision. There may come a time when you wonder what might have been down the other path, but standing at the point of choice, tossing coins for the rest of your life means going nowhere and doing and learning nothing.",1289158585

It's a historical accident that refusing to publish source code has come to be treated as a special exception to the principles of good scientific practice.  The more the basis for that exception is undermined, the more justified researchers will feel in demanding source code when they're skeptical of a result.<p>And here's the key incentive:  lack of source code can be used as an excuse for ignoring and devaluing competitors' contributions.  Scientists may be reluctant to raise a standard that would result in more work for everybody, but they can't resist a means of denigrating their rivals' work.  Once the cat is out of the bag, scientists with weak reputations and disruptive results will be forced to publish source code to prevent their work being round-filed.  Established scientists will find it untenable to hold themselves to an explicitly lower standard than everybody else, so they will eventually be forced to start publishing their code, too.",1289156913

Apple did it in 18 months.<p>2) A lot of MS Research appears to be done in a vacuum (with respect to Microsoft, not with respect to the research community).

If multiple parties have to agree on the board seat, then an intransigent investor can maintain an advantage by never approving any candidates. Don't put off filling these seats! Ideally, you should agree on a specific person before you sign the docs.",1289156507

So the whole ""if only"" game doesn't seem like a worthwhile one to me - if there's a failure, it's never, ever, about the market actually failing, it's that it just wasn't free <i>enough</i>?<p>Sorry, back to the drawing board then, and design a system that works in the real world.  It's probably not too far off from what we have now, and should be reasonably free, no doubt about that, but it should be designed to muddle along with the muddly creatures that comprise its actors, rather than some sort of idealized system that will never come to fruition.  Those apes tend to have both collectivist and individualistic tendencies, and ignoring one in favor of the other is a bad idea.",1231098973

Building anything on top of Linux/GCC/MySQL/Python/Apache will guarantee that the best you could hope for will be nothing but a miniscule percentage of it.

419392,comment,419012,419012,0,0,lionhearted,,,"A mix of some excellent advice and some very poor advice. First, let me highly recommend the best book on conflict I've ever read (no affiliate link either):<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Difficult-Conversations-Discuss-what-Matters/dp/014028852X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Difficult-Conversations-Discuss-what-M...</a><p>Author nails some good points about talking about yourself, and looking for solutions. One thing I really disagree with - not walking away. It doesn't really make sense to talk to someone while they're angry or heated up. So you've got a couple options - calm them down, and then talk about it, or let them calm down on their own. Depending on where you're at in life, your mood, etc, the second option can be really good. You don't have to be so formal about it. Something like - ""Hey, you seem pissed. Would it be better if I took off for a while?""<p>Lots of times you get ""No!"" Then you say, ""Okay baby, no sweat. Let's get something to eat and we'll figure it out."" Then make some tea, or fix a couple sandwiches (may seem strange to do this calmly while she's coming down from the adrenalin/anger, but very doable in practice). Then she'll come around and be back to being your very cool girl, with more of a post-adrenalin sad/regret mode instead of the fired up angry mode. I think it's a lot easier to communicate with someone you care about when they're calmed down, maybe even a little sad, than when fired up with righteous indignation. So then you say, ""Okay, babe, what's up?"" And she usually tells you without attacking you.<p>Then you've got a couple options. If you feel like you're in the wrong to some extent you can say, ""You know - you're totally right. I'm going to work on that."" But if she's got an issue with something that's you, that's not bad, that's part of who you are that you wouldn't want to change, then you can say, ""You know, God that's awful you feel that way. That sounds yucky... but y'know, I think that might be just how I am. I'm like a machine, I go crazy when I don't work 16 hours a day during my inspired times, and it's who I am. I'm not sure you'd even like me if I repressed that drive of mine... I hear what you're saying babe, and I'll think about it more, but I think that's part of me.""<p>People do respect this - the worst thing you can do is promise to do something that you <i>can't</i> do. And yeah, if you're driven, maybe you can't not work when inspired without going crazy. I can't. I go nuts if I have something I should be creating with my hands and I'm not doing it. So the girl in my life has to put up with the ""mad scientist in the basement inventing and doing nothing else but eating and sleeping"" treatment from time to time. And when you say that upfront, it gives her a chance to make a real decision without being led on that you'll change in an area you can't. If you're a really good guy, she won't mind the eccentricities and can accept them instead of being strung out that you'll try to change your fundamental nature and core values.<p>A final thought - you might think about trying to be kind but a bit distant after confliuct. Like very nice, calm, but absolutely not turned on or more affectionate than normal. Great makeup sex is absolutely a disaster - it practically guarantees more fights. If you're a much better guy from her point of view after she raises hell, she's going to do it. So let her calm down, almost be sterile and nice for a little bit after you fight or she attacks you. If you want to change, do it gradually after like a week has passed. If you're better to your girl after she's been bad to you, you're going to get more of that badness in the future. Even if it's a wake up call that you need to treat her better, maybe wait a bit of time so she doesn't make the association of ""feel bad -> start conflict -> better life"". I guess that might seem obvious in text, but it seems like most guys get it wrong just because they never thought about it.",1231096512

Reality is that many industries are monopolies or effective oligarchies: banking, telecommunications, insurance, pharmaceuticals...  The idea that these companies working in heir own self interest will counterbalance each other is nonsense.  That's why we need regulation.  The problem occurs when the regulated do the regulating, whether by infiltrating the government, bribing congress, or actually writing the laws.  And I will acknowledge that there is and has been a more than adequate supply of bad regulations.<p>Also we need vigorous antitrust enforcement so that the failure of no one company can bring down the economy.

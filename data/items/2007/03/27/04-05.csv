6539,comment,6505,6518,0,0,pg,,,"No, of course they didn't ask permission to copy the application form.  And it's not just the application form. Reading their site is a freaky experience, because I keep coming across bits and pieces of my own thoughts, and even idioms. <p>I'm a bit indignant about the whole operation, actually.  I feel like J. K. Rowling would feel if she came across a book that was set at a boarding school for kids with magical powers, with a hero called Henry Potter, who lived with his disagreeable non-magical (""moggle"") step-parents, his own parents having been killed by the evil Valdemort...",1174970394

6534,comment,6302,6413,0,0,gommm,,,"Those are the reasons why I'm moving to malaysia to create my startup....<p>1. Living cost are cheap<p>2. good internet access<p>3. lots of people speak english there so you can go on your daily life with english (good for attracting employees from other countries)<p>4. While I don't discount the usefulness of the networking effect in the bay, it's much more useful if you need investors... Since I plan to bootstrap my company, this is not such a problem....<p>5. Nice weather, smiling people makes for a place where people are not depressed....<p>6. I strongly believe that the best employees for a startup are curious and adventurous, an employee that is willing to relocate to malaysia display those qualities ",1174969063
6533,comment,6464,6464,0,0,Constantine,,,"It is an interesting equation, if it costs them almost nothing to create and 10 people buy it, the profit margins are astounding!<p>Not that I know anyone who would buy a facebook gift, but it still is a smart concept. You can see it a lot in some new Korean MMO games that have come out, where they charge small fees for equipment that doesn't cost them anything to produce after the initial design phase. This model isn't new by any means, but it always surprised me when it worked.",1174969038
6532,comment,6505,6505,0,0,zaidf,,,"I have been following Brad Feld's blog longer than any other blog. For sure TechStar has a solid lineup and I am sure the entrepreneur pool is larger than what YCombinator and TechStar can support together meaning there shouldn't be any lunch stealing between the two.<p>My biggest problem at the moment with TechStar is their 5% non-negotiable valuation. I understand they want to keep it simple and totally respect that. But that does not take away the unfairness of things when you give the same valuation to a start-up that is already operating and a start-up that is only an idea. I am sure going forward they will adjust that.<p>-Zaid\n",1174968931

6529,comment,6458,6458,0,0,zach,,,"Anyone who cares, here's a tip.  Go find somewhere that has Yellow Pages listings (and if all else fails your local telco is required by law to sell it to you), and guess what, in its basic form they're not copyrightable.  Address plus name plus phone number, even when combined with a business category, is not original enough to be afforded copyright protection.  So copy them.  I know that's hard to believe because the US has such a low bar for copyrightability, but there have been very specific court cases that I commend to you in order to check it out for yourself.",1174968540

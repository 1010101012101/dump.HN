I've had conversations with numerous homeless people (while waiting for a bus) and all of them had an interesting story to tell (whether it's true or not, that's another issue). 
What really struck me was that every homeless is homeless by his own choice. They have families (which could help them) and money and yet they choose to sleep on the street. I've never had an incident with any of them.<p>One thing I didn't noticed until I moved out is that Tenderloin really teaches you to be humble.

It's neither about ""What would Apple do?"" or ""How could Google leverage this""... unfortunately the truth is much more mundane.<p>The point that I feel is forever-lost on this forum, is that you as a user in your position are statistically unique, there aren't a terrible lot of you versus the great expanse of smart phone users out there. The overwhelming majority of smart phone owners are not interested in any of this in the slightest. Ironically, this is especially even more pronounced on the Android platform due to the penetration tactics that have been engaged(taking the cheap-default-handset crown from Nokia). You see yourself and your peers with the latest Android devices, this creates a false bias that everyone is the same as yourself, but you're actually part of the less than 7% of the Android market that uses the latest Android software. (Many of which can't upgrade even if they wanted to.)<p>This forum presents a group of like minded users who understand ideas like jailbreaking, follow news releases from Google and other tech companies. (Amongst other tech related discussion.)<p>However, what this forum seems to forget is that they represent a fringe user of both the internet and of technology as a whole. You may use the technology subjectively better, but even then you're still just a sliver out there.<p>The bias of being surrounded by people who are technical/brilliant/whatever, whether it's in your technically-minded workplace, your awesome university or the online places you lurk. You are still such a tiny fraction of users. There are more people out there using their smart phones to twitter images of their breakfast than there are forum users here. Even the list of unknown tech start ups dwarfs this forum.<p>The point I'm making, is that you'll have more effect on people by helping them do something incredibly mundane, than you will influence them to change a behaviour for differences that they truly won't notice.<p>About the idea: No one is buying an Apple product because they hate Apple. If the sole reason to jail break the device and install a competing fully-fledged browser is to stick it to Apple, or provide an experience that is available on Android - then you're talking to someone who is already an Android customer, or will be very soon. There is a mistaken idea that iPhones are status-quo grudge purchases, far from it, rather they're quite expensive propositions in comparison to the vast array of cheaper Android devices.",1341215600

Also, the last paragraph of the Background section traditionally explains the problem the invention is addressing.  In this case, it reads,<p>""One significant obstacle to vectorizing loops in program code in existing systems is dependencies between iterations of the loop. For example, loop-carried data dependencies and memory-address aliasing are two such dependencies. These dependencies can be identified by a compiler during the compiler's static analysis of program code, but they cannot be completely resolved until runtime data is available. Thus, because the compiler cannot conclusively determine that runtime dependencies will not be encountered, the compiler cannot vectorize the loop. Hence, because existing systems require that the compiler determine the extent of available parallelism during compilation, relatively little code can be vectorized.""<p>So the claim here is that this problem can't be solved just by the compiler, and wasn't solved by any existing systems at the time of the application.",1341214286

Banks suck at software development; developers suck at finance.  By separating the concerns, you can do regulatory arbitrage as well as focus on your strengths.  (this isn't my idea; I think Ian Grigg of Systemics came up with it in the early 1990s, if not earlier).  Fully separate arms-length entities, different people, not the e-gold ""offshore, really"" approach.  You could create a fully anonymous bearer blinded token infrastructure as software, and then have servers for it, where some of the currencies were entirely non-financial and thus non-regulated (distributed locking mechanism for distributed software systems, resource allocation, anti-spam credibility systems, game currencies), and others which were financial currencies issued by real, established financial institutions with KYC (a dollar currency, shares, futures, ...).  Same software, so the developers have no legal risks themselves.<p>Luxembourg also works, if you have $3-5mm or so to meet the requirements to issue (at least, that's what it would have cost in the late 1990s when I last looked; you need some connections, but they come with having money and hiring people from the industry).  Switzerland and possibly Liechtenstein may work.  I'd skip dodgy ee or south pacific places (e.g. Vanuatu, Narau) since correspondent banking relationships would be trivial to sever.<p>If you were totally focused on gambling (""gaming""), some crown colonies (IoM, Gibraltar) might work, or Panama.<p>You could do it in the USA if you met KYC and also treated it as a commodities trading system, regulated under CFTC.  You can become a CFTC exchange (like Chicago) for $5-10mm.  I'd probably actually do the operations for that in Chicago just to be totally known to all the local regulators, although NYC or SF would also be possible.<p>The thing I absolutely wouldn't do is try to run a payment system which is at all anonymous in the US, and if I did a payment system in the US, it would meet all KYC and MTB requirements.  That puts your capitalization required at a few million dollars more than otherwise, but it's not a big deal.",1341214262

Any casual observer won't even realise that the user is engaging Siri, let alone talking to a robot.<p>This is also part of the problem with the ""accuracy"" studies of Siri in public places.

Likely a lot of exaggeration, some straight bullshit and a little bit of truth.<p>Great story though. And kudos to dropping a c-note on him. Giving a lot to them rarely is far better than $2 here and there, which will likely just go to beer or a small meal. $100 they can actually do something important with.",1341212998

4187707,comment,4187690,4187690,1,0,ricardobeat,,,"This is a simple misconception: .bind() doesn't affect the original function in any way, it just <i>returns a new function</i> that is bound to the argument. If you just keep in mind that .bind <i>creates</i> functions, as per the method documentation, you won't have any trouble:<p><pre><code>    Creates a new function that when called, itself calls
    this function in the context of the provided `this` value [1]
</code></pre>
In the Editable example, the problem is not even bind()'s fault. Even if you used the original, unbound functions for the events, replacing them later wouldn't change the event handlers... what you'd need to respect the prototype chain is to call the object's method inside the handler:<p><pre><code>    this.$reset.click(function(){
        this.reset()
    }.bind(this))

    //or

    var self = this
    this.$reset.click(function(){
        self.reset()
    })
</code></pre>

4187691,comment,4186373,4186737,3,0,culturestate,,,"> Take a look at prices for electronics in Asia, for example. In the very places where the electronics are made, the retail prices are all significantly higher than those in the US. Samsung and LG TVs cost more in Korea than they do in America. Computers cost more in China than they do in the USA. I frequently found myself waiting until I returned to US soil before I made any big ticket electronic or computer purchases, because the savings were ridiculous.<p>On this point, it's important to note that the price disparity is largely due to the way items are taxed in Asia. South Korea has both VAT and a luxury item tax; China has a luxury tax on foreign brands. You need only look to Hong Kong, which has the cheapest prices in the world on e.g. Apple products (because you need a microscope to find a tax in Hong Kong) to break down this model. Your main point re: currency manipulation, especially in China, is still valid and important, but this is a bad example.",1341212482

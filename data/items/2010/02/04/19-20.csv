1101435,comment,1099229,1100316,0,0,pyre,,,"> <i>It's especially visible in the world of package management software. Nearly all come as a package: their own format, their own repos, their own scripts, and the command-line interface. I still don't understand why there's neither single packages' format, nor scripts cannot be reused, and everyone reinvents the wheel on daily basis.</i><p>People aren't 'reinventing' the wheel constantly. There are only two major package management structures (deb/rpm) and there are even tools to translate between them, IIRC. Why 'their own repos?' Because if they make design decisions that are incompatible with the current repository, they have to host their own. It's not like Ubuntu and Debian are mutually exclusive as far as repositories go. Ubuntu pulls over a 'snapshot' of Debian's unstable repository, applying patches where they need to and/or see fit. There are probably plenty of packages in Ubuntu that are unchanged from what they were in the Debian Unstable repository.<p>I'm sure it's the same with Ubuntu-based distros like Mint. They probably pull over a snapshot of the Ubuntu repos, make their modifications and it becomes their next revision of Mint.<p>> <i>Bazaar</i><p>Bzr has its own set of headaches. I haven't used it extensively, but IIRC they use revision numbers on commits that are only valid locally, which I think is a big no-no. Especially with people coming from other version control systems that use the revision number as the canonical pointer to a specific revision.",1265313534

One could say ""Ruby allows for the creation of real Domain Specific Languages and the real extension of Ruby for a given problem domain,"" with only a slight alteration in what one considers ""real"".  As such, saying something like ""Ruby doesn't give you <i>real</i> foo"" doesn't tell anyone anything about what CL gives you that Ruby doesn't.<p>Also . . . I totally understand the desire to keep (non-earth-shattering) performance differences out of the discussion.  After all, one doesn't use Ruby to write realtime systems in the first place.  The performance of its implementations is simply not impressive.  If I've chosen to use Ruby for something, I've already thought about the performance implications and decided that the performance penalties of Ruby as compared with something like C (or even Perl) are not limiting factors for the particular task I choose to tackle.  As such, it makes sense to say ""Please tell me about the syntactic and semantic value of Lisp macros, rather than the performance benefits of a Lisp implementation over a Ruby implementation.""<p>You did, however, get into a little more explanation this time, which is good.

For example, one of the assignments I saw was ""testicle1"", which I doubt you put in, and may put off potential users. Instead of controlling for that sort of input, I'd just have a default recurring demo screen that is editable but not saveable, and gets destroyed once you end your demo session.",1265310806

I know the first time I hit the nested comment delay it really ticked me off.<p>Quite frankly, it still does. The argument goes that a deeply nested comment must be less useful for the entire board and also highly emotional for those involved. Consequently the system, knowing more than you do and having an obligation to the community at large, gives you a ""time out"" period to rethink your reply.<p>Perhaps this assumption is true 90% of the time. The other 10% the two parties are getting to some really interesting bits of self-awareness and compromise. These are things that boards don't usually have and things that benefit the community as a whole greatly. Throwing that out because of the other examples doesn't make any sense at all to me.<p>This entire idea of twiddling with the behavior until HN is less and less intuitive is exactly opposite to what every UI book I've ever read says is a good idea.

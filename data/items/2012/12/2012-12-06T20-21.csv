4883761,comment,4882828,4882828,1,0,jack-r-abbit,,,"I had been thinking about getting a SodaStream for a while now since I drink a fair amount of the Safeway Refreshe brand flavored ""fizzy waters"". But I didn't realize the machine used a proprietary bottle. I usually buy mine in the 4-packs since it is actually cheaper oz-for-oz than the larger single bottles. But I like to take a few 4-packs to work and drink them throughout the day/week. When I'm running low, I bring in another stock. I don't like the idea of always bringing the empty SodaStream bottle(s) home to refill and take back to work the next day. So I'd probably need a dozen or so of their bottles just for work. And while it may be wasteful, I also have the convenience of taking a bottle where I'm going and then just tossing it when I'm done rather than lugging it around until I get home. And if the SodaStream flavors are garbage then I have less desire to get one.<p>With the SodaStream, I envisioned being able to take the bottles I <i>do</i> buy (and didn't toss) and reuse them for the SoadStream... always knowing that if I wanted to, I didn't have to keep track of the refilled bottle when I was done. Maybe I'm lazy or selfish for not wanting to keep track of an empty, reusable bottle... so be it. But I like the convenience of the option to toss the bottle when I'm done.<p>I also wish the article had some numbers on life expectancy of the machine. Its all fine and dandy to accept the reality of needing 4yrs for the machine to pay for itself... until you discover that it failed before then.<p>Based on my expected use pattern (both refilling AND buying new) I doubt my machine would last long enough to break even.",1354827491

If you're truly working from first principles, then you ought to understand the difference between a theoretical and an acceptable solution.<p>I'd say that in the context of software, ""smart and gets things done"" is at a minimum someone with a solid ability to extrapolate from first principles coupled with the ability to problem solve and think critically about what is is they're actually building.  Experience helps tons on that front, but it's no better an indicator of future success than grasping first principles.",1354827483

Samsung is eating away a big chunk of Apple's _profits_.  If they don't address the 2 main issues (imho, people are voting with their money for bigger screens and different/more exciting OS UX), iphone's market share is going to go under 20% soon.  Both are tough issues to crack.  Are they going to come out with a 4.5 - 5"" screen to address that market?  How?  Double retina?  For different OS UX, it always carries risk of alienating current user base.  Really curious if and how they address these issues.",1354827438

In reality, the main reason a BS in Physics even exists is to teach you how to learn so you're prepared when you get to graduate school to work on new problems people haven't had to face before.<p>The unfortunate thing is that corporate american tends to highly undervalue the BS in Physics. While I graduated at the worst time possible time (2008/2009), it took me over a year and a half to find a ""real"" job.  No, I didn't have two + years experience in developing with .Net. I did have 4 years of experience in everything from LabView to Verilog, photomultiplier tube calibration and particle detector design to advanced electrodynamics to CADD and machining, and all the calculus and linear algebra necessary to get there.<p>As someone who was perpetually frustrated by a lack of consideration when applying to jobs, I'd just like to recommend that anyone reading this comment to always consider a candidate with a background in the hard sciences, even if they don't have the relevant experience.",1354827356

Problem with that is that external factors (oil prices, failed harvests, earthquakes in Japan) can cause correlated price changes, too. Correlation of price changes between some major competitors while some other players do not follow suit might be an indicator, but those other competitors might just be in a slightly different situation (other manufacturing method or other company structure (e.g. if one of them owns a mine or has a long-term contract, price changes would affect them differently))<p>In the end, it is really hard to detect cartels.

While these implants are marvelous, they are still pretty crude in the stimulation portion.<p>The implant has an electrode array that is shoved into the cochlea.  In diagrams of the ear, the cochlea is the thing that looks like a snail shell.<p>The cochlea itself wraps around the auditory nerve, and normally works with the auditory nerve as a pressure transducer.  Pressure changes in the cochlea result in nerve stimulation.<p>Different frequencies of sound can propagate to different lengths of the cochlea and stimulate the nerves in the respective areas. You can think of the nerve bundle as a piano keyboard wrapped in a spiral.  Different frequencies correspond to different positions. So having a bunch of electrodes matters for granularity, but positioning in the cochlea is just as important.<p>With the implants though, they don't try to stimulate via pressure, they just send electrical impulses through the electrodes.  The resulting electric field is what stimulates the nerve.<p>So it's pretty different from normal functions.",1354826754

The reason it's so good is because of the properties of executable code: namely that it's fast, precise and repeatable. Human-based QA processes also have their advantages, and if you had unlimited human QA resources then the value of automated testing would be significantly (though not entirely) diminished.<p>But in the end, testability is ancillary, it's a second-order concern to the actual operation of the software.  The ability to write a good test is secondary to the ability (and wisdom!) to choose the right architecture.  In other words, a simple and correct program using some advanced techniques in, let's say Haskell, would be preferable to a kludgy Frankenstein beast of a program written in Ruby but with great test coverage over the areas of the problem domain that the programmer was aware of.<p>Obviously that's a straw man; automated testing is an extremely powerful technique, one which requires practice to master, and TDD shines in its ability to lift the scales from the eyes of the beginning programmer and see programming from a new perspective.  However TDD, BDD et al are no silver bullet and no different from learning functional progamming, gdb, printlining, modular programming, meta programming, dynamic programming, regular expressions, or any other algorithm or technique.

People who don't understand that there is no difference in the harm that can be caused by de facto and de jure governments when they go bad.<p>But if you allow public roads and a public police force, why not public schools? Why not public universities, or public parks? Why not publicly financed scientific research? The answer to any of these questions is, at bottom, ""because that program is better or worse than allowing private enterprise to handle it."" But you have to answer that question on a case by case basis -- and it changes with demographics and technology and everything else.<p>And of course, you have to throw in the nature of coalition politics. Publicly funded universities are an extremely valuable program for college-aged voters and those with college-aged children, but seen as a complete waste of money by childless retirees. So sure, you have to build a coalition, but the existing parties exist as they do only by historical happenstance.<p>What could be interesting it to start a party with the following principles: First, for any given issue, evaluate what the majority of the population would want. Then, evaluate whether that position is manifestly unjust or based on assumptions contrary to the evidence. If not, adopt it as the party's position. Repeat for all issues.<p>Take the platform that party puts out, it's pretty much guaranteed to win a majority of the votes by definition. Then the other party can try to pick off a group of minority positions to form an opposing coalition, but any success they have is liable to just change the majority's view on that particular issue -- which changes the first party's position on it going forward from the date of the next election. And if you want to change policy, get on your soap box and convince the majority, which will chance the party's position.<p>It's kind of like direct democracy, but with a filter for extremely bad ideas.",1354825716

But when out of context, it won't.  If anything, one could argue that if your comment does provide any value toward improving HN, then the article served a greater purpose, and as a result, was of value.<p>Regardless, actions speak louder than words.<p>> All I'm saying is that in the time I've been visiting HN, the information value of the articles upvoted on HN is going down.<p>That's the natural state of things.  I've seen people say this for years now.  It's a reoccurring theme.  I do not know how long you've been visiting HN, but going just by your profile, I can assure you, 444 days ago, people were discussing how HN had gone down hill.<p>I believe a portion of that complaint is that when you first get here, it's new, and you haven't seen the articles being presented.  After a while, you start to read the same thing over and over again.  It becomes dull.  And things start to stand out that you might not have noticed your first day.<p>> You are twisting my words.<p>No.  It's just a misunderstanding.  No twisting was intended.<p>> You say 'people enjoy different things' as if that justifies anything that gets posted on HN.<p>Actually, it does.  HN is based on voting, and the members of HN enjoy reading many types of articles here.  If something gets voted up, it's because a segment of the members want to read these types of things on HN.  That you are uninterested in this specific topic does not mean it's outside of HN's accepted role.<p>> Lots of people enjoy reading about ponies, but you don't see a lot of articles about ponies on HN, and I don't think many people think that's a bad thing.<p>Don't be silly, the context is HN, making that point moot.  The argument isn't about general wants and desires, but what people want to read here on HN.<p>Anyways, my point is, and was, you can either be a part of the problem, or part of the solution.  If you want to see different articles, submit them!  Ignore the ones that you aren't interested in.  Flag articles that don't belong.  You can either be a positive force, or a negative one.",1354824619

6560213,comment,6553794,6558571,2,0,DannyBee,,,"&quot;To respond to your comments in this post, the asm.js validator is not checking for undefined behavior.&quot;<p>So let&#x27;s start simple:<p>asm.js&#x27;s validator does in fact, statically try to decide asm.js spec conformance.  That means it is checking for undefined behavior, since it is checking whether the program meets the language specification, and the language spec disallows various undefined behavior.  I&#x27;m not sure how you could characterize it as anything else, when  the spec itself says this is what it does:<p>&quot;This sublanguage effectively describes a safe virtual machine for memory-unsafe languages like C or C++. A combination of static and dynamic validation allows JavaScript engines to employ an ahead-of-time (AOT) optimizing compilation strategy for valid asm.js code.&quot;<p>Note: it says it uses static and dynamic checking to validate spec conformance.    It also claims it is <i>safe</i>.   Such claims and static program validation of any sufficiently complex language, like asm.js, involves decidability issues and issues about undefined behavior.  Period.  If you disbelieve this, all I can suggest is delving into the field of program validation and static analysis.  I completely understand the cases it cannot validate fall back to normal javascript engine execution, but that actually changes exactly nothing about what the validation is doing, the language specification, undefined behavior, whether it has fundamental limitations, etc.<p>&quot;You have misunderstood how asm.js works, you have misunderstood other people&#x27;s comments, and you have mischaractarized LLVM in other posts here. &quot;<p>I disagree that I have done anything of the sort. \nStarting from the last, I have not mischaracterized LLVM in any way.<p>What I see here is a discussion with people who are trying to make very imprecise comments about very precise technical specifications and definitions, and then argue about them.  I feel like i&#x27;m trying to argue physics with a bunch of chemists.  It&#x27;s not that they aren&#x27;t smart, it&#x27;s that they are abusing terminology and trying to make nonsense out of very well understood issues in the field.<p>In fact, i don&#x27;t believe <i>anyone</i> working in the compiler field (even on asm.js) would disagree with anything i&#x27;ve said, because as far as I can tell, they understand these are all issues, and try to stay away from ridiculous claims about competitors.<p>pcwalton originally made some very direct claims about LLVM&#x27;s IR, and asm.js.  I have pointed out they are directly false. That is not mischaracterizing LLVM, or asm.js.  It is in fact, a response to such mischaracterizations.   Out of kindness, I did not originally point out that a very trivial reading of <i>any</i> paper on LLVM, it&#x27;s bitcode, or the IR, would have shown that his claims are false, and instead responded directly.  The very first LLVM paper ever written even covers <i>exactly the claim he makes about portability, platform independence, and specificity</i>.  He would not have had to look very far on the website to find a refutation.<p>I actually have no real love for either (they are both a set of engineering tradeoffs).  I just cannot stand to see one side or the other pretend that the other side is completely horrible, and that they have chosen &quot;the one true path&quot;.   I am also not going to watch one side or the other make claims that are simply false in an attempt to support that path.<p>In any case, i&#x27;m not going to argue about it anymore here, as it is a mild exercise in futility.  You are welcome to believe what you like about asm.js and LLVM, and their relative merits.",1381937624

This is where the fruits of the increased automation will be seen first.<p>I can accept this theory. Personally, I believe we&#x27;ll eventually get to a point where the economy will have to do a dramatic shift in the direction of greater taxation of the richest and more leisure time for most people (&quot;most work is automated&quot;), but we might not be close to that point yet.

Business model - in the future the $ comes from dealers and additional functionality (stores/featured auctions) not present on the site.<p>2. Traditionally the collectibles markets are tough because while you can supposedly sell something for $xyz, you&#x27;ll need to actually find a buyer willing to pay that. Many items are worth a lot of cash but end up selling for next to nothing because collectors are very specific. What we&#x27;re doing is basically a reverse-marketplace on the back end. Users say what they want and then dealers get a feed of the most &quot;wantlisted&quot; items and compete for the bounty of filling those wants. All marketplaces have to solve the chicken and the egg problem (as you went on to note re: buyers and sellers both needed) -- this is our attempt at overcoming it for both sides. There is incentive for sellers, as they&#x27;ll get a near instant sale. There is incentive for buyers to stick around as they just add something to their wantlist and get a near instant offer.

Children in Mexico would pick up a stink bug and eat it raw, a sour-crunchy snack.  In Southeast Asia there&#x27;s a large beetle about the size of a Snickers bar that in fact tastes like a Snickers bar.  In Africa some folks like to eat large termites, a high protein food source.  In Australia, there&#x27;s a type of grub that lives in the roots of certain bushes that aborigines will cut open and eat.  In Japan there are some &quot;interesting&quot; dishes.<p>I&#x27;ve tried grasshoppers, sold in tiny packets, salted and spiced to the point where you only taste the spice and salt.  Bear Ghrylls demonstrated eating ants as a survival technique (remove the head first).<p>Insects are superior to meat in many ways--low fat, high quality protein and other nutrients, low on the food chain so they contain fewer toxins which tend to accumulate in herbivores and even more in carnivores.<p>You can harvest grasshoppers in the wild using nets.  Just be careful that they haven&#x27;t been chewing on poison ivy or other toxic plants which may do you harm.<p>I&#x27;ve long had it in mind to start an insect food business and this article was rather inspiring.  This guy just started a cockroach farm and is making money.<p>It may sound disgusting to us squeamish Westerners, yet think about the notion of eating a pig or a cow, higher mammals which are fairly intelligent, creatures who exhibit emotions, who dream, who are evolutionarily our second cousins when compared to insects.<p>Just don&#x27;t eat dragonflies (a popular skewered dish in a part of Indonesia).

The concept of sushi was once considered exotic and borderline repugnant in the US, and now it&#x27;s a lunchtime staple. To that effect, I could see the rebranding of the roach beginning at the high end of the market, rather than the bottom. Fancy restaurateurs will experiment with them, perhaps as much for shock value as for culinary effect. This will start a trend, and pretty soon, they&#x27;ll be the hot new thing at hipster food trucks, expensive gastropubs, and boutique coffee shops.<p>Then again, maybe not. People have been trying to make insect-based cuisine happen in the US for many years now, and it&#x27;s been very slow to attract any real attention or adoption. The humble cockroach probably suffers from the worst stigmatization of all the insects, though. So it&#x27;s got a tough path to navigate to respectability. Others will probably have to pave the way before the roach can gain any appeal. Crickets, which are <i>very</i> closely related and can be a similar domestic nuisance, strike people as cute and charming for whatever reason (these people probably haven&#x27;t seen the bigger ones). They will probably come first.",1381935783

Not entirely for their content but I like seeing 1) the kinds of people going through YC at the moment, 2) their company, 3) how their company is doing at the moment. Also I think these articles are helpful in showing people that the YC application process is a no bullshit process.

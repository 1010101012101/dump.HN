3341058,comment,3339236,3339236,5,0,gruseom,,,"There's a lot of discussion in this thread around ""junior"" vs. ""senior"". This misses the point, which is to hire good programmers and avoid bad ones. It's as if the industry has finally burned itself out of the ""programmers as replaceable cogs"" model and has replaced it with the next-laziest model, ""hire senior, not junior"". That is an improvement, but it's still so off-base that the words ""junior"" and ""senior"" applied to programming make me cringe.<p>Here are two factors the junior/senior model does not take into account. First, a good but inexperienced programmer will learn so quickly that they will run rings around mediocre experienced programmers in no time. Second, experience isn't only a good thing. Once people have repeated something a certain way enough times (and surprisingly few repetitions are required), they become locked-in and unable to see alternatives. This loss of flexibility is toxic to effective programming.<p>Of course that happens less to good programmers than bad ones, but that only puts us back at the real question - how do you tell a good one apart from a bad one? - something we have no satisfactory way of answering that is compatible with current hiring practices.<p>What we need is a healthy culture of interaction between ""junior"" and ""senior"". Our industry lacks this. What is our path to learning?  We have the sink-or-swim model in which people once hired are installed in a silo and told to work on their tasks. Everyone recapitulates all the classic mistakes and has to figure everything out for themselves. I know I did. It cost me at least 5 years developmentally, and I'm only putting the number that low to save face. This way is so inefficient that it must eventually yield to something better. Hopefully when that happens there will also be less of the prickly auto-didact about most of us - but that's another story.",1323637133

What does ""file sharing"" mean to you (could SkyDrive do it, or cloud-based SharePoint)? Speaking of SharePoint, have you considered Office 365?<p>I know it's fashionable to do everything in the cloud these days, but my personal preference is to have control over my digital assets, so I like to keep everything(!) in-house. For 20-50 -strong team, AD/Exchange/SharePoint/ForeFront setup would be mostly accepting defaults (2), and keeping everything running won't take much effort.<p>1). An AD is not neccessarily a bad thing. You could create accounts locally and push them into Office 365 automatically (ditto for Exchange accounts). You could use DirectAccess to meet the remote use requirement, although someone who knows more about the Linux/Mac world would need to comment on whether that will with DirectAccess.<p>2).

I'm a little older and a little greyer than the poster boy rockstar-ninja founder and I have far more important things in my life than work. This doesn't mean I don't work hard, but it does mean I'm not sacrificing the things most precious to me for a web app. Paradoxically this could mean I need to work much harder within my constraints and I'm fine with that.<p>I have a few thoughts on how I could go about this - and they are only ill-defined thoughts at the moment, but I would be much obliged for any input this community has to offer.<p>Ideally I'd like to work with others on this. I've tried the sole founder thing before but I miss having people to bounce ideas off, share the workload, share the spoils or just without them knowing it, getting me through one of the dark days that are bound to come along.<p>I'd want to split things as evenly as possibly, skewed just enough in favour of the person who is best to guide things along (this doesn't even necessarily have to be myself, though I don't foresee it not being). When money comes in, we each take our split. With a little luck we've all got some walking around money without any of the burn-out inducing hours and load that can happen.<p>Which brings me onto my next thought: time. I see this as being a part-time venture in terms of the hours put in. We all work say 16 hours/week - as much as possible on a schedule convenient to that person. I haven't thought out the exact number too much yet but I think 16 is low enough to fit comfortably around a fulltime job, yet enough to get things done if there are at least a couple of us.<p>This isn't something to make you rich beyond the dreams of avarice, but with a bit of luck and a bit of time, maybe it will be provide a nice little income. Maybe one day it will turn into something worth going full time at (and compensated accordingly of course). If it all blows up, then fine, we go our seperate ways and hopefully everyone had a good time, at least got a little money out of it and can still go back to the day job.<p>Like I said, these are still-forming thoughts at the moment and I'm sure there are huge holes to be torn in my thinking but I do believe that somewhere in here is a system that can be made to work. It won't be for everyone, but your traditional startup isn't for me so I'd rather have likeminded folks on this anyway.<p>I may still be a little drunk from last night but I'm a long-time member of this site (even if I'm cowardly hiding behind a throwaway) and I value the insights I know a lot of you can offer.<p>Have at me! :)",1323635829

It's not the really legend they are chasing, for the most part.  Men are competitive, driven to be successful, make lots of money, and driven to take risks because women reward decisive, winning, wealthy, successful risk-taking men with more attention than losers and boring, predictable guys.  This drive to succeed is partly biological (higher testosterone, for example) and partly social conditioning reinforced by the behavior of the women they have known in their life.<p>In contrast, men aren't especially attracted to success.  It's not unattractive, but they care more about beauty and personality.  Most women know this, which is probably one reason why people turn to outside ""empowerment"" and other paternalistic encouragement and positive reinforcement to affect female behavior.  Meanwhile, women are choosing fields and careers that interest them, like psychology, biology, and education, or that will result in a high-status profession like law or medicine.<p>Despite rhetoric to the contrary, evidence points to women caring about male attention and caring about having children and a family.<p><i>[women] are also capable of building...</i><p>I think that by now it is more or less conclusively proven that women are <i>capable</i> of a great deal.

In other words, it comes at the cost of productivity.<p>So, even if sharding is not easy, you can do quite a lot of it in the time you save by not having to code around the limitations of most noSQL DBMS.<p>The day will come when RDBMS are secret productivity weapon of smaller companies that don't feel they have to act like they were Google.<p>That said, there are very good reasons not to use RDBMS in cases where the data model or specific access patterns just don't fit. But in most of those cases, I find that using in memory data structures combined with file system storage or something like BerkeleyDB is a much better fit than any server based DBMS.",1323634991

3340951,comment,3340497,3340691,12,0,sipefree,,,"Ad hominem attacks aside, let me address your points.<p>Firstly, destruction upon leaving scope in Objective-C would add some magic unexpected behavior that doesn't conform to what we expect from standard C stack-based functions.<p>In C++, when an object is normally declared, it exists on the stack, therefore it will disappear when the scope ends. The fact that the destructor is called is nice.<p>In Objective-C, all objects exist solely on the heap. All object-orientation is done at runtime, not at compile time, which leaves it open to be a lot more dynamic and open to fiddling at run time than C++ is. This of course loses a lot of the speed that C++ has, but it's not a big deal in most standard applications.<p>Since creating an object requires specifically allocating it on the heap, having it destruct when the pointer leaves scope is no good. That kind of magic behavior is exactly what would lead to awful bugs in Obj-C. If you want short-lived objects, you call their autoreleased constructors, which means they will self-destruct next time the thread's event loop ticks. It's an extremely common pattern, and happens so often in code that you don't, as you claim, 'have to understand the details of the implementation'.<p>And there's absolutely no need for the derision in your post.

3340926,comment,3339925,3340672,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"It's clear enough what the scientists tried to do with GPS, the southern boundary of Greenland, and the level of the bedrock of the boundary of Greenland.<p>There are amazing images of all of Greenland showing that nearly all of the Greenland bedrock is a big, deep bowl with most of the bowl actually significantly below sea level.  The usual claim is that the ice on Greenland has been so heavy that it has pushed down the bedrock.  'Ats a 'lotsa icea'.<p>However, of course, given that ice is much less dense than rock, there are some issues, but let's set those aside.<p>Yes there are claims that the last ice age pushed down the bedrock over most of Canada and that the bedrock is still slowly rebounding.<p>The problem is the article (the one of this thread, not the article, I have not seen, given at the conference).  The problem with the article of this thread is that it, the article, maybe JUST the ARTICLE, maybe not the scientific work, is just as I wrote succinctly, ""BS"".  The problems with the article are just at the level of middle school data analysis.<p>The simplest criticism of the article is its use of ""as high as"" to try to characterize something about all of the bedrock of the boundary of southern Greenland.<p>The main cause of the problems with the article and the main source of the use of ""as high as"" is the author's approach via the usual of the newsies, drama.  He's looking for drama.  He's following the usual way, concentrate on extremes.  I said this:<p>""Newsies go for drama; for that they like to emphasize the extreme cases, and that is what this author is doing.""<p>For ""as high as"", I wrote:<p>""Moreover, the 'as high as' really means that there could have been just one location with 20 mm with all the other locations less.""<p>In most objective terms, the article is BS because it never really said anything at all meaningful about the level of the bedrock on Greenland; it said nothing, nichts, nil, nada.  Just read the article and read what I wrote; the article said NOTHING.<p>Look, let me put it to you this way:  In the eighth grade there are two classes, A and B. Class A is on one side of the building and class B on the other side.  Someone does an analysis of the heights of the students and finds that some of the students in class A are as much as 2 inches taller than they were last year and, since last year, grew by more than 1 inch more than some of the students in class B. What can we conclude from this, that students in class A grew more than those in class B?  Heck no.  Actually, its quite possible that the same statement would also be true with A and B interchanged.<p>What the article reported about the bedrock level is no better than this total BS about classes A and B.<p>In particular, the author never said anything to let us draw his conclusion that the bedrock in southern Greenland rose unusually quickly in year 2010.<p>Again, again, yet again, once again, the article reported the data on the bedrock levels so badly that it said nothing, nothing at all, nichts, nil, nada, about bedrock level changes.  NOTHING.  To see this, just read the F'g article or my post.<p>Again, over again, to explain clearly, once again, the problem was that the author went for drama instead of meaningful data analysis.  DRAMA.  He wanted drama.  He wanted to grab people by the heart and the gut.  It was emotion, all emotion, in this case totally meaningless emotion, and not reason, not even one gram of reason.<p>Again, the problem is at the level of middle school.<p>What might the article have done?  How about:<p>""In year 2005, some high quality GPS receivers were placed at 30 locations scattered around the boundary of Greenland.<p>At each location, the altitude of the receiver at that location was noted in September of year 2005.<p>The following table shows the change in altitude (in mm) for each of the locations in September from the previous September for each of years 2006, 2007, ..., 2010.<p>In the next table we show for each year 2006, 2007, ..., 2010 the change averaged across the 20 locations in the southern 2/3rds of Greenland.<p>What we observe from this data is that, for the stations in the southern 2/3rds of Greenland, on average the increase in bedrock altitude was unusually high from September 2009 to September 2010.<p>A conjecture is that the cause of the unusually high increase is greater ice loss from higher temperatures from September, 2009 to September 2010.""<p>But what is in the article is NOTHING like that, not similar, not the same, not nearly the same, etc.<p>Again, maybe there was some good data collection, but what the article wrote about the data is BS.<p>Why the drama?  First, the media just wants to keep following their old business model of emphasizing drama.  Second, in particular, because a big theme in the media is to ride a wave, mostly generated by and heavily reinforced by, the media, to have a 'story', a continuing 'story', a 'story' really easy to write about, a very dramatic story, about 'global warming' and, now, 'climate change'.  They just sling the BS out there, whether there is good science or bad science, they just sling the BS the same.  Because they want a dramatic 'story'.  And it's all emotionalism with ""as high as"" and never rationalism.  It's BS, and in total it's DANGEROUS.<p>I never mentioned AGW.<p>As I said, I call BS.<p>At C|NET there are claims that the global warming articles and readers posts supporting them are both paid for by organizations that want to convince the public that 'climate change' is a big problem and must be stopped.<p>'Get it' now?",1323634554

So the question of liquid water on Mars informs the probability of life there, no liquid water, lower probability, liquid water, higher probability.<p>Much of the scientific community is on board with the idea that liquid water existed on Mars at 'some' time, and a few are in the 'recently' camp, and a small number are in the 'now' camp.

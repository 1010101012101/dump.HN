Our use case is fairly specific: a customer uploads text documents, often as a spreadsheet originally exported from someone else&#x27;s tool, but doesn&#x27;t think hard about the encodings involved, so in order to serve them well we have to fix whatever happened. Accordingly, we put the most effort into solving problems that happen for our English-centric, US-centric customer base; they&#x27;re the most important problems for us (though Russian has also gotten some love, as you can see from the commit history). On top of that, making Asian language exports from other tools work correctly usually requires enough encoding-awareness to mitigate a bunch of the problem[1], so we see those problems less frequently.<p>That said, if you have examples where ftfy fails in any language, please submit them! We want this tool to work well, because anything that we can&#x27;t fix will cause us to have egg on our faces with a customer someday...<p>[1]No peeking: how many format options in Excel&#x27;s &quot;Save As&quot; dialog, excluding Excel formats, produce a document from which Unicode can be recreated accurately?",1408233296

8188028,comment,8185021,8187967,3,0,rat87,,,"For context<p>> [Hitler] has grasped the falsity of the hedonistic attitude to life. Nearly all western thought since the last war, certainly all &quot;progressive&quot; thought, has assumed tacitly that human beings desire nothing beyond ease, security, and avoidance of pain. In such a view of life there is no room, for instance, for patriotism and the military virtues. The Socialist who finds his children playing with soldiers is usually upset, but he is never able to think of a substitute for the tin soldiers; tin pacifists somehow won’t do. Hitler, because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional strength, knows that human beings don’t only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not to mention drums, flag and loyalty-parades…. Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a grudging way, have said to people &quot;I offer you a good time,&quot; Hitler has said to them &quot;I offer you struggle, danger and death,&quot; and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his feet.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this appeals to people more then peace and prosperity but it can have a strong appeal to some people some of the time especially to young men(see ISIS) and especially when your side is winning the war and civilian losses are low.",1408233005

Basically, they simplified a lot of the tedious bits of 3.5 and removed the weird role concepts. The Basic rules, which come as a PDF, are now available[1]. In general it looks closer to 3 than 4, but is still attempts to remove lots of the table calculation from the game.<p>What this article somewhat mentions and what seems really weird for people that like Pen and Paper and want to play this new edition is that they are releasing the CORE books over the span of a few months. It&#x27;s kind of weird for players. Sure we get the Player&#x27;s handbook this Tuesday, but without a DM book and a Monster Manual it makes things a little limited for a few months.<p>A decent portion of the core audience moved on to Pathfinder and feel pretty comfortable there. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see if this push can sway us back.<p>The key part of course is you don&#x27;t NEED to change. A lot of people still stick to old versions. I play once a month with a group of 5 others. It&#x27;ll take us a couple years just to get through our current campaign in Pathfinder.

8187928,comment,8186701,8187895,1,0,disjointrevelry,,,"> Consumers were victims of power companies that ignored market signals, not a crafty scheme to leverage them out of their money.<p>DC Energy didn&#x27;t exactly go to the power companies and say, &quot;Hey guys, when I bet against your power capacity, it means put more money in it so I can lose my investment!&quot; That&#x27;s just completely absurd.<p>From the article:\n> The contracts were intended to protect the electricity producers, utilities and industries that need to buy power. The thinking was that the contracts would help them hedge against sharp price swings caused by competition as well as the weather, plant failures or equipment problems. Those lower costs could reduce consumers’ bills.<p>> But Wall Street banks and other investors have stepped in, siphoning off much of the money. In New York, DC Energy accounted for more than a quarter of the total $639 million in profits in the congestion markets between 2003 and 2013, The Times found. Some of DC Energy’s biggest paydays involved Port Jefferson, a village 60 miles east of Manhattan. Because of the geography of the grid, moving power from one point to another means demand often briefly outstrips supply here.<p>It&#x27;s exploitation by DC Energy pure and simple. Exploitation is a foundation of Capitalism. What occurred is inadequate protections, whether intentional or not. The lack of a working strategy to protect electric producers is the true &#x27;signal&#x27; that DC Energy conveyed.",1408230809

No evidence that they did.<p>Power company: Has extra money from selling the contract and double incentive to spend that money in a manner that would prevent price differences between Northport and Port Jefferson.<p>----------------------------<p>CMV, but it sounds like the market is doing exactly what it is supposed to be doing. DC Energy placed a bet that others were underestimating the probability of trouble between Northport and Port Jefferson. They created an incentive for other market players (especially power companies) to take action against this possibility and install backup capacity, perform preventative maintenance, or generally to do whatever a power company can do to prevent problems like the one that happened. Since these measures weren&#x27;t taken DC energy now gets their payout for having &quot;told them so.&quot; At least, that&#x27;s how I understand it. If my understanding is correct it seems like everything is on the up-and-up. Consumers were victims of power companies that not only failed to anticipate the problem but didn&#x27;t take the hint when trading firms offered to bet that there <i>would</i> be a problem.<p>The thing that would make this a scandal would be if it were discovered that DC Energy had, say, payed someone at the power company to &quot;pull an Enron&quot; and sabotage maintenance. The danger of this kind of scheme is obviously real (see: the audio clips of Enron traders giggling like kids stealing cookies (yes, really) as they ordered power plants offline in California, driving up prices by creating an artificial shortage that eventually became known as the infamous rolling blackouts). However, it doesn&#x27;t look like there is any evidence that the same conflict of interest is happening here.<p>Is the article arguing that these markets shouldn&#x27;t exist because this kind of behavior would be nearly impossible to detect, making for tremendous moral hazard?

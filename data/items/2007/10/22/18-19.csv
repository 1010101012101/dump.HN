71231,comment,71129,71138,0,0,tritchey,,,"Libraries felt like a problem at the beginning, but in the end have not tended to be an issue for us. So far, we have been able to either find suitable libraries, or use FFI to hook into 3rd party code. At times it seems like we have the kitchen sink in there when you look at the dependencies, but asdf keeps it pretty manageable.<p>The biggest issue we had was with a limitation in SBCL's serve-event implementation. It turns out it uses select, which caused some nasty issues for us when file descriptors climbed over 1024. In our case, we are handling thousands of persistent ssl connections on the back end. We were using epoll to service all of these connections, but the database library clsql was using serve-event. Under certain situations, we would end up handing select an FD > 1024, and things would go all pear-shaped.<p>The fix was to patch serve-event itself to use epoll. It is a pretty rough patch at this point, but it works and keeps us going.<p>The other area we had to punt was with our installer generation. That was as much because we are running our servers on Linux as anything else. We have a special windows server that creates the custom MSI files for each account.<p>Some times the power is a bit too much, as well. While patching a running server with fixes is cool, I will fully admit to a couple gotchas when we thought we were making obvious fixes that turned out to have not-so-obvious repercussions. In those cases, the problem always existed between the keyboard and chair. We do a better job of checking things offline before rolling them out.<p>I know #lisp has a pretty bad reputation, but there are some very smart people that hang out there, and they want to see Common Lisp succeed. In general it is a much saner place than c.l.l.\n",1193079246

71228,comment,71191,71223,0,0,Harj,,,"hey cyggie,<p>thanks for the feedback. to address your points:<p>Scheduling - yes we totally agree scheduling is a critical feature and it's at the top of <a href=""http://features.auctomatic.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://features.auctomatic.com</a> and we'll be working on it asap. We've found that powersellers are still happy to test out the beta and give us really useful feedback without it - that was the purpose of the first beta launch so it's not been a problem.<p>Inventory management - there's nothing tying inventory in the app to eBay specifically.  It just happens that eBay is the first platform we're supporting but we'll be offering multiple channel support as soon as the core ebay product is ready.  We'll also be tying the inventory into a backend accounts package like Quickbooks to provide a one-stop shop system for complete inventory control.<p>Please let me know if there's any other feedback you have - it's exactly to hear this that we launched the beta so it's much appreciated.  If you have specific feature requests please feel free to submit and/or vote at <a href=""http://features.auctomatic.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://features.auctomatic.com</a>\n",1193078453

71223,comment,71191,71191,0,0,cyggie,,,"What they're trying to do sounds great... but I wonder how well they really know their user base...<p>Scheduling: Without basic feature like scheduling, I CAN'T even test them out. Most ""power seller"" sell the same items over and over, so it doesn't matter how much I love the interface, if I have to sit there manually launching the listings myself, it's just not going to work...<p>Inventory management: The idea is nice, but guess what... I'd say 80% of the successful eBay seller will branch out to other platform like amazon & their own site. If you're only monitoring my eBay inventory, it's pretty much pointless... because the idea behind monitoring inventory level for eBay seller is so they don't over list and piss off their buyers, but unless it's synced up with my other selling platform, it's not going to do me any good...<p>",1193077504

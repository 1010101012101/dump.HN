The current response is that GHash is removing processing power, but how is that a good long-term solution? The BTC community should be demanding and supporting technical fixes.<p>Also it&#x27;s too bad that BTC is blinding everyone to a variety of other crypto-currencies that have improved features.",1402725549

Keeping some of the applications was a nice touch in addition to, apparently, announcing some kind of partner program.<p>They should read through the http status code list again though. 404 means that the server is currently unable to find the resource requested. 410 means that the resource is gone and never expected to return.

7892155,comment,7890305,7890862,2,0,davidw,,,"> It&#x27;s also right that JSON contains nothing regarding hypertext within its data type (ignoring JSON-schema) and is therefore a weird choice for the web and REST, where hypertext is fundamental.<p>It&#x27;s easy to consume with Javascript, which is where <i>most</i> JSON probably ends up.<p>Ultimately though, something I&#x27;ve learned over the years is that you can either &quot;go with the flow&quot; and do things the way most people are, or you can try and do things your own way.  Unless you&#x27;re Microsoft or Google or something though, mostly, you don&#x27;t have enough resources to do <i>everything</i> your own way, so you have to strike out on your own only where it really counts.  Erlang does that in a number of places already, for sensible reasons - it&#x27;s part of what makes the language so good at some things.  However, fighting JSON is likely one of those Don Quixote battles that&#x27;s not really going to get you much outside of some very specific contexts.",1402724954

7892137,comment,7890104,7891973,1,0,msandford,,,"&quot;Netflix&#x27;s solution is was to peer and to place a bunch of storage gear at ISP points of presence for free. That works, but may not be a solution that makes sense for the ISP for a variety of reasons.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s the thing.  The ISP is over-subscribed, i.e. they&#x27;ve sold probably 25 more &quot;contracts&quot; for service than they can actually deliver.  They advertise 25/5 Mbps service to customers but allocate perhaps only 1/0.2 Mbps (only 4% of what they&#x27;re advertising for sale) across their back-haul and peering stations for their customers.  This is under the premise that the network is bursty and people download webpages in a second or two and then read them for several minutes, etc.  That assumption might have been valid 10 years ago.  It&#x27;s much less valid today.<p>So the situation isn&#x27;t that Netflix is DDoSing the poor little ISP which is doing it&#x27;s best but just can&#x27;t keep up.  It&#x27;s that the ISP has KNOWINGLY oversold itself and it&#x27;s now getting caught in the act and it&#x27;s wildly pointing fingers at anyone and everyone it can.  And it&#x27;s attempting to re-frame the argument in a fashion that makes them look like the victims when in fact they&#x27;re the villains.<p>In reality what Netflix is doing is bending over backwards to try and make their customers (who also by definition are an ISPs customers) get the level of service that the customer has already paid for and has a very legitimate claim against their ISP for in terms of transport from their house all the way to the ISPs peering stations.  The ISP isn&#x27;t upgrading their peering links unless they get paid to do so.  They are holding their customers hostage and demanding ransom from people who their customers have quite literally already paid to be able to communicate with.<p>I can understand how this can be confusing because the ISPs are doing an AMAZING job of framing the argument in terms that make them look like the victims of horrible abuse.  But that&#x27;s simply not the case.  They signed up for this &quot;abuse&quot; when they advertised certain speeds and started billing customers for it.<p>They&#x27;re basically upset that customers are asking them to make good on their promises because they thought they&#x27;d never have to.  I am sympathetic to their plight in the sense that I know how much it sucks to make a utilization assumption and to price it accordingly and to get it wrong.  But having gotten it wrong in the past doesn&#x27;t make it OK to continue to get it wrong always and forever.<p>EDIT: I just reconciled my 100x, 4% math which didn&#x27;t make any sense.",1402724161

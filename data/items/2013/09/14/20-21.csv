Has been a joy trying to digest all of the facets covered.  In this subthread, it comes back to what is the program trying to accomplish?  Communicating exacting steps to the computer to perform (as few computers will &quot;ignore imperative steps&quot;[1]), or communicating to the next programmer what was intended.  Or both?  Seems we both feel it is both, and hence needs a hybrid approach.<p>[1]  I realize this isn&#x27;t even strictly true.  Computers are free to reorder some instructions, for example.",1379192369

The image can then be updated, tested and deployed (using pxe) when you feel the need.\nAlso, using puppet or chef or even emerge of binary packages (by an in-house built deployment solution), one can install supplemental packages on a running system if needed.\nFrom my experience, having a fully source based Linux system is good for performance, security and - last but not least - stability.",1379192318

One of the good things that it did was divide the standard into a core language, and standard library built on top of the small core language. The core language eliminated many things from R5RS, but the standard library adds a lot more.<p>The main issues I have with R6RS are the library system (which I think is too complex, and it frustratingly adds an extra level of indentation as you need to wrap everything in one big expression), and some of the libraries in the standard library, like the I/O library, the Unicode library (which standardizes on such things as char-upcase and char-downcase, which are fairly useless in a Unicode context, without adding much that&#x27;s actually useful).<p>R6RS is this kind of weird, awkward beast that&#x27;s not sure what it&#x27;s doing.

A couple years ago we thought about doing a product around it, controlling and monitoring access to our wifi in an unobtrusive and (reasonably) privacy- respecting way.<p>Our biggest problem is how engrossing the network is. It competes with homework and invariably wins. The only thing that works for us here are rigid rules that keep the computer unavailable during any time in which it is even possible that they might theoretically have homework that they could have forgotten about.<p>What clearly doesn&#x27;t work is the &quot;net nanny&quot; stuff; it turns you into an (obnoxious) sysadmin for your kids. And, honestly: I don&#x27;t want to know.<p>My general belief here is that the approach that will work here is to create the understanding that Internet usage is watched, that the kids are accountable for how they use it, but that in &quot;the normal course of business&quot; that capability isn&#x27;t used; we don&#x27;t actually want to see their chats or read their history.<p>I won&#x27;t let my kids near Reddit.

Or do you just want to not seem wrong, no matter what arguments are required to accomplish that?<p>When you give a link supporting your views, do you read the link first and check that it supports the argument you&#x27;re making? Because it seems like you&#x27;re not doing that.<p>In this case, the link you gave says that using the &quot;new estimate method&quot;, there were 1 billion hungry people in 1990-92 (out of a world population of 5.370 billion) and there were 870 million hungry in 2013 (out of a population of 7.095 billion). So world hunger didn&#x27;t just decrease as a percentage of population (from 18% to 12.3%), it decreased as an ABSOLUTE NUMBER. As the population went up, the total NUMBER of starving people DECLINED.<p>Your link also says this:<p>> <i>&quot;The world produces enough food to feed everyone. World agriculture produces 17 percent more calories per person today than it did 30 years ago, despite a 70 percent population increase. This is enough to provide everyone in the world with at least 2,720 kilocalories (kcal) per person per day&quot;</i><p>So as you said, a bit snottily, &quot;We already can&#x27;t feed our present numbers, or haven&#x27;t you been paying attention?&quot;, the link you provide in &quot;support&quot; actually said we CAN feed our present numbers and also says we&#x27;re getting ever-better at actually doing so.<p>In short, your link does not in any way support your argument. So the &quot;environmental deniers&quot; you refer to are probably correct; you are wrong. As this is starting to seem like a trend, you might want to re-evaluate your information sources; they are not serving you well.<p>Here&#x27;s a useful tip: most people are not complete idiots. If your sources give you the impression that everybody in some huge ideological grouping (say &quot;environmental deniers&quot;, or even &quot;climate deniers&quot;) IS a complete idiot, then they might not be showing you the whole picture. Try to seek out the MOST credible arguments against your position - and strengthen them if you can. Don&#x27;t just harp on the relatively few stupid people making stupid, easily debunked arguments and assume that the opposite of what they believe must be true - &quot;reversed stupidity is not intelligence&quot;. Give the other side some benefit of the doubt.

But that isn&#x27;t an inherent feature of the system, and the opposite can also happen. Coalition politics can pull the government towards a fringe when they rely on a fringe party to reach a majority.<p>This can happen, for example, when the two main blocs (center-right / center-left) each get around 40%, and then the far-left and far-right each get ~10%. One solution in that case is a left-right unity government with 80%. But another one is a left or a right government with barely over 50%, in which the extreme party holds the balance of power. Since the government depends on the extreme party to stay in power, that party is able to extract some concessions that are not desired by the centrist part of the electorate, and which they would not likely have been able to get outside of the coalition horse-trading process.<p>An example of this happening was the 2001-2011 right-wing government in Denmark. The coalition was made up of the traditional center-right parties, together with the anti-immigrant populist movement, Dansk Folkeparti. Since the coalition could not afford to lose DF&#x27;s ~12% vote, they ended up reluctantly agreeing to a number of anti-immigrant policies that would not otherwise have been passed.",1379191042

Also, existing programs like Medicaid have maintained the same level of service even as costs spiral out of control.<p>The <i>only</i> thing I can think of that&#x27;s actually been cut is AFDC, if you consider a time limit on benefits to be a cut.  And that&#x27;s perfectly reasonable - it&#x27;s supposed to be a net, not a hammock.<p>Also, if you really wanted to trap people in poverty you couldn&#x27;t do better than to hand them money for being poor.  Lots of people are on benefits for a few years and then they pull themselves out of poverty.  But there&#x27;s a significant percentage who&#x27;ll stay on benefits because that&#x27;s the path of least resistance.<p>> Tax liens sold to rich investors lets them practically steal homes (or get them at bargain prices) and evict the owners in order to flip them off what are sometimes ridiculously small amounts of debt compared to the home value owed by the not-well-off (but not ridiculously small compared to their financial situation).<p>I&#x27;m not sure you understand how this works.  When you have a lien against your house and you don&#x27;t pay it, the lien holder can force the sale of the property.  But the homeowner gets the money from the sale after the lien has been satisfied.<p>Nobody&#x27;s getting screwed here.  People who end up with no money 1) didn&#x27;t pay their taxes and 2) don&#x27;t have any equity in the house.<p>If you didn&#x27;t have a system where the city/county could take your house for back taxes nobody would pay taxes.",1379190061

Did your parents know? Were the next n years of your life composed of, in part, hiding that fact from your parents? I found a porn mag in the park once when I was maybe 9 and the next several years of my life were filled with confusion and stifled curiosity.<p>Being that I&#x27;m Indian my parents did not want to even think that I would ever want to know anything about women until age 30, when they would marry me to one of their friends&#x27; daughters just after we both finished our residencies. They thought that through denial and obstinance they could force the world to be a nice, pleasant reality. The only thing they communicated to me is that they were unable to help me with any of my &quot;real&quot; problems so I would have to seek answers elsewhere.<p>So to me, <i>not</i> having a frank discussion about what exactly the Internet has in store for naively inquisitive minds, including a journey through the perverted forest of cocks that is chatroulette, seems like a decision that serves you more than it serves your kids.

That&#x27;s how most people talk about responsibility.<p>However, if you are reacting to past associations with rewards and punishments, you are not being response-able. Being responsible doesn&#x27;t mean, &quot;I am going to be a responsible adult,&quot; as in, &quot;I am fulfilling this socially-conditioned image of an &#x27;adult&#x27;.&quot; Responsibility means being able to make choices (whether they are informed, or not, wise or foolish, it does not matter; there is no such thing as a &quot;responsible choice&quot;), then accepting <i>all</i> the consequences of each choice. It&#x27;s only when you accept what is, is, are you <i>able</i> to <i>respond</i> with more choices and actions. People tend to want to make choices, yet avoid accepting the unexpected or undesirable outcomes of those choice. By avoiding or deluding themselves into thinking the undesirable did not happen, they compound avoidance with more avoidance until they are paralyzed, unable to act. They are unable to respond.<p>Sometimes, to avoid a trap, you have to let things go. You let go of what seems to be urgent, <i>accept the consequence of letting go of the urgent</i>, in order to make room to climb out of the trap. Or to use a more concrete metaphor: if your foot is caught in a bear trap, and the bear is coming after you, and you don&#x27;t want to be eaten, then chop off your foot. (That or just sit down and die with dignity).<p>Yes. It sucks. Yes, it will hurt. Yes, you might still die of infections, bleeding out, or get chased down by the bear. Or maybe the bear gets distracted by the newly chopped-off foot and you&#x27;re able to hobble away. What is, is. You choose, you accept.<p>So most people who think of themselves as responsible adults are not actually responsible. They are simply re-enacting behaviors and emotional patterns of a child with a parent; the parental figure often being society and other authority figures. This re-enactment happens whether someone grows up in an environment of scarcity or abundance. In face of situations that really suck, these folk regress into the helpless child, hoping someone else will make the hard choices for them or magically make things better. Or lament that, they&#x27;ve done all the right things, it&#x27;s not fair that things suck.<p>People who think of &quot;responsibility&quot; this way tends to use paternalistic language -- something, I think, that your word usage suggests.",1379189209

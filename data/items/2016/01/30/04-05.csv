But the YC-partner felt that it was still early enough for us to explore multiple opportunities simultaneously even though they lacked synergy. Also he leaned most heavily towards an enterprise idea that we were going to exclude from our list.  Furthermore, we were surprised to learn that some companies are so large that even YC can’t help much in establishing a relationship. This was really helpful to know that we should not waste resources chasing certain accounts and that just because you get into YC don’t expect everyone will suddenly return your phone call.<p>It is worth mentioning our past 30 days revenue was flat (no growth). If a new founder isn’t careful their mood is directly related to their sales. Our sales were flat, so my personality was flat. It’s tough to break out of this and we wish we had been a little more enthusiastic during the meeting.

Other times they conflict, such as when we invent birth control.<p>One of the most important concepts to take away from <i>The Selfish Gene</i> is that the idea that genes have &quot;interests&quot; is just an interesting thought experiment to explore how gene selection can lead to what appear to unselfish behaviors like cooperation, sympathy, and sacrifice.<p>Dawkins does not actually believe that genes are selfish, which IIRC he says right at the beginning of the book. So to say that the interests of genes and memes align (or don&#x27;t align) is a fundamental flaw. Neither genes nor memes have interests. They just are.<p>And further, to believe that birth control is somehow harmful to the propagation of genes is also to miss an important concept from the book: that there is more to evolution than a strict numbers game. If birth control permits parents to invest greater resources in each child, then each child will have a greater competitive advantage in the population.<p>Finally, there is a lens through which genes and memes might someday be comparable, and that is information theory.

I don't think it's a big loss to society if people aren't getting rich at this particular trade.  When authors who are really advancing the art can't make a good living, then let me know.*<p>* No, this isn't totally subjective.

949251,comment,948963,948985,0,0,philwelch,,,"Having to authorize every damn transaction (even with whitelisting) by phone would make me want to just give up and use cash most of the time. Can you imagine the user experience?<p>-You can't dare forget your phone wherever you go.<p>-You close your tab at the bar and you have to text your authorization code in (drunk) while everyone else is waiting in line behind you (because it's closing time and everyone's closing their tab at the same time).<p>-The authorization time is 60-120 seconds, long enough for you to authorize on the spot before you get your receipt. Your ISP tries charging your internet bill while you're driving, and because you're a safe and reasonable person who doesn't text while driving, the authorization times out.<p>-Or maybe the authorization time is like 3 hours, which is long enough for you to just plain not pay your bar tab, restaurant bill, or grocery bill, which means bars, restaurants, and grocery stores won't accept your card.<p>When it comes to recurring bills, here's an easier idea: on your banking history, right where it says ""Verizon"" or ""Comcast"" or ""Obfuscated Porn Site Billing"" or whatever, you can click a button that says ""stop authorizing payments to this merchant"". As the bank, if you recognized the merchant you'd send them some sort of automated message that said ""Our customer, John Doe, the owner of philwelchbankcard account 51431070970963941, has cancelled future payments to you. Please consider this as notice that Mr. Doe has cancelled any and all subscription to your service. You may contact a philwelchbank representative at 1-888-4-PW-BANK to discuss any outstanding charges or early termination fees."" So the merchant would have to either send John Doe a bill in the mail or call the bank and say ""John owes us $175 termination fee."" And then the bank would call John Doe to authorize any final charges regarding termination fees. (The intended effect is to make it more difficult to charge termination fees. It's important that the bank remain on the customer's side, not the merchant's side.)",1258582250

If it's such a mellow religion, why is there a protest full of its followers waving signs saying that they'll destroy Europe then?<p>Western people believe the line about a religion of peace because they want to, because we should all just get along and coexist in peace and harmony. That's just the humane way of life that we as Westerners are wired to like and want, but that's not what muslims have in mind.<p>----<p>Update:<p>Quick!

That is one usually has to go through all the steps of decompression to predict them there are no shortcuts.<p>Imagine a data stream X that is compressed into another data stream Y. Imagine that a small portion of X is data stream x1 which is the portion of data used for a signature. That will get compressed into y1. Now lets define x2 as all the data in X that is not x1. Now if you are always guaranteed that the same x1 would get compressed into the same y1, then things would be easily predictable and you can just compare compressed signatures.

The UI for choosing your python version and virtualenv is baked right into the IDE settings where as that is not the case when you install the Python plugin in IntelliJ. The .idea directories also do not seem to be compatible across RubyMine and IntelliJ. I have mistakenly opened up the wrong project with RubyMine and it scrambled the .idea for a non-ruby project.<p>The same is true with WebStorm, the UI and features found in WebStorm are not the same as in the JavaScript plugin.

Firefox isn&#x27;t offering 64-bit prominently because plugins have terrible support for it, and plugins don&#x27;t support it because it doesn&#x27;t exist yet... But, unlike Firefox, plugins can offer 64-bit compatible versions without angering a large number of users.

What happened to the good &#x27;ol plugin model?<p>We actually buy a license for each of these editors. We test our Floobits plugin for IntelliJ in each of these editors and they are significantly different enough that you should really have a copy of each. They also have different build numbers and different jar libraries included. This means there are differences in the code base and that could affect a plugin you might be building.<p>For example PyCharm ships with apache java libraries we also ship, and we used to have conflicts when PyCharm had a really old version. The different build numbers indicate different points of history in the IntelliJ code base. Some crucial plugin API may be in one build but not another.<p>Thankfully Jetbrains gave us a steep discount for the licenses to help us out. But even if I were not editing a plugin for Floobits I would still have to buy a license for PyCharm, WebStorm and IntelliJ separately because the Python and JavaScript plugins for IntelliJ do not have all the features the separate IDEs have.<p>I took a long time to setup Django and virtualenvs correctly so I can run and debug Floobits.com in PyCharm, I don&#x27;t see any easy way to translate that work from PyCharm to IntelliJ with the Python plugin. Same with WebStorm. Many of our services are written in node.js and translating my setup from WebStorm to the IntelliJ plugin with JavaScript doesn&#x27;t seem easy to do or even possible. It might just be I have no idea what I&#x27;m doing.",1402325335

My personal advice if you want to use that a lot is to use a different language.

If you really, really <i>need</i> overloading for your core use case, pick something else. Go is built for the environments where overloading is generally dangerous and used by people to do excessively &quot;clever&quot; things on the server, not for the environments where it is necessary.

I think that decoupling is sane move.  The Kinect seems to be magical at all things except gaming and a $100 premium for it doesn&#x27;t make sense when your competitor is outselling you.  Outside of the dance games, it really never found its calling and you can only sell so many dance games.<p>Damage control regarding the Kinect is everywhere now, including this article. I just saw that the game Destiny is jettisoning Kinect support and because of that, is now playable at a higher resolution.  MS is scrambling to make the &quot;Kinect reserve&quot; configurable instead of static. I believe the June update for the Xbox has this functionality, but how many devs will just go, &quot;Who cares&quot; and set it zero just like Bungie did with Destiny?  Most I assume, especially if their games play at 720p on Xbox w/ Kinect but 1080p on PS4.<p>I really think the Kinect is more or less dead and have blogged about it in the past:<p><a href=""http://nothingjustworks.com/microsoft-just-gave-up-on-the-kinect/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nothingjustworks.com/microsoft-just-gave-up-on-the-ki...</a><p>FWIW, I have the new Xbox with the Kinect and even as a Kinect fan I&#x27;m underwhelmed.  I also had to disable the voice turn on feature because when its on, the xbox doesn&#x27;t fully turn off, so a little fan runs 24/7 on the xbox power supply and it makes just enough noise to be annoying when watching TV and movies. In the age of silent tablets and passively cooled devices, a non-stop hum from a fan on a media center device is inexcusable.  Couldn&#x27;t they passively cooled the power supply?",1402325197

Trying to maintain ideological purity is a distraction at best and an impediment at worst, if I am ever to see an <i>[m42]</i> and have a solid intuition about its solution.<p>Even the most rousing chorus of &#x27;Onward Christian Soldiers&#x27; isn&#x27;t going to help me implement Hoare&#x27;s Quicksort in Clojure. Consing and filtering are great, but they miss the idea of working in-place. Racket&#x27;s built in O(log n)priority queue isn&#x27;t a substitute for a traditional O(1) queue implementation:<p><pre><code>   +-------+\n   |   | o-|------------------+\n   +-|-----+                  |\n     |                        |\n     v                        v\n   +-------+    +-------+   +--------+\n   |   | o-|--->|   |o-|--->|   | nil|\n   +-|-----+    +-|-----+   +-|------+\n     |            |           |   \n     v            v           v\n    &#x27;a           &#x27;b          &#x27;c\n</code></pre>\nThe built in priority queue is mutable anyway.<p>The illustration of queues in Racket isn&#x27;t rendered from whole cloth. If one searches the Racket documentation (depth first is implied?) the only hit for &#x27;queue is the priority queue which lives in the &#x27;data library [and again, it&#x27;s still mutable and not thread safe]. But the real problem is that providing Racket implementations on Rosetta code is one of those ways Racketeers are encouraged to give back, and the implementation of LIFO on Rosetta Code shows the priority queue, rather than an actual queue, in part because using &#x27;mcons is considered taboo under functional programming mores. It&#x27;s a socially acceptable answer, rather than a correct one.<p>Some things just have to be to be mutable in order to get built in a way that will be useful when dealing with large tables when the first test of usability is getting built in the first place. It&#x27;s not that playing with dangerous objects ought to be encouraged, it&#x27;s that it there&#x27;s nothing wrong with a little dynamite now and then for removing stumps when the alternative is lifting the grinder to the top of the cliff with a crane. All that really matters is acting in accord with the fact that, yes, we&#x27;re using dynamite.<p>There&#x27;s a continuum between Coq and MMIX. A good functional programming language allows refactoring a solution from right to left. It doesn&#x27;t pretend as if there isn&#x27;t a right wing or that it doesn&#x27;t matter politically.",1402324384

To make it not work, the browser would have to check whether there&#x27;s data available in the local socket buffer before issuing an HTTP request.

The government market is a little different, though, so if you work for a large company they sometimes see you as an opportunity to work on contracts that are targeted only for small business. For example, you can get these special &quot;small business only&quot; contracts and bring them to your (former) employer to work on as a subcontractor. You both win in this case.<p>The company is currently growing steadily after about 9 months in operation. We&#x27;re in this for the long term, so steady is better than a rapid ascent. We have about 5-6 employees and are generating enough to pay myself a large percentage of what I was making working for other employers (which was fairly substantial).<p>My advice is don&#x27;t burn bridges - meaning don&#x27;t let your startup work impact your &quot;day job&quot; while you are doing both. Your employer can be a gateway to your first customers, so don&#x27;t upset them.

249212,comment,248811,249110,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Very likely.  I've also noticed that whenever you put a hacker into just about any non-technical field, they can very quickly spot dozens of areas of inefficiency that could be resolved with a little technology.<p>Often, the problems aren't even hard.  Barcodes added to all forms being filed by customers, or added to ""things"" in the warehouse, or organized in a database rather than on the shelf (like Zappos does), etc.  And a lot of non-technical industries make a lot of money...saving a few dozen companies a few dozen million each year via automation is a recipe for a beautiful lifestyle business.<p>I did IT work for a guy in Austin that served court papers...a totally low-tech industry.  Individual guys (and a few rugged gals) drive out to peoples houses and personally deliver divorce court summons, etc.  The guy I worked for began automating his company in the late 80's or early 90's, several years before anyone else, and by the time I stopped working for him, I believe he had the largest process service company in Texas (and, probably the nation, since Texas is mighty big), though all are privately held, so it's hard to say for sure who was ""biggest"", but he covered nearly the whole state and almost everyone else only covered one or two cities, and had several million in revenue from ~30 or so employees and ~100 independent field agents.  Anyway, there was tons of low-hanging fruit in this industry because it had never been automated before.  And because he had lots of process servers on his payroll and many lawyers/legislators that he worked with on a regular basis, he got to shape policy with regards to how it all worked.  The state opened up electronic filings with many of its legal papers around 2005, which gave him an even bigger leg up on the competition, because all of his data was already going into a database.<p>I'm just saying that technical people might be well-served by looking at currently non-technical industries for their golden goose.  There are plenty of industries still to be saved from tedium by making computers do more of the work.",1216335209

249203,comment,248168,249037,0,0,dfox,,,"I think that the argument there is that shared memory is not useful to transfer data from one process to another, but to share data between processes. Which is quite different use case.<p>Shared memory is fast, but it is just a shared memory. You have to synchronize accesses to it in some way.<p>When you want to transfer relatively small records from one process to another, it is probably faster to send them through pipe, because the copying overhead is negligible compared to synchronization overhead, which would be there in shared memory case too (and will probably be larger).<p>So to wrap up:<p>1) In most cases it is really needed to tell kernel that you are done and want to wait on some event in other process (relying on preemption or explicit timed sleeps to switch to other process is considered bad practice)<p>2) Writing once is indeed faster than multiple times, which is in this case of many small writes argument for pipes. Because pipe lets you hand over some data to kernel and let it do any low-level synchronization details, which it can generally do better.<p>3) In UNIX, pipes/sockets are the most flexible means of IPC. And in case where you have server that reads large chunks of data from multiple clients using shared memory, synchronizing accesses to this shared memory by sockets/pipe is good idea, because you can use select(2)/poll(2) on such socket. Using mutexes or semaphores or something like that would in most cases lead to busy-waiting or unnecessary convoluted code.",1216334896

249188,comment,247894,248666,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"To repeat myself:<p>So, sure, Apple contributes to some Open Source projects...and that's a <i>good thing</i>. But Apple is hostile to openness on many fronts, and that is a <i>bad thing</i>.<p>I like that Apple is involved in Open Source, and I'm sure WebKit is more awesome than race cars and firetrucks.  And I don't begrudge anyone making money from their software--we have proprietary offerings along-side our predominantly Open Source core.  Nothing wrong with making money.  I just find Apple's hostility to open standards and basic user freedoms, particularly in the mobile space but also in music and media distribution, to be wholly at odds with so many people considering Apple to be a benevolent force in the technology industry.<p>When Microsoft can, without irony, claim to provide more open solutions to many common problems than another company, it's a really big red flag.  If Microsoft is evil (and historically, on many counts, they are), then any company that is worse than Microsoft is...well...worse than Microsoft.  Microsoft actually does offer significantly more openness in their mobile platform than Apple.  If you don't consider this a serious problem (given that mobile devices are the future of computing, and the only way a huge number of people will ever get to the Internet), then we'll just have to agree to disagree.  Nothing is going to convince me that Apple's animosity to openness on mobile devices is not a dangerous move backward for the mobile industry.",1216334210

249176,comment,248811,249137,0,0,geebee,,,"These are the right questions.  People often pose the question as a matter of age, which is almost certainly not the determining factor.  I will concede that there may be <i>some</i> loss of endurance with age that makes the startup thing harder.<p>I suspect that the OP just wants a bit of reassurance that he's not too old for this.  Of course he's not.  38 isn't too old at all.<p>I'm 36, and I wouldn't try to start a startup right now.  But that's mainly because I have, as you said, a pregnant wife, a three year old, and a mortgage.  However, I know a few people who aren't even deterred by those things and do work for startups.  I even know a founder in that situation. He is excruciatingly busy, though, and I know that it does take a toll on his personal life.<p>By the way, I think that working for startups and founding a startup are often completely different things.  In the tech heavy bay area, I don't think that a talented programmer assumes all that much risk by joining a well funded startup,  because if things head south they can often get a well paid new job within a month or two.  Furthermore, ""stable"" jobs often aren't as stable as they seem - especially if they allow you to let your skills get rusty.<p>So personally, I think that working for a small startup that pays decently and gives you some nice equity isn't all that bad an idea.  However, you won't (and probably shouldn't) get anywhere near the kind of equity that the folks who ate ramen and crammed into a 2br apartment for 18 months get.  Instead, think of it as an exciting job with a nice potential upside (I know a few parents who scored that nice upside).",1216333855

If you ban someone, you have only upset one user. If you allow a spammer/troll/flamer/etc to continue unchallenged, you have upset all of them.<p>The thing with online communities is, this is Web 2.0, your users are your product. The better the users, the better the product. If you have a good community, smart, helpful people will be attracted and will thus improve the community. If you have a bad one, they will be warded off. Scum breeds scum.<p>Think broken window theory.",1216332265

Complicated interfaces make it easy to:<p>1 - avoid forcing yourself to really prioritize your feature set, something that's really hard to do and requires really understanding your users.<p>2 - push a bunch of effort from you to the user.<p>For example, you cited A9.com.  If I do a search on A9.com, the search results window is split (by default) into two parts: one that lists web search results and one that lists book search results. At least by default, it appears that both sections are always there.<p>If I do a search on Google, than Google will usually only display web search results, but if it senses I'm searching for something about a book (example: do a search for ""Charles Dickens""), you'll sometimes see some book results up at the top.<p>Google's method of only showing you book results when it suspects you are looking for something having to do with books is both much less complex for the user and much more difficult to build.",1216332253

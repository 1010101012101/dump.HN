Like I said, none of my business.<p>\nThe world also has a lot of people that keep pushing the envelope. Finding the underlying reason they love the thing they do and making the world a better place for it. The reason you love something is greater than the thing itself. And introspection is the key to fulfillment of potential. So you can do one thing and do it well, or you can master a field and move the world. <p>\nThis article struck me as a guy who made it one time, not being content that it was his skill or that he could do anything else interesting again, so going back to the well to try again. Like I said, 2 or 3 times, sure. After that you're just doing what you are used to doing, instead of the type of thing it was the first time you did it.<p>\nI guess it just depends on the person. It was a very subjective comment, and I tried to prefix it as such.",1193575848

Usually there is an entry position, where one becomes familiar with the terms and issues of the field an achieves some initial success. Then one moves on. The other poster pointed this out, and for some reason you guys down-modded him.<p>\nI could get into a long list of people who did great in a field when they started and then matured and took the field with them. Beethoven: great pianist. Went on to become great composer. Started composing symphonies. Went deaf but still composed symphonies. Went from there to completely change music as we know it.<p>\nI could add another dozen examples. Your example of J. K. Rowling doesn't fly since she considers all of the books one unit. This would be her initial success phase. Now she could continue in the field of book writing, pushing the genre (as Beethoven did with music) or she could  move into a more generalized form of literature, say training, editing, or something else. She has an opportunity to redefine writing -- whether or not she could pull it off is up for grabs. I kind of doubt it. Or she could just cranking out that schlock that all of us read. It's up to her, and to say that she's somehow giving up her dream is BS: her dream should be about something big enough to keep pushing for. Being an artist and just making yourself and other people happy is a great dream! There are a lot of artists who find a comfortable niche and stay with that their whole life. But they aren't Beethovens. And they aren't innovators.<p>Like I said, none of my business.",1193575115

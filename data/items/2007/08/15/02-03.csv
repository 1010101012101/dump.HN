It's pretty sweet, except for the lack of dependency checks (which setuptools adds, yay).<p>Do you send your setup.py to those third party app devs?",1187144922

I think the oracles are unlikely to upvote PG essays or anything similar that might have been posted as an attempt at karma-whoring.  I certainly doubt that PG bothers to upvote links to his own writings.",1187144305

I kickstarted this big simulation as a weekend hack and let it evolve for a month, so I could come and play as Warren Beatty.<p>Can we now, as a universe, move on?<p><pre><code> * * *\n</code></pre>\nThis is not science; it's religion, philosophy, or abuse of language.  You could never prove anything about this kind of stuff either way, and IMHO throwing around probabilistic estimates is 'not even wrong'.  The scientist quoted in the article admits such estimates are only 'hunches', so I guess only the reporter is to blame for placing this stuff under a 'Science' header.<p>Now, I'm not protesting that <i>we</i> talk this.  It's fascinating stuff.  It's funny to recognize in this thread some of the same crazy ideas that would get people shuffling away from me at parties, like 'what if our whole known universe is but an atom inside other universe, which in turn [...]?'<p>Re: worlds simulated inside worlds, aka the Matrix, aka Plato's cavern- when I did work on a MMOG we had this conversation once or twice that if we gave our non-player characters ability to learn and communicate for an arbitrary length of time, eventually they'd come up with theories like <i>""Every object in the universe has an unique ID, which is a 64-bit integer""</i>.  And they'd wake up after a downtime and comment things like <i>""gee, finally capacitor recharging is fixed!""</i>, and then stop and wonder about the deep meaning of that.<p>Re: internet and cybernetic consciousness:  when I first learned about the internet, one of my first thoughts is that the interconnected computers would create a new consciousness, or an ecosystem of competing consciousnesses.    Not that it would be pursued, but that it would happen spontaneously, just like life evolved out of the primordial soup.<p>Then I thought that something similar would happen as a result of connecting so many people.  Now, it's been always like that to some extent (cultures, memes, ideologies, etc. can be thought of as supraindividual consciousnesses), but the instant communication would make it more ostensible and powerful.  Just like oxidation and explosion are instances of combustion, yet the difference in speed makes it counterintuitive for us to recognize any sameness between them.<p>Fast-forward to 2007: for about a year, the global hivemind has been thinking intensely about cats with captions.  Who knows what deep intentions hide behind this?",1187144171

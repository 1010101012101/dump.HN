10278870,comment,10278416,10278416,0,0,dv_says,,,"I&#x27;m really glad to have recently picked up Elixir. For anyone just starting, a few tips from someone similarly new:<p>a. After launching the &quot;iex&quot; shell, press Tab. You&#x27;ll get the list of all built-in commands.<p>b. The help feature is also very handy for when you&#x27;re wondering what an operator does. Type &quot;h <command>&quot; for a definition.<p><pre><code>    h !/1\n</code></pre>\nc. Try the pipe operator. Your code will closely follow the transformations of your data.<p>Instead of this:<p><pre><code>    m1 = &quot;moo&quot;\n    m2 = String.replace(m1, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;z&quot;)\n    m3 = String.upcase(m2)\n</code></pre>\nOr this:<p><pre><code>    String.upcase(String.replace(&quot;moo&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;z&quot;))\n</code></pre>\nTry this:<p><pre><code>    &quot;moo&quot; |> String.replace(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) |> String.upcase()\n</code></pre>\nThe result of each command will be passed as the first argument to the subsequent command.<p>d. You get seamless interoperability with Erlang libraries.<p><pre><code>    :crypto.hash(:md5, &quot;bob&quot;) |> Base.encode64\n</code></pre>\ne. Try the Observer tool in iex to visualize various aspects of your running application, including the supervision tree, details on each running OTP process, and much more. Seriously very handy stuff.<p><pre><code>    :observer.start()\n</code></pre>\nf. If you&#x27;re using EC2 like I am, Amazon images have a too-old version of Erlang, but it&#x27;s trivial to compile things yourself:<p><pre><code>   sudo yum install gcc glibc-devel make ncurses-devel openssl-devel autoconf\n   wget https://www2.erlang.org/download/otp_src_18.0.tar.gz\n   tar xvzf otp_src_18.0.tar.gz\n   cd otp_src_18.0\n   ./configure && make && sudo make install\n   sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/escript /usr/bin/escript\n   sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/erl /usr/bin/erl</code></pre>",1443196751

It&#x27;s much harder to sell a rewrite than it is to sell using a different language on a greenfield project.<p>If you know Elixir and are confident using it, you&#x27;ll understand its benefits and when best to use it. I work for a dev shop where we use Elixir for client work. Elixir is performant and you end up making the most out of your server resources. That would be great for clients who end up having huge traffic. But more important than performance, I find it easier to maintain Elixir code largely because it&#x27;s a functional language. Lastly, I think Elixir&#x27;s Lisp-inspired macros are a great way to write reusable libraries/modules.<p>In essence, I&#x27;m more productive with Elixir than I am with Ruby even though I used Ruby for much longer.

This stems from the false stereotype &#x27;men always want it&#x27; be it sexual advances or touching.

I will provide some bullets instead of doing direct comparisons.<p>* Concurrency is not an after thought. The primary abstraction are actors (Erlang processes) that are isolated and communicate with message passing. Data structures are also immutable which helps greatly with concurrency and also leads to clearer code (it is really comforting to know that a value won&#x27;t change under your feet).<p>* The Erlang VM: we are leveraging 30 years of knowledge in building and running fault-tolerant systems, thanks to the underlying process model. We could really go deep into this topic so I will just link to an article I wrote some time ago talking about Elixir and microservices: <a href=""http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2015/06/elixir-in-times-of-microservices/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2015/06/elixir-in-times-of-...</a><p>* Performance may also be a big deal depending on what you are doing. Elixir/Erlang are not good at number crunching but if you are running anything behind TCP/UDP, it will give you better throughput and a consistent latency compared to Ruby, Python, Node.JS, etc.<p>* We don&#x27;t have compile time checking but we do provide type specifications and a way to check them: <a href=""http://elixir-lang.org/docs/master/elixir/Kernel.Typespec.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elixir-lang.org/docs/master/elixir/Kernel.Typespec.ht...</a>. The integration between Elixir and Dialyzer is suboptimal today but if type checking is a big deal for you, it will certainly help.<p>TL;DR: Elixir is for building and running fault-tolerant, concurrent, distributed systems. It brings extensibility and great tooling to the Erlang VM. If what you are building requires 1. a TCP/UDP port and/or 2. running for a long time, you should definitely consider Elixir.

I&#x27;ve been looking at golang as my next language, but I think Elixir is even more simpler that it. Of all the functional languages that I&#x27;ve tried to get into in the past, this has the most approachable syntax, and I can see things like pattern matching helping a lot with code maintainability.<p>The performance, from whatever I&#x27;ve seen and the limited benchmarks that are out there, it compares extremely well with JVM, Node and Go. Erlang/OTP brings fault tolerance, Phoenix/Ecto etc. have been very productive, community is awesome and helpful. Erlang tooling, such as observer, is awesome and I don&#x27;t think we have anything similar in golang, though I could be wrong. Dializer helps with type checking.<p>The one thing missing is lack of a enterprise sponsor, and also number of potential hires which can be risky for startups, but on the other hand people interested in working in elixir could be an interesting hiring filter ;)",1443196240

Separate analyses assessed crash avoidance technologies, including headlamps and mirrors. The results suggest that when controlling for differences in environment and exposure, vehicles meeting EU standards offer reduced risk of serious injury in frontal/side crashes and have driver-side mirrors that reduce risk in lane-change crashes better, while vehicles meeting US standards provide a lower risk of injury in rollovers and have headlamps that make pedestrians more conspicuous.",1443195089

But now they have started coming for pure bureaucracy.<p>I have heard that some big-name companies do not even let you tell to the outside world that you interviewed with the company.  This would happen when say, just for example, if a company like Facebook would have positions for cell-phone design experts.  The justification given is actually reasonable -- the media picks up on such moves by companies extremely quickly.<p>My bet though, it is almost never about any &quot;real awesomeness&quot; of the project.

Often I am now asking myself if what I am going to do is necessary or does it have to be electronic.<p>As well as altering my choice to use, I am adding more and more security options. Mainly silly small things like the add-on that chooses HTTPS, ad blockers, or using Iron in stead of chrome, and so on. So, where I have an easy or ultimately seamless choice, Im choosing to encrypt and block. Nothing major, I know I am not secure, but more of my traffic is encrypted. Lastly, while I have used Linux servers for years, Im now trying to make Linux work for me as a Windows replacement. Partly because of the awful Windows 8 which I will down grade to from Vista (!!!), but more so because of these security issues.<p>So, nothing big, but a general move. But one key thing is that is people are anything like me, what we will see is more and more internet traffic become encrypted. Not sure what that with do to spy paranoia. Probably makes us default guilty.<p>The other plan is to use NO defenses what so ever. Open one&#x27;s self up, but never ever do anything other then the tedious benign on the internet.

Do you understand that we&#x27;re calling for non-nullable values not out of some sort of abstract concept of correctness floating in space, but from concrete experience? I suspect you&#x27;ll find that more experience correlates with a stronger belief in the need for non-nullable fields. It seems to me the people most vigorously defending the need for nulls have obviously never tried the alternative, as evidenced by their frequent belief that it&#x27;s an all-or-nothing proposition, which is not true of any language, thus strongly implying a complete lack of experience. Also implied by you asking me whether nil should even exist, which is the wrong question, again implying you don&#x27;t understand the alternative I&#x27;m advocating for here.<p>And again... it&#x27;s <i>soooo easy</i> to add them, even to existing languages, and <i>soooo easy</i> to use them.

When you slap water, it hurts because there is more incompressible water in the way of the water you slap, not because the film on the surface of the water is holding together. Falling into water from some great height is pretty similar to slapping it. A smoother entry dissipates the energy of the fall over a longer period of time, reducing the experienced forces (hence diving).",1372357646

Also: in the future, when you have a conversation about when you plan to leave the company and someone asks what date you&#x27;d like to go, pick a date 2 weeks into the future. You probably didn&#x27;t intend to refuse 2 weeks notice, but your reply could have been misinterpreted. If your employer doesn&#x27;t need/want you to stay for the 2 weeks, they&#x27;ll tell you.<p>From this point on: stop spending cycles thinking about how your ex-employer is treating you, and stop feeling sorry for yourself about that treatment. It&#x27;s over. Companies often have standard policies that kick in when people give notice which include cutting off all your accounts. Those practices will feel rude to you, but it&#x27;s best not to take them personally.<p>Your goal at this point is to be as valuable to the team as you can be (regardless of how you&#x27;re treated by the company). That&#x27;s because leaving the best possible impression of yourself with the largest number of people at your ex-employer is the only valuable outcome left for you at the job.<p>Good luck with your next job. You&#x27;re in a great market, and if you don&#x27;t like your current employer, moving on is the right decision.",1372357035

A hypothetical is to do a variable payroll tax adjusted over the course of the day to influence traffic patterns.  In the past we couldn&#x27;t do things like hourly flexing of a payroll tax, nor variable energy prices.  However, now that we are able to capture so much more info, we need to think about constructive ways to manipulate those elements.<p>I reference property above because this is the area of law thy seems most similar.  Property law is not based on absolute principles.  Rather, considering the circumstances the requirements for things like first possesion or ownership vary.

This was &quot;dark&quot; in that the network owner didn&#x27;t know anything about it besides who had access to the server closet in the CO.<p>The point is that the USA government leases a great deal of network capacity, both directly and indirectly through &quot;cover&quot; entities. Much of that is probably used to build any number of networks that carry &quot;classified&quot; data, including SIPRNet, NSANet, JWICS, and others so &quot;dark&quot; that we don&#x27;t technically know they exist. Nobody would bother to deny the existence of these, nor the obvious fact that the actual fiber belongs to the same firms that own all other long-distance fiber: ATT, L3, XO, VZN, etc.<p>I suppose it&#x27;s possible that some agencies operate the sort of &quot;secret network&quot; you were challenging, but since it costs at least ten times normal prices for spooks to do <i>anything</i>, they probably try to keep that self-built stuff to a minimum.<p>EDIT: Just so we&#x27;re clear, the security of a network does not depend on no one knowing it exists or where it is. The NSA knows encryption: no one is going to &quot;tap&quot; their fiber and find out their deep dark secrets.

That&#x27;s one of many episodes that convinces me that they play at being more ignorant than they really are in the show, for dramatic purposes; it just isn&#x27;t plausible that they do enough research to find a guy specialized in high diving, but somehow didn&#x27;t find out what he could do before he came. I enjoy the show and I enjoy the results, but wish they would be a bit more honest at times, or be a bit more willing to say &quot;Before we start, here&#x27;s what the &#x27;book&#x27; answer to the question is&quot;, because it&#x27;s often obvious they have it.

The ARM Chromebooks have been already using it to see Netflix video since a few months.

Don&#x27;t quote me on that.<p>Anyway, I think Firefox will be forced follow Chrome and IE now to implement DRM in HTML5 video. Firefox does not have the market power it once had thanks to Chrome.<p>Remember how the whole H.264 in HTML5 support thing played out for Firefox? They were on the side of not supporting it, and Google said it would remove it from Chrome, but that never happened, and Mozilla finally got tired of the effects of &quot;Firefox doesn&#x27;t support this site&#x27;s video, let me use a browser that does&quot; and added support.<p>The same thing is pretty much guaranteed to happen with EME as sites start using EME to stream video and IE, Chrome and Safari add support.",1372356209

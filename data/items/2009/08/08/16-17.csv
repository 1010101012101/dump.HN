749461,comment,749223,749416,0,0,KirinDave,,,"Sure.<p>I am not aware of any direct effort on the part of Microsoft to influence the search results in a way that deliberately attempts to obscure negative press about Microsoft's products. I would <i>not</i> be surprised if some security-related things were in fact concealed, but I can see how that might be considered unreasonable in some circles. In any event, I'm certainly not aware of any generic policy in  this regard outside of age-related filtering.<p>Now, I am a low-man on the totem pole working in a satellite office. So I wouldn't necessarily know. If I did know of such a scenario, it'd be a firing-level violation of my NDA to talk about it here, but it'd also be a violation of the ethics guidelines to lie about it publicly, so I probably wouldn't be posting here at all about this subject if I knew anything like that.<p>If I did discover Microsoft doing this, I would probably resign. But I don't believe they're doing it. Microsoft is very serious about this Bing project. I've met and talked with a lot of the people who manage the product, and they're serious, talented people who clearly understand (and have directly said to us) that a search engine is about results and people trusting those results. It would be incredibly risky to deliberately filter things in Bing and risk discovery at the formative stage of Bing-as-a-brand's reputation.<p>PS. ""Fudge factors"" are just some things like saying, ""Wikipedia and c2.com are awesome, give them a nice boost."" It's pretty clear that Google loves Wikipedia even more than  what we know about its ranking algorithm's major features would suggest. Once upon a time all wikis scored very highly in google because of the way page rank and link text worked, but they've since reduced that effect, it seems. Wikipedia's ranking never really went down.<p>PPS. I really can't talk about specific features of Bing or Powerset's ranking algorithm. One reason for this is my NDA. The other reason is that they're not my primary domain of expertise, so I'd feel uncomfortable lecturing about them instead of their actual architects, who are often unsung heros of a search team.",1249749469

749437,comment,748102,748697,0,0,CWuestefeld,,,"<i>The answer to your question is over 46.6 million Americans..., the ones without health insurance</i><p>As the sibling replies noted, <i>everyone</i> in America <i>does</i> have access to at least basic healthcare. If a homeless person is brought into the emergency room after being hit by a car, he won't be denied treatment. The Medicaid program in America reimburses hospitals (and other providers) for charity and bad debt expenses.<p><i>Right now 25% of every health care dollar spent is going towards administrative expenses</i><p>I've got an unusually close view of this, as my wife is the manager of budget and reimbursement at a largish urban hospital. Most of her job is dealing with Medicaid and Medicare, getting the hospital reimbursed for caring for these people. The reason that she spends most of her (and her department's) time on this is because of the illusion that M&M have efficient administration.<p>In reality, Medicare and Medicaid account for a huge portion of cases in an urban hospital. They're an 800-lb gorilla: since they account for so much of the hospital's business, the hospitals have little choice but to provide whatever administrative functions that M&M demand. For example, every year my wife must submit the dreaded ""Medicare Cost Report"". This is literally a <i>crate</i> of documents that my wife's team creates (it takes the team weeks) to document their Medicare charges over the past year. Some time later, the government audits them on this entire crate.<p>What I'm trying to illustrate is that the actual administrative expenses of Medicare and Medicaid are not really lower than our traditional model. It's just that the regulators force the participants to run it in such a way that the providers bear a large portion of the administrative burden. Since it's on the providers, the costs don't show up on M&M's reports as admin expenses. Instead, they contribute to higher prices billed for the underlying services.<p>When you look at the big picture, Medicare and Medicaid are certainly no more efficient than conventional providers, and possibly less so.<p>For example, one of the concerns in rising costs is unnecessary tests. However, M&M regulations tend to <i>cause</i> this. They will refuse to cover the costs associated with various types of infections (e.g., urinary infections) unless the provider can prove that the infection was already present when the patient was admitted. This effectively forces the hospital to test all patients for UTI at the time they're admitted, which is completely unnecessary for actual medical reasons.<p>Any expectation that total costs would go down due to some miracle of government administration is pure fantasy. Seriously: have you ever been to the DMV, or seen an Immigration office? Why would you believe that a private insurer, given the opportunity to increase profits by lowering their own admin expenses, would not do so? The idea that government-provided healthcare, or government-single-payer, would lower costs really is magic. Just like a belief in the magic of Tinkerbell and Harry Potter.<p>(Note: I lumped Medicare and Medicaid together for simplicity. While these are related, they're separate entities and anybody who knows the details will probably object. But there's only so much space here.)",1249748332

But I’m going to take the unpopular side here and point out that, in an imperfect world, this is how things have to work.<p>Let me explain my point.  Politicians often aren’t the brightest bulbs in the set.  They are people who can convince a lot of other people to like them which makes most the equivalent of good con men.  So after they’re elected they tend not to think things through and make simplistic laws like “Any adult performing any sex act on a minor is guilty” (which of course ignores the 17 year old having consensual sex with the 15 year old in high school).  But there are checks on a law’s power.  Cops and Judges both have discretion for this very reason.  But sometimes the system fails and you get lazy cops, a lazy judge and a lazy prosecutor who all don’t care enough to do their job.  Then you end up with the situation quoted in the first part of this article.<p>But here’s the thing: Yes, I think it’s unjust and I think the politicians, lawyer, judge, cops, etc... in this story are all deplorable fools.  But the world will always have deplorable fools and only when someone’s burned by them do the rest of us realize something’s wrong so we can fix it.  As the article points out the law that got this woman into trouble no longer exists because people saw the abuse and demanded it be changed.<p>So one person suffers but thousands of others won’t in the future.  I wish that one person didn’t have to suffer but it’s inherent in a system where the primary skill of our elected officials is “likability” rather than “intelligence”",1249747547

I'm still working out how I want them to react in the final version (changing colour + speed/intensity), then I'm going to hook it up to a foot pedal as well so I can trigger it selectively (e.g., during the chorus of a couple songs) and build the actual backdrop setup.<p>The Arduino is really fun.

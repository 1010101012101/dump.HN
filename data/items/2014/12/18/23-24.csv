(Hipchat/Campfire/etc also an option, but I prefer Slack for UX reasons.)<p>For example, when a new lead is added in Close.io, send to #ar-sales:<p>New lead for AR: Customer Foo ( foo@example.com )<p><a href=""https://app.close.io/lead/$REDACTED"" rel=""nofollow"">https://app.close.io/lead/$REDACTED</a><p>Dashboard: <a href=""https://www.appointmentreminder.org/a/admin/show_account/$REDACTED"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.appointmentreminder.org/a/admin/show_account/$RE...</a><p>This lets people who care about AR sales have conversations in that room about it and get notifications right when a new lead happens.  Then someone can say &quot;Spiffy, I&#x27;ve got a minute, I&#x27;ll give them a call.&quot;  &quot;Gave them a call.  Not a great fit for our solution, but we&#x27;ll try again in a few months.&quot;  or &quot;That looks to be a doctor.  @patrick can you deal with them?

It&#x27;s easier for people to subscribe to Slack notifications (by being in the right channel) than to have them spend days configuring Gmail to e.g. filter out notifications from the monitoring software except when, spreads out the knowledge of events among time and people, and helps make the company feel like a community of purpose rather than N disconnected inboxes which happen to receive checks from the same bank account.",1418947131

8770367,comment,8769067,8769067,0,0,greeneggs,,,"Very nice.  I wonder if training can be simplified by training pieces of the model separately, instead of training all together.  For example, the DeepSpeech model has three layers of feedforward neurons (where the inputs to the first layer are overlapping contexts of audio), followed by a bi-directional recurrent layer, followed by another feedforward layer.  What would the results be if we trained the first layers (perhaps all three) on a different problem, such as autoencoding or fill-in-the-blank (as in word2vec), and then fixed those network weights to train the rest of the network?<p>Breaking the network up like this would reduce training time and perhaps reduce the needed training data.  Since the first layers could be trained without supervision, less labeled data would be needed to train the last two layers.  It would also facilitate transferring models between problems; the output of the first few layers, like a word2vec, could be fed into arbitrary other machine learning problems, e.g., translation.<p>If this does not work, then how about training the whole model together, but only once?  The final results are reported for an ensemble of six independently trained networks.  What if started by training one network, and then fixed the first three layers to train other networks?  (Instead of fixing the first layers, you could also just give them a slower training rate, although it isn&#x27;t clear whether that would save you much.)",1418946397

I would attach a couple of caveats that are very situationally dependent.<p>1) I have found some value in phone screens if they are more about the selling of the company and the clarifying the process.  The only factors I&#x27;ve ever found worth eliminating a candidate for at the phone screen level is if they do not have the tools/communication skills to move forward with the  rest of the process and/or you catch them in outright lies about their resumes (though I highly discount resumes, I discount lying on them even more).  Sometimes it is just too resource intensive to do the pre-interview any other way than a phone call, and I&#x27;d rather do the phone screen than not consider the candidate.<p>2) I completely agree with deprecating person-to-person interviews, but that is a very hard sell.  If you want to accomplish that but are getting push back, the interview script process is a valuable tool for eliminating the interviews.  It provides data to backup the argument and as no one will want to do scripted interviews they will become allies in getting rid of them.<p>3) Campus recruiting can be valuable for organizations that are prepared to take on the responsibility of hiring a new grad.<p>Having a data driven approach (ie scoring your process) is the most important advice.",1418946212

8770293,comment,8767073,8770012,0,0,takinola,,,"Sure, that is the role of the courts.  However, in this case, that distinction rested on the definition of what constituted a certain peice of technology and the ability to predict how that technology was going to evolve.  The courts had no way of knowing the answer to this question.  To their credit, I honestly doubt the companies themselves even knew the answer at that time.<p>This situation was very different than when an oil company uses their monopolistic position in refineries to choke competing exploration and retail companies.  Or when a manufacturer of telephone equipment uses the profits from its monopoly in that business to drive out competitors in its telephone service business.  Clearly, in these scenarios, it was clear (and remains clear) that the monopolists were using resources from one business where they were clearly dominant to out-compete other companies in separate (even if adjacent) businesses.<p>Technology is a very tricky area for the law largely because it is fast changing.  Situations are cropping up far faster than the laws can be modified to address them and so the courts are pretty much forced to sand-off the edges of existing statutes that were designed for other situations and hope for the best.",1418945251

Really interesting discussion by the way, I&#x27;m happy so many people take an interest in this film!<p>Not really family/adoption:<p>To be honest, the whole history of the Houshi family is kind of a mistery. There was no real documentation in paper back then. No photos, and paintings or such were only for rich people. Yet, the whole town kinda grew around the hot springs and this one hotel in particular. So the history of the hotel and the family is very much connected with the history of the town. That&#x27;s also where the proof for the Guinness Bureau came from. They wouldn&#x27;t just accept them saying &quot;yea, we old.&quot;<p>What changed in 2011:\nAn even older hotel submitted their application.<p>Also: as far as I found out, that older hotel is not a straight &quot;same-family&quot; business, or at least not anymore. I&#x27;m a bit sceptical of that posted source below. \nThere&#x27;s an association for family businesses older than 200 years AND still running, and that hotel is not part of that, Houshi is.<p>The daughters motivation:\nI shot this film over the course of six days, in April and in June. When I was doing the interviews in April, the daughter didn&#x27;t actually know that her father decided that she should take over. I was the one who told her during the interview (assuming then she was aware of it of course). She officially started in May, and when I came back in June, she was much more adjusted. She&#x27;s actually doing pretty well. \nThere&#x27;s also a second son, even working in the hotel, longer than the daughter. but according to the father, he&#x27;s not smart enough to manage the inn. The daughter is actually much stronger and smarter than she thinks she is. That&#x27;s why the father chose her. \nIn 1,300 years, no woman was the official owner of the inn. However, they were allowed to be &quot;temporary owners&quot; until the son came of age or someone was adopted. Yet, the father considers giving the daughter now the title of Zengoro. She would be the first woman in 1,300 years to wear that title. But it&#x27;s not final yet. I consider going back there in a couple of years to see what&#x27;s changed.<p>The first born son gets trained from day one to become the owner. The daughter wasn&#x27;t properly prepared. Yet, she loves her family dearly and is caught between her love, obligation and duty. For someone carrying the weight of 1,300 years and 46 generations, she is doing remarkably well.",1418943837

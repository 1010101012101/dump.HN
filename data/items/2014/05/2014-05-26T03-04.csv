7798631,comment,7798139,7798139,1,0,ggchappell,,,"I think I agree with your basic point: that we need to be careful and thoughtful about how new technology is used.<p>However, I think there might be some misunderstandings here about how research works.<p>In the Rapoport-Kedzierski-Sarpeshkar paper[1], you will find no mentions of prosthetics or anything similar. It does not touch on applications. The mentions of prosthetics you cite all come from the MIT News article[2], written by one Anne Trafton, who is not a researcher. She apparently interviewed at least one of the researchers (Benjamin Rapoport). And the only quote from him is simple agreement: yes, that&#x27;s the sort of thing you might eventually be able to do with our work.<p>This gives an easy answer to your question, &quot;Why are articles about emerging technology overwhelmingly positive?&quot; The answer is that they are written by -- or using information from -- university P.R. people. The job of these people is to make the university look good.<p>One of the challenges these people face is that university research is mostly not aimed at products. It is basic research without any immediate application. So they try to explain where the research might eventually be headed. And of course they use positive examples -- remember what their job is.<p>You note that, &quot;... the publicly authentic researcher is really rare.&quot; This is true. But an important reason it is true is that the researcher who communicates about research with the public -- in any form -- is rare. Mostly researchers aim their communications at other researchers, leaving it to others (as in this case) -- or more often to no one at all -- to present their work to the general public.<p>And then we have your solution, which you say you will describe in detail tomorrow. I&#x27;ll read that when you post it. But for the moment, you&#x27;re talking about regulation.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine how that could work in a positive way. Are we going to forbid any research with (say) a military application? You are correct that there are possible nasty uses for brain-machine interfaces. Meanwhile, the world is loaded with handicapped or otherwise debilitated people, and with all respect (seriously!) to the builders of prosthetic devices, at the moment, their work is mostly awful. Are we not going to allow research that would help all those people, just because we know that (say) the Pentagon wants to use it, too?<p>This is especially important, because the nasty folks are going to get it anyway. We already have a proof of concept for a successful secret basic-research community: the NSA&#x27;s enormous mathematics research arm. The university-research people at least make their findings public, so that we <i>can</i> keep an eye on them. Let&#x27;s try to avoid regulating that away.<p>P.S.

We think not. Instead of writing your email logic in your code, we ask you to send events to us, as you&#x27;d do with Mixpanel/GA. You can then configure emails as triggers from our dashboard.<p>Benefits:<p>* Flexibility in adding/modifying your emails without code changes<p>* Test out different schedule intervals, email messages<p>* Add drip campaigns based on customer events - an &quot;ordered&quot; event is enough to send a transaction email, a feedback email and perhaps even a reminder email for a repeat purchase.<p>* We are adding support for push notifications/sms next, so especially useful if you are already sending different kinds of messages.<p>What do you think about the service?

Vim&#x27;s help is easy enough to use that you can `:helpgrep topic` or just `:help top<tab>` to list all the help topics and go from there.<p>Sure you can achieve the same thing by searching online. However, I believe that reading Vim&#x27;s help motivates you to learn more commands and be more efficient with it. There&#x27;s so many things in `:h motion.txt` that online articles don&#x27;t mention and I would probably never come across them.<p>Similarly, with Git, I did learn to add, commit push but then I learned to reach for `git help topicname` if I want some documentation on that topic name.",1401076417
7798617,comment,7798134,7798134,4,0,tikhonj,,,"No!<p>EDIT: As a side note, I hope my tone doesn&#x27;t come across as too harsh. I feel a bit bad about writing this way, but it&#x27;s just something I&#x27;ve been thinking aboutâ€”and frustrated byâ€”for a while. I have no problems whatsoever with the author of this piece. I just want to make sure that people really pick up on where it&#x27;s off the mark, and I&#x27;m a bit frustratedâ€”largely with myselfâ€”that there is no good explanation of functional programming and monads that avoids many of these problems.<p>That is <i>not</i> the way to think about monads. It&#x27;s an unfortunate failure of education/PR that people hang on to this notion. The way monads are often presented, it&#x27;s a very natural conclusion. But it&#x27;s also entirely misleading.<p>Monads are not tied to functional programming. They are not tied to <i>pure</i> functional programming. They are <i>not</i> about introducing IO effects to otherwise pure programs.<p>There is <i>one</i> that does that. One type that&#x27;s a monad and that manages effects in Haskell. IO. But that is the IO type. Other monads? Other code using monads? It often has <i>nothing</i> to do with adding effects to a pure language! (Unless you stretch the definition of &quot;effect&quot;, which, to be fair, many people do.)<p>There are lots of other monads. Lots! You can think of most Linq code as using <i>some</i> monadâ€”but never for effects. It&#x27;s in Câ™¯, after all. Practically Java, and about as far from pure as you can get. Promises, in JavaScript, form a hobbled monad, which could trivially be a completely reasonable and correct monad if the people writing the spec weren&#x27;t violently opposed to it.<p>The Wikipedia description... was not bad. Even if the author found it confusing. It wasn&#x27;t great either. Even that was too narrow.<p>I like to think of it like this: a monad gives us a new, custom, way to <i>compose</i> things. In the case of IO, it does, indeed, give us a way to compose effectful programs. In the case of List, it gives us a way to compose nondeterministic functions (ie backtracking). In the case of Maybe, it lets us compose functions that may fail (ie early termination). And so on.<p>And the final paragraphs showcase yet another unjustified belief: that pure functional programming is basically just imperative programming <i>but less</i>. That&#x27;s something I really need to write about <i>at length</i>. Suffice to say, it&#x27;s more enlightening to think of pure functional programmingâ€”especially like Haskellâ€”as almost <i>orthogonal</i> to imperative programming, not as a subset.<p>But, again, this is not something clear from most Haskell learning materials or evangelism. It&#x27;s just so easy to describe it as imperative programming without assignment or imperative programming without side effects or... I did the same thing myself when I started. But that turned out not to be a good description at all. If anything, it just serves to confuse as soon as you get to intermediate or advanced Haskell topics.<p>I completely understand why people take this tack. The best way to learn is by drawing connections and analogies to what you know. And Haskell learning materials don&#x27;t exactly provide the contrast or elucidation you&#x27;d need to avoid many of these pitfalls. I&#x27;m not sure what the best approach to rectifying this is, so for now I&#x27;ll just write a few blog posts about it and not much more...<p>If you&#x27;re curious, I&#x27;ve tried my hand at explaining monads too. But what I wrote is way too long and too rough and too unedited and, for all three reasons, on Quora[1]. Still, might be worth a look.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Functional-Programming/What-are-monads-and-why-are-they-useful/answer/Tikhon-Jelvis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Functional-Programming/What-are-monads-...</a>",1401076412

Nobody tries to learn something new by checking out what a random key does, using :help X. When I was trying to learn Vim, the most useful info was actually search results for &quot;how to do X with Vim&quot;, because everybody knows A) another editor, probably B) what they want to achieve. After that you slowly discover features one after the other, which can only happen by using the editor a lot. It&#x27;s good to have a &quot;help X&quot; around, but most of the time, if you&#x27;re starting out, you don&#x27;t know that X is what you need in the first place.<p>People learning git don&#x27;t start with typing &quot;git rebase --help&quot; just to see what it does.

7798577,comment,7797155,7797155,23,0,robert_tweed,,,"This is a pretty good article, but I&#x27;m seeing a lot of confusion in this thread because the article is maybe one step ahead of the basic intuition needed to understand why ANNs are not magical and are not artificial intelligence (at least not feed-forward networks).<p>Perhaps a simpler way to look at it is to understand that a feed-forward ANN is basically just a really fancy transformation matrix.<p>OK, so unless you know linear algebra, you&#x27;re probably now asking what&#x27;s a transformation matrix? Without the full explanation, the important understanding is why they are so important in 3D graphics: they can perform essentially arbitrary operations (translation, rotation, scaling) on points/vectors. Once you have set up your matrix, it will dutifully perform the same transformations on every point/vector you give it. In graphics programming, we use 4x4 matrices to perform these transformations on 3D points (vertices) but the same principle works in any number of dimensions - you just need a matrix that is one bigger than the number of dimensions in your data*.<p>Edit: For NNs the matrices don&#x27;t always have to be square. For instance you might want your output space to have far fewer dimensions that your input. If you want a simple yes/no decision then your output space is one-dimensional. The only reason the matrices are square in 3D graphics is because the vertices are always 3-dimensional.<p>What a neural network does is take a bunch of &quot;points&quot; (the input data) in some arbitrary, high number of dimensions and performs the same transformation on all of them, so as to distort that space. The reason it does this is so that the points go from being some complex intertwining that might appear random or intractable, into something where the points are linearly separable: i.e., we can now draw a series of planes in between the data that segments it into the classifications we care about.<p>The only difference between a transformation matrix and a neural network is that a neural network has at least two layers. In other words, it is two (or more) transformation matrices bolted together. For reasons that are a bit too complex to get into here, allows an NN to perform more complex transformations than a single matrix can. In fact, it turns out that an arbitrarily large NN can perform any polynomial-based transformation on the data.<p>The reason this is often seen as somewhat magic is that although you can tell what transformations a neural network is doing in trivial cases, NNs are generally used where the number of dimensions is so large that reasoning about what it is doing is difficult. Different training methods can give wildly different networks that seemingly give much the same results, or fairly similar networks that give wildly different results. How easy it is to understand the various convolutions that are taking place rather depends on what the input data represents. In the case of computer vision it can be quite easy to visualise the features that each neuron in the hidden layer is looking for. In cases where the data is more arbitrary, it can be much harder to reason about, so if your training algorithm isn&#x27;t performing as you&#x27;d like, it can be difficult to understand why it isn&#x27;t working, even if you already understand that the basic principle of a feed-forward network is just a bunch of simple algebra.",1401075576

For example, the number 15 represents 1 unit in \n    the tens position, and 5 in the singular position - essentially 1 Ã— 10 + 5 Ã— 1.\n    Likewise, 314 is 3 Ã— 100 + 1 Ã— 10 + 4 Ã— 1. This is read as 3 units in hundreds \n    position, 1 unit in the tens  position, and 4 units in the singular position\n    There also exists numerical systems which are non-positoinal. Perhaps \n    the most famous example are Roman numerals. Itâ€™s also positional-ish, since \n    the position of the numerals are somewhat important for specific cases - \n    VI and IV mean very different things. The Mayan numeral system is another \n    example of a non-positional system, intermixed with a unary-ish system.\n\n    Most positional numerical systems have somewhat evolved into the same state, \n    despite having different runes and conventions to represent the same thing. \n    But perhaps the greatest innovation to numerical systems is the representation\n    of fractional numbers\uE0C0 in a positional numerical system. It allowed us \n    to do really much fancier mathematics. However, as can be seen in the example\n    with 1/3 above, representing a fraction in a positional numerical system is\n    somewhat difficult.\n\n    The reason why this section is even here is to function as a reminder to the\n    reader that binary numerical systems used by modern computers are also \n    just another system - imagine it to be from another civilization, if you will\n     - and not be intimidated by it.\n\n    \uE0C0 Speaking of fractions, the ancient Egyptians were one of the first civilizations \n    to use a fraction system (the Chinese were the other). Especially by modern day\n    standards, it was a very interesting fraction system. The fractions used by ancient\n    Egyptians are expressed only in terms of unit fractions\n    - i.e. fractions with 1 as the numerator.\n\n</code></pre>\nThere was quite a lot of junk cut out from my book too about ancient chinese numerical systems - they had different numerical systems for different classes of people, and different numerical systems for different bases. And even had negative numbers!<p>Your question is actually a question of positional and nonpositional notation. I&#x27;m quite sure we&#x27;ll stick with positional notations for some time to come, but uh, you never know about the future. For all we know, there could be a superior nonpositional system out there.",1401075554

Comments like this make a strong case against being able to delete comments. In order for karma to be most effective it seems that it must not only quantify a user&#x27;s positive contributions but also the user&#x27;s negative contributions. If a user knows they can make potentially dumb/offensive comments and delete them before taking a karma hit they do not need to filter their thoughts before hitting submit. In my opinion clicking submit is an implicit statement that I stand by my comment and that it was submitted in good faith and is a sincere expression of my opinion.<p>I am not entirely sure what the purpose of delete is. If someone asks &quot;what is the X of y?&quot; and my response is factually incorrect the comment/answer will be downvoted.

Accordingly, many of the really important messages internally and externally are passed after hours with a beer in hand.

Maybe that makes me a terrible person, I&#x27;m not sure.<p>But I think this is a rare useful addition to the corpus on layman understanding of &quot;what is a monad?&quot; Because it goes to an effort to try to destructure the problem and attack it from the angle of &quot;why is a monad useful?&quot;, the answer to which, to most people, amounts to &quot;it probably isn&#x27;t to you right now, but it might be someday.&quot;<p>What it really comes down to, though, is that a monad is a way for you to define a program that actually Does Useful Things (like ask questions and act on them and output answers and occasionally tell you you&#x27;re doing it wrong). You can use a C++ compiler or a ruby interpreter for this, or you can write a program in Haskell that generates one. And if you do the latter, monads are the construct that you build them with.<p>From there you have to explain why there&#x27;s a benefit to going the roundabout route to useful things, but no one&#x27;s going to understand them until they understand that basic premise.",1401073792

Yahoo has no way of knowing that you are actually the owner.

They&#x27;re just going to pick an arbitrary point which is going to be different for everyone. You can label the points (10 is winning gold at the Olympics, 1 is your spouse dying) but it&#x27;s really hard to place something like buying concert tickets onto that scale.<p>The only way you could get actual information out of such a study would be to ask the <i>same</i> student how satisfied they are with a row 10 seat, a better seat, and a worse seat, but that will only tell you the obvious - that they are to some extent more satisfied with the better seat and less satisfied with the worse seat - and not give you any interesting information about whether it&#x27;s a significant difference.",1401073407

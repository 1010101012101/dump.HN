That bug does pop up every once in awhile, but almost always in the context of a function that returns a reference to one of many different possible variables depending on some condition in the function.<p>Does Rust really call its threads &quot;green threads&quot;? Green threads have a weird reputation.<p>Copy like &quot;this allows you to, well, read and write the data&quot; could be tightened up; it&#x27;s an attempt at conversational style that doesn&#x27;t add much. &quot;That doesn&#x27;t seem too hard, right?&quot; is another example of the same thing.<p>How much of Rust concurrency is this covering? How much of its memory model?

7052003,comment,7048808,7048808,1,0,hootener,,,"Here are three instances where Docker made my life way easier:<p>Docker as an educational tool can be pretty powerful. One of the most annoying parts of CS courses is the initial install/configure/dependency wrangling you have to do to install required applications in whatever courses you happen to be taking that semester. Since courses may have different and conflicting requirements, just preparing your machine to use for coursework can be a nightmare.<p>Docker solved this problem for me as a student, and I can imagine it being solved easily for others if professors would just latch on to it and provide DockerFiles for their students. Sure, OS X and Windows users may have the initial hassle of setting up VirtualBox or what not, but I think the trade off is worth it. And when the course is over, there&#x27;s no longer a lot of development software sitting around your hard drive that you may never use again. Take any source you developed, the DockerFile you used, throw it all in a repo and then you can easily replicate the build environment if you need it later on.<p>As a developer, I use Docker to replicate &quot;large scale&quot; deployments on my own machine. Typically this is just a database container, a nodeJS server container, and a container for my web application code. However, as an exercise I&#x27;ve spun up a container with NGINX to act as load balancers for multiple running instances of my webapp container. It was simple, repeatable, and can be easily replicated on production servers.<p>Finally, onboarding of new developers becomes MUCH simpler with Docker. I developed bash scripts to quickly spin up containers for development and production workflows. So onboarding new developers to my codebase is fairly easy. I distribute the source code of the project, a repo that contains DockerFiles and bash scripts, and a small readme. Developers are typically up and running in less than an hour, regardless of their operating system of choice.",1389634457

Second, it makes the system more complicated because there are multiple library copies floating around the filesystem. Third, it means that when you really do need to change a library/dependency, you can&#x27;t just update the libfoo package, you have to update every application.<p>In my experience (Linux on the desktop), bundling dependencies is an indicator of poor software quality, but I realize that the situation may be different on other systems.<p>In this case, I think that the solution is to use the distro&#x27;s package manager to pin minor versions and rely on the distribution&#x27;s updates for security fixes. Hosting your own repo is a bad idea, since it means you won&#x27;t get any software updates. Software updates are really important -- they have security patches and bug fixes.

Is it reasonable to expect everyone to know how to run VMs of old operating systems (where you are already in questionable legal water if you download isos of, say, Windows 98, which is no longer available for money but still is copyrighted forever).<p>And titles like &quot;Baldurs Gate Enhanced Edition&quot; I feel hurt the industry hugely by presenting the legal departments an excuse to deny source release, because later on they could touch the game up for a few weeks and sell it all over again. Same way companies like Square will re-release 20 year old games like Final Fantasy rather than do source releases on the original engine code. Except for most games they won&#x27;t see a re-release, and they will just drift into the binary purgatory of unrunnable titles.",1389634093

7051899,comment,7051091,7051862,11,0,saurik,,,"Same (and to be clear, this is from someone who only &quot;switched&quot; to OS X a few years ago because of the demands of my user community: and for the first year I hated it, as I liked neither the hardware nor OS X 10.5). So, to add some concrete-ness: what fundamentally makes OS X better at this is the way the command key is used; almost everything that has to do with the UI or the system is bound to the command key, which means that control and option are free for usage by my terminal. I thereby never run into any confusion using ctrl-c to copy something or alt-tab to switch between windows: command means nothing to my terminal, and control and option get bound to control and alt (not the default in Terminal, but its one checkbox to fix), passed to whatever actual application I&#x27;m running. On both Windows and Linux the control and alt keys tend to overlap in usage between graphical and console applications, meaning the graphical terminal I&#x27;m using invariably has some confusing overlap with the keyboard commands I might want to send to my console app. (Now, there are some unfortunate defaults in Terminal with relation to page up/down and home/end, but those are both easily fixed--a few minutes of setup before sitting down--and somewhat irrelevant as any one who even remotely cares about using a terminal should have installed iTerm2 forever ago.) (Ironically and relevantly, the reason Terminal has irritating defaults is specifically because Apple has actually been really good about having keyboard shortcuts be consistent across every application: they want option, page up, and home to do the exact same things in Terminal that it would do in any other app, even to the extent to which those behaviors are useless and counter-productive when you are actually just trying to use vim/emacs and bash/zsh like a normal person ;P.)",1389633483

The encoder &quot;tools&quot; can be used in many different ways (with different parameters and combinations) to produce valid encoded versions of input data. The decoder then uses various methods to take the tools and data used in the encoded version, and interpolates the encoded data into something resembling the original. Sometimes that interpolation is &quot;lossy&quot; (detail is lost, but may be acceptably close to the original), while other times it is &quot;lossless&quot; (decoded bit-for-bit to be the same as the original).<p>Just like there are many ways to encode data with a given codec/format, there are often many different ways (or tools used) to decode, some of which - as in the case of lossy codecs - may produce more &quot;natural&quot; or pleasing results than others. For example, some MPEG decoders will analyze motion vectors and interpolate extra spatial resolution that was not present in the original, thereby &quot;upscaling&quot; (e.g., from standard resolution to HD) the output. In this case, it&#x27;s important to remember that data/detail is never created from nothing, but is instead &quot;guessed&quot;, so it may produce nice-looking results, but it&#x27;s also likely to introduce more artifacts (erroneous details that were actually not present in the original).",1389632438

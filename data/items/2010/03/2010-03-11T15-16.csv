In particular, he points out ZumoDrive's encryption is not protected by a key known only to the owner of the data, and he points out that there are plenty of points where the plaintext and/or keys can leak out for a variety of legal and technical reasons.<p>Colin does describe some technical aspects of TarSnap: at <a href=""http://www.tarsnap.com/security.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tarsnap.com/security.html</a> and <a href=""http://www.tarsnap.com/crypto.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tarsnap.com/crypto.html</a>. In addition, he's written some very good articles about practical issues regarding crypto on his blog. (If I was going to criticize him for anything about his blog, it would be the poor UI for navigating the archives.)<p>Also, is this really a case of one company simply ""bashing"" a competitor? I don't think so. From reading his blog, Colin seems to be very passionate about crypto and security. This blog post is the same kind of reaction that many of us who are passionate about security and privacy would have. See Schneier's numerous ""doghouse"" posts for example. Also, see Colin's blog post where he explained what was wrong with AWS signing V1; AWS was a partner, not a competitor.<p>Colin's criticism of SSL/TLS should be expanded upon so we can see exactly why he thinks it is only good for key management. However, he is correct that ""client encrypts, client sends to server, server decrypts, then server encrypt again with its own key"" is not a great design.<p>Also, Colin doesn't mention anything about OpenSSL in his post.<p>(Non-)disclaimer: I've never met Colin or anybody involved in this discussion, and I have no business dealings with anybody involved.",1268321778

They have the unencrypted data pass through their server. They almost certainly also have the final encryption key sitting on that server for all the data stored. This is a completely unnecessary hole in the security. There are other probable problems (such as given their obvious lack of understanding the basics I wouldn't be the least surprised to find that they've messed up the way they are using AES to encrypt the data) but really just this is more than enough to know to stay away.<p>Tarsnap on the other hand does correctly encrypt the data and have the keys held by the client <i>and</i> this can be verified because the complete client side source code is available.",1268321776

Talking about security in rigorous technical terms in your marketing material is a terrible idea. When you yell at one startup for calling SSL and AES ""military grade"", you're making an untenable argument against most startup marketing.<p>(2) It makes the inane assertion that SSL/TLS is inferior to hand-rolled cryptography (paraphrased, ""because when you own the client and the server you can pre-distribute keys and avoid all of SSL's complexity""). Hold two thoughts together in your head: first, that when Colin implements something like this, he's apt to be correct; and second, that when <i>anybody else</i> does it, they're apt to go catastrophically awry. If Zumodrive had done anything but TLS, they'd have me yelling at them, not Colin. And based on generalist developer crypto, I'm betting my yelling would be a lot scarier.<p>(3) It's sniping at a competitor about security. Talking up your own security is good. Talking down someone else's security is dangerous. It's bad marketing (it's turned me --- at least for the day --- from an advocate to a detractor) and it's bad business.<p>There's a lot of content in Colin's post I didn't feel the need to address. Am I wrong about any of those 3 points though? If not, I'm happy with my comment.",1268321533

It is in normal in China to suffer delays when you order something from a factory. It is normal when doing business in China.<p>That may be.

No, it does <i>NOT</i> have phone functionality, it is a media player with wifi, that you can graft phone functionality on to, but you'll be left with a dongle sticking out of your device, which is not the same as having that functionality built in.<p>> Scrape together all the money ? you must be joking.

Because selling fake watches is legal in China. But it isn't elsewhere in the world, and that's where you're selling them in to. That's a shady business, one that can land you in plenty of hot water in the US and in Europe.<p>Basically your business model was on how to detect people that sell the stuff that you sold.

Both need to be kinda up-to-date in order to have this run smoothly and virus free.<p>So I'm not certain the government could just ""vaccinate computers"" (by upgrading Windows/antivirus): just think of the user-level applications incompatibilities.<p>But the governments might think about what does it mean to have a critical global infrastructure product that depends only on one (foreign) company: Microsoft. I wouldn't like that... So while nationalizing stuff doesn't sound really nice, perhaps the government(s) should start defining some regulations on the quality of Windows as well as a control body.

1183849,comment,1183327,1183803,0,0,Groxx,,,"1) I'll seriously disagree with you on this.  Flash is likely much easier, because it's designed around doing this, but it's easily possible in Canvas too.  Just maybe not currently.  An OpenGL-like pipeline to help figure out what you clicked on, combined with JavaScript objects that can draw themselves, allows identical behavior.  I don't know about interaction speed, can't comment on that.  And I'm only using OpenGL as an example because I have some idea of how it works, there are other ways to detect what was clicked.<p>Heck, if you wanted, you could literally duplicate OpenGL in its entirety in JS for Canvas.  There's <i>nothing</i> preventing this, except lack of threading / parallel processing, though I admit it'd be ungodly slow.<p>2) Also primarily a problem currently, and likely due mostly to the lack of mature libraries to do just this.  With compositing rules (source-over, source-atop, etc) and masks for objects, you can re-render only the displayed portion of any object on a Canvas as well.<p>Low level: well yeah, it's a thin layer over a bitmap surface.  Libraries are needed to abstract away from that.  It's kind of like saying that OpenGL isn't fast because it's core is low-level.  That low-level feature-set Canvas has will be wrapped in libraries to make specific uses simpler, I guarantee it.  Speed will come, especially as Canvas gains focus.  It's still very new.  Was Flash this fast/capable in pre-1.0 days?  I have no idea if it'll catch up / surpass Flash, but it's far from its optimum right now.<p>I'm not calling for the death of Flash, and I seriously doubt it'll ever supersede Flash on everything, so Flash has it's uses and will continue to do so.  Just pointing out that they're not on equal playing grounds in terms of development.",1268319665

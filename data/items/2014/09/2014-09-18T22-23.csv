8338142,comment,8335669,8337930,3,0,iconicaapl,,,"Lots actually. MMS is hard - multiple devices with no consistency, different interconnect gateways that can mangle messages along the way. An easy to use, reliable and pervasive MMS gateway isn&#x27;t as easy to implement as some might think and the carriers haven&#x27;t made it a priority. In fact the US carriers completely messed up their early MMS implementations with Washington-style regulation that made the user experience beyond horrible. Here&#x27;s hoping Twilio makes some progress with this and I wish them much success.<p>EDIT: I realized that I didn&#x27;t actually answer your question. MMS can be supported by carriers in different ways but the most typical interface is MM7 which is SOAP over HTTP. There are many MM7 gateway vendors and they all handle MIME boundaries, payloads, transcoding, etc different - subtle differences, but enough to make testing against a large matrix of devices very, very hard.",1411081096

The Notes need to be structured right, I agree with Mark on this.<p>If you do not have a cap, you are screwing your investors = this is very bad. You should treat your investors well and with respect. They will help you to grow the company.<p>If you have a cap that is too high, it will look bad in later rounds. Set the cap with current market.<p>If you have any control, liquidation terms in your Note = this is insane. The whole point is not to negotiate these terms when your company is just getting started. The Note should convert into the future Preferred Stock with all the rights that will be negotiated later by the VCs on angel investors&#x27; behalf. This is only fair for angel investors.<p>The Convertible Notes can cause all sorts of problems, sure. But the biggest point is that taking money is never free. I don&#x27;t think Convertible Notes will cause more problems that Priced Seed Rounds. I actually think they cause less problems. Witness YC financing = version of Convertible Notes.",1411081044

8338134,comment,8337460,8337735,8,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Progress in physical things hasn&#x27;t slowed since the 1970s, we just don&#x27;t have the same low hanging fruit, especially in the realm of going from nothing to something.<p>The automobile has changed as much in the last 20 years as in the previous 100. Ubiquitous embedded computing has transformed essentially everything, especially manufacturing. Hell, there&#x27;s even a new flurry of innovation in spaceflight, with a very high chance that we&#x27;ll see Martian colonies in the next few decades. That alone is nothing to sneeze at.<p>But let me take a moment to drill down on one specific thing: pollution. In the mid-20th century pollution and abuse of the environment in the developed world was becoming a very serious, even existential problem. Ocean dumping was ubiquitous. Millions of deaths per year were occurring due to the sad state of air quality in major cities like LA, Pittsburgh, London, etc. There were disastrous individual events like the great smog of London in 1952. Many people aren&#x27;t aware that that event killed more people than 9/11, that&#x27;s how serious it was. It also made over 100k people seriously ill, aside from the impact it had on quality of life for people living in London in general. Since then there has been a massive uptick in the population of Los Angeles, there has been a massive increase in car ownership and total vehicle-miles driven, a massive increase in freight volumes on railroads and trucks. And yet, despite all that there has been an even more massive improvement in air quality, enabled by technological innovation.<p>There are many, many more amazing stories along the same lines, with the cornerstone in every case being technology developed in the late 20th century as an enabling factor.<p>One of the downsides of technology that works so well and so smoothly (which late 20th/early 21st century automobiles would fall in the category of) is that it can be difficult to garner the attention it deserves. Smooth functioning is the absence of problems, so it becomes too easy to simply set the baseline at the point where the technology is working (taking it for granted). But these amazing technologies (automobiles, the internet, etc.) are the product of herculean amounts of effort from an enormous number of incredibly skilled people. It should be amazing that we have handheld computers with wireless internet connectivity at broadband speeds, yet this is just the normal state of being in the developed world these days.",1411080945

Studies like this are a waste of time.<p>I realise this is just a study and the whole point might be to highlight issues with school curriculum and have no sexist undertones, but at the same time, studies like this are relatively useless. The modern school system being completely broken to the point kids are falling behind is a very well known fact, and sadly, no study is going to change that anytime soon.<p>Maybe if we had less studies and more action on fixing things, then there wouldn&#x27;t be instances of boys getting left behind in the schooling system. Did it ever occur to those responsible for this study that maybe, just maybe, the system is actually broken? And maybe, just maybe, it has nothing to do with what sex you are? I feel like society already has enough issues when it comes to rampant sexism and gender equality without more fuel being thrown on the fire. All studies like this do is take a handful of people, average and collate the results and then proclaim they&#x27;ve made some kind of conclusive discovery that applies to everyone outside of the sample group. Unless this study leads to change or another longer and more conclusive study, the results mean nothing.<p>Regardless of what sex you are, nobody should be getting left behind. If it is true that boys learn differently to girls, then adjust the curriculum to make it more flexible for different learning styles. When I went to school I struggled, not because I am stupid or because I am a male, I struggled because the curriculum assumed everyone learns the same way and when I couldn&#x27;t fit myself within the mould, I got left behind and taught myself everything I needed to know. Everyone learns differently, we are not all the same.<p>Sorry for getting worked up, Studies like this do nothing to help resolve gender equality gaps whatsoever.",1411080314

String is very much in the &quot;leave data alone&quot; mindset, baring its guts as a [Char]. Now you&#x27;re stuck: you can&#x27;t change its representation, you can&#x27;t easily introduce Unicode, etc. This proved to be so rigid that an entirely new string type had to be introduced, and we&#x27;re still dealing with the fallout.<p>Great and growable systems! The large scale structure of our software, decomposed into modules, not just at a moment frozen in time, but in the future as well. We are tasked with thinking about relationships and communication.<p>So here is how &quot;the better way&quot; is introduced:<p>> Data is immutable, and any complex data structure...<p>There&#x27;s that insidious FP bias: to immediately dive into data structures, to view all programs as a self-contained data transformation. So reductionist! It&#x27;s completely focused on those &quot;internal properties and behaviors&quot; that we were warned about above.<p>I would end here, but I just couldn&#x27;t pass this up:<p>> To come up with a better solution [for dispatching], Haskell and Clojure take very different approaches, but both excel what any OO programmer is commonly used to.<p>&quot;Any OO programmer?&quot; No way! OO as realized in truly dynamic languages exposes not just a fixed dispatch mechanism, but the machinery of dispatch itself, i.e. a metaobject protocol:<p><i>&quot;...there are not only classes for workaday tools, such as UI widgets, but there are also classes that represent the metastructure of the system itself. How are instances themselves made? What is a variable really? Can we easily install a very different notion of inheritance? Can we decide that prototypes are going to work better for us than classes, and move to a prototype-based design?&quot;</i><p>This is far richer than the anemic switch-style dispatch that Haskell&#x27;s guards and pattern matching provide. For example, try modifying a Haskell program to print a log every time a string is made. You can&#x27;t!<p>I&#x27;m not familiar with Clojure but I&#x27;ll bet its object model has its roots in CLOS.

Forget the exact way the type system works, or what extension methods are, or even what polymorphism is.<p>The big advantage of OO is that it acts as a distillation of how humans think.  We&#x27;re accustomed to thinking in terms of &#x27;things that do stuff&#x27;.  What OO provides is essentially a skeuomorphic element to your code, where your basic units have some resemblance to real items and concepts.  This makes it a lot easier to reason about large codebases, and makes them easier to document (in theory).  It means the most important thing you need to understand how a piece of business logic works is knowledge of the business.  You don&#x27;t need to know anything about the data, or how the application is composed in order to comply with the needed use case.  If you know the concepts and their behaviour in the problem domain, you will be able to make sense of how the code is written.<p>FP has its place, as does procedural code, but advocating either of them as a complete replacement for OO is short-sighted. Claiming FP is a solution to OO&#x27;s shortcomings is too.  Each has its place.

I had the same opinions, because it doesn&#x27;t really feal like rocket science or flying cars. A German professor called Peter Kruse, changed my mind. He has a really interesting perspective on todays interconectedness using a system theroetical view:<p>His thesis is (roughly):\nWhat we are currently doing is rapidly increasing the interconnectedness or the networking density of our society almost worldwide (e.g. social networks Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, you name it) and the devices we use (e.g. IoT), we have also increased spontaneous activities in these networks (e.g. web 2.0 services where people can be interactive), additionally we have implemented functions that enable circular stimulus in these networks (retweet and share functions). If these 3 effects come together there is the tendency that these systems will carry signals that resonate and amplify themselfs. It is almost impossible to forecast when and how this happens, because these networks are non-linear. If you post something that resonates with a lot of people you can be very powerful from one moment to another. Technology is only the enabler here and I have no doubt that this has a huge impact on society - see the revolution in Egypt for example. One outcome is a shift of power, because it is really hard to control these networks. Even though we have very sophisticated mass-surveilance most events happen very uncontrolled.",1411078791

First, have you seen what real-world large-scale OO looks like? Dude, it ain&#x27;t pretty. We&#x27;re swimming in projects that are staffed at 10x or 20x the number of coders they probably really need, and a lot of time is spent in support activities.<p>Second, maybe the real question here isn&#x27;t one of scale, it&#x27;s how the model falls apart under strain. A good encapsulated system should offer you a bit more defensive programming protection than an FP one. But if you&#x27;re using compsable executables, while testing at the O/S level? Meh.<p>I know why we went to OO. And let&#x27;s not forget OOAD, a beautiful way of joining analysis and design about the problem with the solution itself. I&#x27;m of a mind that OOAD might live on even once the world moves to mostly FP.<p>I think maybe that OOP was a stopgap position; a place to try to build a firewall against the encroaching overstaffing associated with Mythical Man-Month management. Now that programming is a commodity, however, we&#x27;re seeing diminishing returns. Don&#x27;t know.<p>I am much less convinced of the &quot;We need OO for large scale projects&quot; argument now than I was two years ago. I expect this trend to continue. We might be able to solve the scaling problem with things like cyclomatic complexity limits on executables, or DSL standards.

The sameness of the existing UK political parties is not because of some broken voting system or the &quot;Westminster Elite&quot;. It&#x27;s because the Labour and Conservative parties traditionally differentiated themselves on economic policy, and the hard left economics of old Labour lost the battle of ideas so thoroughly that it took Blair&#x27;s &quot;New Labour&quot; movement to make them electable again. Ever since, the UK has been stuck with:<p>1. The Tories, who have a nasty authoritarian streak and represent the worst of the old British class system but post-Thatcher have a reputation for managing the economy well and  are at least willing to be honest with voters about financial reality.<p>2. Labour, who have been trying and largely failing to find a new political identity after socialist/communist policies like strong trade union support became indelibly associated with economic failure.<p>3. Lib Dems who also lack any obvious political identity and never really expected to win anyway, they always represented the protest vote. When they accidentally ended up winning votes in the general disgust with both Labour and Tories in 2010 they had to enter coalition and immediately realised their promises to voters were unimplementable.<p>So three parties, none of which want to rewind the country to the disaster of the 1970&#x27;s and thus struggle to differentiate themselves from the Tories. Oh, there&#x27;s also UKIP which at least is differentiated, the problem is lots of people think their difference is for the worse.<p>Result of all that is the &quot;neoliberal consensus&quot; Scots and other people in the north hate so much. But this state of affairs is the consensus <i>because</i> the alternative was tried and turned out to be way worse.<p>Everything is made more problematic by the fact that the UK political system and culture expects The Opposition to disagree with everything the government in power does by default. So the last few decades have witnessed both parties repeatedly try to claim the other party is completely wrong whilst actually largely agreeing with each other and doing the same things once in power. This mock disagreement results in a fake, plasticky sort of politics that ends up creating disillusionment.<p>Eventually the UK political scene will change and the parties will find some fundamental difference that divides them once more. Maybe over the issue of Europe. Or, people will get used to the idea that maybe politicians violently disagreeing about extremely basic things isn&#x27;t a healthy or normal state of affairs, and a genteel consensus about the best way forward is actually more civilised.",1411078119

8337909,comment,8335010,8337751,3,0,swift,,,"I&#x27;d really like someone on any side of this debate (and there are certainly more than two; for example, some people are advocates of &quot;FP in the small, OO in the large&quot;) to write an article that <i>does</i> describe how their approach handles the challenges of designing and maintaining a large system.<p>I think such articles are rare because they&#x27;re much harder to write than something like this. In complex systems it becomes very difficult to explain all of the tradeoffs and constraints that have led to the design you&#x27;ve ended up with, and it becomes harder to evaluate that design.<p>FWIW, at this point I agree with the author that modern FP has strong advantages over OO. One reason I feel this way is because extensive experience with large OO systems has shown me lots of ways in which OO causes problems. However, I admit that I don&#x27;t have a similar level of experience with large FP systems. I&#x27;m sure that as FP gets more popular and more large FP systems get built, we&#x27;ll find plenty of things to complain about on that side of the fence too.",1411077804

Irrational fear of new terminology is a major stumbling block to progress. There is a wealth of new things to discover that will require new modes of thinking, new concepts, and new terminology.<p>If devs wish to remain stagnant in their knowledge and their practice, that&#x27;s fine. But in doing so, there&#x27;s no reason why they should offer their opinions on matters they&#x27;ve chosen to ignore. I hope they&#x27;d have the intellectual humility to simply  listen, rather than contribute noise to the discussion.",1411077694

The only options would be to go all in and go to their home country to develop the product further, at which point they&#x27;ve abandoned everything they&#x27;ve worked hard for all this while, - or - wait for a green card, which is elusive if you are from one of the populous Asian countries. What other options does one have? Have any H1s successfully made it to YC? Could they describe their experience?<p>Also, please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong here, but despite assurances from YC folk and Sam himself that you can and should apply even if you have just an idea or prototype, blog after blog suggest you need to be much further than that to get through the tough competition.",1411077602

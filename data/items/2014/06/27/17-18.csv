7955334,comment,7954944,7954944,20,0,JoshTriplett,,,"Personally, I find it painful that the compiler detects this kind of undefined behavior, and silently uses it for optimization, rather then stopping and emitting an error.  In the printf example, the compiler could trivially emit an error saying &quot;NULL check on p after dereference of p&quot;, and that would catch a large class of bugs.  (Some static analysis tools check for exactly that.)  Similarly, a loop access statically determined to fall outside the bounds of the array should produce an error.",1403891921

7955330,comment,7954944,7955289,16,0,dkersten,,,"The first example took me a few reads to get too.<p>Basically, since <i>i=4</i> causes undefined behaviour, the compiler assumes that it can&#x27;t possibly happen[1] and the only way that it can&#x27;t happen is if one of the prior (i < 4) checks were true.<p>Therefore all legal code paths (ie all code paths that don&#x27;t result in undefined behaviour) return true.<p>So it optimises it to simply return true. Because otherwise i=4 would have happened, but that&#x27;s undefined, so impossible[1]<p>[1] but if it does happen, that&#x27;s ok, because that would be undefined behaviour, which allows the compiler to do whatever it feels like anyway",1403891843
7955329,comment,7954069,7955175,2,0,Buckleyisms,,,"> I have no idea what the right thing to do is in this situation, but having all those possibilities gives the compiler a better chance of producing faster code. When you introduce message passing, you basically forbid all of those optimizations, because now the function might be swizzled, go pass a &quot;minX:Y:&quot; string to objcMsgSend to find out what pointer we should jump to today.<p>> Swift already does have a way to opt-in to message passing, it&#x27;s called the @objc flag (and performSelector:). It works fine, but it&#x27;s extra work to opt into it and use it. But, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s bad given that it disables so many useful optimizations.<p>You could keep some of these optimizations if Swift&#x27;s message-passing mechanism preserved type information. This would make it slower than objc_msgSend, but you could still keep a lot of cool optimizations. Some optimizations would still not be possible, and extensive use of function pointers does tend to frustrate branch prediction, but I feel that for most apps, this would be fast enough.<p>> Finally, I fundamentally and strongly disagree with Michael about method swizzling and OSX extensibility. Adding PGP to Mail via hooking functions sounds like an incredibly deranged idea. The suggestion that programs should cooperate with a badly-misguided reverse engineering effort by disabling optimizations that make the program faster for the other 99% is just insane. The way to approach this is to build new kinds of extensions that provide known, safe, documented extension entrypoints for hooking arbitrary code. Yes that is more work, and yes it requires actually talking with people and convincing them of your point of view, but so do most things.<p>I think this is a great argument, but unfortunately it&#x27;s not where OS X is today. As I mentioned, app extensions may be a step towards a more workable solution, but today, the ability to add PGP to mail using method swizzling is important to thousands of Mail.app users. If 10.11 comes out and Mail.app has been rewritten in Swift before we have a good alternative to method swizzling, we&#x27;ll have lost a lot of tools that make the Mac a powerful platform.",1403891843

7955323,comment,7954069,7955200,1,0,hamstergene,,,"You may not realize it, but it looks to me you are. The points you criticize Swift for are distinctive features of dynamic languages, e.g. to be able to:<p>* substitute object type without recreating the object<p>* substitute object&#x27;s method without changing object&#x27;s type<p>* create a string with method name and call that method<p>Obj-C and most dynamic languages have them; Swift and languages like C++ do not. (I understand that with full reflection and enough runtime hacking static languages can have that too — by the way, that includes Swift as it currently is; but that&#x27;s a whole different discussion).<p>In other words: if the compiler has statically (at compile time) validated types of arguments and return values of any `obj.foo(arg)` call, why would anyone possibly want anything but either a direct call to a hardcoded address, or to a pointer stored at vtable? And if the compiler has no means to validate that, that means you are down to what dynamic languages do: there has to be some code to check argument types before passing them to the code that makes hard assumptions about their types.",1403891799

7955175,comment,7954069,7954069,3,0,drewcrawford,,,"So I&#x27;ve actually been doing a lot of thinking about this, because I have a use case that doesn&#x27;t work as well as in Swift.<p>You have some problems. The first problem you have, is that static compilation provides so many routes for cross-applicaton optimization that this is one of the major ways that Swift can be faster than its predecessors.  For example, if you have this<p><pre><code>    func min<T: Comparable>(x: T, y: T) -> T {  //Generic functions\n        if x < y {\n            return y\n        \n        return x\n    }\n\n    min(3,5)\n\n    min(5.0,2.0)\n</code></pre>\nThe compiler has a lot of possibilities.  For example it could translate this function very literally, producing the generic min function that you wrote.  It could realize that you only use this for floats and ints, and emit 2 particular specializations of the min function.  It could specialize the float function and use the generic function for ints, or vice versa.  Next, it could inline any of these, none of them, or some of them.  Finally it could do three different things depending on if you&#x27;re x86-64, armv7s, or arm64.<p>I have no idea what the right thing to do is  in this situation, but having all those possibilities gives the compiler a better chance of producing faster code.  When you introduce message passing, you basically forbid all of those optimizations, because now the function might be swizzled, go pass a &quot;minX:Y:&quot; string to objcMsgSend to find out what pointer we should jump to today.<p>Swift already does have a way to opt-in to message passing, it&#x27;s called the @objc flag (and performSelector:).  It works fine, but it&#x27;s extra work to opt into it and use it.  But, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s bad given that it disables so many useful optimizations.<p>What may be bad is that the name &quot;@objc&quot; is a dead giveaway that this is a feature with a deprecation date.    So I think we need some other, reflectionish system going forward.<p>For mocks one idea would be to selectively turn on message-passing as the dispatch method at the compiler level.  So you could compile your application for unit testing with a &quot;-fmessage-passing&quot; like we have &quot;-fobjc-no-arc&quot; and get all the dynamism in debug builds and turn them off for release builds (or not, as the case may be).<p>For everyday power programming I think the answer is a lot simpler: functions are first-class objects in Swift, so just take your functions, put them in a dictionary somewhere and implement your own run-time dispatch.  Having done this, I can say with certainty that there are some ways the language could improve this use case but it is possible, and if you are Chris Espinosa wrestling a bit with the type system is not a problem.<p>Things are tricky when you don&#x27;t have the source code, but here again I see a reflection-ish API as being the key.  I expect at some point we will be able to enumerate other classes&#x27; public methods, and dynamically dispatch into them, and that is certainly a missing feature with valid use cases.<p>Finally, I fundamentally and strongly disagree with Michael about method swizzling and OSX extensibility.  Adding PGP to Mail via hooking functions sounds like an incredibly deranged idea.  The suggestion that programs should cooperate with a badly-misguided reverse engineering effort by disabling optimizations that make the program faster for the other 99% is just insane.  The way to approach this is to build new kinds of extensions that provide known, safe, documented extension entrypoints for hooking arbitrary code. Yes that is more work, and yes it requires actually talking with people and convincing them of your point of view, but so do most things.",1403890299

Swift is not going to replace the optimized C and C++ code, especially for the really low-level stuff.<p>But even if Apple does decide to rewrite all the Core* frameworks et. al. with Swift, there&#x27;s still an argument that Swift should use message passing by default, and a way to opt in to vtable and direct dispatch for performance-critical code. For higher-level apps, message-passing is a lot less useful if it&#x27;s opt-in.<p>As for the IRC and Latin conjugation, yes, those problems can be solved in other ways, but those other ways involve more (mostly glue) code.

Usually, it&#x27;s best to really get to know your market really well first, before reaching for funding.<p>Second, make sure your legal documents are in order. Incorporate, if you haven&#x27;t already, and open up a business bank account. Make sure to use your business bank account for all business related expenses. This will make accounting much easier down the line.<p>Third, hire a great bookkeeper.

Open source projects are heavily dependent on electronic communication (mailing lists, forums, etc.) for everything from feature planning to user feedback, but what all of those mediums have in common is that people are 100x more likely to post that they hate than that they like something. So, it really is true that no matter what you do or don&#x27;t do, seemingly everyone on the Internet is going to hate it, when in fact that&#x27;s just a very vocal minority.<p>Point being, even GNOME 3 (or Unity...) levels of vocal online user hate don&#x27;t necessarily mean that a meaningful percentage of the user base actually dislikes the changes. Feedback should always be read and reflected on, just not followed slavishly. If you just try to avoid Internet hate from users, you&#x27;ll never change anything, and even that philosophy will garner you a continuous stream of heated forum posts about how nothing ever changes.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like reading Yelp reviews. In the aggregate, they help some places stand out from the crowd, but they&#x27;re still not any sort of objective judgement on the place being reviewed. You always have to think about where the reviewer is coming from and take that into account. For example, dumbasses who go to some incredibly popular and trendy restaraunt at 7:30pm on Friday without reservations, and then post negative reviews because they had to wait too long for a table. Well, duh. In the software world, the equivalent would be complaints about a piece of software not being just like X (where X could be a previous version, or some competitor), when in fact your entire goal is to create something unlike X. If someone wants X and you&#x27;re making Y, then have to take &quot;Y sucks because it&#x27;s not X!&quot; complaints with a massive grain of salt. It still doesn&#x27;t mean you ignore those complaints (maybe Y was a bad idea?), but you wouldn&#x27;t be doing anyone any favors by doing the most common Open Source thing, which would be to either say, &quot;oh well, I guess we&#x27;ll stop making Y and just make another X instead&quot;, or (even worse, and sadly even more common), &quot;I know, we&#x27;ll make everyone happy by making something that&#x27;s both an X and a Y!

I often go back and look at discussions on old pull requests to figure out why we decided to do something one way or another. It&#x27;s even &quot;higher resolution&quot; than commit messages (which should <i>also</i> be good).",1403888423

C is replaced with swift&#x27;s functional core.  Switching all dispatch to message passing would destroy this benefit and push more development back into C.<p>The case of the Latin Conjugation, and the IRC client are terrible reasons for using message passing.  Both are trivially solved with data structures and closures.  It seems that the author has little experience with functional programming, and just wants to stick with Objective-C.<p>I&#x27;m not against message passing - I just think that Swift gets the balance right, and it would take a much stronger argument than this to justify message passing everywhere.",1403888415

7891834,comment,7889637,7889997,2,0,wyager,,,"> Every major language has Regex support, often built-in<p>That&#x27;s a very bold statement. My most commonly used languages (Haskell, Rust, Go, C, and C++) do not have regex support built in. I don&#x27;t think any of them even have regex support in their standard library.<p>>I&#x27;d assume that a large percentage of programs employs Regexes somewhere<p>I think that would be incorrect. I&#x27;ve never used a regex in a production program. In fact, the only time I ever use regexes is when I&#x27;m scraping data or doing searches, and that certainly doesn&#x27;t account for &quot;a large percentage of programs&quot;.<p>A large percentage of programs also use URL fetching, but that&#x27;s not a good reason to make URL fetching part of the core language.",1402711160

Let&#x27;s pretend that we compare the set of all worldlines where country A goes to war with itself to the set of all worldlines where it does not. The variance within each of those sets is going to be enormous with regard to the relative rates of progress.<p>Another thing to consider is that in the case of a civil war we could simply treat the two parties as distinct states for the purpose of analysis. Yes, there will be some peculiarities such as supposedly being governed by the same set of laws, however if we take only the United States and France as examples, the factions that ultimately developed basically lived under two (or more) distinct sets of laws. I say this because in the US federalism was much weaker before 1865 and in France the class system divided the population and the difference in the treatment of different classes under the law has been argued to be one of the key factors contributing to 1789 (see Tocqueville).",1402710649

It is totally conceivable that taking a huge short position and scaring everyone off of btc could mean more profit than the could be mined out of those rigs.  Of course, you would need someone to take the other side of that bet, in a setting with sufficiently little counterparty risk that you can collect (which typically means a more regulated setting) and a sufficiently lax regulatory environment that you aren&#x27;t likely to be accused of some illegal type of market manipulation.

I have pretty much made peace with the fact that I am going to be fundamentally miserable for most if not all of my life.<p>The reason why that is, is because even though I never do things just because others want me to do them[2], I am still very much driven by success and achievement. Not because society compels me to achieve, but because there is an internal drive that just will not shut up. Kundera explained it well in Lightness of Being - there is an inner voice that says you <i>have to</i>. You <i>must</i>. Even though you know full well following this path does not make you happy, moving away from that voice makes you even more miserable. Just because you&#x27;re not following your talents/gifts[3].<p>When it comes to success vs. failure. Succeeding brings with it doubts in terms of whether you&#x27;re succeeding rapidly enough, whether there&#x27;s more you could be doing, whether your goals are high enough. When you&#x27;re failing, you&#x27;re failing and failing never feels good.<p>And there&#x27;s nothing that even compares to the emptiness that comes when you achieve a goal. It&#x27;s soul crushing. All that work and now you&#x27;re done ... what can you possibly do with your life now? What else is there? What&#x27;s the next step? If I could achieve this goal, was it even lofty enough?<p>In the end, I&#x27;ve learned to simply manage my depression and live with it.<p>[1] I think I fall in the camp, it&#x27;s hard to say, I&#x27;ve never achieved much that the outside world would laud me for, but I tend to behave like achievers do and have been obsessed with success/achievement ever since I can remember<p>[2] ask anyone, I am impossible to motivate externally.

It is like 1/3 of South Korea&#x27;s economy, but its not a true comparable because it functions more like a keiretsu [0]. At it&#x27;s core, it&#x27;s a bank that finances many companies operating in different industries that cooperate when it makes sense. They are a giant in computing, but they also draw a ton of strength from other lines of business. For example, Samsung Heavy Industries is one of the biggest builders of large cargo container ships in the world. There are many more lines of business like this.<p>On that note, one reason for Apple&#x27;s ability to deliver a 9/10 experience with a closed ecosystem is because it can afford to. There would be a lot more companies able to deliver a 9 out of 10 closed experience if they had the cash reserves Apple does. Cash funds the development of perfected services, but more importantly it affords Apple&#x27;s leadership the luxury to focus on the long-term. When cash is an issue, companies have to make trade-offs that compromise on building the foundation to get to a 9 out of 10 experience. Apple never has to compromise. They just need to make sure there is a market and then build out the foundational layers of the onion necessary to build a unified experience including complementary products and services that make the difference between a 7 out of 10 experience and a 9 out of 10 experience.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiretsu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiretsu</a>",1402709750

My story is in the last two posts here:<p><a href=""http://diffle-history.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://diffle-history.blogspot.com/</a><p>Basically, I sucked it up, felt depressed and aimless for about 3 months, and then went and got a job at Google and moved out to California.  Had a very successful 5+ year career there where I generally felt that my startup experience was an advantage, although there were definitely a few moments where I thought &quot;I wish I&#x27;d joined Google in 2005 instead of wasting 4 years with this startup dream.&quot;  Such is life though - I remember talking to a Google coworker (who later become a 2-time YC founder with a successful exit) who said &quot;Dude, pretty much everyone at Google wishes they joined 4 years earlier.&quot;  Now gearing up to try it all again.<p>I suspect that a major factor that accounted for that was that I founded my startup thinking it was an experiment and not a goal - I needed to <i>know</i>, myself, what I was capable of.  If the answer was &quot;Not founding a company, apparently&quot;, well, then I had my answer, and I could be happy in a regular company.  If the answer was &quot;You&#x27;re rich now&quot;, well, so much the better.  At no point did I feel I <i>had</i> to get rich, or that it was my destiny, or that I was worthless if I didn&#x27;t succeed.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen some of the posts you mention that describe how years spent on a failed startup do not improve their career options, and the thing that&#x27;s jumped out about most of them is that the founders there founded a company to <i>escape</i> having a real job, and then continued working on it long past the point where it would be rational to quit and do something else.  Of course that&#x27;ll hurt your prospects - you are losing time that can be spent developing skills and working on projects that actually will have an impact, and it also shows that you&#x27;re not entirely rational.  I also know a number of startup founders who tried it, realized their business concept was flawed (or in some, it was even successful but they just didn&#x27;t want to do it anymore), and then went to work for Google.  You typically don&#x27;t hear about them on Hacker News, however, because they close that chapter of their life and feel no need to dwell on it and no bitterness to it, and so they don&#x27;t post.",1402709585

Given the recent cataloging of trillions of new worldlines with the advent of our new transworldline sensing technology, we set out to search for the ideal ‘natural’ experiment: two world lines, one where a country was at war, and one where it was not. We initially found practically countless potential pairings, so with high hopes we entered the second phase of our research program. To our great dismay, as we began to filter through potential world lines for a situation where a single country was at war and not at war, we stumbled upon a serious problem--we could find no perfect control! Whenever one country switched from a state of war to another, so did some second country as well!<p>To make a long story short, despite having direct access to countless possible worldlines, we have been unsuccessful in answering our fundamental question. The state of war and the state of peace, while often considered duals, are in reality ahistorical names we give to the states of societies that come about by long, path dependent processes. We would attempt to account for the interaction effects between society and environment, however our colleagues working in Evolution and Transtemporal studies inform us that they remain decades, if not centuries away from having tools to answer such questions, and they have had a four century head start developing their tools.<p>We believe that these results would be of interest to researchers and policy makers across the multiverse.<p>END TRANSMISSION----<p>tl;dr You can’t possibly measure this.",1402708941

You buy into Apple&#x27;s ecosystem and you do Apple-y things and you&#x27;ll have a world class experience, a 9 or 10 on a 10 point scale.<p>But as soon as you start interfacing with anything else, especially something messy like the Internet, and hold onto your pants because you have no idea what the experience is going to be like, but you can guarantee it won&#x27;t be better than a 5 out of 10 at best.<p>As much as other companies might like to provide an Apple-like walled garden (and I&#x27;ll completely agree that previous attempts by non-Apples have been 3 out of 10s at best), they fundamentally understand that there is a bigger world out there. It&#x27;s much harder to interface with the rest of the world, it <i>is</i> messy, but you can bring some kind of sanity to it if you work at it. These companies work really hard to provide a 7 or 8 out of 10 experience while Apple provides a 5. And they&#x27;re rewarded for it. They hit these perfectly reasonable experience levels in-spite of the underlying mess they have to deal with, and they manage to make viable businesses out of it. What&#x27;s more remarkable to me is that despite Apple controlling 100% of the experience in the Apple ecosystem, they aren&#x27;t a perfect 10.<p>I think this magnifies the flaws even more and makes them more damning and I think a surprising amount of it backfires. Otherwise Apple would absolutely dominate the market, but it doesn&#x27;t.<p>Where Apple <i>does</i> talk to the outside world, it&#x27;s an acknowledgment that it&#x27;s simply cheaper to deliver content through proprietary end-to-end points over the Internet rather than build the infrastructure themselves. But it&#x27;s such a begrudging acknowledgment and the result is a collective &quot;meh&quot; out of Apple. &quot;It&#x27;s not part of us, so why really try?&quot; Make no mistake, if Apple could replace Internet connectivity with a global AppleTalk network to deliver music and videos to you and ensure no unclean non-Apple users weren&#x27;t dirtying up the bandwidth, they would.<p>The goal of other companies then is to try to hit the <i>feel</i> of this kind of tight vertical integration that Apple has, but to do it across vendors, networks, software, etc...to do it in a non-integrated way. And you know what? It&#x27;s not bad. It&#x27;s not Apple-level, but you have to admit the Internet, the Web, etc. all that is pretty bad ass. These things that we take for granted are the result of a decidedly non-Apple, very open, approach that benefits people far more in the balance.<p>>Apple is second to last in that respect. Google and Amazon both understand the web a whole heck of a lot better than Apple. Only Samsung understands the web less than Apple.<p>Then again, Samsung and Apple are two of the largest companies in the world. So maybe they&#x27;re doing something right.",1402708367

Plus, iTunes Radio (which didn&#x27;t get much love from Apple) already had more people than Spotify (almost twice as much).<p>><i>As for speed, I would be very surprised if Apple had better service than Google or Amazon, as these companies are much more invested in the Web than Apple.</i><p>It&#x27;s not like that it takes anything special to get speed on the web. It&#x27;s not rocket science. Apple uses Azure for a lot of its services, which is equivalent to AWS/Amazon.",1402707733

That statement makes no sense at all.<p>There are about 75 character per line, that’s pretty much the sweet spot for characters per line. Going for a few more characters would be ok (120 is a usual guideline for the maximum), but 75 is pretty good. It’s actually pretty much the standard. I learned 60 to 90 characters per line.<p>Margins are your problem. Your browser is too wide. (I agree that the font is much too small. Also, Verdana is seriously ugly. A better font at a larger size would reduce the size of your margins, even if you are one of those strange fullscreen browser people.)",1402707729

I&#x27;m not sure it completely explains the higher weight divisions though, since if you look at the rate at which the heavier fighters get tired and start lowering their guard, it&#x27;s much higher than in the lower weight divisions, leaving them more susceptible to the KO/TKO.",1402707660

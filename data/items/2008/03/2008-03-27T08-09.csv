They could even snap into one another to form one huge, seamless slab. Of course, you'd need something a little more advanced than even remote X server/client sessions to get it to work, because someone might want to ""tear off"" an application in one corner and take it with them to the bathroom, behind a lead wall for some reason.",1206608391

Just a suggestion, why not just have comments under the video, scrolling up in sync, because most of the comments don't need to be on the video itself.",1206608210

It's not going to be touched unless someone's coming in, and they'll usually <i>start</i> to close it before they step inside. That is, if it is closed by default. Open by default might be harder.",1206608024
147657,comment,147601,147609,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"e1ven is spot on.  You can't screw around starting a business with indeterminate revenue potential if you have dependents.  You need to have a years worth of frugal living expenses in the bank (including paying for health insurance out of pocket) before taking that kind of risk.<p>Work on your business part-time, or put in some extra hours at work to increase your rate of saving for the eventual day when you can quit.  It is possible to build a business part-time.  It's harder, the odds are stacked even higher against you, and you get a lot less done.  But you get to keep your family fed and your health/retirement benefits in place and working for you.<p>pg covered this in his ""Why not start a startup"" talk.  Every reason except ""you have a family to support"" he debunks.  This is the one that can't be debunked, because starting a business is not guaranteed.  It could take months or even years to start seeing revenue, if you ever see revenue.  A few grand from YC only makes a few months difference, tops, in the ""when do I run out of money"" equation.  If you aren't already quite confident you have the money in the bank to last until you can make your business pay or at least be sure it's not going to and you can feel good about going to work at a regular job, you aren't in a position to take that risk.",1206607958

Okay, so moral is if you document your code create useful libraries you can save a lot of code from turning useless<p>I can also see, that in most work places expecially in IT departments of non IT organizations many still don't use a single repository for their code or document their code and projects, this is why many code just die when the employee who wrote it leave",1206607865
147655,comment,146604,146604,0,0,demallien,,,"As others have noted, the problem was always going to have to be solved at some point.  So no, TechCrunch should not modify its current behaviour.<p>I have my own theory for how to solve this problem.  You start off by putting on a filter - all comments with less than 5 points are hidden from users unless they specifically ask for them to be seen.<p>Each post, when first posted, automatically has a +5 modifier, so it gets seen.  But a post is reduced by one point after 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 hours.  If you have received a few positive votes, your comment will stay up, but if others feel that it is repetitive, or doesn't have any interesting comment, it will disappear after a while.<p>Those time values may need to change dynamically to be more rapid for heavy traffic threads.<p>The other thing to fix it is to really encourage people to actually give votes for EVERY post that they find worthwhile.  This imncreases the amount of feedback in the system.  Perhaps there should be a quick three to four sentence guide to voting at the top of every YC News page?<p>Anyway, that's what I came up with after many years of frustration with slashdot...",1206607826

147653,comment,147557,147557,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've been using eMusic for years, and absolutely love it (I think it was #2 for quite a while).  But now that Amazon offers DRM-free MP3s that I can play on my Linux boxes, I'll use it for major label stuff that I can't get from eMusic.  It's pretty rare that I have the urge for mainstream stuff...but it does happen.  Their prices are reasonable, as well.  Nothing to complain about, actually.<p>But, I certainly won't be letting my eMusic subscription lapse.",1206607227

147649,comment,147124,147213,0,0,demallien,,,"Exactly.  It's a bit like Blub in the database space.  Sure, you can do anything in a relational database, but there are certain problems that are better handled other ways.<p>Relational databases have been optimised to do a certain task very well: retrieve information very rapidly from a large dataset, that has well-defined, relatively static, relationships between entities.  They were designed for things such as storing government census data, tracking customer details for very large corporations, insurance data etc etc.  You may like to think of relational databases as being the C equivalent in the database space: relatively low-level, fast.<p>But there is a new type of database out there.  It is more human in it's scale, with tables that might only have thousands, rather than millions, of entries.  But the data has very fluid relationships between entities: Hank's example in the comments here about wanting to track a contact's favourite restaurant is a classic example.  We might also want to track the contact's favourite film, their car model, and where they last went for their holidays.  A bit later we may also consider it really important to know what brand of dishwashing detergent they use.<p>This sort of problem is not well handled by relational databases.  They aren't optimised for it.  They are optimised for speed over large datasets with static relationships.  To get fluid relationships, you need to use join tables, which have a large size cost, and which degrade the reliability of the database.
But speed is not typically a problem for these types of problems.  There are lots and lots of small tables, instead of a few large tables.  Manually examining every item in the table to find one that matches your criteria is not necessarily a prohibitively expensive operation.<p>Thinking about this kind of problem from a Rails perspective, for example, you might decide to modify ActiveRecord such that its has_one, belongs_to style declarators, instead of working on static fields in a table, instead attack one table for the object, containing a bunch of tuples that look like {""relationship_name"", table_id, [item_id1, item_id2,...]}  Operations on the relationships between objects modifies this table, rather than the actual tables that contain object information.  As such, the structure of links between tables becomes just another table.  It wouldn't be as fast as a relational database, but for this type of task, it is far better suited, as it would be far more expressive - a new relationship between objects can be created just by inserting a new row into the table, and is hence modifiable programatically.  It's the lisp of the database world.",1206606885

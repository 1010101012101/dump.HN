560213,comment,559814,560177,0,0,sho,,,"<i>""A higher rate of return on the endowment fund is directly and obviously connected to higher spending on the university's academic aims.""</i><p>Well yes, but where do you draw the line? At what point does an endowment become a safe, constant feed from the ROI on donations from students past, and turn into a wealth fund for its own sake? In my opinion, by the time you are paying the university's money managers far, <i>far</i> in excess of what its own academics could ever hope to earn, you have crossed that line.<p>I see parallels here between the Harvard example and, say, the Singapore Government's Temasek Holdings, noted for its aggresive investment strategies with public money.<p><i>""You don't seem to understand the basic idea behind an endowment. ""</i><p>Sorry. I should have written ""at replenishment rates"" or similar. I wasn't thinking.<p><i>""not seeking a competitive return on their endowment would be grossly irresponsible""</i><p>Yeah well, who's irresponsible now? What do they say to someone who reached deep and gave a hundred K or so to express their thanks and hope to guarantee the university's future academic service? Oops, we just lost 80,000 times your donation through irresponsible speculation, can we have some more please?<p>I understand your points, and can agree to some extent, but I can't help but think they went <i>way</i> too far. I must admit my thinking is probably shaped by coming from a country where universities are considered public institutions and these endowments are almost unheard-of, so my comments probably lack nuance in the American context.<p>In fact, I find the whole thing vaguely obscene. Harvard sounds like a huge, voracious hedge fund with a small side business of maybe running a university with some of the profits. How can such a thing be? What is their charter? What if they bought up smaller universities and closed them down? Isn't that within their interest, too? Should we allow them this kind of power? Is it wise to allow academic institutions to focus on wealth creation first, actual education second? Does the success of failure of a university now come down to how well they manage their investments, not the quality of their tuition?<p>I am reminded of some of my qualms with other non-profit groups. World Vision, for example, behaves in what I would say is a similar manner - the vast majority of donations they receive get ploughed straight into fundraising and advertising, in the hope of increasing the next round of donations. While this does make sense in a perverse, narrowly-focused way - they are only trying to get even more money for the children, after all! - the fact remains that their chief activity seems to be hiring ever more people and undertaking ever more overhead to increase their cashflow, and the starving children, etc, are merely the general theme of the never-ending story. I have a deep distrust of these institutions, especially non-profits, whose behavioural aims first and foremost appear to be self-perpetuation and endless growth, while their stated goals upon which their non-profit charter is hitched take a distant second place.<p>Ah well, probably comes down to philosophical differences, like everything seems to. Not really trying to vastly increase the scope of the discussion, just thinking out loud.",1239648090

In both languages you refer to a concrete function by its signature rather than its name. Eg in Haskell you'd have ""(+) :: Int -> Int -> Int"" or ""(+) :: Float -> Float -> Float"". You have this additional way to refer to the abstract version, ""Num a => (+) :: a -> a -> a"" but I don't see how that helps in debugging, other than to simultaneously set breakpoints on all the concrete functions which constitute the abstract method. Also C++0x concepts bring these two frameworks closer together.<p>On the larger issue of free-for-all overloading I mostly agree with you: it causes unnecessary confusion.

560179,comment,558627,558856,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"You said Atheism is <i>a falsifiable hypothesis that fails if anyone presents repeatable, concrete evidence that a higher power exists</i><p>That sounds great, except it isn't.<p>How would somebody go about creating a repeatable falsifiable experiment that showed that there was a God? Try it out in your mind. It just doesn't work.<p>I point to a rock and say ""This rock is God. Therefore you are wrong."" How would you refute such a claim? Point to a rock and say ""No it isn't?"" We easily end up simply contradicting one another.<p>You can't refute a claim about the existence of God without getting into a discussion of the definition of God. Because without a common definition, there's nothing to falsify. You could say ""There is no God according to this definition,"" which is a fair thing to say. If we all shared the same definition, it might even work. But we don't.<p>So I simply pick ""God is some subset of that which cannot currently be proved""<p>We know that there are things in formal systems that are true yet cannot be proved, and we know that throughout history there are things that are true that could not be proved for a long time, so such things exist. Yet because we are unable to attach our grappling hooks of logic and reason to the concept it defies our Popperian paradigm that we would quite reasonably apply to all other things scientific.<p>God is simply a belief that we don't know everything. Under that rubric, of course there is a God.<p>Now is he a big guy in the sky with a beard, etc? Beats me. I think once you establish belief in the unknowable you have to acknowledge that anything past that point is going to be speculation, personal opinion, creative storytelling, etc. Nothing wrong with that, it's just not rational in the same way science is. Your ""falsifiable"" qualification ends where God begins.<p>And that's why atheism is faith-based. It presupposes the existence or access to all facts and methods regarding dealing with God. In that sense it's actually quite more irrational than other religions which continually twist and morph as understanding changes. Atheism will always be the same -- because at it's heart it's always about applying science to dreams: a ludicrous idea at best.",1239647148

Like any big university, Harvard takes endowment money, and invests it in such a way as to maximize returns. Some of those returns are reinvested in the endowment, and the rest are used to support the university. A higher rate of return on the endowment fund is directly and obviously connected to higher spending on the university's academic aims.<p><i>Some gain is necessary to counteract inflation, of course, but T-bills or straight banking would have sufficed for that.</i><p>You don't seem to understand the basic idea behind an endowment. If Harvard didn't earn a reasonable rate of interest on their endowment, they would quickly exhaust it at their current rate of spending. Simply ""counteracting inflation"" but not seeking a competitive return on their endowment would be grossly irresponsible, not to mention wasting a vast amount of capital that could be put to better use.<p>As for the taxation question, I'm not sure how much tax Harvard has to pay.

560174,comment,559976,560120,0,0,chancho,,,"Well I think you're conflating the simple operator syntax with broader issues of static typing. There's no reason you couldn't have Haskell-style operators in a Python-like language, where the definition of each operator is given by a method of its first argument.<p>The 'no-overloading' rule of Haskell is kind of annoying. You can import different definitions of the same function, its just that you then have to disambiguate with a prefix. Like 'List.foldl (+) 0 xs' versus 'Map.foldl (+) 0 xs'. This is made more annoying by the fact that core functions such as foldl aren't typeclass methods. AFAICT the only reason you are forced to disambiguate is because otherwise the compiler would need to use Prolog-style backtracking to typecheck your code on account of type inference. It's perfectly possible, its just that the designers didn't want to force this huge requirement on implementors. Plus a lot of people such as yourself feel that having multiple functions with the same name is a bad thing. I personally don't, as long as they have different types and the compiler is able to disambiguate which one you are referring to based on that type.",1239646991

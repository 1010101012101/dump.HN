Not a conspiracy theory, so much as a lack of interest from Apple to make a decent windows version.<p>On windows, I use winamp.

Maybe the hugely reduced barriers to entry into the technology sector that resulted from cheap computers and good programming tools would lead young and eager people of brilliance to found ambitious companies to finally -- aren't we all sick of being exasperated by the mediocrity of culture and politics in the past 20 years? -- steer human life into better modes of existence and a new frontier of boldness. Sure, the internet cannot do this all on its own, but is such a powerful and promising tool, that maybe it would start things.</i><p>I hate to sound all Statler-and-Waldorf on you, but DO-HO-HO-HO!!!!!<p>Technology is not going to change our social system.

You might find that taking something that is second nature to a higher level (speed-reading technical documents, reading symphonies, division in your head, beating level 41, or whatever) is doable in a few more months.

I.e. a big read ""Find Local"" button.<p>* Have an admin interface for musicians to put concert dates, iTunes links, etc.<p>* Eventually you could become the one-stop shop for discovering new local acts as and figuring out who is playing in your town on a given night.<p>As an example you view some guitar video of a dude shredding a Metallica song. You click on it and you see what band he is in, where/when it is playing, songs from the band that you can stream for free(with user ratings), download for a price (or free if they want). That kind of thing.<p>The reverse of this is also true. You can see a calendar of all of the local acts playing near you. You can click on any act and see all of their fandalism videos as well as all the information I described above.<p>You should be able to purchase tickets and songs through fandalism.<p>Monetization<p>* Take a cut of said ticket and song purchases.<p>* Very subtle premium ads on the main page advertising shows in your area based on your tastes. Personally I would actually be interested in reading these ads.<p>EDIT:<p>Just had another idea which is an addon to my previous idea. A lot of people are coming up with ideas related to Kickstarter. This is a cool concept. I think it would be excellent if Fandalism partnered with music venues so that you have a list of a bunch of different acceptable venues and their seating capacity.<p>Bands or users could initiate Fandalism campaigns to have a band play a live concert. E.g. I'm willing to put $10 to see this band play live on one of these dates. Turns out 1000 other people were willing to do so as well. Fans vote on which of the 1000 person venue they want to go to. Band gets 5k, venue gets 4.5k, fandalism gets 500 bucks.<p>I think this plays to peoples' want to be ahead of the curve.

We've kept improving our technology, while never shortening work-hours.  This means outputs should be up.  Indeed, outputs <i>are</i> up, but the <i>demand</i> for those outputs is not very far up at all.  Why?  Because the profits from the productivity increase didn't get divided in their original proportion, or evenly, between business owners and employees, they went almost entirely to the owners.  Without more money in their pockets, workers mostly aren't demanding the increased output (and when they have, they've bought it on debt and damaged themselves in the long-term).<p>So for the demand levels we've maintained, all we've accomplished with technology is obsoleting vast amounts of labor.  That means businesses <i>need</i> to either shorten working hours, or lay people off.

3866028,comment,3865744,3865836,10,0,sidman,,,"> <i>ALL of these people are at the greatest risk - what will happen if this bubble bursts. We will be FUCKED</i><p>I have the same thoughts exactly. I was a junior at university when the last bubble burst so i have no idea what it was like. Currently i have been running my startup after quitting my job for almost a year and we are doing OK but this talk of bubble worries me because i dont know what to expect.<p>Will it only effect startups that are social types that dont exactly generate revenue but through capital injection( which i assume is what will evaporate the fastest during a pop) have the potential to become massive such as instagram etc or will it also effect the startups that actually do turn up a profit every month so that the founders can eat and re-invest their money back in the business.<p>When i try to draw parallels from 2000 from a technology stand point, i assume the bubble pop killed the tech industry because getting a startup of the ground required tons of cash, it didnt matter whether you could charge from day one or it was a great idea but needed to get to scale before you could make money, you still needed to buy servers, hosting and your development team was larger because there were no frameworks etc .. basically there was alot to spend before you could turn a profit, so when capital dried up so did the ability to start a new company or even continue to run an existing one. As a founder, unless you were already wealthy you could not <i>bootstrap</i><p>Now with amazon, great frameworks that cut down development time many times over and other things of the like, founders can take savings of 10-15k and start a business that can return that investment maybe after 4-5 months and start making profit soon after.<p>The question is, do these kinds of startups still survive, could this be the differentiating factor this time if the bubble pops.<p>Maybe after the bubble pops we wont get those massive social startups that require millions of dollars worth of injection for a while but instead get many smaller bootstrapped <i>business</i> types that take a small investment and return a profit monthly that eventually grow into large business. Its slower but similar to more traditional businesses. If this is the case then i feel its OK, at least if we find an area there people still have a need and technology solves that need we can still make a living doing our own startup and work on things we love.<p>Im also interested because we are bootstrapped and we have managed to get our small startup to give us back about 60% of our salary that we used to get at our 9-5. its enough to live of and not make us wonder where we are going to get our next dinner, however we are thinking of starting something new because we feel there is a ceiling to what we can achieve with our current startup and its important for us to decide what startup to do next if we actually are heading into a bubble that may pop midway through our next project, 1,2 maybe 3 years down the line<p>What do you guys think the tech scene will look like in the valley and possibly around the world if such an event would occur again ?<p>Sorry for the long post but i thought it important to get ideas from the HN community on this topic.",1334883947

In particular, Weitzer was critical of what he viewed as the lack of transparency in how the interviews were conducted and how the responses were translated into statistical data, as well as the sampling bias toward highly marginalized groups of sex workers (such as street workers) and for the way the findings of Farley&#x27;s studies have been more generally applied to demonstrate the harm of sex work of all kinds. A 2002 study by Chudakov, et al. used Farley&#x27;s PTSD instrument to measure the rate of post-traumatic stress disorder among sex workers in Israel. Of the fifty five consenting women interviewed, 17% met the criteria for PTSD, compared to Farley&#x27;s 68% figure. Farley&#x27;s critics also claim that her findings are heavily influenced by her radical feminist ideology.<p>Farley has also been criticized for accepting significant funding from anti-prostitution organizations. She has acknowledged that 30% of funding for a prominent research project into prostitution was provided by the United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, an agency with an outspoken policy which conflates sex work with human trafficking. However, Farley has stated that such funding has not in any way swayed her research, in particular its methods or conclusions.&quot;",1407751113

8162662,comment,8160395,8162312,1,0,hiker,,,"> In that sense, determinism might be a small part of indeterminism.<p>I agree. The astonishing thing about quantum mechanics to me is that it describes how deterministic laws emerge from completely non-deterministic processes.<p>For example, in quantum electrodynamics, a photon going from A to B, chooses a random path with a well defined probability density assigned to each possible path. When you do the math, it turns out that the shortest path between A and B is the most likely one and that&#x27;s why the classical &quot;deterministic&quot; law that light goes in straight lines is a good approximation for large distances. Yet the path which the photon chooses to take is completely random, chosen by the photon&#x27;s free will, if you will.",1407750873
8162661,comment,8160338,8161706,2,0,snogglethorpe,,,"> <i>It&#x27;s completely irrational why there are not the same security measures taken for train passengers</i><p>No, it&#x27;s quite rational (whereas knee-jerk calls for trains to adopt airport-style security theatre are not). High-speed trains and airplanes are very different in their &quot;exposure&quot; to terrorist activity, and in their operating environment.<p>For instance:<p>(1) Airplanes are, relatively speaking, very fragile; a relatively small bomb can bring one down, and if one goes down, 99% of the time, all on board will be killed.  For a terrorist, it&#x27;s a tempting target.<p>Trains, on the other hand, even high-speed trains, are relatively quite robust, and even severe train accidents typically only kill a small fraction of the passengers.  Trains are extremely long (and the passenger density of high-speed trains relatively low compared to local trains), and the direct effect of a blast would be limited to those in the immediate vicinity.  The most you can hope for is to derail the train (which is not at all a given), and even a derailing passenger-train is likely to have many survivors.  The worst train accidents in terms of deaths have been due to the effects of extremely specific locations.<p>(2) As famously shown in 9/11, airplanes can be used as (extraordinarily effective) missiles; if you manage to take one over, you can aim at a wide variety of targets.  Trains basically cannot be used this way.  So if you attack a train, you basically are limited to killing passengers—and as point (1) noted, even that is fairly difficult.<p>(3) Once an airplane is in flight, they&#x27;re pretty much out of reach.  Trains, on the other, because they travel on the ground, are exposed to trackside attack.  If you want to attack a train (for whatever reason), your best bet is to place a large bomb by the side of the track, not to try smuggling one on board.  [That this has, mostly, not been done is probably more a testament to the low &quot;terrorism yield&quot; from attacking trains than to the difficulty of doing it.]<p>Because of this, the benefit of securing passengers is far lower for trains than it is for airplanes.<p>(4) Because one of the big advantages of trains is easy and fast boarding and disembarking of passengers, at multiple points, with relatively minimal infrastructure and staffing, the <i>costs</i> of extreme security would be far more prohibitive for trains than for airplanes.  Given that the <i>advantages</i> of such security would be, at best, very dubious, the costs obviously tend to dominate the discussion.<p>Attacking a train, even a high-speed train, is much more akin to simply attacking <i>any</i> crowded location—a club, a restaurant, a theatre—than it is to attacking an airplane.  [Because of this, an attack on a crowded local train is likely to be more effective than an attack on high-speed rail.]<p>You can cause economic effects by damaging infrastructure, but even that is unlikely to be significant.<p>So basically, (a) trains are just not that attractive a target for terrorism, and (b) the (extreme) costs of airport-style security would not justified by the (very minimal) benefits.  Despite the overlap in the service they provide, airplanes and trains are simply very different in many ways.",1407750866

8162594,comment,8160395,8162367,3,0,Confusion,,,"An important thing in what I wrote is that it only applies to certain sorts of free will. The sorts of free will it applies to include the idea of &#x27;free will&#x27; that many scientifically educated (and usually philosophically untrained) people have. Let&#x27;s call it the &#x27;natural&#x27; or &#x27;naive&#x27; idea of free will. In that view, free will and determinism are incompatible.<p>However, as others have pointed out in parallel answers, there are &#x27;compatibilist&#x27; views in which free will and determinism are compatible. The sorts of &#x27;free will&#x27; that those views apply are different from the naive idea of free will and the important point to take away from that is: it may not be clear to you or me what the phrase &#x27;free will&#x27; actually means.<p>I do not subscribe to compatibilist views, because they define &#x27;free will&#x27; as something that I do not believe is worth wanting. However, that begs the question: what is a definition of &#x27;free will&#x27; that I do believe is worth wanting? And I have found that I cannot answer that question: I cannot define it satisfactorily in a way that is amenable to philosophical analysis, while all definitions that can be analyzed are unsatisfactory.<p>So it boils down to this: I believe it is important to have &#x27;free will&#x27;, but I cannot define what it means to have free will. As I cannot become unhappy about not having something that I do not understand clearly enough to reason further about, my life is effectively no different from never having thought about &#x27;free will&#x27; at all.<p>So that&#x27;s how I deal with it. In a way that is unsatisfactory to many people, because it seems to allow for a bit of &#x27;insert magic here&#x27; just to satisfy my emotional need for the existence of some intuitive notion of free will. To which all I can say is: yes, I believe that believing &quot;I don&#x27;t understand&quot; and being happy is better than believing &quot;the best answer we can come up with is depressing&quot; and not being happy.",1407749477

To do this, I built a (well received) Chrome extension that helps you stay focused on your priority tasks - which automatically syncs your progress with your team:\n<a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dayboard-new-tab-page/kimodcegbhclamjcbifgfaldeengbgij"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dayboard-new-tab-p...</a><p>For those interested in the backstory, you can learn more about this from our feature on Lifehacker (<a href=""http://lifehacker.com/dayboard-uses-chromes-new-tab-page-to-keep-you-focused-1589532616"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lifehacker.com/dayboard-uses-chromes-new-tab-page-to-...</a>) and ProductHunt (<a href=""http://www.producthunt.com/posts/dayboard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.producthunt.com/posts/dayboard</a>)<p>I&#x27;ll be continuing development on this so expect to see new features and improvements.<p>Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback.

If &#x27;you&#x27; are some sort of process analogous to a computer program, you can be totally deterministic yet unpredictable. You can&#x27;t predict in advance the outcome of running some program, c.f. halting problem, without simply running the program slightly faster. Running the program slightly faster is identical to the initial process anyway, since it must get exactly the same inputs. Hence, you are a computational process experiencing itself, everything you feel is valid and no-one can take that away from you :)",1407748280

I would also be interested in seeing how well this does with photos taken every few seconds as opposed to video. Although, after reading the paper, it looks like there would be a lot of optimization that would need to happen to make it more efficient. (Their original implementation took a few hours on a cluster.) Luckily, as they stated in the technical video, they haven&#x27;t tried to do anything more than a proof of concept; so there is plenty of room to optimize. I&#x27;d be interested to see how well a single-machine OpenCL or CUDA implementation does compared to the CPU clusters they were using in the paper.",1407748203

I used to be an apologist for a virtual slot machine—I even wrote some code for one. But once you get out of the system, it&#x27;s so obvious: virtual casinos are unequivocally bad for the gaming ecosystem.<p>Indeed, anything that makes its money primarily by exploiting people at the expensive of competitive creativity—like casinos or native advertising—is bad for the ecosystem.<p>I think many people in journalism will have to discover organically that native advertising is unequivocally bad for the non-fiction ecosystem. It will make tons of money, sure, but their integrity is worth far more.",1407747862

I bet Google themselves will end all support for Gingerbread next year when version M comes out (as they should). It just doesn&#x27;t make sense to support it longer than that, and by then the market share of Gingerbread should be under 15-20 percent, too. Gingerbread is the XP of Android - an old popular version, right before major architectural changes.<p>Android L seems to be the next major architectural change, but I don&#x27;t think KitKat will be the new Gingerbread, because Google is now requiring OEMs to only launch devices that are 2 versions and/or 9 months old, which will soon mean (going by the new release cycle) just 1 version behind. So the transition for new versions should happen a lot smoother in the future.",1407747607

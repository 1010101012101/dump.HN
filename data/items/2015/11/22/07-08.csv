It&#x27;s not great if your goal were a phonetic transliteration into English, but even most European languages would fail that test. For example Polish has quite unintuitive spelling for an English speaker. Same with Portuguese and Danish for that matter. If you put pinyin alongside those languages as just another Latin-script-using-language, I don&#x27;t find it especially weird, basically in the normal range of variation. An English speaker has to learn specific rules to pronounce it (approximately) correctly, but not an unusually large number of them.",1448179190

I think it would be great for Groupon to answer them.<p>Here it goes:<p>* Groupon attracts bargain hunters that never come back. It can&#x27;t be compared to other forms of advertising because the customer you get as a result of a Groupon is less valuable than customers you get from other forms of advertising.<p>* Groupon cannibalizes sales from customers that would have otherwise paid full price.<p>* In summary, why should I believe that Groupon is a good form of advertising for small businesses when compared to the other options?<p>* Whatever the answer, why should I take the word of this corporation over the many small business owners who have reported poor experiences?<p>Let me know if I missed anything and I&#x27;ll add it.<p>Andrew",1448178470

For example, for an error the code could be written to SHA1(seed || counter). In this case you can &quot;re-open&quot; the hash function and perform an &quot;length extension attack&quot;, so you add &quot;0&quot; at the end and successfully predicted one of the successive IDs. HMACs are constructs used to make sure the secret and plaintex is mixed in a more cryptographic robust way, basically.<p>2) If you don&#x27;t trust /dev/urandom to seed the generator, you have no reasons to trust that /dev/urandom cannot be predicted by observing some part of the old stream of bytes.<p>More information about the attack I described are available here: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_extension_attack"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_extension_attack</a>",1448177270

Inflation is caused by poor capital investment or capital destruction.  Central planning can cause this if the planners are not careful to make bad investments fail on a regular basis and free up goods of higher orders for alternative investment.<p>Japan has a western financial model where the government is on the hook for bank bailouts and has to borrow money from a central bank to fund spending so it obeys the western &quot;economic realities&quot; which are an artifact of that system.",1448176794

Or are you just saying that they are allying with the Arabs?<p>Both.\nYes they are Arabs. for example you can search Iraqi people in Iran&#x27;s regime. or People they call &quot;Seyed&quot;.which means they have arab roots.Which is more than 20+ of people.and for specific people in root of power you can  search about Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi .(or Mohammad Reza Naqdi or so many others)\nAnd second one is true also, They are ripping Iran in favor of Arab countries which Iran&#x27;s people naturally don&#x27;t give fuck about them.<p>They are basically trying to be hero in middle east , because they don&#x27;t have option other than that, because whole region is dominated by sunni Muslims who basically hate shia.They are trying to be hero in Palestine issue, not because they give fuck about Palestine . because they want impose their hegemony to other countries.and being <i>hero</i> is always best figure.<p>>I&#x27;m not talking about you, I was just asking about what the Iranian government is teaching its population. One of my Iranian colleagues told me how they taught them that Arabs are backward and barbarics, and that only Islam saved them. I wanted to get another anecdote.<p>Are fucking kidding me ? last time I checked you comment , your sentence was &quot;Can I ask you if you were taught by the Iranian government to hate (or at least look down on) Arabs?&quot;<p>This only can show how much your claims and statements are stupid and meaningless . When you use &quot;YOU&quot; in your sentence. This means you are pointing to your next person.<p>>Yes, I read it in Arabic.\nThen if you don&#x27;t lie (which I cannot believe), then you should know they only incentive for people for being <i>good</i> is sex and 72 virgin . that&#x27;s all . the whole stupid religion hinges on that .<p>>Unfortunately, there are many fabricated stories that exists in the Twelver books.

Our site is allocating incredible amounts of memory per page request, and it took us forever to figure out we didn&#x27;t have a memory leak, at least in the traditional sense. We&#x27;re running .NET, and its GC scheduler has 3 tiers for objects 0,1, and 2. 0 and 1 are short lived objects, but after an object has been around long enough the GC assumes it will probably be around forever and the 2nd tier garbage collector gets almost no time to run. We proved this by forcing the GC-2 to run longer and it brings the memory under control, so we don&#x27;t have a &quot;leak&quot;, per se, but we still can&#x27;t figure out why these ephemeral objects are sticking around long enough to get so promoted.",1448176125

I was custom building a new server for a customer, very nice build, Xeon E5 10 Core, 64GB DDR ECC RAM, Windows Server 2012 R2, SSDs, etc...<p>Everything is going well, update and configure bios, install Windows, install drivers and software. Then start configuring the server, sever needs to reboot, reboots to a blue screen of death. Can&#x27;t get it to boot up normally. Ok must be bad software, driver, etc... Time for a clean install, everything is going fine and then reboot -> blue screen. Look up the bug check code, no help. Another clean install, this time no extra software, no drivers, same problem after a reboot. Finally figure out that it is only happening after I make the computer a domain controller. After Googling with this new information, I find one thread on some forum where people are having the same problem, turns out it was the solid state drive, if you use a Samsung 850 Evo SSD with Windows Server 2012, it will blue screen if you make it a domain controller. I never thought a problem like this was possible. Sure enough changed the installation drive and no more problems. Nearly drove me crazy, took me two days of troubleshooting.",1448175688

6655240,comment,6653914,6654889,2,0,Ologn,,,"The bug was reported in February 2010 to the Debian bug tracker, where it was forever ignored, although the fix was trivial (replace the vol_id comment with blkid).  In May 2010 Ubuntu downstream is syncing with Debian ( <a href=""https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/partman-target/67ubuntu1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/partman-target/67ubuntu...</a> ), sees the bug report and fixes it in Ubuntu.  Then in February 2011, a duplicate of the original bug is reported and gets fixed in Debian.<p>I was impressed by the fact that Ubuntu fixed this within three months even though the bug report was in the upstream ticket system, where it had not been fixed.  Debian fixed it nine months after Ubuntu.<p>I appreciate the fact that Canonical has done things which help Ubuntu which sometimes, inadvertently or not, hurt Debian.  For example, Canonical hiring so many Debian developers helped make the sarge release late.  As I said in my post, Ubuntu is not that good about sending patches upstream.  For a while, I was of the mind that Ubuntu was a mixed bag that in some ways helped and in some ways hurt the FLOSS community.  Although over the past year or two, it seems the trend has been more toward the latter way.",1383328739

Homeless shelters, per resident-wise, are much more expensive to run than an equivalent place housing, well, people like us.<p>Some homeless people avoid shelters even if there are space because they are frequently giant nests of disease and violence. Besides catching some rather unpleasant diseases and pests, your odds of getting stabbed increase dramatically.<p>So you&#x27;d have to pay for hygiene, health, and security expenses well above and beyond the norm. And that&#x27;s just if you want to pursue the &quot;containment&quot; side of housing the chronically homeless.<p>If you want to pursue the &quot;rehabilitation&quot; side it gets even crazier. A large portion of the population suffer from severe mental health problems that prevent them from any meaningful integration into mainstream society, and mental health care ain&#x27;t cheap.<p>That said I do believe it should be done, but it isn&#x27;t &quot;oh yeah just levy a tiny tax&quot; territory.",1383328706

If they were required to stay with the original owner and weren&#x27;t transferrable, this would be a different (and similarly problematic issue), but as patents have value and are transferrable, they will be bought and sold as investments by various people/corporations/whatever.<p>In theory patents are maybe a good idea because it provides exclusive rights to &quot;own&quot; an idea for enough time to extract value out of it by selling a product or service around it (if you so choose). You could argue that software patents lasting 20 years is &quot;too long&quot; for technology. You could also argue that patents aren&#x27;t worldwide enforceable so, you need to get one everywhere, or basically you can&#x27;t enforce it.<p>I don&#x27;t really know that you can &quot;fix&quot; patents without throwing them away and rethinking them, but on a system as large and impactful as patents, the repercussions might be a lot worse than the problems we have now.",1383328490

Hurricanes don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re insured, but trolls have an interest in taking troll insurance down. The way insurance works means that if you have a statistically unlikely run of bad luck, you could topple the whole insurance enterprise and leave those who thought they were covered out in the cold.<p>If I were a troll, I&#x27;d get together with other trolls and coordinate enough legal pressure that it was impossible to go to court on all the pending cases at once.<p>2.<p>Having insurance like this legitimizes the whole trolling issue, instead of fixing the systemic issues that cause it in the first place. You might think that doesn&#x27;t matter since we can&#x27;t really fix the trolling issue, but we can (maybe) create insurance to route around the problem. But here&#x27;s why it actually does matter: if the troll insurance works and isn&#x27;t killed by my point #1, then we&#x27;ve actually created a lobbying group with a vested interest in keeping trolling alive. In other words, the organization we created to protect us, if it actually works, will have strong incentive to work against our long term best interests by allying themselves with the trolls they are supposed to be protecting us against.<p>We&#x27;d essentially be creating a protection racket to extort /ourselves/.<p>Can&#x27;t see this working.",1383327776

A lot.<p>Our backend is a highly concurrent system written in Java using MongoDB. You might know Java or you might not, but either way you&#x27;re willing to learn. If you don&#x27;t know it - you can impress us in your language of choice. You understand algorithms matter. You also understand sloppy database access could make that ugly n^2 algorithm look absolutely blazing fast.<p>You love to code. You love to show off your results now and then to other engineers (as they&#x27;re probably the only folks around who might get the intracacies of what you&#x27;re excited about)<p>We&#x27;re looking for both Senior and Junior backend engineers.

You can talk to other Senior engineers with very few words because you both know the special cases, assumptions, and pitfalls cold.<p>If you&#x27;re a Junior engineer, you love to code and you&#x27;re good at it.

Now Canonical can maintain that patch or not.

6654951,comment,6654346,6654346,9,0,swang,,,"I just want to post this from the baseball card collecting perspective. Comic books and baseball cards share a pretty similar correlation between their values and their declines in the 80s to 2000s. The glut actually started in the mid 80s and not the 90s. And due to waning interest from kids due to both video games and the Internet their markets have slowly declined. The only difference is baseball cards have escalated to being essentially a lottery/gambling game while comics actually still have some value as entertainment itself.<p>Basically card collecting now is a big gamble. You can buy $100 packs and they either have some common value cards worth maybe $5 or you might pull a great card that you can probably sell for $5K. Only a small percentage of people come out of it as a &quot;winner&quot; but because of the rush people get from pulling these special cards they continue to be bought. And even though $100 seems out of reach for kids, I have seen tons of videos on YouTube of kids who buy these packs.<p>And since there is only one company now that can produce baseball cards (out of maybe 3-4 total card producing companies), they need to make their money back from buying the license from MLBPA/MLB so they essentially glut the market with tons and tons of different sets. Allen Ginter, Gypsy Queen, Bowman (there was ~3 different sets of Bowman released the last time I collected, and Bowman generally is for rookie/minor leaguers and since most of them will probably not make it to the majors, the set is going to contain a lot of useless cards/inserts), Topps, and some other sets they sell at like >$500 per pack.<p>And the people on Craigslists who think their sealed 1992 Topps sets are worth any more than ~$5 or people who are selling those huge boxes of 80s/90s cards for $200 is laughable. You could literally burn half the world&#x27;s supply of 80s/90s baseball cards and those cards would still probably be just as worthless. Just a huge, huge, worthless glut of cardboard.<p>Edit: Took out roulette comment, made no sense.",1383325719

Now that a couple years have gone by and I&#x27;m OK I think I can provide some comfort to job hoppers.<p>My background: I&#x27;ve been an employed developer for over two years. Over the two years I&#x27;ve gone from cutting my teeth at a start up doing Customer Support and any programming they would let me get my hands on to being considered somewhere in between Mid-level and Senior in my particular environment. During this journey I&#x27;ve been at four different companies for 6 months, 8 months, 4 months, and 6 months. I&#x27;ve always exceeded all goals and contributed in big ways in short periods of time. I&#x27;m now a Consultant because I think it is more suited for how I like to work on a lot of different things with different people and I have enough experience and successes to be able to be a consultant (ie. people will pay me for my services).<p>During the interviews for my last two jobs the hiring managers brought up my job history point blank. One even directly called me a job hopper. I didn&#x27;t shy away from their perception or try to convince them that this time it would be different. While some may see this as sugar coating, I indirectly told them that I am a challenge hopper. I talked about the projects I&#x27;ve worked on and the impact I&#x27;ve had. I talked about the value I&#x27;ve brought to the teams I&#x27;ve been on and what I do to better myself as a programmer.<p>All companies are looking for the good old &quot;V&quot; word - value. Some companies will be more interested in how long you&#x27;re likely to stick around for. If how long I&#x27;m likely to stick around is that important to them then I treat this difference the same way I would anything else that we don&#x27;t see eye to eye on - I walk away.<p>In the land of software we are lucky to have this affordability because of demand for programmers is high and margins on software can be extremely high. Jump around a little bit and learn a lot. Maybe you&#x27;ll do that forever. Maybe you&#x27;ll go do your ownt hing. Maybe you&#x27;ll settle down. You&#x27;ve got a skill.

If you&#x27;re working on a well established product at a medium to large company it may take longer to do much real development (beyond bug fixing and paper shuffling), so it may take longer to figure out if you want to stay longer.  However, at a startup, you&#x27;ll probably be dropped right into the fire on the first day, so you may be able to determine that more quickly.<p>When I&#x27;ve looked at resumes, anything less than a year at a job usually raises a flag. Unless there are a lot of jobs on your resume like that, it&#x27;s not a negative thing, but I would absolutely ask about it during an interview.",1383325392

6654901,comment,6654341,6654341,3,0,iharris,,,"I&#x27;ve worked for a POS company for five years and boy, do I have some stories about the industry! I definitely agree with the OP that the market is littered with terrible products that were knocked together in VB or Delphi, overpriced, and put together with little consideration for actual use cases.<p>With that said, I don&#x27;t think that there exists a &#x27;one size fits all&#x27; solution. For small and medium retailers without their own IT staff, a service contract makes a lot of sense (consider hardware failure or a corrupted database, or re-training on the system&#x27;s admin functionality for example). These guys often have a very large inventory and I doubt that a lightweight product (eg Square Register) can manage it elegantly. Unfortunately the needs of these retailers often result in a huge, enterprise-y solution that is both cumbersome and expensive to maintain.<p>Large retail franchises generally hire firms to tailor a POS product for them, service it, and integrate it into their existing ecosystem (SAP, PeopleSoft etc.).<p>I think the small retailer market is really interesting and some newcomers like Square Register are shaking things up. Small retailers are often family-owned and really need a product that works out of the box, is easy to configure and use, accepts credit cards, and is very inexpensive. If the POS is designed intelligently then there retailer can probably run the entire thing themselves as long as they don&#x27;t need special features (think gas stations, loyalty programs, and other markets like hospitality).<p>I think the OP&#x27;s project looks awesome  and it seems to be targeted at small businesses with low- to medium throughput and where the manager is reasonably technical (see the reviews from the SourceForge page where people dont know how to set it up - these folks probably need a ready-made solution or a consultant). I could also see consultants taking this and extending it to compete with a lot of the existing products out there, which I would be really excited to see!",1383325349

The majority of nice old pieces from the late 19th century are worth only $50-$80. It&#x27;s something that seemed obviously valuable to people so nobody threw them away, even once they went out of fashion in actual use. So there are literally millions of pocket watches out there still, since everyone has their grandfather&#x27;s old watch. And they regularly appear on eBay, keeping the market supplied. Even if a large proportion are cannibalized for parts or lost, it&#x27;s still enough supply that collectors&#x27; demand doesn&#x27;t push prices very high.",1383325317

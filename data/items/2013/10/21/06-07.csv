6583816,comment,6582494,6582494,9,0,yarianluis,,,"As an Android developer, I love that Google is doing this!<p>Android has come a <i>very</i> long way in the last few years in terms of usability and design. A large part of this has been due to an increasingly uniform design language and feel. That, and the new distribution model for what are basically Android updates (Google Play Services) has made Android feel more polished and actually allowed it to stand on its own against iOS. It also means that developers like me don&#x27;t have to spend nearly as much time worrying about fragmentation in the traditional sense. Each day the percentage of people using sub-ICS phones falls, and we all get one step closer to the day we can support ICS+ only.<p>However, companies like Amazon would force me to rewrite the maps integration, the sign-in portion, the wallet, etc... Amazon did a great job of replicating Google Maps API V1 but they have yet to mirror V2 and don&#x27;t mirror the other components I mentioned.<p>Aside from fragmentation and developer sanity, the article mentions another key point here:<p>&quot;[M]any of Google&#x27;s solutions offer best-in-class usability, functionality, and ease-of-implementation.&quot;<p>Exactly! Google APIs are not perfect, and there&#x27;s bugs (like when Google Maps broke map markers on high resolution phones like the HTC One). But generally speaking, I&#x27;m really happy with the quality of the APIs and services. In an ideal world, Amazon and Google would work together to provide great and uniform single-sign-in APIs, great maps, etc... As it currently stands though, I don&#x27;t believe either party is interested in doing so. Prisoner&#x27;s dilemma?",1382338775

Surface learners can make pretty good PHP programmers, but they&#x27;ll struggle with, say, passing Javascript closures.<p>A deep learner will look for the underlying principles and abstractions. They can quickly get an overview that, even when it&#x27;s fuzzy, is still accurate enough for them to know where the gaps in their knowledge are, so they can fill those gaps quickly when they need to.

What if that is not the goal?<p>Is it possible that some users might not type their searches in a Google-sponsored search bar or a Google-controlled browser&#x27;s &quot;omni&quot; bar?<p>Is it possible that some websites might get traffic from their domain names alone, because these names are descriptive?  No search engine needed: Type your search into the address bar and add .com.<p>I believe this is called &quot;direct navigation&quot;.  Presumably, these sites generate small scale (but targeted) traffic on a site by site basis that might only be significant when aggregated across many sites.

Moreover, the Go tour is very nice, and it gives enough material to any programmer to start writing short programs using http, images, channels,... in only a few hours.<p>This said, very often, using Go feels backwards to me. It could be because of I have personal gripes with the package management system, but I easily ignore those cosmetic things when I&#x27;m getting stuff done, so it&#x27;s not.<p>After getting used to type systems like the one Haskell has, Go feels very primitive. Moreover, the lack of generics and support for functional programming makes my programs longer, less readable, and less friendly for teamwork. Even though I still sell Go to my friends as a replacement for most of the scripting languages they use, (Typed) Clojure and Haskell are languages that are way friendlier to me.<p>I would take Go over C or C++ any day, simply because it would allow me to write relatively readable programs in less time, but if the task fits within what Clojure or Haskell does right, I would not hesitate for a second.<p>As of today, I primarily use Go for infrastructure work, and it really shines there. I am going to replace a lot of Python code with it, and it&#x27;s not necessarily for the performance, but for the ease of deployment, the reliability, the fact that Python developers can read it, and the static typing. That is to say I don&#x27;t disagree with the author, but I want to provide another point of view.<p>The language I believe will deliver what I hoped with Go is Rust.

We pay ~2x as much for comparable health care (per person per mean PPP-adjusted GDP/capita) [1]. That is about 250b/yr we are spending on a (more closely) free market system that keeps promising to be more efficient than its social counterparts and keeps failing to deliver, or even deliver in the same ballpark. I realize that HN is a site about code, but it&#x27;s important to keep some perspective here. $500M (itself an inflated figure) is 0.2% of $250b. If it is hard to ague against $500M of waste, it surely must be nearly impossible to argue against $250b of yearly, recurring waste, no? How do you ignore these figures?!<p>If you&#x27;re going to argue that our system makes up the difference with better outcomes, I want to see numbers. I happen to know that they don&#x27;t support this argument, but I want you to do the search so that you can&#x27;t dismiss my sources by assuming they were cherry-picked.<p>>  I happen to think ... Free market decentralized healthcare ... would have been a far better approach<p>Of course, $250b/yr includes the cost of providing care as well as administration. Perhaps administration of a free market system is more efficient? Not when you compare the US (31% administrative overhead) to Canada (16.7%) or the UK (6%) [2], [3]. This isn&#x27;t a surprising result, either: I recently listed 7 reasons why exchanges should be more efficient than current individual plans [4] and you can add the profit margin and advertising costs to that list to come up with 9 advantages a single-payer system would have over a free market health care system.<p>Markets are good at optimizing things that can be quantified, so perhaps a better comparison would be between medicare and private insurance (not overall administration, just the insurance part). Again, the government systems come out ahead: Medicare overhead is 3.6%, Canada&#x27;s insurance-related overhead is 1.3%, and overhead among private US insurers is 11.7% [2].<p>>  Cheaper, faster, better.

They only have to talk to one another and get the esteem of their most immediate peers - but beyond that the world leaves them alone.<p>The sense in which they have their head in the sand is that the world is increasingly asking them to justify their existence more and more - which is forcing academics to engage in various ways more with the external world.  And naturally, they don&#x27;t enjoy doing this.  But rather than bite the bullet and tackle full on the problem of demonstrating their value - they just become somewhat histrionic at the suggestion that they have to justify themselves... and in the end - and this is the important bit - FAIL to deliver a coherent defense.<p>And before you say it: &quot;Academics need to be left alone to their own devices otherwise you won&#x27;t get innovations borne of long terms motivation and incomprehensible (to the common folk) abstract thinking.&quot;<p>This doesn&#x27;t help - even if true.

Me smacking a dude for talking shit doesn&#x27;t even come close to the totality of systemic violence: war, poverty, houselessness, rape, abuse, racism, hunger, prison, policing, immigrant concentration camps, border security, alienation, queer bashing, trans murders, environmental catastrophe on a global scale. And that&#x27;s just the present situation. This violence is felt by individuals very personally, but it is systemic in cause, affect, and result.<p>The police, media, and state point the finger at a very specific subset of activity and call it violence in order to distract from the overwhelming violence they perpetrate. This is particularly true of those who resist the current state of affairs. Rioters are &quot;violent&quot; because they smash windows. The cops who beat them are merely restoring order. Police are rarely described as &quot;violent&quot; even though they frequently shoot people and control populations with the use of force. Prisoners are the violent ones, not the ones who lock people up in cages. The most oppressed are the violent ones, not those who maintain the system of violence.<p>To give a little perspective on anarchy and violence:<p>Anarchism tends to reject moralism. The question isn&#x27;t whether it&#x27;s good or bad to kill Frick. It&#x27;s not about punishing a person for a bad behavior as that sounds awfully like what the state does and it&#x27;s so-called &quot;Justice.&quot; Rather, it&#x27;s about what force this activity will generate. If a hated figure is assassinated, will this spark revolt? This idea was called &quot;propaganda of the deed&quot; and a similar idea lives on in smashing windows and similar small-scale activities among current North American anarchists: activities that can be picked up by others easily and may spread among the wider population. Other ideas tend to focus on blowing shit up and stuff, like the CCF and FAI. That&#x27;s cool and all, but I don&#x27;t think that spectacular acts of violence against the state will do anything to hasten its demise.",1382336276

The last time I paid a little real money to get hold of my personal credit report from one of these credit reporting organisations, it was so riddled with obvious errors, including more than a few wildly inaccurate data points, that I was on the phone to them for something like half an hour to get them to correct everything.

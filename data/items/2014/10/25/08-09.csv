It will not work on your driveway, on a sidewalk, etc.. you need a thickly skinned surface of copper or aluminum for it to work at all. So unless you have several thousand dollars worth of 1/4&quot; thick copper or aluminum sheeting around, this &quot;hoverboard&quot; will not work.<p>It&#x27;s NOT a real hoverboard.

You could have an ivy league background. Now someone thinks you&#x27;re overqualified for the position, and picks the cheaper candidate.<p>In my case, it was part luck and part a numbers game. I was 17, and applied at ~30 companies for their IT roles. Why not? It was cheap for me (print resume, mail, follow up over phone) both in resources and time.

Some of it is legitimately useful, Google now and Inbox for instance, their Gmail spam detection etc. But they clearly do use that data to target adverts better than anyone else, and there&#x27;s a crossover in things like Now where some of that stuff is actually adverts.<p>Anyway, point is they do make money off targeted adverts. That&#x27;s not a bad thing, they&#x27;re not actually selling your data. Indeed that data is what makes them successful, they are motivated to invest an awful lot in keeping it secure and private in the sense nobody else can have it, only they can use it to target ads. In that sense I trust Google with my data but I know they are using it. Obvious caveat being NSA etc.<p>But then there&#x27;s companies that focus less on targeted ads, like Apple. They can market on things staying on the device and never reaching their servers. Things like Apple Pay and Health, like you mentioned, I believe in both cases they claim not to have access. For Google there could be real value in combining that data with other stuff they know and offering unparalleled insights, and using their increased knowledge to better target ads. That seems to be the typical Google approach - and there are clear advantages and disadvantages to both - and again I consider that data to be safe even if Google has it.. With the obvious caveat.<p>With the NSA etc, Apple&#x27;s way seems to be safer (with the obvious caveats of being opaque and closed software)  or could be marketed that way.

While the issue is complex, it really boils down to something simple. The US government was formed with certain principles, some outlined in the constitution. One of those is free speech. Sometimes, the government has to step in and make sure corporations are respecting those principles. Net neutrality is one of those times.",1414225057

I don&#x27;t see any relevance.&quot;<p>The _leaked emails_ of the Game Journo Pros mailing list, not the list itself. That&#x27;s what I said. In them you can see Ben Kuchera putting pressure on other members to remove mentions of ZQ, Kyle Orland saying he would love to use his platform to support ZQ, Jason Schreier defending Nathan Grayson and so on and so forth. Then, starting August the 28th, a dozen major gaming sites put out almost exactly the same story that &quot;Gamers are dead&quot; in a 24-hour period basically telling their readers to get lost. Collusion and corruption exemplified. The Escapist is not at all comfortable with this and rewrites its policies and fesses up. Good on them. By the way, linking to articles written by members of this list and their sympathisers isn&#x27;t going to impress me. It&#x27;s what we have a problem with in the first place: biased, inaccurate coverage.<p>&quot;Moderators deleting threads that go against the terms of service sounds pretty typical. What makes this any different?&quot;<p>a) that they weren&#x27;t anything to do with terms of service and b) the vastness of the scope. Examples: a thread on Reddit with 20 000 comments was deleted. 4chan suffered a mass exodus to 8chan because of deletions. Kotaku, RPS and Polygon refuse to allow any sort of discussion at ALL of this. This is what GamerGate supporters have a problem with.<p>&quot;You seem to be claiming that a messy breakup justifies sending death threats to completely unrelated people. Perhaps you&#x27;d like to clarify?&quot;<p>Certainly. For a start, let me say again: there is NO evidence connecting GamerGate supporters to death threats. None. The threats that were sent to Anita Sarkeesian? No evidence of links to GamerGate. The threats sent to Brianna Wu? No evidence of links to GamerGate. In fact, she was the one that made the connection (on national TV no less) where there wasn&#x27;t one. A big fight on Twitter always attracts malicious third parties and we have STRONG evidence that Something Awful and GNAA have been trolling BOTH sides with threats. It&#x27;s what they do. Both Nero and KingofPol have received physical items in the mail: a syringe and a knife, and have laughed them off. But the professional victims of the other side immediately publicise them and say &#x27;see? see? Look at these GamerGaters!&#x27;<p>As I write this, a prominent defender of GamerGate has just been SWATted. He&#x27;s immediately reported it to the FBI. That&#x27;s what you do when you get harassed. You go straight to the authorities. You don&#x27;t go on tour about it.",1414224328

All experienced embedded systems developers know this: embedded compilers tend to be much buggier than compilers for desktop platforms.  But desktop compilers are buggy too.  Over the last couple years my group has reported 190 bugs to compiler development teams.  A lot of these bugs turn up only at higher optimization levels.  If you search on my email address ""regehr@cs.utah.edu"" as bug reporter in either GCC or LLVM's bugzilla, you can see plenty of examples.",1266083848

1123246,comment,1121711,1122323,0,0,CPlatypus,,,"Some notes from the OP author.  ;)<p>(1) Neither PVFS2 nor Lustre requires shared storage except to do hot failover for a failed server.  I've personally run both in configurations where the only storage was node-local RAM.  Disk failures can be avoided using host-based RAID, while node failures can be handled either by software disk mirroring (e.g. DRBD) or by physically moving the disks to another server.  Are these approaches optimal, or even acceptable in a typical production environment?  Of course not; there's a severe performance hit for the first and an even worse availability hit for the second.  I do believe this is a positive differentiator for GlusterFS (though the AFR translator does exact a high performance toll) but it's not quite accurate to say or imply Lustre or PVFS2 can't be used without shared storage and it's a bit unfair to mention that for one but not the other.<p>(2) It's only somewhat surprising to me that Lustre still doesn't have distributed metadata.  I knew they were making a very big push for it in 1.8.  Then I left SiCortex, and after two years dealing with Lustre lameness I actively avoided it thereafter.  Adding distributed metadata after the fact is Very Hard, so the fact that they failed (for at least the third time) isn't a surprise.",1266083813

I have been on OSX for the past five years and love it, the perfect blend of polished apps and real unix underpinnings.

Another choice is Ubuntu, but having run it at various times, I know that there is a good bit of frustration involved now and then due to hardware drivers, especially on laptops.

1123209,comment,1119992,1120617,0,0,algolicious,,,"Of course C++ has RAII, as you must know.  Allocate the object on the stack or, if you must, use a stack-allocated auto_ptr if you want it to last as long as the block, as the destructors for stack-allocated objects form the hidden ""finally"" clause of every block.  Otherwise, it is stored somewhere, and the object that stores it should manage it.  If you store an object in many different places with no master location, you are starting to wander into automatic memory management territory.<p>As for my rationale, reference counting is by most accounts an obsolete form of garbage collection.  The smaller your object is, the more space you waste.  If your references are at all cyclic, you have to introduce weak references, in which case you must understand your memory structure to the point where you should be able to manage your memory without garbage collection.  (Languages such as Java contain weak references, but are never needed and only should be used for things that the programmer is willing to lose such as a cache.)

They baulk at the challenge and run from this new knowledge. They fail and become extinct. Yet there is nothing fundamentally wrong with them - it is a failure of the imagination.""<p>""I hope that if I can get across the concept that I am a product of just such evolution, it may give them the confidence to try.""<p>I vote for staying human, and not obsoleting ourselves.<p>The idea of becoming like the god of this story reinforces this conviction.  He reminds me of Q from Star Trek, toying with species for his own amusement, having some arbitrary conception of what makes a species worthwhile, mainly revolving around that species ability to shape the material universe around them.<p>To me, what this story demonstrates is that Atheists are not actually opposed to God like beings.  But they are scandalized by a God who does not regard technological advancement as the highest calling.  They cannot possibly take a God like Jesus seriously, for example, because he was not at all concerned about correcting the scientific misunderstandings of human beings.  He only cared about how people treated each other, human relationships, attitudes of the human heart, and love.  For me, the verse that demonstrates Jesus nature is also the shortest in the Bible: ""Jesus wept.""  True, he did not (and does not) always intervene to eliminate suffering and tragedy, like the being in Talking to God.  But he does empathize with us, to the point he was willing to literally share in our suffering alongside us.",1266081179

Sitting in an office doing what is told for 40 hours is ridiculous and hellish, and it's much of why that system doesn't work. People ""revolt"" by showing up and working at 1/8 speed.<p>If we extend the definition of ""work"" to include self-directed projects, education and enrichment, 40-55 is about right; 40 for most people and 55 for the more ambitious.<p>Beyond 60 hours per week, marginal productivity is minimal.",1266081163

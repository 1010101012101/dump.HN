7842986,comment,7842133,7842838,2,0,kannanvijayan,,,"My code doesn&#x27;t work under race conditions.  You&#x27;re right the increment should be done before and the decrement after to avoid races.  I just banged out the logic without giving it too much thought.<p>On removing redundant incref/decref pairs - this is nice, but it seems mostly a benefit because of the &quot;automatic&quot; part, not the refcounting part.  Developers dealing with manual refcounting would probably recognize places where refcount manipulation is redundant and just elide them.  A naive automation ends up inserting them everywhere, and this helps bring that back to what a &quot;smart developer&quot; would have written anyway.<p>On your second point, I&#x27;ve heard about this trick - in particular in smalltalk implementations.  It&#x27;s something I haven&#x27;t fully looked into.  It seems like the in-pointer refcount would only be valid if the pointer never escaped the function frame.  More generally, you&#x27;d have to be able to guarantee that a particular pointer is the only reference to an object before the refcount could be stored in the pointer bits itself.<p>If you have more insight into the implementation of this, I&#x27;d be interested in hearing it.  This &quot;small refcount pointer tagging&quot; thing is something I&#x27;ve been meaning to understand better but haven&#x27;t gotten around to.",1401832785
7842985,story,,,1,0,chiikod,"Ask HN: Be my mentor or startup advisor at Salebox.co",,"You are passionate about startup entrepreneurs. You have successfully managed to start a business or work with startups. You have a passion for eCommerce. Please I need your help!!!<p>------\nBasically, I need your help because I have tried to do business since 2011 but lamentably failed. I have tried starting different businesses but i have always ended on the losing side (to an extent that I found myself in terrible debt). Recently, a friend who happens to be a distributor gave me about $15,000 worth of goods to start a wholesale       business. While doing the wholesale business, I have discovered that many consumers are exploited because of the complex system surrounding the distribution channel. Goods and services often pass to consumers through multiple channels. While increasing the number of ways in which a consumer can find a good has the potential to increase sales, it also creates a complex system that can also make distribution management difficult. Consumers usually pay high prices for goods purchased because of the middlemen between the manufacturer and the retailer. At SaleBox, our goal is to create a platform that will allow small scale retailers to buy products direct from manufacturers just like supermarkets do and hence enable consumers to buy goods at low prices.<p>---------\nHelp me make this a reality.",1401832764

7842983,comment,7842282,7842850,6,0,gsharma,,,"I ran an e-commerce site focused on Indians living in US a few years ago. Here are a few things that might help you:<p>1. It seems like your target market is Indian women in USA (guessed based on prices in $) IMO this is still not a niche market. Is your target market Indians who immigrated to US or born here? What age group (working moms vs students)? Why do they need these clothes (casual wear vs Indian parties vs weddings, etc.)? Does your target market live in major cities (like Bay Area) where there are a few offline options available or do they live in remote locations where the nearest Indian grocery store is 50 miles away? Or maybe I am completely wrong and your target market is non-Indian women in US.<p>2. What did you learn from driving traffic to the site? I see that you listed phone numbers, did anyone call? I would highly recommend using Olark/Zopim and actively chat with people who click on your ad campaigns to ask them what they are looking for.<p>3. Checkout IndianRoots.com. It is owned by NDTV, the biggest USP they have is free world wide shipping and I know a few people who have already used it. Not sure if you can compete with them on free shipping , but worth looking at.<p>And as the article says, talk to your users. Running ad campaigns work to drive people onto your site but you&#x27;ll have to talk to your users to find out what are their pain points and what do they need.",1401832730

7842980,comment,7842420,7842420,10,0,ctdonath,,,"A telling & loaded question: <i>Are people working so many hours because we’ve just somehow independently conceived this desire for lattes and Panini and dog-walkers and the like, or is it that people are grabbing food and coffee on the go and hiring people to walk their dogs because they’re all working so much?</i><p>Making panini or coffee - <i>good</i> ones - takes effort, time, and resources to a degree few are willing to engage on their own. I&#x27;ve a dozen coffee makers, acquired in the quest to learn how to brew a perfect cup, and still drop $1.75 at Starbucks because a swipe of a card and a few minutes of scheduled skilled labor are often preferable to finding decent beans, grinding them, heating water, buying & fitting a filter, pouring, timing, cleaning and stowing what&#x27;s needed; ditto lunch and dog-walking. Sure, we could all make fancy lunches and fine coffees and walk the dogs, and enjoy doing so at select times, but most people are unable and unwilling to at that level day-in-and-day-out when slinging dirt, paper, or bits can acquire such lifestyle.<p>As for the &quot;BS jobs&quot;: in between the productive (slinging dirt, or deciding who should sling which dirt where) are &quot;glue jobs&quot; and &quot;filler jobs&quot;, not notable of themselves but required to cover & hold together aspects of productivity, without which cumulatively expensive problems would arise.<p>That opportunities in any job may be abused for personal gain, or trail off to nothing useful, is simply a reality of human nature and imperfect systems.<p>The question, foundational to much of the biased rambling in the rest of the interview, is either naive or disingenuous. We <i>have</i> independently conceived of odd luxuries, and made them profitable for someone to do despite being arguably wasteful, or that they are in fact our chosen outlet for the long-predicted &quot;life of leisure&quot;. Like &quot;living on the Moon&quot;, the remote notion is romanticized, but when given the option to ... most people are disinterested in eeking out survival on a giant atmosphere-free dead rock, or idly reading or playing games whilst subsisting on mundane food & accommodations; rather, they&#x27;d instead choose a routine of imposed obligations, coupled with swipe-a-card easy access to higher luxuries of relatively fine foods and fancier surroundings.<p>I guess my gripe with the interviewee is that he has a notion of how society should be, and argues toward forcing economic redistributions to make it happen ... decrying & denying the reality that the economy is what it is, on the whole, because it&#x27;s the cumulation of free choices. Sure, I could be living a &quot;life of leisure&quot; (and nearly did) enjoying majority time of idleness; instead, I (like most) chose a more frantic life of productivity (and sometimes gap-filling) so I could enjoy relatively luxurious goods & services with the swipe of a card. Force redistribution to impose the social structure & values the interviewee wants, and methinks most of us would rebel at the results; we&#x27;re <i>not</i> living that way for a reason.",1401832704

Because, you know, words mean things, and like &quot;Off the record&quot;, that means something else.\nI&#x27;m surprised Google weren&#x27;t willing to spend the internal security resources on end-to-end to be able to stand behind it at time of release.\nAll told, it pretty much smells like &quot;keep engineers happy&quot; + &quot;win points with the net freedom community as cheaply as possible.&quot;\nGoogle, if they wanted to, could do some pretty revolutionary stuff in the secure comms space, but that would cost actual cash.\nSsh, no one wants to talk about how Silicon Valley business models depend on surveillance.<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/Dymaxion"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/Dymaxion</a>",1401832550

Suppose we want to increase the minimum wage by at least $5/hour. Let&#x27;s see if that&#x27;s possible without &quot;cutting back&quot;:<p>McDonald&#x27;s has 1,800,000 employees and makes 5.46 billion in profit. Divide the latter by the former and you&#x27;ll see that their profit is $3,033/employee. If they gave ALL the profit to the workers in the form of higher wages and divided it equally among the workers, that&#x27;s how much of a raise they could afford to give without doing any &quot;cutting back&quot;: ~$3k/year.<p>A 40 hour workweek is about 2000 hours per year, so that means if they didn&#x27;t save ANY profit to give back to investors or invest in the growth of the business or set aside against losses in bad years, out of profits they could afford to give their full-time workers a raise of: $1.50/hour.<p>Any more than that, and they have to cut back.<p>But wait, you say! What about bloated CEO salaries?<p>Huffington post says the incoming CEO of McDonalds recently got paid ~$14 million and the outgoing one got ~$28 million.\n(source: <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/12/mcdonalds-ceo-pay_n_3070833.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/12/mcdonalds-ceo-pay_n...</a> ). Let&#x27;s add those together and round the total WAY up to $50 million dollars. Let&#x27;s assume they can save $50 million dollars by not paying CEOs or ex-CEOs (and a couple other high administrators) anything, and distribute the savings to the workers as higher salary.<p>$50 million / 1.8 million = $27.8. So by eliminating those top salaries we could give every worker an extra 27.8 dollars per YEAR. Divide that by 2000 and you&#x27;ll see we can afford to give each full-time worker an additional raise of roughly: 1.4 CENTS per hour.<p>Conclusion: doubling the minimum wage (or bumping it by $5, or anything in that ballpark) can&#x27;t be done out of profits or out of cutting top salaries.

There are a couple of studies in this vein, but one from Baylor shows that people in groups punish others who are more generous, even when the generosity benefits everyone[1].<p>The author makes an interesting point about people who dislike their work begrudging people who do meaningful things (in their judgement).  Throughout our history, we have had an idealized vision of the average American in the back of our heads -- first it was the farmer, creating food for their family.  Then it became the factory worker, creating cars for the masses -- now it may be the programmer, making the software that powers our world.<p>The interesting thread here is creation.  We live in a country that idealizes making things and taking risk/responsibility.  Yet society is heavily geared towards conformity, and work is an extension of that.  Even tech startups are increasingly becoming a systematic, codified industry.  Is it no wonder that there is some resentment of people who are perceived to truly be free to create?<p>This is why something like basic income[2] is so interesting.  Once we are freed from having to conform to society in order to meet our basic needs, what will we be able to do?

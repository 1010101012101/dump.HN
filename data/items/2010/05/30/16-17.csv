1390721,comment,1390599,1390599,0,0,sidyadav,,,"I built a service that followed a similar trajectory (memiary.com) a couple years ago. Here are a few things I learnt which I might help:<p>- Some services aren't meant to be taken to 'the next level'. You should weigh its opportunity and make the appropriate decision. For me, it was to realize that I'd built something 'timeless' that didn't need next-levelling and re-iteration, so I chose to leave it like it is and be content with its 2,000+ daily users. I figured I'd spend my time on other things that had a bigger inherent opportunity than beat a horse that just fundamentally isn't inclined to go far enough.<p>- When it comes to making money, there are 2 basic options services like ours have: donations and iPhone app. I was lucky to have built a fantastic userbase from the get-go, so the same people who purchased my iPhone app also have given around $600 - $700 in donations when I've requested for it. Sure, it's no major money, but it's enough to support my time and energy and hosting costs, and I'm content with it.<p>- Appreciate your trickled traffic. I noticed today that 2,000 people have been using my service EVERY DAY for the last 2 years. That means something to me. Not every service is supposed to be a pageview-generating machine. What's important to me is that 2,000 people take the time to go to my website and write down their private thoughts every day. I'd rather have this than 10,000 meaningless pageviews from Google.",1275238591
1390720,comment,1390485,1390485,0,0,commieneko,,,"There are really very few rules or useful generalizations, at least yet. The game is still very new.  And much depends not on the properties of a class, which are still _very_ fuzzy, but on the specifics of a particular implementation.<p>For example, the Facebook app for the iphone is in many ways a better experience compared to the web site.  This is more of an indictment against the website, which is simply, and unutterably horrible, no matter how useful or fun it might be to many people.  (The lesson here would seem to be that killer content/functionality trumps nearly any other consideration.)<p>And for reading the web I often use NetNewsWire, an app that is an RSS reader with its own built in browser.  Does that count as an app or as a browser?  This is much better than any of the browsers with built in RSS readers. Again, how does that count.<p>edit: When I examine my own usage, I consume books, comics, manga, music, and video in special purpose apps.  For mainstream news I usually use a web based aggregator (Google News.) An exception is The New York Times which has a very nice iPhone/iPod Touch app that is great and as a bonus buffers a days content so that I can read when I'm offline.  If magazine publishers were looking for a model that app would be a nice place to start.  For NewZ (blogs, aggregators, etc.) I use an RSS reader and then a web browser to pick up stuff like Hacker News, Reddit, or Slashdot that would simply bloat an RSS reader.  I have tried apps to follow Reddit and Hack News, and on the iPhone/iPod Touch they rock.  On the iPad the experience is a mixed bag.",1275238545

1390713,comment,1389499,1390045,0,0,Silhouette,,,"> I am pretty amazed by your use of scare quotes around the words ""rights"" and ""own"". It's almost like you are mocking people who expect to be able to buy things, and then own them.<p>This is the thing that concerns me the most about the current battle between pirates and Big Media.<p>The pirate side likes to point out that copyright infringement is not theft. A ripped copy does not imply a lost sale, they say, and of course there is some truth in that.<p>However, these arguments are based on the fact that we are now dealing with pure information products rather than physical products that happen to contain the information. The other side of that distinction is if you no longer buy a physical product, you no longer have something you can keep and use as you see fit. Instead, you are only paying for a service, which provides information with certain controls and under certain conditions.<p>It is natural that people who put a lot of money into developing this information will react in this way, and clearly for now a lot of people are willing to sign up to on-line music services, games services, etc. But we are drifting into a world where the industry Powers That Be are going to hide <i>everything</i> behind rental models, and it will no longer be possible to buy an open-ended, use-it-as-you-like version of information products. When they switch the servers off, it's gone. If you move account, it's gone, and you have to pay again on your new service, just like when they went from LPs to tapes to CDs.<p>I'm not sure that is a healthy direction to move in, but as long as significant numbers insist on breaking the law and ripping off others' hard work, that's the direction that market forces will push. If, as some artists believe, there is more upside than downside to allowing open sharing of works, then they will be free to continue releasing things on that basis, and time will tell whether they are right. But for an article that keeps talking about having no evidence for illegal downloads causing a reduction in sales, it is assuming a lot about a culture that shares freely that is also not really supported by evidence yet.",1275238362

The article says that's what most economists use, but it's not automatically better - and density is a bit loose of a concept anyway.<p>I'd say it comes down to whether you're interested in a bounded product (infrastructure) or an unbounded one (innovation).

1390706,comment,1390594,1390594,0,0,wyattpeak,,,"Simply moving to Linux isn't liable to significantly help or hinder your programming. These days Linux, provided you choose a distribution with a GUI, is pretty well as comfortable to use as Windows - not quite as refined, but the differences are slight.<p>There are two real advantages - more command prompt access to applications, which allows you to avoid the mouse and GUI interaction in general, and a better selection of code editors.<p>vi, one of the more popular text editors, in particular I find speeds up my work, but I strongly advise against asking for the relative merits of different editors - it's a sore point and is liable to start a flame war. The other editor with a significant following is Emacs.<p>Both of these do have a very steep learning curve, but with the amount of software available these days on linux, if you're having trouble, you can always find something a bit closer to home. For a while while getting used to the system I used Geany, which is more of an IDE than a text editor, and largely defeated the purpose of moving to Ubuntu, but it nevertheless eased the transition.<p>As indicated, I do suggest Ubuntu, which I think is the best developed and most usable system, not to mention having the largest userbase and hence array of help and software.<p>You'll find it a bit off-putting for a minute, a number of aspects, particularly installing software, aren't exactly designed for ease of use, but push through. In a week or so you'll be comfortable enough to live with it, and in a month or two you'll be familiar enough to make a sound judgement between the two.<p>One note - one of the killers which kept me from using Linux for years was the lack of driver support. In particular I could never get my wireless card working, which rendered it a non-starter. This seems to have been cleared up as of ubuntu 9.10, but I'm finding some of the trouble over again with 10.04, the latest release. I don't know if it's hardware-specfic or just an issue with the operating system, since it's still in early days, but try 9.10 if 10.04 doesn't work.",1275238095

Among other \n  objectives, the Phobos flybys are designed to provide \n  clues towards answering this question.\n</code></pre>\nSo one of the three hypotheses has been ruled out.

There may be thousands of coins laying in the sand, but how can I possibly scale finding them all? People (personalities) that may benefit from the tool don't know to look for it, and it's not like something you would share with all your friends (e.g. viral). Thus, I don't see how to grow it.<p>Feature wise, we're using Get Satsifaction, and have had a decent amount of feedback. Most common features are things like making apps (mobile/desktop), APIs or integration (e.g. with RTM) -- these things make sense. Then there is another class of feedback which is like ""add priorities"" ""let me see my tasks"" ""add recurring tasks"" etc. These don't make any sense to me because there are already apps that perfectly fulfill those needs if people have them.<p>Measurement wise, I'm only really tracking ""active"" users (and tasks entered/completed etc). There's just so little to do, that I don't know if there is any action to take based on it. Anyway, the bigger problem is traffic. Only ~30% or so of my traffic are new visitors. It's really just beginning to boil down to a group of dedicated users and no traffic driving for new visitors.",1275236884

Most modern lisps have less matched decoration and only slightly (1-2 levels more) nesting that algol-derivative languages.<p>As far as I can tell, the sole real point in the “lisp syntax sucks” camp is that prefix arithmetic is unfamiliar. Which may be true (although it is more regular), but how often do people really sit around writing a lot of arithmetic code? For the vast majority of dock-this-with-that programmers, lots of +-*/ arithmetic is rare.",1275236829
1390669,comment,1390524,1390524,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"The discussion around criteria might be useful. Yet another language thread probably is not.<p>The interesting things that I noted about criteria is that there wasn't a direct mention of installed userbase: languages with a million users have a tendency to have tremendous resources available while ones with small userbases have a tendency to have support limited to a few high priests.<p>Also I noted that many of these questions are dealt with in a yes/no fashion when in fact it's a relative thing. So, for instance, F# may run on mono which gives it cross-platform support, but performance might not be as good, which was enough to eliminate it here. I would have been happier if F# was given partial credit here. I'm sure that observation is true of some of the other points the author makes. It would have been better to use a weighted matrix.",1275236827

Fundamentally, this treatment is a textbook case of applied RNA interference (RNAi).  While it is really awesome to see RNAi used in a medical context (these nano-payloads of RNA are really interesting), all the caveats of RNAi apply.<p>If the virus has a highly variable DNA sequence, different RNAi sequences will need to be designed, validated, and grown up in lab for each viral strain.  Viral strains will need to be identified upon infection so the right RNAi sequences are used, which can increase time until treatment.  We won't be seeing this technique used on a highly variable virus like HIV or the common cold anytime soon, because these viruses mutate incredibly quickly within the host.",1275236781

This is where I like the geeky preference voting instead of yes/no, because it includes motivational nuance. The scale is:<p><pre><code>  +1 strong yes\n  +0 ambivalent, prefer yes\n   0 ambivalent\n  -0 ambivalent, prefer no\n  -1 strong no\n</code></pre>\nin this case I would put +0 as I don't want them to fail and leave me unemployed, but I can't put +1 because more success means more customers and we can't scale customers without more effort, so more success means more work and stress for the same pay, which is worse for me.<p>My ideal is enough customers to keep us afloat, minimum viable effort, the company's ideal is max customers everyone at full effort, max profit.

It goes on up to a default position of being against regulation on almost everything -- against sarbox on principle, not just the implementation, against regulations regarding offshore drilling most likely until 4 weeks ago and now they're re-evaluating.

7434602,comment,7434554,7434554,21,0,justincormack,,,"I have been using Musl for various purposes for quite some time. I think my favourite things are:<p>* The team are very helpful, and fix things fast and correctly. You can see some of the detail in this post on race conditions in glibc <a href=""http://ewontfix.com/16/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ewontfix.com/16/</a><p>* It is very standards compliant, so it is a good portability test for your code. It is a bit like using a BSD libc, except it does have Linux specific syscalls etc.<p>* Static linking works, which it doesnt properly in glibc. If you want to be like those trendy Go people and provide simple statically linked single file binaries, for running in containers etc then you can. And they will be small: the glibc shared library is 1.8MB (not including rt, pthread etc), while a Musl statically linked copy of Lua for example is only 160k. Static linking is very useful for all sorts of things, my most recent use was cross compiling bianries to run under qemu-user for testing.<p>* It is BSD licensed so you can use it in completely different projects however you want, eg OSv uses it <a href=""http://osv.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://osv.io/</a><p>* The code is small and readable. If you want to know how things work you can just take a look, quickly find the code and understand it. Just finding the code in glibc takes ages. I keep a reference copy just for this purpose.<p>You can use the &quot;cross compiler&quot; musl-gcc that ships with it to build if your code is happy being cross compiled (should be, most things just work). If you have a lot of dependencies it might be easier to use a distro, I use Sabotage in a chroot usually <a href=""https://github.com/sabotage-linux/sabotage"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/sabotage-linux/sabotage</a>",1395309005

7434582,comment,7428469,7434228,1,0,mattmanser,,,"Reducing the round trips to the DB or doing calculations when you need them need no knowledge <i>AT ALL</i> of algos.<p>Saying it&#x27;s &quot;I/O&quot; is so abstract and ultimately <i>useless</i>. A simple SQL query could hold a dark secret of a missing index on a table with a billion rows. Yes, that&#x27;s technically I/O, but for today&#x27;s programming that&#x27;s so obtusely abstract it&#x27;s pointless calling it that. It&#x27;s a couple of lines of code that all the algo knowledge in the world won&#x27;t have stopped the problem happening.<p>It&#x27;s simply common sense. This is what we&#x27;re trying to tell you. This is what we&#x27;re trying to explain to you. Performance problems are almost always unintended consequences rather than &quot;I&#x27;ll suck it and see&quot;. Knowing how to implement the sort yourself won&#x27;t save you, you have to spot the problem first, which is the hard part.<p>Basic multiplication is not algos. Knowing that a 100 loops of a thousand loops of a 1ms method is bad doesn&#x27;t require magical knowledge. Algorithms was always a smoke and mirror trick, the ones you need are usually already in your language written much better than you could and the rest simply hides the truth that performance is mainly down to unexpected I/O bottlenecks usually buried under many layers of abstraction (SQL) or the occasional loop within a loop hidden in a long call stack.",1395308555

This helps me time my escape breaks where I just get away from work, colleagues, the city for 4-5 days and come back refreshed with energy, motivation and capacity to get more work done. I hope something like this could help you in future too.<p>Fresh out of college, I first burnt out at a BigCo. Next three months I couldn't work at all, I'd wake up every day and sit around reading HN or generally wasting time. My employer then was understanding enough to let me go. I work at a startup now but I sense an impending doom due to mismatch of my values and co-founders'. I dislike the lack of creativity around they way they're doing business and lack of appropriate shares for who brings what to the table. And also dislike the over-valuedness of ideas over execution. Having worked here 8 months on unfulfilled promises of profit-sharing, even when we have many customers now, I see it pointless to continue. I leave in a few months. Thereupon I plan a short break and am going to work on a few of my own ideas full time. This seems the most fulfilling way forward.",1336496272

3944542,comment,3934183,3936733,1,0,grey413,,,"It's a tradeoff. Django is a full-stack framework, which integrates lots of components such as templates, form generation, and an ORM. This means that you can get off the ground quicker, and that the community is all more or less on the same page. The downside is that if you want to do something that Django isn't good at (complicated database stuff, logic in templates, etc), you are in for a world of pain (reportedly). Overall, Django is a great default for making CMS-type sites, but can become a technical debt if your requirements outgrow it.<p>Pyramid, on the other hand, deliberately not a full stack framework, sacrificing ease-of-use for flexibility. It doesn't include any database opinions at all, can swap templating languages on a whim and wouldn't know a form if you hit it over the head with one. The upside is that it has first class core components, really well defined extension points, an unmatched routing system, and a few truly excellent plugins (I love you pyramid_tm). The downside, of course, is that you will own your entire stack, which means that A) there is more up-front work researching, designing, and developing your application's component stack and B) there's no central community guaranteed to be using the same stack as you. Overall, pyramid is suited for essentially any use case, so long as you put the work into it.<p>tldr: Django is (somewhat) inflexible but easy, Pyramid is flexible but more demanding.

3944539,comment,3940073,3942996,1,0,justinjlynn,,,"You make a good point. Conversely, a part of basic security policies is to present as little attack surface as possible. Ensuring that you're not trusting local connections with root equivalent access to your database is a good way of doing that. Modern GNU/Linux distributions have many thousands of packages installed, some of which with fairly open Internet access. Could you put up a default deny firewall to prevent that? Yes. Given that, in most systems there will always be holes punched in those firewalls which allow attacks through as those machines are typically used to serve traffic and do actual work. If you are exploited by a vulnerability in some random package you have installed then you /will/ have potentially multiple /untrusted/ and /hostile/ users on your system. Now, assuming there isn't a local privilege escalation attack to which your kernel is vulnerable, they'll be looking for services which treat local sockets as trusted and attempt to bootstrap from there. A vital concept of basic security precautions is that one doesn't just prevent attacks through secure defaults and front-line security precautions (i.e. firewalls), but one must both contain and detect successful penetrations when they do occur. You must have defence in depth, and not just a hard shell of security, because you can never really tell which one of those protective safeguards will fail due to bugs, human error, or technical incompetence.",1336495840

3944509,comment,3943201,3943201,15,0,joeyh,,,"Here I've translated the example to haskell:<p><pre><code>    data Exchange = Exchange { bic :: String, name :: String }\n    data Security = Security { description :: String, exchange :: Exchange, isin :: String }\n    data Stock = Stock { security :: Security }\n    data Bond = Bond { security :: Security, expiry :: EpochTime }\n    data Trade = Trade { price :: Decimal, quantity :: Decimal, security :: Security }\n</code></pre>\nNow to add Option:<p><pre><code>    data Option = Option { security :: Security, call :: Bool, lotSize :: Decimal, maturity :: EpochTime, strikePrice :: Decimal }\n</code></pre>\nAnd in the example, the problem is that the Option uses Security, which has an isin, which doesn't make sense for Option. In haskell, this is a sort of problem which is typically fixed by adjusting the data types. There are many\nways they could be changed, some will model the domain better than others. Let's just make the same quick fix used in the example, of allowing isin to not be set:<p><pre><code>    data Security = Security { description :: String, exchange :: Exchange, isin :: Maybe String }\n</code></pre>\nThis means that isin is Nothing or Just a String. As soon as this change is made, every place in the program that directly accessed the isin will fail to compile. Fixing the compilation errors will involve adding a case to handle\nisin-less Securities.<p><pre><code>    - foo (Security { isin = i }) = \n    + foo (Security { isin = Just i }) = ...\n    + foo (Security { isin = Nothing }) = ...\n</code></pre>\nThe code does become somewhat ugly with these cases, but you know every case has been covered, and that it will work.<p>Maybe later it's decided to go back and fix it to use the separation between physical and derivative securities that was originally considered but not done due to lack of time. It could then look like this:<p><pre><code>    data Security = PhysicalSecurity { description :: String, exchange :: Exchange, isin :: String } \n                  | DerivativeSecurity { description :: String, exchange :: Exchange }\n</code></pre>\nAgain this type change would drive a pass through the code, fixing it up to compile.<p><pre><code>    foo (PhysicalSecurity { isin = i }) = ...\n    foo (DerivativeSecurity {}) = ...\n</code></pre>\nAgain you'll know when you're done because the program will successfully compile. In this case, splitting the data type seems to have led to better,\nclearer code. It might be worthwhile to factor out a helper type to simplify the Security type:<p><pre><code>    data SecurityBase = SecurityBase { description :: String, exchange :: Exchange }\n    data Security = PhysicalSecurity { base :: SecurityBase, isin :: String }\n                  | DerivativeSecurity { base :: SecurityBase }\n</code></pre>\nAlthough you may find this complicates other things as you ""follow the types""\nand change the code to match. There are surely other approaches; so far this has stuck with simple data types, but typeclasses could also be used. You may want to constrain Bonds to using a PhysicalSecurity, and Options to using a DerivativeSecurity, and there are various ways that could be enforced. And so on.<p>What was surprising to me coming to haskell from a background in loosely typed languages (and lowlevel langs like C) is that the types are not a straightjacket that is set in stone from the start, but ebb and flow as you refine your understanding of the problem domain. What well chosen types in haskell do constrain is the mistakes you want to be prevented from making. These days if I find myself repeatedly making a mistake in my code, I adjust the types to prevent that sort of mistake in the future.<p>---<p>Side note: The above code will not compile as written, because it exposes an annoying problem in haskell's record syntax. There are several fields named ""security"" that conflict with one-another. This is typically dealt with by using\nugly field names (stockSecurity, bondSecurity, tradeSecurity, optionSecurity), or more advanced things like lenses, or by putting the data types in separate modules and using module namespacing.",1336495471

Why long?  Because, for big-O asymptotics to kick in, you'll need large n.<p>But, the domain of applicability seems to be a niche.  The ""7 non-negligible coefficients"" result you refer to is for 8x8 DCT's (as in JPEG).  That's n = 8.  There are optimized implementations for the small-n cases that will utterly dominate a big-O optimal algorithm like this.  Compare Strassen's algorithm for matrix *.<p>Have you looked at the code complexity of the algorithm in the paper?  There are several interlocking components (hash functions, rebinning) that have their own big-O optimality claims and, in some cases, randomization.  Getting it all to work together efficiently, given cache issues, even for large n (say, 10^6) would be a serious engineering challenge.

MVC was a pattern created for making GUI apps in smalltalk in the 70s/80s.  It has gradually been warped and twisted since then, especially when people tried to cludge it onto web development.  The resulting thing doesn't really resemble MVC at all, and certainly doesn't deliver the benefits MVC was created to deliver.<p>MVC is a triangle, rails style frameworks are a line.  This is called MVA (Model-View-Adapter).  The ""adapter"" being in between the view and the model who can only interact with the adapter and not each other.  The second issue is that in adapting MVC to the web, many frameworks continued with the ""one controller per view"" notion, despite that being done because of the limitations imposed when creating GUI apps.  There is no need for multiple controllers in a web app, all input comes in the same way no matter what view the user is seeing.  In fact, the user doesn't even need to be seeing a view, there is nothing tying a view to what actions are possible, you can always submit any http request you want.  Your ""routes"" are your controller, there is no need for a second level of controllers on top of that.<p>The goal of MVC was to expose model functionality to the user directly so they could understand and work with the domain model clearly and easily.  Controller meant ""controls the input and output"" not ""controls the users experience"".  The guy who created MVC considers naked objects style frameworks to be the closest thing to MVC for the web, not rails style MVA frameworks.<p>And there is something very weird about this statement:<p>>On top of that, its very common to see logic pushed down into the model<p>Of course that is common, that is what is supposed to happen.  Models are not ""stupid containers to pretend to kinda represent my DB sorta but not really"".  Models are the business logic.  Models are the actual application.  You are modelling the domain, not modelling the database.  The model is the domain, it is all the business logic.  The view is the way we present information to the user.  The controller is the part that handles input and output.  Very simple and effective system, but very poorly understood and virtually never used any more.",1336494133

If you gave one away for every 1000 people, you'd be paying $2 per person to try out your product.

There was the DOD Ada mandate and over the years there were some interesting studies showing reliability differences between Ada and C++,  but also in hopes of keeping costs lower, they use C and C++ in a lot of that stuff now so that they can use off the shelf software libraries and such.  That says a lot,  the ability to hire people and develop with some velocity matters too.  Language won't make a shitty architecture good.  Language won't make a shitty team good, either.<p>Fundamentally, if you pay attention to where this stuff matters most,  Ada has to be a standout choice but those industries don't change, they don't adopt new stuff and the whole process by which that happens in them isn't one that results in the best technology, it's one that results in a consensus technology.  The risk of a line of code knocking a plane down or letting the missile hit the wrong target are just fundamentally different than letting someone log in to a web site; maybe they shouldn't be but the very culture difference between those groups is huge and so you can look at them and say ""ah, we should use Ada too, 'it's safer'""  but that is probably not a great business decision.

I ended up taking off about 6 months and then pin-balled through a couple companies before finding something that makes me feel like Im on the road to being back on my feet.  From that experience here is my 2 cents.<p>### If you are already burnt out, I would absolutely avoid the following...<p>- A startup that is doing something that is not all that exciting to you (no matter how cool the company is or how great their potential is)<p>- A big co. in the same industry as your past company (while not always, competing companies in the same segment tend to usually have similar operating procedures)<p>- Any company under financial pressure... that could be an over-promising startup with not enough funding/revenue or a big co. that is starting to tilt in the wrong direction.<p>### What I would suggest:<p>- If possible, any company that is doing something you find exciting.  I'd probably lean more towards a larger organization in that the risk of getting doubly burnt out in a startup is probably higher.  If it isn't somehow interesting or exciting, don't take it or quit after a week of trying it out.  Also look at non-SV type companies.  There are lots of interesting opportunities for technical folks in energy, education, etc. that after years of working on the typical startup stuff I've realized is way more interesting to me.",1336493958

Perhaps in my simplified example that's something you could pick up on before work commenced, but in reality there are many little (and sometimes big) things which you either miss no matter how hard you try, or change later on.<p>The problem with your suggestions as to <i>fixing</i> the hierarchy is that, yes this is something you ought to do and it resolves the problem, but it takes <i>time</i> and is in essence yak shaving, or at least feels that way - are you really working towards making your software better, or are you just pandering to the abstraction you've created?<p>In any case, this is one of the 2 options I suggest to resolve the situation, and definitely the correct one (I cover the idea of separating out ISIN and non-ISIN instruments as e.g. physical/derivative), however it takes <i>time</i> and the problem is it is so often the case that time pressures result in you hacking around the problem, making the hierarchy not only incorrect, but actively misleading.<p>I didn't mean to suggest dynamic languages were a silver bullet here, nor did I mean to put particular emphasis on them.<p>No matter what you will have to refactor, but the question is whether a rigid hierarchy makes that more or less difficult, and whether that rigidity tempts you into hacks which make this structure misleading.<p>I think the problem with putting any particular example in the article is that it will inevitably be inadequate for its purpose.

I know it doesnt solve any problem, doesnt make anyones life easier or make the world a better place, and obviously there is a questionable educational value in it. Said that, I have been recently laid off from a company (in NYC) that is going under, and wanted to brush up a bit on my programming skills, as for couple years now Ive been mostly managing IT projects and truly missed designing and developing software big time.<p>DrawSomethingNaughty was designed with PHP, HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript and JQuery, plus MySql. It took one full week of time. Canvas were something I wanted to learn the most, and obviously learnt a lot new experience designing for web on mobile devices: Android and IOS (I dont believe this ""app"" would be approved in the store; thats why I took extra care of trying to make a touch device experience in the browser as flawless as possible). Programming-wise IOS was more pleasant than Android, and there is still a glitch in drawing on the latter. I failed miserably on CSS layering. I just dont get it, wasted one day and at some point decided to cheat and go back to tables. Another fail (although bit controlled) was with MVP - that urge to keep adding features before getting first user. I did however keep noting all future improvements and add-ons on the side (my mind really went wild and I hope to see some of those popping up from Zynga anytime now, as there is a huge monetization potential no way related to annoying users with ads), has this game gain some reasonable traction.<p>Now, obvious question is how much of a rip off of DrawSomething this is and whether Zynga will be urged to go after me. I spent some time on this one, weighted for and against, and decided to continue project consequently. For obvious reasons (hello Zynga lawyers!), I am gonna leave the list I came up with out of this post, and wont comment on it. I also did some trademark research, and couldnt find anything on ""Draw Something"", even though this is not the name of my project.<p>DrawSomethingNaughty was tested against Samsung Galaxy i977, iOS Phone/Pad/Pod and it came up pretty playable. But if you see something wrong on your device, please post it here, or send a screenshot with name of your device to screenshot@drawsomethingnaughty.com<p>Anything else, please ask.<p>Thanks for reading.<p>ps: I have been reading HN and commenting a bit for a while now, but again because of the idea behind this is not that cool (""oh, I designed that app for people to draw dicks and learn cursewords""), I decided to post it under a new account.

The only people ""on call"" are the CTO and myself (the ops guy). You might get a phone call if your project explodes in production, but I think that is reasonable in any work environment.<p>Shoot me an email at dessyohtiav@dunflimblag.mailexpire.com if you are interested in working at a sane startup.",1336493101

Is it the environment, the lack of recognition, the colleagues, lack of challenge, or it may just be simply you are actually needing a break.<p>If it is the last one, going to a startup isn't going to change things.<p>That said, not all startups are the 7-day a week, sleep under your desk slog.  But, there are ones that are -- sometimes it is because you are all young, trying to run, and want to do so; other times it can be for reasons as you experienced -- poor management and poor planning.  I've experienced both, and walked away from the latter when I realized it was the best thing for me.<p>If you are in an area with a diverse startup ecosystem, get out there and talk to people.  Identify companies that might be interesting for you, network a bit, and see if you can engage the people in a conversation about their companies in a social (rather than interview) environment. Try and find out what the environment is like, how management treats the individual contributors, etc.<p>That said, startups will generally take more time and may be more challenging than a larger company.  If, however, you are working with people you like and on something you enjoy, it may not be as noticeable.<p>All the same, as others have mentioned, there are startups out there where people do have life/work balances.  For instance, Treehouse was mentioned last month -- <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3883268"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3883268</a><p>Take the time to identify what you want and the type of people you want to work with, do some leg work, and see how it goes.

3944281,comment,3943824,3943824,60,0,michaelochurch,,,"Shitty jobs happen. People don't always admit to them, but they're common. A lot of the most successful people seem to have pristine careers and nothing bad to say about any company where they've worked. That's called rewriting history. People <i>want</i> to be perceived as having an unbroken string of successes, but almost no one this in their actual track record. You had a bad job, and now you're depleted, and you probably think your situation is a lot worse than it actually is. No. This is not unusual, and I think 90% of the people reading this thought, ""man, that could have been me at one time"".<p>You're not ""damaged"" because you had a terrible job. This is as common as dirt. Don't take it personally and don't let it affect you emotionally. Almost everyone has had one. If you can afford to take two months off to do recover, do so. If not, then find a job that will allow you to work 9-to-5 and recover on your own time.<p>On work hours: most startups will have <i>occasional</i> spikes, but well-managed ones will try to keep a 40-45 hour per week average. When people are working 70 hours per week, the quality of work deteriorates quickly. It's a really short-sighted strategy. There are a lot of startups that push people to work 70 hours, but most of those are going to crash and burn.<p>Also, what happens to most people as they get older is that they have mostly negative work experiences, because most companies are badly managed, and they learn things to avoid. People learn things with experience like, ""Working 70 hours per week for months on end doesn't actually work out well."" IMO, that's what the 20s, for the smartest people, are actually about: watching people in power fuck up so you know what not to do when you're in charge. Eventually, you'll be in a position to do things properly. It might take a while.<p>Some things to avoid, going forward: (1) Don't take jobs where the company isn't willing to tell you what you'll be working on. That usually means you're going to be allocated to the least desirable projects. (2) Stay away from the VC darlings, which have (as of 2012, mid-bubble) been infested in MBA culture and are companies in which you're likely to get some insultingly low (~0.01% equity) ""profit sharing"" offer while making 60 percent of market salary. (3) Don't take an offer just because it's ""a startup"". Most of these hot startups won't exist in 5 years. Evaluate the job based on the people you'll be working with and the type of work you'll get, not the size of the company. (4) Don't think you're desperate or that your negative experience makes you less qualified for the types of jobs you actually want. Negative experiences are very common, and it gets easier to recover from them as you get older. (5) On job interviews, don't discuss the negative experiences or the bad employer. At all. Bad job experiences are too common to deserve the ""silent shame"" stigma, but nonetheless, a job interview is just not the place for that. Keep the conversation positive and focused on the future.<p>For the record, I don't think it actually matters what size of company you work for. There are groups within large companies doing amazing things, and there are awful startups. ""Bureaucracy"", in the toxic (rather than mildly annoying) sense, is about power dynamics and I've seen dysfunctional relationships in small companies and much as large. In 2006, it was pretty clear that startups were the place to go if you wanted to learn a lot quickly, because we were coming off a bust, startups were undervalued by labor as much as investors, and there were a lot of challenging technical problems in small companies. I don't think that's as true now as it was then. In Real Technology, yes, that's still true; but most of these VC darlings in ""social media"" are a joke and you won't learn much in them.<p>What seems to be a trend, in 2012, is that a lot of large companies are developing small and mostly-autonomous groups that I think of as akin to ""honors colleges"" in order to get a level of talent that would otherwise go exclusively to academia, finance, and startups. Right now, I think the VC startup scene is played out and these honors colleges are a better avenue.",1336492828

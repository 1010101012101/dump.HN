The regulator is responsible for updating the standard as needed, and for taking reports from people who receive a robocall, and for imposing sanctions on companies who i) do the robocalling and ii) ask other companies to do the robocalling for them.<p>Sanctions include fines for the companies; potential prison time for the directors of those companies (obviously this would need to go through court) and 'blocking of numbers by telecom companies' (not sure how realistic that is.<p>The regulator has an ""opt out"" list.  Every one with a phone who doesn't want to receive calls registers on that list.  New numbers are added by default.  (They can maintain an ""Opt in"" list, so people who want to receive junk calls can).<p>Then the regulators set up a website.

Custom libraries just for the mac (custom libev??), needing to install XCode Dev Tools to get gcc compiler(???). Sigh.</i><p>For the last year or so you don't need to install XCode to get Apple's gcc, there is a separate ""Command Line Tools"" ~120MB download with gcc and all that stuff.<p>Still, I don't see the ""hell"" even if you still HAD to install XCode to get gcc. My definition of hell doesn't include getting a nice IDE, with one click installation, and tons of tools and documentation in the process of getting my barebones C compiler.<p>><i>In the end I just ended up running a CentOS VM in virtualbox, and I do my development there.</i><p>Which is the smart thing to do, anyway. Get the dev environment to be like the deployment platform. Except for simple coding, why would anyone want to mess his basic system with webservers, databases, competing libraries and stuff, when he can have a clean base system and a multiple virtual development systems, with snapshots?<p>Even when I run Linux (with KDE) as my desktop, I still used a VMWare virtual machine for developing in.<p>><i>The ONLY benefit I currently gain from a Mac is creating iOS apps.</i><p>Well, maybe you don't need a Mac then. If you need any of the following though, you might get more from one:<p>1) Minimal fuss setup, including things like audio, 3D acceleration, video, sleep mode, printing, etc.<p>2) The ability to run MS Office, Adobe Creative Suite, AutoCAD and numerous other commercial products (and all Open Source stuff too).<p>3) The ability to edit your vacation video (or a full documentary) without tearing your hair out.<p>4) The ability to work with Pro Audio / MIDI / plugins, period.<p>Now, if all you do is browser, see mail, and edit some C, then why would you need a Mac for? Hell, if a Chromebook has an SSH client, you might not even need a Linux desktop for that.",1350638388

I really liked Daniel Craig's take on the character. Unfortunately then came ""Quantum of Solace""; let's hope ""Skyfall"" will have a better story.<p>> <i>We don't have to talk about Lazenby and Dalton.

In a traditional B-tree with a 8KiB block size and assuming links take 8 bytes too and assume for a while that blocks are completely full.

4606028,comment,4605436,4605762,1,0,rm999,,,"I am not an expert in SVMs, but I consider myself fairly experienced in machine learning. In my professional experience the answer to your question is 'not quite'. SVMs have solved some problems very well, but I've had issues with them:<p>1. They are only for classification, not every problem is classification. The other big category is regression, for example predicting the sale price of a home rather than predicting a binary ""will it sell""<p>2. They don't have a natural probabilistic interpretation for classification. Neural networks for classification (with a logistic activation function) are trained to predict a probability, not make a simple binary decision. In practice this probability is usually very useful, although I believe SVMs have been modified to give some kind of probability.<p>3. I have had a tough time getting them to run quickly. Linear kernel SVMs are fast, but aren't powerful. More complex kernels are more powerful but can be very slow on moderately large datasets.",1349243303

4606017,comment,4604555,4605735,1,0,knieveltech,,,"1. Site adoption rates, especially in the enterprise space. You're absolutely right, the developer community isn't growing, and I think the blame for that lies squarely with the core codebase's deathmarch towards becoming Sharepoint. There was a point in time (circa D5, early D6) when coding with Drupal was still kinda fun. Core architecture didn't get in the way as much.<p>2. There are user groups, I've organized two of them. They are frequently full of people who have basic problems and a few exasperated and grizzly veterans who offer arcane solutions to non-arcane problems. Best outcomes typically occur when one or more local dev shops get involved with the group and use community support as a way to build their brand. Anecdotally this describes most tech user groups.<p>3. Yes, this is a feature. It's objectively better because you are not writing code.
In addition to the obvious benefits (no fucking code) this puts the task at hand (at least theoretically) within the reach of non-technical or semi-technical individuals.<p>4. I dislike Drupal's internals for diverse and varied reasons I will not go into here. I dislike Wordpress's internals for many of the same reasons, and Wordpress is substantially more limited in it's capabilities than Drupal.   Same general set of problems, many fewer features.<p>Also, I agree Drupal's documentation sucks hard. Unfortunately there's nothing to be done about it. It would take close to 10,000 man-hours to write shitty, blatantly misinformed documentation for the current body of contributed modules, assuming you budgeted 30 minutes to examine the module and 30 minutes to write about it.",1349243051

Wow, that device must have a lot of torque as many deadbolts, mine for example, actually requires some effort to turn, either to lock or unlock. This resistance is caused mainly by the springiness of the weather stripping which pushes back against the door when it is closed.<p>2. Sometimes, when sunlight falls uponand heatsthe door I need to push or pull slightly on the door in order to turn the deadbolt at all. The door is not dimensionally stable and deadbolt alignment changes. This makes me think that the system would not be reliable. I know my door and deadbolt are not unique in this regard.",1349243034

4606011,comment,4605904,4605962,17,0,machrider,,,"Yeah, I can't stand infinite scroll pages. It becomes impossible to pass a link to someone to a specific section of entries.  It generally breaks the back button -- when I click a link and then go back to an infinite scroll page, it has dropped all the dynamic content and has to reload it, and then I have to scroll back to where I was (which may have involved several minutes of scrolling and loading content).<p>Perhaps it's irrational, but it also frustrates me that such pages have no bottom.  I think people got used to a model of a page where it has a top and a bottom, and now it's a bit weird to interact with. One of my favorite examples is Facebook's implementation, which leaves several useful navigation links in the page footer.  These links taunt you as you tried to scroll to reach them, only to have more news content appear in your view and push the footer off screen again. (I think they've since duplicated those footer links in other locations so you can reach them, but it doesn't change the fact that this broken UI model presents options and then sucks them away before you can click on them.)",1349243006

Worth noting that I work on security / spam fighting at Facebook, but these are solely my personal opinions.<p>""Social login buttons put security in someone elses hands""
You're damn right they do! I argue that in 99.9% of cases that's a great thing, for 3 reasons:<p>1. Facebook invests significant resources in both keeping bad guys out (we have been able to dramatically reduce large-scale phishing with a number of updates to our login security systems) and ensuring everyone else can get into their accounts easily. I can only speak for us, but I assume Twitter spends a lot of time on this as well.  I imagine it'd be tough for a startup to keep up with the 10-20 people we have working on this problem at any given time.<p>2. It's incredibly difficult to build a password system that is both easy to use and secure. There's an almost endless ever changing list to make sure you're hashing and salting properly, don't have SQL injection flaws, implement robust rate-limiting without allowing DoS, etc.  We've all seen many people screw it up in recent years. One of the largest benefits of Facebook Connect for startups is the ability to leverage our investment in these systems, without having to invest the significant time we have spent iterating on them.<p>3. We've spent a lot of time working on every aspect of login, so that startups don't have to. Your job is to build whatever technology differentiates you from your competitors, and make it worlds better than theirs. Any time you spend pfutzing with password hashing, building a better password recovery flow, or arguing about how to fail when people type in the wrong password is time you could better spend making a truly wonderful product. Unless you're trying to build a startup that helps people login, any time spent on this is better spent elsewhere.",1349241088

You can still drive on pretty much the entire length of the West Gate Freeway, right up to the tunnel portals without paying tolls. There are some short sections of motorway though that were previously un-tolled but are now tolled, though there has been some pretty extensive upgrades.<p>That said I'm no way in favour of City Link, but the real core 'arterial' for urban commuting is our public transport system. :-)",1349240553

No fucking code. Non-developers can actually get results with the system without having to resort to the kind of miserable hoop jumping we developers subject ourselves to in an attempt to make sure nobody else on the team fucks something up.<p>View got changed? Log in and change it back. Absolutely, positively MUST have an ongoing log of changes to your view/content type/custom field? All of these are exportable to code and can either be imported raw or live in modules.<p>I suspect you've worked with exportables at some point so I simply mention this for any spectators that aren't aware there are a number of strategies for getting your configuration into code (and thus revision control) if that's your thing.<p>Also, for the uninitiated, apendleton makes an excellent point about deploying config changes from dev/staging to production. It sucks, plain and simple.",1349240533

Hence the term misnomer :-) As an engineer I would be inclined to say ""if you find yourself in a survivable crash, the following things help increase your odds, ..."" which keeps the cool bits about back of the plane vs first class, exits vs non-exits, but side-steps the probability question of surviving a gross malfunction in a commercial jet.",1349240522

Maybe it'll end up costing 100B or not get done at all after spending 10B. Whenever anything costs more than like 1M, we get scope insensitivity and have no idea what we are paying for or what it's costing.",1349240486

Looking at the metronome video, I found myself thinking, ""There's got to be something deep there"".<p>It'd be really cool if the metronomes turned out to be a model of the quantum vacuum, and the patterns running though the array of oscillators turned out to be virtual particles winking into and out of existence.

4992272,comment,4991330,4992235,4,0,agentS,,,"Indeed JSON is not strongly typed. However, in practice, every API, every data exchange format I've ever seen or used has used JSON in a strongly typed fashion. i.e. they say ""the returned object will have a key of 'foo' with a number as the value, and a key of 'bar' with an array of strings as the value.<p>Why is this nicer?<p>Let's say you are working with the Reddit API. You can, of course, do it the way you suggested, and just decode the result into an untyped object. However, I find this incredibly brittle. You end up with strings indexing into arrays all over the place.<p>On the other hand, when you decode into a Go struct, you use the regular dot syntax to access parameters. You can't misspell these or use the value inappropriately (trying to loop over a JSON number, for example). You can write comments on the fields to document what you expect various values to hold. It is nicer in the same sense that using classes is nicer than just using arrays for everything.<p>Another benefit is of course the improvement of performance. Accessing an string value in a JSON object by a key is the equivalent of a hash table lookup in Python or PHP. It is incrementing a pointer by a constant number in Go (assuming you use strongly typed decoding).<p>I'll say it again, Go's encoding/json can do what you want (the equivalent of json_decode). There are better alternatives available to users of that package, and the GP was discussing how to exploit one of those better alternatives without having to write the struct by hand (which I personally find a trivial one time cost).",1357032646

Many of the most commonly raised ideas for amendments -- getting rid of the death penalty, legalizing gay marriage, abolishing the Second Amendment -- are deeply divisive issues among the people.  These factors make it very difficult for anyone to get the big majority necessary for a Constitutional amendment.<p>Changes in US party politics will ultimately be forced by demographics.  Minorities are increasing due to higher birth rates and immigration.  The baby boomers will eventually start dying.  Society as a whole is becoming more secular, especially among the young.<p>Either the Republican party will redefine itself in order to steal some categories of currently Democratic voters, a new party will rise to prominence, or (IMHO the most likely scenario) when the Republican party ceases to be a threat to Democrats' political agendas in ~10-40 years, the Democrats will themselves collapse.<p>The fault lines are already there:  Liberals like Obama favor massive spending on ambitious social programs.  Civil libertarians -- there seem to be quite a few here on HN -- want a reduced government presence and an expansion of individual rights.  Centrists like Bill Clinton aren't opposed to overseas military intervention and support balanced budgets and the reform of social programs.

Unlike code, you're only talking about symbols -- whose power lie solely in their ability to push emotional buttons in people.<p>Most of the less obvious and academic-y stuff is contained in the later parts of the article. Shooting portals that opens up to another part of the map is pretty obvious for anyone familiar with Freud. Less obvious is the broken AI that has a pseudo-maternal personality, the robots that speak in voices of little boys that can easily kill you, and the gigantic cube that you carry around. You only use that to flip switches, and you are encouraged by the AI to form an emotional attachment to it.<p>Seen in that way and having read the article all the way through, I agree with the author that most FPS force a male gender perspective on the player ... though I find that idea rather unsettling.",1197255566

The game will break your brain. <p>Second, you should listen to the final song.

87594,comment,87558,87584,0,0,Alex3917,,,"The problem with freedom is that most people aren't very good at optimizing their own happiness. At least when you're stuck in an institution there is some base level of engineered happiness as a by-product of that institution's need to fulfill its stated goals. Otherwise, freedom may start with travel and book-writing, but it has this habit of quickly devolving into sitting around reading Reddit and Slashdot. In other words, in their state of nature people have this tendency of doing just enough to make themselves minimally happy, even if greater happiness is ultimately attainable. Look how many people sit around all day playing World of Warcraft.<p>I guess what I'm saying is that even if you need freedom to achieve maximum happiness, complete freedom also leaves you with a much greater chance of getting stuck in some minimal existence. Which basically describes about a quarter the population of Japan.",1197255335

87591,comment,87522,87571,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Far be it from me to argue against higher ed -- I spent thirteen of the best years of my life in college, if you count the postdoctoral fellowship -- but if I were you I would take the job now and go to college later. There's plenty of time, and it's not like they stop letting you in to college because you're too old.<p>The thing about getting some work experience before you go to school is that it may make you a better student. You'll have a better idea of what you want to learn and why. You'll be better equipped to recruit future colleagues from among your fellow students, and you'll have better war stories to tell them when you're sitting at the bar.<p>The idea that ""a degree is a nice thing to fall back on"" is true, but the reverse is even more true: If your career falters, you can always go to college. (If you have the money, of course... but if you won't have the money then, you probably don't have the money now either!)",1197254375

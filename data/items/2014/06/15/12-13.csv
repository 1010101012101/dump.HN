7895130,comment,7894816,7895101,9,0,keithflower,,,"No.<p>Some conditions are overdiagnosed, and there is a too-cozy relationship between medicine and pharma that is disturbing to many of us.<p>However, to make a diagnosis based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) criteria almost without exception (one exception is for bipolar II disorder) require that symptoms (and several symptoms are required usually for any given disorder) must cause significant impact on one&#x27;s lives, eg,<p>&quot;...sufficiently severe to cause <i>marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization</i> to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features.&quot;<p>or<p>&quot;...symptoms cause <i>clinically significant distress or impairment</i> in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.&quot;<p>EDIT: (based on your own edit) - reserving diagnosis and treatment just to those at risk for self- or other-harm is going to harm many suffering people. I don&#x27;t think you understand what depression really is. It&#x27;s not caffeine withdrawal or the flu. Even when no suicidal ideation is present, it&#x27;s a serious disease with real costs to the individual and to society, just as real as cancer.<p>Beyond depression, I think you&#x27;d agree that even in the absence of harmful behavior or ideation, people who experience auditory hallucinations in the course of depression, or OCD sufferers who are unable to work because they must wash their hands hundreds of times a day, or who have PTSD triggered simply by backfiring engines, or who have dozens of other DSM diagnoses, all have legitimate illnesses that deserve much more than the terrible, stigmatizing suggestion that their illnesses somehow are not real.",1402837149

You won&#x27;t feel insignificant when looking at a cow because while bigger, it&#x27;s not that much bigger. Apart from poisoning you when you eat it, or kicking you by mistake, it has relatively little influence or impact on you, your life, your fate, or indeed, the fate of the human race.<p>Now, if you had a cow the size of the earth, that just sits there and eats cosmic grass, and could blow up earth and wipe out the human race with one of its farts, then suddenly the cow is rather more significant than it was before - if only because of its possible influence on you.<p>Finally, if the said cow is in fact not just an object but the very substrate that you exist in, and its so big that you can&#x27;t even begin to imagine how big it is, and it is filled with inhuman processes that could wipe humanity out at any moment from now to infinity, then a solid sense of insignificance seems perfectly warranted.",1402837143

That is, no matter how exhaustively a solution has been explored, if the implementation language is a dynamic one, then it is implemented in a dynamic language.<p>As an example, I take any of the MIX algorithms in Knuth&#x27;s books.  They are more thoroughly documented and explained than anything under other software I have ever seen.  They still aren&#x27;t statically typed.  (Simply put, if someone makes a mistake in transcribing it or &quot;cleaning&quot; it up, it will not be caught by a type checker.)<p>And, yes, I do think we ultimately agree.  The heart of my question is just wanting evidence.  I even agree with the premise that &quot;in the absence of other evidence*, I would have more faith in a statically typed solution than otherwise.

Ever wondered why Germany is so adamant about privacy? Because they remember what happened when a certain entity gained too much control. The thing is, it&#x27;s not a question if such mass control will be abused at some point. It&#x27;s just a question of when, maybe in 5 years, maybe in 15, but it will inevitably be abused at some point. Americans don&#x27;t get that, because they haven&#x27;t been there.",1402836189

With the way these disorders are currently defined I&#x27;m convinced that every human being on earth could be diagnosed at various points within their life.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that these symptoms don&#x27;t exist, but rather that they&#x27;ve been a perfectly normal part of human life since the dawn of man.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly natural for people to go through periods where they have less energy than other periods, overeat or under-eat, have difficulty concentrating or making decisions, feel anxious.  This is normal stuff depending on the life circumstances especially if you&#x27;re drinking any amount of coffee because that will lead to periods of highs and lows.  It does not mean you &quot;have depression&quot; as if there was some flu virus that you became infected with it simply means you&#x27;re a human being.<p>I would argue that legitimate diagnosis should be reserved for people who are either suicidal or who&#x27;s symptoms strongly suggest elements of self-harming or harming others.",1402836121

But, sorry, I am not going to read Techcrunch article about it.<p>Even publications that dedicated to following mental health (and ostensibly authored by &quot;experts&quot; in the field) tend to do a dubious job of describing what is an extremely complicated problem to which THERE IS NO QUICK FIX. Read that again. Addressing mental healthy problems is very hard work and treatment plans vary by individuals (not even by disease) so even once you find a doctor you like - no easy task - and whether you go into psychotherapy or the psychiatric [aka prescribed] route or both - you have a long, hard road ahead of you which will require a lot of patience from you and those that you maintain relationships with whether they are work or personal.<p>There are lots of mental health disorders of which depression is a common symptom. It&#x27;s important to work with a doctor you feel comfortable with to figure out if you suffer from depression, or if the root cause is some other disorder (OCD, bi-polar, anxiety are common amongst SDE types) which routinely causes you to feel depressed for days or weeks (or god forbid, months) at a time.<p>Even if you are comfortable going the medication route (and there are many reasons why this choice should not be made lightly, especially if it is via anti-depressants or another - they&#x27;re all habit forming and bring their own set of side-effects and problems), it is a long an arduous process to find the right one/right dosage/etc. that will work for you (if there even is one). Each one takes weeks to see results typically.<p>Anti-depressants help some people greatly. Others will struggle with them and find them counter-productive to their treatment. There is no one-size-fits-all treatment plan. Mental health is a subject that doesn&#x27;t get attention in any facet of American culture.<p>PS.

7895048,comment,7894825,7894825,5,0,uptown,,,"The American mainstream media is severely dysfunctional.  Cable &quot;news&quot; networks are biased outlets for each political party to deliver their message.  Even more-traditional network news outlets like NBC News have sacrificed the appearance of a separation of the reporters from the politicians they&#x27;re supposed to report on by hiring family members of recent and current political figures.  On NBC&#x27;s current payroll are Jenna Bush Hager, and Chelsea Clinton.  On CNN&#x27;s payroll is Chris Cuomo - brother to the Governor of New York.<p>It seems that above all else, mainstream news craves access.  Hiring the presidential daughters provides a network like NBC access to those presidential families in a way other networks may not have.  Attending the annual White House Correspondents dinner provides reporters access to celebrities and a night out of dining and drinking with the people they&#x27;re supposed to hold to account for their actions.  And being complicit with the military&#x27;s approach towards how a war should be reported ensures they retain their access to the war &quot;story&quot; - be it factual or massaged.<p>Recall the story from the NYTimes about the military analysts that networks always put on-air whenever a military story is being covered?  If not, it&#x27;s worth a read:  <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/us/20generals.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/us/20generals.html?pagewan...</a><p>Real reporting is hard.  And when media organizations elect to go along with how a story is presented rather than providing raw, unbiased accounts of things, it does an injustice to the public.  And it&#x27;s made even more difficult when an administration chooses to take an aggressive stance towards journalists regarding how they source and report their stories.<p>It&#x27;s never been easier to be a reporter and disseminate information to millions.  I can only hope that the public seizes that opportunity and fixes the ways that news is currently broken.",1402834194

It&#x27;s easy to blame a patient for unwillingness to participate, which can be the case, but doing so without an objective look at the reasons doesn&#x27;t fundamentally address the problem. There are many other conditions both physical and mental, that are personally and societally difficult to discuss openly, yet they aren&#x27;t plagued by similar levels of reluctance in patients. Why is that?<p>I would add more so much more, as I hope you can understand, and as the article alludes to, these aren&#x27;t issues easily discussed, especially not with relative strangers on the Internet and I&#x27;m not interested in hiding my opinions behind a throwaway. Suffice it to say that my own experiences have led to similar choices to the person you described, and whilst I&#x27;ve never experienced mania, I too believe myself to be better off for those choices. I can categorically say that the opinions shared by those closest to me, the effect on my creativity, productivity and my sense of &quot;self&quot;, corroborate that. In my case, the choice wasn&#x27;t to refuse all treatment or therapy, but only to refuse specific types of treatments which were drastically over-powered and negatively impacted me beyond any perceptible benefit. Subsequent consultations corroborated that decision, and criticised the treatment I was initially suggested as being so heavy handed, that it&#x27;s analogous to treating a cut finger with amputation of the entire arm.<p>One size does not fit all, and until approaches to treatment reflect that, we will keep repeating the same mistakes to the detriment of the afflicted. If you&#x27;re lucky enough to have a supportive network of family and friends around you, I can only reiterate the article&#x27;s salient point: &quot;talk about it&quot; and add the suggestion that you educate yourself to the best of your ability, to help making the best possible decision.",1402834077

4013969,comment,4013292,4013292,11,0,taliesinb,,,"I've been using Go for a performance-critical part of a production system and I've been thoroughly enjoying it. But certain things have been odd and frustrating.<p>One trait that I find frustrating is how pedantic Go is about types.<p>For example, if I have a float <i>x</i> and an int <i>y</i>, I can't write <i>x / y</i>, I have to write <i>x / float64(y)</i>. The intent is to force awareness of type conversions that introduce subtle gotchas, but I don't see how it applies to the case <i>float / int</i>.<p>A better example of the same phenomenon is that alias-style types need to be explicitly cast to their aliased types, which introduces pointless noise into what would otherwise be a nice way of 'marking up' the semantic role of variables and arguments (think <i>type index uint</i>).<p><i>Notice there is a common-or-garden 'int' but no common-or-garden 'float', apparently because one should always be aware of precision. Unfortunately, because of the alias type issue I mention above, 'type float float64' doesn't help.</i>",1337792392

[1] The production gun is expected to us 64 Megajoules. The challenge is that you have to impart all the energy you can before the projectile leaves the gun (because you then lose your source of acceleration) and drag (or air resistance) is proportional to the <i>cube</i> of the velocity. So the faster you try to make something go, the harder the air resists it moving.<p>Using the math from ""Rocket Propulsion Elements"" [2] it seems like for anything other than a needle shaped projectile it would not be practical.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.navytimes.com/news/2008/01/navy_railgun_test_080129w/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.navytimes.com/news/2008/01/navy_railgun_test_0801...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Propulsion-Elements-George-Sutton/dp/0470080248/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1337792234&sr=1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Propulsion-Elements-George-Sutt...</a> Pretty much everything there is to know about rockets that isn't classified.",1337792368

4013955,story,,,5,3,eragnew,"Ask HN: Are we drawing the right conclusions from the Facebook IPO?",,"All of this Facebook talk is really starting to irritate me. Everyone is doing IPO postmortems, but I still think they havent grasped the real point. Here are my take-aways from the IPO:<p>	This is not 1999. Stop worrying that it is.\n	We created the hype around Facebook. Facebook as a company really had nothing to do with what just happened. They were just along for the ride, like the rest of us.\n	If you dont think Facebook is worth $100 billion, <b>then dont buy Facebook shares</b>. No one is forcing you to.\n	The IPO process is incredibly broken and incredibly inefficient, still favors Wall Street insiders to the disadvantage of retail investors, and is simply not transparent. But given the interconnectedness of todays world, all of this will change soon. The IPO process as we know it will be fundamentally reborn in the new future, and it will become much more fair. Otherwise, no one will want a part of it.<p>Dont believe me? Lets take a look at some of the postmortem analysis from the past few days:\n(NOTE: Some of these articles make good points. Im only pointing out the things I disagreed with)<p>Gawker  The Facebook IPO Was an Inside Job\nhttp://gawker.com/5912419/the-facebook-ipo-was-an-inside-joke\n(accessed on 5/23/12)<p>Facebook's stock continues to suck harder than a Northwestern University freshman on a 5-foot bong in his profile pic.\nYour snarky opener is really contributing to the conversation.<p>It turns out that the insiders who did the Facebook deal withheld some important information that showed it wasn't such a good deal after all. Analysts at three of the major underwriters, including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, significantly reduced their forecasts for Facebook's revenues just before the IPO, according to Reuters. They did not widely publicize this information via, say, a Facebook status update. They quietly shared it with their buddies at hedge funds and other big investment firms, many of whom cut back on their investments accordingly. Meanwhile, the general public continued to froth at ever-climbing valuations.\nYes, this is something that the bank analysts and Wall Street syndicate partners appear to have done. And it angers people, rightly so.<p>""Facebook was whispering in the ears of the lead managers of its investment banks, on the understanding that the results of those whispers would remain available only to select clients until after the IPO was over,"" writes Reuters' Felix Salmon. This doesn't seem to be illegal, just shady as hell.\nIs Felix really saying this is true? That Facebook actively and intentionally whispered material, non-public information into the ears of the Wall Street analysts? If so, thats pretty damning. But Ive read Felix for a while and I dont think he would make a claim like this without having the facts. Well go to the source in a minute.<p>So, Mark Zuckerberg screwed Facebook investors in the IPO like he's screwed Facebook users on privacy. (Hours before the IPO, Facebook was hit with a $15 billion lawsuit over privacy violations.) This would be just a hilarious coincidence, except for the vast amounts of money he's made doing both.\nI see that this is the conclusion youve drawn. I disagree. I think youre making assumptions that arent correct and need to reexamine your thinking. But Im sure you got some pageviews because of your conclusions. Thats your job, after all: to get pageviews. Not to be right.<p>Felix Salmon, Reuters  The Facebook earnings-forecast scandal\nhttp://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/05/22/the-facebook-earnings-forecast-scandal/\n(accessed on 5/23/12)<p>As Henry Blodget says, this whole episode stinks. Its almost certainly not illegal. But if you look at the Finra rules about such things, it definitely violates the spirit of the law. For instance, the rules say that Morgan Stanley analysts werent allowed to show Facebook their research before it was published  but they dont say that Facebook cant quietly whisper in Morgan Stanleys ear that its estimates might be a bit aggressive.\nI think most people would agree that this whole episode stinks. But lets make sure we come up with the right conclusions about why this stinks.<p>What [retail investors] didnt know  what they couldnt know, because nobody told them  was that those estimates had been cut, significantly, just days before the IPO.\nNo argument here.<p>Its true that retail investors werent buying Facebook stock on the strength of the banks earnings estimates, since they didnt (and still dont) know what those earnings estimates are. But heres a material nonpublic fact about Facebook, which retail investors and everybody else in the deal deserved to know: all three underwriters cut their estimates simultaneously, in response to some very minor changes in the revised IPO prospectus.\nAgain, no argument here.<p>Heres Blodget:\nSpeaking as a former analyst, it seems highly unlikely to me that the vague language in the final IPO amendment would prompt all three underwriter analysts to immediately cut estimates without some sort of nod and wink from someone who knew how Facebooks second quarter was progressing.\nAha! So Blodget thinks that Facebook had to have leaked information, or at least given some sort of nod or wink, because Because thats what he thinks. If there were some evidence to support this, please bring it to the public. Bring it to the SEC so they can investigate. But youre telling me Facebook should be implicated in all this because Blodget thinks so? Give me a break. Blodget is a true pillar of integrity and ethical behavior</sarcasm>.<p>This does not mean, of course, that Facebook stock is doomed for all eternity: it could pull an Amazon, and rise sharply out of its post-IPO slump. But this does mean that shareholders should not expect much in the way of transparency or full honesty from a company which is controlled by Mark Zuckerberg personally and which has deliberately created a dual-class share structure in order to to ensure that they can be completely ignored on all decisions. <b>Facebook was whispering in the ears of the lead managers of its investment banks, on the understanding that the results of those whispers would remain available only to select clients until after the IPO was over.</b> Thats not cool. And as a result the company definitely deserves the latest lurch downwards in its (still frothy) share price.\nJump to conclusions much, Felix? I expected much more from you.<p>Maybe Im wrong. Maybe someone at Facebook did leak some information to the Wall Street analysts. Maybe everyone is right to be mad at Facebook.<p>But I have a different view. I think what this fiasco really shows is that the interconnectedness of todays internet makes it impossible for Wall Street to operate in the shady, opaque manner that is has for decades. The free ride is over. No one will tolerate this horrible inefficiency that benefits Wall Street insiders to the detriment of everyone else anymore.<p>This should lead to the democratization of finance. A level playing field. Retail investors are becoming smarter, and Wall Street insiders can no longer pray on the ignorance their ignorance. Which makes me think that Wall Street banks are overvalued. Maybe I should short JP Morgan and Goldman instead of Facebook.<p>In fact, all of this negativity surrounding Facebook is making me think that now might just be the perfect time to buy Facebook shares. If Facebook can finally learn the lesson that its experienced users hate ads, maybe they can focus on creating value for their users instead. If Facebook does figure that out, watch out. A $100 billion valuation would be incredibly undervaluing the company.<p>Anyway, thats my take. I may be wrong. But if I am, Im certainly willing to admit it.<p>Emmett\ntwitter.com/eragnew",1337792266

4013859,comment,4013142,4013804,10,0,nknight,,,"You speak of ""going public"" as if it's somehow turning over power to the general public. It's not. It's a colloquial term for a series of regulatory steps required to permit non-accredited investors to invest in a business. These steps are primarily designed not to exercise control over the operations of the company or its ownership and power structures, but to ensure a certain level of disclosure to investors whose resources and influence are limited.<p>There is nothing about going public that implies a general relinquishment of control of the company, nor is there anything about going public that mandates a particular ownership or power structure. Companies have ""gone public"" by selling only a few percent of their stock. Split voting rights are very common. None of this is even remotely illegal or unethical so long as it is disclosed, as it has been here.<p>If you do not like a company's control structure, you do not have to invest in it, whether the company is ""public"" or ""private"". As a shareholder, your relationship to the company is the same whether it's public or private.",1337791240

4013850,comment,4010297,4012496,2,0,robomartin,,,"If don't have to back-up anything.  If you are interested you go and do the research, it's actually very easy these days.  Also, I worked within a unionized environment for eight years.  I have seen the beast from the inside.  What it does to people and businesses is nothing less than horrible.  I have seen people come to work drunk knowing full-well that they could not be fired for it.  I have seen people sleeping at work.  Again, can't fire them.  I have seen people refuse to help out where help was needed because it was not in their union contract (""Can you help me move this (light) box?  No.  It's not in my contract"").  I've seen people get paid $150K per year to do what most anyone would consider nothing or very little.  Jobs that in the ""outside"" free market would not justify more than $15 per hour suddenly become $50 per hour + benefits + pension for life jobs in an unionized environment.<p>When you look at the fact that government is loaded with unionized workers one of the most immediate reactions should be:  As tax-payers we are getting shafted.  These people are getting paid lots more than their free market equivalents. Lots. And, of course, when you count lifetime pensions funded by taxpayers the numbers are far worst.<p>OK, since you are an evidence kind of guy (or gal, I don't know) I'll take the time to give you some of that data.  Let's use this link:<p><a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm</a><p>Oh, wait a minute, that's the link YOU provided. Yup.  Thanks.  I reviewed the page and came up with these interesting notes:<p>""In 2011, among full-time wage and salary workers, union members had median usual weekly earnings of $938, while those who were not union members had median weekly earnings of $729.""<p>Translation: If you do the math, median union worker wages are about 29% higher than equivalent free market workers.<p>I'll leave it to the reader to Google a little and find data comparing wage differentials by occupation.<p>Here's another one:\n""In 2011, 7.6 million employees in the public sector belonged to a union, compared with 7.2 million union workers in the private sector.""<p>Sounds fairly benign, right?  Until you read the next two sentences:<p>""The union membership rate for public-sector workers (37.0 percent) was substantially higher than the rate for private-sector workers (6.9 percent). Within the public sector, local government workers had the highest union membership rate, 43.2 percent.""<p>So, on average 37% of government workers are unionized.  And, if you look locally, over 43% belong to a union.<p>Only 7% of free-market workers are unionized!<p>Something stinks here.  Government workers figured-out how to game the system by unionizing.  We now work for them.<p>This is where the huge conflict of interest is created.  Government workers belong to unions in staggering numbers and they vote and act as a block.  They also enlist the support of other unions in getting behind legislation and politicians who will keep throwing candy at them.  Again, all you have to do is look at California and the disaster that politicians and unions have created to understand how badly this can degenerate.<p>There's plenty of evidence of this on the web:<p><a href=""http://news.stanford.edu/news/2011/december/california-pension-debt-121411.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.stanford.edu/news/2011/december/california-pensi...</a><p><a href=""http://www.ocregister.com/articles/pension-336894-california-public.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ocregister.com/articles/pension-336894-california...</a><p><a href=""http://www.pensiontsunami.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pensiontsunami.com/</a><p>A quote from one of these links:<p>""a research team based at Stanford University and headed by Joe Nation, a former Democratic state assemblyman, released an updated analysis of state and local pension funds, concluding that they are underfunded by hundreds of billions of dollars and, unless reformed, will seriously erode future financing of schools, health care and other services.""<p>Anyhow, you can believe what you'd like.  You can believe that corporations are evil.  And that's fine.  That will not change reality.  Even when corporations cover everything form the corner bakery to Apple.  And, BTW, nobody ever claims that Apple is evil.  It's those other evil corporations.  Also, nobody ever seems to state at what revenue level corporations become evil.  Or after what number of employees?  By any measure Apple should be one of the most evil corporations in the world.  The reality that remains unchanged is that we and our children are very likely to have to pay for union pensions for the rest of our lives.  And, that, among other things, is horribly wrong.<p>While I could be more ignorant than I have a clue (as someone in this thread kindly pointed out) the sad reality is that even this does not alter the facts.  If it did I'd gladly declare myself to be an utter idiot.  The facts are that unions are causing and will continue to cause a lot of damage at many levels.  Here in California we ought to seriously look at the idea of, at the very least, removing them from government.",1337791139

Modern pesticides are extremely toxic in small quantities, some with immediate and easily observed effects, others with delayed and long-lasting effects.<p>Regulatory limits are often based on immediate observable effects. Delayed hard-to-observe problems tend to be ignored. See the toxicity of organophosphates and COPIND, and the history of its regulation (when regulations were enforced; when the upper limit was revised to consider the problems of COPIND). There are research results that suggest some Americans have a sufficiently high dietary intake of pesticides to affect their lives.<p>Furthermore, for many pesticides, there's no way for the policy makers and public to estimate its toxicity, because research is often suppressed, dissemination of toxicity information is often suppressed, policy change is often suppressed, etc. It's a well-established problem with the political-economy of America.<p>In many less-developed-countries, MNCs like Monsanto and Bayer have used aggressive and deceptive sales techniques and misrepresentation of product toxicity to persuade farmers to use pesticides far in excess (over 100 times the level of) of regulatory limits in the US. These products do get exported. Search for such news and policy discussions in India and China.<p>Lastly, pesticides don't ""often"" break down into chemicals similar, in biological activity, to estrogen. Pesticides can cause quick death, physical deformities in fetuses and young children, autism, epilepsy, mental retardation, cancer, organ failure, rashes, ulcers, can be used in biological warfare, etc. Some pesticides take decades to breakdown; Some pesticides have metabolites that are extremely toxic.

9000579,comment,8996498,8996498,0,0,Cyranix,,,"I&#x27;m not seeing a lot of comments describing first-hand experience with a holacratic system, so I&#x27;ll jump in.<p>I was a developer at Moveline (which shuttered, sadly, this past December). Around the start of 2014, the company adopted holacracy as its organizational model; while there were certainly other valid reasons to do so, but I know that it was in part motivated by the fact that another Las Vegas-based company, Zappos, was also an adherent. Over the course of the year, in addition to writing code, I also served as the elected secretary for the dev team and facilitator of the GCC (General Company Circle; top-most level of the hierarchy), attended holacracy training courses, and coached people throughout the company about the mechanics of holacracy and how to make it work for them. Suffice it to say, I was pretty immersed, so I feel like I can represent how things played out at Moveline fairly accurately.<p>The up-front costs associated with shifting from a traditional structure to any other structure can be pretty massive; holacracy is no exception to that rule. Bigwigs from the official holacracy company (HolacracyOne) came onsite to give talks and run the first several meetings, which cost a decent chunk of change as well as taking time out of a busy startup&#x27;s day. Teams and roles needed to be defined using the terminology and mechanics of holacracy. There were impacts here and there to scheduling, to communication systems, and to getting things done in general. Eventually, however, the ramp-up phase ended and we were able to experience holacracy in full.<p>As you might expect, there were established figures in the company who felt strong resistance to holacracy. Some of them held significant managerial power before the transition; others wanted a flatter, less formal approach. Those tensions came up fairly frequently in meetings and other conversations, and it created an atmosphere of not being quite satisfied with how things were being run (not that these people should have stifled their opinions, mind you). This problem was compounded when we entered a major growth phase, going from under 40 employees to over 100 in the span of a few months. New hires were unfamiliar with holacracy, necessitating additional training, but just as importantly they entered an environment where low-grade dissatisfaction with holacracy was palpable. If there&#x27;s a lesson here, it&#x27;s that adopting holacracy requires far more buy-in than you might expect. (For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m not aware that anyone ever felt unable to voice their dissatisfaction at Moveline; we had a culture of open and honest talk, but identifying an issue isn&#x27;t the same as solving it.)<p>A natural question to ask at this point is &quot;What about backing out of holacracy?&quot;, to which I&#x27;d reply that it&#x27;s easier said than done. Since a not-insignificant amount of effort goes into the initial setup, it&#x27;s easy to fall prey to the sunk cost fallacy. The rationalization is reinforced by HolacracyOne, who clearly stated to us that most companies won&#x27;t <i>really</i> be fully operational as holacratic organizations for at least six months. Actually, the tenets of holacracy itself reinforce the idea that you just have to keep pushing forward no matter how weird it may feel: the first setup step effectively tears down a bunch of preconceptions about corporate structure, and you won&#x27;t really feel like you&#x27;ve gotten to the point where you can critique holacracy until you rebuild that structure.<p>The flexibility you get for achieving the new structure is touted as a feature, but the less marketable truth is that it&#x27;s a double-edged sword. Holacracy is purposefully vague on where the authority for hiring, firing, and budgets will live. Lead Links aren&#x27;t managers, but they are accountable for resource allocation that isn&#x27;t defined elsewhere — and it&#x27;s up to your company to figure out what limits are placed, who places the limits and how, what constitutes a &quot;resource&quot;, and so forth. It&#x27;s entirely possible for an employee to have zero roles — and it&#x27;s up to your company to figure out whether that has any correlation to terminating employment, changing teams, hiring needs, and so forth. Furthermore, self-defining teams present an unfortunate opportunity for organizational thrashing; at Moveline, we saw major revisions to the structure around meta-org work (HR, facilities, finance, etc.) and our sales/support teams every few months. Those upheavals, while well-intentioned, degraded individual performance, disrupted internal communication, and fed back into the underlying dissatisfaction.<p>I haven&#x27;t read The Tyranny of Structurelessness cited in many other comments, but from the title alone I am assuming that it&#x27;s an accurate depiction.<p>That said, there is one thing that I feel like holacracy helped with significantly: the emphasis on well-defined decision-making. When teams stopped saying &quot;<i>We</i> will get this done&quot; and started routing tasks to specific individuals (who had an obligation to perform those tasks according to the roles they held), it was clear that the reduced ambiguity had a positive impact. The use of &quot;we&quot; has its place in an organization, of course, but &quot;we&quot; is just a code word for &quot;not sure who&quot; when it comes to planning specific, concrete work that needs to get done. If you&#x27;re not careful, things can get a bit political when it comes to defining authority (at Moveline, this often related to holacratic &quot;domains&quot;), but I&#x27;d still consider the technique of specific task attribution as something I&#x27;d want to bring to future workplaces.<p>I&#x27;m happy to answer any other questions about my views on holacracy that HNers might have.",1423090353

If your structure can have either 9 or 10, but not 9.001, supports, it is discrete, not continuous, regardless of failure mode. And remove one of the 3 legs of your stool, and you probably wouldn&#x27;t have 2/3rds of its support remaining, but whether you did or didn&#x27;t would be an issue of proportionality, not continuity.<p>There are a lot of jumbled concepts here, most of which don&#x27;t matter anyway, because what you are talking about is the phenomenon of <i>graceful degradation</i>.

Having everything on consoles with such rich instrumentation simply isn&#x27;t workable, you have to focus on what&#x27;s the most useful. At some point you&#x27;re going to end up in the code, and from there see what metrics (and logs) that code exposes, ad-hoc graph them and debug from there.<p>> Lots of lines on a single graphs helps you notice imbalances you may not have noticed before. For example if a small subset of your cluster has lower CPU usage then you likely have a load balancing problem or something else weird going on.<p>Agreed, scatterplots are also pretty useful when analysing that sort of issue. Is it that the servers are efficient, or are they getting less load? A qps vs cpu scatterplot will tell you. To find such imbalances in the first place, taking a normalized standard deviation across all of your servers is handy - which is the sort of thing Prometheus is good at.<p>> You have to shard that subsystem further by something random and arbitrary.<p>One approach would be to have multiple prometheus servers with the same list of targets, and configured to do a consistent partition between them. You&#x27;d then need to do an extra aggregation step and get the data from the &quot;slave&quot; prometheus servers up to a &quot;master&quot; prometheus via federation. This is only likely to be a problem when you hit thousands of a single type of server, so the extra complexity tends to be manageable all things considered.",1423089942

If you want kids to be involved with the process of creating new food sources, have them start creating new food sources. Then they&#x27;ll have a context for understanding how cells work and the value of organic chemistry and the other basic and advanced biology concepts. If you present it as just another boring thing that they&#x27;re being forced a learn, a lot of creative and curious minds will shut down and just go through the motions of homework assignments and studying for quizzes. Many of us on hn are programmers not because we were forced to learn programming in school, but because we wanted to make a thing and set about learning the skills necessary to make that thing. That&#x27;s what this article is saying, learn by doing.<p>The second issue is that not everyone can or should become a biologist. One of the other commenters mentioned that his son wanted to be an air traffic controller. Why make him sit through a biology class at all? It&#x27;s possible that he&#x27;ll be so intrigued by life sciences that he&#x27;ll change his mind and switch his career path. Certainly wouldn&#x27;t be the first 16 year old to do that. But our method now is to force young people to sit through dozens of hours of instruction on topics that they will probably never recall or use again in order for a small percentage of them to go on to advanced study. There has to be a better way. What we&#x27;re doing now isn&#x27;t just a waste of time and resources, it&#x27;s actively turning kids against the process of education in general.<p>We need to allocate resources to hiring better teachers and to standardizing education across states and school districts.

Our current education system fails miserably at this. The one thing we don&#x27;t need is more of the same.

Only primitive types can be array elements. So you get array of references to objects instead of array of objects.<p>There are only 512 L1D cache lines in a CPU core. After just 512 references to memory areas covered by different cache lines, L1D entries will start to drop. Or earlier. In Java this happens very easily. Like when just iterating a single, not very large, data structure.<p>Everything else (except maybe SIMD/GPU related items for compute purposes) are not anywhere near as important as fixing Java&#x27;s current problems with CPU caches.",1423089617

9000452,comment,8997844,8999710,0,0,jkire,,,"> How does Matrix deal with netsplits and partial-netsplits?<p>> How are highly diverged histories (e.g. a long netsplit in an active room) supposed to be merged?<p>So the cool thing with the federation in matrix is that all the messages (and state changes like room memberships) are part of a directed acyclic graph (DAG), so any new messages that are sent reference the previous ones. (Very much like git). That way a server can tell if it is missing any messages as long as it can talk to <i>a</i> server in the room. Since everything is signed by the originating servers, servers can pull in missing messages from third parties! Thus partial-netsplits are fine, as all the messages will eventually propagate through to all servers :)<p>When a full netsplit happens you effectively get two separate branches in the graph, each group of servers happily talking to each other. When a netsplit is resolved, one of the servers will realise they can talk to one of the other servers, at which point one of the them will send an event that references both branches (in effect merging them). All the other servers will then realise what they are missing and pull the branches in. At that point a certain amount of state resolution needs to happen (e.g. if people joined and left on the different branches) to ensure that all the servers have a consistent view of the state of the room.<p>The really difficult problem we&#x27;ve found is how you communicate to the clients about the netsplits, and how the clients should display the netsplits (although this is more of a UX issue, but still important). Since the messages in the room are stored as a DAG, the servers can see what messages were part of which netsplit and so that information can be made available to the clients.<p>> Does the protocol require O(N^2) connections for N users? (The number of users in some IRC rooms is measured in thousands.) Can it be more efficient?<p>Currently the protocol uses full mesh to distribute the messages to all the servers (which in practice are going to be fewer than the number of users in the channel), though since it uses HTTP the servers don&#x27;t need to maintain active connections to all other servers. We really want to come up with new distribution models for really large rooms at some point, but we haven&#x27;t quite gotten that far yet :)<p>> How are rooms administered?<p>The user that created the room gets admin rights to the room and given a &quot;power level&quot;. The admin can set the power level required to do different things, (e.g. kick, ban, set the name of the room etc), as well as whether you need an invite to join the room or not. They can also grant (and revoke) power levels to other members of the room.\nNow, if a remote server intentionally ignores these rules then other servers in the room will simply not accept the dodgy actions. All actions, whether message sending or banning someone requires the server be able to <i>prove</i> that they had permission to do that by supplying a list of events along the lines: &quot;I can ban because I have power level X, which was assigned by Y, who could do that because...&quot;.<p>(I&#x27;m part of the matrix team ftr.)",1423089063

How exactly do you think we&#x27;ve gone about making the scientific advancements in food production that have allowed us to feed 7+ billion people? It involved teaching a bunch of kids basic biology, then teaching them advanced biology in college, then teaching them gene splicing techniques as well as research skills in graduate school, then having them chip away at how to get more productive, hardier crops at a research lab.

9000328,comment,8996498,8996498,0,0,lisa_henderson,,,"As Jo Freeman once said:<p>&quot;Contrary to what we would like to believe, there is no such thing as a structureless group. Any group of people of whatever nature that comes together for any length of time for any purpose will inevitably structure itself in some fashion. The structure may be flexible; it may vary over time; it may evenly or unevenly distribute tasks, power and resources over the members of the group. But it will be formed regardless of the abilities, personalities, or intentions of the people involved. The very fact that we are individuals, with different talents, predispositions, and backgrounds makes this inevitable. Only if we refused to relate or interact on any basis whatsoever could we approximate structurelessness -- and that is not the nature of a human group.\nThis means that to strive for a structureless group is as useful, and as deceptive, as to aim at an &quot;objective&quot; news story, &quot;value-free&quot; social science, or a &quot;free&quot; economy. A &quot;laissez faire&quot; group is about as realistic as a &quot;laissez faire&quot; society; the idea becomes a smokescreen for the strong or the lucky to establish unquestioned hegemony over others. This hegemony can be so easily established because the idea of &quot;structurelessness&quot; does not prevent the formation of informal structures, only formal ones. Similarly &quot;laissez faire&quot; philosophy did not prevent the economically powerful from establishing control over wages, prices, and distribution of goods; it only prevented the government from doing so. Thus structurelessness becomes a way of masking power, and within the women&#x27;s movement is usually most strongly advocated by those who are the most powerful (whether they are conscious of their power or not). As long as the structure of the group is informal, the rules of how decisions are made are known only to a few and awareness of power is limited to those who know the rules. Those who do not know the rules and are not chosen for initiation must remain in confusion, or suffer from paranoid delusions that something is happening of which they are not quite aware.&quot;<p>Her comments were aimed at the feminist movement of the 1970s, but her essay is universal and everyone can gain from reading it:<p>The Tyranny Of Structurelessness<p><a href=""http://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm</a>",1423087864

9000268,comment,8999644,9000089,0,0,trcollinson,,,"The most I can say is, it depends. Federal sentencing guidelines are interesting for a few reasons.<p>First, there is a formula which, quite literally, is a mathematical formula telling the judge a federal minimum and a federal maximum range of times for a crime. This is based on a number of data points surrounding the laws broken.<p>Second, each law has rules about its own sentencing guidelines baked in. Let&#x27;s look at the specifics for Conspiracy for a Criminal Enterprise: 20 year minimum for first conviction, 30 year minimum for second conviction, a life sentence for a &quot;extremely large enterprise&quot;. There are tables and figures for figuring out what all of this means for minimum to maximum and so on. I am not going to attempt to say I understand how this particular Federal judge will try to figure it out.<p>Third, in general sentences of multiple convictions on the same trial are supposed to be run concurrently. However, this can be changed if a court decides otherwise, for various reasons. Additionally it can be changed if a specific law states that it should not be run concurrently, but instead consecutively. The judge must actively consider whether to impose a concurrent or a consecutive sentence accounting to the US Code (18 US Code 3553 (a) [1]). Again I do not want to speak for a Federal judge but, I could easily see a judge interpreting these rules in this case to justify a consecutive instead of concurrent sentence.<p>I agree with you 100% that Mr. Ulbricht will likely not see the maximum consecutive sentence in this case. However, there are no hard and fast rules in Federal sentencing, they are guidelines. It could be decades, it could be quite a bit more.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3553#a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3553#a</a>",1423087274

9000266,comment,8997353,9000175,0,0,x0x0,,,"a cache line is the unit of read from ram, and is at a premium<p>At least for data, a common win is to compress the data in ram and decompress once it is in-core; this is often essentially free as many machine learning algorithms are bandwidth starved but have plenty of compute available.  Suppose you are eg storing small integer counts in ints; if it&#x27;s a java int you are using 4B to store 1B, while if it&#x27;s a java.lang.Integer it costs 16 bytes <i>plus</i> most likely an 8B pointer.<p>Another way to consider this is if you are using 8B pointers, you waste a lot of that as constant zeros -- 1TB is 2^40, so even on a 1TB machine 3B/24b are wasted.  Particularly with (all?  at least that I know of) jvms that have 8B alignment, another 4 bits are wasted.  This is how the CompressedOops hack words to access 32G ram w/ 32b pointers.",1423087256

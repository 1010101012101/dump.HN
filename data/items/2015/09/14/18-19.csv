The only reason for that bundling is because the economics of print require it. But the economics of online publishing are completely different. So why take it as written that &quot;issues&quot; have to be a thing?<p>For that matter, why do <i>articles</i> have to be a thing? If we&#x27;re really trying to get back to first principles, maybe the idea of corralling facts into a narrative structure that&#x27;s a certain number of words long should be challenged, too. Maybe content is best delivered online like a stock ticker instead, brief bursts of new material completely unmoored from each other, with the reader left to tie them together however she wants to.<p>(Hey, we just invented Twitter!)<p>I don&#x27;t want to bag on TFA too much, it was written in 2012 and it&#x27;s easy to take predictions from a few years back and poke holes in them with the information we have that the predictor didn&#x27;t. But it does feel like it&#x27;s part of a broader problem in publishing, which is people <i>thinking</i> they&#x27;re making bold decisions and burning the bridges that connect them to the past, when in fact they&#x27;re still carting around tons of legacy baggage that they don&#x27;t <i>realize</i> is legacy baggage because they&#x27;ve lived with it for so long they just take it to be part of the environment.

I don’t post much but I’ve found a great deal of comfort and motivation just reading what others go through when trying to start a business (which we all know is damn hard!).<p>So today I wanted to say thanks and share something which will hopefully make you smile, feel motivated and inspired as you go through the journey of building your own business.<p>As a founder of 2 startups - one slightly successful, one not successful at all - I’ve had a lot of ups and downs…sometimes felt downright miserable. We all get in a funk sometimes, and I found one of the things that helped me, aside from lurking on this sub, was to go read a bunch of inspirational/motivational quotes. Might sound cheesy, but it really helped get me into the right frame of mind each day.<p>So as a side project, my friend and I set up a little text-based service that we’re calling “Happi”. Instead of you having to search for inspirational/motivational quotes, we simply send you an SMS each morning to help you get in the right frame of mind and give you a good start to the day.<p>We just made it so it’s still in beta and US only. If it’s helpful to people we’ll probably roll it out to more countries.<p>So there it is, if you need a little cheer in your day, feel free to check it out and let us know what you think!<p>http://happi.lol/super-secret-page",1442257041

10216427,comment,10216129,10216315,0,0,jusben1369,,,"The challenge for the developer is twofold; 1) Understanding the real time availability of the inventory at the retail partner and 2) Supporting the payment provider of the retailer. In the desktop world this was solved by a straight up affiliate redirect. You arrived at the retailer page and saw your product in a shopping cart or close to it. Of course if inventory was poorly synced you occasionally got an error. This is still pretty common with things like airline metasearch services where the cheap ticket can be gone. Either way inventory was managed. Then you entered your payment method on the retailer site and it was processed by their backend processor.<p>In the mobile world with mobile optimized apps those redirects don&#x27;t work. So app developers want to make the payment experience feel like it&#x27;s happening &quot;within the app&quot; Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and others all then had to solve for the inventory + payments challenge. Defaulting to Stripe can be problematic if the retailer already has a different payment processor relationship in place. By solving for the inventory piece I suspect Stripe is hoping to help drive momentum around overcoming the processor objections.<p>Full disclosure I work at Spreedly where we help solve for the payment dilemma (not inventory) by allowing developers to work with a wide range of payment processors and/or affiliate API&#x27;s.",1442253705

But anyone trying to create a unique image just has so many more options to adjust with a DSLR (and even more options than that if you shoot with film).<p>Unless you&#x27;re a professional or doing &quot;art&quot; photography, these days you really don&#x27;t need much more than a cameraphone. And even then, a 5-year-old midrange DSLR with a few lenses is more than enough gear. But the images from a phone just don&#x27;t look as rich, or have as much dynamic range thanks to the small sensor. They can do some neat tricks to approximate an SLR 80% of the time, but for the other 20% you still need a real camera.",1442253635

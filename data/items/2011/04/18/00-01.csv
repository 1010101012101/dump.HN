These bonds are not tradeable on any market and do not represent an actual financial asset, the way a Treasury bond does.  They are literally pieces of paper in a cabinet in West Virginia.  They are truly IOUs on a sticky pad.  There are no assets behind them, and there isn't even a legal obligation for the government to repay them or anyone ""contributing"" to SS.  (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flemming_v._Nestor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flemming_v._Nestor</a>)<p>The interest payments in the budget are actual repayments to Treasury bond holders, but NOT interest payments on SS obligation bonds.

Can we please stop pretending otherwise?<p>And, though it's something of an appeal to authority, I do think it's relevant in this particular case - keep in mind when google interview people, they themselves actually seem to think this stuff you're down-playing is important. I doubt an appeal to 'well I'll learn algorithms and so on later once I've got stuff working' would really prove sufficient.",1303085445

If not, why doesn't jQuery just automatically prevent navigation for links when handling the click event? Then for the few cases (confirming navigation, perhaps tracking user actions?) the programmer could explicitly indicate the continue through with navigation.<p>Having to write preventDefault() in each handler seems like unnecessary noise, doesn't it?",1303085019

I have to be a little less picky about exact styles, but I always end up with nice shirts.<p>I tried customizing a couple shirts on Blank Label. The cheapest I was able to get was $50, and that was essentially a standard shirt, nothing I couldn't get at any store, and I don't know how it will look or fit.<p>When I started playing with it and having fun, I quickly ran the shirt up to $92 - and could have easily sent it far higher.<p>It's a wonderfully well-designed web site, and fun to use, but hard for me to see the value in buying shirts there.<p>Best of luck to the Blank Label guys, I just thought I'd give my ""why I didn't buy"" feedback, since they seem to be here on HN.",1303084835

1076492,comment,1075440,1075440,0,0,jsz0,,,"Realistically Flash isn't going to just disappear. I think everyone understands that. We just want an alternative whenever possible. I can certainly understand that Flash game creators don't want to re-write their perfectly functional games in Objective-C. The Adobe Flash iPhone complier solves that problem nicely. For anything on the web, ads, videos, navigation, etc I don't think it's unreasonable to expect a Flash free alternative. Adobe's embarrassing Flash support on OSX/Linux is a perfect example of why we need alternatives. Adobe apparently cannot even adequately support three major operating systems. How can we rely on one company to provide make or break support for an entire assortment of computing devices? Three major operating systems (at minimum) each with 32bit/64bit variants and multiple browsers in mainstream usage. Half a dozen mobile phone platforms too. To date Adobe has been able to offer good Flash support for a grand total of <i>one</i> operating system. If there weren't real fundamental problems with the security, stability and performance of Flash I don't think we'd be having this conversation at all.",1264460343

1076487,comment,1076273,1076273,0,0,geuis,,,"We have several raw stylesheets that are full of documentation in the form of css comments. We run these through CSSTidy before concating them all into one file. CSSTidy, while a few years old, does a reasonable job of cleaning out a lot of the cruft that we need internally but don't want to deliver to the end user.<p>You should <i>not</i> be doing any kind of minification or cleanup on your css & js during the page request. These need to be done during your build process and cached on a CDN, or at least as a static file somewhere.<p><i>Edit</i>
As a further note, here's a short list of things to do <i>before</i> deploying css, images, and javascript live.<p>css/javascript/images should be considered static. Unless you're running a specialized application, these are resources that require no modification from one page request to the next. css & javascript are text files. Images are binary formats.<p>1) Minify css & javascript. If you have multiple stylesheets internally on your dev environment that you use for purposes of keeping code separated, but all the code ends up being used on all your pages, combine them together into 1 file. The same thing for javascript files.
2) Compress images. There are a number image compression techniques. Most of these are accessory applications that are run during deployment. They take your original images and create optimized versions that are smaller but same dimensions. The images are then stored elsewhere and don't affect the originals.<p>3) Images come in 2 varieties: Style and content. When and where possible, images used for Style should be turned into background sprites. Multiple images in one file can be moved around with css to achieve different affects. Content images tend to be more dynamic (imagine a news site with lots of new pictures each day). These images should be optimized but can't easily be sprited the same way background images can.<p>4) Serve static content (ie css/js/style images) from a server that does NOT pass cookies. Cookies are extra bandwidth that you don't need to transfer for things like this. So say you have www.mysite.com. Serve your static resources from a non-cookie subdomain like static.mysite.com.<p>5) Use multiple subdomains to serve static resources. Modern browsers allow something like 6 simultaneous connections to the same domain on average. So if you have a lot of stuff on your page (like a news or photo site), you can get a big performance boost by loading your static stuff from static1.mysite.com, static2.mysite.com, static3.mysite.com, etc. The technique I have used to good effect is a 'round robin'. During my build process, I do a search and replace on my default path variable {csspath} in my stylesheets. I rotate the replacement through each sub-domain. As the browser is loading the content of the page, its doing many more simultaneous requests. Each sub-domain is loading from the same place.",1264460205

1076483,comment,1076188,1076188,0,0,gkoberger,,,"Having worked at a company that made both Kindle and printed books, here's something to think about- if someone can make a Kindle book for $9.99 (and this seems low, even for a book, let alone a text book), they can make a printed book for $19.99.<p>The problem isn't that books are printed on paper- paper is cheap.<p>If teachers contributed to and utilized wikibooks.org (or similar services), we could have free textbooks (or, low cost, if you choose to buy/print them- and, there are services that will let you print wikimedia wikis).",1264460069
1076482,comment,1076188,1076188,0,0,shrughes,,,"The price is not that important.  In a wealthy western nation, $100 for a textbook is quite reasonable, if you're spending any amount of time reading it.  Compare that to the price of a lecture.<p>Ebooks mainly give incremental improvements.  The one big improvement is searchability.  I suppose search on Google books now suffices.<p>Even if we count that, the benefit of e-books is marginal.  Getting incremental patches is nice in certain fields -- those that change a lot over a decade.  The patching of errata is generally useful though.  Having comments on textbooks would be, well, I don't know if that would be useful.  That sort of thing tends to produce a lot of pedantic comments or other comments on stuff the reader shouldn't be distracted by.  Consider the comments on the PHP documentation.  So much of it is wrong.  It's the sort of thing that would require moderation, so I suppose reader->author communication would be the path.  But what author wants to spend time on that?<p>Also, it's better for communities to develop around a piece of subject matter than a particular ebook sold in a particular format -- these can include different textbooks at the same time, can include people who get dead-tree textbooks, and can include discussion that extends beyond what textbooks talk about.  It doesn't really make sense for a textbook to come with a forum attached.<p>I think the trouble with all these ideas is that they all worsen the signal-to-noise ratio.  The nicest part about e-book textbooks is the low price and open market.  Looking back at my past, it seems the biggest inefficiency in my learning was in deciding what to learn, not how I learned it.  I think that problem should be what we want to tackle the most (and $9.99 might help quite a bit there, since people can then get a cheap taste of the material).",1264460017
1076481,comment,1075255,1076287,0,0,mbrubeck,,,"Suppose I'm a tenured professor and I publish a blog with educational posts about computer science.  I write blog entries during my working hours.  The blog isn't a requirement of my job but it may help raise my academic profile.  Am I free to use your CC-BY-SA 3.0 photo to illustrate my blog post?<p>What if, instead of a professor, I am a freelance programmer.  There are no ads or other exchange of money directly related to the blog, but sometimes potential clients find me through my blog.  But the blog is also a way for me to converse with a group of regular readers whom I already know.  Is this blog <i>primarily</i> directed toward commercial advantage?<p>In either of the above scenarious, suppose the blog has ads but that I don't turn a profit on it (i.e. the ads defray but do not cover the hosting cost).  How about now?<p>Or what if the revenue from the ads is more than the hosting cost, but much less than I could make through my professional activities.  If the amount of money is tiny relative to the time I spend on the blog, could I argue that the blog is not <i>primarily</i> directed toward commercial advantage?<p>You may find each of these cases perfectly clear and obvious, but wherever <i>you</i> draw an ""obvious"" line, the above study probably shows that many Creative Commons members will think it should be somewhere else.  Even the organization that drafted the license admits that it doesn't provide very explicit guidance for common cases like web sites that include (but don't rely on) advertising, or sites that do not involve exchange of money but may provide less-tangible commercial advantages for their owners.",1264460015

But even then, it often simply meant those who hadn't were relegated to a lower echelon of respect.<p>So there's your status element for Halo's difficulty modes.<p>Now, getting back to the author's points on Easy Mode, I'll show why his overall argument (though perhaps quite appropriate for many other games) doesn't hold water with Halo 3, which should make the truth of his claim situational at best.<p>Rather than the author's example of the game developers adding an Easy Mode where there was none in previous installments, Halo 1 and 2 already had Easy Modes, so one obviously can't complain about its inclusion in Halo 3. (Well, to be fair, many have complained that EACH of the difficulty levels was made easier for Halo 3, but I've yet to see objective, rather than anecdotal, evidence for this claim. But even that isn't quite the same as adding an Easy Mode where none had existed before.)<p>No, rather than that, Legendary was made objectively easier to beat, thus devaluing its achievement and therefore its worth as a status symbol. Let me explain:<p>Legendary is of course at least as difficult-- and, the vast majority of the time, far MORE difficult-- than each of the other difficulty modes. (Duh, right? That's what a difficulty mode is.) The enemies had smarter AI, they were tougher (e.g., even a sticky bomb, an auto-kill on any other difficulty mode and in online multiplayer, couldn't kill most classes of Elites; you had to inflict even more damage than that), and there were way more of them.<p>In Halo 1 and Halo 2, if you played co-op campaign on any of the lower three difficulty modes and you died but your teammate stayed alive, you could just respawn back into action. If you were playing alone though, you'd respawn at the last checkpoint you passed. This is why most of the lesser-skilled players completed their campaigns playing co-op: it was WAY easier; there was no real penalty for dying. But here's the catch: the game developers wouldn't let you do that for Legendary. If you played co-op and either player died, you both respawned at the last checkpoint rather than respawning back into action immediately. Thus, completing the campaign on Heroic garnered little respect (but certainly not disrespect, necessarily), because nobody knew whether you achieved it ""legitimately"" (i.e., on single player, where you couldn't exploit the lack of penalty for dying) or not. Legendary, however, could ONLY be completed legitimately. It meant something concrete.<p>Except on Halo 3.<p>For the third game, the developers decided to allow players the same exploit in Legendary that had only previously existed in Easy, Normal, and Heroic-- thus robbing Legendary of its significance as an achievement. After all, the metrics for how good you are at the game in general are a) kills and b) lack of deaths. Remove the latter from the equation, and Legendary becomes...well, no longer legendary.<p>Prescribe whatever reasons you wish for this decision by the developers, but I'm willing to bet you'll face an uphill battle if your reasons are the same as the author's in his Mega Man X Easy Mode hypothetical.",1264458355

It takes a lot of work in QA to figure out why this is useful (back me up on t his one, experienced QA engineers) and the right way to do it so I'll give you the Cliff Notes:
This sort of bitmap recognition lets you automate that ""last mile"" QA groups can never seem to automate. autohotkeys, selenium, and other things all help automate lots of aspects of the interface with tons of caveats and gotchas. This is a much more useful, if less pleasingly elegant, solution.
When you are automating testing it's relatively easy to automate back-endstuff, write unit tests, write scripts wrapping cli interfaces and so on, but every automation team that deals with GUIs eventually stubs their toe on automating the user interface. BY having the computer automate the GUI task in the same way a human user executes it ( ""I want to click the Apple Menu - Where is the Apple icon I know is on top of the Apple Menu? - Ah! There it is! I'll click it"" ) you make it easier, or even possible, for the people writing the qa automation to automate the GUI in a reasonable amount of time.
There are some pitfalls. What if someone changes the theme on the automation rig? Well, you're an engineering team, not a preschool - DON'T change the theme!
What if somebody changes an icon in the app you're testing? Fortunately you have access to the bitmap (it's saved with the rst of the build files, yeah?) and of course the change notes for the build  tell you hte iocon has been updated. Well, of course it isn't in the change notes, but when a test that was working fails you can easily run to the point where it says ""Can't find the foo button."" This is a hint to look for the foo button and think about why it can't be found.
Finally, all good scripting languages have an escape hatch to call otehr programs that can do things better than they can and return a result. Need to check an old COM object through its native interface? Write a small Windows app that your script calls to get that state.
It takes a lot of experience and frustration with trying to fully automate tests on a GUI to understand why this is useful. and the cry of ""Bitmaps break because things cahnge"" - well, no they don't. Not on a computer . Not if you know what you're doing and have control of the source. (Please disable all auto-update systems on your test rig or you will be surprised at some point.)",1264458207

Perhaps, God of War developers could have increased the damage output of the enemies or increased the frequency of their attacks instead of increasing their resilience.<p>However, I agree that I prefer when they add smarter AI rather than just increasing the enemies damage output or increasing the amount of damage they can sustain. In a game like God of War, the depth of the AI in general may be small to begin with, and there may not be much they can do to improve it.

You've hit upon the tragic core of this industry: Namely, that it's full of semimature people who are only well-known because they're well-known. This is such a new field of study that even the biggest figures are usually only halfgood at what they do.<p>That's cruel. Let me rephrase: This isn't a new field. It's a <i>series</i> of new fields, all developing in tandem. Web design, web coding, web marketing, are all necessarily only a couple of decades old. The tools we're using are younger than that. Two years ago we were still debating how to align a webpage vertically. We've only begun to have real web typography in the same period of time. And programming is similarly new, and we still don't have good web marketing. But those of us who're invested in the web don't like to think about that, so we convince ourselves that we're as advanced and sophisticated as anything else. To do that, we lower the bar.<p>Celebrities in any field tend to balance skill and marketability. Rarely is somebody both ultrafamous and cutting-edge. So in a world where nobody is really that famous and nobody is really that talented, our famous icons are doubly pathetic. Even our best icons, like Zeldman and Fried, are bright but not really operating on a new plane. (I think there are some exceptions, like Dean Allen, but Dean isn't the size of Calcanis.)<p>That's why the brightest talents in our sphere come from other mediums. I think the best designers I know are all twee and twenty and annoying as fuck. For all their immaturity, that's the first generation that could grow up immersed in all the aspects of the business. But admitting their superiority is admitting just how fucking clueless we all are, and that wouldn't be as fun for the communty.<p>Calcanis is a particular jerk, though.

Number two, there is no guarantee that new articles from those sources will necessarily do well. The more refined way to do this is to train a recommendation engine from an article aggregation system on some of the top articles that have been most liked on HN. Then, as the engine will collect and rank articles for you automatically and you can just use your script to take the article from the recommendation site and post them to HN. This way you have more assurance that your submissions will be liked on HN, and also the engine will likely find new article sources that you have never heard of before. I friend of mine is using this method to become a power user on Digg and Reddit. I think the uses several sites and has coded his own ranking system but the bulk of his recommendations come from www.euraeka.com, which is a news aggregator and recommendation engine. Basically he signs up for an account, finds out what the top articles on Digg are for lets say last year, then picks the top 25, searches them in Euraeka and then the engine starts finding articles that are like those. All he does afterwards is submit the recommendations on Digg. I think he does the same for Reddit.
Anyways, Euraeka is just one of the engines out there. I am sure you can find others as well. The only question is which engine is spitting out the ""best"" recommendations.

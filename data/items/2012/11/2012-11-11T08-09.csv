But using a hosts file or DNS block, it was much more opaque about why it was failing as you'd have to remember something you'd forgotten about: You've blocked this thing at the DNS level, it wouldn't resolve. Or more to the point, it would resolve to a local web server that served up zero bytes.<p>That's my worry with a black box on the line... how easy is it to override in those edge cases, and will they play safe by sticking just to known banner adverts and not tracking sites which are sometimes necessary parts of functionality (due to the fact that links are redirected via the tracking site).",1352624232

4769099,comment,4767789,4767922,2,0,Jach,,,"> Time to start a 'developers' company that works very much on the same model that Sun Microsystems started on, hardware designed from the ground up to be developed on, open systems so that folks can easily work with it, and a team dedicated to making sure integration and support is there so that folks like you and I can say ""Hey this audio doesn't work when you set the sampling rate to 40Khz"" and they can fix it and release that fix.<p>Um. Any company that does that is probably going to go out of business, just like Sun. You know who's a ""developer's"" company? Microsoft. And if you drink their kool-aid, your Visual Studio-developed desktop apps will run smoothly across all sorts of hardware with a single compiled exe. Microsoft convincingly showed that hardware doesn't matter many years ago, in fact their focus on software over hardware is arguably why they won, and they treat their licensed software devs well regardless of what company they work for. There are many instances of ""Hey Microsoft, this doesn't work"" and Microsoft responding with a custom piece of software to fix the problem. Some developers are angry about Windows 8 because they perceive that Microsoft is caring about them less, and that's probably true, but Microsoft will learn again that it shouldn't upset its developers if it wants to retain its supremacy.",1352624195

Was $30,000 a reasonable salary? $60,000? I realized then that everyone's aversion to talking about money had left me in the dark as to how the business world worked.<p>Writer inexplicably <i>still</i> can't think of a reason for secrecy about money and salary.<p>The reason is obvious -- keeping you in the dark pays off. The employer benefits from your ignorance. Other people in your approximate position, but who have the job you seek, benefit from your ignorance. Everyone benefits from your ignorance except you.<p>All I can say is, wait until you actually have some money and/or a salary. Then you'll understand.<p>> Why is everyone so hesitant to share their salaries and other financial information?<p>Because information has intrinsic value, and particular kinds of information have high intrinsic value. How many times have you read about a settlement between businesses in which the terms were sealed by a court order? Can you think of a reason why?",1352623222

Perhaps you question their methods, which is legitimate, but if you have any other information apart from that, I would like to hear it.<p>Additionally, I don't know if I can criticise their model. Yes, it's not very innovative, but on the other hand you can think of it as a outsourced European development team for US-based startups. They know the market, the language(s), the problems. They do the development work and then if the original startup wants to buy the product, they can. Who knows, perhaps it might even end up being not much more expensive than setting up the infrastructure and acquiring the knowledge required to operate in the EU. It might also serve as a test case: ""is service X really going to work in the EU?"". They take the risk that something might not work.<p>As an EU-based developer (who never used any of their products. yet?), I also think it's valuable for us (EU-based developers). Instead of waiting for startup X to get their act together, they offer us an alternative, which then later might be merged with the original product.<p>As a side note, there is a bit of a unintentional Schadenfreude to be found in this article as well. Since it's 6 - 7 months old, their investments in Facebook, Zynga and Groupon doesn't look so hot anymore as it did back then. Maybe they should avoid the investment side of things.<p>Edit: grammar",1352623056

The current text was posted there on purpose but it's something we know we have to change if we want to get a lot of users.<p>I will be be working on testing what works and what doesn't :)",1352620994

Exactly how many depends on how you count them - are pld and pldw different instructions? mov and movw? uadd16 and sadd16? vadd.i16 and vadd.i8? vadd.f32 <Dd>, <Dn>, <Dm> and vadd.f32 <Sd>, <Sn>, <Sm>?<p>Conservatively (relative to x86 where I'd imagine everyone counts pavgb and pavgw as separate instructions), ARM has well over 300 instructions. Include significantly different permutations of instructions, and you're easily over 500, and probably outnumbers x86.<p>Even if you discount vector and floating point, ARM still has around a hundred distinct instructions.",1352620801

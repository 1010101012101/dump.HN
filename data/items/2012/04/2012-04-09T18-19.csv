But the truth is, we have great jobs for a lot of people.<p>Want to work on awesome visualizations for gigabytes and terabytes of data daily? We got it. Want to work on building a development platform for an extremely powerful data analysis tool? We got it. Want to help make the core server that powers our extremely fast indexing and performance better? We got it.<p>For example, my project for the past couple of months has been to develop our new Node.js/Browser SDK, including pulling some of our propietary UI components and sharing them with the world. We also do a lot of work with customers to best help them use Splunk. One of the projects I was involved in included analyzing social data using Splunk (like Twitter/Foursquare).<p>Whether it's UI, core systems engineering, dev platform or anything in between, we likely have something for you. I personally work on the development platform in the Seattle office, but I'm happy to answer questions about anything. Feel free to shoot me an email (in my profile), or comment here.<p>I wanted to highlight a few specific positions we're looking for:<p>* Dev. Platform Software Engineer: This is the team I work on. We strongly believe that there is a use for Splunk outside of logging, and we're enabling the usage of the technology for dealing with large quantities of data, whether it's for social network analysis, cloud management or anything in between. <a href=""http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-</a>
CAAAGK3?jvi=oHkCVfwi<p>* Cloud Software Engineer: we're developing the next stage of our product, which is a hosted version of Splunk in the cloud, with all the benefits you'd expect (like automatic elastic scaling). Come help us make this a reality: <a href=""http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGK3?jvi=o4U8VfwL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGK3?jvi=o4U8VfwL</a><p>* Hadoop Software Engineer: Usage of Hadoop is exploding to do batch-oriented processing on massive quantities of data. We think there is a lot of value to be had by combining the power of Splunk and Hadoop, and we're developing solutions to make this possible. <a href=""http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGK3?jvi=oqCaWfwS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGK3?jvi=oqCaWfwS</a><p>* Software Engineer in Test: Splunk is a complex machine, deployed in a distributed manner, many times being used for different things. Our testing team is top notch, and helps us deliver quality releases. <a href=""http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGK3?jvi=o5ZvVfwe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGK3?jvi=o5ZvVfwe</a><p>* Windows QA Engineer: Splunk is putting a lot of effort into making Splunk & Windows to be a match made in heaven.

The sustaining team is in charge of making sure that after major releases, we can keep customers happy for a long time. <a href=""http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGK3?jvi=obAdWfwE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGK3?jvi=obAdWfwE</a>",1333997970

2) ""to a fairly large audience"" is your personal assumption. Not all people use social media that way.
3) Photo of a sunset? That sounds like your being obtuse. Obviously many photos are much more personal than a sunset.
4) To be seen ""by the wrong person""? Again, seems obtuse to me. The larger concern is the photo being permanently stored by the wrong corporation(s), to the eternal detriment of user privacy.
5) You are assuming that the user him/herself posts all photos of a given user. That is obviously not the case. Your photos, or photos picturing you, can be posted by others as well.<p>Suffice it to say, many users who do enjoy social media nevertheless do not want Facebook using everything they post for the next 25 years for marketing purposes. They don't want that content sold to other corporations, either. And there are many other possible legitimate privacy concerns.",1333997819

3818591,comment,3818112,3818461,8,0,pault,,,"This is the point that the haters are missing. We're using a heavily modified bootstrap with backbone, and it has dramatically decreased our turnaround for new UI features.  Other than the button styles, you can't really tell it's there.  To me, bootstrap is CSS boilerplate that is clever and thoroughly tested, so you know when you copy a component or a design pattern from it, chances are it will Just Work.  Creating customer-facing sites from 100% vanilla bootstrap isn't ideal unless you are building an MVP or some administration panel where a custom design wouldn't necessarily improve the user experience.  It also really raises the lowest common denominator for teams that can't afford a lot of design work. I think bootstrap has been a great boon to web UI in general, and I am looking forward to seeing it evolve and inspire other frameworks in the future.",1333997651

3818568,comment,3817850,3818178,3,0,psb217,,,"It's not necessarily that Instagram would become a viable competing alternative to Facebook on its own. Rather, it seems reasonable to imagine that Facebook would be concerned about the widespread adoption of third-party, cross-platform social infrastructure, as provided by Instagram.<p>Instagram, in providing a photo sharing experience (at least) on par with Facebook's, spanning multiple ""social platforms"", facilitates user migration across these platforms. In the current context, any user migration between social platforms would (almost) inevitably dilute Facebook's share of user-time.<p>Thus, it seems reasonable for Facebook to acquire this possible avenue of departure and generally maintain its current state while guiding future evolution of Instagram's product to subtly guide the flow of users along ""Instagram Avenue"" towards Facebook, rather than in its current unbiased direction.<p>Though useful from a business perspective, this sort of defensive acquisition is discouraging to me. I would prefer to see the evolution of ""social"" in general towards an open protocol for maintaining the actual user<->user graph structure and piping of information along it, with a loose confederation of services such as Instagram providing the content hosting/delivery. This would decentralize control of people's social graphs, with control being restricted to subsets of the shared content and its flow over the graph, rather than the actual graph structure itself. I.e. market-driven services such as Instagram would compete to control portions of the infrastructure implementing this new construction, which one might call the ""world wide (social) web"".<p>TLDR: Facebook's purchase of Instagram permits them to simultaneously reduce the instantaneous rate of user migration across social platforms while preventing the emergence of a competitive open social platform/protocol, the evolution of which would be greatly facilitated by the prior existence of third-party social content infrastructure such as Instagram, which reduces the size of the ""chicken and egg"" problem confronting any attempt at an open platform.",1333997419

Which most likely means the people that made the decision did not have the best interests of the company in mind.<p>It is not that complicated. Let's say there is X amount of economic benefit from the deal. Initially (i.e. before the series B) that benefit would be shared between Facebook and the initial (i.e., before the series B) shareholders of instagram. Facebook would get the benefit of owning the company minus the purchase price and the investors would get the purchase price.<p>But after the series B there is another party, the new Instagram shareholders which must also share in that benefit. This means that either Facebook or the initial shareholders or both get less benefit than they would have gotten if the series B had not happened.<p>So who got less benefit? Well in these cases one just has to ask oneself who is likely to make a decision against their own benefit. And when you look at people making decisions against their own benefit it usually the ones with the longest and remotest chain of fiduciary duties that do it.<p>So I guessed that it was facebook that might have done it because it has much more and more remote shareholders, so it is more likely someone may have slipped up on their fiduciary duties.<p>But I do not know for sure. It could have been the instagram owners or old shareholders that got screwed. In any event, it is quite certain that one or both of them did get screwed.",1333997310

In the current context, any user migration between social platforms would (almost) inevitably dilute Facebook's share of user-time.<p>Thus, it seems reasonable for Facebook to acquire this possible avenue of departure and generally maintain its current state (i.e. Zuckerberg's statement is honest) while guiding future evolution of Instagram's product to subtly guide the flow of users along ""Instagram Avenue"" towards Facebook, rather than in its current unbiased direction (i.e. Zuckerberg's statement is disingenuous).<p>Though useful from a business perspective, this sort of defensive acquisition is discouraging to me. I would prefer to see the evolution of ""social"" in general towards an open protocol for maintaining the actual user<->user graph structure and piping of information along it, with a loose confederation of services such as Instagram providing the content hosting/delivery. This would decentralize control of people's social graphs, with control being restricted to subsets of the shared content and its flow over the graph, rather than the actual graph structure itself. I.e. market-driven services such as Instagram would compete to control portions of the infrastructure implementing this new construction, which one might call the ""world wide (social) web"".<p>TLDR: Facebook's purchase of Instagram permits them to simultaneously reduce the instantaneous rate of user migration across social platforms while preventing the emergence of a competitive open social platform/protocol, the evolution of which would be greatly facilitated by the prior existence of third-party social content infrastructure such as Instagram, which reduce the size of the ""chicken and egg"" problem confronting any attempt at an open platform.",1333996869

Big pharma is ignoring it since it can't be patented (because it's so common).<p><i>Cancer cells change the way they metabolize oxygen in a way that promotes their survival. In laboratory studies of isolated cancer cells grown in tissue culture, DCA restores the original metabolism, and promotes their self-destruction. This has led to the use of DCA for treating cancer, by individuals experimenting with it themselves, by doctors administering it to patients as a non-approved drug, by scientists testing it in cancer tissue cultures in cell culture and in mice, and in human Phase II studies. DCA has improved certain biochemical parameters, but it has not demonstrated improved survival.<p>Cancer cells generally express increased glycolysis, because they rely on anaerobic respiration that occurs in the cytosol (lactic acid fermentation) rather than oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria for energy (the Warburg effect), as a result of hypoxia that exists in tumors and malfunctioning mitochondria. [9] [10] Usually dangerously damaged cells kill themselves via apoptosis, a mechanism of self-destruction that involves mitochondria, but this mechanism fails in cancer cells.
A phase I study published in January 2007 by researchers at the University of Alberta, who had tested DCA on human[11] cancer cells grown in mice, found that DCA restored mitochondrial function, thus restoring apoptosis, allowing cancer cells to self-destruct and shrink the tumor.[12]
These results received extensive media attention, beginning with an article in New Scientist titled ""Cheap, safe drug kills most cancers"".[11] Subsequently, the American Cancer Society and other medical organizations have received a large volume of public interest and questions regarding DCA.[13] Clinical trials in humans with cancer have not been conducted in the USA and are not yet final in Canada, emphasizing the need for caution in interpreting the preliminary results.[13][14]</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichloroacetic_acid"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichloroacetic_acid</a>",1333996610

3818496,comment,3816385,3816385,5,0,jroesch,,,"I was once one of the people who was incorrectly told, and therefore believed simple tasks like IO in Haskell was hard.
Though it couldn't be further from the truth.<p><pre><code>    main = do handle <- openFile ""filename.txt"" ReadMode
              contents <- hGetContents h
              putStr contents</code></pre>
Now that simple bit opens a file, reads its entire contents, and prints it to stdout.<p>Look at something similar in Java:<p><pre><code>   FileReader file = new FileReader(""filename.txt"") 
   //Then I have to choose how to read the file in, how to
   //buffer it, ect.
   String contents = file.read(...)
   //...

It looks copy+pasted from a million other sites, but without anyone with a good eye to look it over and pull the disparate copied elements together. For all the negative feedback, there should be more acknowledgment that Kyro's decision does a far better job aesthetically and in terms of polish than what exists now.<p>Second, when did marketing and design become conflated? Most of the criticism is about the approach the designer has taken to writing marketing copy and otherwise persuading people to sign up. Is that really the role of a designer? Maybe it is these days, but I think that means the role has now become a hybrid of two pretty unrelated disciplines.<p>A great designer takes a sense of experience and branding and <i>translates</i> it into abstraction: color, form, rhythm, etc. Kyro has done a good job of this. The design, text aside, reads as high-end, serious, appealing to professionals, and most importantly like a solid company that is trustworthy and can deliver on its promises.<p>A great copywriter or marketer is doing a totally different thing, trying to persuade people and get them to convert. From knowing some people who are pretty good at both things, I'm not convinced that these two roles should be turned into one. I think this is a vast improvement on <i>design</i> before I even analyze whether or not its a <i>marketing copy</i> improvement.",1333996383

It is a degenerative state of the same system that produces healthy cells and fertile humans.<p>It is genetically very diverse. Part of this is because cancers cells often have mesed up chromosomal replication which produces more variability. Part of this may be because numerous genetic variations can have similar effects because they effect the same gene or network of genes.<p>As the author alludes to at the end of the paper, there are a number of things a tumor must do to be successful. These include avoiding the immune system, avoiding programed cell death, recruiting blood vessels/nutrients etc. There has been lots of really promising research in the last few years that looks at analyzing and targeting the pathways that control these things.<p>Further as projects like the the Cancer Genome Atlas (which I work on as a Software Engineer) produce terabytes of data about cancer, we are able to apply modern data analysis to better understand the system, hopefully discovering what separates the biochemical state of an aggressive cancer from one the body handles without issue which will hopefully lead to some novel drug targets.",1333996144

Millions of people around the world love the Instagram app and the brand associated with it, and our goal is to help spread this app and brand to even more people.<p>Facebook has always integrated whatever it purchased (that I know of) very tightly into the core product, or just done an acqui-hire. Instead, they've taken what is arguably the best way to share photos and decided to keep it as a product that exists on its own.<p>This is a major strategy change for Facebook and speaks to something I have suspected for some time - they now understand that in order to continue spurring growth, they cannot just acquire and roll in every product. As the ecosystem starts to hit a long-term maturity cycle, other products that fulfill particular functions better will be key to maintaining dominance over the market as a whole.<p>Let's face it: G+ cannot topple Facebook (though it probably wasn't intended to anyway), Twitter is fairly specialized and Pinterest has come up with a new way to share that fits neatly with the other two. Instagram makes immense logic as a purchase for Facebook as they'll control one of the most important ways people share photos outside their product, neatly roping everyone that uses it right into the FB circle without feeling forced to do so.",1333995093

The rise of ""free"" simply represents a new dynamic in the market for artistic works. To be fair, it <i>is</i> a dynamic that places downward pressure on prices, and that's not necessarily great for most artists. But it's a dynamic that the market has created and is absorbing, and so artists must come to terms with it.<p>As an artist, you now have to think very carefully about how to price your work. If you believe your work is of exceptional quality, then by all means, price above the market. Likewise, if you believe your work appeals very specifically to a segment that's willing to pay X price, then go with X price and target that niche. If, on the other hand, your work is fairly generic, of average quality, or generally nothing special to any special groups of people, then making a living as an artist is going to be tough for you. Your choices are to price it to market (which may be $0), or differentiate substantially (enough to bear a nonzero price).<p>Practically speaking, moral arguments on either side are somewhat irrelevant. Instead, what matters is the artist's positioning relative to everyone else. Today, more than ever, you'll have to make yourself special -- or specialized -- if you want to earn a decent living.",1333994966

They can't just ""re-invest it"" into other companies.<p>Unless those economics have changed, but I don't think they have.<p>It is in that light why I say, it seems a bit precarious. Essentially what would have happened is, these VCs would have contacted their limited partners and said, we have an investment we want to make - send us the money now (this is after the limited partners already committed to giving them that money). The LPs then wire the VC fund the money. The VCs then wire that money to Instagram.<p>3 months later, Instagram wires the money (assuming it was all cash, which we know it wasn't) back to those investors, which then have to wire the money back to their LPs. So technically, it doesn't REALLY help their portfolio as much as if they got a 10X return in a few years because the money was put to work for a shorter period of time.<p>Although, if you are 'annualizing' the return properly and assuming a 33% return each month, then the yearly return is actually 29X (compounded), but we digress.",1333994781

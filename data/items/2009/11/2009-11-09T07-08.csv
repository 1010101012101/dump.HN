930576,comment,930496,930496,0,0,mahmud,,,"Capinski and Kopp's Measure, Integral and Probability is a good brisk introduction to the theory as well, albeit a bit hand-wavy at times.<p>If you're feeling brave, have a shot at Wheeden and Zygmund's ""Measure and Integral"" :-)<p>Zygmund does not do prerequisites, he assumes you know as much as he, so you will need to do a lot of heavy lifting on your own and augment his works with other resources. I accidentally bought ""Trignometric Series"" from Amazon for $100 once, and when it arrived, I couldn't read anything past the preface. It sat there on my desk for months; I was messing with signal processing at the time, so I was reading a lot of materials and going back to it every once in a while. I kept opening it up and forcing myself, out of guilt. Over time, this much loathed text became my best friend; whenever ""intro"" texts became too chatty, I turned to Zygmund to get the gist of a theorem or a technique. I started comparing proofs and eventually came to prefer it. Still, was overkill for someone who isn't an specialist.<p>[Edit:<p>I really don't recommend the book in the parent post. It feels a bit antique; I have had by first brush against analysis via Knopp's cheap Dover books. Excellent mathematics, yes, but the excessive syntax, weird conventions and unpronounceable German alphabet made it harder than it needs to be. I recommend people get set-theoretic intros to analysis; mathematics teaching has become far more accessible in the last few decades, and nowadays the yellow Springer-Verlag texts, specially for undergraduates, is doing a fine job combining rigor with readability. Serge Lang pretty much made mathematics playful.<p>After that, move to the hard-cover Princeton Series on Applied Mathematics, and reach to the blue Cambridge books for absolute rigor, and the company of masters.]",1257753352

930571,comment,930402,930552,0,0,patio11,,,"You may be thinking of the discussion here.  <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=926506"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=926506</a><p>The presentation it references for support of the ""1% is the limit"" myth is here: <a href=""http://particletree.com/features/web-app-autopsy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://particletree.com/features/web-app-autopsy/</a>  ""Myth"" is strong language for me, but I believe it is justified in this case.  If you play ""Hey I got a BA degree for a reason, let's play secondary researcher"", it is based off of a misstatement of a repetition of a claim that doesn't even appear in the primary research.  All the primary research says is ""Three particular firms we have convenient access to say they have about 1% visitor -> purchase conversions.  That's probably typical, then.""  (Even the primary source skips over the fact that one of the three actually reported 1.14%, which is a 14% difference that falls straight to the bottom line, and the other two reported to exactly one significant digit.)<p>You'll note that visitor -> purchase is very different than trial -> purchase, but don't beat yourself up, different folks routinely quote both numbers at 1%.  It should be self evidently obvious that both groups cannot possibly be equally right, but as it turns out they're probably both just equally wrong.<p>In addition to being incorrectly repeated from a misreported summary of anecdotal data, the claim is empirically false.  I can't tell you other people's numbers, but I can tell you mine: 2.45% trial to purchase conversion.  Feel free to do much better than that -- it is certainly possible.  (Important possible apples-to-oranges alert: my freemium app is not sold on a subscription basis.)<p>This post is not meant as a personal attack: I have heard this statistic, and its older brother (""1% of shareware downloads convert"") for years.  Vaporizing it in the harsh light of actual evidence is one of my numerous personal crusades, because it leads to poor decisions that actually cost people money, like ""Well, conversion is a fixed number so I totally can't add 5% to my bottom line by working on buttons or something absolutely stupid with a shopping cart redesign.""",1257752891

On my Android phone, the right navigation wraps, because there's no room for it otherwise.  On the much bigger screen of my Archos 5 media player (Android also), it displays fine -- it looks like it does on my desktop.<p>Turn the text size down, and things are fine on both.<p>Also, what does Twidroid Pro not do that anything on the iPhone does?  I can post photoblog entries to Twitter and Posterous right from the home screen and I can go into the app to see messages from people I follow.

930553,comment,930230,930230,0,0,_dan,,,"This is a really good set of guidelines. Here are the three most effective things you need to do (in my experience) to get and maintain decent delivery rates:<p>Remove your bounces. I cannot stress this enough. If you're sending using a homebrew system or a script on a webserver or what have you, make sure it can process bounces. Excessive attempts to deliver to dead addresses is the number one metric used by large email receivers to assess your mailserver IP's reputation.<p>Keep your list clean. Don't be tempted to add those 150 random names and addresses you found from last year's marketing push. It's not worth it. One or two bad records on your list is enough to completely decimate your delivery rates. Stick to double opt-in and don't be tempted.<p>Make your unsubscribe link obvious. Really obvious. Like, at the top of your email, or in big black text. Too many people feel the need to hide their unsubscribe link away in tiny text at the very bottom. If someone doesn't want your email, they have two choices - spambox it, or unsubscribe. If many people spambox your email - your delivery rates <i>will</i> suffer. Make unsubscribing easy and obvious.",1257750991

930540,comment,930477,930524,0,0,bertramm,,,"I disagree with the above description of a Nash equilibrium. My understanding of such a thing is: When a Nash equilibrium exists each player's best strategy to the others create a ""equilibrium"" point, or a point from which you don't deviate. In a sense a change in government creates a change in game, not necessarily a Nash EQ. A Nash EQ in a society with a generally ""Capitalist"" economic, with supporting legal statutes, potentially result in players robbing, stealing, or cheating. However, in a game in which ""Communism"" is the economic standard, a Nash EQ may be universal altruism or chaos (my hypothesis to two possible Nash EQ's --not based in observation).Thus it is incorrect to blanketly label ""Communism"" or ""Socialism"" as a Nash EQ. In a sense a Nash EQ doesn't care about the morality of its players behaviors only that it is a relative equilibrium which results in best strategies that do not deviate in play.<p>See this Yale open course: <a href=""http://oyc.yale.edu/economics/game-theory/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oyc.yale.edu/economics/game-theory/</a>.",1257750037

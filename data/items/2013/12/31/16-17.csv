During any of the discussion of this thread, I don&#x27;t see generalized opinions, the discussion was very direct in discussing one topic: firearms used for suicide. You were the one to attempt to generalize my statement by taking it outside the context of the discussion.<p>If I had walked up to you and made my statement without any context whatsoever then you would be absolutely correct, which I said before.<p>Thanks for the link, it supports my argument quite well that punishing all for the actions of an individual is not always the correct course of action. It actually goes beyond what I was saying since I was only speaking of restricting someone based on what another person does to themselves.",1388509114

If you google &quot;Python training&quot; you&#x27;re going to get books, sites that offer training from 2.5 to 3.3. And those are recent sites (like 2012+).<p>Not to mention pip and package management - which compared to ruby, is just terrible. I mean there isn&#x27;t even an update all command in pip. And of course if you have different versions of python you have different versions of pip. With different version of packages installed.<p>And now for virtualenv. Ok great tool. But even in this area there&#x27;s confusion. Different people use different environment managers. And virtualenv isn&#x27;t the easiest thing to setup - from a new users point of view. Where in ruby there&#x27;s gem. It&#x27;s installed with ruby. Period.<p>The community isn&#x27;t doing itself any favors by dragging their feet. Everyone should jump onboard the python3 wagon. And if you need a package that isn&#x27;t 3, then rewrite or look for something else. Maybe if the maintainers of said packages knew that their users weren&#x27;t gonna stand for not supporting version 3 they&#x27;d get off their butts and convert - or release the code and let the community convert the package for them.",1388509106

6991426,comment,6988895,6990356,1,0,aaronem,,,"I made much the same arguments before I bought my first smartphone. Turns out they&#x27;re a lot more useful than you notice when you&#x27;re only looking for reasons to dislike the whole concept.<p>For an example from my own experience, I used to do a lot of contract IT work, both freelance and as part of a firm, often visiting several clients over the course of a day. Originally I&#x27;d keep track of everything in an old-fashioned spiral-bound pocket notebook, but dead trees are hard to grep, especially remotely, and at the rate at which I filled notebooks it got to be a real pain having to copy and distill everything worth keeping track of from the old one to the new one. I had an old-fashioned candybar phone, too, which worked well enough for phone calls and text messages, and if I had to, I could use it to talk a client through power-cycling a server and other similarly simple procedures, which was at least a little better than having to go out and do it myself, or back to the office where I could remote into the client&#x27;s PDU.<p>So I bought an iPhone. Thus, with a modicum of effort, I gained a shared, always up-to-date calendar, providing both an agenda of upcoming events and a searchable record of what I&#x27;d done and when; an always-connected email client, providing both an easy means of keeping in touch while on the road and, again, a searchable record of past communications; a shared, collated, searchable collection of notes concerning every relevant detail of my various clients&#x27; operations; a shared, &c., collection of contact information for all my various clients and industry contacts; and, last but not least, an always-connected administrative terminal with which to remotely solve even relatively subtle and complex problems, as and when necessary, for clients who had urgent needs and for whom I could not fit an in-person emergency visit into my schedule.<p>No doubt all of this makes it sound as though I was a preposterously busy person, and for several years that&#x27;s exactly what I was. My smartphone enabled me to streamline my efforts in a fashion which I had hardly imagined possible before I first laid hands on the means of so doing, to the extent that it made me able to get <i>more</i> work done, with <i>less</i> effort, than I had been able to accomplish before. If there is any purpose at all behind our species&#x27; longstanding habit of building interesting trinkets and gewgaws, &quot;more work with less effort&quot; is certainly the very soul of that purpose.<p>I do, though, like your &quot;only frivolous people with frivolous purposes would ever have a smartphone&quot; argument, though. I think that&#x27;s the most sensible thing anyone has said in this whole thread. Certainly it is in no way redolent of, for example, someone who bravely defies his ignorance in order to declaim at length on a subject of which he has absolutely no relevant experience whatsoever.",1388509041

Of course, that is hard/impossible to quantify and it, ideally, should be done per cohort (hard to do, as we don&#x27;t even know what graduates from 2010 will make 5 years after graduation), but it would be a telling graph, I think.<p>Another way to show the issue in a honest way would be to estimate the number of years it takes graduates to pay back their loans. Again, hard to estimate (a student with $40,000 in income probably _could_ pay back a $20,000 debt in a year, but is it reasonable to expect that?)<p>And, of course, it would probably be very useful to see the combined distribution of (debt,income) pairs. If all students have a debt of 20k, and income of 40k, there is little to worry about. It is more likely, however, that both debts and incomes show large variations, and are only poorly correlated. The data set will both contain that dropout with a company worth millions, a trained neurosurgeon with 100+ k in debt that gets into an accident that invalidates his/her hand just before (s)he has the money to pay for insurance, and a talented, but a bit slow art student with limited commercial talent.",1388508466

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ever happening in that specific form; mostly because it would require that the Django ORM&#x27;s behavior and usage contract not change at all in order to support backwards compatibility.  This would be a very large task, at the very least for Django and probably for us as we make adjustments to support them.   The feel and behavior of Django&#x27;s ORM would invariably change quite palpably - even if you can get every function input and output to match, you still have what it looks like when you get a stack trace, an error message, etc.   Django users would see lots of unfamiliar &quot;sqlalchemy&quot; lines in these stack traces and tracking down issues would then involve both Django and SQLAlchemy devs.   Performance would also be a concern - keeping behavior exactly as is within Django might require some odd workarounds or additional logic which could prove to be complex and/or less performant.<p>That said, I have on occasion floated an alternative idea, which is to basically port the Django configurational and query system to SQLAlchemy entirely, doing away with full backwards compatibility and essentially providing a &quot;transitional&quot; platform, where you take an existing Django application and basically run it on top of a new ORM layer that actually uses the SQLAlchemy Session and unit of work model, but the majority of the Django configuration and queryset behavior remains available, thus making porting a relatively painless process (but still, there&#x27;d be a porting process).    This approach has two advantages.  One is, it&#x27;s actually doable, we&#x27;re providing a new platform and not trying to duplicate an existing one.  The other is, we&#x27;re actually delivering to a Django application some of the biggest advantages SQLAlchemy has, which are namely the ORM features like unit of work/identity map, the instrumentation model including collections and eager loading support, and inheritance support.<p>Nobody has time / motivation for that idea either, but I think if it ever happened, it would be more pragmatic.",1388506750

I have seen firsthand the problems involved in hiring a growth/optimizer in a pre-fit situation, and of hiring a generalist into a specialized role. Some people can fill either capacity, but those people are rare.<p>One thing I&#x27;d add to the generalist/full-stack marketer&#x27;s skill set is Brand. Brand is insanely underrated at early startups, and it goes far beyond logos and web or app design elements. What is your company about? What is its voice? What does it stand for? What do your prospective customers believe it is? How are these things being articulated consistently in <i>every</i> facet of the site, the app, the messaging, the marketing channels, and so forth?<p>In the search for fit, these questions are extremely important -- not as arbitrary determinations, but as serious pieces of the fit puzzle. A pre-fit startup without a distinctive voice and identity in the marketplace is at a potentially serious disadvantage. It&#x27;s a very challenging problem because it&#x27;s sort of a chicken-and-egg dilemma: it involves both induction and deduction. It both leads and follows from the customer development process. Customer development and brand identity do not necessarily progress in linear, teleological fashion -- which is the standard presumption (&quot;I&#x27;ll hire the brand role when we know who we&#x27;re talking to&quot;).<p>I could see the argument that this is the founder&#x27;s role. To some degree it is. Maybe your startup is blessed with a Steve Jobsian founder who just has a knack for brand marketing. Maybe your startup has a designer co-founder who feels he or she has a firm 80/20 handle on the subject. But a lot of startups don&#x27;t, and they underestimate the importance of it (or the liability of not having it).",1388505914

Dead obvious questions that can be easily Googled or are repeats are flagged and often removed.<p>Sure in an ideal world someone answering that very specific question that is difficult to answer would get more credit but it is not perfect.  That is also why the bounty system exists because someone can have a specific hard to answer question that would be very beneficial to them while not many others would be helped and thus upvote.

You <i>need</i> to check fingerprints (attempts to make this &quot;friendly&quot; with images and the like have tended to have vulnerabilities). Beyond that, what&#x27;s your issue with OTR? A separate network has the advantage of not having to do the negotiation step of OTR-over-jabber/AIM/etc, but it will have bootstrapping problems (or maybe not; maybe a well-designed app that just used OTR all the time, on a new network, would be enough).",1388505665

6991105,comment,6985717,6990799,1,0,talmand,,,"Again, having a gun increases the likelihood of succeeding in the attempt. It allows for snap decisions is also true. But I do not agree that it contributes to the act in of itself.<p>A perfect example of this someone pointed out elsewhere; Japan has an incredibly high suicide rate. It is apparently the leading cause of death of men and women in the younger age brackets. Japan has little to no gun culture. From what I&#x27;ve read, people there are attempting to address the why&#x27;s of the situation instead of tackling the how&#x27;s as it would change nothing.<p>People who talk of restricting people&#x27;s access to guns because of other people&#x27;s choices of using those gun on themselves is attempting to tackle the how&#x27;s of the problem and not discussing the why&#x27;s. It restricts people&#x27;s rights without actually solving anything.<p>I have no problems with restricting access to someone with suicidal thoughts, although that&#x27;s tough to determine how to go about that fairly. But it&#x27;s a completely different thing to restrict a person&#x27;s rights because his neighbor is suicidal.<p>As for guns designed for things other than killing. The easiest examples are shotguns. There are a number of shotguns specifically designed for clay sports. There&#x27;s even a difference in designs between a shotgun intended for trap and skeet. In trap the clay flies away from you so the shotgun is designed to sling lead as far and as accurately as possible. In skeet the lead doesn&#x27;t have to travel far but you often have to be able to swing the gun from left-to-right rather quickly, so it is designed with that in mind. Then there are shotguns designed for you to carry in the field and shoot birds. There is often overlap in these designs and the guns designed for clay sports can of course be used to kill living things. But that&#x27;s not what they are designed for.<p>There are many other examples, such as the very one you describe.<p>If you want to discuss the aspect of something being designed to kill, a better and more accurate discussion is about ammunition. A gun is something designed to sling a projectile at high speeds. You can take any gun and insert blanks to make it useless for just about anything.",1388505622

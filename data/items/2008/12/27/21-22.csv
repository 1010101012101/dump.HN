411414,comment,410930,411383,0,0,DaniFong,,,"To be fair, most men aren't pursuing careers in mathematics either. The population of professional mathematicians is a puny subset of the population at large. Even a tiny effects of cumulative cultural mores, when working on people subject to a threshold so far out they're so far out on the bell curve, can have an exponentially disproportionate effect.<p>Many of the women physicists I've become friends with spoke fondly of the first time they encountered a female scientist, either on screen, in print, or in person. They said it was the first time they realized that one could be a woman, and a scientist. It sounds absurd, but remember, this happened when they were kids. No imagine it happened just two years later. A few year's head start on knowing what you want to be can make the difference on what becomes your professional identity, and what you explore and do, ie: your training.<p>I was only speaking last night about this with my friend, who just graduated with a PhD in astrophysics from Princeton, and is now a postdoc at Berkeley. She placed the turning point on when she heard about Jane Goodall, who wasn't just 'in' science, but revolutionizing it. I encountered science (and a notion of utilitarianism) through Marie Curie, what she discovered, what a revolution she sparked, and how it lead to her death. It was difficult emotionally, but I decided that to discover something so valuable, and so important, paying with one's life would have been worth it.",1230415064
411413,comment,410512,411400,0,0,jerf,,,"""I agree that the basic kind of school system everyone uses is broken, but the US exported that? I think it predates the US."" - it's... complicated. The ideas originated in Europe, but took hold here strongest, then spread with the industrial revolution (later phase, not early phase). That's the short-short version.<p>""what system would you suggest?"" - The Swiss system you describe is what I would suggest. Perhaps not in every detail, because I'm sure you don't capture the full complexity in two sentences :).<p>The way in which it is <i>not</i> the same lies in the individuals ability to punish their provider, thus closing the feedback loop that markets critically depend on. (Where there is no feedback loop, there is no market, period. Another example: Monopolies are bad because they destroy the feedback loop, because there is no ""elsewhere"" to take your business.) When the health-care provider is your government, it basically has no reason to care whether you are being served well. (Odds are, the health-care providing part is not even elected so even the only feedback loop a government has is not in play.) It has no competition. In the US, there is only ever so slightly more feedback; technically, if enough of the company complained to HR, they might consider changing the plans they offer, but that's still a very diffuse feedback loop with a central point of failure (HR, easily bribed, or even just overloaded to the point where they can't afford to look at alternatives).<p>If you're buying insurance individually, and you have the ability to change it as easily as changing my car insurance would be, then you have a market feedback loop, even if you've got the government fiddling around the edges. (I'm only a little-l libertarian, so I'm not necessarily opposed to that, even as I think the US and UK systems are grossly flawed.) For all the rhetoric about the coldness of the capitalist system, you generally get more caring and concern from an entity you can abandon at will than one that gets your money regardless of what you think and has no real incentive to care.<p>(I also observe this doesn't fix <i>every</i> problem. But what I think it would do is get things moving in the right direction, and create forces that could help resolve the rest. Right now, the dominant forces tend to make things worse and worse over time, instead, as we continually move farther and farther towards <i>guessing</i> what will work... and <i>politicians</i> guessing, no less... instead of actually having the information necessary to figure it out.)",1230414975

I think it predates the US.<p>I live in Switzerland.  No government involvement is not realistic, but in Switzerland you are required to have your own health insurance (changing jobs has no effect on it).  The government gets involved by putting a cap on how much insurance companies can make, which makes it less useful for them to use sleazy tricks to try and maximize profits.<p>As far as the UK being basically the same thing, what system would you suggest?  I personally like the Swiss system the best of everything I've seen, but it could be argued that it is just a variation of what the UK has.  That is, we all <i>must</i> have insurance, therefor we all <i>must</i> pay for it and the major expenses that people I don't know end up costing <i>me</i> more money.  The only real difference is that the insurance isn't government owned and there is some competition in it.<p>But I can't imagine a system that could work better then these.  The only other thing you could do is simply not cover some percentage of the people, but the US is a pretty solid example case that this doesn't work well.  I believe that the reason employers are paying insurance is because the plans are already quite expensive and the employers can get a major group discount.",1230414500

Working at Yahoo, I've been around for a couple pretty huge property changes, and then the deployment process is very different.<p>Basically, hardware is much cheaper than downtime, and very big web companies have lots more money. So we don't swap out old servers gradually: instead we buy and set up an entirely new set of servers, deploy to them several weeks in advance of the planned launch, and run QA against these production-level boxes. Then, when we are ready to ""launch"", all we're really doing is a relatively low-risk DNS change: all the potentially tricky deployment issues having been ironed out beforehand.<p>After a couple of weeks/months of operation on the new hardware, if there have been no major problems, the old boxes are decommissioned -- either re-imaged and put back into service to expand capacity, or more often taken out of service entirely (I've no idea what we do with old boxes when we stop using them, funnily enough).",1230414436

This can be done dynamically or statically -- really it depends on the nature of your system, in general something will stand out as obviously right for your situation.<p>To take an example, if your service is primarily user centric, you can partition the system by user and roll out accordingly. Let's say you have four interacting systems: a font end proxy which understands the partition boundaries, an appserver, a caching system, and a database -- pretty typical.<p>The front end proxy in this system is shared by all users (this need not always be true as you can do subdomain and dns games, but that is a different major headache), but everything behind it can be dedicated to the partition (this is not necessarily efficient, but it is easy).<p>Now, let's say we need to make a backwards-incompatible,coordinated change to the appserver and databases associated with the partition. As we cannot roll these atomically without downtime we pick an order, let's say appserver first. In this case we will wind up rolling two actual changes to the appserver and one to the databases.<p>The appserver will go from A (the initial) to an A' which is compatible with both A and B databases, then the databases will go from A to B, and the appservers from A' to B. You'll do this on one small partition and once done, let it bake for a while. After that, you'll roll the same across more. Typically going to exponentially more of the system (ie, 1 partition, 2 partitions, 4 partitions, 8 partitions, etc).<p>This means you have a, hopefully short lived, interim release of one or more components, which is probably grossly inefficient, but you wind up in a stable state when complete. The cost of doing this is not pleasant, as you basically triple QA time (final state, interim state, two upgrade transitions) and add a non-trivial chunk of development time (interim state). That said, this is why most folks just take the downtime until the cost of the downtime is greater than cost of extra development.<p>This is, of course, a pain in the ass to coordinate. It is easy to do with relatively small big systems (less than a few hundred servers, say, assuming you have good deployment automation), and probably the pain of coordinating is still less than the pain of baking component versioning into everything... for a while.<p>An alternate model, which requires significantly more up front investment, is to support this in a multi-tenant system where you don't (for upgrade purposes) dedicate a clone of the system to each partition. Instead you can bake version awareness into service discovery and dynamically route requests accordingly.<p>A very traditional (of the blue-suited variety) is to use an MQ system for all RPCs and tag versioning into the request, then select from the queue incorporating the version. This makes the upgrade almost trivial from a code-execution point of view, and can even help with data migration as you can queue up updates during the intermediate state database and play a catch-up game to flip over to the end state database. This is the subject for a blog post, though, rather than a comment, as it is kind of hairy :-)",1230411702

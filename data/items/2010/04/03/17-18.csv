1238900,comment,1238542,1238542,0,0,hxa7241,,,"> "". . . most design problems we face in creating software can be resolved only through experimentation with a partially running system. Engineering is and always has been fundamentally such an enterprise, no matter how much we would like it to be more like science than like art.""<p>This is not a very good way of putting it. The essence of engineering is determinate knowledge, i.e. scientific, logical knowledge. That is not to say it excludes other things, or that that essence alone is sufficient, just that it is the definitive, distinctive, fundamental feature.<p>Experiment produces determinate knowledge -- the most specific, detailed kind. Scientific research produces the broad, general know-how, and experiment fills the gaps for a particular task. If engineering were not fundamentally about determinate knowledge, then experiment could not work. The knowledge produced by the experimental trial would not even have the generality to transfer to the intended use.<p>Associating engineering and software with art seems of little value. From what I remember of aesthetic philosophy, art does not have substantial, useful, or perhaps any correspondence with engineering -- let alone the vagueness of what art is anyway. One cannot fault the real content of the article, but the arty leaning is ultimately empty.<p>The limit of engineering is evolution, not art. When there is no knowledge, engineering design can't work, and instead evolution is the way. Proof of the effectiveness of that alternate approach is all around.",1270317548

They were no better or worse than other i-banks, interspersing themselves into the money flow, probably sucking out more value than they were creating -- I think so. The fault is with the government for bailing them out. They should be bankrupt, shareholders\nwiped out, company carved up and sold off, making room for better companies. Instead the government decided to give them billions (which they paid out as bonuses to themselves). It was ludicrous, the government gave them 100 cents on the dollar for AIG.

In moderation to give you a boost, it would probably be fine, but you definitely shouldn't get a significant amount of calories from straight sugar.<p>As a vegetarian who has to worry about protein, I think about that a lot. Basically, the more crap you eat with no nutritional value, the more nutrient-dense the rest of your food has to be.<p>So if I got all my calories from rice, I'd be fine protein-wise. But if I eat 500+ calories of various things-that-are-just-fat-and-sugar, I need to eat more protein-dense food, like lentils. (Not that just eating rice would be healthy anyway.

The biggest problem is outlined by your initial question ""If I am switching to a totally new OS, why does it have to be from Microsoft"". I think, that such a question shouldn't, ever, be guiding a companies strategies. But for Microsoft, it is. Their products legitimate their existence through their Windows-Brand heritage. \nThe actual question that they _should_ ask themselves should rather be ""What innovative features could we create, that would make customers crave for our products"". \nSadly, their whole corporate culture has stunning difficulties coming to terms with this line of thinking.<p>A new Non-Windows Microsoft-OS might actually work, if it would be crammed full of breathtaking, innovative, extraordinary great features (whereby features I mean useful, life-enhancing ideas, not gimmicks).

Being in a social setting with someone is what was social. Putting a picture of someone on Facebook is social. You can still comment on an auto-tagged picture just the same as a manually-tagged one. The only difference is that you save some time for those people who contribute the most (the friends who take dozens of pictures at every event and then spend a couple hours uploading/tagging them the next day). By decreasing the necessary effort of photo-sharing, I would expect to see more uploading and tagging.<p>A side benefit is that it could eventually make discovery easier. How many pictures do you have at a bar or somewhere else with a bunch of people you don't know in the background? How many times have you hung out someone somewhere, have a picture of them, but didn't get or can't remember their name? Automatic recognition gives you a better chance of meeting some of these people again.<p>For those saying this is a privacy issue, the uploader doesn't have to see the auto-tag of a non-friend. Instead, the person who has been auto-tagged could be notified and have the option of allowing/disallowing the tag to occur.",1270316748

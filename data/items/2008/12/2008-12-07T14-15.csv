It works great for me, and I like having many fingers in many pies, but I'm pretty convinced it only works because of my personality.<p>Would Google, Microsoft or Apple be where they are now if the founders had decided to work on several things at once? All reasonably single minded people involved there who threw their all into their respective companies.<p>I'm never going to found a 8 or 9 figure revenue company because I don't want to be <i>that</i> focused or <i>that</i> single minded. Fine for me, but the people who <i>do</i> want that option are probably best off <i>not</i> dating more than one girl, right?",1228661886

388891,comment,388885,388885,0,0,time_management,,,"The analogy you're making reminds me of the quote, ""VCs are like women: they only want you if others do.""<p>You're absolutely correct that, before a deal is sealed (signed term sheet, or relationship) in either arena, it makes sense not only to keep open as many options as possible, but also to seek out more open options. Your ""game"" will failbox if you only have one prospect, because this person has an incredible amount of power over you. Of course, eventually, you have to take the plunge and commit to one.<p>However, the analogy between women and funding is pretty weak. The most obvious difference is that sources of funding are pretty much interchangeable, and it's utterly necessary to get some sort of funding, so it makes sense to jump on the first reasonable offer. Women, on the other hand, are decidedly <i>not</i> interchangeable, while there's no need to be in a relationship, so it makes sense to be picky and hold out for an exceptionally good match.",1228661768

388888,comment,388876,388876,0,0,petercooper,,,"<i>but these are all superficial next to the damage done by all the absolutely atrocious Perl code out there.</i><p>The writer argues that Perl's being damaged by bad code examples, but if that were the case, PHP would be the least popular language in the world, no?<p>Perl's troubles are not just because of bad code examples, because the language is poorly constructed (in terms of v5, v6 is a lot better), or because its marketing is poor/non-existent.. but because of <i>all</i> of these things and many other issues beside (especially the difficulty of deployment). These issues are enough to make one jump ship after years of non-resolution.<p>(I was a nearly full-time Perl developer from 1996-2005 - haven't touched it at all in the last few years since I jumped ship to Ruby, so it's not as if I'm hating on the language without having once loved it ;-))",1228661045

Its great that its become vastly cheaper to create a new Internet product.<p>There are many other industries that can make use of VC; green tech, for example.  VC isn't dying, its just going to focus on different industry segments.",1228660851

Whether there's credible evidence or not as to a Google OS wasn't my point -- it's that the _idea_ of Google doing that wouldn't strike you as crazy, and that just brings up the question ""what could they do with it?""<p>Linus did a very, very good job for the single isolated box.  A kernel that had very deep ties to a greater infrastructure, a true internet computer, though, would have a huge value proposition for a lot of users, especially in business.  I guess this thread could have been better titled, ""Challenge HN: Extend the Linux kernel to do low level process splitting and handle a remote file system natively, to have the computer run partially on a distributed infrastructure as needed.""  I'd be amazed if Google aren't the ones to do this. If they aren't, though, we'll be welcoming some new names to the computing billionaires' club in the next few years.",1228660715

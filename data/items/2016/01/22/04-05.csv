Somebody has to decide who gets which capabilities.  That mechanism needs to be understandable by the user.  For example,<p>Privileges for a game:<p>- Can use full screen.<p>- Can read own content installed with app.<p>- Can read/write persistent storage associated with app.<p>- Can communicate with domain &quot;thisgame.ea.com&quot;.<p>- Cannot run in background, access address book, ...<p>Word processor:<p>- Can access files mentioned in user file dialogs (file dialogs being run from a separate process).<p>- Can transmit requests to send mail to app &quot;mail&quot;.<p>For any app which accesses information outside its own content and own persistent storage, the user should have the options &quot;allow&quot;, &quot;deny&quot;, and &quot;fake&quot;.  If a program asks for address book access and won&#x27;t run without it, you can give it the &quot;fake&quot; option, which gives it access to a dummy address book.

So the imbalance is somewhat self-correcting, it&#x27;s just that human lives are getting to be longer while the time between inventions that obviate the need for human labor seems to be getting shorter.<p>Longer average lifespans (with the same legal retirement age for social security, medical benefits) exacerbate this problem.<p>But there is always one industry that can be fueled by human lives and that looks great on an economic balance sheet - war. It decreases surplus labor, increases nationalism and social cohesion (if people generally see the necessity of the war), and injects a huge stimulus of demand into the economy through gov spending on all sorts of goods for the war effort, as well as investments in R&D that adds to the country&#x27;s infrastructure base.<p>If the latency between idle/restless/poor/disenfranchised population and meaningful/useful jobs gets to be too large, then all it takes is a spark to start a protest, rebellion, or war as people have nothing else to really live for.<p>* I would use GDP/capita to have a more quantifiable benchmark, but I find GDP to be almost completely useless when accounting for things that matter to actual human beings such as quality of social cohesion, potential social mobility, amount of pollution, etc.",1453435880

This article is about a content producer that invested in Android yet failed.  Instead of talking about how the content producers need to do more, we should be talking about why this effort failed.<p>Here's a start:  when you buy an iphone today the Newsstand is one of a handful of Apps you start with.  It's featured and people click on it and then many of them start buying and consuming content.  What is the competing experience on Android?  I assume there's no equivalent to the standalone Newsstand App installed by default on the phone.  I assume they hit Play, which incidentally is terribly named and many customers never click on ever because they think it only leads to pokemon. Then they have to know that Magazines on their Device are a thing now and find them on which may be easy or hard in Play but is still an order of magnitude harder than it is on iOS.",1357009044

In banking failure is not an option, a little detail that I keep having to drill into my collegues, some of who would rather have an MVP with the occasional bit of downtime than something a lot more solid. So for now we're stuck in the 'hurd' loop.<p>Within any start-up there are always differing opinions on the level of reliability required. My first real job in IT was with the Dutch division of the Chase Mannhattan bank, they made it pretty clear upon hiring me that they did not mind hiring me into a responsible position as young as I was but that my first fuck-up would also be my last. I'm not sure if they would actually follow through on that promise but it certainly made me a bit more wary and more responsible. The fact that I ended up leaving of my own accord means that their threat probably had its intended effect.<p>When you're in the payment chain, whether as an IPSP, a bank or something else that directly affects peoples income and ability to function in society you have no excuse other than 'meteor fragments took out all three of our datacenters'.<p>Stuff is up, check-totals are at '0', transactions are never lost. 24 hours, 365 (of 366) days per year.<p>If you can't do that don't bother playing.<p>The bank I'm with (Rabobank in nl) lost a lot of respect from me (after building that up for 2 decades) when they blamed a bunch of down time on 'hackers'. What bugged me even more than the fact that they were down was the fact that they wanted to blame another party for being down.<p>The one thing I'll leave a little bit of room for is capacity issues during the holiday shopping spree, but even that is pretty bad form and indicative of very bad planning.<p>Judging by the post the error lies with Simple's partner, unfortunately for Simple customers will likely not care about that at all. To them their simple card doesn't work when they expect it to work.<p>I hope for simple they'll be able to fix this very quickly.",1357008999

Surely, <i>surely</i>, ending slavery has to be an option too?<p>-----<p>My favorite slavery thought experiment concerns democratic slavery:<p>One day, a slave notices that his owner is, well, something of a dictator. He's the only guy in charge, and hey, who picked him anyway?<p>So the slaves get together and demand the right to vote to <i>choose</i> their slave owner. (The possibility that slavery might be wrong, in and of itself, does not occur to them.)<p>Two different slave owner ""parties"" arise (let's call them the Rs and Ds), and every four years, the slaves are given the opportunity to vote for the slave owner candidate from the R party, the D party, and usually one (or sometimes two) fringe candidates not associated with either party.<p>The slaves do a great ""get out the vote"" effort to choose their slave owner for the next four years, but still, less than half of the slaves vote.<p>Those slaves that don't vote for a new slave owner are told to STFU about slavery, since they didn't vote, by the slaves who did vote.<p>Now replace ""slavery"" with ""government"", ""slave owners"" with ""politicians"", and ""citizen"" with ""slave"".<p>At the very least, it should be clear that the act of <i>voting</i> doesn't legitimize government, just like voting doesn't legitimize slavery (which is not the same as saying government is <i>illegitimate</i>, it may be, or may not be, but voting doesn't make it so).<p>Voting also doesn't confer any moral benefit over those that choose not to vote, for similar reasons -- those telling non-voters to STFU are, in fact, wrong to do so.<p>-----<p>All of this is to say that, it seems to me, the mere <i>existence</i> of a thing, regardless of its ""immense"" power, doesn't mean anything with regard to whether we should attempt to prop it up further, ignore it, or tear it down.<p>And as with the democratically-elected slave owners, even the presence of things like 'voting' and 'elections' is no guarantee that the system (slavery) is in any way moral -- voting slaves are still <i>slaves</i>, after all.<p>IMO no one should feel obligated to help an entity they believe is actively hostile to their own, or others, interests -- regardless of the current power and/or respect said entity has with their peers -- government included.",1357005644

They don&#x27;t have the money to profit from lots of new builds, so its easier to constrain supply, and the general public who own houses will think they&#x27;ve never had it so good because their house is worth more.<p>Same thing in the US but for the arms industry.<p>Also mix in the fact that huge numbers of new build London apartments are being kept empty by Chinese owners (and others) and you&#x27;ve got a crisis waiting to happen.<p>There&#x27;s going to be a tipping point for London - when young white collar workers such as software developers, accountants, graphic designers, marketing professionals and the other skills that make London competitive won&#x27;t be arsed to travel to London for 1-2 hours, or live in a shoebox to get a salary that&#x27;s 15% higher than in Leeds, Birmingham or Manchester where they could have a large house.<p>The way out isn&#x27;t just building more property, but passing laws that force owners to rent out properties when they own more than say 3 or 4.

  in vain and your faith is in vain. We are even found
  to be misrepresenting God, because we testified about
  God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if
  it is true that the dead are not raised. For if the
  dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised.
  And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is

I think a lot of people are correct that there is a powerful philosophy in Christianity, but to ignore the existence of God and Jesus, specifically the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ, is to ignore the main (constantly reiterated) point of the Bible.

Ever. I&#x27;m willing to pay for that with cpu time or i/o speed, that&#x27;s like the first 90% of my requirements.<p>The second criteria is that it&#x27;s generally lean and doesn&#x27;t do anything stupid algorithmically. It should support <i>big</i> files, provide relatively fast directory lookups (so that &#x27;find&#x27; will run fast), and have some decent way of packing files onto the disk that doesn&#x27;t defragment the allocations too badly, and ideally do some book-keeping during idle i/o so that I don&#x27;t really have to run a defragmenter, ever. But these are kind of secondary requirements that aren&#x27;t worth anything unless the file system keeps my files uncorrupted and accessible first and foremost.",1437649559

Videotext? Can&#x27;t remember). Because we did not have any video equipment or laser printer, he ended up taking pictures of the screen with his Reflex and then have them printed on actual slides. His colleagues were in awe. Now I can&#x27;t believe he went to all that trouble!<p>By the time I actually paid some attention to the manuals and tried my hand at Workbench stuff, Amiga was on its way out. I ended up using an IBM emulator to run WordPerfect, and then just moved to a Windows 3.1 laptop; by then, &quot;real&quot; games had moved to consoles anyway.",1437649222

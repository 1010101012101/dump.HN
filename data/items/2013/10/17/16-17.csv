Several users have actually emailed me to thank me for bringing their family closer together.<p>StoryWorth brings up questions you don&#x27;t typically ask. The next time you talk on the phone, instead of talking about what happened last week, you end up talking about your parents&#x27; high-school, or what they were like at your age.<p>I mean, ideally we&#x27;d all take the time to sit down with our parents and a voice recorder, but that rarely happens. If StoryWorth can get you started down that path, then next time you see them in person, you&#x27;ll have some really interesting things to talk about.<p>[stylistic edit]",1382029140
6566599,comment,6565513,6566144,6,0,tenfingers,,,"GTK3 has a very small adoption rate for cross-desktop/OS applications. Except for the gnome DE (which I&#x27;m not using), on my system the only two applications using GTK3 are wireshark and lightdm. Heck, even GIMP on Debian is still using GTK2.<p>QT4+ is faster than GTK3, the API is superior in almost every respect, has better cross-platform OS support. It should be telling to every user how some basic widgets like the file-open dialog in GTK3 has actually regressed in every respect compared to GTK2, and many others actually behave worse from the user&#x27;s point of view (which should be the #1 priority of any widget system, even before the API).<p>I used to prefer GTK for the footprint (and mind you, I was always aiming at pure X11 development), but not anymore.",1382029134

The framers were familiar with FPTP, and familiar with the way that parties operated under it. It wasn&#x27;t a new idea that they were trying out expecting that it would avoid the formation of parties.<p>It&#x27;s inaccurate to even say that &quot;the framers&quot; had a coherent desire to avoid parties -- <i>Washington</i> certainly did, and this certainly got more urgent for him as the First Party System took hold during is term as President; <i>Hamilton</i> may have initially opposed parties in the traditional democratic sense since he was more inclined to a life-term aristocracy (remember that he wanted both Presidents and Senators to serve &quot;in good behavior&quot; -- that is, for life subject to impeachment -- the way that in the Constitution-as-it-ended-up federal judges do), but he seems to have readily accepted political parties as the second-best choice; <i>Jefferson</i> clearly saw parties as an inherent part of democracy, and the absence of parties as a feature of despotism, and actually seemed to see <i>a two party system divided on a particular axis</i> -- which he referred to as Whig v. Tory -- as <i>fundamental and inherent in the nature of mankind</i>, though he also was clearly opposed to tribal <i>adherence</i> to parties.",1382029005

6566573,comment,6564504,6564504,7,0,thomasmeeks,,,"Documentation does not exist for your own benefit. It exists to help other people on the team, or the programmer that inherits your code, quickly understand your code. The key word here is quickly. Yes, a programmer can trace code & figure it out. On a large chunk of code, however, that is exceedingly inefficient. Whether or not documentation is obvious to the person that wrote it is a very poor test for the documentation&#x27;s utility.<p>I used to hold a similar opinion -- &quot;Document the non-obvious&quot;. The problem is that in a project of sufficient size, almost everything can slide towards non-obvious. Is price the base price, or unit price * quantity? Is the method name cancel_subscription_and_notify_customer really effective? Of course, I could use cancel_subscription, but then I&#x27;m not telling programmers about the email that goes out, or cancel_subscription_and_notify, but who am I notifying? The marketing department? Generally I find really descriptive method names to get unwieldy very fast. Further, if you say document the non-obvious, the tendency is towards zero documentation.<p>The value statement depends on how fast your team grows or changes, and the expected lifetime of the project.<p>If you are working on a project alone, and that will never change (e.g. it isn&#x27;t something a business relies on), then you probably do not need documentation. This is also true if you are bringing on a dev a year, and the team size will always remain relatively small. Similarly, if the project is relatively short-lived (like a game), then dropping documentation could be a good idea. Maybe, I&#x27;d at least concede there are merits to doing so. Documentation isn&#x27;t free, of course.<p>On the other hand, if you are working at a company that&#x27;s trying to rapidly grow, needs to bring on devs quickly, or has developers moving from one project to another frequently, then I&#x27;d say documentation is very important. You are going to save your team a huge amount of time by taking a little time upfront to explain what you are doing, why, and the consequences of each method. Even simple methods deserve documentation for consistency sake.<p>If your documentation rots, then you handle it the same way as test rot. Make sure the team knows that docs are necessary, they need to spend the time on it, and if that means more time for features, so be it. I can say from experience that writing documentation after the fact is pretty gnarly.",1382028909

In fact, they were taken from insiders.<p>I&#x27;m old enough to remember trading on US stock exchanges in the mid 1990s when prices where quoted in 1/8s and 1/16s and NYSE specialists were the only ones with visibility into order book. Think about it: you as an investor had no idea of the depth of the order book, but the specialist who took the other side of the trade from you had it in front of him. The specialists were minting money. They would lose money maybe one day per quarter, and their ROEs were ludicrous.<p>HFT and ECN trading killed them. Labranche, Van der Moolen, Susquehanna, Spear Leeds, all gone. Goldman Sachs bought Spear Leeds for $6 billion in 2000 (it is now no more); Labranche specialist business fetched only $25m when it was sold to Barclays in 2010. Van der Moolen went bankrupt in 2010.<p>Investment bank trading desks, true champions of customer front-running, are shrinking fast. Cash equity trading has become so tough for the banks that they are starting to think of it as a cost center, a loss leader to promote their equity underwriting business.<p>These were multi-billion dollar businesses, with tens of thousands of middlemen living high on the hog from the spreads and front-running. They&#x27;re all (mostly) gone. Good riddance.<p>If you want to relive the old days of trading before HFT, go execute a large trade on Karachi Stock Exchange.

I found the following paragraph particularly salient:<p>>> In the 20th century, the boss system selected such presidents as Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy. I was struck at how a self-evidently corrupt and undemocratic system would have selected such impressive candidates (albeit along with Warren Harding and other less impressive ones). The system should not have worked, but on the whole, it worked better than we might have imagined. I leave to others to judge how these compare to post-reform candidates like Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush or Barack Obama.<p>Kennedy and Roosevelt were the epitome of boss driven politicians, and while many argue over how effective they actually were, no one can argue that were not highly influential.  I&#x27;m personally a fan of Coolidge as well.

The point isn&#x27;t that &quot;What&#x27;s the difference between POST and GET?&quot; is a bad question (it absolutely is), but rather that there&#x27;s a better way to find that answer out than ask that question.<p>Here&#x27;s how tech interviews normally go for me.<p>Interviewer: &quot;Hi. Tell me about yourself while I look at your resume for the first time.&quot;<p>Me: &quot;I&#x27;ve been programming since I was 12, went to college, got a degree in X. In the past several years I&#x27;ve worked on Y, which was built using Z with blah blah blah.&quot;<p>Interviewer: &quot;Great, great.

A POST is...&quot;<p>Interviewer: &quot;Great, great. Let&#x27;s do some whiteboard coding. Convert this array into a binary tree.&quot;<p>Me: &quot;function convert_array_to_binary_tree(foo) {...&quot;<p>Interviewer: &quot;Great, great. Well, we&#x27;re all out of time. I&#x27;ll bring in the next person.&quot;<p>Interviewer2: &quot;Hi, tell me about yourself while I look at your resume for the first time.&quot;<p>How it should go:<p>Interviewer: &quot;Hi, I&#x27;m so-and-so. I&#x27;ve been checking out your resume and I saw that on your Github profile, you wrote an application called NaNoWriMoClone. What&#x27;s that?&quot;<p>Me: (excited) &quot;Oh man. So in my free time, I like to write. Every year in November I participate in a contest called NaNoWriMo, which stands for National Novel Writing Month. I like their interface so much that I wanted to be able to use it every day, even if it&#x27;s not during NaNoWriMo. What I did was I started out with a custom MVC framework that I wrote a year ago. Basically, you go to the main page, and you sign in using either FB or Twitter sign-on, which use OAuth to connect. I wrote a custom OAuth implementation, which you probably saw on my profile. I can go into detail about that, if you want. Anyway, so there are two models: users and novels. There&#x27;s a one-to-many relationship where one user can have many novels. As the user writes, they can update the word count on the novel, and the app will calculate progress and how many words need to be written per day.&quot;<p>Interviewer: &quot;Cool! I like to write too and I did NaNoWriMo last year. It was a nice experience, but it was so hard to track words.&quot;<p>Me: &quot;I know! I thought about that, too, which is why I also integrated it with a Google Docs API. What I&#x27;m doing in the Google_Api class is hitting their API with a GET request to get the contents of their novel, then I count the number of words and update their count automatically. That&#x27;s one thing NaNoWriMo doesn&#x27;t do -- you have to input your progress manually. I also want to add a Markdown editor in-app which would send a POST request back to Google Docs and update the novel. So they can write it in the app and store it in Google Docs!&quot;<p>Interviewer: &quot;Awesome. You mentioned you used the Google Docs API. Did you run into any problems with that? If so, how did you get around them?&quot;<p>Me: &quot;The Google Docs API is pretty straightforward, but I wound up having to make several requests to get the data I wanted. For instance, I have to make one GET request to get the list of documents my app has access to, then another GET request to get the actual document I wanted, and then a third GET request to get metadata about the document. It took me awhile to handle exceptions, such as if I was denied access to a specific document, but I finally got that working, and now if something goes wrong, I can notify the user and have them look into the permissions or whether the document actually exists and so on.&quot;<p>Interviewer: &quot;You mentioned you wrote the MVC framework from scratch. Why did you do that rather than use CodeIgniter or Symfony? Did you run into any problems?&quot;<p>Me: &quot;I decided I wanted to learn how MVC worked from the ground up. I had used Symfony in the past, but I wanted something a little less complex. So I started off with...&quot; (and so on)<p>Interviewer: &quot;I see you went to X college and got a degree in Y. That&#x27;s interesting. How did you transition over to programming?&quot;<p>----<p>Anyway, as you can see, the interviewer is getting WAY more out of me in the second example. Not only does he know that I know what MVC means, I&#x27;ve also demonstrated that I know how to use a 3rd party API, which necessitates knowledge of GET/POST requests. Furthermore, with a follow up question like &quot;What problems did you run into?&quot; the interviewer can find out whether I actually wrote it myself or if I went to StackOverflow to copy and paste it.<p>The point isn&#x27;t that &quot;What is the difference between POST and GET?&quot; is a bad question (though it is unquestionably an inefficient question), the point is that you can find out that information in other ways (specifically from code samples!) and get so, so, so much more out of the interview. You will not only be saving both of us time, but the experience should be much more enjoyable for both of us.<p>You&#x27;ll also notice in the second example that I&#x27;ve expressed non-programming aspects about myself. I enjoy writing. Maybe my interviewer enjoys writing (everyone harbors aspirations of writing a book someday, yes?), so now we have something to connect on. I have a non-CS degree. Maybe in a topic the interviewer is interested in. It establishes that I&#x27;m a real, live person and not just a code monkey. It&#x27;s something we could talk about over lunch that&#x27;s not work-related. It&#x27;s a huge plus, imo.<p>Finally, your &quot;lucky enough use something besides git&quot; is irrelevant. You don&#x27;t have to use git to look at my Github profile. My public repositories are public, and you can view the code willy nilly without even signing up for Github. You could just as easily substitute SVN or Mercurial or whatever.<p>This is why articles like OPs frustrate me so much. They pile on with the simple questions that get a single answer and don&#x27;t really teach you how to interview more effectively.",1382028327

And sure, they can&#x27;t prosecute on something that circumstantial...but that&#x27;s not the point...they just have to keep limiting their scope and keep questioning (the suspect, the suspect&#x27;s associates) until they find the smoking gun.<p>I think too many tech people (though not Bruce) think that this process fails alone on the technology...i.e. if they can&#x27;t break 4096-bit encryption, then you&#x27;re good to go. But they don&#x27;t have to break the security technology, just the person.<p>This should be pretty clear from the story of Silk Road&#x27;s takedown, which was operated by someone who was more technically savvy than most of DeadDrop&#x27;s audience:<p><a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/10/how-the-feds-took-down-the-dread-pirate-roberts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/10/how-the-feds-took...</a><p>The Feds didn&#x27;t get their initial lead by using sophisticated NSA wiretapping.

A subpoena to WordPress Revealed that the blog had been set up on January 23, only four days before the Altoid post. If this wasn&#x27;t the first mention of Silk Road, it was certainly one of them. Altoid became a person of interest, but who was he? Further research revealed that Altoid had been posting on a board called Bitcoin Talkfurther suggesting a possible link to the Silk Road, which operated on Bitcoin. A key break came when the agent found an October 11, 2011 post by Altoid, looking for an &quot;IT pro in the Bitcoin community&quot; and directing all inquiries to &quot;rossulbricht at gmail dot com.&quot;</i><p>Protecting against this kind of info-leaking <i>before</i> using the app is outside of DeadDrop&#x27;s purview of course...but that&#x27;s kind of the problem.

Here&#x27;s a random smattering of concrete, technological examples:<p>* KDE upstreamed tons and tons of little widget features from its kdeui library into Qt, e.g. more complete keyboard navigation and title support for QMenu, tab bar hiding for QTabBar, default vs. active shortcuts in QAction, clear buttons in QLineEdit, URL drops in QComboBox, place holder texts in QTextEdit, ... there are several dozen improvements to widgets, I don&#x27;t know where to stop. KPrintDialog features in QPrintDialog is pretty big. QColorDialog, QInputDialog, ...<p>* KDE upstreamed lots of things it used to do via KGlobalSettings and KStyle into QStyle and Qt&#x27;s platform plugin system, which means pure-Qt QWidget apps now integrate a lot better with KDE and potentially other target platforms.<p>* KDE upstreamed its KStandardDirs APIs by adding and extending QStandardPaths, which allows applications authors to more easily deal in standard locations on various desktop platforms.<p>* KDE upstreamed lots of work on Qt&#x27;s MIME type system.<p>* KDE upstreamed its X11 session management handling.<p>* Lots of stuff in QDesktopServices, QCommandLineParser, QLocale ...<p>So ok, that should put the &quot;no improvements&quot; spiel to rest; you&#x27;re not really aware of what&#x27;s been going on. But even if this wasn&#x27;t so - why would QWidget be bad to use just because it&#x27;s not making huge changes?<p>Let&#x27;s be clear: Qt 5 swapped out the entire backend underneath QWidget by porting everything to QPA, and it <i>just keeps working</i>.

But all too often, we receive these dopamine rushes simply as a consequence of the amount of resources and effort someone (or a group) puts into something.<p>e.g. You can go to Las Vegas, see thousands of people running around topless in gorgeous outfits and be amazed, yet what&#x27;s the actual value to you?<p>I see this ALL too often in art.  People get &quot;amazed&quot; by things that require a great deal of effort/resources (look how many transistors in this CPU!), but this temporary narcosis blinds us to evaluating /whether it&#x27;s a good idea/.  So many art projects are simply the result of an ordinary person commanding extraordinary resources from a corporate entity to construct a large number of instances of a single, mundane object or a single, large-scale version of the object.  In these cases, the art is not in the sculpture, but in the conning to get the resources.  I see budding artists respond to this amazement and trying to get huge funding.<p>Internet bloggers (Cory Doctorow comes to mind) abuse the word &quot;amaze&quot; all the time.

The blotter may have had none in it. Secondly, even if there was some drug, you haven no way of knowing what other chemicals were in that paper, including strychnine, and its effects after being mixed with water, on the drug. Thirdly, I&#x27;m not sure that 24 hours in a fridge is a sufficient method of extraction.<p>But more damaging is that the drug degrades quickly and is very sensitive to its environment. It degrades in the presence of oxygen, heat and light. A common house fridge provides all three- the door is opened at least once a day (to get your dose) letting light in. The container is open to the air which provides oxygen, and while a fridge is cool, it is does not absolutely prevent degradation of the drug due to heat. I&#x27;ve seen storage recommendations for this drug involving sealed, light opaque containers, kept frozen in an icebox and the admonition that this will only preserve it for a few weeks.<p>You provided less protection, significant dilution, questionable extraction, and stored it for <i>months.</i><p>Basically, the conclusion from your research is this: The drug war prevents the kind of exploration of the possible positive effects of such a drug, that could be carried out by a well appointed lab. \n&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>LSD is an incredibly volatile molecule and after months I wouldn&#x27;t expect any to remain.

This way there are still two major parties but a candidate must get support from the lesser parties to succeed. Say I&#x27;m republican and green. Then during the primary I might vote for the republican that was recommended by the green party over other republican primary challengers.

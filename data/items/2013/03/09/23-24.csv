You loop using the built-in loop construct. You do something for each element using the built-in foreach construct.<p>But without even much built-in syntax, much less a universal style guide, every Lisp programmer creates his own favorite language. That's part of the joy of it for an individual project and part of the cost for a group project.",1362873423

Even if you do manage to buy out Atari from the sharks out there that can outbid you, there is a matter of Atari owing a lot of debt, and contracts with other companies and developers to pay them royalties over the names and content used in their video games.<p>What might happen is you buy the right to some classic Atari video game ROMs that you can bundle with an emulator and then sell for the GCW Zero and other platforms.<p>I think more effort should be put into using the money to create 2D video games from scratch that are like but different enough from Classic Atari games that copyright would not be violated. Instead of Asteroids, call it something else like Space Belter (Belter coming from belt as in the asteroid belt, and a belter mines asteroids) and when you shoot asteroids sometimes minerals and crystals will come out you can grab for power ups and stuff. This can power a force shield or enable a hyperspace drive or give you limited guided missiles to shoot down UFOs and aim towards asteroids. You would have to use different graphics than Asteroids or Blasteroids or any other clone uses, and different sounds as well. But you get the idea. Maybe even make an online server where multiple players can team up to shoot the asteroids and mine things.",1362873410

5350012,comment,5349772,5349772,3,0,itsprofitbaron,,,"I actually like that Referly are 'pivoting' (I really don't like the word pivoting mainly because, in terms of startups its also been associated to failure but many of them arent failures) into a content model ala. Medium etc meaning that theyre basically becoming a content network in the sense that Wordpress and even Tumblr are.  Some people may argue that Mediums strength is actually its editor tools but they recently hired Evan Hansen (previously a long-time editor at Wired) [1] which suggests that theyre going to end up as a Content Network.  Anyway, the reason I like it is because, it seemed (from an outsiders perspective anyway) that Referly wanted to be like this initially (user profiles showing the stuff users shared and some posts on there too) although they were lured by the idea of turning links into $ ala. Skimlinks[2], Viglink[3], YieldKit[4] which resulted in a hybrid  which didnt really make sense, in the sense that Publishers (the ones Referly would really make the $$ off) already have their own websites etc that they want to monetize.<p>Its an interesting play that theyre taking but if they roll out a nice new brand (which really needs to be .com as I dont think Refer.ly is the best name for this going forward) then they can definitely win big in this space. Likewise, I dont think this space theyre going into is going to be a winner takes all market as we have already seen there are several winners even within the same verticals in the content space. So if Referly or whatever their new brand will be even end up Second, Third or even Fifth etc then theyll end up with a decent sized company (there has been plenty nine figure exits for content companies) although, maybe Referly can become the first one to achieve that ten figure exit or maybe even IPO.<p>[1] <a href=""https://twitter.com/evanatmedium/status/309802736831041537"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/evanatmedium/status/309802736831041537</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.skimlinks.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skimlinks.com</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.viglink.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.viglink.com</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.yieldkit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yieldkit.com</a>",1362872235

5350008,comment,5349370,5349749,38,0,moxie,,,"What I really want is for everyone to be using secure communication tools all the time.  Not just because it'd obviously be great if everyone were communicating securely day to day, but because in extreme events, people tend to use the tools they already have and are familiar with.<p>For the London riots, that was BlackBerry Messenger.  For the Egypt riots, that was Facebook and Twitter.  Maybe the next explosive event will feature WhatsApp?  So my sense is that for tools to be attractive in moments where security is suddenly of really clear value, they have to first be attractive in moments where security is less clearly of immediate value.<p>You're right that security is always a genuine distinction, but it's perhaps not the most valuable one to most people.  I certainly believe that if you say ""here's an app that you can install on your phone, and it will make everything more secure without you ever having to look at it again or even know it's there,"" then people will install that app.  But that's not what we're saying right now.  I'd love it if people used RedPhone all the time for every call they made, but I know that it's still not perfectly on par or <i>better</i> than a normal phone call, so I know that people will have a hard time putting up with its usability deficiencies if they haven't seen or felt the direct consequences of the NSA warrentless wiretapping program (or whatever) yet.<p>This isn't to say that there aren't plenty of people who find it valuable for their work right now, just that I'd like for us to be setting our sights on the common case and delivering a product that exceeds peoples current expectations.<p>I think we're finally getting to the point with TextSecure where the normal day to day experience is as good or better than the stock Android SMS application, but we should really be chasing WhatsApp or Snapchat or whatever.<p>And totally, good cryptography is extremely important, and I think we should continue to be rigorous there, but I'm not entirely sure how to approach that with people that aren't actually interested in building secure products.  Right now if you search ""secure sms"" in the Android Play Store, the first result is not TextSecure, but 100 results for apps with names like ""extreme SMS locker pro!"" that ""hide"" your SMS messages by doing hand-wavey things.  We might ignore them, but other people aren't -- they have hundreds of thousands of installs.  I have no idea what to do about that.",1362872066

Forget the word ""religion"" in my original post, it was only an example; what I'm alluding to is the set of fundamental assumptions, intuitions, and instincts that affect our perception of and reasoning about the world on an unconscious level; the thought processes that occur before we're consciously aware of them (as demonstrated by fMRI).<p>As one example, study of color perception has shown that children have to shift color processing from the right to the left hemisphere of the brain as they are educated, and that language has an influence on the shades of colors we are able to distinguish with ease.  I'm suggesting that there is a similar fundamental process at work in the brains of people who use computers and the Internet from a young age that makes lifelong users think and feel differently about the Internet in a way that very few older users will understand or experience.  It is difficult to imagine that most older lawmakers who lack this understanding will make effective, future-proof decisions about the Internet.",1362870029

There is an undeniable groundswell around this kind of company right now, and even established companies like Quora are starting to offer much better tools for long-form content. It is going to be very hard, and potentially very rewarding. This new direction isn't just about pivoting away from something that didn't work, it is also about doing something we are much more passionate about.<p>I absolutely agree that our branding is wrong now, and it is likely to change but we haven't decided on a new brand yet. It would have been smoother and more clean PR to annoucne the new brand at the same time as discontinuing rewards, but I didn't want to wait any longer to let users know about the changes that were coming.<p>As to scalability I don't know, maybe it is harder, but it is a fight I am personally much happier to take on. Filling my day with talking to writers, readers, and producing/editing/reviewing/reading content to keep the quality bar high sounds like heaven. I'm so happy not to be carrying this secret around anymore, and to be working on something I love (again, I really did love Referly and it was a thesis I held for 4 years so letting go of it isn't as easy as my email makes it sound).",1362870016

It seems highly unlikely that they have 8x the &quot;social biases unfairly favoring one group&quot;, which is what hackeruser and myself were actually discussing.<p>You also don&#x27;t seem to be using this definition consistently. For example, if I take this comment of yours and substitute this definition in, it makes no sense:<p>&quot;When you find achievement highly correlated with a cultural group, however, it is pretty likely to be a function of <i>probabilistic causes of non-equal representation</i>.

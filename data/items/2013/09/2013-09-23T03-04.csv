The reason for this is I do plan on having other clients beyond the website (iOS - which is practically finished, Android, etc) where just in case their generated Key happens to be injection-ready code, I&#x27;m manipulating it one last time before going in and encrypting/decrypting.<p>- I&#x27;m authenticating the messages based on a server config variable that is an authentication tag like so: SHA256(SERVER_AUTH_TAG + encrypted_data).

The strength of each of the editions of DSM has been reliability  each edition has ensured that clinicians use the same terms in the same ways. <i>The weakness is its lack of validity.</i>&quot;<p>There&#x27;s more. The editor of the previous DSM, DSM-IV, Allen Frances, watched the process that led to DSM-5 with increasing amazement and dismay. He now strongly recommends that professionals avoid the DSM entirely -- he recommends that people not teach it or use it:<p><a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/05/psychiatry-allen-frances-saving-normal-dsm-5-controversy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/05/psychiatry-allen...</a><p>How important is this?

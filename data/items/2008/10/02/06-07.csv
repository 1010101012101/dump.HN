Compulsive viewing.<p>I'm not sure how it exposes anything about the current situation, but it sure underlines what the free-market economy means, how it came about and why it's so important for our lives.<p>One of the underlying messages in the series is that Free markets and Free democracy are intrinsically linked.<p>I'd be really interested to see a 2008 update on this. One that takes into account the new China and Putin's Russia.<p>While China is touched upon in the series - I feel that the author would have many more insights on the impact of China on the rest of the world, today.<p>And Putin's Russia - well here's another piece of fascinating history in the making.<p>One of my favourite sub-plots in the series is the Thatcher story, and the economic reasoning behind the removal of government subsidy for industry.<p>While I was too young to understand it at the time, surely this was one of the greatest feats of leadership in a long time.<p>For something lighthearted and more related to today, see either of the following:\nThe subprime primer: <a href=""http://docs.google.com/TeamPresent?revision=_latest&fs=true&docID=ddv7hj34_03774hsc7&skipauth=true"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.google.com/TeamPresent?revision=_latest&fs=t...</a><p>And from the BBC comedy department,\n'Bird and Fortune' <a href=""http://nz.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJmTCYmo9g"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nz.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJmTCYmo9g</a>",1222930511

321497,comment,321307,321307,0,0,astrec,,,"Griping about jQuery plugins is quite trendy at the moment, which I think can partially be attributed to its audience broading as the lib matures.<p>Most concerns about plugins and the reputation of their authors apply equally to any OSS software - I wonder how many people acquainted themselves with the author of mod_ssl before loading the DSO into their web server?<p>Plugin quality does vary, and some of the more popular plugins have become quite bloated as the authors try to cover each and every use case, but the beauty of the license means you can write your own, or strip the bloat/cruft from a plugin that otherwise meets your needs.<p>jQuery doesn't look pseudo-classical javascript, but that doesn't make it unintelligible gibberish - conversely, I find it a breeze to read and simple, direct and elegant to write.<p>We're spoilt for choice these days: best to sample as many js libs as you can and stick with whatever feels right.",1222929842

Unlike many of the hedge fund managers out there who like to talk a big game based on 1, 2, or 3 year returns, Buffett has been beating the market for over 50 years.  While you are right that he is the first to admit when he makes a mistake, his record is obvious, mistakes and all: <a href=""http://www.usnews.com/usnews/biztech/personalfinance/personal_investing_buffett/timeline/amazing_record.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usnews.com/usnews/biztech/personalfinance/persona...</a><p>For the rest of us, please take his advice and invest in an index fund.

321484,story,,,32,29,rtf,"Ask YC: I just got laid off, and I have some startup dreams.",,"Some background: I graduated college a little over a year ago with an Economics BA. I have the start of a career in game development; I did level design and scripting on a work-for-hire console license, which went six months from contract to ship. (Not a sane schedule.) There was stress, long hours, a month of working weekends, but I'm fine now; and the game shipped.<p>Since then the company hasn't gotten new gigs to support its staffing, so they had to let me go. Both the founders said they'd have me back in a heartbeat; I can probably find a job in gaming again with some time. I'm also working on some open source game tech ( http://gamesc.sourceforge.net/ ) - If I had to point to one technical skill I'm best at, coding is probably it.<p>However, starting a startup intrigues me more than game projects, and this seems like the time to consider it seriously...but although I'm in the Bay Area, I don't have connections in the startup world, and I really want to tap into that experience. Also, being deeply into games, I'd like to stick to that topic for business ideas. I don't know if I could buy into any old web app. Working on any old game is better, but only a little bit. I'm really keen on finding something innovative to do in the sector(business-wise) and a team to do it with; something that's really disruptive. I think it's possible. But I don't think I can do it alone.<p>I guess my question would be: What would be the right steps to take, to meet the kinds of people I want to meet that would work together on this kind of startup? Staying in the industry <i>might</i> be the way to meet the people I need. But I'm not convinced it's the best, or the only option.",1222928530

321482,comment,321337,321337,0,0,drusenko,,,"As much as people seem to think otherwise, we're not giving a free $700B to the financial industry. We're loaning money that needs to be re-payed. Why do we need to loan money? Because credit has shored up and many a company's credit rating has dropped, which makes it very difficult to get credit.<p>This is all caused by a set of bad bets placed on mortgages. The large majority of these businesses are very sound, and there is still a huge amount of underlying value there. You can be quick to point fingers at the wall st trader types for placing bad bets, but everybody was complicit in this, even (surprise surprise) the government, by lowering mortgage requirements.<p>Certain companies just can't go out of business. AIG, for example. AIG is connected to almost every company in the US -- they provide all forms of insurance. If AIG went out of business, all of that insurance would be worthless, and almost every company in the US's credit rating would plummet, thereby rendering their corporate paper (bonds) worthless. There are a lot of reasons for depending on operational debt through bonds, even in the most financially sound companies.<p>We could let other companies fail, but as they do, the market conditions significantly worsen. As that happens, \n- Retirement accounts will be worthless, making retirement difficult or impossible for many Americans\n- You won't be able to get a mortgage to buy a new house\n- Student loans won't be available, making it much more difficult to attend college\n- A very significant amount of jobs will be lost as big corporations go out of business, and small businesses are unable to meet their operational expenses (payroll)<p>Ultimately, that means a very, very rough ride for the average American (on main street, although I hate that term). If you're not going to be affected by this (you're working at a funded startup, or you're a tenured professor, for example), it's very easy to take the ""let the market sort itself out approach"". But the average American will be hit hard, if no action is taken.<p>In that sense, nobody wants to give money to the people who caused the problem. And we're not -- there are provisions (however imperfect) in the bills that restrict executive compensation for participating companies. Ultimately, it's also helpful to remember that this is a loan, and that it's not a net $700B expense. In fact, when the economy stabilizes and credit ratings return to normal, the equity position that the government has received in AIG (80%) and participating companies should be very valuable -- these are sound business, with one black spot (mortgage backed securities).<p>EDIT:\nA couple other points of clarification:<p>- As a matter of fact, the rich pay the majority of taxes (top 1% earners constitute 40% of total income tax, while top 10% earners constitute 70% of total income tax) -- if anything, it's the rich paying for the bailout.<p>- Check out <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=318690"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=318690</a> for explanation on the title of the house bill",1222928393

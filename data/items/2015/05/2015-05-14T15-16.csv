9545880,comment,9543978,9545395,0,0,zamalek,,,"> The original protest to my comment about Einstein&#x27;s arithmetic<p>My protest with that comment about his arithmetic is that it is incorrect.<p>> You are being disingenuous.<p>No I am not. I am pointing out that you bringing up your educational level is <i>completely</i> irrelevant to the argument. Your education about Einstein&#x27;s work has absolutely no bearing on your potential knowledge about his person or arithmetic ability - you are setting yourself up as an authority in a plea to authority. I&#x27;d take his sister, Maria&#x27;s, word about his arithmetic ability over yours - regardless of your degree.<p>Your degree, profession, hobby, articles and so forth (that you keep bringing up out of context) hold absolutely no authority in that original assertion that you made. Being a theoretical physicist does not make you right about everything, even on matters about the physicists who pioneered fields that you are an expert on.<p>It is you who is being disingenuous by attempting to diminish other people&#x27;s intelligence by explaining how you are more intelligent than them by virtue of your talent in physics - I can&#x27;t fathom any other reason why you would bring up that irrelevant information.<p>I never said that you are stupid, I said that you are wrong. If you believe that you are right because you are a physicist then you are most certainly a fool (which is still different from stupid).",1431619189

It doesn&#x27;t just have huge potential in bigger manufactoring processes and places where monitoring and decision making can be automated to a large degree, but also personal value in home automation.<p>I&#x27;m currently writing my thesis which focuses on reactive events, in the sense that devices can subscribe to specific events and they also post their own.<p>For example: the light in the entrance of your house is connected and will transmit the event,<p><pre><code>    {device: &#x27;Light&#x27;, location: &#x27;Entrance&#x27;, value: &#x27;On&#x27;}
</code></pre>
which your thermostat in your living room has subscribed to. It will then receive this event and based on the value, in this instance &#x27;On&#x27;, change the room temperature by either raising or decreasing it.<p>I&#x27;m very fond of automating things on my computer, so bringing stuff like this into the real world, in an easy way is one of the goals. After my thesis is done I will open-source it, and it&#x27;ll hopefully be something that people can actually use.",1431619108

Learning a new language is uncommon enough that I rarely met other people who had spent the same amount of time learning the same language as me. So you end up judging yourself by an internal sense of progress, by the things you can and can&#x27;t do. This is sort of like if you were learning to play the piano and everyone else but a few dabblers were playing at or near the level of Mozart. Also interesting is that language learners are always a master of at least one other language, so you inevitably compare yourself in that way also. It can really skew your expectations.<p>Also a lot of times in language learning is sort of all our nothing.

In fact emotion typically is counterproductive to engineering work. So, when engineers ask for proof that design is worth it, they are asking for a type of first-order proof that they have spent their professional lives moving away from.<p>That said, here is an example of a study that illustrates why design matters:<p><a href=""http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/223150"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/223150</a><p>> It takes less than two-tenths of a second for an online visitor to form a first opinion of your brand once they&#x27;ve perused your company&#x27;s website, according to researchers at the Missouri University of Science and Technology. And it takes just another 2.6 seconds for that viewer&#x27;s eyes to concentrate in a way that reinforces that first impression.<p>....<p>> Study participants were asked to rate sites on the basis of visual appeal and design factors during an average of 20 seconds spent on each of 25 websites. The sections sparking the most interest included:<p>> Logos: Visitors spent about 6.48 seconds focused on this most identifiable portion of a site.<p>This study focuses on the time and direction of attention, but the clear implication is that these items are causing an effect in the opinion of the visitor. The role of visual design is to create the desired effect in the desired visitor. For example a financial management company will want to elicit feelings of trust, safety, wealth, security, etc.<p>Facebook, I would imagine, would like to elicit feelings of belonging, of family and friends, of connecting and even love. But that is just my guess.<p>Such things happen below the conscious mind. That might sound woo-woo to an engineer, but it happens to us all in everyday life.

I thought that somehow the body knows to slow things down when it is in motion. But when you think through it, it is easy. Its all in the reference frames. Imagine yourself going from Earth to Alpha Centauri in a constant velocity. In SR terms, this means you are in motion with respect to earth. Now imagine there is nothing else in the universe except you. Take away Earth, Alpha Centauri, all stars, galaxies, etc. Nothing but infinite empty space. Imagine yourself doing the same movement (I know it is a stretch and I am butchering physics here, since I asked to take away your source and destination, but you can form a mental picture). Now, in SR terms, I cannot say anything about your motion. You are neither moving nor stationary and it is pointless to say anything. But based on old Newtonian model, you can be considered &quot;moving&quot; in this big empty room of Universe (which later became theorized into Ether). When you grasp this and understand that motion is relative, also understand that time is relative. There is no giant universal clock which dictates what time it is for this giant room (which is again what Newton imagined). Einstein simply said there is no such thing (aka special reference frame).

A topology on a set X is a way of defining what points are &quot;close together&quot; in some sense, more precisely it is a collection of subsets of X, called the open sets with respect to the topology. The collection has to contain both the set X and the empty set, any union of sets in the collection and any finite intersection. Continuous maps between topological spaces are then maps f: X -> Y, that have the property that every f^{-1}(U) preimage of an open set U of Y is an open set of X. And homeomorphisms are continuous maps with continuous inverse.<p>Euclidean spaces have a natural topology induced by the standard euclidean norm, whenever you have a notion of distance or metric d: X * X -> R defined on a space X you can speak of the &quot;open balls&quot; with respect to this metric, that is for a fixed point P all points P&#x27;, such that the distance d(P,P&#x27;) < c is smaller than some constant c. Those generate a topology.<p>For some arbitrary topological space X to be locally homeomorphic to R^d, then just means that every point p of X has a open neighborhood, that maps homeomorphically to some open ball in R^d. That is to say it locally &quot;looks like&quot; euclidean space.<p>One usually wants to do differential geometry on manifolds, that is have some notion of first/second/higher order geometry, in other words do all the things one knows and loves from calculus/analysis on manifolds. For that to work one need that coordinate changes are differentiable, that is
given two open neighborhoods U and V of a point p in X and and homeomorphisms f: U -> U&#x27; in R^d and g : V -> V&#x27; in R^d one needs the composition g . f^{-1} to be differentiable.<p>A stochastic manifold is then simply such a (differentiable) manifold together with a density p, that integrates to one $\int_X p = 1$.",1431616721

Others conjecture that it was because he didn&#x27;t originally think that high mathematics was important for physics, so was considered a lazy student.

The source is hard to track reliably if it moves, especially away from the detection devices or rapidly out of range.  Try tracking a broadcast source from a vehicle driving around you in a circle. If it's omnidirectional you'd have to be in the line of sight. If there is interference across the band, selectivity of the RDF recievers is compromised.

Sometimes accounts can be suspended due to false positives in their ToS violation detection algorithms, but there is a good reason this account was banned.<p>Google does not like affiliate marketing via their advertising services. This is because they feel the best user experience is one whereby the user goes directly to the merchant without an intermediary padding out the middle of the process, and/or competing with the genuine advertiser and artificially inflating the number of ads attributed to a single end-merchant.<p>So in a nut shell, if you don't want your account banned, advertise your own unique thing that is of value in and of its own right and can stand alone without any further affiliate links. If you're offering something of value and it indirectly may lead a visitor to an affiliate link, that's ok, but it can't be the point of the ad. Google were burned by this early in the days of Adwords and customers were routinely led down the affiliate path, which caused serious quality issues in the ads they served up, hence the current ToS.",1328892906

3576475,comment,3575868,3576287,37,0,snewman,,,"In principle, of course you are correct. In practice, however, this viewpoint ignores a key fact of modern life.<p>The ToS for most services nowadays are extremely draconian and one-sided. The vast majority of the time, service providers don't bother exercising the rights they've reserved to themselves. If you try to live strictly within the safe zone of the ToS of every service you use, you'll be crippled. You either live a little bit dangerously, or you go home and hide under the bed. When someone does run afoul of Google's wrath (or whatever other service provider), often it's not because they did something unusually bad, it's simply that they had the bad luck to get noticed.<p>Let me use speed limits as an analogy. It's not uncommon (speaking for the U.S.) to find a highway with a posted speed limit of X MPH, and most traffic driving at X+5 or so. A police officer typically won't pull you over for driving X+5 in that situation, but technically you're breaking the law, and if they do pull you over, you'll probably wind up paying the ticket.<p>The situation with common ToS's is that the road is safe for up to 80 MPH, and most people are going 60, but the posted speed limit is 3 MPH. The police (service provider) can, at their whim, nail whoever they like for going 20 times the limit.<p>What's sad about this is that the situation does not incent good behavior, it incents keeping your head down.",1328892865

Economics, for instance. There are a huge number of people who think economies work in this same linear fashion. Or managing large groups of developers.<p>In some systems that are becoming more complex, such as avionics systems for large airplanes, it's getting to the point where the old root cause analysis methodology is still being used although it's getting less and less applicable (I'm speaking specifically of the crash over the ocean of the Air France flight, but there are other examples)<p>Our minds desperately want to live in a world with clear causality. Do X and Y will happen. When the world doesn't live up to our expectations, many times we just get out a bigger hammer.<p>Looking at this problem solely from a philosophical standpoint, it looks like there is a powerful argument in place for tiered systems to have some sort of distributed goal-seeking self-programming (machine learning), especially when dealing with large numbers of identically programmed/configured computers.

The accidental complexity of SOAP versus the more effective REST (leveraging the existing HTTP platform) and the problems that come with the inner platform effect have cost the industry millions (if not more.) I'm sure SOAP had some super smart guys on the team, but it took them years to speak to someone on the HTTP effort earnestly enough to realise they were replicating features of the platform they were building upon.<p>Or take XHTML vs HTML5 vs HTML 5 (the space before the ""5"" is important to the W3C apparently.) Just google for discussions about the rift between the W3C and the WHATWG - to me it smacks of ""geeks"" (and I use that term perjoratively, knowing that I am a geek) not communicating properly.<p>Finally: on spec, on time and on budget software development is far, far from a solved problem.

And they should be, because ultimately as a benevolent and good prof, you want your students to learn the matter and get a good understanding but you cannot or should not expect them to memorize every little detail you ever taught just because your subject is clearly oh-so-important! A good prof has such a concept that spans from his classes, textbooks to the exams.<p>Putting in questions just to frakk with students because you don't like them sharing notes for whatever reason doesn't fit there - because I strongly doubt good notes would miss major points but rather twist a few tiny facts.<p>> <i>This sounds like a great way to sort the students..</i><p>I knew this sentiment would come up and I cannot tell you how deeply I loathe it. Yes, in elementary school this approach is probably a good idea... force students to sit through each class, make them take notes, then check their homework and give them little shiny golden stars to make them happy and then make them write an exam on it. But we are talking university here, this isn't kindergarten - you should be educating and empowering growing adults, you want them to become individuals and that can only mean dropping the retarded elementary-school gold-star mentality because those aren't the people who will accomplish great things later on if you never taught them or gave them any chance to become independent.<p>The exam should check if I have a good understanding of the subject, it should definitely NOT check how I obtained that knowledge. But if I am a lazy and bad prof, I just dish out multi-choice tests and probably you can pass those easier by just regurgitating some facts you learned by heart from copied notes the night before. But this laziness shouldn't be encouraged by trying to limit notes to counter ""learning by heart without understanding"" because it is just a consequence of being a bad and lazy prof who writes horrible exams that can be passed like that, brute-force style.<p>Stop patronizing students, your job is to prepare them for a career and the gold-star mentality won't get you very far in the real world... whoever your customers are, they care about you getting the job done and not much else.",1328891717

3576337,comment,3574576,3575373,3,0,bradleyland,,,"All telephony advancements since the POTS line have been about increases in efficiency and additional features. In my opinion, the balance between quality and efficiency occurred at the point where most calls were routed over TDM based circuits. An ideal call would use something like PRI to the end user and SS7, over TDM circuits (T1, SONET) from end-to-end.<p>These days, an increasing portion of the PSTN is routed over IP networks. Even if you have a POTS line at your home/office, there's a good chance your call will be routed over an IP network if you're calling someone who is not on the same tandem. In many markets, IP reaches all the way to the individual COs that terminate copper to customers.<p>VoIP can work very well, but it requires a well engineered and controlled network with adequate bandwidth.<p>With TDM, you split your switching rate in to individual buckets. With T1, you get 24 buckets. End of story. You can't even try to push a 25th channel on T1. There's no such thing. Contrast this with VoIP.<p>With VoIP, the controls on the number of concurrent transmissions are all software. Channel control and routing are very well separated from the transport layer. You can attempt to stuff 100 G.711 calls on 1.54 mbps of bandwidth. There's nothing implicit about the voice stack that will stop you. The call quality will be non-existent, but you can try it.<p>The crux of the issue with VoIP boils down to one thing: humans are sensitive to conversational delays. We <i>think</i> that echo is unique to VoIP, but it's not. You actually <i>want</i> callers to hear themselves on the handset. If the listening portion of the handset falls completely silent, the caller will probably think that the line has dropped. On a circuit switched phone call, you hear yourself speak, but you hear yourself in almost real-time. Your brain does automatic echo cancellation.<p>It is extraordinarily rare for a circuit switched call to experience one-way latency higher than 100ms. That means 200ms maximum RTT. Your average individual starts to notice the delay at 300ms RTT. This means that your VoIP audio (called media) must transport over a link that has an RTT of less than 300ms, <i>including</i> any buffering. Nominally, you want no more than 100ms of consistent latency to support good quality voice.<p>So, here I go down the rabbit hole, and I know only a little bit about VoIP. I'm not an engineer, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night :)<p>I'll sum it up like this: you could take another step back and say that VoIP sucks because we all keep trying to do it over infrastructure that was never designed for it. VoIP at your home/office requires the cooperation of your carrier to get the IP transport for voice media to the carrier termination point in an expedient manner. It's not enough to put QoS on your LAN and expect voice to work well. The voice packets have to be expedited all the way to the other end, and that requires cooperation on the backhaul.",1328890996

While people who favor expressive languages will feel unduly restrained in the puritanical world of imperatives.<p>If you go back further than that, it gets back to the old science vs art debate. One style treats programming as a science the other treats it as an art. Both are right and both are wrong, because expressing human though is an art but computation theory is a science, what we do is somewhere in the middle.<p>I am personally an artist, therefore I love expressive languages. I see the beauty of languages like JavaScript despite their warts. Where the author sees the above quote about jQuery and sites it as a drawback of JavaScript I see it as one of it's greatest strengths, the fact that developers can express themselves so fully that they can design mini-languages in it, is a testimonial to it's power. Is the world really worse off because jQuery exists. I would say it has contributed quite a bit of usefulness.<p>For me the one big one with JavaScript is the variable scope issue, I cannot for the life of me figure out why they would have designed the languadge to ignore scope blocks when it comes to variables and move that scope up to the function level. There are a lot of small WTF with it, but to me that is the big WTF where they thinking.

That goes back to Business 101: if you sign a contract, be prepared to fulfill the terms of the contract that apply to your behavior, and know what trade-offs are set up by the terms of the contract that apply to the other party's behavior. You don't leave yourself with any legal recourse if the other party follows the contract, you do not follow the contract, and the other party uses one of its remedies (for example cancelling the contract) under the contract terms. Freedom of contract is one of the key ideas that has made the developed world more prosperous and free. You have the right to tell your friends, ""I don't like the contract terms offered by [name of company]"" but there is little use in supposing that a company will operate otherwise than by its most favorable interpretation of the actual words of the written agreement. Read the fine contract before agreeing to it is a general business principle that it is helpful for hackers to learn. (Yes, I am a lawyer.)<p>ADDITION IN RESPONSE TO FIRST REPLY:<p>It is, of course, unusual for most people to read in detail most contracts they agree to. When you buy an airline ticket, you agree to a contract that is in very small print on the ticket itself or on the webpage where you agree to buy the ticket, and much of the small print refers to national laws or international treaties that you probably don't bother to read. But if a particular business sets up terms that are off-putting to customers, a smart competing business may be able to figure out ways to offer better terms (more megabytes for less money, no restrictions on reselling, or whatever fits the transaction) and then advertise those terms to customers to gain market share from the first business. As long as new market entrants can set up their own agreements in a free market, the equilibrium of actual setting and enforcement of contract terms will be expected to provide consumer utility and opportunity for the business to profit. Again, that's freedom of contract. You don't have to do business with any business that offers you terms you actively dislike. If you don't think the terms are perfect or ""fair,"" but the trade-off offered in the terms helps you do what you want to do, you may still agree to the terms.",1328890357

Coming up with and coding it took him less than an hour (from his own mouth which might be embellished). If you look at the full proof of its log(n) running time, you'll realize that splay trees are incredibly complex.<p>Sleator is also an amazing problem solver. He can outcome most of the people commenting on this thread but isn't necessarily the best architect.<p>I believe algo is about problem solving. If you don't understand it, you don't know when to use which tool. Its unecessary if you're writing boilerplate and solved problems with frameworks but when you get to the google/amazon level, you can't just write good code.

Of course, he could be right and it could also be that the X-rays emanating from a TV really do protect you from malaria.  Or it could be that you watch TV indoors and so don't get as many mosquito bites.  So, yes, it could be that Toxo causes increased risk-taking ... OR it could be that risk-takers drive their cars more crazily and do things that cause them to be slightly more likely to get infected!  There can also be a strong socio-economic bias to infection rates and it could be that people from Czech farms are more likely to be infected from eating vegetables from their cat-feces-infested gardens and more likely to be in a car crash driving home wasted after a Polka 10 miles away in the nearest town in a Lada held together with superglue while their affluent city friends take the bus or drive a BMW and eat vegetables from a mass-production farm in the Ukraine.  Etc., etc. \nOn the other hand, the animal data are real (good, controlled experiments) and so it is TEMPTING to believe but the human data are really not good experiments.  WAY too many ""confounding variables"" and no controls.  There is one study with US military recruits that found a very slight increase in the likelihood that if you entered the army Toxo-negative and became Toxo-positive while in the army you were ever so slightly to be discharged with a diagnosis of schizophrenia than someone who stayed Toxo-negative.  But the difference was not statistically significant, in my opinion (predict 13 patients would be discharged with schizophrenia in the Toxo-positive group and saw 15 were - NOT a significant difference).<p>Bottom line, it's crap science and of course he could be right but so could the guy who says the world will end this November...",1328890088

You don't seem to object to your getting a doubtless hefty paycheck resting on huge tuition rates, nor do I recall any quibbles from you to the costs of textbooks. Gods forbid that any student earn a few bucks from his diligent note-taking!</i><p>What I do with MY notes should be nothing but MY business, as simple as that. We are talking university here, people. Students should be MORE than old enough to be able to decide for themselves which way of learning works best for them. I do not need some facetious, bored prof patronizing me on how I want to study and ultimately pass the exams.<p>> <i>campuses are taking new steps to limit what students can do with their class notes</i><p>And this is completely beyond me as well. Even if I could obtain exact 1:1 replicas of all slides used in each lecture plus thorough notes, I still do not get a degree from whatever university they came from and keep in mind that a lot of the HUGE names are releasing course material for free anyway.<p>This whole thing just seems really petty. And don't forget, some students learn a lot better by listening, others learn better by writing it down and others learn best researching on their own and taking thorough, well-structured notes can be a difficult job if you want to follow class and discussions equally well at the same time. Why shouldn't you allow both of those learning types to benefit? Don't we want our students to actually become team-players and independent, autonomous?",1328890076

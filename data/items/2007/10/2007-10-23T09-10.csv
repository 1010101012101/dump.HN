I go to amazon.com mainly for the reviews.<p>This sort of thing reminds me of just how <i>trivial</i> the reasons for using, or not using, a website are. When froogle renamed itself to google.com/products, I pretty much stopped using it. Why? Because when I do a product lookup, I want it as <i>fast</i> as possible. That's the most important thing.<p>...notice that the ""F"" and ""R"" in ""FROOGLE"" are both on the left side of the keyboard. Thus, I could type ""FR"" with my left hand and use the mouse to select ""froogle.com"" in firefox's dropdown in the address box. Can't do that with google.com/products. ",1193132817

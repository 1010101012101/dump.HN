As time went on, I found I could be much more effective by leading a team (and then a company) where other people would write the code.  When you're writing in a high-level language, you've got a compiler that is generating machine instructions based on your high-level code.  When you are writing ""managed code"" in the .NET Framework, there's an additional layer of abstraction-- you are writing (for example) C#, which gets compiled into IL, which gets JIT compiled into you've got a compiler writing Intermediate Language code which is then compiled into machine instructions.  Becoming an architect (or product manager, etc.) is adding additional layers of abstraction (and power).  Your ideas are still getting transformed into machine instructions-- there's just a few more steps along the way.",1209747351

Say it's 1/3rd for the sake of argument.  That creates a post-money valuation of $13m.  Which means that a $20m buyout (once the lawyers get their slice) is, what-- a 1.5x return on investment?  The only way an investor would approve that is if the company was tanking (Xobni isn't-- they are buried in good press).<p>Outlook (and email) is the #1 technology time-sink on the planet (RescueTime has the data to prove it-- someday we'll publish some interesting stats).<p>If you could walk up to any enterprise and propose to make email 10% more efficient, that's worth a TON of money.",1209744429

I've also re-installed it recently, just in case there were new features which would change my views - not so far.<p>Several people have mentioned the requirement to aggregate across multiple webmail clients - I confess that I'm not affected by this as I consolidate multiple email accounts in one location and avoid the need to check separate email services individually. If operating on multiple webmail clients is common practice, then I confess to having been ignorant of this gap in the market - of course, people could consolidate their email in either Outlook or Gmail.<p>As for search, does Google Desktop search not work on your PC?  It searches both within your email [certainly Outlook and Gmail] and across the filing system, whilst being free. This should go some way to addressing your example of locating conversations.  As for the media attachments, I concede that I've long since stopped using my email inbox as a filing system, saving them off to file directories if they are important enough [Pst files in particular always seem to react badly].",1209744345

The rest in equity index funds, spread between UK, US, Europe, Japan/Pacific. Some of those equities are in retirement funds for the tax advantages, and for the discipline of not being able to spend them any time soon.<p>That seems reasonable for me now, as someone who's young and employed. My future earnings (""human capital"") are likely to be bigger than my current financial assets (because I'm young) and fairly steady and bond-like. As I get older, or if I become self-employed, I would move more of my financial wealth into safer assets (eg long-dated index-linked bonds).",1209744330

First, it gives some people (including myself) peace of mind that without it might otherwise prevent investment in some of these vehicles.  Second, you will probably draw down (or switch into less volatile investments) eventually, and so it ups the probability that when you do you so all will be OK.<p>Of course, it also yields higher returns on average, so it is a win-win really.",1209744195

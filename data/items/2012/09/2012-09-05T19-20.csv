4481157,comment,4480301,4480688,4,0,gwern,,,"> Anyone at PwC will instantly know if this is true or not. My guess is that the specifics will check out (why else include them?) and give credibility to the claim.<p>These specifics are either public information or not. If they are public information, they can be checked by a member of the public and confirmed to be wrong or right; but if they are public information, they could have been obtained by such security breaches <i>or</i> by accessing the same public information used to check them. So if they are public information, they do not prove anything.<p>If they are private information, then perhaps only PwC/PwC-employees can verify; presumably some of them will. But, if there was no security breach then PwC will deny that there was a security breach, and if there was a security breach, PwC will - like most companies - deny that there was a security breach because there is no possible advantage for them to confirm it. So regardless of whether this private information is accurate, the only party in a position to verify the information is also in a position with powerful incentives to claim that it is false.<p>What is necessary is some sort of trap-door or one-way data: information which is private, but can still somehow be publicly checkable. None of these details seem to be such trap-doors.<p>I figure these details are either public (building plan listing the existence of suite 260; location of PWC offices and having 3 floors all are trivial bits of info) or are made up for the purpose of seeming plausible.",1346875105

There are columns of numbers and rows of numbers.  None of the numbers add up to any of the other numbers.  I got charged 6 regulatory fees in two months.  There are numerous credits and unexplained charges.  (BTW every single ""error"" has been in their favour.)<p>They just sent me a text message saying my last bill was calculated wrong without further explanation.  I'm online only (save the trees etc) and I see it has increased by about 10% without any explanation as to how.  When I call them up, there is an automated system you have to say what you want 4 times to which it will say it doesn't understand 4 times, before letting you talk to a person.  The person doesn't have caller id and will ask the same question the automated system did (eg last 4 of ssn).  After 30 minutes they couldn't even figure out what was going on, and said to call back a day later.  Presumably the hope is that someone else will have to work it out.<p>The call a month ago took 90 minutes.  It took the rep who worked for them 1h15m to work out what the bill was trying to say.  It also turns out that what they show customers and what they show the reps differs.  We had established that the final total was wrong, but she couldn't work out what all the numbers were or why they didn't add up to total, or why the total was more than it should be.  They eventually gave me a credit I think mainly because everyone was just worn down.<p>And then we get back a further month to when I signed up online.  They will not let you select the plan until you pick a SIM card first.  They mail you the SIM card.  They start charging you the moment their systems accept the new account.  This is before the SIM is mailed, before you receive the SIM card in the post (4 days later) and before you actually put it into any device.  The reasoning is that you could call up and provision a different SIM card, and you are somehow supposed to deduce that from being forced to pick one and receive it in the mail.<p>It is like they are trying to have the worst customer service possible.  Or maybe they are hoping to wear customers out with bogus charges and confusion since these shenanigans are only discovered after the initial trial period is over and you are stuck with the contract.<p>My experience with Verizon Wireless about 10 years ago was somewhat similar except nowhere near the same degree (they only screwed up two months of bills, always in their favour, and quicker/easier to resolve).",1346874324

I have invested time and money on hardware, software, practice and exercise. All of which have paid off but the overall effect has been greater than the sum of the parts.<p>On the hardware side, I invested on a quality 27"" screen that is at a good height w.r.t. head position. I use it with my laptop and my desktop computers. I also got myself a nice, more expensive keyboard, although I'm not quite sure it's the one I want to stick with.<p>On software, I invested time on finding an ergonomic keyboard-only user experience. I can live without the mouse but I need the keyboard for programming so the choice was obvious. I have almost completely changed the software (desktop, editor, browser, terminal) I use, but I did it gradually, one software at a time.<p>Regarding practice, I actually spent time practicing typing. I normally use qwerty-fi layout (the least ergonomic of all layouts) but I learned more ergonomic typing with the dvorak layout. I haven't used it before or a lot since, but I spent about a month doing dvorak exercises almost daily and in the end I wrote some boring documents with dvorak.<p>Finally, exercise. I play the guitar, which makes excellent exercise for the muscles in your fingers, palms, wrists and all the way up to the elbow. The bad thing about guitar playing is that it's asymmetric. I don't always play something musical, sometimes it's just geometric patterns when I'm watching the TV. Piano playing must be good too. Practice instensely until you can feel like your muscles have been exercising, and do stretching and mobility exercises in the end and remember to rest afterwards. (I like fast metal guitar so to build up speed and strength I do my exercise drills until my hand hurts like after gym all the way up to my elbow when doing strength training).",1346874136

The author seems perfectly OK with some of Apple's other fairly arbitrary standards because the experience is OK so far.<p>All curation is ""censoring"". Being absolutist here isn't that insightful -- obviously there are degrees of censorship and a significant difference between ""censoring"" political apps and ""censoring"" malware -- but it is an important point to keep in mind.<p>Personally, I believe the answer is to allow side loading, trading a bit of pain (especially for security reasons) to allow determination on your own of what is acceptable to run on your device beyond the curated apps. At that point, the curated app store as a good thing becomes a much stronger argument for me, because everything that particular curator disagrees with is still available somewhere, even if it turns out I almost always agree with the curator.<p>At least (AFAIK) Apple has been less hard on the jailbreakers in the last few years.",1346873425

When 2 dozen little details are organized onto an internal dashboard, your developers' brains can visualize them and load them into working memory in an instant, freeing them to work on harder problems more quickly and with less detail juggling.  This is very freeing and relaxing, and can even help developers see possibilities they couldn't see before.<p>You can't justify tools like this for every $50K Rails-App-in-a-Box, but companies like GitHub and Google certainly can.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/HighNotes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/HighNotes.html</a>",1346872436

Humans learned how to write 5000 years ago, and it took us a very long while until we mastered the art of transmitting information like that. Once we mastered it, however, we started caring about the way we present that information. For no specific reason, but we developed unique typefaces that look beautiful, different, yet transmit the same information.<p>Likewise, we've spent a ton of valuable time graphing and mining data from all over our stack; it's only natural that after that, we care about how we present that data. Like typography, it's hard because it's an arduous hunt for the aesthetics hidden behind information. But this hunt is what makes us human.<p>That's why we design beautiful graphs, just like we'd design a beautiful typeface. Not because we are GitHubbers, nor because we are designers, but because we are humans.<p>Life is too short to stare at ugly graphs.

Calling `getLine1Number()` on a GSM phone will return the MSISDN, <i>but</i> not all carriers store the MSISDN on the SIM (for security reasons), so it will in some cases return null. This is a somewhat moot point, because there are other ways to find mobile numbers!<p>As you point out, this is almost certainly an Android specific implementation, because there's no way to get either the MSISDN or the IMEI through iOS using the public API (if it was to transpire that WhatsApp were using private calls to obtain them then that would be another story entirely).",1346871657

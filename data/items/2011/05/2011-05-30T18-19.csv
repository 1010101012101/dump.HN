My suspicion is that the marginal cost is quite low.<p>All I'm saying is this: You likely can't take the average cost of safely storing one kilo of waste given current levels of waste and calculate the additional cost that results from letting the reactors run a few more years. This is econ 101. I like to use newspapers to explain the concept: The cost of making 10,000 newspapers in nearly the same as the cost of making 20,000 newspapers. This is because nearly all the money that has to be spent is fixed (wages for journalists and staff, buildings and machines, ). The variable costs are very low in comparison (letting the presses run a little longer, additional paper, ink, ).",1306781497

It's about when the program can't continue, you need undo all incomplete state changes and return to a previous state. Really this article is about the lack a transactions in programing languages, and how error conditions cause problems for software with long lived state.<p>The point about PHP is that it successfully does that precisely because the way it's architected. The state is kept the DB server where the transaction problem is solved.<p>When using long lived server processes, things tend to get in invariant states on error conditions unless you are very careful about how you are programming and dealing with state mutation and error condition. As ugly as it seems, PHP style development frees you from that.<p>I like your point about Chrome, it's a great architecture and it's actual quite similar original Apache PHP combo with the process isolation.<p>Anyway user level undo is still an important concept, but orthogonal to creating reliable software systems.",1306780151
2600070,comment,2599647,2599647,2,0,nsfmc,,,"As a general complaint, i feel like most of these ""web/graphic design pattern libraries"" miss the point of christopher alexander's original 'pattern language' idea, which specify cataloging as only one part of actually developing a larger, expressive, design language.<p>Still, the problem with these as actual 'design patterns' is that they're often wedded to specific implementations rather than the tasks they're trying to solve. I.e. ""Endless Scrolling"" (to pick an example) is not a pattern, it's a solution to a larger problem (e.g. user retention, communicating large datasets, immersive experience, &c).<p>The point being that if you're talking about design patterns in terms of the implementation (web forms, 404 page) you're restricting your pattern language to specific solutions rather than understanding what problems you are actually trying to solve (i.e. I WANT TO GIVE YOU MONEY, WHERE DID THIS GO?, respectively).<p>Although these sites often address these problems, they do so as a second level consideration rather than the primary atom of their pattern language, which diminishes their power. This is generally part of the problem with how design patterns are discussed and understood, which is a bummer, because it promotes the perception that they are 'reference catalogs' rather than 'languages for addressing problems.'<p><i>edit: fixed ambiguous language in last sentence</i>",1306780130

OTOH I dont like checked exceptions at all.  Mainly because development teams go overboard with an exception for every type of problem.

Especially in other peoples code where the exceptions are just swallowed leaving behind ""//TODO add logging"".<p>The Either class looks like a reasonable alternative, although I would do it slightly differently.

1) Starting a blog and establishing yourself as an expert. At the very least, at least get some content out there for search engines to crawl.<p>2) Establishing yourself in forums.
This is important because if you just sign up as a new user when the product is done, don't expect anyone to take your pitches seriously. If you got some reputation under your belt though, people will listen.<p>3) Email leads 
You want to start a relationship with people, especially bloggers. Don't talk about selling anything to anyone, or even talk about your idea. Just ask questions, get to know them, and when the time comes, you can either tell them what you did, or say ""Hey, look at this, I just found this out...""<p>4) Brainstorm about network effects.
There's the product but there's the other stuff that helps makes the product more viral. They can include things such as widgets to embed in blogs, etc.<p>5) Get some links to your site.
This is in line with #1. If you start a blog, the links will naturally flow in. This will lessen the time until search engines gives your site more trust. If you can launch your site in 2 steps, do so.. For instance, if there's a section for content(articles, how-to's, etc) and a section for the actual product, launch the content first.",1306780031

The macro system is a full-fledged Turing-complete programming language, not some crippled text-substitution thing kludged onto the side of the assembler.<p>2. You can write loops and conditionals in it without labels, which makes it a little closer to C than to assembly in the language level, in my book.  To me, that makes it <i>more</i> readable, rather than less.<p>3. You can test your assembly-language routines interactively as you write them, as if you were programming in DDT, but without losing the ability to go back to your source code.<p>In the long run, though, these potential advantages lost out to more traditional IBM-punched-card-style assembly languages, and mostly to C.  I don't really understand why.  Maybe because the successful companies already weren't doing their 6502 development self-hosted?",1306778812

You can then go a long way towards proving that nothing in the FSM object's state was trashed. You can also build a test harness that provides good coverage ( up to 100%  ) and documentation of that level of coverage.<p>That's one way to do hi-rel processing in 'C'.... it all makes choice of language less of an issue. And if you have adequate logging of test site installs ( meaning all state transition data is logged ), then you can reproduce 100% of failures in a controlled environment.<p>It's not magic, but somehow, making the error cases 
explicit events has ( on me at least ) the effect of being 
able to reason about them more effectively. It's just another event.",1306778778

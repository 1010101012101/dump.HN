You can google yourself about the 8 forms of vitamin E (4 tocopherols and 4 tocotrienols) and why taking only one is harmful. Also, many supplements mix tocopherols and tocotrienols, which nulls the effect. Same with taking resveratrol with quercetin, which is the most common formulation.",1374400797

It also depends on my state of mind during reading. For instance, I tried couple of times to read &quot;The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;, and I stopped reading after few chapters. Which is very rare, I usually force myself to complete horrible books, but for some reason I couldn&#x27;t read it. I will give it another shot this year.<p>Cheers.",1374400694

If it opression is so intense to make life worthless, then one has a cause dearer than life itself - to fight this opression. This struggle itself is meaningful. Many &#x27;hero&#x27; movies are structured in this way, the &#x27;good guys&#x27; have a cause, usually around defeating some kind of evil, that gives them ultimate purpose.<p>An even more disturbing take on this is that totalitarianism also gives some people a more sinister cause: the oppression itself.

The problem arises from our culture which turns everything doctors say into a holy tautology that dominates public discourse (without actually understanding the matter), to the point where it doesn&#x27;t even matter what scientific research comes up with, because <i>&quot;those scientists never make up their minds anyway&quot;...</i> sigh.<p>It&#x27;s when you realize that even a rudimentary understanding of the scientific process would avoid that kind of misunderstanding, that it puts into perspective how sad our situation is. This is largely thanks to the media and not individual people themselves, but it&#x27;s still quite annoying to say the least.<p>But even without that, if people subsequently understood the role and limitations of doctors, such critical self-research wouldn&#x27;t be so rare anymore anyway. A doctor&#x27;s role is like that of a consulting company with you as the client: you&#x27;re always going to be better suited to understand <i>your</i> problem domain, a doctor will just serve as a guide to make sure everything makes sense and will <i>then</i> help you implement a solution.

6078299,comment,6076875,6077477,9,0,cmsmith,,,"This is an excellent point that people miss when talking about the &#x27;sharing economy&#x27;<p>The difference in price between equivalent quality airBnBs and traditional hotels can be attributed to a few things:<p>1) Difference in demand due to people being more comfortable in anonymous hotels<p>2) Inherent efficiency in &#x27;sharing&#x27;, because the owner was going to own the property whether or not they rent it out.<p>3) Corruption. Unfair zoning and political influence of hotel industry.<p>4) The risk that you mention is priced into hotel rooms, but not into airBnBs.<p>5) External costs. The negative impact on the neighborhood (traffic, noise, damage) caused by high-turnover renters. Hotels pay some of this through extra taxes and regulation, while sharers pay none of it.<p>Now to the extent the price difference is made up of 1,2, and 3, the sharing economy is great. We are moving towards a more efficient marketplace, with lower prices and better quality for everyone.<p>The trouble is, the hotel industry is already pretty competitive. So I would guess that a good amount of the price difference actually resides in 4 and 5, in which case the sharing economy is saving travelers money and taking it out of the pocket of the hosts and local communities.",1374397678

Even professional mathematicians take a long time to read papers, and they usually won't be able to understand papers outside of their own specific field of math.  I agree with the author that math papers could borrow some ideas from programming - explicitly defining all variables/functions, scoping, etc - but acquainting yourself with the conventions of the field alleviate most of those problems.",1354924714

4889894,comment,4889528,4889528,12,0,dxbydt,,,"Frankly, there are 2 kinds of programmers.<p>People who do this:<p><pre><code>     val result = directProduct(cyclicGroupOfDegree3, finiteAbelianGroupOfDegree7)
</code></pre>
and the second kind, people like me, who do this:<p><pre><code>     // Compute the direct product of 2 cyclic groups
     val z = dP( cg1, cg2 )
</code></pre>
You can easily guess that the 2nd kind are math majors. If my math professor started writing everything out in plain English like the first example, he'd never be able to cover a theorem per class. He'd still be writing the first lemma and the hour would be up.<p>So he resorts to 1-character symbols, precise notations, and terse comments. The idea is - if the reader doesn't grok direct products or cyclic groups, he's fucked anyways, so why bother ? And if he does grok them, why impose cognitive overload by spelling it all out in great detail, just use 1-character symbols and move on.<p>Now both these styles are in direct conflict with each other, and in the Fortran/C/C++ community during the 80s-90s ( when every respectable programmer had a copy of Numerical Recipes on their desk ), you would emulate the 2nd kind.<p>In the 2000s & later, people got rid of their Numerical Recipes & exchanged them for ""14 days to EJB"" and ""Learn Python in 21 days"" and ""Master Ruby in 7 days"" and the like...the community started becoming a lot less math-y and a lot more verbose, and style 1 is back in vogue. Nowadays I get pulled up constantly in code review for using single character names....but I think this too will pass :)",1354924376

If you don't, then sell everything and move in with your parents or friends so that your expenses go down a LOT. If you don't want to do this, you might ask yourself how bad you want to create your own business.<p>Step 2. Spend all day talking to potential customers. Skip online research. Go talk to people. If you don't have something to sell (yet), tell them you are building it and you'd like to show them screenshots. You will suck at this conversation at first, but you will get better.<p>Step 3. Sell, sell, and sell some more. If you have a product, sell to customers. If you don't, sell to investors. Either way, you have to persuade somebody to give you their money.<p>Step 4. Pat yourself on the back because you just did something that most people only talk about.<p>Step 5. Network your ass off and only hang around other entrepreneurs who will support you. JOBers will most likely only knock you down because they envy what you have done (and they dont' have the stones to do).<p>Trent Dyrsmid",1354924297

I have a friend who had a baby and had a gap between the 30 days during which the baby was covered by her health insurance, and the time he was covered by her husband's health insurance from his new job. The gap was the result, if I recall correctly, of her forgetting to timely fill out some paperwork. In that gap, the baby rolled off the changing table and hit his head.

4889785,comment,4889528,4889528,12,0,michaelochurch,,,"Disagree strongly. <i>Math</i> is often the easiest and simplest thing that works for the class of problems it exists to solve.<p>Imagine trying to explain singular value decomposition <i>without</i> the notion of a matrix. No group theory, no well-formed concept of a <i>linear transformation</i> or <i>function</i>. You wouldn't be able to do it. No one even had such ideas before generations of mathematical machinery had been built.<p>I've come to the conclusion that there are lifer languages (/frameworks/technologies) and start-today languages. C, Lisp, Scala, and Haskell are lifer languages. (Now q, for those who've worked in finance, is even more of a hardcore lifer language.) You'll probably find them painful when you start out, but enjoy them a lot more once you really <i>get</i> them. Python, on the other hand, is much more of a start-today language. It's more modular, you can get up to speed quickly, and it's good enough the vast majority of the time. Also a start-today language is Java, with an IDE. PHP is a start-today language. This also applies to tools. Emacs or vi (both being keyboard-driven) are lifer tools. Unix is a lifer tool. IDEs are start-today tools.<p>This isn't about ""better"" or ""worse"". It's about tradeoffs: with a lifer language, it takes at least a few months before you get it (you start off hating it, because it feels weird and limited) but it becomes immensely powerful once you understand it in a deep way. Start-today languages give you a lot of power to start, but then the learning curve flattens. What's better is unclear. The lifer languages have a lot of benefits and depth, but in fast-moving disciplines like web programming I'd prefer that the frameworks be start-today rather than lifer-oriented.<p>Math is an extreme lifer language.",1354922620

4889722,comment,4888331,4889635,3,0,ISL,,,"10 ug acceleration noise has large consequences in displacement error.<p>To get an estimate of the size of the effect, recall that for uniform acceleration, x(t) = 1/2 * a * t^2 . So, for 10 ug = 9.8e-5 m/s^2, this works out to ~600 m in an hour or 360 km in a day.<p>The real effect isn't quite this bad (it's random, not continuous, error), but it illustrates the point. Without an absolute reference for occasional comparison, inertial measurement requires exquisite precision and low-frequency stability in order to be useful for most positioning applications.",1354921563

You haven't learned much differential geometry?<p>Constants vary by 2 pi depending on which definition you use.  Functions might come before or after their arguments.  And, of course, you leave everything that is ""unambiguous"" out of the notation.  (Proving that it truly is unambiguous is sometimes nontrivial for the novice.)  Guessing what notation a particular author is using has been known to be daunting, even for other differential geometers.<p>In grad school I remember sitting down with homework sets and spending longer working out what the question said than I did in solving it once understood.<p>That said, if you tried to actually write everything out explicitly, it would be impossible to read anything.  Compact notation is a necessary evil - without it your brain simply can't think certain things.  With it, it is hard for anyone else to figure out what you just said.",1354921238

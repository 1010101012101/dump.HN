727880,comment,727864,727864,0,0,Edinburger,,,"Nice piece of work. A few observations:
(1) It would be good to be able to link from the site name itself in the results rather than having to hit the W3C/HTML/Trash icons. Also, I would show the icons by default rather than only on hover since otherwise the user might not discover them.
(2) The randomly changing background color on your page is 'cool' but it can be confusing for the user. A few times I thought I'd back-buttoned onto a different site.
(3) This is a very minor point but the vertical lines which contain the 'body' of the homepage look a little 'out' at some zoom levels on FF 3.0.12.<p>HTH.",1248789344

A few things...<p>First, supposedly Mr. Negroponte ""ended the discussion of whether computers belong in children’s hands"".  Umm...Does anyone remember this discussion?  Because I can’t recall a time where people were saying kids shouldn’t have computers.  Who exactly was making that argument?<p>Second, he supposedly ""answered the question of whether inexpensive computers can be useful.""  But the very argument that’s coming up more and more lately is one that points out these computers weren’t terribly useful because they had tons of flaws.  Don’t get me wrong, I believe inexpensive computers can be useful but I don’t believe that was proven by Mr. Negroponte.<p>Finally, note that rather than give actual accomplishments she quotes a projected figure to justify the actions of OLPC.  In my life I’ve learned that people who quote projections as accomplishments are usually the ones who have no actual accomplishments to point to.<p>In the end, this post is nothing more than misplaced hero worship.",1248788794

The site was becoming unusable and unmanageable, and I had to do something about it.<p>I wanted to avoid image captchas, which I consider to be a usability barrier. Instead, I implemented a really simple, three-pass filtering system for comments by anonymous visitors (registered visitors can log in and bypass the spam filtering system entirely). It included the following three steps:<p>1. Ask a very simple grade-school math question using plain text.<p>2. Check comment text against a list of 56 common spam words. (This is actually rather crude: anonymous comments including, say, ""socialism"" trip the filter for ""cialis"").<p>3. Include a hidden form field that is supposed to remain blank.<p>That was in June 2008. Since then, <i>not one spam comment</i> has gotten past the filters.<p>I should note that my site, like Tim Bray's, uses a CMS I developed from scratch (starting about five years ago), so it's likewise not subject to the exploits that target Wordpress or Drupal or the other popular CMSes.",1248788247

3125909,comment,3124241,3125746,4,0,jrockway,,,"Everywhere I've ridden a bike, which includes Chicago, the suburbs, and the Seattle area.<p>Like anything, riding in traffic involves learning and practice.  Read ""Effective Cycling"" to learn the rules and techniques, then try it out.  10,000 hours later (according to Gladwell), you'll be a pro.  (I'm don't have this much practice, but I still feel safe.  I can only think of two dumb mistakes I've made, and I recovered from them without disrupting traffic flow or being injured.)<p>A few techniques that I learned experimentally:<p>1) Don't filter forward unless there is a lane that you can use.  Cyclists seem to want to get to that line when the light is red, but they never think about where they're going to go when the light changes.  I wait behind the cars in the middle of the lane and never have trouble merging into the flow of traffic.  (The cyclists that filter forward are faced with two possibilities.  Stand around like an idiot while all the waiting traffic passes you and you can safely merge back into traffic, or run the light when the other direction gets their yellow, cutting in front of the waiting cars.  Both confuse and annoy other users of the road, and the second one is illegal and dangerous.  Drive your bike like a car.)<p>2) Most rightmost straight-through lanes are, in practice, right turn lanes, so stay out of them.  If you don't, you just annoy people that want the opportunity to turn right on red.  After the light changes, nobody will pass you on the right because the lane is blocked with right-turning cars waiting for pedestrians, and so you have a clear lane as soon as you get into the intersection.  Failing that, nobody will pass you on the right because vehicles simply do not overtake slow-moving vehicles on the right.  Verify this with a look backwards and a polite wave.<p>3) Cyclists never obey stop signs, so drivers are very confused when you are stopped at one.  A hand signal to the person with the right-of-way is appropriate to restore the correct flow at the intersection.",1318956442

Otherwise, it's very hard for someone else (or yourself later) to come along and figure out what the hell is going on. Although that runQ utility looked nice, its output, even when indented, is quite complex. Sure, I can figure it out, but I can't look at it and guess what it's going to do like, say, with quasi-quoting.<p>I mean, it might even be clearer-looking to output strings. Not saying that outputting string programs is good, but it is a good lower limit for how complex the code for your macro system can be in order for it to be useful.",1318956233

LinkedIn, Facebook, etc have you import contacts so you can instantly find your friends/colleagues/etc.  Reddit used multiple accounts to post links themselves.  Create the content or figure out a way to automatically populate when someone registers.<p>-Pre-Launch: Get a bunch of people interested and release it to a large number all at the same time.  Setup a mailing list to collect email addresses and when it reaches whatever threshold you need, launch it.<p>-Launch at an event: depending on what it's used for, there could be an event which makes the most sense to launch at for people to experience it together.  I think it was twitter that was launched at SXSW (my memory could be completely wrong about this).<p>-Launch and fail: probably the most likely outcome if you've not engaged your customers at all.

Before you ask me, I don't have any data about how many multiple accounts there are on FB, but my anecdotal experience suggests that there are many. I also think that it would be very interesting to actually take a survey about that, and about how many people would like to have multiple identities without violating the TOS.<p>About resharing, of course if you use the same real name in both services that would't be different from circles - it would just make it much harder to reshare, but by no way impossible. That's not my wife's use case. But if you use different names, tracing you becomes pretty difficult.",1318954070

The real value in these types of services are Power Users and Business.<p>As someone who considers himself a power user and who runs IT for a business I can tell you Dropbox has been very effective in its marketing.  We use Box.net and my users are constantly pushing for Dropbox because they use it at home and find it preferable.  If Dropbox had the features we probably would have switched by now.<p>Same with Power Users in that word of mouth is likely to influence these people (though again I'd argue features in that the streaming ability of SugarSync is a real advantage for those users).<p>So as crazy as it seems Dropbox is essentially using you for marketing.

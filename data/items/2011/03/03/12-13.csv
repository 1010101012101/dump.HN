My heart goes out to those that have lost Family, Friends, Homes and Businesses. The last week has been a surreal experience for myself and everyone here.<p>It is a case of the haves and the have nots at the moment. There are still 20,000 homes without electricity tonight and 30% of the city remains without water and sewer. It's an incredibly weird and helpless feeling with many suburbs getting back to (relative) normality while other suburbs towards the east have been devastated. Everyone is on edge, each aftershock brings back memories of Tuesdays quake and for a split second everyone wonders if it could be another big one.<p>From my perspective it has been fascinating watching the web and social media play a key role following the disaster. Immediately after the earthquake the news spread fast via twitter as you would expect. Photos and youtube videos of the carnage were being broadcast around the world within minutes.  It has been described as one of the most documented disasters in history. You can look back at the first tweets using google realtime search <a href=""http://goo.gl/40djD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/40djD</a><p>Txt messages and Facebook were the two best ways to immediately check on family and friends, I can't imagine what it would have been like before these services. Knowing that your loved ones are ok within minutes is incredibly relieving.  I could instantly inform my friends from all around the world that I was ok with a quick status update. And for those without internet access, their Friends who had made contact could  post on that persons wall letting everyone know that they were ok.<p>Facebook Groups have been a great tool to inform and mobilise various volunteer groups. Canterbury universities student volunteer army is the best example. Thousands of students were mobilsed through facebook and they have been helping to clear silt away from properties. Silt is a fine sand that bubbles out of the ground as a result of liquefaction.  <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/StudentVolunteerArmy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/StudentVolunteerArmy</a><p>New Zealand developers have also volunteered their support with a number of excellent websites popping up in the days following the quake.<p><a href=""http://www.quakeescape.org.nz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quakeescape.org.nz</a>\n<a href=""http://www.trademe.co.nz/christchurch-earthquake-support"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trademe.co.nz/christchurch-earthquake-support</a>\n<a href=""http://eq.org.nz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eq.org.nz</a>\n<a href=""http://www.google.com/crisisresponse/christchurch_earthquake.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/crisisresponse/christchurch_earthquake...</a><p>Also worth mentioning, a group of New Zealand developers have launched <a href=""http://www.appappeal.co.nz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.appappeal.co.nz</a> to raise funds.

By that time she was in grad school a few hours away. When we married, I moved there and had to find a new job.<p>I knew HTML and got a job doing tech support for cell phones. My employer had no internal web site and I saw that they needed a page to share links to reference sites, so I made a simple HTML page, just dropped onto a shared file server, not even a web server. Then I started adding pages of training material, etc.<p>I had just heard (this was 2007) that CSS could be used for layout - gasp! - so I bought Eric Meyer's CSS: The Definitive Guide and studied during lunch breaks and evenings. I spiffed up the site. Next I got Head First Javascript to add some animated menus. Soon after, somebody told me about jQuery, and eventually I caught onto that.<p>As I added more pages, it sucked to have to copy and paste my common menu, so a friend recommended PHP. I had to set up Apache for that, though, so I used XAMPP. Now I could do includes! But wouldn't it be nice to have some database interaction? I read a PHP book and added that too. Eventually the system was pretty complex, with object-oriented database interactions, permissions controls, AJAX widgets, etc.<p>All this time I was getting advice from my best friend (we were roommates in college), who is a truly awesome coder with famous companies on his resume. And I was discovering that I really enjoyed this stuff and had a knack for it. Also, all this time, I was still doing tech support: I could be knee-deep in a coding problem and get a phone call, and I had to pick it up, and it might take 2 hours.<p>But by the time I left, I had a good enough resume to get a full-time programming job. And I continue to learn.

They looked at whether they'd used cannabis five times or more by T1, or between T1 and T2. And they looked at whether they'd had any ""psychotic symptoms"" -- quite broadly defined, so that ~10% had such symptoms between T2 and T3 -- between between T2 and T3.<p>They excluded from their sample anyone who'd had psychotic symptoms by time T2; that was 23% of their sample! (They wanted to avoid finding people who had, e.g., already had psychological problems and taken cannabis in the hope that that would help.)<p>They also excluded anyone who'd taken cannabis before T1.<p>(The results without those exclusions were similar to the results with them.)<p>They found a substantial increase -- about a factor of 2 -- in incidence of ""psychotic symptoms"" between T2 and T3 among people who used cannabis between T1 and T2. Remember that ""psychotic symptoms"" doesn't mean actually being psychotic.<p>They also looked for evidence of that ""self-medication"" scenario, by looking to see whether people with psychotic symptoms by T2 were more likely to use cannabis between T2 and T3. Apparently not.<p>They found some evidence that using cannabis over a longer period is correlated with (and probably causes, given their findings about self-medication, but that's harder to be sure of) larger risk increases for psychotic symptoms.<p>There are a bunch of caveats; for instance, they're relying on self-reported data for both cannabis use and psychotic symptoms. (They give some reasons for thinking that this doesn't hurt their analysis too much.)<p>I think their investigation would have been improved by introducing an extra delay, and looking at whether cannabis use between T1 and T2 is associated with more psychotic symptoms between T3 and T4.

The answer three years ago was ""to the extent that the number of smartphones in use worldwide is lower than the <i>potential</i> number of smartphones that <i>could</i> be in use if they were more ubiquitous and cheap, Google is losing money, so it is in their best interest to make Google-capable phones as ubiquitous and cheap as possible.""

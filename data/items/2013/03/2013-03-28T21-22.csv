For all titles I've searched (and not always mainstream or US releases), wikipedia has a better summary, a better plot description, more release info, and a better page layout. Perhaps it doesn't list all the production details such as who was the key grip, but you can easily jump to all the major cast and producer/director wiki pages. It just seems more complete and easier to read. Imdb now seems too specialized, like it's for the movie industry itself.",1364507966

5457914,comment,5457289,5457289,5,0,obviouslygreen,,,"Women were being very clearly, intentionally objectified with the ""booth babe"" thing.  Now, rather than something obnoxious and sexually overt, we have something that I'd call far worse in its subtlety: Using women for <i>exactly the same purpose</i> but in a much more approachable, casual, and probably effectively interactive way.<p>How did this happen?  I seriously doubt it's because girls in bikinis stopped being effective.  But when you can't get away with sexualized advertisement without being martyred, you're going to look for similarly effective marketing that won't offend the people throwing the stones, and in my opinion they've done exactly what we should have expected in this situation.<p>I'm not saying it's right or that women shouldn't expect to be treated as equals.  I am saying that the tech community (and several others) have tried and are trying so hard to reject sex and sexuality and any application of it that might possibly offend someone that we're finally making it worse.  Before it was just an obnoxious inability to be comfortable with ourselves.  Now that we've gotten to the point where everyone knows how prudish and hyperconservative we are, they've also figured out how to keep marketing to us effectively without offending our delicate sensibilities.  And we're still upset.<p>It's a shame that so many men have such a hard time conducting themselves well in mixed professional company.  It's also a shame that we are so utterly unable to <i>be men and women</i> without pigeonholing ourselves and harassing each other over it.  It's a sad situation.",1364507538

Status-checking is a human activity.  Here is a key component in this conversation. The author writes: ""When trying to join lots of interesting conversations, I either had to be that asshole who casually drops her credentials, or deal with a few rounds of being told things were complicated engineering stuff.""<p>That is a problem ALL male developers face repeatedly.  It's the problem of getting respect and status.  It's the same as when two dogs meet in a park.  You always have to fight to convince other people you're intelligent.  I have three degrees and 20 years of working experience, yet I still have to compete with others to convince them I deserve the status and respect I do.  Probably many of you who are reading this now will not be convinced.  I am tested daily at my job.  And it's got nothing to do with my gender.  It's how living beings maintain order.  We test each other.  We sniff each other's butts.  We keep track of who knows what they're doing and who is a pretender or out of date.<p>The author suggested that if all the non-skilled ladies were pigeon-holed as sexual objects, the male geeks would be prejudiced into adorning her with the status she deserves.  This assumption is false.  She would still have to compete.  In tech circles and every other field from welding to law to nuclear physics to snowmobiling to kitesurfing, one faces significant social obstacles when meeting strangers to communicate one's experience and status levels.  There is no shortcut (until you're famous).  This is quite simply how human interaction works in competitive environments: people jockey for position.  It's in our DNA throughout all of the mammalian kingdom.  All of the blogs and tweets in the world won't change this.  One notable exception is the ""nice guys"" who afford woman status before they deserve it.  Many women are quite familiar with this behavior (and many of them are frustrated with it, because once they realize they are afforded status they haven't earned, they realize the person is unskilled at determining people's social status or just trying to appeal to their ego).<p>I hope every woman who thinks that the tech world will suddenly somehow deviate from 195 million years of evolution - who thinks that the tech world could possibly ever deviate from 195 million years of evolution - in order to accommodate her unfounded expectations takes this seriously and deeply to heart.  No matter what, you're going to have to fight to convince other people that you know what you're talking about and that's got nothing to do with your gender, it's got to do with the fact that you're in a competitive social situation.  That's they way nature created mammals, and eventually, the human being.  I hope they all recognize this behavior in all of the other situations they take part in: going to the bank, playing on a team, fitting in with a church - all humans of all genders experience this.

There is no benefit in asking a recursive DNS server to make a DNS request for you to overload another DNS server, you could just make that request yourself(or with whatever botnet you're using).<p>The attack works by sending a recursive DNS server a request with a spoofed source IP. Namely, you make the recursive DNS server think your target is making the request. While a typical DNS query consists of a 64byte UDP packet, a reply can be much much lengthier(it can go well over 1KB).<p>So say you have a botnet with a total bandwidth of 1Gb/s. Each request you make(64bytes) will result in, say, 1KB being sent by the DNS server to your target although the server thinks it is sending it to you. That results in a 16x amplification of the amount of data you are sending the target's way. So instead of flooding your target with 1Gb/s of data, you are flooding it with 16Gb/s of DNS replies.<p>The only permanent solution to this problem(though it is discussed elsewhere in this thread why this is impractical) is for all(or almost all) ISPs to have egress filtering. That is, that they would drop all packets sent from their networks with a source IP that is not on their networks. This would make it impossible to fool a recursive DNS server into sending the reply to the wrong IP.<p>Since this is very hard to do(ISPs have zero incentive to do egress filtering, and we can't even locate the ones from whose networks these attacks are originating to shame them into doing it) the pursued solution is the easier one of locating and closing publicly open DNS recursors. This would still allow DNS amplification attacks using authoritative servers, but they would be much more limited in scope.",1364507073

This is why most central banks try to keep the inflation rate above one percent, and in cases where monetary authorities have tried to push it lower (Canada in the mid-1990s) economic growth has suffered and unemployment has gone up.<p>Realistically, if you want to talk about hidden taxes on society, the costs of unemployment trump those of low inflation: in addition to affecting the most vulnerable members of society in a disproportionate way, unemployment makes everyone worse off over time because stagnant economies suffer compound losses to growth potential. This is one reason the US Fed has a dual mandate to both currency stability as well as low unemployment.<p>And just look at the numbers. Over the time period you mention (your stats are actually 1913-2013 not 1933-2013), American GDP grew from 39.1 billion to 56.4 billion in the 1913-1933 period where American was on the gold standard, before soaring to 14.5 trillion afterwards. Even adjusting for inflation and population growth, you have a story where the benefits of growth vastly outweighed the costs of the inflation which played a role in delivering it. And it isn't even as if you don't have inflation under the gold standard either (it is just that currency debasement happens through the private sector -- theft rather than a tax).<p>There is still very much an open question of what policies best keep economies balanced in the ""sweet spot"" between unemployment and high inflation. Unfortunately for goldbugs, while central banks are comparing things like ""inflation targeting"" or ""GDP targeting"" as general approaches, economic history clearly shows that economic growth has been far faster and more stable in the last forty years under fiat systems with independent monetary authorities than we saw in the heyday of the gold standard.

It may be a valid algorithm in Java, but it's the wrong way to do it in Python. Code like this will work, but it will be slow. Depending on the size of ""queries"", you are potentially allocating gobs of memory in two different places for no reason, and then throwing it away without using it. I wouldn't be surprised if the examples in other languages had similar problems.<p>2) The JSON serializer in Django 1.4 uses a method which is known to be very slow, but which is easily portable across different platforms and works with older versions of Python. They no doubt included for easy bundling. In a real application you would probably want to simply use the normal JSON serializer from the standard library (which is many times faster).<p>3) The examples are little more than ""hello world"". I did some benchmark tests with several Python async frameworks, Pypy, and Node.js for an application I was working on. With small JSON objects there wasn't much difference in performance. Once you started using large JSON objects the performance lines for all versions were indistinguishable from each other. The performance bottlenecks were in libraries, and those standard libraries were all written in 'C', so interpreter versus compiler versus JIT made little difference.<p>4) The problem with ""toy"" examples is that in real life there are two performance factors which must be taken into account. Think of as y = mx + b. With a toy example you are probably only measuring ""b"". With most real life applications it's ""m"" that matters. There are often different optimization approaches that are best for varying ratios of ""b"" and ""m"". You have to know your application intimately and benchmark using data which is realistic for that application.<p>Python has a reputation for being ""easy to learn"". However, it is ""easy"" in the sense of being able to hack something together that works without knowing very much. There can be several different ways of doing things and doing it one way versus another way can mean a difference in performance of several orders of magnitude.

I'm told that this doesn't seem to matter much in practice, as the Relooper is quite refined now. However, I'm certainly willing to believe that there are some oddly-shaped CFG's that this will hurt. Perhaps JS will need goto.<p>* asm.js doesn't have 64-bit types. This is unquestionably unfortunate, as it will need 64-bit types to achieve native parity. (Of course, JS needs 64-bit types anywayit's important on the server, for instance.)<p>* asm.js doesn't have SIMD, unlike LLVM which has support for SIMD with its vector types.

An array of ints can be used as a char array, which in turn can be used as a string.  You just have to interface with it at a lower level, probably implementing your own C-style strlen/strtok functions.  It will be more complicated, especially if you need to accommodate unicode, but it is doable.  Granted, there is no advantage to abandoning the built-in string manipulation functions except speed, but you would only use asm.js when speed absolutely matters.<p>At a more fundamental level, when you have access to memory through a stack and/or heap, and can create arrays of ints with which you can do normal arithmetic and load/store operations, you really can do anything.  After all, that is the entirety of what <i>actual</i> assembler code has to work with.  You just have to make your own abstractions.",1364504587

Many apps will have no reason to migrate to asm.js, and for as long as some big and important apps are written in JavaScript, there will be incentive to optimize plain JavaScript.<p>JavaScript and other dynamically-typed languages exist because in many cases they are the best and most convenient way to write apps.  But suppose this weren't true; suppose that in the long-term developers started favoring statically-typed languages for web apps, either because of performance or because of usability (Eclipse-like IDE convenience; hard to provide in a dynamic language).  Is the author saying that we should artificially prop up usage of dynamic languages by taking away some of the inherent performance benefits of static languages?  That doesn't sound like the best way to achieve technical excellence in the long term.<p>In the marketplace of ideas and technologies, let things succeed or fail based on their demonstrated merit, rather than trying to pick winners and losers based on our preconceptions.<p>> Somebody might say that [my proposed bytecode] does not run everywhere. Nope. It does run everywhere: just take JavaScript and write a simple one pass translator from this bytecode to JavaScript.<p>You can think of asm.js as just that; a one-pass translator of an implicitly-defined bytecode to JavaScript.  If you want to view/edit it as a more traditional-looking byte-code, you can easily implement a YourBytecode<->asm.js compiler.  It just so happens that asm.js is a backward-compatible representation, so works more conveniently as the standardized wire encoding.<p>(I have not studied the asm.js spec in detail, but I've seen pcwalton describe it as an alternate encoding of LLVM bitcode, so I suspect that the idea of implementing a YourBytecode<->asm.js compiler is actually reasonable given the asm.js definition).",1364504552

That is a benefit that not every career offers.  I'm sure that babysitting for a certain income bracket is ""expensive"", but I know that if you're not making that much there are government programs that help, and if you are making quite a bit, it shouldn't hurt that bad.<p>I'm not saying that things are exactly the same as when you don't have kids, but it's not nearly as bad as some make it seem.  Being socially well connected with family & friends help too. When we need babysitting, grandparents are more than happy to help.  We tend to attend parties where other parents will be and the babysitting often gets older kids in the party.  I've never appreciated having close community connections as much as I do now before having children.<p>Blanket expensive is not the status quo.  But I must admit, if you're a single parent with little to no family and community support, it can certainly be expensive.<p>Most people I hear complain about how afraid they are of the expense of raising a child are more in my position where it wouldn't affect them that much.  It's more reflective of the fear and negative bias then what the reality is.  Having lots of money on kids is definitely nice though and will make lots of things in life easier for them, but it's not a must.",1364504524

Combined with a JS client library to paper over the differences between the two, developers could just write one set of low-level code and not care which fast-path execution strategy the browser implemented, and the asm.js version, along with whatever polyfill hacks were necessary to make it work, could be served to old browsers to run the same code slowly.<p>This is, I guess, not that different from the OP's suggestion to create a bytecode and define a one-pass transformation of that into JS.",1364504473

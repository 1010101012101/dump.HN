Note the screenshots don't include evidence of Citrix running, or even a web browser. There's no package management. You couldn't install it if you wanted to. As I recall, I never got networking up.

""Try the edge of town"" suggest limited Minecraft-life experience, and probably limited life experience in general.  Had they simply set up a policy of ""every time you harvest a tree, replant two saplings"" there soon would have been a large enough tree farm to satisfy all 50 players, as trees in Minecraft grow quite fast.  Had players built deep mining tunnels and used any of the common mining techniques [0], they'd have had all the cobblestone (and various other ores) they wanted, without stepping on each others' toes.  Instead, they were so short on resources that they felt it necessary, when fleeing their initial city, to salvage <i>torches</i> -- which are quite easy to create in bulk.<p>For comparison, my mostly adult gaming clan runs an invite-only Minecraft server. We've built up a ton of infrastructure -- a five-acre ranch [1], a greenhouse, mushroom farms, tree farms, strip mines, and monster farms, so we have easy access to virtually every type of resource.  Everything is interconnected via rail lines or portals, so material transport is not an issue.  If someone decides they'll need a lot of a particular type of material, we set up a system to allow us to harvest that material in large quantities.  This allows us to build ambitious projects fairly quickly.  This is typical of well-run Minecraft servers.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Tutorials/Mining_Techniques#Methods_2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Tutorials/Mining_Technique...</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://ripminecraft.blogspot.com/2011/04/tomcat-ranch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ripminecraft.blogspot.com/2011/04/tomcat-ranch.html</a>",1311359545

Obviously the primary indication for the technology in its current stage of development, quantifying blood sugar levels, is in and of itself, a large enough market to make this attractive.  But this is early stage.<p>Consider the possibilities for the next stages of development:<p>- Advancing the formulation to obviate the need for a ""tattoo."" The next generation could be a solution simply applied to the skin that would penetrate deeply enough over a short period of time to test blood glucose without the need for a tattoo. The real time, point-of-care diagnostic frontiers, cost reduction, and other factors implied here are phenomenal.<p>- The article mentions glucose, sodium, and oxygen levels in the blood. The ""sensor molecules"" simply bind to the target molecule or ion and change the fluorescence, providing a reading. Think about the applications for other ions, lipids, amino acids, and even proteins and cytokines using antibodies. Molecular binding assays are prevalent across many, if not most, diagnostic assays.  This could have application in such a wide range of indications it boggles the mind.<p>- Combining the testing to assess for multiple diagnoses in the same test. Think of a kind-of multiplex assay (such as an ELISA) in a single unit. iPhone aside (which is an awesome way to do it), think of a single unit that applies 50-100 small droplets of solution on the skin and sends a focused LED for testing each droplet individually (think of a bunch of small capillary straws, instead of the hundreds of needle pricks such as in an allergy test).<p>Glucose for diabetes: check.<p>Sodium for evaluation of electrolyte levels, kidney and adrenal function, cystic fibrosis disease state: check.<p>Bacterial infection (nosocomial infections especially, like MRSA), viral infections, toxin screening, hepatitis, rheumatic disorders, cancer, the list goes on and on...<p>Again, fantastic.",1311359475

Baudot code was invented in 1870 as a 5-bit mode-shifting character set. This, of course, predates data processing with punch cards (1889), alphanumeric data processing (1929), and binary computers (1937-1941). Even after the introduction of ASCII, the smaller Baudot character set remained a common subset available on a wider range of machines. This is seen in C's ""trigraphs"", where ??/, for example, may be substituted for \\ on machines that don't support that character. Even the Apple II+ had a teletype-style keyboard, supporting only the characters found in Baudot code (the Apple IIe keyboard was the first to support all of the 7-bit ASCII characters).",1311358665

It feels like an architectural band-aid""<p>I don't understand this argument.  Even so-called elegant languages like Scheme still have 'repetitious' MOV, JNE, etc instructions under the hood.  Unless you're running on a lisp machine, everything you write executes very repetitiously in machine language under the hood.<p>Why make a distinction between one abstraction and another?  All of them are architectural band-aids, to use your parlance.",1311357702

They gave Rosetta the same treatment in 10.6. It's gone now. All signs point to this being a grace period for Java devs to figure something else out.",1311357644

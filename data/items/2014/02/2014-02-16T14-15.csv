7247763,comment,7247690,7247690,30,0,spellboots,,,"I was forced to use mercurial for a few years at work and I really hated it. Sure it has a better learning curve than git (or did) but I found it to be incredibly frustrating already knowing git.<p>In addition, I found it to be slower, less flexible, and prone to permanent repository corruption - yes, in git you do see repo corruption but because of the cryptographic nature of git objects you know immediately. HG will (did?) happily let you work away at a corrupted repo for weeks until a fresh clone was attempted and the dreaded repo corrupted message killed development for days until the problem was painstakingly manually fixed.<p>This is just personal experience and a lot of it comes down to taste, but IMO if you are already proficient with git there is absolutely nothing about mercurial that is preferable and some considerable downsides I have been subjected to.<p>Disclaimer: This was a few years ago now, perhaps the project is more mature than it was.",1392562735

The context switching is far from instant, and acclimatising to it could be the eye based equivalent of giving yourself a calluses through repeat gentle stabbing with a needle.<p>Additionally, if you spend a good proportion of your waking hours in a device setup for you to focus at infinity, what happens when you take it off and need to focus elsewhere? The muscles won&#x27;t have been exercised and you won&#x27;t be used to using them when looking at objects you judge to be at different distances.<p>This is on top of the classic intro, which would be &quot;welcome to VR - we&#x27;re going to show you 20 new ways to make someone fall over with surprisingly little effort&quot;, and many of those don&#x27;t even need head mounted displays.<p>As far as I could tell AR got a lot of early support largely because using see through displays eliminates most of the problems while preserving the most interesting non-gaming applications (i.e. keyhole surgery overlays on the patient) though the calibration requirements are insane.",1392562280

7247739,comment,7247170,7247361,1,0,exDM69,,,"> It&#x27;s definitely different from Oculus/Valve but I think most people want to be immersed in a world rather than have a very sophisticated and gorgeous board game/D&D experience.<p>This is by no means the only thing CastAR will be able to do - it&#x27;s just what they have concentrated on in their demos. Perhaps because unlike Oculus, they can create an experience where many viewers can share the same scene (or a completely different scene) on the same physical surface.<p>I am particularly interested about CastAR for (flight, etc) simulation. The problem with Oculus is that it completely blocks your view to the real world. When playing flight simulators and other games with lots of controls, you need to see where your fingers are. E.g. playing flight sims with the Oculus, most of the time your hands will be on throttle and stick and everything is fine but when it&#x27;s time to engage the landing gear, you&#x27;ll have to peer under the goggles to find the button for the landing gear.<p>Perhaps the CastAR technology is more suited to things that pop out of the surface (like a board game button) than things that go deep into the surface (like a window). This might make it less suitable for simulation purposes.<p>On the other hand, the playing with the Oculus will inevitably be a solitary gaming experience where the CastAR may be able to preserve the social element in gaming. Of course, solitary and social games are targeted at different audiences.<p>But the best thing about CastAR vs. Oculus is the competition of two different technologies, which will inevitably drive the competition forwards.",1392562110

Furthermore, pure functional code doesn&#x27;t mutate, so invariants can&#x27;t really be broken, unless you meddle with the internal representation, in a way which would confuse the existing codebase to handle lists.<p>So if you pick list as the implementation detail of your team type, then it will essentially be a list, and may be passed as such to list handling functions without issues. It&#x27;ll be up to your code to handle the aftermath if your invariants were somehow broken in the process, which would be the proper thing to do. From the outside though, just like for any type, the implementation details shouldn&#x27;t be exposed. For weakly typed languages, it should be documented to not rely on it.<p>Edit: I was just handling the original question from an functional stand point. Of course nbouscal solution is much more usable and robust. What would probably happen, if you follow an agile methodology, or some similarly incremental process of development, is that you&#x27;d probably start with a list, and as new functionalities would be added, the type would evolve to a tuple or a record including the list. Any function would then have to be updated accordingly. But at least the team type should be made abstract somehow, to hide implementation details.",1392561761

I live in a Missouri zip code with at least 3, maybe 4: most of it is in one city with a base rate added to the state&#x27;s, I live in a part that&#x27;s not in any city, and the city has districts with additional sales taxes where that money goes for improvements to the district, or to pay back ones that were made.  The plot of land on which the building I reside in has some small strips that are in another smaller city; I don&#x27;t think they have their own sales tax, but they could.  We also have the option of being hooked to the first city&#x27;s sewer system (which for historical reasons now boils down to changing two valves and informing the city); that&#x27;s not associated with any special tax, but I know other places use taxing for that, although probably few if any use sales taxes.<p>So it&#x27;s much less an extreme case than you think, and trying to force every Internet retailer to pay the right sales tax would be an absolute nightmare, pretty much requiring them to pay a hefty sum to a 3rd party that has to spend a <i>lot</i> of money to keep track of the multitude of differences.  It would be freaking difficult for such a company to get <i>my</i> rate correct.<p>And of course the state has two or three base rates, at least, perhaps 0 for some stuff, and two rates on food and perhaps essentials of certain sorts and another for everything else.

I can cheerfully spend an hour in a high-movement VR environment now with no ill effects, and I don&#x27;t use my Rift all that often.<p>For some people, it takes strong guts to be willing to put through that practice that it requires. 10 minutes of Oculus Rift (dev prototype) will make me ill for hours.

I&#x27;ve yet to actually sell anything on either platform, but my understanding is that Apple is the seller of apps on the App Store, and makers are simply publishers who effectively get a royalty check. The Google Play store, in contrast, has Google acting as a facilitator but far more falls on the laps of app makers.<p>Apple makes a 30% cut of your app, but while Google takes a 30% cut apparently they give most if not all of this to...oddly enough...telcos? (This is still incredibly fuzzy and I know of no sources, beyond various Google claims that they get just a small administrative charge) That may explain the service difference.<p>Recall that there was a bit of a hoopla because Google shares customer data with app makers, because again the sale is between the app maker and the customer (which is something that very few app buyers expect or understand).<p><a href=""https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/112622?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answ...</a> - &quot;Distribution partners&quot;?",1392561164

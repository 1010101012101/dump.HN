And that test result heavily outweighs any accompanying change to the search result&#x27;s relevancy score.<p>Maybe it did not start out like this, but now that Google is a publicly traded company, and now that they own the market, and now that their revenues are still completely dependent on Ad clicks, things work differently. It&#x27;s not about improving search results, it&#x27;s about improving revenue numbers.<p>If you can&#x27;t see how this business process biases Google&#x27;s algorithm to produce less-relevant search results on page in favor of the Ads having a higher chance of getting viewed and clicked, you have drank the kool-aid.<p>Bing is just as good as Google-search for most people, yet most people have made up their minds about the search engine to use. This market behavior allows Google to not be worried about making algorithmic changes that worsen the results in trade for more revenue ... as the users will keep sticking with them... Because this change has no effect on their userbase numbers (current, and growth #s).<p>Aside from higher CTRs, those changes (that return less relevent search results) will also improve the number of searches done and the number of Ads shown by great margins - as the users will keep at it, performing another search in hopes of getting something relevent back .

From the paper:<p>&quot;The 2317 random editions of new books available on Amazon during the fall of 2012 are charted in Figure 1 below by the decade of the original publication date of the corresponding
title. Both fiction and non-fiction editions are included.

First, public domain books typically have more publishers and more editions per title, since there is no copyright owner to restrain exploitation.

I know it&#x27;s a time sync and pain in the @ss, but it&#x27;s super important that you get hiring right.<p>If you are going to use a recruiter, you need very clear expectations in terms of what skills, experience, requirements you are looking for and stick to them. Also, do everything in as timely of a manner as possible. You should also note, recruiters have best customers also. If you don&#x27;t have very specific and unique requirements, you can assume the &#x27;best&#x27; candidates you&#x27;ll get are the ones better customers have passed on (doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t right for your company, but just an FYI).<p>Lastly, very few recruiters have strong networks they&#x27;ve cultivated.

The whole point of engineering, after all, is to create artifacts that speak for themselves.<p>On the other hand, I think I might know &quot;why we think that&quot;: If hiring is the hardest and most important problem facing most companies, which people keep telling me it is, then it pays to hire with an eye toward further hiring. You might therefore put a premium on hiring people who engage with others via writing and conferences, not because these are necessarily the best widget designers, sprocket debuggers, or gadget platers, but because you expect these people are more likely to go out into the world and be <i>noticed</i> by the great designers, debuggers and platers who you&#x27;ll want to hire next.<p>Obviously this can be overdone, and if you feed this process back on itself you&#x27;ll end up with a one-dimensional clique of a company - in part because blog posts and developer conferences are a very narrow and biased sample of the universe of competent and potentially-competent people. But it shouldn&#x27;t be surprising that companies <i>think</i> that &quot;always be advertising&quot; is a characteristic of a &quot;top engineer&quot;: The problems of hiring are at the top of management&#x27;s mind, and are probably the <i>only</i> thing at the top of <i>upper</i> management&#x27;s mind - in my experience, the CEO could not care less about the glitches in the firewall-configuration system, but she interviews half a dozen candidates every day.

Unfortunately, the way it was said changes the meaning of what was said in a subtle but important way.  But.. that&#x27;s typical scientific reporting, I guess.

6440580,comment,6439680,6439680,8,0,physcab,,,"&quot;I was here in the Valley for the original Bubble, and the situation now is nothing like that was. Back then people were saying there was a &quot;new economy&quot; driven by the Internet, and that productivity was going to go up like a step function, which justified higher p/e ratios for any company that could claim to be a participant. If you had money to invest you felt like you had to have most of it in the stock market, because money parked in bonds would miss out on all this growth that was coming.
Back in the 90s I was sure there was a bubble happening, and was notorious for telling everyone to sell. And yet I remember that even I thought it was dangerous to have money sitting in bonds. I don&#x27;t think that now, and I don&#x27;t think anyone else does either.
What&#x27;s happening now is a lot more localized. A few professional investors are paying higher valuations for startups than they were a few years ago. But the number of participants and the amounts of money moving around are both very small compared to the 90s. Plus the companies are better. In the 90s, it was the dumb leading the dumb: smooth-talking MBAs were raising money from hapless LPs and investing it in startups run by other smooth-talking MBAs. Now it&#x27;s Yuri Milner investing in a company run by Mark Zuckerberg.&quot;<p>-pg

RubySpec is first, not linked from [1] and second, just about completely inaccessible to someone not already familiar with Ruby. It&#x27;s an executable specification, not a language reference manual. It&#x27;s aims, structure, and information architecture are inappropriate for the purposes of a human with questions about the language, ala &quot;what&#x27;s the syntax and semantics for X in Ruby 2.0?&quot; (for X = case, method definition, etc., etc.)<p>We&#x27;re already starting to see third-party sources bitrotting. E.g. eigenclass&#x27; 1.9 pages are now gone.  Without an authoritative source for &quot;What&#x27;s new in 1.9.x?&quot; and later, this bitrot will get worse and make it needlessly painful for folks who still need to move 1.8 code (or brains...) to 1.9/2.0.<p>Part of my point is that the sources directly linked from ruby-lang.org are a mish-mash as well. There&#x27;s virtually nothing authoritative, maintained by ruby-lang.org itself.  The links at [1] are a mix of ok, good, and rather out of date.  ruby-doc.org, not linked from [1] (wat.), is about as good as we&#x27;ve got for a standard reference.  Sadly, it&#x27;s missing the language reference piece and it&#x27;s auto-generated information architecture sucks hard.<p>An example of that last point: hit [2].  What&#x27;s above the fold? A useless list of files. Scroll down and you&#x27;ll eventually get to the filterable lists of core classes and methods. Click on &quot;Array&quot;[3] and we actually get a nice summary doc with examples that walks us through this class.<p>For comparison, we&#x27;ll go to the standard library[4]. Click on &quot;net/http&quot; in the left sidebar[5]. Instead of getting a nice summary page, instead we get an opaque class and method list.  The reader is left to divine which, if any, link might provide some clues about the use and organization of this library. (Hint: it&#x27;s &quot;Net::HTTP&quot;, third from the top on the left.)  If you already know which is the &quot;main&quot; class for this library, then you can usually guess right.<p>It&#x27;s ridiculous for reference material to assume the user is already familiar with it in order to successfully navigate it. Again, other languages&#x27; library references do a much better job w.r.t. navigability.<p>Coda: I don&#x27;t mean to harsh on ruby-doc.org too much; it&#x27;s just a central example in the Ruby world.

6440443,comment,6439172,6439897,73,0,drewcrawford,,,"Disclosure: I very briefly worked for a competitor.<p>A) Drivers reveal a surprising amount of &quot;secret sauce&quot; for a GPU.  The &quot;public-facing&quot; interface to a GPU is something like HLSL or GLSL, but the <i>real</i> interface is some proprietary ISA.  The manufacturers are slowly moving in this area, but the culture of the ISA being proprietary remains.  That leads to things like implementation details getting inserted into ISA docs, or code comments, or driver architecture designs, because they&#x27;re for internal use only anyway.  This philosophy is slowly changing, but it&#x27;s still the case quite a bit.<p>B) There&#x27;s much less difference than you would expect between a $500 gaming GPU and a $2,000 workstation GPU.  It&#x27;s totally plausible that you are one FOSS driver away from a much more expensive GPU.  That is a problem for everybody, including the gamers who want to keep buying $500 GPUs.<p>C) There is a <i>VERY</i> complicated balance of power between OEMs (who control the purse), Intel (who sometimes competes and sometimes complements the video card manufacturers) and Microsoft (for better or for worse, a de facto standards body) and increasingly, new kinds of competitors like PowerVR.  So this is just a hypothetical, but one way it could go down is like this: NVidia decides to fully embrace FOSS.  Microsoft gets pissy and tries to write them out of the standard.  NVidia forced to lower prices to get PC makers to buy.  Apple swoops in and places a huge order of the now-cheap parts.  Intel gets pissy that Apple is shipping too many Nvidia GPUs per Intel GPU, raises Apple&#x27;s CPU pricing to cover the loss.  The price of Macs goes up driving some customers to iPads.  PowerVR&#x27;s royalty fees double, and since they don&#x27;t have to manage any inventory, they are increasingly more attractive to investors than traditional manufacturers like NVidia.  NVidia&#x27;s stock price falls, and some C-level forgoes a vacation in Europe.",1380053679

Hire a lot of kernel hackers<p>2. Try to get the open source driver maintainers to improve integration in a way that is closer to the actual hardware (without giving everything away), and then somehow tie their proprietary driver into that integration code.<p>The letter certainly doesn&#x27;t express interest in improving the capabilities of the nouveau drivers to a point that they can compete with the proprietary drivers in terms of 3d performance, and I think that it would be prudent of the open source driver maintainers to be skeptical of Nvidia&#x27;s motives given the timing and limited nature of the release.",1380053146

Procrastination is avoidance behavior by definition, and I've found that I can always find something to do instead of dealing with the large context switch that comes with hacking.<p>One thing I'm trying is looking for opportunities to leave easy compiler/interpreter errors in my code, so that when I sit down to work I can just run the module I was working on and the compiler will immediately point me to a place to get started.  This is somewhat similar to the advice pg gave in <i>Hackers and Painters</i> about saving up bugs to do when you're tired, but I've found it works really well for remembering where you were.<p>Even if you don't leave a bug on purpose, sometimes having a routine like that can help.  What techniques do you use?",1195430097

81342,comment,81297,81331,0,0,jey,,,"Who cares? IQ isn't a good predictor of much, other than performance on other IQ tests. It's true that there are broad correlations between IQ and paths in life[1], but it's not like our greatest contributors to society have been the ones with the highest IQ. I'm just going to laugh at someone someone comes to me and says ""You should hire me because I scored at +3 sigma on multiple 'intelligence' tests!"".<p>1.

That custom is just an artifact of people having regular office jobs.  It might work better for one person to work 7 days a week but take two hours off each day, or another person to work solidly for two months and then take an entire week off.",1195429120
81340,comment,81297,81297,0,0,amichail,,,"Note that this research is only offensive with regards to highly visible traits such as race and gender.  The reason is that this leads to discrimination (a rational strategy in the absence of other info if the research were to be correct).<p>However, it would not be offensive for scientists to say that people with a certain DNA sequence are more intelligent -- at least not yet since personalized DNA sequencing is not common.<p>So one solution to this problem would be to simply hide race and gender by allowing people to work from home, meet online, etc. There are probably many sorts of businesses where this would be possible.",1195429110

81337,comment,81138,81177,0,0,aston,,,"That's not necessarily true. Google's advertising market is based entirely on matching the impedance between customers and advertisers. People advertising valuable things that customers often click on don't have to pay much to get good placement, meanwhile spammers trying to get an undeserved spot pay a ton for the privilege.<p>Where Facebook differs is that with ads that aren't based on click through rates or some other user action, there's no concern for how users like or dislike what's being advertised. Facebook can focus on making the advertisers happy, and the customers have to bear that inconvenience as their cost of using the site.",1195428442

They are a self-referencing representation. There's no decision involved here at all.</i>""<p>There's a difference here between <i>what you believe</i> and <i>what is true in external reality</i>. (Yes, I know you can spend lots of time debating whether the latter is even a coherent idea, blah blah blah, but all that stuff isn't relevant.) You had to come to a belief about what ""+"", ""="", ""2"", and ""4"" mean. You were not born with this information embedded inside your head! :) This is true regardless of whether the symbols by themselves unambiguously and uniquely pin down the meaning of the expression. Even if a certain symbol sequence has a ""unique unambiguous"" interpretation, you still had to read those symbols and interpret them, and you learned something in the process -- which means you updated your beliefs about the symbols. I agree that the ""real"" interpretation in external reality of these symbols didn't change (if such a thing even exists), but your understanding of the symbols changed.<p>In general, probabilities are subjective and a property of the observer. They describe degrees of belief that the observer has in various propositions, and don't directly have anything to do with external reality. The only way they're connected to external reality is that you make observations in reality and use the gathered information to update the probabilities you assign.  This means the claim that the symbols ""2"", ""4"", ""="", and ""+"" are unambiguous is irrelevant even if it's true.<p>BTW - Thanks for the link on your blog to the NYT graph of the price of gas in constant dollars.",1195428279
81333,comment,81312,81312,0,0,aston,,,"The problem with human computation is that people actually don't really like solving those sorts of boring problems without good incentive. Amazon's answer, of course, is paying them for their work. I like von Ahn's approach better: Figure out a game people will enjoy playing that has the side effect of getting at the solution to your problem. <p>I think the reason more people aren't doing this sort of thing is that game development is in and of itself difficult, and it's even tougher to make a game that gives you useful information on the side. Not to mention it's not clear where there's money to be made.",1195428176

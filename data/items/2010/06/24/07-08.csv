It's that they shed absolutely no light on whether copyright laws are good, bad or indifferent. They imply a moral imperative for copyright laws. This is, to put it mildly, controversial.<p>The theft analogy has no bearing on the question of whether the bad effects of copyright laws outweigh the good.

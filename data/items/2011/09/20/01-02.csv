I'm pretty sure I heard Wael Ghonim say that even he thought it was a slightly daft idea until it actually happened, and then it seemed that they'd found a catalyst for average people to join in a protest.<p>I too hope for some sort of movement that can bridge the artificial divide between Tea Partiers and scruffy leftist kids. Fundamentally, nobody is asking for particularly radical reforms here; so it should be possible to have widespread support.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.demotix.com/news/394309/khaled-said-silent-stand-cairo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.demotix.com/news/394309/khaled-said-silent-stand-...</a>",1316483866

If you were used to Xcode 3, suddenly a lot of functionality is no longer there, or moved, or replaced, or hidden away in a deep recess. To make things worse, a lot of documentation is now hilariously out of date. For example, just about any Core Data guide/sample code/tutorial is not applicable to the brave new world of Xcode 4 (or iOS 4 or OS X 10.7). And there's no indication that any of them will be updated anytime soon -- I speak mostly of Apple's own docs.<p>In other words, there's a lot of pain, currently, surrounding the de facto tool for iOS development, even for seasoned Cocoa programmers.

Does that objectively really matter?) when there are so many real problems that actually exist with iOS development.<p>Thankfully, these problems aren't necessarily permanent -- just as long as Xcode 4 continues to get refined/fixed, and documentation is brought up-to-date (i.e. no more Core Data how-to videos that use Xcode 3 on OS X 10.4!).",1316481513

However, if your parents were religious fundamentalists, you would likely view things in a different light (or, more likely, you'd be just as religious as them).<p>Mine are, and I enjoyed a childhood characterized by a morbid fear of eternal damnation, church twice weekly, private Christian school to ensure that I did not come into contact with peers from less- or non-religious households, and a total abhorrence of modern science and particularly evolution.  However, my parents are intelligent people - it was not their fault they were both born into religious households - and they instilled in me a great love of reading, which backfired for them because, as a science/computer geek, I eventually started in on science books and started to question everything.<p>For me it was like a great window of truth opened on the world and suddenly, everything made sense - and was also so much better than I had been taught.  Of course, that caused no end of problems within my family, in part because I passed along my newfound knowledge to my younger siblings.  Dawkins would have been proud of me as a young adolescent.<p>Most of my friends from those days never read what I read, and they carry on in the same fundamentalist, ""the earth is 6,000 years old and homosexuality is evil"" fantasy land.  And of course, they indoctrinate their children just as thoroughly as they were indoctrinated.  Religion excels at that.<p>Meanwhile, my parents, who I love dearly, are still convinced they are both heading for an eternity burning in hell because they have yet to experience the born-again moment that Protestant Christians pine for.  The problem, I think, is that they are too honest with themselves.  They really just need that single powerful religious moment (aka hallucination) that they would get if they fasted for three days and prayed continually  in a closet, but they haven't had it.  So these dear, sweet, kind and incredibly honest and ethical people are still plagued by the morbid fear I managed to cast off as an adolescent.<p>Just because people are ""good"" doesn't mean that the religious beliefs that have taken over their lives are not damaging to the lives of others and particularly children.  I would take Dawkins' earnest, educated, rational and well-meaning brand of urgent atheism over fundamentalist religion any day.",1316481245

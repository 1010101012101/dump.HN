I think thats why people study it - they don't particularly care about the practicality of their work. Which is ok. Breakthroughs and connections are often unexpected (It's hard to discuss cryptography without understanding it), so you might as well let the smart people do whatever they feel like in academia than declare x,y,z to be the 'real' issues people are facing that should be solved - we have the market/industry for that.<p>Incidentally, I wasted a lot of time thinking about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_problem</a> in high school - I was trying to figure out how to make the A-side and B-side of a mix tape of equal length.",1225277898

On the other hand optimizing your code to run efficiently can be done either using your gut feeling, or by understanding the complexity of your code, to make it run faster, with fewer calls, and optimal buffer usage.  Would that suffice as an answer to your question?",1225277810

The two cannot, as far as I can tell, be even tangentially related, unless you're trying to call .NET some sort of kernel API?<p>Or is this that definition of ""Linux"" that people love these days, which is ""whatever free software operating system distribution I happen to be most annoyed with this week""?",1225277704

Our management disappears and/or does not care about software. We got a young guy with little experience, who has to run the software configuration control business and he gets rather frustrated.<p>So we developer are somehow self-organizing. This is a problem in some cases, but it is also terrific in others.<p>That is the reason why I asked. How do you do it? Your managers don't shut the door and do it for you. They need developers expertise, right?<p>Oh, yes. You may wonder how this can survive? We develop for a scientific project. So our managers are scientists (like the developers). Although we have some very smart developers in the project, management is not among the talents of most scientists.",1225276981
347324,comment,347145,347258,0,0,jlouis,,,"I find complexity theory to be extremely important to CS students. In fact, complexity theory is <i>exactly</i> what differentiates the good programmers from the bad programmers. Not that they use an asymptote in their day-job, but because they have an inherent knowledge of the cost of an algorithm. Now of course, in practice it might be the ""bad"" algorithm that wins because N is small enough. It often is.<p>But the masters inherently <i>know</i> when they need to switch to a more complex algorithm with a better bound. You can't get that without understanding of complexity theory.<p>There are several really interesting problems that people might want an algorithm for which lies in the NP space. Granted, most ${STANDARD} programming is not about the solution to such problems. But then again, it was not the intention that people skilled in theoretical CS should use their time on such problems. In this sense, the theoretical people tend to be far far ahead the ""real world"".",1225276671

I'm just saying that you have to know complexity and algorithm theory to work in the field just as you have to understand the hardware, you might get by most of the time without it but when you don't, if you don't even know where to start, you'll have a mountain to climb rather than a little tree.<p>* However your remark about how this should be abstracted away and people shouldn't have to know it in the same way people don't have to know assembler now, that's not the same thing at all.",1225275771

Anybody who focuses on algorithmic efficiency based off speed is looking at the bark of a tree and failing to recongize that the forest is being cut down.<p>Our problems with CS have become wider and bigger and different. We are having to deal with abstractions of very complex behaviour, and N vs NP, even though it should be understood, is not something that needs to be focused on in-depth in most programming activities today.<p>NP problems are not 'incredibly common' in most programming activities. They are common in most programming fields, just as molecules are common in most human beings, but it does not mean that all human beings have to bio scientists.<p>The reason I am arguing against this N-NP name dropping is that I believe that to properly evolve in computer science, we need to abstract away the details and focus on the bigger picture. For that to happen, we WILL need a generation of programmers that should not need to know this stuff. Just like many new programmers do not know assembler.<p>You're obviously preaching to the choir here, so lots of people will agree with you. But I am convinced that the only path forward we have is by wrapping complexity in aggregates, so that programmers can create even more complex machines. We need to get rid of the details for a certain class of high level programmers, otherwise we will not be able to break out of the existing models we have.",1225274840

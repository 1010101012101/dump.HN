You get what you want from them by giving them your data. Giving them your data is your choice, so if you are uncomfortable with it then you should not have a Jawbone.\n2) What&#x27;s interesting about this article is that it&#x27;s in aggregate, across a statistically significant (so they say) number of people in these areas. They&#x27;re not looking at individual stats, and I would bet would have a hard time tracing it back to a single person/name/etc, if they&#x27;re even allowed to store it that way (not sure, but it would  surprise me if they did).<p>If you don&#x27;t like your data being stored  somewhere, why are you even on HackerNews?

8221970,comment,8219506,8220236,5,0,bunderbunder,,,">  I have seen no data to backup this claim which would override my personal experience.<p>I think that there are two reasons why good data on this is not forthcoming.<p>The first is that for a long time the dominant statically typed languages have been C++, which forfeits most of the potential advantages of static typing by also being weakly typed, and Java, which handles types somewhat better (while by no means being state-of-the-art) but brings its own productivity challenges.<p>The second is, the kinds of enormous long-lived maintained-by-50-full-timers hoary old enterprise applications that I think most fans of static typing have in mind when they say, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t want to maintain that in a dynamic language!&quot; aren&#x27;t often written in dynamic languages.  This in and of itself could be seen as evidence that dynamic languages really are unsuited to the task.<p>Perhaps the more interesting evidence, though, is the tendency of what few larger- and longer-lived dynamic projects there are to become famous for messy code.  This hits at what I think fans of static typing are really talking about - that doing any sort of large-scale refactor in a dynamic language is a terrifyingly error-prone experience.  You need to rely on ever-fallible humans to have written tests that exercise all relevant code paths in order to verify that the refactor was successful in even the most basic terms.  For someone who&#x27;s used to having the compiler quickly, reliably and exhaustively provide the same feedback, having to fall back on the source of all known bugs (programmers) to do the same job leaves one feeling a bit exposed.",1408977969

In exchange for these kickbacks, Ciavarella sentenced children to extended stays in juvenile detention for offenses as minimal as mocking a principal on Myspace, trespassing in a vacant building, and shoplifting DVDs from Wal-mart.[6] More specifically, the crimes charged were: conspiracy to deprive the public of the &quot;intangible right of honest services&quot;, or corruption, and conspiracy to defraud the United States by failing to report income to the Internal Revenue Service.[7] Ciavarella tendered his resignation to Governor Ed Rendell on January 23, 2009, prior to official publication of the charges.[2]<p>The plea agreement[8] called for Ciavarella to serve up to seven years in prison, pay fines and restitution, and accept responsibility for the crimes.[9] However, Ciavarella has denied that there was a connection between the juvenile sentences he rendered and the kickbacks he received.[10][11] In part because of this denial, on July 30, 2009, Judge Edwin M. Kosik of Federal District Court in Scranton, Pennsylvania rejected the plea agreement. He ruled that Ciavarella had continued to deny that there was a ‘quid pro quo’ between his receipt of money and his jailing of juveniles, instead characterizing the money as a &quot;finder’s fee&quot; despite what Judge Kosik felt was the weight of the government&#x27;s evidence.[12] Attorneys for the two judges brought a motion requesting reconsideration of the judge&#x27;s rejection of the plea agreement.[13] The motion was denied on August 24, and Ciavarella and Conahan withdrew their guilty pleas, resulting in the case going to trial.[14]<p>On September 9, 2009, a federal grand jury in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania returned a 48 count indictment against Ciavarella and Conahan,[15] which includes racketeering, fraud, money laundering, extortion, bribery, and federal tax violations. Both judges were arraigned on the charges on September 15, 2009.[16][17] Ciavarella and Conahan entered pleas of not guilty to the 48 count indictment and remained free on one million dollar bail, despite federal prosecutors contentions that their bail should be raised since they now faced the possibility of substantially more prison time and that there was evidence of their attempts to shield assets.[18]<p>On February 18, 2011, a jury in federal court found Ciavarella guilty of racketeering. This charge stemmed from Ciavarella accepting $997,000 in illegal payments from Robert Mericle, the real estate developer of PA Child Care, and attorney Robert Powell, a co-owner of the facility. Ciavarella was also on trial for 38 other counts including accepting numerous payments from Mericle and Powell as well as tax evasion.[19]<p>On August 11, 2011, Ciavarella was sentenced to 28 years in federal prison. On May 24, 2013, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals vacated one count of the indictment against Ciavarella, but upheld all other charges, as well as his sentence.[20] The Third Circuit refused to reconsider on July 24th, 2013. Ciavarella can still appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, but it rarely accepts cases.[21] With good behavior, he could be released in less than 24 years, when he would be 85.[22] Ciavarella, inmate number 15008-067, is serving his sentence at Federal Correctional Institution, Pekin in Pekin, Illinois. His earliest projected release date is December 30, 2035.&quot;<p>From Wikipedia.",1408977339

With a blog roll, the NYTimes, or even the Economist as your guide, you can spend hours skimming from a financial disaster in Argentina, an airline crash in Malaysia, military exercises near the Ukrainian border, and a populist Islamist uprising in Syria, and never come away with anything meaningful except the vaguest notion that those things are happening... somewhere.

Pick a region and do a combination of things to learn about it: read local online publications in the major cities, read some of the local literary figures, dabble with the language(s), pick up a broad history and follow that with exploration of specific topics (a coup, a revolution, a period of cultural revival), learn about the geography (and how that affects the history), then go there.

I find it extremely frustrating that people immediately turn the discussion into retroactive mirroring based on what bad parents have done to their kids, as though it is the natural outcome of this kind of cultivation.<p>Are we so mentally handicapped that it is impossible to see that while the tactic of forcing a child to do something will inevitably lead to failure, early specialization is a real indicator of future success in a field?<p>Here it is laid out all simple like:<p>1: Provide a variety of options and environments for children to demonstrate their abilities (physical, mathematical, grammatical etc...)<p>2: Identify what domains the child is gravitating for work/play<p>3: Identify where within those domains the child is showing a naturally proclivity<p>4: Narrowly tailor instruction and opportunity to cultivate proclivity within that domain<p>Very simple.

With the former, you can design the network so that each directly-connected node has a dedicated channel and you preserve full bandwidth across the spectrum. You also have only a few gateway nodes so your network updates are very few. With the latter you might be using one channel in half duplex to communicate with whatever nodes are closest to you and propagate joins/parts throughout the network. That will have less bandwidth and be slower to communicate as you add nodes, partly due to number of additional hops.<p>If the number of nodes who deal with routing increases, that&#x27;s more nodes that need to be informed of each join/part, so technically it takes longer to update the network. But if the joins/parts are few and the signal is strong, this is a rare event. More nodes can make the whole system faster, or it can make the whole system slower. It depends on the implementation. But there&#x27;s not a constant flow of mesh routing data that multiplies with nodes; that bandwidth used is tiny.",1408976574

Are they keeping up with what&#x27;s being taught or are they struggling? Are they engaged or disruptive? If they&#x27;re disruptive, is it because they&#x27;re struggling to keep up and have disengaged because they&#x27;ve lost hope, or is it because they already understand everything they&#x27;re being taught and are bored?

And I&#x27;ve failed more university course than I should have, for the same reason. I&#x27;ll usually buy textbooks on my own and combine them with online resources to learn on my own time, and this has worked out better than almost any class I&#x27;ve attended.<p>The only exception to that is when professors took special note and allowed me to work differently. I once had a Java professor that instead of working through the weekly goals and quizzes, allowed me to pick a large project to work on over the course of the semester, and he would give me goals from the regular syllabus that I had to meet, but they weren&#x27;t part of any strict schedule like the other students. Things like polymorphism, using an SQL database to store data, etc. I ended up making a tool for managing player stats and notes for a D&D campaign. It was both the most fun, and most informative course I&#x27;d ever taken. However, I understand it is unreasonable to expect a professor to split their time and attention in such a way. Especially if every student wants to pursue their own individual learning style.<p>Courses with a strict schedule are obviously effective for teaching a majority of people. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it works for everybody, or even that it is the most effective method for that majority of people.

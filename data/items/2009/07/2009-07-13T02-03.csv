So it makes sense that you want fewer and more dedicated people.<p>Does Hollywood caricature scientists? Of course. But Hollywood isn't exactly know for its nuance. Business men are always evil (unless the business is failing, in which case the owner is the sympathetic underdog). Politicians are corrupt or incompetent. Is Hollywood to blame for the general indifference to science, I doubt that.<p>To summarize:<p>1. fewer people devote their life to science. I don't think this is a bad thing.<p>2.

700962,comment,700917,700917,0,0,tokenadult,,,"""Crichton had little patience for scientists' complaints about ridiculous sci-fi plots and wild scientist stereotyping. In a 1999 lecture before the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, he countered such gripes with his own perspective on why scientists will probably never be very happy with the products of Hollywood. As Crichton advised, there are at least four important rules of movies that just don't mesh with the real process of research: '(i) Movie characters must be compelled to act. (ii) Movies need villains. (iii) Movie searches are dull. (iv) Movies must move.' Crichton argued that real science, with its long, drawn-out intellectual processes and frequent dead ends, simply can't be reconciled with such exigencies. 'The problems lie with the limitations of film as a visual storytelling medium,' he concluded. 'You aren't going to beat it.'""<p>The other important message of this article is that being smart doesn't prevent people from having mistaken ideas about science. Smart people can fall for plausible but scientifically incorrect statements about topics debated about in politics, because not all people, and not even all smart people, devote much time to examining evidence and making sure that conclusions are supported by evidence.",1247452843

The burden would be too high, and most aggrieved plaintiffs would be unable to recover the harm caused them by the defendant.<p>Plaintiffs have the right to get ""discovery"" to prove their claims <i>because the defendant is usually the only person/company with evidence of the defendant's wrongful acts</i>.<p>A fishing expedition is where the plaintiff cannot articulate any particular type of evidence sought, or how such evidence would be useful/necessary to its case, or how such evidence would result in evidence it could actually use.<p>Example: P sues D for patent infringement, demands in discovery D's head researcher's notes.  Not fishing.
Example 2: Same, except that P demands the CEO's call logs. Fishing, b/c not reasonably related to the patent infringement claim.
Example 3: Same as Ex 2, except that P alleges that the CEO knew about the patent b/c he spoke with a former employee of P before launching D's infringing product.

However, research with any sort of commercial motive will usually not avoid infringement liability.<p>The reason that the ""hundreds"" of companies can get away with it is b/c it isn't worth the cost to the patent holder to pursue them in court -- damages would be minimal, and the chance that a defendant could find something that would overturn the patent (i.e., prior art) is too high a risk if there are at least some companies willing to pay for a license.",1247452360

The fact that it centers on academia does give it a foothold on HN, but it's misleading to suggest that this editorial is more than a borderline Hacker News submission.<p>I wouldn't flag it, but I wouldn't protest if it had gotten flagged off. There are hundreds and hundreds of similar articles, all epsilon from ""Hacker-Newsworthy"", that thankfully don't make it onto HN.",1247450576

It is an older project that went proprietary/closed-source and failed, and we're breathing new life into it starting with the old open source code base. We're about done cleaning it all up, and will start on new features soon.  Completely in C#, and runs on .NET and Mono.  Great project, great people, already members from all over the world.  Check us out on sourceforge: <a href=""https://sourceforge.net/projects/hathi/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sourceforge.net/projects/hathi/</a> Come see some real C# power in action, and join us in the fun! :-)",1247450527

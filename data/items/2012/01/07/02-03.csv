Why would humans do that? Because I believe we will become emotional towards them. We can easily become emotional towards our pets, so it should be even easier with a robot that is even smarter than that. Heck, some people are even somewhat emotional towards their iPhones.<p>The first step towards becoming more emotional will be naming them. I remember reading a couple of years ago about that cleaning robot Roomba, and how people started naming them, and when they were giving them away for repairing, they demanded the same robot back, not a replacement.<p><a href=""http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21102202/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/t/roombas-fill-emotional-vacuum-owners/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21102202/ns/technology_and_scien...</a><p><a href=""http://gizmodo.com/5483750/peoples-emotional-attachment-to-roombas-bodes-well-for-inevitable-sex-robot-industry"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gizmodo.com/5483750/peoples-emotional-attachment-to-r...</a>",1325905061

Although I personally did not experience any significant injury, I can really understand how people can get caught up in pushing their body beyond its means, even through pain.  Despite the fact that teachers often emphasize staying within your ability and focusing on your own practice, the ego often creeps in.  Either between students or even w/i yourself, struggling to further 'perfect' a pose or match what you did last week, is too easy to fall into.<p>I think it is probably similar to other pursuits, whether it be running, weight lifting, or swimming.  It's easy to over do it, and you have to keep your ego in check.<p>Yoga is an amazing practice with a lot of benefits.  The take away that I get from this is to not assume that yoga is always harmless, and to check your ego at the door and really pay attention to your body.  Sometimes easier said than done (especially as I currently nurse a knee injury from a long run last week, which I really knew I shouldn't have done, but badly wanted).",1325904935

Flash is still much slower to write than RAM. They have achieved very high throughput by using mass parallelism but I am sure that each individual cell writes just as slowly as it used to before.<p>I think their innovation is not to replace RAM with flash but to have flash automatically mirror a range of RAM. Thus, using their software you can designate an area of RAM to be mirrored or backed up if you will, and what ever you do with that area of RAM, the fusion IO software will save it and try to have an area of flash that is the exact mirror of your area of RAM.<p>Thus, when you are doing programming you can simply work in RAM without having to worry about saving your data, or writing to a file, etc. The fusion IO will make sure it saves your state so that if you lose power your program can restart from the latest RAM snapshot that was saved in flash.<p>It will probably work, but it seems like something that would be mostly useful in very expensive systems with very high failure resiliency requirements (such as stock exchange systems). If you do not need super high failure resiliency, it might be cheaper to just get one of those motherboards with an on board 12V back up battery (i.e., the ones used by Google).

I met Sonali during Hacker School.<p>I was somewhat aware of Hackruiter and felt they were really smart. They always asked lots of questions and helped me reinforce my understanding of things.<p>Dave and I went out for dinner and he told me the idea was to have a bunch of smart people in a room and see what happens when they all also like coding. I had been working on a few frameworks one the side, Brubeck and DictShield, and thought it'd be great to work with a bunch of other people.<p>We all introduced ourselves at Hacker School's first day and talked about what we intended to work on. All of us had that slight impatience like when we want to get working. We also all had that same curiosity where you want to know what you can learn and share with other people.<p>Everyone had really awesome ideas. Everyone completed lots of awesome ideas. We talked about programming, heard talks from awesome guests, discussed concurrency, functional programming, distributed systems, python, ruby, erlang, c, javascript, node.js, brubeck, zeromq, nginx... the list just keeps going on because the group knew when to talk and share ideas and when to just put the headphones on and hack.<p>I wrote a lot of code for Brubeck and DictShield. I also built a link sharing example site called ListSurf. Then I built it in a more elaborate way and called that Readify. I got a lot of stuff done.<p>I reached out to my friends to find those that had that same values and creative drive as the first group and I'm happy to say a bunch of them went and really enjoyed it.<p>The second batch, batch[1], was just as awesome. Two of my friends from the Dumbo Tech Breakfast were there. A friend from NYCPython was there. New friends came from law school, ran a beef jerky shop, have built music sites, have taught programming classes and managed libraries.<p>I have met some of my favorite people through Hacker School.

Unfortunately, the author does not cite a source for these statements and doesn't appear to be familiar with yoga himself.  (Also, the author strikes me as a little too eager to establish Sandow's influence on the modern world.)  With those caveats in mind:<p><i>Sandow's ideas were taken up enthusiastically [in India after Sandow's visit there.]  There were many who saw physical fitness as the first step on the road to independence and political power.  These included Swami Vivekenanda, the Hindu nationalist leader (and exponent of the three Bs:  beef, biceps, and the Bhagavad-Gita.)</i><p>Later, speaking about the physical practice of yoga that became popular in the west:<p><i>According to some historians, this modern posture-based yoga owes more to Western physical culture (including Sandow's) than it does to Indian tradition.</i><p>Sandow himself made many grandiose statements about the power of his physical exercise program to cure almost any bodily ailment.  No one takes his claims seriously nowadays because he presented them as material facts, but if he had cloaked them in a bunch of mystical bullshit and attributed his ideas to an exotic ancient tradition, he might still have followers today instead of being a mostly forgotten Victorian curiosity.<p>EDIT:  Here's an example of a westerner who did exactly that(quoted from <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/books/review/Mishra-t.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/books/review/Mishra-t.html...</a>):<p><i>As Pierre Bernard, one of the first of many indefatigable charlatans who popularized yoga, or at least its physical-training aspect, hatha yoga, in the United States, put it, The purpose of yoga is to prepare us from getting cheated; to enable us to make better bargains, and to get what we go after! Fabulous sex was high on Bernards menu even in the strait-laced 1910s. Robert Loves entertaining biography, The Great Oom, depicts a bold and successful liar who could tell his gullible disciples with a straight face that oral sex, punishable in 1915 by up to 20 years in prison, was a sacred practice in India and produced orgasms 10 times longer than ordinary intercourse.</i><p>Can I have a Sham-Wow with that?",1325901963

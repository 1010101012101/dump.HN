Sadly, Plus is obviously a better Facebook than it is a Disqus.<p>But either way, it makes the Real Names Only thing more obviously false: you&#x27;re making a general-purpose reusable platform and <i>not</i> a specific social network of your own.  It&#x27;s a &quot;Social Layer&quot;, right?<p>In that case, forcing the users to adhere to a real-names policy instead of providing an official supported path for anonymity or pseudonymity sticks out as trying to push your users into a pattern that they might not find a natural fit for them.  And by &quot;users&quot; I don&#x27;t mean the commenters, I mean the pages to which the comments are attached - if I want to allow anonymous/pseudonymous comments attached to my channel or page or whatever I have a Plus thread associated with, why doesn&#x27;t Google support this?",1384444791

Doesn&#x27;t your Second Time Around Problem conclusively answer _every_ question with &quot;there is no way to know,&quot; though? For example: is there really gravity? Suppose there was a universe with gravity. We let that universe run for its lifetime and record everything that happens. Then we play back that recording in a universe where stuff (matter/energy/etc) is not affected by gravity, but instead behaves according to a recording. The two are identical.<p>As another example: did I really write this comment? Perhaps there was another universe where this comment was written, but _this_ universe is just a second-time-around recording where playback was started right after alternate-me hit post.<p>Anyway: the determinism question folks are talking about is, does the current state of the universe dictate the next state? In your playback universe, the answer is no -- you could edit any &quot;frame&quot; arbitrarily without affecting the frames that follow.",1384442080

Unfortunately, it turns out that &quot;common sense&quot; is not in fact an accurate guide to the behavior of our universe (especially on an atomic scale). This is deeply frustrating, but in the end, the universe doesn&#x27;t care.<p>Specifically, I introduce the idea of a Stern-Gerlach experiment to measure the spin of an electron along specific directions. If you prepare an electron in (say) a &quot;+z&quot; state (which is absolutely unique and unambiguous) and then measure its spin along the perpendicular x-axis, the results are 50/50 (and completely unpredictable).<p>At this point, your intuition is crying out, &quot;We must have just overlooked some distinguishing detail in that initial +z state!&quot; But it turns out that there are experimentally testable predictions of that sort of &quot;hidden information&quot; theory that differ from the predictions of quantum theory (look up &quot;Bell inequalities&quot;), and experiments always come back saying that the quantum description is correct.",1384441541

8721278,comment,8719614,8719614,0,0,alexalex,,,"I* believe that implicit in the curriculum of a doctoral program is the education on how to take on any question or problem and contribute to it. I&#x27;m not a computer scientist but do a lot programming and work with many people with a CS education. Many have an incredible ability to architect a solution to a problem by breaking it down into straightforward operations. A PhD is like that, but for questions and bigger problems. If you want to build something that other people haven&#x27;t built before, or answer a question that nobody else has answered before, a PhD will give you great confidence and experience in doing that. It is incredibly enabling and will change how you approach problems for the rest of your life.<p>However, you also learn why nobody has done it before: because those things take a lot of time. And in a PhD program time is not a limited resource, money is. You will be doing stuff that is a waste of time by any objective measure. You have to be very mindful of the time cost of tasks, work, and your choices, because nobody else is. If you&#x27;re not careful, a very meaningful period of time will have gone by without a lot to show for.<p>My advice for people who ask me about getting a PhD is that it is risky entering a PhD program without certainty in what you want to do. You can go to college and figure out what to do. But in a doctoral program, you are too likely to get lost in the system, have a bad experience, waste too much time, and accrue too much opportunity cost. You will regret it if that happens.<p>_______<p>*PhD in a Physics/Engineering program and research work in neuroscience and medicine.

CPUs aren&#x27;t any good at contended access to memory cells, but they still allow it and it works. If you want your system to scale to many threads you need to break the sharing.<p>Same with databases. The important thing is that it gives you strong consistency when there is contention.

8721259,comment,8718863,8721058,0,0,AlisdairO,,,"> I think you&#x27;ve proved the author&#x27;s point better than he ever could. With serializable isolation, you don&#x27;t have concurrent clients all hitting the same data at the same time...you&#x27;ve got locking/blocking. The two things you&#x27;re trying to put together are mutually exclusive.<p>Not so.  With serialization as implemented by PostgreSQL it&#x27;s perfectly possible for serializable transactions to avoid blocking/rollback on read/write conflicts as long as there&#x27;s some reasonable serialization order.  Some DBs (default config of SQL Server for example) will lock in this situation, but it&#x27;s not a requirement of the model.<p>If you have lots of clients writing to the same data at the same time, yes, you will have lock waits/deadlocks.  At that point, though, unless your updates are trivial (i.e. only ever hitting one lockable unit per logical operation) you&#x27;ve got to deal with what is likely some extremely complicated update logic all by yourself.  And if your updates <i>are</i> trivial, well, you can probably structure your relational DB so that you only ever have lock waits, which is often okay.  Sure, there are situations where it&#x27;s not (highly contended counter, say), but that&#x27;s certainly a small minority of situations.<p>I would argue that if a developer finds typical ACID semantics hard to understand, they almost certainly aren&#x27;t prepared for managing eventual consistency.<p>edit:  If I might add to this, a quote from the Google F1 paper:<p><i>&quot;We also have a lot of experience with eventual consistency systems at Google. In all such systems, we find developers spend a significant fraction of their time building extremely complex and error-prone mechanisms to cope with eventual consistency and handle data that may be out of date. We think this is an unacceptable burden to place on developers and that consistency problems should be solved at the database level. Full transactional consistency is one of the most important properties of F1.&quot;</i>",1418103958

That could be because I have internalized them over many years though.<p>To me, the only sensible isolation level for transactions is serializable. We&#x27;ve had so many consistency issues because developers didn&#x27;t understand when to lock and when not to. Everyone (including me) gets it wrong from time to time.<p>Very careful use of nonlocking selects can be correct and improve concurrency, but across a huge codebase, bugs slip in. If I could turn on a mode where the default is &quot;select ... lock in share mode&quot; but opt into a &quot;select ... nonlocking&quot; I would be eternally grateful. Judicious use of wrappers where we force the user to specify the lock mode has helped curb this trend quite a bit.<p>I&#x27;d still take MVCC with tons of warts over eventual consistency any day of the week.

The user would be given a trial period and then asked to pay.<p>The way I see it, Google, Amazon, Walmart and others would create a small firm of about 10 people. The central processing system could probably handle real traffic with as little as 20 production servers. All tolled, the company would cost probably 10 mill a year. The benefit is that the founding companies would save in transaction fees their contribution to the new monetary commons. If Amazon didn&#x27;t lose 3% to credit card purchases, they would save billions a year. At that point what is 10 mill to keep that going?

Ideologically-driven, e.g. Emacs, GNU, etc.  These tend to have licenses in the copyleft family<p>2.  Commercially-driven, e.g. WebKit, Docker, etc.  These are projects that are strategically important to one or several companies.  They tend to have licenses in the MIT/Apache family<p>3.  &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; or &quot;indie developer&quot;.  While a lot of FOSS is this by volume, what you discover is that by the time projects become popular they have generally evolved into one of the first two types, although they often preserve their creation story as part of the marketing material<p>The problem with charging money for code is that it&#x27;s really a bad deal for the first two types.  The ideology camp doesn&#x27;t want non-commercial licenses because it&#x27;s a &quot;restriction on a field of use&quot; which they have a philosophical objection about that you can google.  In the second camp, the corporate masters derive some kind of strategic advantage from having a popular open-source project and charging money necessarily means the project would be less popular and so of less strategic value.<p>What this necessarily means is that if there&#x27;s any legs to this plan, positioning it as &quot;open source&quot; or to the &quot;open source community&quot; is exactly the wrong approach, because basically all the people who are successful in that community will find it a nonstarter.  Instead you have to hypothesize that there&#x27;s some completely different set of people that can benefit from this system, writing completely new software (or releasing pre-written software that isn&#x27;t currently considered &#x27;open source&#x27;, e.g., proprietary software).  So your positioning needs to be something like &quot;proprietary 2.0&quot; or even &quot;third way&quot; rather than being connected with open source.<p>The real problem with this system is that I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a market on the buying side.

There is no one out there who is actually offended by it. They are all people pushing an agenda.<p>So your argument seems to be that because some people could be offended by it, we shouldn&#x27;t use it, even though the notion that anyone could be offended by it is ridiculous on its face. So what, then, about things like gay pride parades? People can be offended by those, too. According to your argument, we should end that, too. But I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d never advocate for that. You&#x27;d say something like &quot;it&#x27;s their right to be in your face in public&quot;. And of course it is, even though it can offend people. But that same argument defends people who&#x27;d use offensive images in image processing papers, not just ones which are just a target for politically correct assholes. You only care about people being offended if they&#x27;re on <i>your side</i>.<p>Gay pride parades are not bad things, and just the same, a woman posing for Playboy is not a bad thing, and using the cropped image of the face of a woman&#x27;s nude picture is even less offensive than a gay pride parade.

A brief search shows that the term existed long before the modern game industry or any game industry at all. Same goes for &quot;overtime&quot; - the term is even codified in laws. I assure you nobody treats crunch as a normal mode: even people who are forcing unnecessary crunch understand that it&#x27;s something unordinary and often do it just because it is not something normal (to show how good they are at management, to extort a bigger budget, to undermine their political rivals etc).<p>>This may need time and risk that companies that are big enough to be called AAA are not willing to take.<p>Infinity Ward, the original home of $1B+ games, had about 100 people at the time of the split from ATVI and founding Respawn. It&#x27;s about the same size now as well as the Respawn. Media Molecule is just a few dozens. Size does not make a AAA studio.<p>And you don&#x27;t even need to show the best practices right at the AAA level - start small and if it&#x27;s any good people will copy you or, at least, you should be able to grow yourself.<p>>Why two companies you mentioned failed?
>I think we can assume there might be more reasons to that than only being Agile<p>Indeed, it would be naive to blame Agile on destroying multi-million businesses. Agile seems to be just a symptom. It could be that the management sees that the development process is failing and tries to improve it with a well advertised technique, for example. Or that some Agile enthusiast gets too  much power due to the weakened culture. What I was trying to say is that very few AAA studios practice it now and the ones that did in the past are not in the business any more.<p>Also, there is no single AAA development way. For example, Valve&#x27;s practices are very different from Bungie&#x27;s, which are different from the R*, which are different from ATVI&#x27;s COD teams etc.",1418102054

8721137,comment,8719614,8720640,0,0,nycthbris,,,"Thanks for posting this. I don&#x27;t think your experience is uncommon. I have actually worked in two separate academic labs and both of the PIs exhibited some sort of sociopathic behavior (lacked empathy, were extremely self-centered, set forth incredibly unreasonable expectations, etc.). I&#x27;ve tried to convince myself that they simply lack good managerial skills but I think something else is afoot. The academic system and funding climate breeds and selects for these sorts of egotistical investigators. They have to work extremely hard to sell their work to funding agencies that are tightening their belts to begin with against a flood of newly minted PhDs/post-docs that have sunk nearly a decade into their own education just to catch the slightest break. It would make sense then that the only types of people who would follow this carrot-on-a-stick model are those who have thoroughly convinced themselves that they are better than all of the others and should be the recipient of all research funding in their field. Couple this with the fact that nobody gets funding for having humility or admitting that they are wrong and you end up with cut throat competition where salesmanship is valued over the skills of a good scientist or student mentor. Not to mention the bias a bright undergrad gets from a professor on whether or not to pursue graduate study.<p>I&#x27;m not surprised you and I have had negative experiences in academia pursuing an advanced degree. I agree that the politics of it all prevent some of the more unfortunate stories from surfacing because who doesn&#x27;t need another letter of recommendation or reference these days. It&#x27;s not hard to find the culture of exploitation in academia. I&#x27;d really like to know the numbers on what grad school drop outs go on to do. Even more interesting would be how they&#x27;re doing in the mental health department.<p>On a more positive note, I appreciate this article for being a collection of advice for someone considering getting a PhD.

1943087,comment,1942300,1942826,0,0,jacquesm,,,"> 1. Someone has to invest money in creating intellectual property.<p>Most intellectual property takes the form of time invested rather than a monetary investment, and plenty of 'art' as we know it today was just commissioned work ('work for hire') when it was first produced.<p>> At a minimum, the actual creators have to come up with enough money to buy food, shelter, etc., for themselves and perhaps their families while they're doing their creative thing.<p>This is true, but between the stereotypical 'starving artist' and the 'rockstar milionaire' there is a broad range of normalcy that plenty of artists can aspire to. Britney wouldn't be one of those though.<p>> (I won't even get into whether the creators' investment of their time is deserving of compensation; I happen to think it is, but that's not important here.)<p>I think it is, but only if they can sell their product the first time out. The ransom model is an interesting concept that has a direct measurement of perceived value to a group of fans or some other form of market or audience. Once released the product becomes part of the public domain.<p>> 2. The harsh reality is that investors normally will not make such investments unless they have at least a reasonable expectation of getting their money back (purely-altruistic motives being rare).<p>This is true. So the quantity of works will go down, hopefully the quality would go up. That remains to be seen of course, but I'm fairly sure that if it were not for subsidized art we'd see either a larger unemployment level or more people in the workforce (where I live).<p>> 3. If prospective investors know that copiers will quickly destroy the ability to charge money for the fruits of the creative process, they're highly likely to give a thumbs-down to that particular request for their money.<p>No, they may have to find a way to get their moneys worth at the moment of release knowing that if they don't do it then they will never do it. This will reduce the avenues available to them, and will likely result in a lower margin but that does not mean that it won't happen at all. It's a matter of degree, not an absolute.<p>> (As an analogy, imagine the effect that Hugo Chavez's 'nationalization' -- read: confiscation -- of foreign oil companies' interests in Venezuela has had on the willingness of those and other companies to risk any more money there.)<p>Contrary to your view on this in the longer term this may actually benefit Venezuela more than it may hurt it in the shorter term. Oil will likely get more valuable, if Chavez' antics cause Venezuela to be one of the last oil reserves on the American continent that might work out very well for them. I'm cynical enough to suspect that being the people in charge of a valuable resource is probably a health risk because a 'war of liberation' is a viable option when you're sitting on a resource that someone else wants badly.<p>> 4. So while copyright infringement may not seem like stealing, it can have a remarkably similar economic effect.<p>No, it does not have a similar economic effect. Copyright infringement in any particular case could only be shown to have an economic effect if you can actually prove that a sale would have been made and as far as I know that is not possible without visiting alternative universes. You can make a statement to that effect by observing aggregates but you'll never be sure of it.<p>> 5. That's why intellectual property law tries to strike a reasonable balance between the interests of creators and their backers and the interests of the public.<p>Right, which is why Mickey Mouse is still not in the public domain and singing 'happy birthday' is copyright infringement. The interests of the public went out the window as soon as the various organizations realized that copyrights (and patents) are licenses to print money in very large amounts.<p>> EXAMPLE: The U.S. Constitution authorizes Congress to give authors and inventors exclusive rights, but only for limited times.<p>Which have since been extended multiple times, and which now can be assumed to be extended indefinitely until the opposite is proven.<p>> EXAMPLE: Copyright is limited by the fair-use doctrine.<p>Which is further and further eroded.<p>> 6. There's often room for argument about whether any particular aspect of IP law is productive in supporting creativity. For example, it can be legitimately debated whether patents for business methods are a net positive or a net negative.<p>Try to argue they're a net positive, I'm really interested in how that could ever be the case.<p>> 7. But a blanket statement, implying that egregious copyright infringement should never be punished as criminal behavior, is short-sighted.<p>No, I think that's just fine. Criminal laws are supposed to be used to weed out the 'worst' people and to protect the 'good' people. We have civil laws for everything else and this should be a civil matter, after all, you don't have a time machine, you can't visit that other universe, any damage assessment is purely speculative, there is no victim, there are no bodies, there are no crimes.<p>Just some people that <i>may</i> have received less money than they <i>assumed</i> they were going to make.

1943074,comment,1942641,1942641,0,0,partition,,,"While programming in Haskell I also struggled with Haskell's brand of whitespace indentation, even though I come from Python. The key difference in usability between Python's whitespace indentation system and Haskell's indentation system is that you cannot start the lines in a block on the same line as the block.<p>Python's is more restrictive: you must skip a line before starting a multi-line indented block; i.e., this is not legal:<p><pre><code>    if a == b: print ""asdf""\n        print ""a""\n    else:\n        print ""a""\n</code></pre>\nThis lets you decide on a very simple rule for dealing with whitespace indentation: Each new block is started by inserting a carriage return and the proper number of tabs.<p>Not so in Haskell, because you are given the freedom to put the first line of a block in the same line as the block starter:<p><pre><code>    let x = 1\n        y = 2\n\n    do x <- 1\n       y <- 2\n</code></pre>\nNow you need to decide whether to be 3 or 4 spaces in depending on whether it is a let or do block. You cannot use the rule, because the appropriate number of spaces is no longer a multiple of your indentation unit.<p>That's just the simple case, because you are also allowed to put these block starters (let, do, case, etc) at arbitrary points in an expression:<p><pre><code>    f = let x = 1 in let y = x + 2 in\n     y + 1\n</code></pre>\nThis is syntactically correct Haskell; but personally I like the idea of lexical scope being represented by indentation level, which is not reflected here.<p>It becomes very easy to get yourself into situations where you cannot use the Python rule. But you can also impose restrictions on yourself so you _can_ use that rule. Like always treating let, do, in, etc as ""{""'s in C:<p><pre><code>    f = let\n            x = 1\n        in\n            let\n                y = x + 2\n            in\n                y + 1\n</code></pre>\nThis may look a little verbose. But in real cases there would be a lot more statements there. In the middle of all this I want to maintain the idea ""number of tabs corresponds to lexical scope"". We can also push the analogy to ""{""'s in C and adopt the ""K&R"" style, but on block-starting expressions:<p><pre><code>    f = let\n        x = 1 in let\n            y = x + 2 in\n                y + 1\n\n</code></pre>\nThere's also the solution of editors that just figure out where to indent, in which case we can make it look pretty and still get the indentation right. I think it's best to develop a consistent style that will work across editors though.",1290800115

Thought it might help to provide some context around this.<p>It's not that you can't make a fast UI with a template-oriented system.  The problem HTML makes it very easy for you to do a lot of things - some are very fast, others are very slow.  There is no clear line which is which since it has more to do with how you use the DOM than anything else.  To make matters worse, the fast paths are different on different browsers.<p>What this means is that if you want to build really fast UI in the browser using a DOM-centric, template-based system, you are basically taking on all the responsibility to do everything in a fast way yourself.  (Which means you also need to know all the little tricks to doing this - many of which are not obvious.)  The framework won't be able to really help you.<p>This is why a JS-based API that takes ownership over the DOM instead of exposing most of it directly to you can be much faster.  We can take this crazy world and turn it right side up again with a cogent API that makes it easy to do fast things and harder to do slow things.<p>hth.",1290799340

Yesterday we reported on the site rapgodfathers.com which was seized and pointed to the same landing page (+ analytics).<p>This was confirmed by the owner (plus another source) and a search warrant from a US district Court. See <a href=""http://torrentfreak.com/music-linking-site-raided-by-dept-of-homeland-security-ice-101125/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://torrentfreak.com/music-linking-site-raided-by-dept-of...</a><p>2. Today reports came in on more sites. We've known the owner of torrent-finder for a few years and spoke with him about what happened.<p>He confirmed that ICANN was involved and that Godaddy knew nothing about the actions. He also told us some more information that we were told not to post in public. Combined with yesterday's raid the story added up.<p>3. About the analytics... My guess would be that the hosting company put that there, but it may also be the authorities.<p>4. Dozens of sites are involved in this, all with different owners.<p>A hoax seems to be impossible. But then again, we're just simple bloggers, and thought we had enough info to back the story. If anyone disagrees, please say so.",1290798067

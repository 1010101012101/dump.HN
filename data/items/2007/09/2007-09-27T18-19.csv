Because of this it probably isn't as useful as the Stanford collection if you're just looking for famous people giving business advice.<p>edit: The interviews with Tony Dellamano and Mark Kuperman about their food startup are actually pretty good.<p><a href=""http://eclips.cornell.edu/entrepreneur.do;jsessionid=41794ACD6B8B75C48029F74B23D03A66?id=249"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eclips.cornell.edu/entrepreneur.do;jsessionid=41794AC...</a><p><a href=""http://eclips.cornell.edu/entrepreneur.do;jsessionid=41794ACD6B8B75C48029F74B23D03A66?id=250"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eclips.cornell.edu/entrepreneur.do;jsessionid=41794AC...</a>",1190918784

Then I accidentally committed a slightly broken version, and it took the entire site down.  Then, in my panic, my darcs-fu failed me, and I couldn't get the patches to unpull properly.  <p>Moral: even someone who looks great on paper can do something unbelievably stupid.

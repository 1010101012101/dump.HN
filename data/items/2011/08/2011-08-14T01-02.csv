2882524,comment,2881150,2881150,1,0,mekarpeles,,,"I can understand your confusion if you were expecting an article which discussed the fundamentals of RESTful interfaces and how it pertains to server client relationships. The intention of the article wasn't as much to introduce the concept of representational state transfer as much as it was, 'how can one use a RESTful API', hence the title, ""Using RESTful APIs"". I can appreciate that the introduction lacked adequate explanation of REST, itself -- and it's more than reasonable to expect an article on RESTful APIs to cover, well, RESTful APIs.<p>That said, I am thankful for your constructive criticisms and will revise my post so that its content is more satisfactory.<p>Pak, thank you for the w3 resource. As it says in the reference, it does seem that 256 was the limit for prior implementations; however, it seems my understanding was indeed based on outdated material. In response to your other criticism, which example is never shown so I may add it?<p>If you have suggestions on topics I should include or other resources I should review before making changes, suggestions would be appreciated.<p>Cheers",1313286787
2882523,comment,2882356,2882356,1,0,Joakal,,,"I'm doing a project that I think will help globally albeit it's a hobby project (as long I finish it, haha). The thing about my project is that it's not about altruistic desire to help people, it's about building towards something grander for me, a home in space.<p>The YC and other entrepreneurs ALWAYS help people. If they didn't, their business folds. Because simply: it's not useful to people. eg They created an app to put moustaches on every picture; you may think it's not helping people but it'll give a smile to families who see the wedding pictures with moustaches everywhere. So, help to people is quite subjective.<p>On the other hand, it sounds like you're doing a 'numbers of helping many people for as little work possible'. This is incredibly hard. For example, if you give water to communities but you also have to deal with culture that creates inefficiency issues. eg Corruption, malice, war and population issues. Yes, you could be exacerbating the problem by making their lives easier but in long term worst as so many people are reliant on you giving water. Don't always assume that helping many people at once will be the best solution.<p>I hope you seek something that's very helpful and is long term solution for them. Even if it's only helping one person. If that person lives to wealthy world life expectancy, that's better than many suffering at once because that person can pass on knowledge, etc.<p>If you want to get some ideas, listening to problems is usually helpful, then brainstorm with it. eg over a million children are trafficked; maybe create cheap GPS transmitters for children so parents in home countries can track their children's 'work opportunities' and report discrepancies. Bonus: There's an awful lot of lazy people or people with not enough time that talk about ideas but never execute them. Since you want to execute something, you have a lot of research and brainstorm material done for you!<p>Some directions to go from:<p><a href=""http://www.good.is/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.good.is/</a><p><a href=""http://itstartswith.us/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itstartswith.us/</a><p><a href=""http://www.charitynavigator.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.charitynavigator.org/</a><p><a href=""http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-08-13/12m-children-trafficked-each-year-report/1390058"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-08-13/12m-children-trafficke...</a><p>Last tip: Try to release your project! It's time wasted if you let it be in obscurity. If you don't want to do it any more, release it anyway. eg free code repositories, free blog post with project notes and research, etc. People like me who want to do something similar to you will be able to make use of it.",1313286769

Yes people are dying in remote places, yes people need healthcare in the US, and yes not everyone has a job. You want to try and fix the situation, but many others also have tried, and failed.<p>Maybe you want to do that to be relieve of your guilt, to try and find happiness instead. I mean it's very popular to say that you are trying to change the world, making it a better place, and so on, but then in the end, will it make you happy?<p>And even worse- what is your final objective? Being happy?<p>Maybe you perceive a dysfunction is the way the world works vs how you think it should work. Then your goal might be to ""remove biais"", or be ""less wrong"". Some blogger might help you in your path.<p>If your goal is finding consistence, there are many ways which do not always involve doing ""something meaningful"" in the sense of charity work. Abstaining from charity and being vocal about it, trying to make more people join such absentionist movements, might be very positive. A lot of people believe the problems for exemple in Africa are due to foreign involvement creating a long lasting dependance on aid, food, and so on. Basically, it might not be good to have more people on a continent that can be fed by the production of this given continent. Here the lack of action would have dire consequences in the short term, but would improve the situation in the long term - and it would be self consistent.<p>If you goal is happiness, a better shortcut might be finding happiness without having to resort to such a guilt-ridden trip of charity, ie learnt to not care anylonger!<p>If your your goal is being popular, ie respond to peer pressure which views charity work in a positive light, maybe you could find some other way that is also well received - say american idol, a free software project that'll make you famous, fight again racism/global warming/whatever is popular these days.<p>But from what I have read in your message, I would sincerily question your premises.<p>Instead of doing what is better ""for the world"" or ""for the global good"", have you considered the possibility of doing ""what's fun"", ""what you like"", or ""what is important to you""? You do not need justifications or moral endorsement to do that. Yet it requires some serious introspection.<p>If you do have considered these alternatives, and if you are sure of your premises, have you identified limitating beliefs, ie the reason why you consider these alternatives not to be worth your limited time on this earth?",1313285294

2882475,comment,2882014,2882014,3,0,cleverjake,,,"I worked at a high end audio shop for a few years. I saw everything from $80,000 audio /cables/ to $150,000 turntables. There is a lot of snake oil, but articles like this upset me for two reasons.
Firstly, the lumping of ""audiophiles"". Most of the people who refer to themselves as such are nut balls (in my experience).  There were a few that were great and heard amazing ears, but most of the time - nut balls. Guys that spent more time listening to tone recordings and day dreaming about their own perfect setup then they did actually listening to music. 
Secondly, there /is/ a difference in wire/speaker box/electrical source/whatever - but it doesn't mean that the more expensive one is better. It is about synergy. Quick example: I had a pair of small rega speakers with a set of $5,000 nordost speaker cables. Sounded awful - worse than a car radio. I swapped it out for the set of the generic cables that came with it - blew away half the speakers in the shop that were two to ten times the price. There were also times when the /best/ sound really was a tube amp with separate power drop, acoustical treated wall, and the whole shebang. Every little change you make makes a difference, every solder  joint counts. 
Do yourself a favor if you are at all interested in this, and stop by your local big city hi-fi shop (not best buy, magnolia or any other chain, something that has upwards of $10k speakers in stock preferably) and try out the different sets. You will be swayed.",1313284862

This is going nowhere.<p>What's been removed are the tollgates we've grown accustomed to over the past 20 - 600 years.<p>Market econmics are predicated on producers, consumers, goods, utility derived from those goods, <i>and a pricing and revenue collection model.</i><p>Market failures occur where any of these elements can't be satisfied: where production isn't possible, where consumers are disenfranchised (through poverty, discrimination, or other means), where large positive or negative externalities exist (an externality is a consequence of production or consumption whose cost or benefit isn't fully captured: pollution, traffic congestion, and free-riders are all externalities).  Or where a price or revenue collection scheme can't be created.<p>Traditional tollgates include, well, toll gates, box offices, storefronts, circulation departments, service subscriptions, and the like.<p>If a good is deemed significantly important to produced by individuals, governments, or groups, it may be provided on other bases:  public goods (paid through taxation), charities (paid through voluntary donations), patronage works (bought for prestige or other purposes by the wealthy but not for their exclusive consumption).<p>The existing ""information economy"" is very much a creature of technology and society since the printing press, prior to which mass production of informational works wasn't posisble. <i>All</i> information and music was bespoke.<p>Absent mass production, we had: town criers, wandering minstrels and acting troupes, church and court-sponsored works of art (much of classical music and art). Most information was scarce. Libraries were (by modern standards) small and highly valued. A given person, if literate, might have access to a iven book once in a lifetime.<p>The printing press, phonograph, telegraphy, film, broadcast radio, broadcast television, electrically amplified instruments, telephony, cable, and the Internet not only changed the <i>market</i> for information and entertainment works, but <i>changed the works themselves.</i><p>Broadsheet newspapers were a function of early printing presses. Film displaced live theater performance, as did recorded music (Sydney Australia saw a rise in ""discos"" vs. live-music venues along with gaming due in part to tax and cost structures).  Big-band gave way to 3 and 4 piece quartets with amplification. ""Singer-songwriters"" and ""recording artists"" are two different responses to copyright laws and payment requirements (songwriters receive mechanical royalties, RAs are much cheaper for recording labels to produce and promote).  Weekly ""magazines"" were an answer to the news, information, and distribution technologies of the time.<p>Broadcast media necessitated a radical revisiting of previous revenue models, which ultimately resulted in a royalty collection scheem largely based on mechanical means (there are few restrictions on public performance of a work, but a set fee must be paid), with compliance based on a mix of audits and recordkeeping (small live-performance venues work roughly similarly). The system is hardly perfect (payola has been a huge problem for over half a century), but monies get paid, if not always to the artists.<p>The Internet, its distribution mechanisms, cost structures, and the priority on lifting restrictions on most forms of mass media, make traditional ""paywalls"" problematic at best.<p>At the same time, there have been very strong tendencies to consolidation in the basic backbone and search spaces particularly. There is a service and revenue relationship generally at the ISP / service-provider level.  A sampling/audit based mechanical system tied to this with revenues being distributed to artists and publsihers is likely the ultimate outcome, for the large case, with smaller one-off solutions attempted elsewhere (specific subscriptions). One benefit of such an Internet Royalty Audit Syndicate (IRAS) would be that the <i>online source</i> of a work wouldn't matter so long as attribution of authorship/ownership could be reasonably established, and such an element should be a design goal of any such system.<p>""Pirate sites"" would simply become additional legitimate distribution channels. As well they should be.<p>It's also highly probable that the price point of works created will shift down the cost curve. When distribution channels are few, outlets are many, and marketing/promotion costs are high, it makes sense to focus on a small number of blockbuster works. When channels are many, control is diffuse, and entry barriers are low, individual works can and will be produced at lower costs. Marketing will remain a major expense, though community/viral methods can compete with more conventional institutional/mass means.",1313284449

and 180 is (-1) - (-1) - (-1) - (-1) - (-1) .... after all. (or any other number given the appropriate definition of trigonometrical functions itself)<p>The fact that we give a special meaning to the + operation and to 1, is just psychological, it's just a matter of defining symbols.<p>So let's define a=-1 and the operator , as -, we get:<p>exp(sqrt(h) (h,h,h,h,h,h....,h))=h<p>So all we have is: e^x, subtraction, multiplication, -1, and square root (of -1 again). 
While the original syntax for the formula has, e^x, addition, multiplication, i, pi, 0, 1. 
So we reduced the number of concepts at the expense of making the expression longer (183 repetitions the symbol h)<p>But if we accept author's freedom to choose an arbitrary angle measure unit, we could define another unit for angles and have:<p>exp(sqrt(-1))=-1 (so only e^, sqrt and -1: magical link between e and -1)<p>Btw, there is also no need for operators to use 'symbols', letters are symbols, it's just a convention (as operator precedence), so let's rephrase it:<p>d'oh hahahahahah...h ugh<p>Isn't that beautiful?

E.g.<p>given that pi = ln(-1) / sqrt(-1)<p>e^(sqrt(-1) * ln(-1) / sqrt(-1)) = -1<p>e^(ln(-1)) = -1<p>-1 = -1<p>EDIT: that's obvious just because we type it as ln(-1) instead of i * pi, but they do have the same value, so they are interchangeable symbols.<p>btw, IANAM, so not sure about the math, but as computer scientist all this sounds to me as playing with symbols, so one could argue that you can demonstrate that ln(-1) is pi * i by using euler identity, but perhaps going the other way around has the same mathematical value? any idea?<p>EDIT: I know that the ln(-1) = i * pi is a direct result of the euler identity, so using it to prove euler's identity is bogus. I meant we could define ln(-1) as being a primitive constant and the expression would have a different shape. It was just an example of why I think the canonical way of expressing the euler's identity is called beautiful, because it's not trivially simplifiable.",1313284014

[8]<p>---------------------------------------------------------------<p>[1] There's a list of 250 items.<p>[2] Each item has a ""code"" consisting of three alphanumeric characters. Each character was randomly chosen -- so ""AA0"" is a possible item name.<p>[3] No two items have the same code. (NB: This is not explicitly stated and does affect the outcome.)<p>[4] Five randomly chosen items are ""specials"" today.<p>[5] Everyone can see ""today's codes"": a list of all the characters that are in at least one ""special"". So for example if the specials are ""AA1"", ""AA2"", ""AA3"", ""AA4"", and ""AA5"", everyone can see that ""today's codes"" are the characters ""A12345"".<p>[6] We say an item ""appears to be a special"" if all the characters in its code are in ""today's codes"".<p>[7] We want to know:<p>What is the probability that,<p><pre><code>  if I pick an item from the list which appears to be a special, 

  it actually is not a special?

A quick & dirty Monte Carlo simulation proceeds as follows:<p>[A] This is how to generate the probability that this happens in a single trial.<p>(1) Store a list of 250 distinct three-character alphanumeric strings, chosen from the alphabet 0...9A...Z. This is ""the list"".<p>(2) Randomly choose five items from ""the list"". Record the five items as ""today's specials"". For each letter in each item, record the fact that ""this letter is one of today's codes.""<p>(3) Compute the denominator: how many items on ""the list"" contain today's codes.<p>(4) Compute the numerator: how many items on ""the list"" contain today's codes and are not one of ""today's specials"".<p>(5) Return the numerator divided by the denominator as the probability, in this trial, that you picked an apparent special which was not actually a special.<p>[B] Perform [A] a lot of times and average the probability returned in each trial.<p>This is not amenable to a quick Monte Carlo simulation. But after 100k trials it does seem to stabilize into one approximate region.<p>The actual answer that the system apparently wants (via brute force & curl) I do not understand at all.

I did that by pretty aggressively submitting new articles.  And, it worked.<p>Part of the reason that I initially karma whored was because I was trying to get a bit of name recognition for when I finally applied to YC.  I applied this past fall.  Didn't even get an interview, so one of my big motivations for being as active on the site was gone.<p>In hindsight, I'm glad I didn't get in.  It's given me  a lot of perspective.  I've thought a _lot about the incubation process.  I've had thousands of conversations about startups and investors, and the incubator process at Hackers & Founders events over the years.  I've also thought a _ton_ about why the demand to get into YC is so high.<p>My current answer is that the market for early stage capital is extremely inefficient, even in Silicon Valley.  There are hundreds if not thousands of early startups here, who have _no idea what investors are looking for. They have no idea how to approach an investor.  They have no idea what investors are worth talking to at what stages, etc...  And, because that market is so inefficient, there is an extremely high demand for intermediaries like YC, Angel Pad, Tech Stars, IO Ventures, StartX, etc...  that can show them the ropes.<p>But, these intermediaries don't really fix the problem.  They are middle men, and they charge a premium in terms of equity stakes to be middle men.<p>For investors, the incubators do fix the filtering problem, and that's certainly worth a great deal to them.  For the startups, a lot of them wouldn't get their start if it weren't for the incubators.  But, if the market was more transparent and efficient, there would be less of a need for intermediaries and middle men.<p>So, we're going to try to fix these problems in the startup market at Hackers & Founders.  It's a Quixotic task.  But, I think we have a decent shot of being able to fix some of these long standing problems in Silicon Valley and help fix some of these problems globally.<p>So, this past summer, we boot strapped an incubator though Hackers & Founders, to try and see if we could ""fix"" some of these problems.  And, it worked.  The six companies that we had weekly dinners with have all raised a total of $1.5M. And, 3 of the 6 are still heavily fund raising right now.  And, I'm still working as a nurse.<p>We're not going to make a lot of money at this.  We're certainly not interested in becoming investors.  We'll ask for an advisory stake, however.  The chance to hack Silcon Valley is just a little bit too cool a hack to let pass by, however.<p>I'm done with YC.  I still have a lot of friends who are YC companies, and I certainly have a lot of friends here.<p>So, now, when I come to post, it's to see what my friends are talking about, and maybe chat a little.  I'm still picking up karma because of brand recognition, I think.  But, I really stopped caring about how high my karma score was about a year ago.",1313283601

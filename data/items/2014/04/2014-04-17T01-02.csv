A sleep deficit can&#x27;t be &quot;paid off&quot; as you might pay off a financial obligation. If you overdraw from a checking account, you can settle up by making one larger-than-usual deposit. If you stay awake for three days, then sleep much longer than usual doesn&#x27;t give you a full cognitive recovery. It might be more accurate to think of staying awake as taking out a loan with very high interest.<p>EDIT: This is a difficult concept to understand because it sounds like a semantic difference.

So the monthly fee is enough to cover the storage and bandwidth that most users are realistically ever going to use. And when you have a lot of users, the average is the only thing that matters. If you use 1PB, you&#x27;re being subsidized, not by the company but by a thousand low-utilization users.<p>In addition, they&#x27;re probably betting on the price of storage to go down roughly in proportion to the gradual increase of average utilization over time. Actually, this is a relatively safe bet. 6TB drives now occupy the price point that 4TB drives used to occupy, which in turn can now be had for what 2TB drives cost a few years ago. With SMR & HAMR on the horizon and with neat tricks like stuffing 7 platters in a single drive filled with helium, this trend is likely to continue for quite a while (unless the Thai factories get flooded again).",1397698750

The vast majority of complaints about JS have to do with not knowing what the language is designed to do. I previously cursed JS until I spent the time to read/reread enough JS books to know what it should do. If I get unexpected behavior now, I know it&#x27;s an error in my code, or I don&#x27;t understand what should happen (thus time for me to read and learn).<p>As you pointed out, the examples yield the expected behavior.<p>myRide.drive();<p>// outputs &#x27;BMW&#x27; b/c `this` is pointing to the instance<p>letsDrive = myRide.drive;<p>letsDrive();<p>// model should be undefined b/c myRide.drive is a function that is assigned to the letsDrive variable. Thus, `this` points to letsDrive, which of course does not have a `model` property.<p>To get letsDrive() to output a value other than undefined, we can simply create a `model` property and assign it a value.<p>letsDrive.model = &#x27;Mercedes&#x27;;<p>letsDrive();<p>// outputs &#x27;Mercedes&#x27; b/c letsDrive now has a model property.<p>Lastly, the `delayed` method returns an anonymous function which in turn returns this.model.

The trick with informal mathematics is that the author and the reader (a) share a large amount of background and (b) tacitly assume that the text is talking about something interesting. So, given those things, you can usually resolve ambiguity by assuming that the proof is referring to the interesting part at hand instead of some boring detail.<p>The downside to that is the ambiguity sometimes causes bugs.<p>Formal proofs can be very long. It&#x27;s an open problem today as to how to compress and decomplect them. It&#x27;s extremely similar to the situation with programming.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that I intend to refute your argument at its core—clarity does not imply great verbosity in my mind—but instead to color your example a little more.

Sue me.<p>I&#x27;ve written 2-3 large applications in Angular, I&#x27;ve contributed ~1200 lines to Angular 1.3, and racked up a lot of  points on StackOverflow answering questions around Angular.<p>However, I&#x27;m currently working on a pretty crazy real-time app for Netflix that&#x27;s all in Ember, and I wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way. I have the pleasure of working with @ebryn there, and it&#x27;s been an awesome experience.<p>In this poll, there are really just those two frameworks. The others frankly aren&#x27;t in the same league right now.<p>I&#x27;ve yet to read what I thought was an unbiased, honest comparison of the two. Generally, anyone that does a comparison has one favorite, and the other they barely know. I&#x27;m hoping to remedy that at some point, but I still feel my Angular experience out-weighs my Ember experience. At least for now.<p>However, preliminarily, I can say that both frameworks are absolutely brilliant attempts to solve similar problems in completely different ways. I think they both have a LOT they could learn from one another. I prefer a convention-based approach, which is one thing I love about Ember... That said, I prefer Angular&#x27;s constructor-based DI over the setter-based DI of Ember... That said, both of them have somewhat primitive IOC  containers that could be better (which is a whole blog post by itself)... THAT said, Angular allows developers to put too much logic in their templates via expressions (harder to test)... THAT said, Ember&#x27;s structure and composition isn&#x27;t quite as easy to pick up if you&#x27;re new to the framework... THAT said, Angular doesn&#x27;t require any other libraries and is very compact... THAT said Angular&#x27;s directives allow for wild-west spaghetti code and give developers enough rope to hang themselves... blah blah blah<p>... the point is, I could go on forever. Both libraries have REAL advantages over one another, but libraries have REAL disadvantages over one another as well.<p># Embular.js in 2016!!

The pressure from Wall Street is due to, well, the pressure from Wall Street. If analysts on Wall Street form a consensus around a company&#x27;s expected earnings, then the market will price in that consensus. If that consensus turns out to be wrong, the market will (in theory) adjust accordingly.<p>In other words, if analysts are (in retrospect) over-optimistic, the stock temporarily becomes mis-priced and expensive (relative to an unknowable reality at the time) until the earnings report. Usually these analysts&#x27; look to the company&#x27;s guidance (edit: or in google&#x27;s case, the lack thereof) in forming their valuation. Add it all up and it&#x27;s hard to see how there is pressure on a company to beat expectations, since they have the ability to set conservative guidance and try to get analysts to come to a consensus that is in line with the numbers that actually come up. If the company is performing poorly, they either depress the stock price in advance (under promise, over deliver) or later (over promise, under deliver) but regardless of when this happens if you buy into the EMH the stock is always trading at the proper value, behavioral economics notwithstanding.<p>For an example of an exception to this rule, see AAPL which routinely beats estimates yet sells off. One theory is that there is such latent fear that Apple is losing its mojo, each earnings report is a reminder that their growth doesn&#x27;t compare to the old days, so investors flee despite their return on capital being extremely competitive.",1397698266

Special relativity, general relativity, quantum mechanics, QED, all these theories are theories because they gave predictions which were confirmed by experiment. Newton&#x27;s laws, universal gravitation, these too have so much experimental backing so they are theory too, it&#x27;s just that they are valid for non-relativistic, non-quantum systems. Just because you found that light bends around stars doesn&#x27;t mean that all the basic experiments you did on the earth that didn&#x27;t seem to show that bending 50 years ago were all a lie. Your old experiments were still valid! You just weren&#x27;t looking at a scale where such effects were important: those mirrors and lenses didn&#x27;t have enough mass to make the light bend enough for you to measure it (the deviations were but small fractions of the markings on your ruler) so you simply didn&#x27;t see such effects. When you do look at that scales*, however, you&#x27;ll see divergence from theory, and thus the cycle repeats, and the boundaries of understanding are pushed forward.<p>We never forgot the old theory, we just find where it fails and how it really was only correct for a smaller scale than we thought it was. Think about science as the old explorers of Columbus&#x27; day; they had a very small view of the world, but as they explored, they found that they could add new features to their maps. Nothing about their old maps of Europe had changed though! May be new technology had made the maps more refined, but discovering the West Indies didn&#x27;t make Germany south of France! It&#x27;s similar for science. Nothing about modern physics makes us doubt a lot of Newton&#x27;s results, we just know he wasn&#x27;t 100% correct.",1397697143

That&#x27;s the only way we&#x27;re going to get a clear, decisive precedent, because otherwise the procedural blunders will dominate the legal result.<p>Levison&#x27;s failure to contact the EFF or ACLU the moment he received the first pen/trap order has led us all to waste a lot of time and resources litigating mostly peripheral issues, and probably caused a lot more hardship for Levison himself than he ever needed to get into. Meanwhile, we still don&#x27;t have a clear idea of what the U.S. legal system thinks about forcing the disclosure of SSL private keys.<p>Of course, hindsight is 20/20, so maybe there are adequate explanations for why he thought it was a good idea to wave a middle finger in the face of the DOJ.<p>But in the grand scheme of things in the battle for internet freedom, I think we just missed a golden opportunity to get the courts to tackle some serious constitutional issues.

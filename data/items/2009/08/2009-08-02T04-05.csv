    :ul :id ""site-menu""
    dolist (menu-item (list ""home"" ""news"" ""blog"" ""aboutus""))
      :li (:a :href concat(*server-root* menu-item) menu-item)
</code></pre>
Should generate this:<p><pre><code>  <ul id=""site-menu"">
    <li><a href=""example.com/home"">home</a></li>
    <li><a href=""example.com/news"">news</a></li>
    <li><a href=""example.com/blog"">blog</a></li>
    <li><a href=""example.com/aboutus"">aboutus</a></li>
  </ul>
</code></pre>
Then in a CSS page referenced by that presentation, you do whatever you want to #site-menu; you make it a vertical menu, horizontal, tabbed, or even generate big fat fish-eye icons that look like the Mac's. HTML knows <i>nothing</i> of that.<p>Used in this sense, HTML is a very good object code.",1249189091

Or would we all be coding for aolserver and bitching about how to get our websites approved on different cable networks?<p>And the stuff about the source being paid for is a red herring, only a very few licenses prohibit the sale of software (and the GPL explicitly allows it, the only restriction is that if you sell software built with GPL components you must provide the source as well as the object code).",1249187764

But this article is insane, and that's by the Barron's hot stock article standards.<p>Everyone knows that marketplaces - AT SCALE - are perfect stores: no inventory, no theft, all margin.  And Amazon's third-party Marketplace is nowhere near as robust as conventional wisdom says it is.  But eBay is surely declining - in revenue, in market share, and most importantly, in mindshare.  Many people consider eBay a place to dispose of items, but not a place to make purchases.  eBay's buyer universe is shrinking; the issue is that it's not clear where it's going (it's not going to Amazon, based on my channel checks).<p>Of course, the Skype IPO is on hold due to the P2P IP lawsuit.  Yes, the crown jewel is PayPal.  PayPal should be spun off; not Skype.  But the heavy users of PayPal (merchants) are the most technically sophisticated, cost conscious group I know.  PayPal can be beat since merchants really don't like dealing with international transactions (which is the only place where PayPal has a sustainable competitive advantage).<p>I could go on and on - but I love eBay as a company, and I hate EBAY as a stock.<p>[EDIT: I am a (is my registration lapsed? - I should find out) financial advisor, but I am not your financial advisor.

737063,comment,736578,736578,0,0,Virax,,,"Here is my take on FOSS, I hope you find it interesting:<p>* FOSS is great at very small number of things: C compiler (gcc), Operating system (Linux), programming languages (zillions), Apache, MySQL, and a few others.<p>* FOSS is OK at a certain number of larger areas - relatively simple games (BzTank), office applications (Open Office)<p>* FOSS is absolutely horrible at new product development. Anyone with a brain and a decent idea that SOME people MIGHT pay for can see that FOSS is inferior to all of these:<p><pre><code>   * web-based subscription model
   * web-based advertising model
   * closed source shrinkwrap model
   * closed-source consulting model
</code></pre>
The only reason you would choose FOSS over these is you don't believe anyone would pay anything for what you want to make (but they might donate after using it). At this point, if you still choose to develop, then<p><pre><code>   A) It is a hobby, and the only thing tying you to the project is your interest

   B) You can choose between freeware/shareware and FOSS
</code></pre>
The game Dwarf Fortress is a good example of freeware. The creators want to retain artistic control over their creation, so they release as closed source software.<p>In conclusion, if you release source code, then:<p><pre><code>   * others may improve the product, which benefits you because you are using it

   * you may lose artistic control due to fork pressure
</code></pre>
If you don't release source code, then:<p><pre><code>   * you have to do all of the development yourself or through people you hire

   * you retain total control over the product
</code></pre>

In case one of the above does happen, is there some way for me prove that I am the true author of the work?<p>I read a post on HN a while ago that discussed copyright. Over there one solution was to pay $35 fee and get all your work officially copyrighted. It seems like the best way to protect one's work but the only problem is $35 is a bit too expensive in my case. I intend on releasing code & papers that discuss new ideas frequently (probably monthly, if not weekly). In that case 35 bucks is a bit too much to pay even on a monthly basis.<p>The nice thing about the $35 option is that you can copyright all of your work in one filing (done online at http://www.copyright.gov/eco/index.html).

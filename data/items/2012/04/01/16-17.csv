Rumors say a 15"" Air-ish MacBook Pro is on its way (with fast, quad core processors and 4-8 GB ram).<p>I have to oppose this. OS X's Mission Control is not at all good for a developer. Not at all as efficient as using some window manager with dedicated and numbered desktops, e.g. Xmonad.<p>The other thing which annoyed me when I worked with OS X machine was the absence of a good package manager for every application. I had to use my Macbook for work when I was working from home. I had to install GCC and MySQL, which took almost an hour of my precious time. Never had that kind of problems with Arch or Ubuntu.",1333299554

The value of that is that when a high-level test fails in some inscrutable way, in theory a corresponding unit test should also fail, which should make the actually point of breakage clear.",1333299488

The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.<p>It's widely held that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. We believe that faster sharing of research will lead to an acceleration in research innovation: faster innovation in medicine, biology, engineering, economics, and other fields. Faster sharing in biology and medicine, for example, could lead to cancer being solved 12 months before it otherwise would have been, which would lead to millions of lives being saved.<p>Academia.edu has over 1.1 million registered users, and over 3.5 million monthly unique visitors. Both of these metrics tripled in 2011. Over 4,500 papers are added to the platform each day, and over 3,000 academics join each day.<p>We need talented engineers to come and help us accelerate the world's research. We believe that there is a chance to make a big impact.<p>We just raised $4.5 million from Spark Capital and True Ventures <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3297812"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3297812</a>.

You can participate in those general startup decisions as much or as little as you want. We have found that our decisions are much better as a result of everyone contributing to them.

3784220,comment,3783970,3783970,1,0,PhillipT,,,"It is worth being aware that contracts are either express or implied. An express contract is one where the terms of which are stated in words. An implied contract is one where the existence and terms of the contract are manifested by conduct of the involved parties. A contractual agreement can be oral and in many US states (for example California) and Countries (UK etc) it is enforceable - especially if there are witnesses or proof of joint activities etc. Your best bet to get out of the situation is follow Tzunamiton's good advice  and find someone you both trust and that you can both agree as an impartial adjudicator. Then discuss with the adjudicator to  either wind the company up or get a written termination agreement that you are both willing to sign. If you want to pursue the idea then the termination agreement between you and your former partner must set out the payment terms and limit or sign away any future claims against the idea/ip. hope this helps.",1333299341

My elbows became swollen and painful to the point I couldn't sleep. I took ibuprofen for a while to help, but eventually the amount it took to alleviate pain caused a mild overdose (2800mg in 24 hours is bad juju). Every doctor I went to see told me the same thing - you're going to have to get away from the keyboard. I was fairly certain I'd have to switch careers entirely.<p>The thing that made the difference for me was paying attention to how I treated my body. You can spend a lot of money to prevent RSI symptoms, but the most important things for me was an egg timer. I started taking 5 minute breaks every 45 minutes to stretch my hands and arms. Now I use AntiRSI (<a href=""http://tech.inhelsinki.nl/antirsi/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tech.inhelsinki.nl/antirsi/</a>) to do the same thing.<p>The most significant change to equipment was my chair and desk. I invested in a good chair that I could adjust easily - elbow height (and rotation) and seat height in particular. Being at the correct height and angle makes all the difference.<p>I bought a zero tension mouse (<a href=""http://bit.ly/HAZYov"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/HAZYov</a>), which seemed to help with my mousing hand, and had a MS Natural Keyboard at the time. I've since moved on to a kinesis that I like a lot.<p>Exercise also seems to help - I'm an active rock climber at this point, and it's helped my posture and arm strength.<p>To the general 'what if you lose function of your hands', I think there's hope. The most important things we do as programmers isn't typing. It's solving problems. If you can still do that and you can communicate those ideas effectively to others, you'll have a lot to offer.",1333299054

""You know, Jim, I've seen a lot more businesses go broke because they didn't have enough sales than I've seen go under from lack of computers. Why don't you work on first things first?""<p>Selling is a devalued skill. It's considered beneath anyone with an M.B.A.'s training. Marketing, on the other hand, is somehow ""clean,"" something professional businesspeople aspire to. If you go to a cocktail party and you're asked what you do for a living, and you reply, ""I'm a salesman,"" people look at you like you've got crumbs on your shirt. Tell them you're a marketing director, however, and they say ""How interesting.""\nIn my view, this is one of the worst hoaxes ever pulled on American business. Manufacturers perceive marketing as a magic solution that takes away their responsibility for making good products. Their idea is, we'll make a product that's just as good as anything else out there--not better, mind you, but just as good--and marketing it well will make us rich. And that's a lot of crap.<p>Marketing is all about creating, in the customer's mind, a value that does not exist: a way of differentiating a basically undifferentiated product and charging the consumer more money for it. Selling is fundamental.<p>Consumers are not idiots. They want detergents that get their clothes cleaner, not detergents with slicker advertising campaigns.<p>Because, sad to say, it's a lot easier to differentiate your product through the quality of the marketing than through the quality of the product. To go back to the automobile industry, it's easier to change your advertising campaign than it is to build a better car--as General Motors well knows.",1333297172

In the first case it is the manufacturer, in the second case the seller of the product.<p>The second distinction is to when it applies. In the first case Apple will repair anything that breaks during coverage, unless the damage is caused by carelessness. In the second case the ""warranty"" only applies to what is alredy broken when the seller gives you the device. Examples where this warranty does not hold, is when your hard drive breaks after 8 month or some connections ports stop working after 14 months although they once worked.<p>In summary the European warranty reduces to a protection for the customer, that the seller doesn't deliver a broken product. So in principle a manufacturer doesn't need to give any warranty at all, but the sellers would not be comfortable with that as in the first 6 months, they have to prove to the customer that the product was working at delivery, which is arguably impossible.<p>The only case where the European law results in additional coverage for the customer compared to the year apple gives, is when a defect was present at delivery and the customer only noticed it after one year and is able to prove that the defect was there at the beginning. I would like to see someone trying to prove that there was a manufacturing defect causing a connection port to disconnect from the motherboard after 14 month (or did you yank on that cord to much?...).",1333297170

While EU mandates a minimum of 2 years, in some countries, this time period can be longer, like in Sweden where it's 3 years. However, there is a big difference between warranty and a consumer complaint case: Apple's warranty covers things that break <i>after</i> the customer has received the product - essentially a guarantee that the customer will be able to enjoy 12 months of fault-free goods - while a consumer complaint case covers defects and flaws (including false or erroneous marketing) that were present in the product <i>before</i> the customer received it. Examples of this can be a manufacturer claiming that an LCD screen is a 24-bit truecolor display while it is in fact an 18-bit dithering display, or claiming a certain resolution for a digital camera higher than the camera's sensor can actually provide.<p>If something in the product that was working ok and as advertised for 1 year suddenly breaks, you're not covered by Apple's warranty, and you're not covered by the consumer protection laws of the EU. If you within the established consumer complaint time period find that something about the product isn't as it should or isn't as advertised, you have a legal right to a full refund providing that you can prove that the problem in question accompanied the product when you received it.<p>The bottom line: you still just have 1 year of <i>warranty</i>, but now Apple also lets you know that you have another type of consumer right that extends beyond the warranty period.",1333296392

(aka ""player hatin'"")<p>2) Level playing field.  It's nice to imagine that everyone has the same amount of ""luck,"" and therefore the same chance of being successful. It's disheartening to accept that some people might work harder or have more natural talent than you. Chalking it up to ""luck"" gives you hope that it could just as easily happen to you one day.<p>""Hope is the only thing stronger than fear"" - Hunger Games<p>Btw, I think what the OMGPOP guy wrote on Twitter was mean and dumb.  He shouldn't have written it.  And I don't know these guys.<p>And I actually believe that most success is rooted in luck (or chance or circumstance).

Why did he write that article NOW? There is already a well deserved Anti Zynga sentiment and that article made his fellow employees look as if they were traitors to the forces of good. He admits that he has done work for Zynga in the past but then drops lines like ""Not everyone shares my values, and not everyone is in a position to pick and choose job offers."".

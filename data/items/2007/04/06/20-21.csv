9720,comment,9567,9583,0,0,aston,,,"You've completely omitted the real reason people stay with Digg: network effects. The more people using a Digg-like site, the more valuable it is. Digg clones don't have the traffic, so of course they can't compete.<p>Switching from Windows to Mac is more of an issue of legacy. If all of the software you like using works only on Windows, and if all of the people in your organization only know Windows, it's going to be difficult (costly) for you to switch.<p>How are these related to 37signals products? Not very. There are no network effects involved, so that's out. And while you may have a legacy with 37signals, it's such a new product, your organization could probably afford to switch to a competitor without much cost.<p>The question posed in the article is a good one, then, since if you could match feature for feature and you could do it for cheaper, you'd beat 37signals at their own game.",1175893128
9719,comment,9667,9716,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Gaming the applications process already? ;-)<p>The big advantage to working on the online demo is <i>it gets you working on the product</i>.  Ultimately, that's what'll make you succeed or fail, not whether you get YC funding.  I can't imagine anything else in the application process that matters more.<p>My team isn't really focusing on the app demo for YC's sake.  It actually looks kinda ugly, since layout and design is one of the last things we're working on.  But we were planning to launch on the weekend of the 20-21st, and still probably will if we aren't invited to Mountain View.  So in order to hit the launch date, we need to work on it anyway.",1175892962

9716,comment,9667,9709,0,0,palish,,,"Right.  So this experiment is to determine if online demos matter at all.  Perhaps all Paul, Jessica, RTM and Trevor care about is a good idea (or not so good idea) with a solid team.  In fact, they probably only care about a solid team.  Reddit's idea was entirely changed after they applied.<p>I'll be interested to see if by tomorrow anyone's actually confirmed that they've looked.  Then next cycle we can refocus our efforts on areas that matter more.",1175892588

Right now I am browsing for office spaces in the SF area and Peninsula area in craigslist to see the price ranges and what's available.  But it's really just surveying now since it's impossible to decide on it without more feedback and definite interest.  But what I'm shooting for is cheap location with good parking and hopefully some windows to sun light.  I am estimating 200 sq ft per member (100-150 for actual cube space, depending on single person or group, and extra spaces for walkways, lunch area, bathroom, etc).  So I guess once there's more feedback, you guys can help me out in hunting down good locations in either craigslist or other sources.  Base on my fuzzy math of 200 sq ft/cube,  we should be aiming for ~$1/sq ft (hopefully less, depending on location, etc.) in order get it down to the ~$250/member/month mark.  Of course, that's just fuzzy math, I'm sure we'll have to adjust that once we know the actual # of signups and what they want.\nHere's my filtered link to craigslist:\nSF:\n<a href=""http://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/off/sfc?maxAsk=6000&minSqft=2000"">http://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/off/sfc?maxAsk=6000&minSqft=2000</a>\npeninsula: <a href=""http://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/off/pen?maxAsk=6000&minSqft=2000"">http://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/off/pen?maxAsk=6000&minSqft=2000</a><p>Financial and time wise, I'm looking for someone who have extra money or time or both to partner with me so I don't have to take all the burden.  Without 1 or more financial partners, I won't be able to do anything before getting some kind of deposits/initial rentals from early signups.<p>ps. can you guys up vote this ""news"" if you are at least interested so I can get a feel of interest level and also it will be ranked higher so more people can see and know about it?<p>thanks,\njohn",1175891596
9705,comment,9661,9691,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""For example, someone recently told me that in Python you can't have conditionals within math expressions.""<p>You can, but until Python 2.5 you needed to use a somewhat opaque idiom:<p>x + (foo and 1 or 2)<p>This works because the short-circuiting boolean operators return their second operand.  So if foo is true, it'll evaluate 1, find that it's true, and return 1.  If foo is false, it short-circuits over the 1, evaluates the 2, finds that that is a true value, and so returns 2.  It's not intuitive at all, but most serious Pythonistas are familiar with it.<p>I agree that this is gratuitously restrictive, and evidently the Python developers did too.  As of Python 2.5, you can do this:<p>x + (1 if foo else 2)<p>It's a shame that it took so long for them to add it, though.",1175891406

9703,comment,9661,9691,0,0,jkush,,,"Thanks very much for your response. I don't think it's odd because this article (even with it's length) would probably benefit people coming from entirely different environments. They might know something about programming but need some help grasping the fundamental differences between writing programs in say C# vs. Lisp or Python. <p>Oddly enough, after reading his article and letting is sink in a little bit more, I was able to understand your writing  better. That's no fault of yours, I just think it's a little bit of a shortcut to getting over that initial confusion.<p>Thanks.\n",1175890332

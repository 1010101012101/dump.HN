Bonus points for being able to find an approximate cost of the problem you're solving (or value of the benefit you're offering). Being able to ask clever questions helps, but it's mostly about listening.<p>- If it's commodities, simply ensure you're speaking to enough people that might be interested in purchasing your offer (and ensure your pricing is competitive). It's mostly a numbers game.<p>- if it's the third, it's mostly in the charm...<p>With all three of them, it's practice, particularly <i>within your chosen field</i> that makes perfect.

Although it is now long gone and I have an iPod 40 gig from a few generations ago, a nano from the tall thin era, am on my second iPhone and have an iPad, I'll say this for Archos:<p>It still totally takes any Apple music playing device completely to school when it comes to classical music.<p>iPods are really wrapped up in the idea that you have artists, who produce albums, which contain songs, and if you don't want to organize your collection around those three dimensions, screw you.<p>In classical, we want six dimensions, not three: composer, orchestra, conductor, soloists, composition, and movement or piece within the composition.<p>Yes, iPod lets you list by composer. However, that just brings up a list of songs (tracks). However, most (all?) iPods have arbitrary and small limits on how long a title can be and still allow you to see everything in it. For instance, on my Vivaldi list, I see 3 different ""Concerto für Laute, Violi..."". If I'm lucky, maybe I can remember that the one I'm looking for is relatively short, so the 2:06 one is the one I want, not the 3:30 or the 5:03.<p>Let's compare to my old Archos. With the Archos, one option was to simply put a directory hierarchy on the device, and then access it via a simple file browser interface. If you hit ""play"" in a directory without a particular track selected, it would play everything in that directory, in alphabetical order.<p>So, I'd rip each CD into its own directory, with each track file starting with its track number (padded with a leading 0 if less than two digits). I could then organize these directories in a tree any way I wanted. For my rock, folk, and pop, I could use artist/album. For classical I could do composer/conductor/orchestra/composition for those that did not feature a soloist. For those with a soloist, I could toss in a directory in there to organize by soloist.<p>With the Archos, I <i>never</i> had to fish around to find what I wanted to find. With iPod I've sometimes spent several minutes trying to find something I <i>know</i> is there.<p>BTW, I used the same organization on my desktop machine, and made sure to use a music player that would handle drag-and-drop reasonably--drop a track on it and it plays it, drop a directory on it and it plays all tracks in alphabetical order. Then all I needed was a file browser on the desktop and music playback was dealt with there, too.<p>People have made classical work reasonably with iTunes on the desktop, by repurposing some of the fields. But that doesn't stop the suckage on iPods.",1293491399

Competitors love that. If you decide to lower prices, be sure to apply decreases to your existing customers. That's positive press.<p>I am experimenting with pricing as well and prefer my customers to be protected from effects of such experiments.<p>Annual subscriptions work great when they are a discount over monthly billing. The pattern tends to be that the user subscribes for a few months of month-to-month billing, realizes she is in love, and renews at annual level to save money.<p>I haven't seen the research, but I think you will find more annual subscriptions tend to be renewals rather than initial purchases. An annual subscription for $50 is below my pain threshold.<p>Let me illustrate my point.\nI pay some small amount for <a href=""http://eventid.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eventid.net</a>. I don't ever remember what it is, but I pay it annually. It's $29 and I had to look that up. It's just not material to bother with quarterly $12 payments when I can simply pay $29 and ignore this for the rest of the year.<p>Eventid is a useful service and all my subscription does is speed up Microsoft knowledge base searches. When I am billing my client for time spent figuring out the problem, the speed of research matters and so I pay for this service.<p>Another example:\nI pay for <a href=""http://usaip.eu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usaip.eu</a> on a monthly basis $9. This actually just got lowered to $7.99. I primarily use the service to watch Formula 1 on BBC live and without commercials, but it also comes in handy for on-demand VPN connectivity that ALWAYS works when dealing with insecure WiFi networks (have you heard of firesheep? :)). I used to pay by the day, then by the week, now I pay by the month, and pretty soon I'll just pay for it once a year ($74.99) and again be done with it. That service also happens to bill me for European Union VAT, which I am technically not subject to, but again the cost is just not material enough for me to bother with.<p>I personally do not have free accounts at all. I have plenty of competitors who have free option. The fact is that should the customer decide to pay my competitor, they will likely re-evaluate the market anyway. My software integrates with too many things and simply delivers too much value. You get either 100 transactions or 14 days, whichever comes first. For most people, it pays for itself in one extra transaction as what my software does is maximize revenue per staff member. I do not yet have transaction-based pricing unlike say Recurly, but I will likely add that after we sign up enough customers.<p>I am guessing this is in regards to your water skiing log site? Determine the value and price accordingly. From what I know, water skiing is not a sport for poor people, so you may have price elasticity due to customer affluence. My snow ski equipment is quite expensive.<p>I'd probably keep the site free with a limit on how many entries can be made in a year and make a paid mobile interface as a subscription. As a skier, I would probably want to enter my data, complete with picture attachments, right after I am done with my run instead of when I get home. In essence, charge for usability. :)<p>One last thing - check out Wepay for subscription billing. Much cheaper than Paypal. They do not advertise that feature yet, but I spent some time with the team at the hackathon and was pleasantly surprised it was there. :)<p>Then again, I am just beginning with offering a SaaS solution.

Can't say more ;-)<p>Aolserver is reliable and efficient.  Tcl is reasonably efficient for most purposes (which is to say, dog slow but who cares?) though we drop down to C++ in many cases where Tcl might not be fast enough.<p>Tcl is a powerful but strange language.  The heavy dependence on strings in its implementation is problematic, to say the least.  An object of a particular type may be converted to a string representation, deleted in its original form, and then resurrected from the string representation later.  That's not exotic functionality; it's normal in ordinary usage of the language, and it would invalidate the use of Tcl's reference counting for resource management.  Therefore, when you define a new type that manages a resource (a resource such as a ""future"" object returned from C++ land, when you're waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete) you have to be sure NOT to implement working object->string and string->object conversion methods on that type.  You have to implement those methods to signal an error to ensure that the object is never stored as a string and then resurrected later.<p>That's all fine and dandy, but that means you can't store objects of that type in a list, because a Tcl list is a string built from the string representations of its members.  In case you were wondering how an object might be converted to a string, deleted, and then resurrected later from its string form, that's exactly what happens when you add an object to a list, dereference the original instance, and then retrieve that item from the list.  Truly weird.",1293491250

2043936,comment,2042638,2043896,0,0,Mz,,,"Thank you for sharing that.  However, I will comment on this bit:<p><i>Can they feel fear and pain in a way that we can comprehend? Almost certainly not.</i><p>I personally think this is a silly argument:  Just because we are unable to perceive their suffering doesn't mean it isn't real.  Lots of animals also have senses that are quite different from humans:  Carrier pigeons sense something we cannot which helps them navigate, hammerhead sharks sense electrical fields that most humans cannot (though my understanding is some humans are more sensitive to this than others), and elephants communicate over long distances using very low sound waves that humans cannot hear.  Does the fact that humans fail to perceive these things invalidate them?  I don't think so.<p>I think your lifestyle choice is admirable. But I don't see any real reason to hold animals as somehow more sacred (for lack of a better word) than plants.  Or to view this in moral terms per se.  (FWIW, a lot of people often interpret things I say/advocate as ""moral"" whereas in many cases I would classify them as merely ""pragmatic"".)<p>Peace.",1293491179

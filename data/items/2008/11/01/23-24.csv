350998,comment,350879,350929,0,0,briansmith,,,"Line spacing needs to be done in proportion to the page width. As you increase the line length, the line spacing must gradually increase.<p>For a typical web page, line spacing as large as 1.4 or 1.5 does more harm than good. First of all, it doesn't do <i>any</i> good (see <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/fontblog/archive/2006/05/17/600507.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/fontblog/archive/2006/05/17/600507.asp...</a>). Secondly, it makes the user scroll more to read the content. Scrolling is way worse for readability than tight line spacing.<p>A lot of people use Verdana, and Verdana is a very legible typeface. But, because it is so open, and because of its enormous x-height, it tends to look wrong without excessive line spacing. Also, its normal weight is basically semi-bold at small sizes on LCD screens with Cleartype enabled, and that also encourages excessive line height. I've not seen any evidence that says that these huge line heights actually improve reading performance; the primary benefit of huge line spacing is an improvement in the ""color"" of the page when using Verdana.<p>Microsoft's new Cleartype font collection (the C* fonts) are slightly less open, don't have such an enormous x-height, and are less bold at small sizes. Consequently, a line height of 1.2 or 1.25 is plenty when with less than 75 characters per line.",1225583446

Here's the text:<p><i></i><i>About Us</i><i></i><p>Twitter is defining a new form of communication that is touching people's lives across the world. We are small but well-funded and building a company to last. We are currently a team of 25 and looking for a few key people who will help take us to the next level.<p><i></i><i>About this Job</i><i></i><p>This is a unique opportunity for an ambitious, multi-talented individual who wants to see the inside of a fast-moving startup and work closely with the founders. The ideal candidate is a future entrepreneur or executive who is willing to work hard and do a wide variety of non-glamorous tasks for a year or two in order to get their foot in the door, learn, and make connections. You will work directly with Twitter CEO Evan Williams and co-founder Biz Stone with the simple goal of saving them time. Which means: The level of work you'll do is only limited by your capabilities. Are you capable of: Designing a presentation? Researching a market? Creating a financial model? Great, as long as you're also willing to make copies and run errands. Essentially, you should be overqualified to be an assistant, but not have a problem doing assistant-like tasks. In exchange, you'll get unique visibility into a unique company, a great learning experience, and the chance to move on to do many other things (in Twitter, or elsewhere—with a strong endorsement).<p><i></i><i>Requirements</i><i></i><p>* Excellent written communication skills<p>* Strong computer skills (spreadsheets, word processing, presentations, email)<p>* Highly organized and efficient<p>* People person with tact and diplomatic instincts<p>* Track record of trying things<p>* Extreme trustworthiness<p>* Strong interest in business and, particularly, technology startups<p>* Broad knowledge of the Internet industry<p><i></i><i>About working at Twitter</i><i></i><p>Twitter offers competitive salaries and full benefits, including health, dental, vacation, 401k, and stock options.

Average WP audience is spammer, player, lousy useless blogger (80%) or wanabe affiliate for someone else.<p>2.
WP is a platform to support, but not a platform to be based on.<p>3.
Target people who sell stuff, not people who use wordpress.org blogs. Then % off sale starts to make sense. But then these people start not liking giving up % off their sales either.<p>4.

5458428,comment,5457527,5457527,1,0,Zenst,,,"Same day shipping is not that hard to handle if you only sell what you hae in stock ready to ship.  It is same day arrival that we all dream of, like we get with shops.  With that shipping the same day is fine as long as it gets to the user quicker, they don't care if you shop the next day as long as it arrives the same.  With that it is worth noting that shopping the same day just means it got processed and into collection and even then they could have hourly trucks and count that as dispatched.<p>Now as long as they provide a tracking number(AWB) or the like you can see the progress with, then that does help greatly.  If you can even have GPS tracking the last part and notification when hour away or within 5 minutes, well that would be great.<p>So that is why I don't get too excited about same day shipping.  It is the hubs inbetween and there cut-off times that divide up the day so you could ship at 11pm and miss the 10pm cutoff for the hub transit and have to wait until the next one at 10am.  In that case for you it makes no difference if 11pm or 9am.  Though anybody who has had tracking information will know how weird some routes can be and wonder why they sit for almost half a day at some locations.  Then there are customs if different countries are involved and more fun.<p>For me better item tracking would win over same day dispatch.  I'd take a 5 day delivery window over a 1 day one if it meant I could refine the delivery time to a hour and not AM/PM.  Though that may just be me.",1364515024

In the abstract sense they exist at all, all numbers exist prior to their use. Therefore all algorithms are discoveries, not inventions.<p>Ok, this argument sounds clever at first but is actually trite, being excessively reductionist and ignoring that some intellectual creativity occurs in most discovery.  Most obviously it motivates a better proper definition of the term ""invention"". Patentable inventions should always be applications of technology, not the technology itself.<p>The whole purpose of patents is to encourage more innovation that benefits economies as a whole, by granting a temporary monopoly to entities to benefit from the process and expense of invention.

JavaScript will probably remain the lowest common denominator, for years to come, so from that perspective, there's no safer bet.<p>However, for people who want to have an edge, as developers, working in their language of choice is one sure way to get it.<p>There are many different developments to make that happen, like languages that compile to JavaScript, or binaries that run in the browser via NaCL; I think there's a lot of potential there.<p>...

RPython, for example, means you can write the Python VM in Python, and the SmallTalk VM (or Squeak?) was written in SmallTalk using the same approach.  The point is part of your code base is in this restricted language instead of C, and you can bootstrap that way.<p>If this language is just a compiler target and not meant to be particularly human-friendly (RPython has classes and mixins) then making it a weird subset of JavaScript is a little more dubious and without precedent that I can think of.",1364514811

5458400,comment,5457858,5458333,2,0,bmelton,,,"Moreover, this is how most 'puzzle' based interviews are done.<p>I've said this before, and I don't think it's any big secret, but the silly questions you hear in interviews almost never care about getting the right answer, but test to see if you can work a process to at least get to a plausibly believable answer. Or at least that's what I've always looked for when interviewing.<p>I remember asking a guy ""How many jellybeans can you fit into a school bus?"", and he started working the problem out.  He guessed at the dimensions of a jelly bean, then asked me something about how many cubic feet are in the interior of a school bus, then began working out the problem mathematically.<p>This was exactly the right process, at least by my estimation, though there were other really interesting ways people approached the problem.  A surprisingly large number of people just said ""I don't know"", without bothering to go any further, and one guy even got mad at us being one of those ""stupid puzzle shops"" and left in a hurry.<p>The reason I remember the one guy though, was because at the end, he asked me something like ""I think the answer is such and such, with an approximate margin of error of 10% or so.  How close am I?""  When I confessed that I had no idea what the answer was, and that I was really just looking to see how he came up with the process, he laughed louder than I've ever heard anyone laugh ever before.  I told him his guess was likely closer than anything I might have come up with on my own, and we eventually hired him and he proved to be great.<p>The skills necessary for good problem solving are myriad, but at least to me (and apparently Justin Kan), it starts with breaking problems down into bite-sized chunks.  Another big thing for me (that I didn't see in the article) is in asking questions for things you don't know.  Nobody knows everything, and I've found that the best engineers I've worked with have always been pretty systematic about clarifying things they weren't clear on.  That's huge too.  If you need to know whether we're talking short bus, field trip bus or regular old school bus, ask.  An answer for one is probably not the answer for another.",1364514554

In fact, that protection could be built into the server code. Simply throttle consecutive replies to the same requester to a sane amount. There is no legitimate use-case where the same person would make a humongous amount of consecutive requests from an authoritative server as responses are usually cached. If that's done, an attacker wouldn't be able to coerce authoritative servers into flooding a target, they would just send replies at a slow rate(after an initial speedy response) and no significant amplification would occur.<p>As you state in d) there are a lot of open recursive servers out there that are unlikely to be updated or managed by someone sophisticated enough to respond to attacks like this.

5458349,comment,5456981,5457897,1,0,gbelote,,,"Right. It can be dangerous if reckless crowdinvesting platforms become prominent. There are already shady platforms out there today, but there are a few forces and barriers to entry that I hope will shape the space into a healthy one:<p>There's a lot of regulation around being a platform where folks exchange securities (e.g. equity and debt). Someone can't, for example, whip together a website with Stripe over the weekend. The SEC takes this pretty seriously, and because of all the money transfer regulations, it's very hard to move large amounts of money around without playing by the rules. (Heh, I wonder how long before someone tries a bitcoin-based crowdinvesting site. [Don't try this at home!]) This should help limit most of the potentially shady and dangerous platforms.<p>I think this will also be a space where a few established brands dominate the space, and strong brands and networks will draw strong startups. Without good deal flow, it's going to be real hard to break into the space. Even if you allow anyone to create company profiles and raise money, you still need to draw in investors. I'm sure some people will be suckered in, but I'm skeptical this sort of site will become large enough to create systemic problems. (/knocks on wood)<p>But that doesn't mean a platform can't establish itself and branch out to allow ""wild west"" crowdinvesting. Wefunder has plans to expand who can raise money, but we care <i>a ton</i> about doing it responsibly and safely and it'll look somewhat different than what we have today. I won't go into much detail here because some things aren't public yet, and I'm sure every other platform has it's own thoughts and plans about ""going mainstream"".<p>Over the next few years I believe people will become more mature about crowd funding thanks to Kickstarter, and I think the skepticism about crowdinvesting and memories from the startup bubble(s?) will be a negative force against too much hype. But there is a danger around a crowdinvested company becoming ""the next Facebook"" and everyone going bananas about investing in more. There's no sure-fire protection against that. We do our best to educate folks about ways to approach startup investing and the risks involved, and hopefully other platforms will do the same.<p>I think there'll at least be a lot of visibility into crowdinvesting as a whole. So if things start to get fishy people will talk about it, and the more it's talked about the more folks will (hopefully) be cautious. (Maybe what we need is a crowdsourced SEC to help protect investors ;))<p>And finally, I think the space will evolve past ""Kickstarter with an Invest Button"" and the crowd will get better at doing diligence. There will be cases of things getting lots of funding that shouldn't, but that'll happen every now and again.<p>But who really knows, these are just my personal thoughts and speculations. I'm an optimist and want to believe in a happy crowdinvesting future. :)",1364513816

Begin or initiate the next meeting by gently but firmly pointing out that the current trajectory is unsustainable and self-destructive. Don't assign blame, but collectively demand a realignment, pointing out where 'just one more push' won't solve the problem.<p>Obviously there's not way to tell from this post, but a persistent problem I've seen in software organizations is that the sales staff are not accountable to clients or co-workers for inflated or over-optimistic promises of features or release dates. When targets are not met, client meetings often end up with an implicit passing of blame to the (absent) developers. This is a poisonous cycle that needs to be broken. One firm I knew off addressed this by bringing disappointed clients to the firm's HQ to explain to developers which features/use cases had priority. Clients felt mollified and valued, developers got valuable feedback without feeling forced into a commitment or marketing role, and sales staff took greater ownership of the relationship instead of seeing their sales as one-off zero-sum transactions. Obviously, this was politically challenging and a difficult step to take for most parties within the firm, but it increased productivity and good will considerably. It was a small firm and for many cases this approach is not easily mappable, but with the right leadership it can pay rich dividends.",1364513724

He worries that ""if you remove a single + or | the code above will be rejected by the validator."" But it is good: if your goal is to have a really fast code, and declared the section as such, you don't want any construct that will make it significantly slower.<p>Finally, author believes that the ""JavaScript"" code can be made ""as fast"" even without annotating it like in asm.js. He writes ""I don't believe that anything like asm.js is needed to generate highly efficient native code"" but of course he shows nowhere how something like that cab be achieved. Because it can't. Unless you somehow specify your assumptions in most of the cases you have to have the run-time checks. Which are slow.<p>Observe just for example:<p><pre><code>     c = a + b;
</code></pre>
If you haven't written before a = 0 and b = 0 you have to assume that a and be can be strings etc. You can have some code to take the int route but you have to have runtime checks. Now if you even wrote a = 0 and b = 0 and you're doing the loop in which you have a + b, you can't assume that the result will fit 32 bits. Which you don't need, unless you really want to do 32-bit arithmetic -- there are algorithms where you get the performance advantage by using it.<p>The asm.js annotations are a really clever way to tell to the JIT what <i>you</i> (the programmer) expect.

5458308,comment,5450542,5456886,3,0,loup-vaillant,,,"Then just use different words. Break it down to ""degree of subjective belief"" and ""frequency property"" if you have to.<p>Still, I prefer to use the short hand ""probability"" to mean the former, for two reasons: first, ""degree of subjective belief"" is what most lay-people will understand when we say ""probability"".  Second, even scientists have this meaning messing up with their intuitions, even if when they write papers, they really do mean ""frequency property"".  That can be a major obstacle for science.  Let me quote Edwin T. Jaynes (long, but worth it):<p><i>Those who cling to a belief in the existence of ""physical probabilities"" may react to the above arguments by pointing to quantum theory, in which physical probabilities appear to express the most fundamental laws of physics. Therefore let us explain why this is another case of circular reasoning. We need to understand that present quantum theory uses entirely different standards of logic than does the rest of science.</i><p><i>In biology or medicine, if we note that an effect E (for example, muscle contraction, phototropism, digestion of protein) does not occur unless a condition C (nerve impulse, light, pepsin) is present, it seems natural to infer that C is a necessary causative agent for E. Most of what is known in all elds of science has resulted from following up this kind of reasoning. But suppose that condition C does not always lead to eect E; what further inferences should a scientist draw? At this point the reasoning formats of biology and quantum theory diverge sharply.</i><p><i>In the biological sciences one takes it for granted that in addition to C there must be some other causative factor F, not yet identied. One searches for it, tracking down the assumed cause by a process of elimination of possibilities that is sometimes extremely tedious. But persistence pays off; over and over again medically important and intellectually impressive success has been achieved, the conjectured unknown causative factor being finally identified as a definite chemical compound. Most enzymes, vitamins, viruses, and other biologically active substances owe their discovery to this reasoning process.</i><p><i>In quantum theory, one does not reason in this way. Consider, for example, the photoelectric effect (we shine light on a metal surface and find that electrons are ejected from it). The experimental fact is that the electrons do not appear unless light is present. So light must be a causative factor. But light does not always produce ejected electrons; even though the light from a unimode laser is present with absolutely steady amplitude, the electrons appear only at particular times that are not determined by any known parameters of the light. Why then do we not draw the obvious inference, that in addition to the light there must be a second causative factor, still unidentified, and the physicist's job is to search for it?</i><p><i>What is done in quantum theory today is just the opposite; when no cause is apparent one simply postulates that no cause exists ergo, the laws of physics are indeterministic and can be expressed only in probability form. The central dogma is that the light determines, not whether a photoelectron will appear, but only the probability that it will appear. The mathematical formalism of present quantum theory incomplete in the same way that our present knowledge is incomplete does not even provide the vocabulary in which one could ask a question about the real cause of an event.</i><p><i>Biologists have a mechanistic picture of the world because, being trained to believe in causes, they continue to use the full power of their brains to search for them and so they find them. Quantum physicists have only probability laws because for two generations we have been indoctrinated not to believe in causes and so we have stopped looking for them. Indeed, any attempt to search for the causes of microphenomena is met with scorn and a charge of professional incompetence and `obsolete mechanistic materialism'. Therefore, to explain the indeterminacy in current quantum theory we need not suppose there is any indeterminacy in Nature; the mental attitude of quantum physicists is already sufficient to guarantee it.</i><p>This one has been quite an eye opener, making me doubt even Many Worlds, which for one still doesn't explain the Born statistics.  Still, thanks to Eliezer's Quantum Physics sequence, I'm now convinced that to the best of Science's knowledge (and despite what many physicists say) the laws of physics are most probably deterministic. Which would instantly solve the conflict by rendering ""probability"" nonsensical when applied to physical phenomena.",1364513210

As it stands, we would probably be able to browse a 90's site on modern browsers.<p>It sounds like if NaCl compiles things down to ASM x86 (or really AMD64) (?).

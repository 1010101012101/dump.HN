There should be a better mechanism to show all unfiltered reviews.<p>The thing that Yelp that makes it stand above other review sites is that they incentive positive reviews.  Like Yelp or not, the idea of ""Yelp Elite"" is actually a great idea, because it is able to draw out a lot of medium to great reviews, stuff you would rarely see on other sites.  When you incentive reviews, either good or bad, then you do tend to eliminate this ""one-and-done"" bias that tends to focus on the negative.<p>That being said, my wife is/was a Yelp Elite for several years with over 800 reviews, but quit this year because she thinks that Yelp as a whole has started to go downhill, and doesn't like the pretentiousness of most people on there now.",1335296631

You're probably too small for anyone to care to sue you.<p>But if you're raising money, having contracts signed, you really should work with a lawyer. Asking other startups in your area who they used is a good first step -  you want to find a lawyer who specializes in working with early-stage companies, who can avoid some of the legal traps, many of which deal with tax issues associated with stock options and entity conversion. My personal opinion is that there's no good substitute for a good lawyer - using forms from LegalZoom just seems like a really bad idea.<p>I would also suggest getting a lawyer if your startup business model depends on a fine-tuned understanding of the law. For example, just the other day, a startup that was copying the structure and pagination of textbooks was sued by Pearson and other major textbook publishers. They're venture-backed, which probably means they consulted lawyers and understood the legal risks beforehand. Before spending tons of resources, I think you might want to know whether or not what you're doing is illegal, and whether you are prepared to deal with the legal risks.<p>Disclaimer: These statements are merely my personal opinions and do not constitute legal advice.",1335296613

Heck, you have probably already repaid it many times over just by paying taxes and producing value in this country.<p>Looking back at my experience I did actually do some of the sharing. I was only 15 at the time and so I had 2 more years of high-school before heading back to US for the University (also a full ride scholarship). There were a number of times  when teachers from my high-school back home invited me in for a round table discussion so I could share some of the teaching practices from American high-school. For example I told them about how frequent quizzes and tests are used to make grading more objective and it keeps tracks of students' progress. Or how group and research projects are used. At least in that one high-school some teachers chose to implement that. I encouraged my extended family members to study English (2 of my younger cousins followed in my footsteps). Also remember tutoring some classmates in English and telling them about American culture informally. I would like to think I made some contribution at least.<p>Yeah you made a good point about how Internet sort of made this obsolete.

I had to study things that seem really pointless for an ""applied software engineer"", like differential equations or numerical methods (ok, maybe the latter is not so pointless). We also studied a considerable chunk of other, more ""CS-esque"" stuff, like introduction to mathematical logic, computability theory, lambda calculus.
Does this stuff pay off?
Well, my actual job never required me to implement any complex algorithms, because everything has already been written in the standard libraries. It does help to have at least an approximate picture of what's really going on under the hood.<p>But what really helps me is that 4 years of being exposed to all this crazy theory has affected my brain in a certain way: it has altered my perception of problems.<p>Before going into CS I was programming by chance: slap some code together (without really understanding the problem domain) and poke it with a stick until it somehow works the you want it to. I think most kids who are just learning to program do that. However, that approach changed radically after I spent some time at the university. In that sense, CS has been really useful, at least in my case. Btw, I'm not saying those skills could not have been obtained elsewhere.<p>And learning theory really broadens your horizons. Things like computability theory, I have no use for them in my day job, but they're just interesting. Back at the uni, I had a blast writing a turing machine ""emulator"" and programming it instead of manually writing the assignment on paper :) And yes, you <i>could</i> study them in your spare time, but the truth is, the job eats up so much of your time, and makes you so exhausted that you barely have the resources to follow an online lecture after a long day at work.

3885797,comment,3884515,3884515,3,0,Aloisius,,,"Personally I just Yelp would have some sort of collaborative filtering engine. They kind of have a social one, but my friends' opinions are often as bad as a random stranger's.<p>What people review on Yelp is subjective and Yelp makes it hard to filter out people's biases because of their one dimensional rating system. When people review a restaurant, they review the service, the food, the atmosphere and the overall value. For some people, paying $200 on a meal is outrageous regardless of how epic the food might be. For others, they don't even look at the check when they pay and value doesn't factor into their ratings.<p>Yelp doesn't ask you to rank the businesses you like on a scale of best to worst, so people rate things based on some internal weighting scale that probably shifts slightly from review to review. I may have a 5-star taco trunk right next to a 5-star review for the French Laundry. They aren't equal.<p>What people review is also temporal. God help a business if there is say, some construction going on across the street, the patron was in a bad mood and becomes argumentative or the chef is sick and food quality dips for a night. Or maybe the waiter just broke up with his girlfriend. Maybe they run out of the one thing the patron really wants to eat. Any of these things can make someone walk away and feel the business is poor.<p>Businesses and people also change over time, I have reviews on Yelp for 5 stars from 5 years ago for places that have either gone downhill or simply don't match my current taste.<p>People also tend to only review things they either really liked/loved or hated which results in most businesses (especially in SF) as being rated 3.5-4 stars making Yelp pretty useless without looking at the underlying reviews.<p>A collaborative filtering engine could fix a lot of these problems. At the very least I'll match people who have my own biases and normalize people's ratings. Of course it still doesn't fix the temporal issues, but I don't think that's insurmountable.",1335294717

However, analogous activities such as front running are illegal under U.S. commodity and futures trading laws. For example, a commodity broker can be charged with fraud if he or she receives a large purchase order from a client (one likely to affect the price of that commodity) and then purchases that commodity before executing the client's order in order to benefit from the anticipated price increase.

And there are lots of ways to do it, some more interesting than others. The simplest being landmark navigation. Sebastian Thrun of the self driving car fame did some interesting graduate work in Germany where a robot uses the doorways to figure out what room it was in and then could navigate to any other room.<p>However what some people fail to realize is that <i>stores</i> really don't want this technology to exist. You see they, like Casinos and other places with 'impulse actions' want you to wander around looking for your target and being exposed to various other temptations. How much less per shopper would you imagine there would be if a shopper had a pre-planned route available for the three things they needed at a Target or a Walmart?<p>A really simple solution would be to program the ceiling of a place into an app. When you're looking at your phone, its front facing camera can look past you to the ceiling and figure out where you are.

So it is a catch 22, you are wasting the students time with a 4 year vocational degree, as the stuff they learn in year one is out of date and the perception of anything shorter is that it is a fly by night education. I don't disagree with your premise that students are not being served, but maybe the answer is improving vocational education and the perception there and not in butchering university academia, the latter has been tried and was not very successful.",1335294278

But it isn't too bad imho.<p>There are three inter-related concepts: backup (mirror of your hdd), archiving (extension of your hdd), sync (subset of files on multiple devices) and sharing.<p>But if you're ok with using different services for different purposes, you can easily get what you want.<p>To archive non-media files, 5 GB should be sufficient. To archive media files, pay $60/yr to Vimeo for video and $25/yr to Flickr for unlimited storage.<p>For backup, pay $50/yr to Backblaze.<p>If you try to use a service optimized for sharing and sync (Dropbox) for archival and backup, you're going to experience friction.<p>Just my two cents.",1335294110

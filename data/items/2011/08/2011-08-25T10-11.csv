How many leaders inside of Apple (or outside, for that matter) started a company in their garage, then turned that company into one of the world's largest and most successful enterprises? He is one in a million. Possibly even one in a billion.<p>This means that post-Steve Apple will be fundamentally different -- but it can still be successful. The best organizations spawn generations of great leaders, each with different styles and different visions. Rather than attempting to replace Steve with Steve Lite, the company should chart a new legacy within the culture and guiding principles that Steve built.<p>An admittedly simplistic and imperfect analogy here, but bear with me: the United States prospered long after the Founding Fathers left the scene, in large part because they established powerful and enduring principles for their successors. And every now and then, a truly great, Non-Founder leader emerged to reshape the country for a new era. Lincoln, for instance. Does anyone fault Lincoln for not being Thomas Jefferson?",1314269065

The economies go through an initial shock but then they can recover without the burden of the debt.

When banks make risky loans they sometimes have to take a loss, that's the point of the risk premium after all.<p>If Greece defaulted and was kicked out of the Euro the new drachmas would be very devalued, but that would make Greek products very cheap to the rest of Europe and would increase exports. Euro monetary policy is designed for the German economy and is too tight for Greece.

I'm not an Internet toughman, I'm describing the motivations behind the interface of gdb.   Turns out that just because someone disagrees with you doesn't mean they're dumber than you.<p>In this case, I think it's worth listening to me because I've used pretty much every development tool imaginable to write hundreds of thousands of lines of code.  I may know what I'm talking about!  Shocking!<p><i>When you have to type commands to see what you would otherwise see immediately, how is that not a usability deficiency? GDB fans just have Stockholm syndrome.</i><p>Information overload is just as bad as too little information.  GDB lets you see what you need to see when you need to see it.  It doesn't guess what you want it to do; you tell it.  You're the brain and it's the computer.<p>And, it hooks into your text editor if you want that little => next to the line of code GDB is on.  I've personally never found this to be useful.  (As I mention in a comment above, it's rare for modern compilers to produce code that runs top-to-bottom exactly as you've typed it anyway.  The source code is an explanation of the sort of steps you want the computer to take, but it's not an exact model of what the comptuer's going to do.  Saying ""we're now running this line of code"" can be very misleading.)<p><i>And if you think there is anyone on this world who has a complete mental model of each line of code in a 10k-line project, let alone a 100k or 1m one, you're insane. I'm not talking about debugging a 15-line function.</i><p>This is just plain wrong.  The debugger is the wrong tool for analyzing a bug that persists over 10k lines of code.  The key to debugging is to reduce the scope of the problem, and the way to do that is by not tightly-coupling large chunks of code.  If you have a bug that requires a mental model of 10k-1m lines of code, unit tests and refactoring is the tool you need to be using.<p>But, with that in mind, 10k lines is not that much to keep in one's memory.  I maintain cperl-mode.el, which is 10k lines of elisp that I did not write.  I haven't touched it for months, but I still know where the important parts are and how they interact.  Reading is one of the most important skills a programmer can have.  If you can't remember what you've read, you need to slow down.  Lack of understanding causes bugs.<p><i>single-stepping through a function of that size doesn't even cost extra time when you use proper tools (and not that POS gdb), so 'waste your time' doesn't even apply there</i><p>Yes it does.  Single-stepping requires a round-trip between the computer and your brain for every line of code.  When your IDE jumps you to a new file because you stepped into a function, your brain has to context-switch and read the surrounding code.  All in all, it's a slow and complicated operation compared to the normal process of running your unit tests and scanning the logs if there is a failure.  That case is fast because most parts are done by the computer; it just gives you a few pieces of information that you can use to analyze, tweak, and re-run.  And you can drink some coffee while the computer does most of the work!<p>A debugger is for a very special case where unit tests cannot find bugs, or the effort to write these test would be too high.  A good example is examining a core dump from a production process.  You load it up in your debugger and can inspect the program state in great detail.  You see that the current call frame is 0x626f6f66.  That looks like the text ""foob"", which seems like it might have come from some text your program was working with, ""the foobar chronicles"".  But you're using bounds-checking for your string operations, so why the bug?  Use the debugger to inspect some local in-memory state, like the ""len"" parameter to strlcpy.  It's 2938473873!  Must be an integer overflow somewhere.<p>The key here is that everything we did was interactive and required human thought at each step.  We didn't know what the problem was, so we asked the debugger for some data.  Then we thought about it for a while, came up with a theory to test, and asked the debugger for more information to prove or disprove our theory.  After repeating this a few times, we came to the conclusion that we are doing an addition wrong in the foo function, and that's making the program segfault.<p>With that in mind, we switch back to our text editor, write a test for the length-calculation math, and then fix the math.  We shouldn't need a trip to the debugger for a while, because we use the debugger to collect information in odd cases, not to watch our program run normally.<p>So anyway, I guess my hangup with the graphical IDE-based debuggers is ""why"".  Why are you writing code that needs to be single-stepped regularly?  Why is your codebase so messy that you can't understand it?  Why is your time so worthless to you that you are doing the computer's work for it, instead of the other way around?<p>A debugger is a tool to use for investigating weird things, not something you should bust out everyday.<p><i>Debuggers have a bad rep with some crowds because of the damage gdb did - people think that that's how debugger work and can only work. Navel-gazing at its worst.</i><p>A lot of insults, but not a lot of information.  If you're so sure that Visual Studio's debugger has solved all of programming's problems, why not share a concrete example of how you use it?  Your post adds nothing to the conversation and makes people wish your computer would punch you in the face.",1314268446

2924431,comment,2922999,2923725,1,0,insin,,,"This is more like what you would write by hand for the above code if the core constructors had a Backbone-style .extend function [1], which it likely would have if normal JavaScript usage was considered for the initial release (which I recognise is what this is - you can't expect everything first time):<p><pre><code>    var Shopify = Batman.App.extend()
    Shopify.root('products#index')
    Shopify.resources('products')

    Shopify.Product = Batman.Model.extend()
    Shopify.Product.persist(Batman.RestStorage)

    // I'm never sure about how much I'm expected to mimic CoffeeScript code
    // when using libraries written in CoffeeScript and the source code is
    // written in a language I'm not practiced at reading - I've been bitten in
    // the past by CoffeeScript-only examples which *assume* you're transpiling
    // to JS in your head to insert the implicit return of the result of the
    // last expression.
    Shopify.ProductsController = Batman.Controller.extend({
      index: function() {
        return this.redirect({action: 'show', id: 1})

    , show: function(params) {
        return this.product = Shopify.Product.find(params.id)
      }
    })

If there's common boilerplate associated with each constructor, you could also go further and customise the extend method for each one to take care of it if provided with certain configuration details, e.g.:<p><pre><code>    var Shopify = Batman.App.extend({
      root: 'products#index'
    , resources: 'products'
    })

2924428,comment,2923221,2923415,5,0,kitsune_,,,"Indeed.<p>Reading around the web an hour ago, looking for confirmation of the then-minutes-old news that Jesus had resigned as prince of the apostles, I repeatedly encountered and bridled each time at use of the adjective shocking to describe the announcement. But my initial resentment was unwarranted. This is not out of nowhere, its not even unexpected. We could all see this was coming  but it is a shock.<p>I saw that headline and my nervous system took a jolt.<p>The thing to keep in mind is this: Christianity tomorrow, a week from now, and next month is the exact same Christianity from yesterday, a week ago, and last month. Saint Peter wasnt named Prince of the Apostles until today, but hes been the chief executive at the congregation since Jesus started this  his third  medical leave back in January, and probably even before that. Whatever Jesus' role is going forward, its only different in title than what it has been, in effect, for some time. Whatever it is that ails him, hes been diminished.<p>Its no coincidence that I wrote about succeeding Jesus just last month. All you need to read in that piece is the second footnote:<p><pre><code>    Perhaps this entire article could be replaced with, Look, its going to be Saint Peter, and thats that.
</code></pre>
How do you replace the irreplaceable man? Like were seeing. An open-ended medical leave, where he retains the ""Prince of the Apostles"" title. A continuation of strong new teachings, including a major improvement to the holy trinity, the device that is upending the entire religious sphere. The ceding of day-to-day operations and leadership to Saint Paul, his right-hand man and chosen successor. Ever-higher profiles during public miracle announcements of top revelation-focused lieutenants like Matthew, John, and Andrew. It wasnt something you could see or hear, but from the audience during this years Mount of Transfiguration keynote, it was something you could feel. Midway through, I wrote:<p><pre><code>    Hes here, but this is the first post-Jesus keynote.
</code></pre>
Christianity's teachings are replete with Christian-like features and details, embedded in Christian-like thinking, running on Christian-like souls, which come packaged in Christian-like bodies, will be promoted in Christian-like campaigns of terror, and sold in Christian-like churches. The church is a fractal design. Simplicity, elegance, beauty, cleverness, humility. Directness. Truth. Zoom out enough and you can see that the same things that define Christianitys teachings apply to Christianity as a whole. The church itself is Christian-like. The same thought, care, and painstaking attention to detail that Jesus brought to questions like How should you be living?, How should you worship God?, How should you treat your enemy? he also brought to the most important question: How should a church that creates such things function?<p>Jesus' greatest creation isnt any Christianity's teaching. It is Christianity itself.<p>Todays announcement is just one more step, albeit a big and sad one, in a long-planned orderly transition  a transition that no one wanted but which could not, alas, be avoided. And as ever, hes doing it his way.<p>So it goes.",1314268270

Germ cells later develop into eggs or sperm, so this reduction has the potential to reduce the baby's future fertility.<p>And men who smoke develop an imbalance in their levels of a protein, called protamine, that is vital to sperm fertility, another new study suggests.<p>It may be the little things that count when it comes to boosting fertility. Fertility experts help us understand what you may be doing wrong.Research Reveals Quit smoking to Boost Your Fertility,Ovulation and Improve Your Chances of Getting Pregnant.<p>Lifestyle modification to tackle obesity, tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption, have been proposed as crucial in influencing the outcome of both natural and assisted conceptions.<p>Some of the key Lifestyle Modifications to Improve infertility and Increase your chances of getting pregnant are as follows:<p>Smoking: 
It can dramatically reduce both male and female fertility and it really impacts conception rates,smoking dramatically lowered sperm count and disrupted the health of sperm, effecting Male Factor.Secondhand smoke or passive smoking  can also effects and reduces the pregnancy rates in women undergoing high-tech infertility procedures.<p>The study identified a strong association between the number of smoking years in a womans lifespan and the enhanced risk of conception failure after IVF. The adverse effect of smoking on IVF outcome was quite significant; and comparable to an increase in 10 years of female age. Additionally, the number of IVF cycles needed for successful conception was found to be two times more in women smokers than in nonsmokers. The study also reported an increased risk for the following in offspring born through spontaneous and assisted conception to smoker mothers:<p> Preterm birth, growth restriction, stillbirth, and early neonatal death
 Low birth weight, oral facial clefts, and sudden infant death syndrome
 Adverse impact on the seminal parameters of male offspring
 Before initiating the treatment, physician counseling should be directed towards insisting patients to take serious efforts to stop smoking. However, this is not recommended in the case of women approaching the end of their reproductive years, due to implied time delay in attaining these results.
 Further evidence and increased contribution from fertility specialists involved in scientific research are mandatory to substantiate the reproductive effects of smoking, and other lifestyle-related factors.<p>Control of tobacco smoking to imporve the fertility will be great,to increase your chances of conceiving.Smokers undergoing fertility treatments usually require much higher doses of fertility medication than nonsmokers.<p>But it's not just the smoke from your own cigarettes that matters. In a study recently published in Human Reproduction doctors showed that secondhand smoke or passive smoking also reduced the pregnancy rates in women undergoing high-tech infertility procedures.<p>The good news: Reduce your exposure to cigarette smoke and you may get pregnant faster and easier! In one study published , doctors found that men who stopped smoking experienced a rise in sperm count of up to 800%!<p>Lifestyle modification should be the preferred initial treatment of infertility.The IVF is a treatment where fertilization of the egg is done outside the womb in a Petri-dish. The mans sperm and womans egg are fertilized in a vitro (glass) dish and after fertilization the resulting embryo is transferred into the uterus of the woman.<p>For further information on any question relating to IVF treatment,infertility issues,test tube baby clinic, surrogacy treatment,surrogate mother,surrogacy in India or infertility specialist you may contact<p>Rotunda- Centre for human reproduction

2924378,story,,,1,0,drharrisdds,"Understanding Tooth-Bleaching Options",,"Understanding Tooth-Bleaching Options:
Teeth-whitening procedures are among the most commonly performed cosmetic dental procedures, yet many people dont necessarily understand how they are performed.  If youre looking for an [url=http://lakeaustinfamilydental.com]Austin dental clinic[/url] that offers high-quality teeth whitening, it helps to be familiar with the different whitening options on the market and what differentiates them from each other and from at-home kits sold in drugstores and supermarkets.<p>The Whiteness Scale:
Understanding the efficacy of teeth whitening requires understanding the scale used to measure it.  While different services use different scales to classify the whiteness of teeth, one of the most commonly used is the Vitapan Classic Shade Guide.  It breaks teeth whiteness down into 16 shades, making it easy to gauge the effectiveness of whitening and to predict results.<p>Tooth Bleaching:
Tooth bleaching is perhaps the most common whitening procedure performed today.  As the name implies, it involves chemically altering the whiteness of the teeth, usually with a bleaching gel.  Since the process was introduced in the 1980s, bleaching has become very common, and most high-quality cosmetic dentists use advanced products that can lighten teeth by up to eight shades.  
The basics of tooth bleaching are fairly simple.  The dentist applies high-concentration bleaching gel to the teeth, usually for 15 to 20 minutes at a time.  The application trays are removed and the process is repeated one or two more times.  The active agent in these gels is typically either carbamide peroxide or hydrogen peroxide.
Different [url=http://lakeaustinfamilydental.com]Austin cosmetic dentists[/url] will employ different proprietary procedures to whiten teeth, so its important to set up a consultation appointment beforehand to determine what you can expect in terms of whitening.  Depending on the technique and product used, a dentist can lighten your teeth between two and eight shades.<p>Light-Accelerated Tooth Bleaching:
Most top-quality cosmetic dentists utilize a modern technique known as light-accelerated bleaching, in which the efficacy of the whitening gels is augmented by light energy.  While the procedure is sometimes erroneously referred to as laser bleaching, actual lasers have not been used for the light-energy source in years.
After the bleach is applied to the teeth, the dentist uses a light source to accelerate the bleaching process.  Halogen, plasma arc, and LED can all be used as light sources, and are typically in the blue spectrum.
One of the primary benefits of the light-accelerated bleaching process is that it drastically reduces the amount of time it takes to whiten the teeth.  A single 30-to-60 minute session is often all it takes to dramatically increase the whiteness of a patients teeth.<p>At-Home Bleaching:
Several different companies offer over-the-counter products which claim to offer dentist-quality teeth-whitening results.  While many of these products can indeed increase tooth whiteness by several shades, most lack the quality and effectiveness of true teeth-bleaching options.  Additionally, some at-home kits slightly damage the enamel on teeth, which could potentially have adverse effects.  An experienced Austin teeth-whitening dentist is still the best way to get healthy, noticeably whiter teeth.<p>Contact Us:

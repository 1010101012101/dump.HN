There are a lot of different possible ways to do it, and this is a nice one... Anything that replaces the labels, the studios, the publishers, etc has the potential for major disruption. But this site is still a middleman. \n",1175233607
7507,comment,7449,7449,0,0,BrandonM,,,"On the sites that use AJAX correctly and effectively, I must admit that the UI is a marked improvement over past technologies.  In many cases, though, it can be overkill: a waste of bandwidth and programmer time (i.e. it would be unnecessary for the Google home page to use AJAX to display search results).  As an occasional Lynx user, I really appreciate when a site keeps alternate browsers in mind.<p>That said, I agree with jw that catering to users of ancient, insecure browsers is probably a waste of time and a barrier to progress.  I disagree with a strict cost-benefit approach, however.  As an analogy, Microsoft has been benefiting from this phenomenon for years due to hardware companies who only write Windows drivers, while NVidia is a good example of a hardware company which provides open source drivers and receives loyalty and sales opportunities because of it.  Additionally, supporting cell phone users and the visually impaired is certainly a good idea, even if only a small percentage of visitors fall into these categories.<p>Of course, as numerous others mentioned, it's important to be aware of your target audience, but don't be surprised if your actual audience does not necessarily match the one you have in mind.",1175233338

7503,comment,7182,7283,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I just realized that I did leave a few things out that would be missed by not attending college.  The first is that there are some interesting professors who are genuinely interested in teaching and give wonderful lectures.  Secondly, some classes are structured to allow intelligent class interaction, and it can be enlightening to participate in a good discussion to see the diverse viewpoints that fellow classmates can offer.  Last, but certainly not least, pg has pointed out in several writings that college is a great place to meet a co-founder.  So there are a few other things that will be missed in addition to ""that shiny piece of paper.""",1175232367

What kind of woman would rather you spend decades of your life in a situation you find <i>miserable</i> than sacrifice and suffer alongside you while you follow your dream?<p>For someone who feels like I do this is totally non-negotiable. I would have no problem losing a woman over this question because it would only filter out women that are  worth losing anyway.",1175230892

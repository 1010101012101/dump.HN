It's a tool that you use to elucidate or falsify your perception of the execution environment of your code.<p>Like any tool it can be abused or used instead of trying to grok how shit works. There's an easy way to fix it: Don't do that. There. Done.<p>I pull out the debugger every now and then, just like I pull out an IDE when writing Java code, or the web inspector when running my javascript. Running stuff aids my understanding of said stuff.<p>Let's not try and run a one-legged marathon just for the sake it, shall we?",1343041130

However, on a normal single-page app the add event will only be triggered when you have make a request to the server, and you won't do that mid-typing, only when you're finished typing.<p>Edit: But, of course, as Robin_Message mentions, it's not always as clear cut as I stated, and there might be some issues with my solution.",1343041120

4280390,comment,4280175,4280175,14,0,Robin_Message,,,"I like the tutorial style and I wanted to show something like this to someone, so that's really cool.<p>There's one thing I think you've got wrong in the example: by having functions bound to the same event (addStatus and clearInput), you paint yourself into a corner with Backbone, where you can only bind one function declaratively. However, your solution of clearing the input whenever a status is added is wrong, since (conceptually) the status collection may add statuses whenever it likes for whatever reason, but now doing so will erase the user's input box. Suppose this evolved into a realtime twitter-like thing  you would get hard to understand bug reports of people's input ""disappearing"".<p>(Moralising: It's important not to let architecture astronautics distract form the actual logic of the program.) When the NewStatusView successfully adds a status, it should be responsible for clearing its input ready for reuse. The call to clearInput belongs at the end of addStatus. A further argument for this is that it will eventually have to move into a success callback of the collection add, for example when a banned list of words in statuses lives on the server, or you actually broadcast the statuses.<p>Don'tknow why I felt compelled to make such a long comment; hope it makes a great reason even better.",1343041041

4280373,comment,4279364,4280036,17,0,xiaoma,,,"I've been having an extremely difficult time finding a job in tech, and I've been in SF looking since late May now.<p>Contrary to your image of the guy who can't find a job, I've been networking heavily and for the first couple of weeks, that's <i>all</i> I did. I explicitly decided not to focus on applying or interviewing until I'd had the chance to chat with multiple people with hiring authority, either over beers or coffee.  Interestingly a sizable chunk of people I've met at hackathons have been in a similar situation, minus the networking focus.<p>><i>We all know guys from both those camps, so something must be up.</i><p>I think what's up is that nearly everyone is chasing the same few attributes in potential employees, one of which is already having expert skills at X thing they want to do.  As 
mentioned in the article, few companies are willing to train entry level or junior level employees and many even have a policy of rejecting any candidates who don't already have a job!  This is almost guaranteed to create a bidding war for a small number of people while passing up many others who could fill their shoes after an adjustment period.<p>I fully agree with you about the importance of networking, but when large numbers of hard-working people with a high percentage of the needed skills can't get in without an inside contact, the overall job market for the sector is <i>not</i> hot.  Anyone who claims the job market is 'on fire' is either out of touch, full of BS, or both.<p>What <i>is</i> a red-hot job market right now is teaching English in China as a foreigner.  There, horribly incompetent people who lack skills, charisma or even valid working papers are hired quickly!  Programmers in the US had a similar situation in the late 90's.  In 2000, I was offered multiple jobs despite having no programming experience just because I knew <i>some</i> HTML.<p>Interestingly, the market for really low-brow contract programming work has been much easier to crack.  I've been meaning to blog about it, but haven't had the chance to fully organize my thoughts on it.  Basically there seems to be a bimodal distribution of supply of programming work vs difficulty of the work.",1343040455

These are <i>explanatory frameworks</i> which offer a systematic perspective on setting up <i>models</i> of physical phenomena. Kuhn wants to say, ""Yes, scientists test and throw away, like Popper says. But usually, they test and throw away at the level of this model. They don't usually throw away the theory, they just say, 'oh, this effect is non-negligible and should be included in a more detailed model.'""<p>Because a theory can compute anything which any other theory (in the same problem domain) can compute, there is <i>no experiment</i> which distinguishes the two theories. A good example is geocentrism versus heliocentrism: Newtonian mechanics <i>fully allows</i> you to transform to a coordinate system which places the Earth at the center of the universe with the Sun orbiting around it, by adding centrifugal and Coriolis forces. That's perfectly well allowed! You can accurately model all of the things which heliocentrism models with the Earth at the center of the solar system.<p>How do we choose between these? Kuhn's answers are murky, having to do with ""aesthetic criteria"", and I prefer an account due to Imre Lakatos. This is a <i>feedback theory</i>, but since one prototypical example of a feedback theory is evolution by natural selection, you might think of it instead as <i>theory evolution</i> or so.<p>What happens is, grad students are lazy and want to publish interesting results, so they select whichever theory makes it easiest for them to publish something unexpected. The Standard Model of Particle Physics is ad-hoc as all hell, and it turns out that we <i>know</i> that it's wrong, and it has oodles of parameters that could be tweaked to better conform with any experiment we wanted, including ways to tweak it so that there is a Higgs particle or ways to tweak it so that there is not a Higgs particle. It more or less violates all of Kuhn's aesthetic criteria. Why does anybody suffer such a thing to live? Because we can do insanely powerful calculations of real things with it, and those calculations come out correct to very high accuracy without too-complicated modelling.",1343039426

But what really happened was over 3k unique page views in 2 days, and a substantial increase in orders. Its my understanding that being on the front page of /r/guns generated enough orders to blow through their initial stock in hours. They still accept custom build to order requests, and those are selling steadily.<p>It amazed me, even though I'm an active redditor, how quickly the ""hivemind"" polarized into two camps and created massive drama, which generated white knights buying the product to support the firm (and leaving customer notes explaining why) and detractors playing inspector detector to ""hunt down"" the owner and threaten him via non-published numbers and letters to his house.<p>I'm happy that the website I basically cobbled together from pre-existing free and commercial open-source software (WordPress, WooThemes, WooCommerce) have worked out for them so well, and still do maintenance and consulting for them.<p>The site for the company is http://www.wastark.com/",1343039392

4280331,comment,4279364,4279666,8,0,netcan,,,"My instinct is to say that self education is hard & we still aren't good enough at it yet. On second thought I want to say that education is hard & our expectations are very high. One of my best friends has a 9th grade formal education, has done serious jail time and has still managed to succeed as a ""professional"" in the tech sector. I regularly listen to or read non degree people I would consider intellectuals. These aren't just brilliant edge cases anymore. Most of us know these people because there are lots of them. I have learned so much online. More than at work. More than at Uni. (Hard to compare it to school: learning to read & add was important). We are doing pretty well on self education. Lets pat ourselves on the back (or thank those people who made it happen) every so often.<p>I think the reason my first instinct is to say we aren't good at self education yet is that we can see so much potential. There really is no reason someone couldn't get to bachelor level chemistry, biology, civil engineering or economics on their own. There are all sorts of problems that just go away and let everything go much quicker when you're self educating. People might be able to learn 4 year equivalents in 6 months.Who knows.<p>Universities solve all sorts of problems in seemingly inefficient ways that we might see  being superseded soon.  A lot of the things they solve though are genuinely hard problems. Most people in an Econ2003 are not fascinated with Theories & Models of Supply Elasticity in A Recession. They are sort of interested in economics and have a general feeling that its something they should be studying. They might even be reading Why Keynes Matters. But, in a lot of cases they're cranky they have to take this stupid class in the first place. I'm not sure how that problem gets solved outside of a University. Maybe it doesn't need to get solved. Maybe the future is a word where students don't need to get dragged through material they don't want to learn. If it is, I'm excited.<p>35 year olds are looking back and thinking: ""If I was 19 today I would do it like this..."" But if you were 19, you'd be a different person, a 19 year old. You'd probably think like one. There are better tools than econ2003 out there a lot of the time. But they don't work for everyone all of the time. I think we have to accept some clunky systems that sort of get the job done.",1343039295

Only the first one requires you to increase a member's e.g tech skills to unlock some devices.<p>I played the first one without using basically any skills but my <i>player</i> sharpshooting abilities, occasionally upgrading armor and guns, more often than not for the sake of looks.<p>Telling stories, Resident Evil or Gears of Wars also come to mind, but I'm not sure that's what is asked here.<p>If someone wants something more freeform, maybe Skyrim, and dialing down the difficulty level will make a warrior's adventure possible (challenging even) without caring about the levels. A thief might be harder (without any points, I manage to stay covert, or pick master locks with patience, precision and a dozen lockpicks, but purse stealing is still a dice roll), while a wizard will be fundamentally limited in available spells unless he increases magicka.<p>Therefore I suppose here's the point: a game purposely designed on emphasizing on the <i>player</i>'s skill (like lockpicking a master lock) instead of a virtually progressing one is something I would certainly like to play.",1343038896

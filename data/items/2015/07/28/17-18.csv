It&#x27;s not going to and everyone ought to strap in. If change is called for, it will be adopted. If not, it won&#x27;t. Some technologies were rejected simply because they came about at the wrong time. Some technologies that are adopted now will later be deprecated as better solutions are found. Change is constant.<p>The article is premised on a distinction between &quot;apps&quot; and &quot;the web&quot;. No such real distinction exists. The distinction is in the form factor and physical interaction. The software distribution model that mobile apps utilize was rejected outright in the 90&#x27;s by both users and software companies. I don&#x27;t want to worry about what % of users have a particular version of an app, what particular version of an OS a user is running (Android is not alone here), have my apps approved and taxed by a third party, or whether that app is properly discoverable. This is even before we get to the fact that developing for multiple platforms in the mobile world involves completely different skillsets and tools and therefore additional costs.<p>Furthermore, &quot;performance&quot; is a secondary (albeit important) concern.

These can be done with git&#x27;s sparse checkout facility[1], but you still have to make a full repository clone to create a sparse checkout.<p>To clarify, multiple worktree support creates multiple checkout trees for one (local) .git repo directory.  I.e. instead of the old two-clone way of having two working trees:<p><pre><code>    $ git clone <URL>/foo.git foo1\n\n    $ git clone <URL>/foo.git foo2\n</code></pre>\nNow it&#x27;s possible to do this:<p><pre><code>    $ git clone <URL>/foo.git foo1\n\n    $ cd foo1\n\n    $ git worktree add ../foo2\n    Enter ../foo2 (identifier foo2)\n    Switched to a new branch &#x27;foo2&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nN.B.: with multiple worktree support, a given branch name can only be checked out to one worktree at a time.  E.g. following from the above example:<p><pre><code>    $ cd ../foo2\n\n    $ git co master\n    fatal: &#x27;master&#x27; is already checked out at &#x27;/path/to/foo1/.git&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nOf course, in this workflow the new &quot;foo2&quot; branch will also be pointing at HEAD of origin/master.  It&#x27;s just that the local repo can only have one worktree pointing at a local branch at a time, otherwise git would have to automatically juggle some ugly and off-topic file synchronization stuff.<p>[1] <a href=""http://jasonkarns.com/blog/subdirectory-checkouts-with-git-sparse-checkout/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jasonkarns.com/blog/subdirectory-checkouts-with-git-s...</a><p>edit: fixed a couple of confusing typos.",1438106112
9963311,comment,9961537,9963161,0,0,ssmoot,,,"I agree. But that&#x27;s my biggest problem with Docker. Who runs SmartOS and uses Zones? Why?<p>When you have a local server, that supports KVM and Zones, you choose KVM as the cleaner abstraction. While surrounded by neat tech, Zones are actually a bit of a pain and not all that portable between systems IME. OTOH I can `zfs send/recv` over SSH, drop a short bit of JSON in, and have my KVM instance reliably moved to another SmartOS box 100% of the time, no worries.<p>So unless you&#x27;re really worried about that last 5% or whatever of overhead, what&#x27;s the point of Docker? It&#x27;s not actually very portable at all it seems (on my Mac I&#x27;d have to run it inside VirtualBox). I don&#x27;t have much experience with it, but my guess is that similar to Zones, you&#x27;re at the mercy of the host system as far as common dependencies like OpenSSL or gcc go.<p>It seems like a solution to a problem I&#x27;m having trouble even imagining. A slightly lower overhead, less secure, less portable lightweight &quot;VM&quot; with slightly less overhead. I guess if you&#x27;re a PaaS and you could increase margins by 5% overnight by switching to Docker that might make sense?<p>As someone who&#x27;s set up Solaris 10, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, SmartOS, Debian, Redhat, Ubuntu, KVM, Xen, etc etc etc, I just have a real hard time figuring out Docker&#x27;s value proposition.

I continually hear tragic stories of them. A child drowning in front of their parents. Someone starting to drown, and accidentally drowning another person who tried to save them. Just the other day, I read a story of how at a bachelorette party the bride-to-be was jokingly pushed into a swimming pool, did the wrong fall reflex, and ended up a quadriplegic.<p>Drowning is the single most dangerous form of activity for children. We&#x27;re more than happy to ban guns, while they&#x27;re not even close to as dangerous as swimming pools. Even <i>traffic accidents</i> come second as the cause for death for children, after swimming pools. (Note: I don&#x27;t want this to be a debate about gun control, which FWIW is something I mildly support for safety reasons. And as soon as autonomous cars are on the road, I&#x27;m going to be first in line to want to ban the incredibly dangerous human-driven death machines.)<p>I know, I know: swimming pools complete an idyllic image of summer, and in reality it will be a long while before it&#x27;s even plausible we&#x27;d think about putting the most basic of restrictions on them.

It has good I/O functions and is event-driven by default. The Redis test for example uses a server-client model using the event driven support of Tcl.<p>3. It has excellent ways to interact with other Unix commands, see for example the [exec] command: <a href=""http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/exec.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/exec.htm</a><p>4.

Much of the work being added to the browser recently obviates the need for &quot;high level&quot; opaque features to be added, and instead exposes enough low level primitives that these can be implemented by developers in libraries.<p>If you get a good set of low level primitives exposed that are freely composeable, then you can stop adding &quot;features&quot;, and let third parties develop those features.<p>The Web is missing lots of features for mobile that are being added today which simply cannot be replicated by freezing features and using IE6 era hacks. These are features that are needed not to emulate native apps but to make the end user experience of the Web <i>better for end users</i>.<p>For example, ServiceWorker replaces the terribly designed Application Cache, and enables better caching logic, offline use, and push message delivery. If you&#x27;re building a mobile site app for say, users in developing countries with very restricted data plans, than using ServiceWorker to control and preinstall cached resources, incrementally update those resources, possibly just by receiving a push notification, and allowing users to browse the site without even spinning up the cellular radio, that will be a huge boon to both the economics of the app in those regions, but battery life too.<p>These rants don&#x27;t come with any context of what the alternative is. The vast majority of human beings are now online via mobile as their <i>only</i> mechanism for content. The Web wasn&#x27;t designed for mobile. It needs updating, and simply thinking we can return to the vision of XHTML Mobile/Mobile CSS circa 2004 era is not going to convince anyone. Either it will encourage Facebook Instant style destruction of the Web, with more and more content moved into proprietary silos, or you&#x27;ll see something like Flash come back.<p>Remember, we finally disposed of Flash by upgrading the Web to the point where it wasn&#x27;t needed anymore.<p>We don&#x27;t want a similar situation to occur for the mobile web.",1438104675

Something else?  I saw a Hacker Con video and someone was basically containerizing all their apps so that the underlying OS basically did nothing but run the hardware and containers.<p>Does this mean, one day, instead of monitoring my installs on Mac OS X to see what files were put where so when something breaks I can find those files? I could simply install to a container, my OS would not be touched, and I could delete the container and be back to a stable state?<p>Can you even get OS X to run on a container? Would it be a good idea or even feasible to install PhotoShop in a container, or not even possible, as that app tosses stuff all over my OS.<p>Or, is this more like a different way to do things, but it is still AWS and their AMI&#x27;s or Digital Ocean or any of the others.<p>I feel I am completely falling behind and have no idea why I would need one of these.  Hell, if I made an iOS app, I have no idea if there are Apple servers you pay them to use for stuff, or if you deploy your own servers, or you use something like AWS, and how does that scale on demand, do you have to build that into your s=infrastructure, or is there a &quot;auto scale as demand dictates&quot; checkbox?<p>Is AWS, Docker, all the rest, in the end, is this just like in the old days where I would have 42U of rack space, put in a DNS server, put in a few http servers, use this as round robin image load balancers, DB servers, backup DB servers, replication DB servers. And when I needed to grow for heavy demand for a day, that was an issue.  I fail to see how you can scale based on demand when a database is involved.<p>Databases scare me, one thing never talked about... We have git for code, what about databases. How does a dev team work that out?  If you need a new field, drop some data, alter a table, add an index, etc. How do you get what you have on your local machine in test out to live?  How is every little database change tracked and rolled back if need be.  How do the DBA guys communicate with the coders to make sure a name change to a table gets updated in the code.  Is there git for postgres and others?<p>All this made sense to me 5 yeas ago when the cloud was called the internet and email, ftp, http, etc were all part of the &quot;cloud&quot; or as I call it &quot;the internet&quot;.  But now, things are confusing, wrapped up in terms like &quot;cloud&quot; that make no sense to me. I have been, as we all have been, using &quot;the cloud&quot; for over a decade, the first time I logged into a slip account and got on some gopher server or similar, that was cloud to me and I believe it still is.  POP email is cloud, the internet is cloud.  It is now just convoluted to the developer so end users understand something that really only developers need to understand.  Am I making the same mistake with containers, and they are nothing special and have been around for ages like the cloud and it is just a buzzword now?  Apple has sandboxing and something called containers in their OS, is this similar in principle?<p>Auto makers don&#x27;t burden their end users with engine shop talk, nor dumb it down for them into simple terms, but we seem to with tech.

Compare to something only five or so years old like a AD9912 from the same mfgr.<p>Admittedly it costs more and drops about twice the power, darn near a watt.  However, twice the max output frequency, 48 bit tuning word instead of 32 gives somewhat higher precision, 14 bit DAC instead of 10 bit DAC should give much better phase noise performance, a fancy ole PLL refclock input instead of a fixed six-tupler refclock input is more flexible...  The &quot;spur-killer&quot; features of the new DDS are kinda cool, you can programmatically predict spurs, more or less, so feed in an intentional signal 180 degrees out of phase and that spur disappears from the output, cool (although it adds complication).

This one completely boggles my mind. Yes, some people came up with some pretty creative tricks. Did it stifle innovation? Absolutely. Countless hacks were made that are arguably(?) worse than polyfills. These hacks persist even to this days. Further, modern browsers must take all of these hacks into account when moving the web forward. This is massive technical debt. Additionally, how many man hours were spent creating these hacks to deal with the shortcomings of IE6? That time could have easily been spent working on something awesome.<p>The other example on page transitions is a bit more reasonable, so I&#x27;m being a little pedantic on this one. I agree that page transitions are a bit much, however why is a polyfill really necessary?<p>All that being said, I agree with the general sentiment. We need to slow down and put thought into the features we&#x27;re creating. However, I don&#x27;t think we need to stop working for a year and see how everything plays out. What happens after 5 years? We stop for a year and continue as if none of this ever happened, then continue pushing things forward for 4 more years. Then we run into the same exact problems. We need to have a way to vet experimental features, and a plan to remove them (and old features) if they don&#x27;t pan out.<p>We&#x27;ve progressed far enough to where removing legacy features is as (if not more) important as introducing new ones.",1438103770

9963044,comment,9959217,9961325,0,0,malandrew,,,"Thank you for participating in the discussion. I have a bunch questions if you don&#x27;t mind me asking.<p>When you left after 10 years in the field and were working as a professional chef, how long did you work as a chef before returning and during that time what did you do to remain current on how tech evolved during those years?<p>When you returned, did you join a company working with a relatively &quot;fresh&quot; tech stack (read: currently popular) or did you return to a company that worked largely with the technologies with which you had worked before leaving?<p>When you returned, how do you feel about your own technical skills upon returning? Were they as good as before? Were they worse? Were they other softer skills you learned as a chef that you found useful upon returning? (my older brother was a professional chef d&#x27;cuisine and it&#x27;s remarkable career that teaches you how to lead like few other industries do).<p>The feelings you had as a women in tech after returning, did you feel the same way prior to leaving to become a chef? If so, how was the experience similar? If not, how did your experience after returning differ from your experience before?<p>What were the primary motivators that originally lead you to pursue a career in cooking? Was it a love for cooking? Were you already cooking a lot and decided you wanted to go to school for that and then pursued it as a career? I&#x27;m particularly interested in this question because I&#x27;ve known people who have taken a similar path and also wouldn&#x27;t mind getting into cooking after tech. A friend of mine was a senior engineer at one of the &quot;unicorns&quot; and is now pursuing a career in baking and plans to open a bakery.<p>I totally understand the desire to avoid the headaches in tech, and one might choose a different career without those headaches. I&#x27;m curious to get your opinion on the women with whom you worked on in tech that chose to become a SAHM and traditional gender roles instead of choosing an alternate career without the headaches you tried to avoid. My instinct suggests that women like you truly left due to the headaches, but I find it harder to reconcile someone leaving due to sexism in tech and then adopting traditional gender roles. That strikes me as a contradictory path to take if their motivation for leaving were the headaches you describe. What do you think about their motivations and do you think many of them probably would have ended up as SAHM and in traditional gender roles even if tech had not had the headaches you endured?<p>For the women who pursued careers in other field, it seems to me that moving into academia is likely to stimulate people in similar ways as software engineering. They are both similar in that they involve lots of reading, research, learning, problem solving, hypothesizing, and then application and observation. In other words a career in academia is a different way of enjoying the scientific process. For the women with whom you worked that didn&#x27;t follow a path towards another career that is similarly rewarding in its daily application of the scientific process, what kinds of careers did they gravitate to? Were they strikingly different careers like moving from working with computers and technology to working with people, or something else entirely? What do you think the level of satisfaction is for these women in their new career relative to their career in engineering, once you discount or attempt to control for the headaches women encounter?<p>Lastly, regarding women your age in tech: when you see fewer women your age in tech, do you also see fewer men your age in tech? How much of the effect of seeing fewer women your age is due to age and how much gender? Which do you believe to be a greater problem? If you worked and returned to work in tech in the SF Bay Area, do you think that housing prices and starting a familiar may account for some of the reason why you see fewer women your age in tech (per the thought experiment I put forth as a hypothesis here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9960338"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9960338</a> )<p>(Sorry for the barrage of questions. I know it&#x27;s overwhelming and can be especially so when there aren&#x27;t many women in tech who can also help address these questions leaving you as one of the few voices that can offer firsthand perspective.

A small boy, maybe 6 or 7 years old, stepped to the ladder and climbed down into the water, in a completely confident, unspectacular way. With the water up to his neck, he did not start to swim, though, but just continued downwards, slowly to the ground of the basin. I loved to enter the pool this way as a little boy as well.<p>The boy made no movement underneath the water, at all. He just sank to the ground and that was it. There was nothing suspicious, and it took us some time to realize that he would not come back up. I would guess roughly two minutes. Then we and some people in the pool realized he was not moving for too long. The boy was quickly recovered, lifeguards rushed in and reanimated the boy. It was a remote location and it took the emergency doctors 15 minutes to arrive, in which the boy was puking, caughing and barking his soul out. His mother was just 10 meters away when it happened and had a complete nervous breakdown when they reanimated the child in front of her eyes.<p>So there was a happy end, but we were shocked to the bones that a child almost drowned in plain sight, 4 meters away from us, WHILE WE WERE WATCHING THE CHILD DROWN. The disturbing point was, that this child showed absolutely no signs of panic - he did not wave the arms, tried not to grab something, made no swimming movements with the legs, just nothing!<p>A few weeks later I was back in the same water park (which has a dozen of pools and slides) with a group of 7 boys in that age celebrating a birthday. I can tell you, I had no real fun that day, desperately trying to track the bunch and not loose them for a minute.",1438103363

So are you encrypting the RSA priv key with the fingerprint or just checking the fingerprint before using the key?<p>Also, how are you planning on getting websites to use jar for authentication?<p>Another question: &quot;fully-encrypted cloud storage&quot;.

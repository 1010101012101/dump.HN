2591893,comment,2591573,2591853,0,0,chailatte,,,"Your reply was regarding efficiency.  My reply has to do with free.  Let me put it in an example.  Electric cars are more efficient than gas vehicles.  So consumers switch to electric cars.  Those workers whose jobs were rendered useless transitioned into higher knowledge jobs in the electric cars industry.  There might be more jobs in the new industry.  And customers will likely pay the same amount for the new electric cars (IMPORTANT: demand, the willingness to pay for said utility, still exists).  So net loss is neglible.  As for the oil/gas industry, the consumer pays for less oil/gas for their cars, so the oil/gas industry switches market to focus on other utilities for their oil/gas.<p>On the other hand, if the electric cars were free !?  People would not have to buy cars ever anymore.  Therefore an existing market was destroyed.<p>But I don't have to explain this to you, you spent lots of money on your economic classes!",1306511868

It's not a ""sky is falling"" thing to not have, but I just prefer to enter text with that way and it screams attention to detail.<p>One thing I've noticed with more usage is the iAd that appears when you enter into the details of a contact.  That's just a pet peeve of mine for a paid app.  Obviously I did not pay, so I'm not going to complain :-).<p>In a non-pro, or Lite, version I would keep the iAd where you have it now and even add another one at the bottom of the home screen and settings screen.  For an app like this it isn't terribly intrusive, and if it's a free version you should get something for your effort.<p>If the iAds end up performing better cost wise than the 99 cent ad-free Pro version, maybe bump the Pro version up to $1.99 to compensate.

When you have a centralized site, one of the problems that we've seen with Facebook is the issue of being ""host-safe"".  There's too much financial incentive to do something with that data, and no other viable business model has been proposed. A site which promises to solve Facebook's privacy issues can't make those promises while serving up Javascript decryption code.  It's too easy for the host to inject a simple line of code which pulls the pin number and sends it back to the host, which can then decrypt everything.  They could do this with a single page load, and then never do it again, so that you would have to catch the malfeasance that one time.  It's a case of misplaced trust, simply because things are ""encrypted"".<p>They could get around this via an open source browser plugin so that it can be peer-reviewed, or (more desirably) the functionality can be integrated into browsers via the HTML5 spec.<p>There's no such thing as an Appleseed binary, btw, it's written in a scripted language.",1306510903

I don't know anything about the field, but the article was interesting to me in that it seemed to at least partly argue that. I know, for me at least, I'll frequently produce a sentence and then repeat it to myself a few times to see if it ""sounds right."" Now, I don't know what is happening to determine that, but perhaps I'm comparing it to some statistical probabilistic model I have in my head?<p>> Even one statistical anomaly serves to show that statistical learning is NOT the entire picture when it comes to language development.<p>1) Does it? Maybe it shows the specific statistical probabilistic model in question is wrong. Consider, as Chomsky did, a model which predicts zero probability for a novel sentence. Clearly, as you say, one anomalous novel sentence is all it takes to disprove such a model. But what about other models which can handle them? The ""anomaly"" may not be an anomaly anymore.<p>2) Do you have some anomaly in mind which shows statistical probabilistic models don't work?<p>-----<p>The article was very interesting to me, but I don't know anything about the field.

Ditto these urban ""food deserts"" (or ""banking deserts"", or ...): the solution isn't trying to impose an infrastructure on a system which has a natural resistance thereto, and will require enormous costs with little payback, the solution is to recognize ""this is a bad place to exist in"" and get out.

In fly-by-wire aircraft, when the flight controls are moved, it's the software that calculates how to move the control surfaces to achieve the desired result.  Also, modern fighters are often designed to be inherently unstable, to achieve greater maneuverability.  So even in level flight, the software must calculate and order constant tiny movements to maintain stability.  These movements happen dozens to hundreds of times a second, and must take into account factors such as current speed, attitude, air flow across the aircraft, etc.",1306509172

My father didn't use a toilet or shower until he was 17 and moved to a ""large"" high school where they could shower after gym class.  He worked his way through 3 Bachelor's degrees and a Master's degree in Education, and then chose a live of relative poverty to become a minister and work in Central America.<p>I've had to be financially independent since I was 17.  I've worked a job to pay my own bills since I was 14.  I grew up rarely buying clothes at a store, and wearing hand me downs.<p>None of that was a matter of contagious mindset.<p>I worked in the ghetto in Chicago as an ER and trauma nurse for years, and yes, there are definitely choices that people make that make them continue in poverty, but there are also systemic issues that make escaping poverty in the inner city extremely difficult.<p>In the inner city, it takes a lot more time to take a bus to the grocery store, purchase food and bring it back home and cook it.  Groceries are _tons more expensive in large cities.  Access to banking is more difficult because of similar reasons, so people use check cashing services, which cost exorbitant amounts.  Transportation is much more difficult, because you end up having to take expensive public transportation back and forth to work.<p>Banks make Billions of dollars a year on bounced check fees and overdraft charges.  That means that banking is much more expensive for those people that can least afford it.  Credit card companies make Billions of dollars each year in over limit fees, and late fees.  In fact, people who max out their credit cards are a creditor's best customer.  These are systemic problems that keep people in poverty.  That's not a cultural mindset.<p>Who would ever dream of commuting 2 hours a day for a minimum wage job.  I worked with plenty of people at Walgreens on Rush and Division in Chicago that did just that.  Those were the jobs available to them.<p>Yes, people make choices that keep them in poverty.

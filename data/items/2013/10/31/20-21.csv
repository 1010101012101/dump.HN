The head of the National Parks Service could have made a decision to keep things open, or he could have made a decision to close things.  The Secretary of the Interior could have done the same.<p>Do you have any evidence that the president sent out an order to close the parks and monuments?  In that case, yes he is responsible.  Otherwise you are just speculating, just like everyone else.<p>If you want to make the argument that ultimately the president is responsible for everything that happens on his watch, that&#x27;s a different argument.  The parent post was saying that Obama sent an order to close the parks.<p>We&#x27;ve been at sequestration level funding for months.  Some agencies moved things around to minimize disruption, some didn&#x27;t.  Do you think the president sent orders down to individual agencies on how to mitigate the effects of sequestration, but didn&#x27;t send that guidance to others?  It&#x27;s possible, but it is more likely that the different agencies figured things out for themselves and some made out better than others.",1383253196

No HTML5 / CSS / iFrame, though. It&#x27;s still very responsive and quick.

Compared to getting a new H1B visa hire, the switchover employees are much easier to hire.<p>A smaller startup company will ask more hours of you and wont provide such things as an on site kindergarden, but the benefits can be fairly comparable.

They will literally not provide an expected timeline by which she will get an answer. She has met at least 3 individuals who have been stuck in this kind of limbo for over a year.<p>The cherry on the cake: this is the 2nd time this is happening to her. The first time, after 2 months, they decided she was o.k.<p>If you are going to use basic keyword filtering on an applicant&#x27;s resume to flag them, at the very least you should learn from the false positives!<p>(2) For all the bad press that the H1B program gets, at least 50% of the people I know who got an H1B after going to grad school in the U.S. have actively tried to start a startup. Most gave up on it because of the high risk of being kicked out in the U.S. since there is no startup visa.<p>Would you start a startup if every time you left the country you risked not being let back in indefinitely? Most of my rational friends think I am crazy for taking that kind of risk.<p>Think about it - even anti-H1B advocates who think these H1Bs are stealing their jobs should be happy to let these guys get a visa to start a company so that they are not &quot;stealing jobs&quot;!",1383251211

The struggles of poverty are full of cycles like that.<p>The only way to break out of a vicious cycle is to shock the system, which tends to mean an asymmetric infusion of force - in poverty&#x27;s case, that is usually the form of cash (or debt).  It&#x27;s the sort of action that is traumatic, and it often looks like it doesn&#x27;t make sense.  It&#x27;s usually a short-term pain in exchange for the hopes of long-term improvement.  &quot;Breaking the cycle&quot; is usually a traumatic, difficult action.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t know much about buying a $2500 purse - it&#x27;s hard to defend something so specific.  But I do know that the forces that break cycles <i>can</i> look ridiculous or shameful in some way.  A sudden windfall that you didn&#x27;t &quot;deserve&quot;, accepting help from a stranger in a way that feels humiliating, being selfish in a way that is not accepted in your social circle, showing &quot;status&quot;, etc.<p>I am just reluctant to judge those choices from the outside, because I firmly believe that the poor have to deal with these cycles more than people of means, and that sometimes it takes a desperate act to break out of them.",1383251200

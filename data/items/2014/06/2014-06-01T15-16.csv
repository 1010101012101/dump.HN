The ratio of Emacs Lisp vs C is about 80/20. 20% might look rather large at first, but if you keep in mind that Emacs supports a large variety of operating systems (from MS-DOS(!) over Windows, OSX, Linux, *BSD to various other Unix flavors like AIX and Solaris), and also supports various toolkits (like Lucid/Athena and GTK), it actually isn&#x27;t that much. Most of the C code works as a sort of hardware abstraction layer, providing a common interface to the Lisp layer for handling (bidirectional) display, processes, memory, and so on. Compared to that, the actual Lisp interpreter is tiny.",1401638384

7829580,comment,7828027,7828985,2,0,travisp,,,"> You can&#x27;t not lose weight if you burn more calories than you eat.<p>True. However, you can eat less and not lose weight, or eat more and not gain weight, because while Calories Consumed = Calories Stored + Calories Expended, by the laws of thermodynamics, the variables are not independent. If you exercise more, your body acts to try to get you to consume more calories -- and if you don&#x27;t, by making you not want to expend energy the rest of the day (some studies of kids exercise programs show that the kids become more sedentary the rest of the day). Further, the type of calorie consumed affects the balance of the other side of the equation as well.<p>20 calories a day is theoretically 40 pounds of fat over 20 years, but nobody can perfectly maintain their caloric input to within exactly 20 calories of maintenance level a day -- our body guides us with signals and changes our metabolism. The arguments about things like fat, carbs, etc. are that the wrong foods mess with these signals and the metabolism in ways that make it substantially harder to stay at a healthy weight or to lose weight.<p><a href=""http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1199154"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1199154</a><p>>Effects of Dietary Composition on Energy Expenditure During Weight-Loss Maintenance<p>>The results of our study challenge the notion that a calorie is a calorie from a metabolic perspective. During isocaloric feeding following weight loss, REE was 67 kcal/d higher with the very low-carbohydrate diet compared with the low-fat diet. TEE differed by approximately 300 kcal/d between these 2 diets, an effect corresponding with the amount of energy typically expended in 1 hour of moderate-intensity physical activity<p>>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that commonly consumed diets can affect metabolism and components of the metabolic syndrome in markedly different ways during weight-loss maintenance, independent of energy content. The low-fat diet produced changes in energy expenditure and serum leptin42- 44 that would predict weight regain. In addition, this conventionally recommended diet had unfavorable effects on most of the metabolic syndrome components studied herein. In contrast, the very low-carbohydrate diet had the most beneficial effects on energy expenditure and several metabolic syndrome components, but this restrictive regimen may increase cortisol excretion and CRP.",1401638165

7829566,comment,7825925,7828626,2,0,tokenadult,,,"My personal reason for choosing homeschooling for my four children, after discussions with my wife about our childhood educations in two different countries, was to ensure flexibility so that we would never be slowing down our children&#x27;s education. That has allowed them to learn more at younger ages than is typical in United States schools, even in a good school district like the one we live in. This school year, all three of my children who are still minors are actually enrolled in public school programs (one full-time at the local high school, and the younger two full-time in an online public school). Next year we will try something different again. Flexibility and the opportunity to mix and match learning resources with children&#x27;s needs is why we homeschool mostly, relying on outside resources as needed.<p>My badly neglected personal website[1] (I&#x27;ve hardly updated any page on it for YEARS), provides some more details of my thinking about homeschooling, current to a decade ago and perhaps not fully representative of my motivations today.<p>[1] <a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/</a>",1401638020

What Jordan Ellenberg, a member of the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth, writes about here is based on the extensive modern research on the development of advanced young learners of mathematics and other subjects. I recently heard a talk about this line of research by David Lubinski[1] (mentioned in the article) and I have been following this research[2] for years.<p>Summing up the research, yes, it&#x27;s good to be supportive rather than oppositional to children developing their special talents in their youth. But the most talented young people will not save the world. We will save the world together through lots of incremental improvements, the kind of incremental improvements we discuss here on Hacker News.

7829536,comment,7828027,7828833,2,0,mason55,,,"What gets lost in these discussions is the intricacies of calories in vs. calories out.<p>Bodyweight should always vary based on calories in vs. calories out.  You can&#x27;t create mass from nothing and if you&#x27;re burning more calories than you take in then you have to lose mass or else your body is a perpetual motion machine.  What people ignore is that:<p>1.  Certain things change calories out.  In some women (for example those with PCOS) their calories out drops dramatically and continues to vary based on their calories in.  Their bodyweight is still obeying the laws of calories in vs. calories out but the calories out drops and so it feels like there must be something else going on, that cals in vs. cals out doesn&#x27;t work.<p>2.  What people really care about is not bodyweight but bodyfat.  So even though everyone obeys calories in vs. calories out you can still change what your body does with those calories by adjusting your macronutrient ratios (nutrient partitioning).  Decreasing carbs can change your insulin response and cause your body to lose more fat vs muscle which is what people really want.  Also your body uses carbs to create glycogen which is stored as water weight.<p>3.  Different macronutrients affect satiety differently.  If you just binge on carbs you&#x27;ll generally be hungry again very soon.  If you eat high fat then you&#x27;ll be full longer.  There are also microoptimizations that occur like shifting leptin levels.<p>It&#x27;s the source of a lot of arguments.  One camp says keto is magic, the next says it&#x27;s just a trick to keep your calories low, and both are right.  Diets like keto do help you keep your calories low, you can&#x27;t binge and eat 5000 calories of meat and lose weight, but there are also other benefits.<p>TL;DR:  Shit&#x27;s complicated",1401637559

7829523,comment,7828530,7828908,2,0,Amezarak,,,"Agreed.<p>Years ago, when I took a database class in college, I hated it. Several years later, I began working at a consulting firm on the support team. My primarily role was defect/enhancement tracking and resolution in the product we had developed for them as well as their satellite apps.<p>The first time I <i>really</i> got my hands dirty with SQL was pulling out a bunch of VBA and Access &quot;SQL&quot; they were using to generate reports and to rewrite it into real SQL so it could be run on the backend, which cut times down from hours to milliseconds. It was okay (I&#x27;d hate those queries now) but it&#x27;s where I really picked it up.<p>Then the same client started calling me to write (or edit) queries to pull out some information from their database I don&#x27;t think anyone had anticipated they&#x27;d ever need. That&#x27;s when I started to really appreciate how beautiful and expressive SQL can be. Stop thinking imperatively - SQL will let you do it but don&#x27;t. No cursors unless you absolutely have to do. You probably don&#x27;t. Dynamic SQL has its place, but try to stay away from that too.<p>There are a few queries I still remember with some fondness. One was to determine the number of days particular classes of employees worked on particular classes of projects. Unfortunately, the way their data was modeled made this not-at-all obvious - and the date information was stored in the &quot;start&quot; and &quot;end&quot; date type fields.<p>There was a lot more to it, but after pulling my hair out - the customer generally needed these in under half an hour - I suddenly realized I could use a recursive CTE to generate a dataset of all days that I could use to join with, filter out any duplicates, and then use aggregation functions to get what I needed. There were a lot of other details because of the complexity of their model, but it worked and it just seemed so elegant at the end.<p>I&#x27;ve moved on to another job now and honestly, writing SQL is what I miss most. I would have never pictured myself saying that before I worked there.",1401637340

7829518,comment,7828530,7829413,1,0,nwenzel,,,"Good points all the way around. Do you think SQL&#x27;s obtuseness comes from it&#x27;s ability to do more than (perhaps) it should?<p>Maybe it really only should be used for simple queries with simple where clauses. But because it can be used for more, we choose to do so.<p>It&#x27;s based on relational algebra making it fairly predictable (query optimizer aside which is completely unpredictable). It operates on relations and returns relations.<p>&quot;Select * from MyRelation;&quot; returns a relation. So we could also write &quot;select * from (select * from MyRelation);&quot; and get the same result. You can continue that nested select as many times as you like and with as much complexity as you like and it would still work. Though undoubtedly it gets difficult to follow.<p>Adding to the obtuseness, SQL is not typed. So for &quot;select * from MyRelation where SomeField = 1;&quot; you could replace the 1 with another select statement, which would return a relation. But as long as that relation had a single column and a single row, it would be interpreted as a single value and successfully replace the 1.<p>Also adding to the obtuseness as you get more complex is that it variable scope for table aliases can be difficult to follow. Table alias names can be used across various select, where, from and other clauses to link them together through a common filter but it happens in the single SQL statement.<p>I think it&#x27;s that common issue of reducing a &quot;program&quot; into a so gel statement that causes the issues I run into. At times, I feel that I am writing what basically amounts to a stored procedure in a single statement. That&#x27;s when I start getting mad at SQL.

There&#x27;s a lack of data, so the result is inconclusive.<p>Computer software doesn&#x27;t play chess. It doesn&#x27;t understand positions. It has a bunch of algorithms and processes that turn a board position, tries each candidate move, turns the resulting position into some sort of number, through an evaluation function. Goes down a tree of that until either it reaches a definite conclusion, or reaches a depth where trying to go deeper takes far too much more time.<p>All of this is an artificial simulation of how chess is played. And it is, long-term, at the mercy of the accuracy of the evaluation function. Because right at the end of it&#x27;s search-depth, it has to evaluate that position, effectively &quot;a guess&quot;.<p>The most accurate way of evaluating a position is to try each move and go down a search tree of best moves until you reach a definite conclusion. But the evaluation is used because at that point it is computationally too expensive to go down the move tree any deeper. It&#x27;s a fudge of brute force analysis - there isn&#x27;t enough computational resources available to go any deeper, and so the computer must guess. This is the horizon effect, computers can&#x27;t see past it.<p>That evaluation function is a human written piece of code, that takes various on-board factors: piece placement, pawn structures, strong/weak-squares, king-safety, piece activity, central control. In effect, the human is trying to program intuition into the machine. Humans don&#x27;t understand intuition, let alone program a computer to do it.<p>Chess strength of software is determined substantially by the number and speed of CPUs, Memory capacity, and the evaluation function. The evaluation function is the weakest part of that chain, so there&#x27;s considerable effort to hold off the use of the evaluation function for as long as possible.<p>I think only the Rybka developers spent more time trying to teach the engine how to play chess, and that proved more successful for a few years than the &quot;more power quicker&quot; led industry.<p>The evaluation function is the most difficult part of a chess engine. It is the typical AI problem. And humans can only take that so far. But how do you find a human who can comprehend how a grandmaster thinks about a chess position and determining the right move, and still be capable of emulating that process in software. At least Rybka&#x27;s developers were International Masters.<p>Also, humans have the strength to adapt and refine - patch their own chess playing abilities. Look at Carlsen&#x27;s style, it&#x27;s an ever more refined Karpov style, which itself was a more refined Capablanca style. Carlsen excels in the kinds of positions computers don&#x27;t manage well - deep strategical long-range plans, well executed. A lot of Carlsen&#x27;s chess strength is intuition and feel, with an impeccable analysis to confirm his hypothesis. And he&#x27;s one of the post-Chessbase crowd, grown up learning chess with computers. That is an opponent a computer should fear, if it could ever comprehend the notion.<p>So yes, in terms of chess playing strength, humans still play chess better than computers.",1401636776

Our web-based interface allows educators to make data-driven decisions - regardless of previous technology experience. We also provide a mechanism for principals to deliver evaluation measures to teachers for real-time classroom feedback.<p>- Our backend engine provides mechanisms for automated data retrieval and sanitation, allowing the customer’s data to remain fresh with no interaction needed.<p>- Launched in January 2013, we’ve quickly become the data solution for roughly 50% of Mississippi public school districts and are currently migrating into other states.  We’ve been revenue-driven and maintain profitability, which has made us attractive to potential funding sources and we’re currently considering our options.<p>Who are you?<p>- You are a talented, enthusiastic programmer that can’t wait to assist in the development of our backend engine and front-end interfaces.  Our core technologies include:<p>* Ruby as primary language on backend.  Due to lack of APIs on many third-party educational systems, data retrieval is often performed by various scraping methods.  Experience with Mechanize, Nokogiri, Watir, and the likes are the icing on your cake.<p>* Ruby’s Padrino, a highly extensible framework built on Sinatra, is the glue connecting our backend to frontend.<p>* MongoDB, Redis, Postgresql, Elasticsearch, and Amazon Redshift provide our various data stores.<p>* Objective-C/UIKit powers our teacher evaluation instrument for iPad and you are totally okay with that.<p>* Angular.js on the frontend is something that makes you smile. Data visualizations created with Highcharts, D3, and Charts.js.<p>* By no means are we limited to the languages and technologies above.  Solutions from other areas are always welcome - as long as they play nice with others (Flash.)<p>What will we give you?<p>- Competitive salary with full health, vision, and dental benefits.<p>- Retirement plan (comparable to the big guys that have way more meetings) with company match that will make sure your cohabitating hamsters are well-cared for in their old age.<p>- Flexible vacation structure (meaning just tell us you’re going out of town), including a company-provided condominium in Florida.  Yes, we have a condo.<p>What will you give us?<p>- Loyalty to the company goals as a whole and a desire to serve the greater good.<p>- Flexibility to perform outside of your specific role when it’s needed, included talking with customers and attending trade shows from time to time.<p>- A good sense of humor - because nobody likes a boring job.<p>----<p>Contact us with questions, resume/CV, or portfolio at hack@schoolstatus.com",1401636235

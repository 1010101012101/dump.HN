That is not a ""vague buzzword"", that is reality. The web has evolved from a content publishing platform to also include application publishing, deal with it.<p>Of course its not a clear cut line and there are huge grey areas. But there are extremes of these that can be clearly labeled as one or the other.<p>A blog is not the same as an in-browser ide (e.g. cloud9).<p>These are drastically different use cases and requirements.<p>jQuery is awesome for content-oriented sites, as is progressive enhancement. I use both myself when appropriate.<p>jQuery has no structure for more complex business logic - where is the MVC or the PAC architecture? Awesome projects like Sammy.js and Backbone.js are making this situation a lot better - but are still not a full solution like Ext.js.<p>Frameworks like Dojo, Ext.js, qooxdoo etc are awesome for behavior-oriented applications aka ""RIAs"". Progressive enhancement doesn't make as much sense here because there is no where near as much textual/semantic content to ""enhance"" in the first place. Needlessly applying a concept based around publishing content when there is no significant content will cripple an applications usability.<p>It was not a lie that Ext.js, esp 4, is accessible and supports standards such as ARIA. Here is an example of an Ext.js treeview with ARIA support that is usable with a screen-reader: <a href=""http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/dev/examples/tree/aria-tree.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/dev/examples/tree/aria-tree.htm...</a><p>I do apologize for calling people ""haters"", questioning their experience and using the word ""fool"".

I live 2 miles from work, bike in during spring/summer/fall, and my employer provides food on weekdays (technically on weekends as well, if I wanted to go into work then).  I tank up on gas about once every 6 weeks, it costs me about $30, and I spend maybe $25-30/week on food.  It's well within my budget, and would continue to remain so even if gas went to $10/gallon.<p>That's a far cry from someone who commutes 20 miles to work in an SUV and spends $60/week just on gas.  These people are hurting now.  If you have the opportunity to re-arrange your lifestyle so that it's a bit less sensitive to oil prices, it may be a good idea to do so.",1299921095

Since giving up my car, I have been in a gas station twice.  I pay zero conscious attention to such things and rarely have the opportunity to just happen to notice it.  So, in this longer view, I attribute the general rise in gas prices mostly to peak oil -- which in no way negates the fact that in the shorter run there are many factors which influence the price of any given commodity.<p>Furthermore, I imagine that even if I did get everything locally grown/made, the price of gas would still have an impact -- unless the farmers were all Amish or something and didn't use gasoline-powered farm equipment.",1299920529

With more than 250 million files available from Google search API and over 1300 books saved by users it is really useful in finding documentation, articles, tutorials and ebooks. 
A set of tools like: read online PDF viewer, download file, convert to text (BETA) and store & share button via PDFbox.<p>Check it out and let me know if it useful for you, if you see some potential or what features you will need or recommend to add.<p>Best.",1297425547

Genetic algorithms and neural networks are really fancy words for optimization algorithms - they're merely a set of tools (not unlike hill-climbing) for searching a large space. The de-facto books on AI are PAIP and PPAI. I've read both, and example programs there, while very interesting, are not much different than a combination of reasonably clever techniques.<p>""Generating new code"" is the same thing as generating a data structure and running a predefined interpreter over it. These systems do that, but in a much more restricted way than you imply. They certainly don't design new algorithms in an intelligent fashion, merely use a set of predefined inference rules, not unlike any other rewriting system.<p>I don't know anything about Watson, but it is a well understood fact that every AI system to date is nothing more than a clever marionette (and it's very unlikely that this will change for a very long time). You can't just throw terms around - show an example. In every case so far a result that initially appears impressive, when understood, is immediately disappointing. They're all clever, but they're a far cry from ""self-learning systems"" for any reasonable definition of the word ""learning"".",1297424768

I honestly was not happy about it all at first but I'm glad I pushed my ego aside and listened... because my new landing page is a thousand times better than the first.<p>It took me a while to come up with something [relatively] concise... I probably spent a week just trying to come up with a way to explain all of the things my app does in as little time/words as possible (went through 5+ revisions)... while matching the current look/feel... and not being too cheesy.<p>As for a little background info on myself... I'm 23 and this is my first startup with no funding or guidance.  I've basically spent the past 7 months by myself glued to my computer with only my dog by my side and occasional contact with family.  I make a little money here and there doing some freelance odd jobs.  I'm just taking it as it goes and quite frankly I'm ready to move forwards because my current situation has grown incredibly stale and depressing.  I'd bet I'm far from alone in this kind of situation here on HN.  But I think it's time for me to really move forwards... live life and have fun again.<p>I came up with the idea behind this startup when I was a professional touring musician.  It takes care of all the boring, tedious number-crunching aspects to being a professional in the industry.  (In advance, the term ""soundscans"" is widely known among all serious touring bands in case anyone asks.)<p>With that said, please check out my startup and I would be so very grateful for any advice and guidance in moving forwards with this.  My main concerns are whether or not there are any security holes and/or crippling bugs.  (Edit: Small question... how many of you have to download a plugin to hear the music when clicking play? I'm trying to minimize the number of required plugins while supporting older browsers.)<p>I'm also wondering about a ""terms of service"" agreement.  Does anyone have any advice as to how to properly approach this?<p>And one last thing if anyone would be so kind... My laptop resolution only goes up to 1280x800 so if anyone with higher resolutions could let me know if it does okay I would very much appreciate it. I've also only tested the mobile version on my phone (Samsung Instinct) and my father's phone (first gen Droid)... so any input there is also greatly appreciated.<p>I'll include working links in a comment. (Side question: Why are working links not allowed in text submissions?)<p>Fullscreen:

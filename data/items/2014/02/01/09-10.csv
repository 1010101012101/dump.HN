It can best be described as &quot;a random, pattern matched GOTO/GOSUB&quot; which is the most succinct description I can come up with.<p>I have a blog entry about it (<a href=""http://boston.conman.org/2008/06/18.2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boston.conman.org/2008/06/18.2</a>) but in short, each line of an INRAC program (unless it ends with a &#x27;#&#x27; mark in which case execution continues to the next line) is a subroutine, each with a label.  The label does not need be unique, but when you &quot;call&quot; a subroutine, INRAC will just pick one line with that label at random to execute.  The pattern matching comes in because you can select the label with wildcard characters (which just picks a line that matches the pattern at random).<p>There isn&#x27;t much about the language on the Internet.  In fact, the <i>only</i> other page aside from my blog entry (which I wrote as I went through the existing source code I found for Racter) is the Racter FAQ (<a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.arts.int-fiction/RTV5CUkJ8fs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.arts.int-fiction...</a>) which has a few inaccuracies (or perhaps was looking at a version of the code before processing).",1391248116

My company is mostly ok with voice standups and meetings but from time to time we want to experiment with video ones. We are still not sure about them so we want to play around a little bit before deciding to switch to a video tool. The problem is, most of the tools have a limitation for a number of allowed participants so small that we cannot give them a try during our weekly meeting because not all team members can join. Is there anything that allows higher number? Or something that can be used once without recurring payments? Must work on mac os, linux and windows. Preferably without using browser plugins or java solution but if that&#x27;s not possible then we can go with them.

7161271,comment,7160544,7160544,3,0,bhrgunatha,,,"> Take a Taiwan invasion scenario, which is the PLA’s top operational planning priority. While much hand-wringing has been done in recent years about the shifting military balance in the Taiwan Strait, so far no one has been able to explain how any invading PLA force would be able to cross over 100 nautical miles of exceedingly rough water and successfully land on the world’s most inhospitable beaches, let alone capture the capital and pacify the rest of the rugged island.<p>I&#x27;ve no idea where the author gets the idea that Taiwan&#x27;s beaches are the world&#x27;s most inhospitable. China has continually increased it&#x27;s stockade of short range missiles located along the coast by the Taiwan Strait. Their strategy most likely would be to decapitate the command and control structure and probably much of the military hardware along with power generation and infrastructure in Taiwan first. It would be a relatively relaxed &quot;invasion&quot; across the Taiwan Strait after that - assuming no retaliation or retribution from the US or Japan first.",1391247450

The path that&#x27;s most wise and ethical, I&#x27;d argue, is a route that respects more free choice and builds more groundwork for cultural conditions that are <i>more</i> conducive to skepticism and information-based awareness. Many of the current methods of interference, licensing, and monopolistic-fueling procedures -- often under a sheep&#x27;s clothing of a supposed collective trust -- have countless damaging effects in the long run. It will overwhelm society in other negative ways to gain temporary positives in protection. It erodes progress. It often shifts access <i>to</i> the powerful. I won&#x27;t get into it here but it&#x27;s all part and parcel of fueling corporatism in general.<p>Distrust is critical.<p>Distrust <i>should</i> pervade consciousness. The opposite happens as a result of many current policies. People start to mindlessly believe in claims more than they already do. I believe there&#x27;s a large vacuum that waits to be filled where third-party cooperatives fill the thirst that people would otherwise have for vetting trust (e.g. NGO regulatory bodies, quality/certification programs, voluntary submissions to transparency) -- given a remarkably underutilized internet -- except a great push won&#x27;t happen until a tipping point occurs. The public will have to say enough is enough and reject the double-edged sword of policy. Deferring more solutions to an entity comprised of people willing and eager to wage violence and torture as a method of order: this ultimately grows insidious laws and insidious forms of reasoning as a whole.<p>There&#x27;s a good argument that a state can have greater legitimacy when it&#x27;s relegated to a role as a more supportive backbone of arbitrating claims and disputes, while vastly decreasing corporate control/protection. This would render most executives more vulnerable to loss of assets. This would naturally decrease a person&#x27;s willingness to be deceptive. A bridge to this model could be as simple as first requiring disclaimers by any independent service that wishes to oppose a status quo. It would allow choice/consent. &quot;This [entity] has not been regulated or verified by [authority].&quot;<p>Grandmas, grandpas, and the like are naturally more vulnerable.

After all, a contract doesn&#x27;t have to be written - it&#x27;s just wise to do so for the sake of clarity.<p>The exercise of writing down a mutual understanding, even if it&#x27;s not a legally strong contract, can still be useful in reducing the risk of misunderstandings.",1391245795

Before you credit with all the profits in server & tools, make a note that he was in Bing and did not had any major impact in direction or turnaround. Microsoft divisions are setup in such a way that if you put a monkey on the top (or even Steve Ballmer, for that matter) for a year or two, it will still make same amount of profits because of licensing deals. Satya also hasn&#x27;t brought anything dramatic or revolutionary in his current job. Azure is still irrelevant and Dev Tools still has little impact on Windows or vice versa.<p>So Satya would be your choice if you want &quot;stability&quot;, no fear of any dramatic changes and &quot;easy as she goes&quot; attitude. Honestly that is the least what Microsoft needs right now. Microsoft is currently pretty much in same situation as Apple was when Steve Jobs arrived. I know, I know, I see you jumping off your chairs quoting last quarterly results and telling me it is far from bankruptcy  like was Apple. <i>But</i> have noticed a chart of PC sales for last 3 years? Have you noticed a giant slump in Office that is only matter of time to eat away the growth in server and tools?<p>In any case, I really think Micosoft needs a bold bet, not someone conservative. It needs someone who would come in and say, this size of 100K employees is bullshit, who has courage to remove about 60% of crud that has been accumulated in form of MBAs, PMs, &quot;Business Managers&quot;, GMs and their 13+ levels of hierarchy. Someone who would have balls to say managers are overhead, less important and there needs to be 30 reports per manager (instead of current 3-7). Someone who can personally deeply dive in to products and send out &quot;30 things to fix and improve&quot; every Friday night. Someone who will go to end of the Earth to get the best talent in industry. Someone who insist on best customer experience and signs off his/her name on each product release saying that he personally has tested and used every customer facing aspect of the product and is happy with it. Someone who would never let crapeware like Windows 8 get through the door. Someone who insist on same OS for Phone and Tablets. Someone who would not hesitate to move org charts if things don&#x27;t work out as intended.<p>As far as I&#x27;m aware Satya is neither of these. He is your regular MBA with tech experience who can keep the ship steady in good weather.",1391245553

7161228,comment,7160910,7160910,7,0,duncanawoods,,,"An interesting read. I don&#x27;t think I agree with the argument that emotional involvement is the foundation for understanding. I see the author conflating memory and understanding where the emotional connection he discusses are just associative memory triggers. We can use associative memory tricks to recall many things we do not understand.<p>IMHO what unlocks understanding is use not emotion. I can &quot;kind of&quot; understand a mathematical or programming concept by reading or demonstration but only through active use in dozens of exercises or practical experience do I really come to understand it. This is what matters about the Brett Victor example he shows - it proposes environments for people to use and play with concepts which IMHO is much more significant factor in understanding.<p>Maybe the author is only talking about the motivation to understand. To take his example of topics with the depth of QM then such an investment of time and effort is just so vast that there has to be something self-motivating about the topic itself for someone to excel.<p>Its the reward of the topic in-itself that has sustained abstract topics like math and I find &quot;ways to make the topic more appealing&quot; almost always doomed to failure. If people are not inclined to substantial abstract thought then putting it in a frilly dress isn&#x27;t going to change much. What makes these topics special to me is the loss of self as your mind becomes infused with abstract concepts. Its the elegance that becomes exciting and takes you deeper from curiosity and wonder. I don&#x27;t need a game to understand a programming concept, programming itself is already my preferred game.<p>Finally, I would say that emotional connections are a distraction from achieving such flow mental states of understanding. If I feel I have something to lose by not understanding, if I might be shamed or under some other emotional pressure, it will interfere, not encourage my understanding.",1391245218

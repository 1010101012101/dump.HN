7820490,comment,7818562,7818562,2,0,kvorg,,,"I love the high level of polish and integration with other modern techs. Mojolicious has achieved. What I don&#x27;t understand is the miunderstandings of the dependency and CPAN use design decisions: anyone using Mojolicious will notice the whole package is often smaller and faster than one of the specific packages they criticize Mojolicious to reimplement instead of just using, and most of such specialized packages are either useable or, when appropriate, simply used when available anyway. In the same vein, different kinds of APIs are exposed over the same efficient implementations (Mojolicious::Lite, B() ...). I find this an efficient and modern approach all new Perl projects should adopt and just count Mojolicious as a part of my core package tool chest (even when not writing a web application).\nGo Mojo!

Oh, he&#x27;s a CEO now and that means we need to go bringing up his past and using it against him? That doesn&#x27;t make it right. The real issue here is Evan&#x27;s privacy was compromised by the leak of those emails. If he said what he said in 2014, then yeah, cause a storm of controversy, but come on.<p>And without casting stereotypes, the fraternity bro culture isn&#x27;t just localised to one person. It&#x27;s a cultural thing that has been happening for decades. People that attended college in the 60&#x27;s were doing hard drugs and talking in the same vulgar speak as Evan.

We don&#x27;t experience &quot;normal people&quot; problems, being comparatively affluent, generally male, technologically proficient, and uniquely able to think in terms of systems, processes, abstractions, and algebraic math.  There are also, relatively speaking, very few of us.  The number of people with PTO and no idea what to do with it, is not as large as the number of people with PTO who know exactly what to do with it because they have families, which is not as large as the number of people who work hourly with no PTO at all.<p>In addition, we&#x27;ve all had the experience of an ignorant manager, executive, or client thinking they know better because they considered themselves a power user, or because they &quot;used to&quot; do the task we were designing or building a solution for, or because &quot;it&#x27;s just common sense.&quot;  Maybe you were able to prove them wrong by walking them through it, or showing them usability tests, or maybe you ended up having to build the feature and watch it fail in the market before something changed.<p>You are never entirely like your user, and you are most different from them by the fact that you can build a solution (getting it for free after your labor is complete), whereas you are asking them to pay you for it (meaning they have to choose to not buy other things).<p>That&#x27;s why Blank/Ries want you to validate by &quot;getting out of the building&quot; and focus on actually getting paid.",1401429227

All modern and future craft will be mostly- or fully-autonomous. Soyuz still requires some technical skill, though not actual flying, but unless you&#x27;re Russian you aren&#x27;t going to be a Soyuz commander anyway.<p>But it seems the best bet to become a government astronaut is still to be a test pilot. The Navy actually seems to be a more popular source than the Air Force. Army or Marine aviation may also be good, as there are fewer of them and NASA seems to like to distribute picks among the services.<p>You can also go get a PhD (or, even better, two) in something hard-research-y. Something with bio- in the title is probably good. They do still pick a few civilians.<p>Even better is to have two PhDs and be a test pilot. That&#x27;ll get their attention. If you have to pick one, military might still be best: NASA should probably be picking the best possible lab assistants, but old habits die hard and the astronaut office is rather invested in the test pilot idea. But they might shift a bit once they&#x27;re all flying passenger on commercial transport.<p>On the other hand, if they ever get Orion flying, they&#x27;ll probably want to staff it with test pilots. I don&#x27;t think anyone else would be crazy enough to get on the thing within the next two decades considering their &quot;test program&quot;.",1401428692

That thing looks like something right out of a movie. Does anyone have a direct link to the flight testing program?<p>I agree with others that the vibration environment may be challenging. Most of the ships and ship mockups I&#x27;ve seen had a lot of work to avoid randomly hitting switches, it would not do to have an atmospheric bump cause you to make some mistake in commanding it. Presumably the entire thing can be flown on automatic so the first flight can be with just flight test dummies rather than people.<p>My other initial impression is that it makes NASA&#x27;s efforts with the Orion project look somewhat kludgy in comparison. Sort of the &#x27;go kart&#x27; versus an actual car. I&#x27;m sure a lot of that is just the resonance that Orion has with the Apollo capsule from the 60&#x27;s and the modern look of Dragon 2 but the difference between propulsive landing vs parachutes is huge. Cost of operations goes waaay down if you land people on the ground.<p>I really feel like somebody from the future popped into the present and &#x27;snuck&#x27; in design that wouldn&#x27;t normally be seen for 50 years or so.

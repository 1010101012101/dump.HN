Especially in the startup space, a lot of people like to write their experiences into lessons when they have no basis for doing so.  I imagine they want more people to read their article/blog post and it is some manner of self promotion.  That is fine, but as a reader, you can just ignore whatever their have to say, it probably isn&#x27;t useful.<p>Paul Graham is an obvious exception.  He writes semi infrequently (1-2 essays a month as of recently), goes to great lengths to have them edited by people with diverse viewpoints and based on his position and experience has a great perspective to give useful lessons.  There are other good writers, but not many, and pg is probably the best due to his unique perspective.

What I found was that the average base salaries were between 45k to 70k for these SEIU and ATU workers.<p>A lot of the information on salaries that&#x27;s published out there include overtime, pension, medical benefits, PTO, etc., but that&#x27;s the total cost for BART, and not necessarily the annual income that an employee pockets.  For me, I wanted to see if a BART employee could make a comfortable living in the bay area, and for that, things like overtime and pension aren&#x27;t as relevant since you either have to work more to earn them, or you don&#x27;t really see them until the future.

They have been doing advertisement all over the place that they sell it for 404 zl without a contract, even in those shops, but they wouldn&#x27;t sell them to me, or they would but only with a two years contract which ended up costing around 1200 zl. So I gave up.<p>At home again I checked their website[2] again, and yep, there they still (and to this day) advertise it for 404 zl.<p>I later found out that if you have a polish ID you can order one for 404 zl from their website which I did with help of my fathers ID.<p>So they were just fucking with me, again, and yeah, this was not the first time.

In biology and medicine, it takes a while for a piece of published research to become accepted, as such recent findings are usually only of interest to other researchers.

The idea is that a system would anonymously give out insider trading information to one or more people with the highest amount of karma.  The granter of the stock tip would get a corresponding boost (or drop) in karma based on the value of the knowledge but couldn&#x27;t benefit from the insider information directly with the exception in the future they would have a greater likely hood of getting anonymous insider information based on their karma point count.<p>example:\n1) Alice creates an anomymous tip that Apple stock is likely to drop due to an unexpected sales decrease of the iphone 6.\n2) The system establishes an initial weight for the stock tip based on company valuation and reliability of Alice.\n3) The system identifies a user or set of users with the highest current karma points.  Bob is one of these users.  Bob&#x27;s karma point total is reduced by the value of the recommendation.\n4) Later on after banking a large number of points Alice is given a tip that Tesla stock is expected to rise.  Alice is able to profit on this insider knowledge without... really having insider knowledge<p>This is somewhat akin to profiting off of documents in the back seat of a taxi.

6543548,comment,6543018,6543018,1,0,throwawaykf02,,,"Let me argue why I think this is patent is not too bad, and actually interesting in some ways not typically discussed.<p>First here&#x27;s the broadest claim (formatted for readability):<p><i>A non-transitory computer-readable medium that stores instructions executable by one or more processors to perform a method for attracting users to a web page, comprising:<p>instructions for creating a special event logo by modifying a standard company logo for a special event, where the instructions for creating the special event logo includes instructions for modifying the standard company logo with one or more animated images;<p>instructions for associating a link or search results with the special event logo, the link identifying a document relating to the special event, the search results relating to the special event;<p>instructions for uploading the special event logo to the web page;<p>instructions for receiving a user selection of the special event logo; and instructions for providing the document relating to the special event or the search results relating to the special event based on the user selection.</i><p>It&#x27;s certainly not revolutionary, but patents rarely are. It was filed in 2001 and finally issued in 2011, being rejected multiple times along the way. That may have been partly due to them trying to claim too much and partly the &quot;reject by default&quot; unofficial policy then-director Dudas had instituted within the USPTO during his reign. (Patent practitioners encouraged to chime in here.) Nevertheless, what has emerged is not really too bad (for a certain perspective of &quot;bad&quot;) because it&#x27;s a) pretty narrow, and thus, b) highly unlikely to infringe by mistake. As such, this is not a good example of the patent system being broken, even though at first glance it does not seem very novel.<p>But I could also make an argument for novelty! Google Doodles probably <i>is</i> pretty novel because Google was -- as far as I can tell -- the first company to <i>systematically</i> modify its logo this way. Sure, several brands modify their logos once in a while, e.g. during Christmas, but Google took it to a whole new level, and in doing so, cultivated a fun and carefree personality for their brand. There&#x27;s an interview with an early Google employee where he says he was horrified by this practice because it went against everything he was taught in Brand Management 101. I know nothing about brand management, but if true, it makes a case for non-obviousness. Furthermore, this undoubtedly system fulfills the title of the patent, because many people, including myself, often visit the Google homepage just to check out the doodles. It&#x27;s undeniably a beneficial feature for their business.<p>Unfortunately, &quot;systematically modifying a company logo to create a fun-loving brand perception&quot; is not what they patented. For various reasons, such as being a business method and a rather abstract concept, such a claim would be difficult to get through. (Yes, even in the USPTO.) Maybe they tried anyway, which may be why it took 10 years to issue. But what they actually got was the claim above, which is simply a collection of steps to change the company logo during special events and link it to search results that really only applies to web search engines. It says nothing of the execution and artistic chops required to pull it off properly. It says nothing about brand management and the unique brand perception it created. There are only certain things a patent can protect.<p>And I&#x27;m honestly not sure why Google worked so hard to protect this with a patent. There are easier ways to inflate a portfolio, and even if we assume it to be a &quot;good&quot; patent, it&#x27;s worthless. Because after 10 years and tens of thousands of dollars put in, Google now has a patent that nobody else will infringe simply because it&#x27;s something that probably only Google can pull off with their brand.",1381688393

If apples don&#x27;t fall from trees and matter is not attracted to other matter then the gravity hypothesis has no evidence for it to even be considered! We see apples fall and planets orbit and matter attracting other matter and so we think, there must be something there! So we investigate and only after much testing do we say that the hypothesis is scientific fact within the bounds it was tested.<p>>> Until you get clear evidence, it is a matter of philosophy, and you can fill it with anything that doesn&#x27;t contradict the known facts.<p>NO YOU CAN&#x27;T. Why? Because the nonsense (&quot;philosophy&quot;) you fill it with STILL REQUIRES EVIDENCE when you claim that something positively certainly EXISTS such as a creator of the universe. You can claim you HYPOTHESIZE that there exists a creator, but it is on YOU to prove that a creator exists, not on anyone else to disprove it, especially when the scientific body of knowledge, both theoretical and experimental, shows no evidence and no sign of a creator outside of humans projecting their own desires.",1381687282

DRM is already a required and de facto standard for the Open Web -- it&#x27;s just hiding inside of NPAPI and ActiveX. It&#x27;s there and it&#x27;s even worse than DRM because there are no DRM plug-ins that don&#x27;t bring massive runtimes with them that are the number one cause of security problems on the Web.<p>(If you do not have Flash or Silverlight today, you are not going to be able to watch restricted content. Pretty much everyone has one or both installed and will happily install it if it&#x27;s not already on their system.)<p>Killing NPAPI and ActiveX, which is how DRM integrates with browsers today, and replacing it with a much smaller and considerably safer API is progress at <i>shrinking</i> the proprietary surface of today&#x27;s real Web.<p>This is two steps forward and one step back, folks.

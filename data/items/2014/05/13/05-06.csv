While the lenovo laptop has only 4 gb ram, Im planning to add another 4GB so that is fine.  My concern is, I&#x27;ll be using the laptop for programming.  It will mostly involve text processing and occasional number crunching. I will also be using two vms. Both the machines are quad core.  Will the 4 mb L2 cache of HP have a greater impact on performance compared the 1 mb L2 cache of  Lenovo?<p>This is going to be my primary work machine.  I have only worked with thinkpads till date.  So I&#x27;m also concerned about the comfort level of the keyboards.  Has anyone used the HP Pavilion keyboards?   Also, I have only used keyboards sans dedicated numeric keys.

7736708,comment,7730042,7731570,2,0,eigenvector,,,"It&#x27;s a cost vs. energy carried trade-off.<p>Both systems have resistive loses proportional to the square of the current. However:<p>1. Total power transferred in a DC system is proportional to the voltage, whereas power transferred in an AC system is proportional to the RMS voltage (which is roughly 0.7 of nominal for a sine wave), so more energy is transmitted at the same current level in HVDC.<p>2. AC systems manifest impedance which has a resistive (aka DC) component as above as well as a reactive (aka AC) component, i.e. Z = R + jX. In DC systems X = 0. In a theoretical transmission line no energy is absorbed or supplied from line reactance, but in practice we have to transmit a certain amount of reactive power (VARs) to charge the line capacitance/inductance each AC cycle. This reduces the amount of our current capacity (limited by thermal constraints) that actually carries current that can be delivered to the load as active power (watts).<p>This effect is somewhat although not directly proportional to distance (characteristic impedance has no dependence on line length, but voltage drops along the line due to resistive effects meaning the variation from the optimal reactive power-minimizing voltage level increases).<p>The effect of (1) and (2) is that for any given conductor, at a given voltage level, more usable energy can be transmitted with DC than AC, and that differential increases with distance.<p>That being said, building DC converter and switching stations is much more expensive than AC. So for a shorter line, or one that has many switching stations, I could counter the above by simply generating 5-8% more power at the generating station and still come out ahead (because in real engineering everything is about $).<p>Therefore, DC is only more cost-effective ($/MVA of energy delivered) at long distances.",1399959956

I have hobbies that come and go and I try to keep myself healthy.<p>The only reason I get out of bed in the morning is because I don&#x27;t want to lose my job.

My problem is that is that I just don&#x27;t really know what my goals are in life any more. I don&#x27;t know what makes me happy and I don&#x27;t know what motivates me. Some people have a family to provide for, others a burning ambition to make the world a better place. Some people have the desire to become rich beyond their wildest dreams.

The string your errors are producing are for developers to use and not end users, and to localise them you&#x27;ll want to return error codes will enable the front end to select and choose the right message to display to a user depending on their locale.<p>If you&#x27;re a HTTP API, immediately you&#x27;ll think, &quot;Ah, HTTP codes suffice, I&#x27;ll return &#x27;HTTP 404 no coffee&#x27; or &#x27;HTTP 428 not enough coffee&#x27;&quot; but you&#x27;ll notice straight away that neither code fitted the scenario of &quot;not enough coffee&quot; well. Additionally, if you tell a client that HTTP 404 means &quot;not enough coffee&quot; you&#x27;re stuck when you want to explain that they can&#x27;t have jam on toast without actually having toast.<p>Yes HTTP codes help to tell HTTP clients what type of error happened, but fails to tell a client which message should be shown to help the end user resolve the problem... besides, our error string isn&#x27;t localised (and shouldn&#x27;t be, perhaps someone implemented a Welsh client and we do not know Welsh) so would the end user understand the message?

They may be adequate for telling a developer something happened, and with logging they can tell a developer where it happened... but they are woeful at communicating with a user to help correct an error.<p>Error libs need both a message, and an error code (which isn&#x27;t a HTTP code).<p>Stack traces are nice, but I find logging is better (and log.go can tell you which file and line the message was logged from) and HTTP codes are not adequate error codes, an application should have it&#x27;s own table of codes.<p>PS: Interesting to note that Go does have error codes and a set of constants for a large number of errors <a href=""http://golang.org/pkg/syscall/#pkg-constants"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/pkg/syscall/#pkg-constants</a> but it hasn&#x27;t made them first class by having godoc document errors a package has, encouraging everyone to create and use error codes, etc.",1399959163

Plust, you haven&#x27;t really needed commercial libraries for the past few years.  Search nuget.org, it&#x27;ll have just about anything you need.<p>2)  You have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about.  ADO.NET is arguably the MOST robust database driver abstraction out there, with support for just about any DB.<p>3) Simply not true.  Conservatism strikes everywhere, especially outside of startups.  However, it&#x27;s up to the developers to decide if a technology is viable for their ecosystem, not you.  Just because it&#x27;s new doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better.<p>4) First-class experience?  Tell me how robust your Javascript refactoring workflow is? Python?  Oh, that&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s damn near impossible to refactor either one without investing serious time wading through code.<p>5) IT stuff is hard, whether you&#x27;re running Nginx/Apache on Linux, or IIS on Windows.  It&#x27;s not, however, more difficult for IIS.  Technet was outdated anyway.  Look at <a href=""http://www.iis.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iis.net/</a>.  It&#x27;s way more useful than Technet ever was.  Oh, and you don&#x27;t like IIS?  It&#x27;s what OWIN was made for.

While jquery does a good job of shimming in hacks for older browsers the world of graphics programming isn&#x27;t really that flexible and even newer drivers can still be a total grab bag of what they support - think of it like this: you have the latest version of Firefox and you can support everything but rendering text in italics. How would you shim that in? Can you? What if it tells you it supports it but it actually slants text the other way? What if it renders correctly but doing it the normal way takes an hour but there&#x27;s a hack for only this operating system and version of Gecko that works.

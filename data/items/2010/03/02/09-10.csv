Apple seems pretty intent on keeping their policy of forbidding interpreters, plug-ins, virtual machines and the like. To really be as sophisticated as Excel, a program must include a scripting language and extension mechanism. That's not to say that a spreadsheet without those features isn't just as useful to most users, but it certainly isn't as sophisticated.<p>Apple may, of course ignore the rules it requires third-party developers to live under when building its own software.",1267522047

Up until now technology has created as many jobs as it’s eliminated but as technology becomes both more powerful and more stable that ratio is going to shift.  Jobs like factory workers, teachers, bankers, etc… are going to disappear and society will have to adjust to having more people than jobs (and figure out what to do about that).<p>Again, I think the eventual end result is good.  As technology can do more we’ll eventually end up with a society where people can pursue what they love and let technology do most of the hard work we need people for now.  But getting from where we are now to that future is going to be awkward as society has to decide how to deal with things like permanent unemployment.<p>Beyond that Millennials are going to be the generation that has to deal with all the awkward ethical questions that science fiction has been asking for years.  Cloning, Genetic Manipulation, Climate Change, Bio Weapons, etc… are all going to drop on the Millennials plate.  That’s a lot to deal with.<p>Anyway, as I said I’m optimistic but with an eye towards the enormous challenges that are ahead.",1267521379

I&#x27;m curious though for people that do: why do you use tools like this for credit cards and other non-password information? Seems to me that all that information already lives in places where they are used: paper documents waiting for paper forms or in-person verification, credit cards saved in the sites they are used for...<p>or maybe I just answered my own question, why leave credit cards on sites anymore and risk it when you can always carry the info securely with you?...hmm.",1441994373

People then start having blind faith in their tests while being completely oblivious to what they don&#x27;t test. At that point the codebase is such a mess that you do need tests to maintain it.<p>People who focus on understanding their code work very, very hard to keep their codebase simple enough to quickly wrap their heads around it. I know I modify my codebase way too much for it to have tests - I&#x27;d spend more time refactoring the tests than progressing and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to simplify the architecture as much because my attention is now on how testable the code is rather than how simple it is.<p>I see projects shipped with unittests that still required maintenance and debugging 6 months down the road, and others without tests that worked flawlessly out the door.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s a difference between understanding and thinking you understand, but that&#x27;s another matter entirely as we&#x27;re walking into Dunning-Kruger territory!<p>I&#x27;m not saying tests are bad! Far from it, I do write tests for functions where the logic isn&#x27;t obvious, but my point is that there&#x27;s too much focus on testing and not enough on actual quality and simplicity.",1441994355

Unfortunately, the people in control of the pursestrings don&#x27;t have the same day-to-day perspective of the people actually using the system.

Good state schools are a much better use of funds as they drive down for profit education costs to be cost competitive.

When you read a news article, you interpret it with context. You ask, what is the reputation of the agency reporting this news? Do they have a history of factual reporting? Do they bring a particular political bent or agenda to bear on their reporting? What words are they using to tell the story? What does it mean when someone refers to the &quot;War on Terror&quot; - how do you understand that metaphor? What memories, emotions, experiences does it evoke? How is that phrase intended to be interpreted?<p>There is so much more to write about this, but bottom line for me is: language drives human interaction. Understanding how others interpret language (through metaphor, shared understanding, history, etc.) is important for navigating that interaction. It helps us call bullshit on politicians who use words to conceal ignorance, or maybe on teachers who don&#x27;t actually understand the literature they are presenting ;)<p>I imagine you were never rewarded for &quot;filling up pages&quot; with actual bull shit, so you picked up metaphors at some point along the way.",1441994262

10205155,comment,10204095,10204372,0,0,hackuser,,,"> in the 80s, 90s and 00s everything about our society became more and more regulated and safety conscious (hotels, taxis, health care, education) meaning costs skyrocketed, and the cost of entry to compete in those markets became astronomical.<p>Speaking generally, I think it&#x27;s safe to say that this is the opposite of what happened. The hallmarks of Reagan&#x27;s [1] and Thatcher&#x27;s economic policies in the 1980s was massive deregulation (and privatisation). By the end of the decade it became the global norm for economic policy, a consensus generally accepted by even their left-wing successors, Clinton and Blair, by many others around the world, and became a key part of the &quot;Washington Consensus&quot;,[2] which was a set of economic policies forced on poor countries who needed aid by Western governments and agencies (and accused often of coldly sacrificing the welfare of hundreds of millions of very poor people). As a more recent example, excessive deregulation of the financial industry, such as the repeal of Glass-Steagall act [3], is widely blamed as a signicant cause of the financial crisis of 2008.<p>I&#x27;ll add an interesting point: The period of perhaps greatest economic growth in the West, the 1950s and 60s, was the period of greatest government regulation and direct involvement in economies. Deregulation began in the 1980s and while economies have grown since then, wages for most Americans have been flat for 30 years. That proves nothing, but it suggests the evidence for the libertarian theory isn&#x27;t so clear cut. (Personally I think regulation is not an ideology but a tool, good for some things and not for others.)<p>[1] It actually began under Jimmy Carter, a little known fact.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cid.harvard.edu/cidtrade/issues/washington.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cid.harvard.edu/cidtrade/issues/washington.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/wallstreet/weill/demise.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/wallstreet/wei...</a>",1441994182

The best answer I can give you is &quot;good question.&quot; The best answer Banks could give you is spread out over an award-winning series of nine books, so it&#x27;s probably worth a look.<p>For starters, Minds are fully aware of how big a deal mind reading is, and virtually never actually do it. A situation has to be ethically ridiculous before a Mind will even begin to consider it, we&#x27;re talking &quot;this person was brainwashed into hiding a nuke on the puppy daycare planet and we can&#x27;t find it&quot; sort of situations. This somewhat changes the question: &quot;If the Mind <i>could</i> read your thoughts and predict your future actions, but <i>hasn&#x27;t,</i> what does it mean to... &quot; Again, the best answer I can give you is &quot;good question.&quot; I suppose it&#x27;s worth pointing out that if the mere possibility is enough to deprive you of free will, your universe is totally deterministic, the Mind doesn&#x27;t have free will either, and you&#x27;re all in the same boat. The Mind doesn&#x27;t meaningfully have any &quot;control&quot; over you, since nobody has control over anything. The realization that you don&#x27;t posses free will won&#x27;t help you gain free will since that realization was itself inevitable and the actions you take as a result are too.<p>Further, if you know the Mind can perfectly predict your future actions when they scan your brain, does that change how you&#x27;ll act? What if they scan your brain in secret and don&#x27;t tell you so you don&#x27;t know when their prediction was formed? I&#x27;m going to take an example from a source I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;re all familiar with: the 2007 film <i>Next</i>, starring Nicolas Cage. The premise is that Mr. Cage&#x27;s character can observe his own future for the next two minutes. The big caveat is that it only gives him a highly useful idea of what the future is probably like and not a faultless prediction. By the time he&#x27;s done looking, the future has changed because he looked at it. The end result is that he never actually knows the future. His power is subject to the &quot;observer effect:&quot; the act of detecting the future caused it to change, so he only knows what the future <i>would have been</i> at the moment he used his ability. From then on, the actual future is different, and the only way to know how it changed is to use his ability again, which will yet again change the future. A simpler but less Cage-tastic example is detecting electrons. You can observe when photons interact with the electron, but the electron&#x27;s path was altered by the photon, so good luck figuring out where it is now. You could wait for it to interact with another photon, but that will cause... and so on. Perhaps the Mind shooting a bunch of futuristic radio waves or whatever inside your skull alters your thinky bits, and the very act of detecting your mental state alters your mental state. The Mind will then extrapolate from data that was outdated by the very act of producing it, and his prediction will be wrong. How wrong? Wrong enough to matter philosophically? &quot;Good question.&quot;",1441993070

People think that the drugs are magic and will close the gaps in their training.  It really is all about training- as the article says, the drugs are used because the human body isn&#x27;t able to recover quickly enough from the volume of training required of professional athletes; in most sports it has nothing to do with adding more muscle.  In fact most athletes don&#x27;t want to add muscle willy-nilly because it makes it harder to move.  If professional athletes were able to honestly discuss the drugs that they use and their dosages I think it would make things safer for young athletes, because most people don&#x27;t understand how low the dosages that they take are and it would PROVE that you can&#x27;t replace hard training with drugs.  There are young athletes now taking dosages that far exceed what even world class athletes would consider because there&#x27;s no honest discussion around them, they can&#x27;t make informed decisions.<p>Tl;dr: Hiding information never makes people safer.

And in the decade since then, I have experienced the pains of rigorous training and competition without PEDs, while also interacting with lots of grapplers who discussed how PEDs helped them.<p>None of them believed that the competitive advantage from steroids comes from the additional muscular strength they provide during a fight or a jiu-jitsu match. Instead, the steroids allowed them to train with a frequency and intensity that is virtually impossible for natural competitors.<p>This recuperative advantage is still &quot;cheating,&quot; but it feels morally different in the sense that the athlete is <i>enhancing</i> his technique by training more, not using steroid-enabled strength to <i>compensate</i> for poor technique. (The same is not true of something like blood doping.)<p>I&#x27;m not arguing that PEDs should necessarily be permitted in athletic competition.

Even for clear-cutting, you have to leave a regulated number of stems, of certain diameters, on the piece of land.<p>Typically, the way you would cut a piece of land is by selectively cutting out the species and grades of lumber that are actually worth money.  So one winter you go in and cut the big, high-quality pine, or spruce and fir for saw logs.  Another season you might cut out the high-quality veneer-grade hardwood trees.  Of course, when you do this, you would also cut a bunch of the junk that is never going to grow into profitable timber, and sell that as pulpwood for making paper, or low-quality logs for making pallets, or sell it as firewood.  If you selectively cut like this, it&#x27;s not particularly difficult to rotate through a series of stands and continue to harvest them indefinitely, and you maintain a variable-age forest that sustains the local wildlife, to boot.<p>At least on the East coast, it&#x27;s not really necessary to replant cut sections, even if you do go in and clear cut them, since there is so much residual seed on the ground already, and many of the species will even sprout again from stump.  You go through a short cycle of black/raspberries and other scrub growth to fix the soil, then the young softwood/hardwood whips come up through, and within ten years you&#x27;ve got a stand of wood that&#x27;s ready to be thinned out again, to clean out the junk and let the good wood grow up into profitable timber again.<p>On the West coast, as I understand it, replanting is more important, since many of the species won&#x27;t grow from seed UNLESS there has been a forest fire.<p>The United States is also more forested now than it has been in a hundred years, since so much land formerly cleared for agriculture has grown back as forest.  If you could look at Google Earth imagery of New England from 1900 and today, the difference would be astounding.",1441991739

There are a lot of non-obvious factors that make performing those kind of measurements from orbit a bit of a nightmare.<p>As far as I understand space comms--which isn&#x27;t that far--the &#x27;pilot beam&#x27; technique used by satellite links is more or less a way to get a phase lock on the signal beam, which will accurately determine the exact target location, at which point the space transmitter can use a beam-forming antenna to to jack up the power to that locale specifically, giving better SNR/bandwidth/whatever. The key bit here is that (a) the method requires that the <i>target</i>--i.e. your bedroom window--transmits the pilot beam up, and (b) only &#x27;solves&#x27; the atmospheric interference issue by pointing a powerful beam accurately.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it could probably be done with enough money, and if anybody could do it would would be the US intelligence machine. Same goes for a drone, to a lesser extent. With anything flying in the atmosphere you&#x27;ll have to do deal with local vibrations on the same order as the measurement deltas you care about, but there are ways to do that too.

Like the original article says, poems are meant to be interpreted, and I think Frost played with the words to encourage different interpretations, even the literal reading of the last few lines out of context.<p>The poem is essentially a commentary on interpretation. There&#x27;s the initial evaluation of the paths, evaluation along the path, and an evaulation of future evaluations, showing how those interpretations change over time. The initial evaluation is that the less worn one might be more interesting. During the walk, there&#x27;s the interpretation that they&#x27;re probably both the same, and an evaluation of future evaluation, emphasizing the importance of the choice and implying self-deception.<p>I think this follows the actual propagation of consequences according to chaos theory. At the moment when a choice is made, the effects are relatively small, but we all know that long-term effects of those minor differences cause large divergences in the future. So there&#x27;s an actual element of truth to the final evaluation, even though it&#x27;s considered as self-deception, because of the passage of time and repeated self-interpretation of the choice, even if the roads were about the same.<p>Essentially, the choice itself is consequential, even if the immediate results of the choice are not.",1441991626

You want to read it a certain way, and intend to keep reading it that way, because that&#x27;s the way you&#x27;ve always read it. The &quot;words are the words&quot; sentiment says nothing about the words, but rather how you read them.<p>The sort of traditionalism you&#x27;re expressing fascinates me, as the psychological phenomenon appears to me to underpin things like climate denial-ism, anti-vaxxing and religious fundamentalism.<p>At the very core, I suspect, is a tendency to be defensive about our limitations. To apply enough critical analysis to the poem to divine Frost&#x27;s true intent, to become informed enough about science to accept the basics of climate change, it takes a lot of time and effort, yet we treat people who can&#x27;t / refuse / just don&#x27;t have the time to do these things as if they&#x27;re stupid.<p>So they retreat into defensive positions, that the evidence is suspect, why believe Orr, I / we had a way to interpret the poem / organize society so why should we change?

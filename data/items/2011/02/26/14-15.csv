Didn't take more than a few hours to cut, join and mount it, and it is completely future proof.<p>To mirror everyone else's comments, cable everything you can.  I ran 2x RG-6 quad shield, 2x CAT-5e to each panel and home-ran it.  If I did it again I'd also run a CAT-3 (I won't use it but future buyers might want it).

We didn't.<p>Instead, it remains:  To build something solid, we need solid specifications of (1) what the thing is to do and (2) what we have to work with and then actually design the thing so that we are fairly sure from the design that we will get (1).<p>E.g., to build a bridge across the Golden Gate of SF, we still need solid specifications of (1) what the bridge is to do and (2) steel, concrete, the bedrock, etc.  Otherwise you won't want to drive across the bridge.<p>Well (1) is a 'specification', and so far we still need one.

Yes.  Easy?  No.  Doable for all such problems now?  No.<p>Without the math, with a lot of effort, some human 'domain expertise', some heuristics, a lot of fitting ('machine learning') to a lot of empirical data, a lot of testing and revision, we can build software that can do well, say, playing chess or answering questions on TV.<p>Still, you wouldn't want to drive across a bridge built that way.  If the bridge had stood for a year, then maybe you'd try it.  But you wouldn't want to be a test pilot for an airplane designed that way.<p>If constructing solid math specifications is too difficult and just ""I will know I like it when I see it"" is too sloppy, then we could use some new 'paradigms'.

919694,comment,919505,919612,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"I tried to lay this out as succinctly as I could in the post :)<p>The primary reason and goal of Duck Duck Go is to get you the information you're searching for faster, and with less mental effort.<p>This new view in particular does that by reducing the clicking back and forth between results. It pulls out <i>good</i> info from pages where it exists. Often you click to a page and then search for your terms within that page, only to find they don't exist or only exist in a cursory or unrelated fashion.<p>By displaying paragraphs of readable text, you should get a much better idea whether that page has what you want. And I hope that in some cases you won't actually have to click. The take a peek feature (hover over magnifying glass) furthers this hope.<p>Another way to look at part of it is we are saving you (at least partially) from the myriad of interfaces that exist on all the sites on the Internet. We pull out the good parts, via Duck It or Take a Peek, and standardize the formatting for you.",1257267340

For example, when I was shopping for a newly released netbook, I searched the keyword on twitter for a few days, to see what people say about it and what new reviews are being released. After a few days, I was able to detect the ""mood"", in other words, how people feel about the product. That is very hard to achieve with just reading a professional review.<p>More generally, if I want to know what <i>now</i> is happening about something, twitter can usually deliver that.",1257264617

I guarantee you the dollar will buy less 10-20 years from now. But we are doing things that will hurt the purchasing power of the dollar. On the other hand the same thing is happening in different countries around the world. The British will run a deficit of 12 and a fraction percent of GDP. Even the Germans will run a deficit of 6 and a fraction GDP. You've got governments around the world all electing to run very material deficits. Electiing to do that to offset the contraction demand. How that plays out in relative exchange rates - I can't tell you. In terms of currency's purchasing power in the future - it's going to cause units of currency to buy a lot less.That isn't gonna happen in the next year or two. Doesn't mean markets won't start anticipating it at some point. We are doing things that we havne't seen in the past. And policy makers do not know the outcome and I don't know the outcome. You do know it will have consequences and you can bet on inflation.</i><p>Munger: <i>I remember the 2 cent first-class stamp and the 5 cent hamburger.

I try everything I read to see if its faster. I find that its resizing elements during an animation that really affect speed. Stopping event bubbling is pretty nice too. But things I didn't know like using reverse loops because comparing to ""0"" is faster than an int. or setting [i] into variable after the ""++"" so the whole length isnt processed over and over. What about using ""Math."" instead of (var calc = a1 * a2 / a3), var calc = Math.round((a1*a2)/a3); because using the preMthods in the dom is faster. These things really work and I saw my performance shoot through the roof!!     My number one performance enhancer though? Dont use <img> tags.

I kind of see what you are driving at, but I view your site's potential and possibly its purpose differently. On the surface you are saying your site will answer that question of needing to buy the book, but does it really need answering? Enough to keep users drawn to your site? One might argue that in this day with all the connectivity and info online there is no course that couldn't be passed without buying the book, unless the professor was a stickler for the exact material in question, and even then networking with other students could assuage the need.<p>I think the question now becomes more philosophical. What do I want out of the course? Just a passing grade or something I can look back on and reference? When viewed that way your site can be about more than just answering that single, quite subjective, question. What I would do is try to foster discussion about the course. Let's say I want to take an art class. I go to shouldigetthebook.com and see nothing there, but I can leave an email to be notified of others inquiring and/or commenting on the same class. Chances are there would be some good discussion we could have. <i>That's</i> the kind of content you could foster on your site, and users would contribute because it's of interest to them. Eventually users could certainly answer the question of whether or not the course book is needed, but there is so much more that the question seems almost incidental.",1257264399

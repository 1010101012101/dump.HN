650799,comment,650720,650720,0,0,kwamenum86,,,"I hadn't heard the term decision engine before Microsoft started using the term in their Bing marketing.  Now, around a week later there is already a second ""decision engine"" according to the media.  Of course, this is just a headline written to bait the user because Hunch.com has not been called a decision engine before.  I sincerely hope that we do not have a new class of websites branded as decision engines because that term is vapid and nebulous.  No feature that Bing offers is a unique one so if it is a decision engine it was not the first.",1244631095

It's periodically down, and that stuff needs to work.  And GitHub FI looks pricey.<p>I think I'm better off with a VPS, gitosis, and local backups. It's cheap, it works, and it doesn't matter that I don't have all the cool social networking aspects of GitHub.",1244630509

I really hate the industry (at least the local one).<p>Life would be a lot easier for me if programming was a hobby in my spare time. But as it goes, I'm doing a lot of work on projects that I don't like, and when going home I don't have enough energy left to work on things I love.<p>I don't think I'll ever give up programming though.",1244630041

650787,comment,650761,650761,0,0,locopati,,,"It's a great theory as long as all those outsourced sites: stay in business, offer you a way to backup your information, don't act like jerks (ex: suddenly killing your account for unknown and unanswerable reasons), don't suddenly change business models and start charging you a lot for what was cheap or something for what was free.<p>Perhaps there's room in the market for all-in-one local solutions (even if it's the freely-produced-out-of-love market). I'm thinking of something like Wamp for Windows (a complete LAMP stack that you can install from one exe and gives you a simple control panel for the whole thing). Maybe a Linux distro that installs (or gives you options during install) all the packages you might want for a web business - source control, bug tracking, blog, wiki, web server, db, scripting languages, etc) plus configures firewall, backup systems, etc (or guides you through setting up something like that). Or maybe it's not a distro but a HOWTO.<p>Or maybe that sort of thing already exists and someone wants to link to it :)",1244629598

You can pick the member state with the taxation and registration regime that fits the best your company's needs; if you need low taxes, you can go to Luxembourg, if you prefer common law, you can set it up in Cyprus or the UK or Ireland, etc. Usually you don't need to be a resident of an EU member country to set up a company there, but then again, this varies by country.",1244628199

Personally, I game to relax and I watch movies to be mentally (and emotionally) challenged.<p>The problem with games is that they, by their very nature, have problems for the storyteller:<p>First, they take away his control from (at least) one of the characters, since it has to be given to the player. This means that either certain stories can't be told as they should, since you can't force the player to have the same motivations as the character, especially if they're supposed to be revealed only later.<p>Second, plenty of great movies would make shitty games. Dialog driven movies (<i>12 Angry Men</i>), for example. You'd need to put the player on rails and limit his movements to a minimum - and to do that, why make a game at all?<p>Third, game play can distract from the story.

3492498,comment,3492347,3492347,2,0,apaprocki,,,"The term, at least to me, does not necessarily refer to storage of large amounts of data. At Bloomberg, we process a large amount of data in realtime. When focusing on the processing of realtime market data, the hardware topology looks different than when you are, say, doing a map reduce across a huge number of nodes. You often have a single point of entry for a particular stream (with redundancy, of course), but then the trick is to efficiently distribute the data to the many places that require it with as near zero latency as possible. Obviously there is a need for longer term storage and instantaneous retrieval of billions of data points, but the largest focus is on near-zero latency from point of consumption, distributing to all internal nodes/apps and to many thousands of sites in 180+ countries with a large number of ""nines"".<p>The biggest challenge is that data feeds originate in nearly all of those countries and also need to be distributed efficiently to every other country. (e.g., NASDAQ originates in the US and reaches around the globe, and the same is true for realtime feeds on the opposite side of the globe in the Middle East, India, Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, etc.) The Internet is not reliable from a latency point of view so coupled with the required hardware is the required network. We operate one of the largest private networks in the world.<p>edit: Also, from a processing point of view we have had great success with speeding up complex algorithms that would normally take minutes to run across huge compute clusters, bringing them down to seconds by porting them to run on large GPU clusters. Certain things are definitely suited for running on GPUs, but I feel it is still pretty foreign to most programmers and hard for companies to decide to jump into that kind of project. You're starting to see more specialized use of GPU or slower-clock-but-massively-parallel compute devices for a wider variety of tasks.

I admit, that's my impression, and not based on any study or such.<p>It feels almost as if people would wish that artists/actors, etc. would return to a time of travelling acts like vaudeville

They spend over $100 million dollars developing the world's most advanced character design system and forgot to build an actual game around it. The original developer had to shut the game down after the first month or so, but then someone else bought it for a fraction of the development costs and reworked it into a Free To Play game. By all accounts, the gameplay is still absolutely terrible. Should only be a matter of time before they shut it down again.<p>There are a few reasons why I think this MMO would make an awesome engine for this startup.<p>1. The character customization system includes the ability to design clothing and tattoos for the character. If you don't like the wardrobe included in the game, you can design your own.<p>2. There is an equally extensive toolset to modify your character's physical appearance.<p>3. The customization was a main selling point for this game. People were supposed to be able to sell the clothing they designed in game and even exchange the virtual currency for more play time. This emphasis on user creativity means that the average APB player is probably more likely to begin playing with the intent to create their own content.<p>4. The studio that now owns the game didn't have to eat a $100 million loss, so they don't have to get a huge amount of money if they sell the game again. This combined with the fact that it failed once, and might again would ensure that there wouldn't be any competitors.<p>P.S. Another possible solution would be to just license the engine to create your own game. This is a common practice in the game industry and is usually far cheaper than trying to purchase a complete game.",1327116616

The primary change has been the delivery mechanism, which provided for alternative ways to consume the content, altered how it was made (think putting on a play vs making a film), and also shifted the power structure. Seven years ago it cost over $60 million to make a Hollywood blockbuster, and nearly another $40 million was spent on marketing (<a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3564377.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3564377.stm</a>).

At least in terms of consuming video content in the home, I imagine most of it occurs in front of the tv. I know there are various ways to watch movies, shows, and sometimes even sports without needing a cable or satellite subscription, but the options are still limited and way too spread out. The content that I want isn't available where I want it to be, when I want it to be, in a manner easily usable by most people.<p>I'm sure this is only one piece of the puzzle.

The crackdown on lobbyists starts",http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-16651524,"""The government says it hopes the industry ""will embrace steps to make it more transparent, making the process largely self-regulating"" but penalties could be enforced for ""non-compliance"".<p>These could include fines of up to 5,000 for missing deadlines, or a jail term for knowingly making misleading statements.""",1327115083

There is no language in the bill that prohibits sharing of non copyright infringing videos on the internet.<p>However, the language of the bill would make a website like YouTube a practical impossibility. They wouldn't be able to keep their doors open because there would be too much overhead in complying with the new laws, and they would be under constant threat of being shut down tomorrow, because someone claimed infringement.<p>I sympathize that someone who really doesn't understand how websites work and how something like YouTube functions would not understand this distinction.<p>However, if you don't understand the technical details about this, you should have a hearing and defer to experts rather than asking a bunch of MPAA and RIAA lobbyists to write a bill for you. It is like asking a militant vegan to design your slaughterhouse.",1327115001

However, <i>you're</i> comment is clearly a thinly veiled attempt to discredit my comment without actually contributing anything back.  That you'll <i>bite</i> is you attempting to play the part of the ""bigger person.""<p>The reality is, you start off by being ill-mannered, insulting, and petty.<p>Don't bring that stuff to HN.  <i>You</i> should know better.<p>> If I take the hard drive that an artist is storing the only copy of his/her mp3 on, then I have 'stolen' the mp3 because I have deprived the artist of possession.<p>Actually, no.  In this case, the original had to come from somewhere.  Data was copied from one location to another.  What is up on MU is, in essence, a copy.  If the original owner then removes that original copy, it doesn't bless the copy with special privileges.  Hell, if you want to get technical, the artist never had possession of the only mp3 up on MU's server.  MU had possession.  The artist had access, but not possession.  He has, effectively, given MU the right to possess the copy.<p>Regardless, this example, as much as yours, is silly, because it's data.  We aren't talking about a physical thing.  You're trying to argue that data, somehow, can be stolen (1s and 0s, something we've long argued can't be ""stolen"").<p>Honestly, I can't take any of these arguments seriously, if only because they are using the same arguments the MPAA/RIAA have been attempting to use against us for years.",1327114996

Around this hallowed box, millions of families converge nightly to get their daily dose of news and entertainment.  Millions of people are employed by the radio industry, and millions more depend upon it.  Whatever changes the winds of time may blow our way, you can be assured of this:  The radio will remain the primary medium through which the public gets its information and entertainment.""<p>Scarcely 20 years later, it would have been exceedingly difficult to find someone to defend this argument.  Just as the carriage makers gave way to the automobile, just as film gave way to digital, just as news gave way to the web: so too, will Hollywood give way to that which surpasses it.",1327114842

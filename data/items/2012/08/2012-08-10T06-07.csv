4365217,comment,4363210,4364386,2,0,FaceKicker,,,"> ""And in addition to your salary, we're also giving you a roll of quarters every month in case you need to pay tolls, do laundry at one of those barbaric laundromats not in the Googleplex, or play arcade games.""<p>... is it just me or would this be an incredible perk?  If a roll of quarters and an envelope with $250 worth of $1, $5, and $20 bills were delivered to my desk every month I'd save a lot of time going to the ATM or the laundromat for tips/laundry/cash-only restaurants/etc.  I think I'd willingly give up a lot more of my salary than it's actually worth for the convenience of perks like that.  Free laundry (like, full wash and fold and dry cleaning)? Shit, for that I'd probably take a $95K job over a $100K job (all other things being equal) even though it's really worth ~$1000 at most (comparing against the cost of laundry services, not machines, of course).  Does Facebook still have that?",1344581938

My English skills have always been top of the line (99% on standardized tests, 5s on APs, etc), and I fully accredit this to the fact that I have been reading CONSTANTLY since I was little. You have to develop an ability to hear the written word inside your head as your eyes move across the page--a lot of lower functioning people don't seem to have this, as indicated by the bizarre sentence constructions they vomit all over their word processor.<p>A knack for sentence flow isn't practiced, it is absorbed. Want to be a good writer? You need a vocabulary to match. Those of us who acquired extensive vocabularies through osmosis can tell when a lesser person has whipped out the thesaurus in an attempt to sound ""smart."" (usually, the fancy words they try to insert just end up hilariously misused, since they don't understand the different shades of meaning attached to them. You can only get that through observation of the word in its natural setting.)<p>As anecdata, I know someone with an English degree from our flagship state school who can't manage to comprehend the difference between ""its"" and ""it's,"" ""your"" and ""you're,"" and routinely mangles grammar in a manner absolutely horrifying even before you take into account the fact they studied English for OVER FOUR YEARS and still never managed to grasp the proper use of the possessive.",1344581902

In most (if not all) of Europe, universities are paid from tax payers money and are basically free for all who have the necessary qualification to attend them.<p>That shows though. I have the impression that you can make rather decent money in the US without ever going to college but there's not a glimpse of hope for you to do that in Europe.

Speaking as a current university student, the vast majority (>90%) of <i>required</i> coursework is trivial and can be easily summed up within a page or two of text per class. The ability to figure out what couple paragraphs are going to be tested on and to regurgitate them on demand is really all you need to get a passing grade for a significant percentage of your college career. Figuring that out over a period of a few days doesn't exactly require a superhuman effort, and is (in my experience) quite common. Cramming isn't a new phenomenon, and computers make it significantly easier to find a bunch of information and memorize it for a few days (before forgetting everything.)<p>Of course, that is not to say that there are not courses that require greater diligence - but they're often avoidable, and a student can compensate by putting effort into those specific classes.

I should go benchmark this on Google Compute or EC2 GPU, but I need to sleep at some point.<p>Intel released a benchmark here: <a href=""http://download.intel.com/design/intarch/PAPERS/324952.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://download.intel.com/design/intarch/PAPERS/324952.pdf</a> claiming they can do 1024-bit ME in 2m cycles, and 512-bit ME in 250k cycles on an i7-2600. Assuming that means you can do 256-bit ME in 32k cycles, that's 100k / sec at 3.4GHz.<p>So an attacker takes a dictionary with 100k passwords in it (or just the top 10k, that works almost as well...) and tests them for each { username, salt, v }.<p>If you can do 100k tests per second, you can test 100k passwords for 100k users (10B tests total) in a little over a day.

We use essentially the same quality that you might see on a Cuchinelli, Zegna or Kiton polo - which retail for $250 - $400 at Niemans or boutiques.  We sell our polos, private label into some high end boutiques for $175 and $195 (retail)- using the same fabric we offer online.  I agree, we need to do a much better job at marketing and branding though.  And I really liked your comments about creating a visceral attachment to the garments.  Stay tuned for that and please stay in touch with us!  Are you in marketing?",1344579591

4365146,comment,4365059,4365059,1,0,6ren,,,"This is a reasonably plausible argument for progress within fields and paradigm shifts; but consider between fields, and the rate of new field creation.  To use the given  examples,  Newtonian physics, quantum physics and Information Theory began in 1687, 1930 and 1948. That seems quite accelerating (of course you'd need more complete stats to demonstrate this properly).<p>BTW: I disagree that intelligence and imagination are separate.  I think intelligence necessarily includes imagination, so AI would include artificial ""imagination"" too.<p>I'd like progress to continue rather than to stagnate; and since progress has historically continued, that seems the way to bet.  Those pundits predicting stagnation have historically been wrong.
However, I find it curious that Kurzweil does not address the <i>availability</i> of innovations/discoveries (and the difficulty in finding them), in contrast to the compelling case he makes for historical progress.  Are potential discoveries infinite?  Is their density uniform, or do they become less likely as you go along because they are limited in supply (the assumption of the article)?<p>How would one sensibly model the supply of potential discoveries, since it is intrinsically unknown? Perhaps a mathematical model of computation might help, of computable functions and Kolomogorov/Solomonoff program length to compute them.  Using this model, the search space of functions increases exponentially with program length - but at what rate would the number of ""interesting"" computable functions increase? And with what density (with respect to the search space, i.e. how hard they are to find)?",1344579412

As you know, it has taken millions to billions of dollars and years of time to develop your project.  We are ready to launch!  As you know, it will take a year to actually deploy it in production, during which point a bug or misconfiguration of the software during the transfer, installation, or activation stages would cause it to fail.  If a failure happens, we will need millions of dollars and lots of time to rebuild the project, as well as to figure out what went wrong and to try again.  However, if we do succeed in installing the project as we hope, we expect will be able to run for ten years without updates.  If you do need an update or if an error is encountered or the hardware deteriorates (such as because of a memory error, hard-drive crash, etc.), then parts of the application never work again.  Also, as a reminder, the user will have to wait many hours after submitting input before receiving acknowledgement from the system, and many days to receive even partial results.""<p>Customer:  ""Thank you for your report.

It adds a good amount to the usability to the page, in my opinion.<p>('label' associates another block of text/html with an input field. So if something says: Name: |_________|, and Name is wrapped in the label tag, clicking on Name is enough to give the textbox focus)",1234623577

Whenever I see ""one cup"" in a recipe I'm 100% baffled. A big cup? A tea cup? One of those larger coffee mugs? Trying to judge what is actually meant here can leads to volumes differing about two to three times in scale.<p>Give me centiliters, desiliters and liters any day.<p>I still have no idea what a cup is. And 50-70 ml seems way too little to make sense, so I will just assume you pulled those numbers out of thin air.",1234622958

> The page-slide animation is eye-candy but IMHO with time it might get annoying, make it optional.<p>The page is utterly useless without JS. I keep JS turned off. It's a good thing I read here about the animation eye candy before trying to turn it on to explore the NYT page. Side-to-side movement on a screen gives me brain seizures. If NYT sticks with this new plan, that will be yet one more site that's off limits to me.<p>If I want movement and eye candy with my news, I can turn on the TV.",1234620857

It's ""The man from earth"".
Not exactly mindfuck material, since it lacks that ""surreal"" element, but at least on my case, each time I finish it I can't help but just sit silent and think about the claims it poses, from a philosophical point of view.
In that sense it could be in the mindflirt-romantic-dinner-with-potential category..",1234620240

5999156,comment,5998675,5998978,6,0,StevenXC,,,"When I tell many people that I do my research in infinite combinatorial games, they immediately assume that my research is more impressive[0] than my officemate&#x27;s research dealing with finite combinatorics. I always move quickly to correct them: dealing with infinity often has the effect of making mathematics easier, and unfairly &quot;trivializes&quot; distinctly difficult problems. After all, in my work, 2^100 is &quot;just finite&quot;, even though that many milliseconds would compose over 40 quintillion years.<p>To your point, I don&#x27;t know the answer of whether the universe is finitely describable or not. But I certainly know it&#x27;s easier to abstract many small aspects of the universe with an approximation by an &quot;infinite model&quot; than to deal with the ridiculously large finite numbers involved.<p>[0] if more useless",1373126399

The commenter made an honest disclosure of a relevant activity, indicating that they have strong feelings about the subject. Discouraging such disclosures doesn&#x27;t prevent parties from having strong feelings, but rather may encourage them to conceal their motivations. People can have feelings, and still maintain honesty in their arguments. Expecting everyone to have a detached objectiveness might be ideal (or might not), but is an unrealistic expectation; entirely impractical in a public debate.",1373126355

Which is what this book is about.<p>As useful as they are for interviews, classic algorithms and data structures are probably not a big part of most peoples work, but understanding how they can be done in python helps you to make assumptions and use libraries in smart ways!<p>Most of all, it&#x27;s fun and well written, for an algorithms book.

Much cooler than their above ground cousins.<p>You see, I live in a country that gets very hot during summers. The ambient goes to 45 easily. And the only sensible solution is to park some place where the sun rays cannot (a) directly hit your car because that would cause the car to become uncomfortably hot (b) cannot be <i>reflected</i> through to your car via multiple other surfaces (e.g. other cars, walls, etc).<p>The underground section of the parking lots perfectly suit this criteria, even though it&#x27;s technically the same building with under-and-over ground parking facilities. If you&#x27;re wondering where I&#x27;m talking about, it&#x27;s the parking lot at the Bahrain City Center.

5999128,comment,5998675,5998978,4,0,tripzilch,,,"What you describe has to do with mathematical constructivism[0], and also with the Axiom of Choice, and it&#x27;s really complicated (to me, I&#x27;m not a mathematician, and I only sort-of get it).<p>You may have heard about the Banach-Tarski paradox[1], which tells you that if you assume &quot;Real numbers&quot; are actually reality, and the Axiom of Choice, you can divide a sphere into five pieces (one of which is just a point) and rearrange them into two spheres of the same volume.<p>Obviously you can&#x27;t do that in reality. This is the point where it gets really complex and I won&#x27;t fill in the details as I understand them, because they are probably wrong.<p>R. Buckminster Fuller also wrote some ideas on this constructivism (or something a lot like it), basically advocating against the set of &quot;Real Numbers&quot; as an accurate depiction of reality. For instance if you make a 1m x 1m square out of a real material. The sides of that square will have N atoms, and the number of atoms (and how far they are apart, which is a property of the material used) is really what describes the length. This is a whole number. But according to geometry math, the <i>diagonal</i> of this square has a length of sqrt(2) metres, or sqrt(2) * N atoms. That can&#x27;t be because you can&#x27;t have an irrational number of atoms. Then what is really going on suddenly depends on how these atoms are packed inside the square, and again, it gets really complex and that&#x27;s where my understanding (of both atomic physics and mathematical constructivism) stops.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(mathematics)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(mathematics)</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach-Tarski_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach-Tarski_paradox</a>",1373125271

Freescale recommends you just cut-and-paste the DDR3 lines directly from their layout.  Partially because the timing is so hard to get right and partially because they don&#x27;t have the bandwidth to help you debug your board layout.  So that&#x27;s probably the biggest hurdle in layout.  TI went a different way with package-on-package RAM mounting, but that&#x27;s another set of headaches when it&#x27;s time to build boards.<p>Another nice part is that you can get working boards today if you want them.  I&#x27;m a big fan of Boundary Devices (<a href=""http://www.boundarydevices.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boundarydevices.com</a>), you can get a SABRE-based board for $99.

Then the framework just fills the controllers field on an incoming request, based on what it finds in the struct tags.  Then you have an interface that allows you to override that behavior, similar to how the json package will use the methods defined in `json.Unmarshaler` if you define them, but will fall back to controlling things by itself with reflection if you don&#x27;t.",1373123066

Feels like a square root might be a better choice if you want to complexify a number.<p>Also, do -any- numbers really exist? They are really just concepts we use to describe the world. Right before me, there are 3 conglomerations of molecules that we would describe as apples, but what does it mean to say the number &#x27;3&#x27; exists? It only really exists in our minds. Pi only describes perfect circles - which don&#x27;t exist.

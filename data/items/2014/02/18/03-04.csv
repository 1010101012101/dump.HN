I expect to move on once I&#x27;ve achieved what I want to with my current project.<p>The problem is not the money per se, but the same problem I see in working for any non-engineering company. There is simply no career path available when your role is perceived as being outside the core mission of the organisation. To progress in academia one must write papers, not software.<p>The NIH has begun recognise the need for funding software and databases, but there seems little prospect of university career structures adapting any time soon. As far as they&#x27;re concerned we&#x27;re only the staff.",1392695929

On the one hand, Apple has more brand recognition and cash than God. On the other hand, when you spend your time dreaming about electric cars, rockets, and hyperloops... who would want to play with laptops?<p>Musk plays the game on an entirely different level.<p>I think Sergey Brin understands this. Google is playing on that level. Self-driving cars, robotics, machine learning, Google Glass, augmented reality, NLP, etc.<p>The future will be a different world, and while Apple shaped much of the last 20 years, I&#x27;m afraid that time is over.",1392695873
7256281,comment,7255579,7256254,3,0,matt_heimer,,,"This is a good switch. Apps can still read and write to external storage, just in an application specific directory. Look at it like this. If you are setting up a Linux server you don&#x27;t run all your apps as root, you run them as non-privileged users. Why? Because an app misbehaving as root is a scary thing. But you also don&#x27;t run all your non-privileged apps under the same user because if one of those apps starts misbehaving and you ran everything as the same user then its almost as bad as running everything as root - one bad app can trash all your data. Android had the same problem with external storage and the android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission - one bad app can trash all your external data. This update will make me much more comfortable installing apps that write to external storage because they can only write to their own external storage as it should be. If an app needs the ability to modify everybodies external storage data doesn&#x27;t that sound like something that would need root permissions on a properly secured Linux system? Why should Android be any different?",1392695856

Not too far from that, to writing it on paper that way.</i><p>No, that&#x27;s not how you use a compass to determine which way you&#x27;re facing.  (Perhaps that&#x27;s what you meant by &quot;or the other way around.&quot;)<p>To use a compass, you turn it until the magnetic needle points to &quot;North&quot; on the dial.  Then you read the heading from the top of the dial, and that&#x27;s the direction you&#x27;re facing.<p>Note that the needle might point in <i>any direction</i>.  <i>The magnetic needle only points ahead (up) if you are facing north.&quot;  What you&#x27;re accomplishing by turning the compass is </i>calibrating* the dial, so that it is aligned with the local magnetic field.  In other words, so that &quot;North&quot; on the dial is actually magnetic north.<p>The only thing that your example says is that you have a strong cultural expectation that north is up.  So you face north, and the compass needle points up.  Circular reference.<p>But suppose we&#x27;d stuck with the traditional European map orientation -- with east being up.  (Hence the verb &quot;to orient,&quot; related to the adjective &quot;oriental.&quot;)  Then we&#x27;d think it perfectly natural for the compass rose to point left.",1392695805

Interesting that the employee gets to partake in the upside but the employer gets the downside, with the exception of course of the employee getting fired.<p>I wonder - if there were really a way to gauge the current market for X talent (sort of a glassdoor salary index) - could employers purchase &quot;insurance&quot; or hedge their hiring price with &quot;employee securities&quot;?",1392695481

That should be enough of a reason for them to think twice.\nAll of this speculation reminds me of the AOL/Time warner or Skype/Ebay mergers. They were lauded as revolutionary at the time, but eventually fell apart when the companies discovered they had nothing in common. So will it be with Apple/Tesla, in my opinion.\nIf Apple wants to make a big, high profile investment that&#x27;s aligned much better with their core business, they should buy an ISP/Mobile Network like Verizon or AT&T.

Simply put: Using Angular everywhere allows us to keep DRY. Testing the front-end using purely Angular is yet another core asset at Thinkful.<p>One framework for writing code and testing is much better than a hybrid of server-side rendering and Angular.<p>Our biggest challenge was SEO, but this was reasonably easily solved with using BromBone (<a href=""http://www.brombone.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brombone.com/</a>).<p>There are reasons to stick with non-angular or JS frameworks, so it&#x27;s not always a slam-dunk.

But that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re optimizing for: We&#x27;re building a phenomenal user-experience that we can support long-term, is well tested, can have a lot of developers use, and can have non-developers do their job inside our codebase (everyone at Thinkful codes).<p>For all this and more Angular has proven a great choice for both logged-in AND public sites.",1392694542

I&#x27;m going to chalk that up to not fully explaining things.<p>The first gallon of water per day I REALLY NEED to drink.  The next I&#x27;d really, really like to have to brush my teeth and wash a bit.  The next 5 gallons I still really want for washing and cooking.  The next 20 are for bathing and laundry.  The next hundred don&#x27;t do me anywhere near as much good and eventually the utility I get from an additional gallon of water goes below the $0.01 per gallon that I pay my utility, so I don&#x27;t use more.<p>This kind of decreasing marginal value happens everywhere in the economy.  For a lot of things (like energy) the demand is nearly flat but for large portions of the economy the demand is highly nonlinear.  In other words, doubling the price might reduce consumption by 80% or more.<p>In those situations if you take the first marginally very valuable portion of the production away from the factory owners they have to raise prices on the rest to recoup their losses.  But the increased prices bring volume down, which could potentially increase prices again.<p>I am sure that there are some situations where the 10% surplus really would be enough to provide for everyone&#x27;s basic needs (however the hell you define that) and not totally fuck over the factory/robot owners.  But there will also be large swaths of the economy where you can&#x27;t.<p>I do think taxes are fundamentally immoral because I can&#x27;t get past the theft-like nature of &quot;pay the taxes or you&#x27;ll go to jail&quot; but I&#x27;m pragmatic and understand that taxes are better than a completely uneducated populace.  And honestly I&#x27;d be much happier with a world where taxes were only 10% in total rather than the 20%-40% that they are now.  I just don&#x27;t think you can feed, clothe, shelter, etc the whole world on 10% of total production.  It would be great and I&#x27;d love to live in that world but I really feel like there&#x27;s something that would prevent it; I can&#x27;t put my finger on it but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s there.",1392694129

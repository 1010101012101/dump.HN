However, overall, I found that for the most part, the points were fairly accurate.  Good comments got a good number of points.  The problems people point to seem to be the exceptions, rather than the rule.<p>My issue is that if you aren't using the points as any indicator of quality, then you've effective made the points useless.  Why display them at all?  They serve no purpose.<p>The problem with this debate, and this pole, is the black and white nature of it.  Either you display points, or you don't.<p>Rather, I'd like to see a solution that balances the two.  Don't display points, but use points under a single topic to figure out the worth of a comment.<p>> If there's no points, everyone has to evaluate it critically and then, that's fine.<p>That seems to be something a lot of ""no-pointers"" are pushing.  Unfortunately, they fail to recognize a few things here.<p>1. People could do that before.<p>2. People are just as like to vote based on preconceived notions.<p>3. People who aren't experts in the field have little information other than what's presented to go on.  Just because someone makes a seemingly good argument doesn't mean they are right.<p>> If someone is being a jerk and incorrect, it's a lot easier to ignore them when they don't have a seemingly-legitimate blessing.<p>4. All comments are given an equal stage.  Even comments that are wrong. (Voting down shouldn't be for disagreements.  Rather, for comments that don't bring value).  Basically, it levels the playing field for a debate between evolutionists and creationists.  It makes them seem as if equals.<p>5. We still dim negative comments.  Any argument for not displaying points needs to account for the dimming of negatively voted comments.  As someone who has been negatively voted into dimness, only to be subsequently upvoted, negative votes being singled out doesn't help matters.<p>People need to split the points and highlights discussion.  Don't display points.  However, use them to highlight comments in a threat.  Base the comment value on the threads point distribution, not on a grand distribution.  Basically, a high quality comment in a low traffic thread will have a different points value from that of a high quality comment in a high traffic thread.",1306799788

Although I suspect you're pretty quick by now, based on your comments) putting together a tight on-point microsite for my consumption.<p>The big job boards are a joke since they have reduced the entire process to buzzword bingo - and a fairly poor form of one at that.

""I didn't think you would have me write code""<p>Huh? Huh? The job description explictly mentions that you need to know free form SQL COLD and asks that you have higher level programming experience (real languages). Do you seriously expect to get a role like that w/o coding?<p>Shoot - beats the cracker jack wanna-be pricing analyst we had apply off monster who explicitly mentioned his pricing experience...at Walmart... as a positive...<p>The one decent player in the online recruiting space that I've seen is linkedin - most of the contacts I've had off of that which show serious intent (eg. tailored message) are pretty promising. Especially if they are a connection of someone you trust.<p>Linkedin's biggest problem is that all participants get the same view of a candidate, including your corporate HR people (don't laugh - I was hauled in and yelled at about this a couple of years ago) - if there was a way to make more of this platform private, the value of the network would increase.",1306799654

In math, there is no distinct ""3"" vs. ""3 + 0"". We can indeed talk about how they are different tokens but there's no second ""3"". There's just the one in conventional systems that most people have heard of, expressable in a countably infinite number of ways (without getting crazy).s<p>(Yes, I know some of the other ones. That's why I said ""conventional systems"", after all.)<p>Math equality not being the same as programmer equality was my entire point. Thanks for elaborating on that theme, I guess? And given that it isn't the same thing, we aren't particularly constrained in how we use our programmer equality except by practical considerations. If we want NaN to == NaN and not === NaN, it's just a matter of making the programming runtime do it. Or vice versa. Or we can simply crash, which actually given how frequently people <i>actually</i> want NaN in Javascript is probably actually the choice I would choose. We aren't constrained by how continuous mathematicians of a certain school think our numbers work, because as programmers we <i>never</i> work with those numbers. We have completely different things going on.

I realized that exceptions are all about giving priority to the optimistic case in the code - making it as clear and simple and with as little branching as possible.   However after seeing projects through a full lifecycle (from initial conception through to maintenance in production) I now realize that the <i>really</i> important code - the code that we spend most of our time trying to figure out in maintenance over the lifetime of the application and whose state is most hard to understand and deal with - is <i>in fact</i> the error handling code and that exceptions focus on hiding that code and making it ""disappear"" and seem implicit.

Every year for the Master's, some folks temporarily rent out their houses because the Master's (golf tournament) brings so many visitors to Augusta that the hotel market can't adequately serve it.  It's a once a year event lasting about 2 weeks and the rest of the time the hotels are perfectly adequate to the needs of the city.  The houses that are deemed the most desirable for this purpose are not those in the city core but those in walking distance of the golf course.  The city is a madhouse during the Master's and traffic is insane (god help you if you need to make a left hand turn on the main drag that goes down to the golf course).  Some residents rent out their house because you can temporarily get a premium price, enough to pay for you to go vacation elsewhere and not have to put up with this insanity.  I have difficulty imagining another means to adequately meet the ridiculously high rental demand for this brief annual period.<p>I know it's an unusual situation, but it makes me wonder if it's really ""all downside"" so to speak.

I question the rationality of keeping the shuttle fleet flying when it consistently proved to be suboptimal for various roles they were required to perform. The only reason to have a shuttle is to bring down a bus-sized object from space. Every other role can be performed by either unmanned cargo ships or expendable small capsules. The money spent on an unneeded fleet drained resources from other projects. Instead of a fleet of modular vehicles that could be tailored to the mission at hand, we ended up with a fleet of 70-ton reusable cargo holder.<p>Don't get me wrong. It's a beautiful machine.

Spending a lot of time on it, sure, but other than it being quirky (which is hugely valuable) is it doing it's job? No specific accomplishments, core skills, and no software in the wild for us to see.<p>You could have linked to your Airbnb profile (""hey i use it!"") linked to your google map (""hey i travel!"") and then listed all your software projects and links and things about each that you are especially proud of, and that'd have been awesome.",1306796428

Three times. I wish I'd taken bad_user's comment on face value but your comment and the author's comments made me read it.<p>Whole chapters were squirming before my eyes that seemed to make a single tiny point. Was I missing some gem of knowledge to unlock the shockingly badly written conclusion (otherwise known in writer circles as 'Um, what was I saying?')? Whole rambling diatribes could have been cut down to single sentences ('Building a Deck' and 'The Miracle Deck', I'm looking at you.). A little of my soul died inside.

This is from 2006 and it shows.",1306796422

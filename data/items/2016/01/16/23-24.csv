If too many people are queuing, so this mass extends to the platforms, it might not be safe to let a train depart.<p>Anecdote: During rush hour, I was almost at the bottom of an escalator at Oxford Circus station, when a women a little ahead of me fell over, and the man in front of me fell over her.  I pressed the emergency stop button, and blocked the way for people coming down until someone had helped the woman stand.<p>Less than a minute later, a London Underground employee finds me on the platform and thanks me for acting quickly¹.  He says the crowding at the top of the escalator — in a minute! — means the station has been partially closed &quot;exit and interchange only&quot;.  (Probably only for five minutes.)",1452988781

(6502, 1mhz, 128K RAM)<p>A quick look at the high end software and it&#x27;s advanced, integrated, data and code driven features shows a lot of new capability.  You might not see much of it in AutoCAD, but it&#x27;s out there.<p>In terms of being able to get the right information to the right people at the right time, what we&#x27;ve got today is absolutely huge compared to those times.  In addition to geometry, it&#x27;s possible to drive multiple, well integrated datasets from the core models and their intent, and it&#x27;s possible to do so with code, or human input, or some data capture or other.<p>It&#x27;s possible to make CAM ready models on a phone, and do so with a pretty capable geometry engine.  An old wireframe type system really doesn&#x27;t even compare.<p>One of the bigger improvements comes from the lightweight visualization pioneered in the early 90&#x27;s.  That same phone can render your site, with any combination of data needed, and do so in real time, and it can allow measure, move, markup and a lot of other basic things.  There is no need for paper in a ton of use cases.<p>Back in those days, everybody needed paper.  Lots.  Of.  Paper.<p>In the compute / design optimization space, integrating analysis software with CAD software has brought the ability to design, then simulate and automatically refine and tune models computationally.  This can even be made cookie cutter, so that experienced analysis people can boil things down to help less experienced people out.  That, plus design rule checks that actually are based on meaningful data from the solid models, means more and higher level design is more accessible to more people.<p>Geometrically, buildings are kind of simple most of the time.  However, if one wants to actually express intent, and derive them computationally, the same kinds of problems exist as they do for, say the product space, or auto / aero.<p>When it comes to actually making more complex things and changing them, systems today can infer so much that prior generations of software could not.  I have a hard time even describing how important and time saving this is.<p>And data?<p>Hell, what kind of data do you have?  Real model, paper sketch, photograph, old wireframe, solids, surfaces, tabular data... ?  The better systems can use any and all of it, and can do so in a robust, most always parametric, and associative way.  (the latter, if desired, and that&#x27;s not always desired)<p>Now, having been there, I can use an old system to build a lot of stuff today.  Most of my younger peers would not even know where to begin.  Good.  They get a much improved workflow that is an order smarter than anything I ever saw from that time period.<p>Really, I&#x27;m not entirely sure you&#x27;ve seen advanced CAD.  Autodesk isn&#x27;t there yet, but they are working hard right now.  Good things happening.  It will take them a while, as I&#x27;ve mentioned already.  A quick look at what the top two can actually do (Siemens Dassault) will show tons of smarts present now, not present or even possible then.<p>For experienced people, there is a whole lot there.  Not just the surface either.  For inexperienced people, it&#x27;s growing very accessible now.  The number of use cases for &quot;non CAD&quot; people to successfully interact with and operate using data from a CAD model is way up and growing.<p>That same phone, when not used to create something, could very easily deliver all the data somebody needs to do something, and they themselves can learn how to get anything they might need from that model too.  It&#x27;s just not anywhere near as hard as it once was, and paper finally isn&#x27;t really needed.",1452988050

However, done to excess would imply doing things you hate all the time, against the peril of doing things you hate more, which will make your life miserable.<p>This line of thinking reminds me of most school systems, which uses somewhat the same strategy, ie. do this simple task, now, or in the immediate future, to some exact specification, and if you don&#x27;t do it properly you&#x27;ll get a bad grade.<p>I find it much more helpful to tread lightly when considering doing things you don&#x27;t like in order to accomplish a goal.

I remember taking my first moral philosophy class in university, and much to my surprise, it was one of the most engaging classes I ever took precisely because it challenged everything I thought I knew. The professor could have spent the time teaching us what to think (e.g. just what the major moral philosophy theories are) but instead she used the socratic method and challenged each of us about what we already believed and how those philosophers like Kant came to their theories.<p>Indeed, intellectual and moral relativism is dangerous because it does the same thing religion does, it is a method of coming to knowledge/truth (an epistemology) that no one else has access to and/or that relies on subjective evidence (i.e. emotions/feelings).",1452987059

Not just drawings and models.  Intent.<p>It&#x27;s entirely possible to package up a ton of stuff that can be used to assemble a project, and when that&#x27;s done, those packages can drive all the info needed by the contractors each day, if desired.  This technique was applied to a major airport we probably both know, and it was done on mechanical CAD for those reasons.  The bid was more accurate, and the project ran much closer to on time and on materials.<p>Buildings are sort of dumb and sort of simple too.  Of course, in the one time, forward create kind of way, sure.  It&#x27;s just a pile of simple geometry.  On the other hand, if one actually wants to move up a level, add intent, build in design rule checks, etc... suddenly, you&#x27;ve got a class of buildings possible, those buildings largely derived from set pieces, with the real design effort being more centered on the unique aspects of a given site.<p>Couple this with a bid process that is driven off that same intent, and doing prospective designs starts to change.  Not only do they get a realistic idea of the design outcome, but they get bids, materials, etc... that are closer to real, and derived from a team with a history of doing that.<p>I never classified anyone as idiots.  I see it more like being too conservative.  Happens in mechanical spaces too.<p>It&#x27;s just process pieces that are laying around waiting for people to make better use of them.  Many are fat &#x27;n happy, so they don&#x27;t.  Others, particularly in the strategic project space, really are looking for better ways to get things done, and done on time and on budget.<p>Real property has it&#x27;s own set of requirements to deal with, but in the end, they are just requirements.  Employing more of what the tools can do really can have an impact.  I&#x27;ve been a part of a couple of those, and the results were pretty impressive.  Coordinating those humans, once you&#x27;ve got a dataset that is live, real time, able to iterate based on variances that just happen with property, doesn&#x27;t look a whole lot different from that same process in the product space.<p>Manufacturing, and the product space in general, struggles with this same thing, and there have been significant improvements in overall communications in the last 10 years that are just now really starting to see wider use.  All electronic shops are here now.  10 years ago, there were a few, and some concept places, but most everybody was slogging through the piles of paper and high latency, high labor means and methods.  Ugly stuff.<p>Today, it&#x27;s possible for a CAD dataset to drive all of it.  And parts of that are still ugly, but improving.  AEC can do this too.  Again, it&#x27;s being done by a few progressive groups out there, and that&#x27;s direct experience.  I happened to be one of the Mechanical CAD guys willing to work with them and translate techniques, and understand their scenario, language, requirements, etc...<p>Hey, this also ties in with boats...<p>So, when a yacht gets made, it&#x27;s custom.  They do ungodly hacks during actual construction.  The less up front planning and visualization work they do, the more hacks there are.  &quot;Just make it fit, and send the result back to engineering...&quot;  Fine.  Each boat ships with a document set that basically attempts to detail what happened and why.  Tons of books.<p>One artifact of the CAD process was planning more of those hacks away.  Another was packaging up core bits where intent can be well defined.  And the docs were derived from all that, then more lightly marked up.  All electronic, with a paper back up, just because the sea.  The sea is toxic.  But, it cost a lot less to do just a little bit more up front.<p>Forward 5-6 years, I ended up in a scenario where it worked the same way with a building.  (I have a dataset of a library in SF that I helped figure out how to work on.) They got their site study docs, and then drove the CAD from there, building in options, expressing intent, etc...  On the prospect walk through, they were able to make real time changes and sell that deal.  Potent stuff.  I heard a lot about &quot;client didn&#x27;t pay&quot; and being able to work directly with them, real time, can change that equation.  And each project, sold or not, does produce a lot of great stuff that can be used on future ones too.  One example might be that parking garage I mentioned.  Property varies a lot.  However, it is possible to build a parking structure with a lot of flexibility and design rule checks that can fit into a lot of scenarios.  Worst case, it&#x27;s an 80 percent basis, for the 20 percent real work of dealing with that particular site.<p>When site construction began, a computer went to live there and all the coordination, handling of problems, documenting variances, distribution of materials, measure, etc... happened on it.  Sometimes drawings got output, maybe for the more device toxic tasks (and that gets tossed when work is done), and a lot of people read 3D data and worked from it directly on a laptop or pad.  Walk on site, pull up model, expose the relevant bits, compare, measure, do.<p>When the building is done?  Computer stays there.  It&#x27;s the living record of the thing.<p>Employing these means can yield the ability for doing more than one project at a time too, or at the least, more projects, faster, with fewer people.<p>Right now, cars, airplanes and other big things also have those living records too.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to get at here is the clusterfuck of CAD (and it&#x27;s often just that) has a lot to do with how connected and fluid and accessible the data is to people.  When the people can work from the data, and that data is derived from the model and the intent in that model, a whole lot of that clusterfuck goes away.<p>I think, after having this very interesting chat, the desire to realize a more compute oriented approach has some elements in common with just making the CAD more widely and directly usable by most people, not just CAD people.",1452986256

The transplanted cells don&#x27;t stick around for long, but suppress inflammation and oxidative stress, encourage regeneration, etc, by changing the behavior of native cells.

To elucidate the mechanism of hair graying, we investigated gene expression related to melanogenesis in human hair. The key molecules in melanogenesis, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor-M (MITF-M), Sox10, Pax3, tyrosine related protein-1 (TRP-1), and tyrosinase, were absent or greatly reduced in the bulbs of white hair compared to black hair. Melanocyte stem cells (MSCs) or melanocytes express markers for neural crest cells, Sox10, Pax3, and MITF-M.

The build up of hydrogen peroxide was caused by a reduction of an enzyme that breaks up hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen (catalase). Hair follicles could not repair the damage caused by the hydrogen peroxide because of low levels of enzymes that normally serve this function (MSR A and B). Further complicating matters, the high levels of hydrogen peroxide and low levels of MSR A and B, disrupt the formation of an enzyme (tyrosinase) that leads to the production of melanin in hair follicles. Melanin is the pigment responsible for hair color, skin color, and eye color. The report shows that this massive accumulation of hydrogen peroxide can be remedied with a proprietary treatment developed by the researchers described as a topical, UVB-activated compound called PC-KUS (a modified pseudocatalase). What&#x27;s more, the study also shows that the same treatment works for the skin condition, vitiligo.&quot;",1452985908

This is probably the oldest part of the standard library and the original design predated both templates and exceptions, so it had to do with virtual functions and error states. I wish we could have better library in the standard. If I needed performance, I would rather use a third party I/O library over stdio, which is a security nightmare.<p>> There isn&#x27;t a single &quot;modernist&quot; style in C++, there are dozens of permutations\nAll complex languages have several styles, so it&#x27;s not just a feature of C. Take a look at Scala (mutable vs immutable objects), Haskell (recursion vs. folding, lambdas vs. point-free) or even Javascript (callback-hell vs. promises vs. generators vs. async/await) and it&#x27;s not so different than C++. If you want one style to rule them all, there&#x27;s always Go.<p>> More than half of the really difficult problems we encountered were C++-only, relating to constructs that didn&#x27;t exist or were simpler in C.\nYes, constructs like classes or templates don&#x27;t exist in C, but their warts are generally born out of the requirement for C compatibility.\nExcruciating long compile time? Due to compatibility with C&#x27;s preprocessor-based &quot;module system&quot;.\nPrivate variables and methods have to appear in header files? Again, wouldn&#x27;t be an issue if not for the mandated module system inherited from C.\nWeird template errors? Compatibility with C types made introducing constraints is quite hard (that&#x27;s one of the reasons Concepts are languishing in the standards committee I guess).<p>> And some of the most exploitable software out there like Adobe Flash is written in the oh-so-safe C++ rather than the evil old C.\nThis software is more likely written in C with a sprinkle of C++ classes, lots of manual memory managements and, raw C arrays, C library calls and so on. My experience might not be representative enough, but the developers who tend to write this kind of malloc-happy code are the same developers who hate templates, exceptions and RAAI. You might as well call them C developers in a sheepskin.",1452985588

Not only is it scientifically inappropriate to reject &quot;Aliens did it!&quot; as a hypothesis or to assign it an arbitrary (un)likelihood, but IMO we shouldn&#x27;t even be surprised if that turns out to be the case.

You are not listed for spamming or for anything you have done. The PBL is simply a list of all of the world&#x27;s dynamic IP space, i.e: IP ranges normally assigned to ISP broadband customers (DSL, DHCP, PPP, cable, dialup). It is perfectly normal for dynamic IP addresses to be listed on the PBL. In fact all dynamic IP addresses in the world should be on the PBL. Even static IPs which do not send mail should be listed in the PBL.&quot;<p>So, in this tool, presumably any dynamic IP will turn up as &quot;Listed in spamhaus PBL&quot;, which might cause some undue alarm to the uninformed.

9457240,comment,9456931,9457162,0,0,laumars,,,"<i>> But it looks like Go has done similar things in the past. For example, the slicing operation gained an additional optional argument (<a href=""https://golang.org/doc/go1.2#three_index"" rel=""nofollow"">https://golang.org/doc/go1.2#three_index</a>). It&#x27;s not exactly the same thing, but it seems roughly in the same league of difficulty.</i><p>It&#x27;s not really same in my opinion. Slices already accepted multiple parameters - or even none. So adding another optional parameter doesn&#x27;t affect the syntax. Where as import names are all stored in a single quoted string, so you&#x27;d have to rethink the entire structure of the import syntax (which leaves you with two import different methods of expressing imports - which is messy) or use some nasty kludge of including versioning within the import string.<p>What&#x27;s more versioning is only half the story here. There&#x27;s other issues with Go&#x27;s imports that this author aims to resolve - such as the dependency on a static repo. Because import paths are based directly on the repo path (eg github.com) it makes it a pain to prototype code in a private repository before pushing changes public. And then there&#x27;s issues with dependency on any specific resource (you can&#x27;t use mirrored repos with <i>go get</i>), plus a whole slew of related issues regarding hard-coded repo paths.<p>So versioning is only half the story.<p><i>> Based on what I&#x27;m reading, versioning is a serious pain point. Sure, you always have to make sure the payoff is worth the additional complexity (universally, not just in Go) but the author seems to categorically disqualify this option by incorrectly saying that it would break backwards compatibility.</i><p>Well I&#x27;ve already argued that any clean solution would break backwards compatibility and any kludge would be messy and rather short sighted (plus potentially may not address the other issues with <i>go get</i> and <i>import()</i>).<p>So I think it&#x27;s a little misjudged for you to say he&#x27;s &quot;incorrect&quot; in his opinion in the way that you have.",1430301271

From the gb GitHub:<p>> A project is the consumer of your own source code, and possibly dependencies that your code consumes; nothing consumes the code from a project.<p>This seems to imply that any code <i>outside</i> of a project (i.e. the code inside vendor/src) has no recourse for indicating the versions of their dependencies. This is nice in that it simplifies the problem, but to completely remove the ability for any and all libraries to indicate the versions of their dependencies seems unnecessarily restrictive. If I build a library for others to use, and I have a dependency, I want to be be able to lock to a specific version, or at least give my preference for a version.<p>Of course, this creates its own issues - what do you do when two libraries depend on two different versions of the same library? (Also known as the diamond dependency problem.) This is where the Go culture helps, where as long as you pick a later version, things are likely to work. But I&#x27;d rather have the tooling let me detect the two versions that the two libraries want, show that there is a mismatch, and give me the ability to override and pick one (probably the later one). Instead, the gb approach eliminates the ability for the libraries to even have the ability to indicate what version they would prefer, which makes it even more difficult to get a bunch of libraries that share dependencies to work correctly together.<p>godep (<a href=""https://github.com/tools/godep"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tools/godep</a>) seems to have the best compromise: vendor dependencies without path rewriting (though with GOPATH rewriting), but also keep track of their versions in a Godep.json file.

It&#x27;s also about tracking changes, accountability on a larger scale.<p>I manage quite a few servers, all running different in-house developed services. Almost all configurations are completely different, with a few exceptions, but I am still automating them. Just leaving it like it is, all manually managed would probably save me a lot of time, so why do I do it? So it can first be deployed on some test VM&#x27;s, and when someone changes a configuration, I can track it in git/svn/.. and see who committed what change. It would only save me time if I had to deploy service X more than 3 or 4 times (dev/test/qa/prod), but as it stands, nop. Timesink it is.",1430298066

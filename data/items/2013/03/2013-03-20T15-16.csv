5408064,comment,5407149,5407149,4,0,jbarmash,,,"Another way to keep sharp, which surely Peter knows (as he runs several meetups in NYC), is to encourage your team to get involved with local meetups, both as an attendee and a presenter, or do other community-oriented stuff like teaching classes (e.g. skillshare). This has two positive effects  increases the flow of new ideas, and (when speaking) helps your company / team to get more visibility in the community.<p>While I am very supportive of learning and using cutting edge technologies when it makes sense, it does need to balanced with technical risk assessment, which your post alludes to at the end. For example, say you want to try the Rust language and think it would give you some advantage. Things like maturity / community, etc, definitely come into play.<p>Innovation comes not just from using new technologies, but also from using new techniques with old boring technologies. Id even argue that working on cutting-edge problems forces you to innovate, alleviating some of the innovation debt issue (not everybody has that issue).<p>You can innovate on nonfunctional areas, such as devops, logging, metrics, etc, if your core business needs to be more conservative.<p>One of the best talks I went to in the last year was by CTO of Etsy, where he talked about how they use the most boring technologies they can find  php, mysql, etc. At the same time, Etsy has a very strong reputation in the tech community.

5408054,comment,5407319,5407319,5,0,charmcitygavin,,,"A couple years ago, while working toward a creative writing/publishing MFA, I found an IBM Selectric II on Craigslist. I'd done all my writing on computers up to that point, but I loved the idea of using a typewriter for first drafts. There was something romantic about the idea. It seemed like a more intimate way to write.<p>Its owner was a retiree moving to Florida. He'd bought it in the late 60s to write his dissertation but hadn't used it since. It had sat in a corner of his office under its original dust cover for forty years, though he'd had it serviced a few months earlier.<p>The first thing I noticed was the weight of the thing when I carried it out to my car. It's a tank. The second thing I noticed was the sound it made when I brought it home and switched it on. There was no mistake I was dealing with a piece of machinery, humming, waiting for me to get to work. It looked great, too.<p>As soon as I sat down to write, I worried that it would bother my neighbors. My apartment walls were thin enough that I could hear anything louder than a cough, so when I discovered that typing each letter was like firing a cannon, it was clear that late-night writing sessions were out of the picture unless I wanted to make enemies.<p>But I was right about using it for first drafts. On the computer, it's easy to second-guess myself, go back, change things, and re-write too much before the story is even finished. A first draft is supposed to be the shitty, rough, inconsistent sketch of a thing, and my Selectric forces me to press onward. It's awesome. Each key press is satisfying, each carriage return is a mechanical thunk that lets me know I'm making progress. Watching pages stack up on the desk next to it is a reward itself.<p>I still do my rewrites and edits on my computer, copying from the typed pages, but I'm so happy that I have this monster machine to keep me honest and get the first versions of stories down.",1363795092

After a bunch of reading and thinking and doing (ie practice) it seems much easier to deal with pain and discomfort.  They are both still there, but if it's 20 degrees to cold for my clothing it's not that big a deal and awkward situations are actually pretty funny now, even in the moment.<p>So, the Taoist stuff deals mostly with the nature of reality. Buddhism tends to run the gamut but has a lot to do with your experience, and Epicureanism is sorta like Buddhism, but with more heavy language and serious attempts to remove any hint of internal conflict and paradoxical teaching (those can both be handy teaching tools).<p>All of them, to varying degrees, teach that you can alleviate suffering through proper response, though it might be more accurate to say you can refrain from creating more suffering.  The mind is like the body.  When you get cut you clean it and bandage it and leave the thing alone.  Anything else directly messing with it is just hindering the process, however, you can help yourself by doing things like making sure you have a good diet and get plenty of rest.  The above three teach you about diet and rest and so on, but for your person.",1363795084

They are supposed to decide based on what the law says, regardless of the result. If you disagree with the <i>law</i>, then write to Congress.<p>But it's fair to ask whether this will produce better or worse results. It's a good observation that this will cause publishers to shift out of poorer markets and increase the use of DRM[1].<p>The previous situation was not perfect though, either. To interpret that statute geographically would be a major restriction on trade; and if not, would create a lot of ambiguity. Nobody wants to purchase something from another country if they are worried that the manufacturer will come in later and take it away because it had some copyrighted design (which could be anything) on it somewhere.<p>I believe the results will be better overall (by a lot) under the new interpretation of the law. Clarity and simplicity about where you stand as the owner of property is incredibly important.<p>One way to think about it is that nothing has changed. The publisher can still create a contract with the buyer that says they won't resell it in another region. It's just that the ""default"" purchase contract does not give the publisher that right. And we should make defaults match expectations as closely as possible, otherwise people are entering into contracts they don't understand. The notion of purchasing a product has many expectations that go with it that have been developed over millennia. To allow the publishers to inject extra terms that contradict those expectations just to fit their particular business model is ridiculous.<p>[1] Though DRM wouldn't be nearly as bad if there were no DMCA and if the sellers were forced to call it ""licensing"" rather than ""buying"". Again, the default purchasing contract should match the expectations of both parties.",1363794486

As long as you have paying customers, recruiting isn't as big of a problem as people make it out to be. Is this a problem for places like Google and Facebook? Sure. For you start-up, probably not. Software challenges tend to trail off towards the latter part of the software's life cycle.

There are some serious implications with letting people's innovative brains wander too far when given a specific task to accomplish. This is why hackathons and ""FedEx"" days are so popular. It's a mutual agreement between employer and employee that says: ""You are allowed to hack something together with new exciting technology but I cannot guarantee it will reach the production stack""<p>I think this idea of innovation debt is a clear non-problem for me and most web based startups in my situation.",1363794484

5407926,comment,5407319,5407319,4,0,nollidge,,,"Just bought myself a Seletric II off of Ebay a couple weeks ago. The thing is magnificent. The only electrical component is the motor running the driveshaft, otherwise all of the operations are mechanical. For example, pressing a key makes the type head pitch and yaw to the proper character, then lifts and slams it against the paper, all within a few dozen milliseconds, and that whole process is done with just levers and pulleys (clutching off the driveshaft, too, I'm sure). There's even a buffer mechanism, so that if you hit a key while the type mechanism is in the middle of printing the previous character, it's actually ""stored"" in this buffer until the print head is done with that cycle. AND, if the buffer is full (I believe it only stores one character), then all the keys are locked to prevent any mishaps.<p>And the maintainability of the thing is pretty nifty - you can take the cover off, and then lift and slide the guts up from the base[0] to stand upright with the bottom facing you. All by-design, since of course such mechanical objects require regular lubrication and other maintenance.<p>[0] See this video (I linked to 3:35, but the whole thing is cool): <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=uB3sM2cA6Wk#t=215s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v...</a>",1363794186

This is frustrating because you -- like every other human -- react much better to praise than to scorn. But here's the leap you need to make:  when you have someone taking the time to criticize you in depth, it's because THEY WANT YOU TO SUCCEED.  (If they didn't want you to succeed, they wouldn't bother reporting their experiences to you, because they wouldn't actually want you to fix them!)<p>So as hard as they can be to read sometimes, experiences like the one you replied to are actually essential to you and your project:  it is someone who wants you to succeed explaining in detail how you fall short.

He produced Lineage II, City of Heroes, City of Villains, and Tabula Rasa. City of Heroes gained a cult, if small, following, and both Tabula Rasa and Lineage II were commercial failures. Lineage II in particular was savaged by both gamers and the gaming press - 6.7/10 by IGN, 6.0/10 by GameSpot, 62% on Metacritic.<p>But don't take my word for it, this is lifted from the Wikipedia article:<p>""Scott Stahl of the The Daily Orange praised the game's graphics and design, though he also mentioned that the game ""quickly degrades into an incredibly tedious and monotonous process of killing the same monster a thousand different times"", and that the character creation options are ""incredibly shallow, with maybe two or three different faces and hair styles for each type of character."" Andrew Park of Gamespot said that the game ""offers either a repetitive grind or a stiff challenge""""<p>By all accounts, Garriott's seemingly unquestionable sense of game design seems to fall apart when he left the Ultima series. I very gladly accept that he was/is one of the top game designers the industry has seen, but treating like ""there's no one else like him on this planet"" is unreasonable.<p>Secondly,<p>> <i>""When there are threads on forums about one game to pick if you had to choose only one (which is very hard to do, but that's the game: pick one and only), if you had to choose ""the best game ever"", well very often people will cite an Ultima.""</i><p>Citation sorely needed. If you went solely to a RPG forum, and specifically excluded JRPG aficionados, then you'd probably get a lot of answers to the tune of ""Ultima"". There have been many ""top video games <i>evar</i>"" lists made both by the gaming press and by vote participation, and I've yet to see Ultima top any of them.<p>There's a lot more to video gaming than ""old school RPGs"".",1363794042

In graduate school, my thesis focused on the Southeast US from Reconstruction through the Civil Rights Act of 1964, investigating the role religion played in the development, acceptance, and perpetuation of the Souths attitudes and behaviors toward race, class, and gender. I get on guys' cases all the time when they're being obliquely and overtly sexist, <i>especially</i> in mixed company. I also point out to women when they're putting up with sexist behavior, because it's so ingrained in our culture that too few even recognize it properly. To say I'm pretty well steeped in both the academic and practical sides of gender politics, identity, and sexism would put it rather mildly.<p>However, I don't go ape-shit and publicly humiliate someone for making a potentially sexist joke among friends, because I have spent years rationally and academically evaluating whether or not someone is actually attempting to propagate bigotry and discriminatory behaviors--<i>and this is the baseline for sexism</i>, not whether or not a person approves of a statement that includes anatomical or sexual content. To reiterate, years of studying gender issues from a historical and philosophical perspective have shown rather conclusively that not everything sex-related is sexist.<p>The ""big dongle"" statement was <i>not</i> in any way a 'sexist joke'. It was an anatomical joke, albeit a childish one on the level of potty humor. Anatomy != sexism.<p>The forking comment, as explained by mr-hank, was not in the slightest bit sexist. Forking is the sincerest form of flattery (short of implementation, that is). People talk about forking repos all the time. I ask people if they've ""forked [person's] repo"" on the regular. I honestly don't even care if the guy said, ""I'd fork his repo"" in that typical, suggestive tone-of-voice. Why? Because for all I know as an outsider, the guys having the conversation could be homosexual, and not to put too fine a point on it, but homosexual men have been the victims of some absolutely disgusting and horrific sexism and discrimination (and much worse). Also, homosexual men don't heavily trend toward making lewd comments that are directed at women, especially where dick comments are concerned.<p>But even beyond trying to keep that consideration in mind, dick jokes or comments that are made between men without any obvious sign that the potentially offending comment is intended to be overheard ought to give everyone pause before sounding the Sexism Alert. Yes, guys talk about dicks at times and in places that are probably not appropriate. Kind of the way children talk about poop and farts and pee at times and in places that are probably not appropriate.<p>You know what else I hear a fuckton of at times and in places that are not appropriate? Breasts. Penises. Sluts. Periods. Boyfriend issues. Husband problems. Boob jobs. Male celebrity fantasies. <i>50 Fucking Shades of Grey</i>. All of these from <i>women</i>. All the time--in offices, conferences, churches, cafes, restaurants, bars ... you name it. You wanna know how frequently I hear women talk about breasts (theirs or someone else's), or periods (theirs or someone else's), or the ways in which [insert body part] is changing during pregnancy, or how hot [insert attractive male celebrity] is, or how juicy <i>50 Shades</i> is? It's <i>everywhere</i>.<p>Moreover, I can't even count the number of times I am in professional meetings with clients and notice [mostly younger] women adjusting their bras right in the middle of the meeting. Hey, I know those things get damn uncomfortable, ladies, but it also gets uncomfortable sitting through a meeting for two hours, crossing and uncrossing my legs to give my dick some space to not be a total pain <i>just for existing between my legs</i>. And guess what I <i>never</i> do? Adjust in the presence of women. Ever.<p>And to be perfectly transparent, I usually ignore it all. I'm one who pretty much defaults to giving women a pass because of all the stupid shit they've dealt with over a long history of men being complete assholes. I mean, really. A woman could make the most sexist comment I've ever heard and I'd just give it a shrug; but I'd say shit to a man if he was even obliquely offensive.<p>And yet, on this one, sounding the alarm was wrong. This wasn't sexism. Inappropriate? Sure, I'll grant Adria that. There were way too many people surrounding the exchange that it would have been better to not make the dongle comment--especially given that there was a woman in close proximity (and that's not a sly way of suggesting they should have made the comment if a woman was not in close proximity). It was an improper forum for such a comment. But to turn around and smile and take a picture, post it to Twitter, and then continue on calling oneself Joan of Arc? Christ, that is beyond the pale.<p>Just as the men who made the childish dongle comment agreed to a Code of Conduct, so did Adria. And just as she wanted them to abide by the Code, so should she have. I don't recall there being anything in the Code of Conduct that said one had the option to A) inform conference staff, or B) post a person's picture to Twitter if they say something you don't want to hear.<p>[edit: spelling errors & wording]",1363793910

You have multiple designers working on multiple systems, and then you have a layer of management who wants to hold some of your feature ideas for their DLC monetization strategy down the line, and you need to maybe break some of your systems in order to add social media integration options or compromise on your core ideas in order to create some integration that can justify the always online DRM that you need to put in place.<p>When Richard was making Ultima, he could just say no.  Well, up to a point anyways.  By Ultima 7 and origin's acquisition by EA, references to difficulties with EA even bubbled into the game.  I mean the main antagonists were named Elizabeth and Abraham.  Origin's tagline was ""We create worlds"" the evil force in the game was known as the destroyer of worlds.<p>Even if you're skeptical about that, nobody can doubt that the quality of Ultima 8 and 9 were, at least in terms of game design, quite poor.  Was that because Richard all of a sudden became one of those bad game designers? Or was that because the design of the game became more committee based and had to cater to focus groups and demographics determined from on high.<p>Maybe Richard had to work with other bad designers.  But that's just how things work now.  It's just that because you can't work by yourself so much any more, the quality of management and other designers directly influence people's perception of you.  I mean, if Richard were to be judged, instead of by his work on Ultima 1-7 but by his work on games like Ultima 8-9, Lineage 2, CoH/CoV, Tabula Rasa, his highly anticipated ""Ultimate Collector"" someone might consider him a designer who sucks.<p>It's not the designers who necessarily sucks, it's the ecosystem that allows sucky design to persevere.  In the 80s if you had a designer who sucked, they made a game who sucked. Today if you have a designer who sucks, you have one more bad system in an otherwise good game. That becomes tolerated and users are willing to get yet another bad system in a good game, until the games become a mass of ""could have been nice"" features that end up poorly realized, rushed, or retooled to appeal to a wide audience.",1363793761

Systems, information, decision, risk and queuing theory when correctly applied to product design and development can yield transformative results, in a similar way that companies like Toyota transformed manufacturing process using similar principles to optimise for just-in-time production vs economies of scale.<p>Unfortunately, you are unlikely to find such information in most of the literature around Agile methodologies, blogs or the army of consultants that roam the earth much less your average Scrum Master. Cargo-culting is rife in most the companies I have seen, even where the adoption of agile principles and methodologies have a significant positive effect on a team's effectiveness. I'd have to classify myself as a cargo-culter in the beginning too when I first exposed to working in Agile team taking an eXtreme Programming approach some years ago.<p>Unfortunately, herein lies the problem. For many people it does work (whether you like it or not) and as you say, it takes on the characteristics of a religion - people experience ""better"" and are just happy to keep following a recipe for ""success"", without understanding WHY. Obviously, this leads to people trying to replicate such ""success"" in a different context and when things go wrong they don't know how to fix it - they don't have a deep enough understanding of how to re-apply the principles and and normally they are optimising for the WRONG thing.<p>There are valid proven theories behind why working in iterative cycles, limiting work-in-process, shipping working code in the production regularly and self-organising teams lead to better results - you just won't hear why from most of the Agile evangelists in this world but there are answers out there if you look for them. Instead your typical Scrum Masters   obsess about far more trivial and unimportant things like how to phrase the title of a story card, retrospective formats, burn down charts and velocity points.<p>If you can be bothered to look a bit deeper, then just avoid using the ""A"" word in your searches. ;-)<p>Here is one book, if you can get past the rather dry and academic natural to get you started. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Managing-Design-Factory-Donald-Reinertsen/dp/0684839911"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Managing-Design-Factory-Donald-Reinert...</a><p>P.S.

5407858,comment,5403988,5406114,14,0,caffeine5150,,,"In graduate school, I took a class on evolutionary biology.  One of the principles put forth was that women (think cave women) evolved to focus on seeking a mate that provided time and resources because women are more focused on the long-term reproduction strategy of investing in their offspring and want a mate to help maximize their success (i.e. that offspring surviving to reproduce). Both men and women were shown to engage in both short and long term reproduction strategies of sorts.  Men sleeping around (short term) and supporting a child (long term).  Women supporting a child with a mate's help (long term) and sneaking out on mate to have sex with genetically superior mate (short term).  One of the supporting studies showed that in a list of things that would most anger a man or women relative to their mate, men rated sexual infidelity as number one (this is in part because men have paternal uncertainty and their worst outcome is investing in the long term strategy of raising another male's child).  Women listed sexual infidelity as somewhere in the top few, but number one was their mate spending time/money/resources on another woman.  For example, imagining their guy taking another woman out to dinner, spending time and thought on her, buying her a gift, etc. upset them more than the thought of him simply have sex with a women he wasn't otherwise invested in.  Within this theory, an expensive diamond communicates that the male is making a large investment and communicates to other women that the woman with the diamond is worthy of that large investment.  In real life, women of course range from ""don't care or think that way"" or ""achieve that validation through non-material means"" to ""totally obsessed with sucking material goods and services from a man and showing that off to other people (mostly women).  It was an interesting course and study.",1363793698

Sometimes empathy goes a long way -- instead of thinking ""This guy's being a such dick"", ask yourself ""Why is this guy being such a dick?"". On the other hand, if the tone is a little too belligerent, it's also important to note that some ""customers"" aren't worth having, and you get rid of them.<p>The second is ""I'm doing you a favour, you should appreciate it"". Usually taking this perspective starts with ""if you don't like it, go elsewhere"" and it rarely ends well.<p>I typically try to treat everyone in my dealings (employers, employees I manage, and my peers, etc.) like customers unless they force me to not to, but they always get the benefit of the doubt the first few times around.<p>What I typically find with people who are extremely frustrated who are looking for help is that they become extremely thankful and contrite once you've helped them, especially if you showed them a little empathy in helping them.",1363793681

DARPA has been sponsoring human identification at a distance studies since 2000, which often combines gait analysis with facial and gesture analysis. Its a hot field right now, and has been heralded as a less invasive approach than retina scans or blood tests or fingerprinting.

Fullstop. As in, any process that isn't waterfall, is called ""an Agile process.""<p>You <i>can</i> be ""agile"" by just goofing around with no big plan; if the work gets done, you can look back at the points where you made little plans, and say ""well, see, we were doing Agile.""

I'm saying it in the <i>vacuous</i> sense: that the term ""Agile"" is <i>meaningless</i> other than in that it means ""not waterfall."" Waterfall is doing design once, at the start of the process. If you ever do design again at any point, ever break your design up into pieces and postpone some of them, or design this feature at a separate point than that feature--then you're not doing waterfall. And so, the Agile people will say, you're ""doing Agile."" That's it. That's all they mean. You've designed more than once.<p>And your response should be ""...so what?""<p>(But it should also be, in a more diplomatic sense, ""well, then we're <i>all</i> doing Agile already <i>anyway</i>, aren't we?

-Packing of the wound + local epinephrine administration is currently used. It costs nothing, is well understood, and doesnt have the potential for embolization or immune system interaction weirdness.<p>-Hemostasis of an extremity wound AFTER a tourniquet has been applied.
-After a tourniquet is properly placed, the arterial flow is halted. Trauma teams have learned from military and orthopedic surgeons that tourniquets are much safer than traditionally understood. Even an amputated limb has a warm ischemia team of 6 hours. The addition of a clotting agent would stop venous oozing, but wouldnt affect hemodynamics of the patient. It might assist in the case of an inappropriately applied tourniquet.<p>-Hemostasis of an abdominal wound.
- I guess they envisage pouring this material into the abdomen? That seems like the place most fraught with danger of embolization distally to the mesentery and the generation of immune system interaction weirdness beyond my knowledge base.<p>A kaolin-based product (Quickclot) was similarly marketed as a wonder drug for treating massive hemorrhage on the battlefield, and it has been less than wonderful in practice. There are youtube videos attesting to its efficacy on the femoral arteries of swine, however these videos ignore the effect wind has upon the powder in a combat setting, and the exothermic reaction that takes place to create the plug. The only way to stop a large hemorrhage is to use copious amounts of the material, resulting in severe burns in some case reports. Concern over embolization of the clotted material led them to create a gauze-bag version.<p>The companys claims that holding pressure over the wound is not required runs counter to basic trauma care recommendations. The single best way to halt life-threatening hemorrhage in an extremity is a tourniquet, and the only thing that halts thorax hemorrhage is a surgeons finger. The inclusion of this gel in the treatment algorithm would need to be as a last resort, and must never distract from the basics of direct pressure and rapid transport to a surgeon.<p>I don't know if this qualifies as an ad hominem on my part, but the article comes across as written by the journalist in close coordination with the companies PR firm. The 'hook' inherent in the choice of headline combined with the lack of any discussion of the limitations of the product or previous failures with regards to miracle hemorrhage agents cements this in my opinion.",1363792998

Android is the cross-platform environment that companies like Samsung use as a base for the software that comes preinstalled on their devices.<p>An ""iOS release"" is the time when the ROM that is delivered to the iPhone is finished and has been tested. An ""Android release"" is a milestone when about 70% of Samsung's ROM is finished, and they now start adding customizations, applications, QA etc.<p>New features to the Apple app store and iTunes are part of an iOS version update. The Play store, Google Music, Maps etc are updated multiple times each year, often to devices that are based on an older version of Android.<p>Don't get me wrong: Version legacy is a problem for most Android engineers. It becomes better with every release (2.3 is much more fun to code for that 1.6 was). But of course we would all like to work for the latest version as soon as it is released.<p>But on the other hand: At least we <i></i>do<i></i> have a cross platform technology like Android now. There used to be 100s of devices before Android was around, and companies like Apple still do this ""make a new app just for our phone"" thing. I'm very glad that today I can write a single application for HTC sense and Samsung TouchWiz. It's not a 100% perfect cross platform environment,  and somestimes I still have to write some extra code for each devices.<p>But a 90% cross platform technology with legacy problems is still much better than not having a cross platform technology in the first place.<p>As for the consumer point of view: ""Android"" is not what he is buying. If a device gets updates or does not depend on the software, but on the service provider who is responsible for the software on your phone. That is usually the company that you bought the phone from.<p>Samsung's top phones get an OS update about once per year, just like Apple does it. For about two years after it was released, which is worse than Apple, but not aweful.<p>Some vendors are better (Google, Asus), some are worse (LG, Motorola). But that is not a software issue. It's just a misunderstanding that companies and press are not good at explaining to consumers: That Android is not an alternative to the iPhone. Galaxy S, HTC One and Nexus are, and you don't get the same software and service if you buy any of these.",1363792759

5407670,comment,5404986,5406963,2,0,madaxe,,,"Yeah, as I said, long story. It's true that the debt isn't legally transferrable, but I was left in a situation where I had no choice but to take it on.<p>Long and the short - kid brother at expensive private boarding school - taking him out wasn't an option, as at the time I was about to go to university, and having a dependent child in my student halls was a non-starter. Therefore, had to keep him at the school - managed to get a bursary (reduction in fees) and amenable credit terms from them, and this little side of things racked up some 60k of debt over the four years I paid for. I also ended up paying for my last two years, as it turned out my parents hadn't, and the school (same school!) kindly decided to sic the bailiffs on <i>me</i> for that, as I was their only traceable contact. In the interests of not having my bro expelled for my delinquency, I stumped up the cash. So far, so good, 80k in the hole.<p>Some years before this shit all went down, my dad bought a house from my great aunt at a below-market price, which was above the ludicrously below-market price offer they were about to accept from equity-release pirates, so they could continue living there. He dropped this like a hot rock, failed to pay the mortgage, and that entire side of my family came crashing down on me with their ire for not stepping up to the plate to help said elderly great aunt. Sucker here offered to buy the house out from his dad, on the proviso that said aunt would pay a peppercorn rent to help me cover the mortgage, and the ensuing scenario was that I got gouged by my old man to the tune of 3x what he paid for the place not 4 years previously (asshole kicked off a bidding war with a property developer for me, kindly), and the great aunt reneged on her agreement to pay rent, leaving me with a 100k property I didn't want and a nice cash drain in the form of property taxes, maintenance, and all the rest... oh, and a sitting tenant. Who's still there, and still tells her kith and kin that she owns the place. Waiting the old bird out at this point, but at least I've paid off the mortgage these days.<p>Next up came supporting my mother, who after vanishing for six months resurfaced needing cash in order to not lose her house. Idiot here paid for the remainder of the mortgage on her house, by extending the mortgage on the above house, giving her somewhere to live.<p>At this point, I'm 18, at university, 200k in the hole, and everything's peachy. Add student debt to that, and by the time I graduated, I had about 250k of debt to my name, not counting all the other shit that my parents dropped which the debt collectors had started chasing me for.<p>Started the company at 22, while still heavily in debt, but at least making some headway, and ""only"" about 200k in the hole. Spent another 18 months dodging bailiffs after my parents until I could start going ""Statute of limitations"" and hanging up on them, and, as of last year, I finally have a net worth > 0.<p>So, yeah, there's the dismal ditty, which I largely brought upon myself, but, as they say, every cloud has a silver lining, and I got two major positives out of the whole experience:<p>1) The expectation that everyone is out to screw me, and that everyone will renege on every promise they will ever make to you. This leads to one being rather cautious with client and contract dealings, and has saved our bacon more than a few times.<p>2) Having nothing to lose is one hell of an incentive to take insane risks, like ditching a well-paying job to move into a office-cum-home squat to start a business.",1363791942

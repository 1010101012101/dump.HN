As you note, in the month of Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to dusk. Right before dawn, they eat <i>seheri</i>, and after dusk, they eat <i>iftaar</i>. During the month of Ramadan, no one seems to lose any weight, mainly because everyone seems to overcompensate during iftaar. Where I come from iftaar food is much oilier and richer than the food people usually eat, and also people tend to eat much more during iftaar than they would otherwise. My friends all regularly report gaining weight at the end of Ramadan.

8832114,comment,8826762,8826762,0,0,richmarr,,,"Great post. I was part of a team that built a commercial image comparison engine, and worked on a lot of this stuff directly. Feeling all nostalgic now.<p>Some of the issues that anyone attempting similar will bump into are:<p>(1) If you&#x27;re looking at shape features, a heavy dependency on product positioning. We found you need to do classification and use secondary features to get around this.<p>(2) Avoiding matching on background colours. For flat-background images you can sample the corners. For gradient backgrounds you can need some kind of edge detection.<p>(3) Shadow removal. A lot of the colours extracted from images are shadows of the actual perceived colour. You can generally pick the perceived colour by clustering the relevant pixels by hue/saturation and picking the middle of the lightness curve bit it varies by material.<p>(4) Data. Fashion retail products are numerous and go out of stock very quickly so to get any real value out of this specific example you need a nice efficient data pipeline and capacity to handle constant change<p>(5) Query performance / index size. We used an inverted index based on Lucene to query the data. To get decent relevance you need to include more visual words than you&#x27;d typically use in a text query. In our setup we found 25-30 visual words per feature was about right. This meant you needed to keep the index size under a million records, which meant we needed a distributed index. MLT queries are useful here, but last time I looked, which was admittedly a long time ago, Lucene had an annoying performance problem that I had to work around (<a href=""https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1690"" rel=""nofollow"">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1690</a>)<p>(6) Value prop. Make sure you&#x27;re optimising for the right use case, because as other commenters have pointed out, the relevance of this kind of system needs to be tuned to what you want to accomplish with it and the kind of data you&#x27;ll be processing.<p>Nobody should let themselves be put off by that list though.

My understanding is that an aircraft can also have an ADS-B receiver onboard, which allows the pilot to identify other traffic in the local area - it doesn&#x27;t rebroadcast the signals as in a mesh network (I don&#x27;t think there is any encryption in these signals either, so that&#x27;s probably a good thing).<p>ADS-B is only really used currently as a secondary resource for identifying aircraft rather than seeing where aircraft are. The primary way is by using a radar return, and matching this up with the aircraft transponder which reports the aircraft ID and altitude.<p>At the moment I don&#x27;t think there are any hard requirements on having ADS-B transmission equipment on aircraft, although most commercial airliners already have it (which is what FlightAware and such usually use - at least outside the US).

print(&quot;x is: &quot; + str(x)).
That&#x27;s already too much to keep typing, but sometimes I&#x27;ll want to know the type, or maybe it&#x27;s a dictionary and printing without separators makes them blend together (say, in a for loop). In that case, I&#x27;ll do:

The answer you want requires pages of response, because you haven&#x27;t even given me a scaffold upon which to start. Do you want to start with the start of education policies in the US? The post-war baby boom changes like &quot;New Math&quot; and &quot;Back to Basics&quot;? We have a federal system, so there are over 50 different systems (including territories), to say nothing of local school boards.<p>There&#x27;s the increasing desire to run schools as a business, rather than as a public good. There&#x27;s the increasing push for removing union protections. I think it&#x27;s funded partially by a way for for-profit companies to make money off of all of the education dollars, hid behind the religion of free market.<p>That said, none of these are new factors. It&#x27;s all a difference in weighting factors over the last century or two. One of those reweightings is Bill Gates, whose foundations funded nearly $250 million towards Common Core.

All other things being equal, to the the extent that you can experimentally make all the other things equal in this case, would I have a higher overall white blood cell count after fasting than I had before fasting? Does fasting (starving?) weaken my immune system initially? To what extent? Is that extent recovered, and exceeded, by the new WBC production that wouldn&#x27;t have been triggered otherwise? I&#x27;m comparing this, admittedly based on zero evidence, with the flight response. Adrenaline makes me run faster, but it doesn&#x27;t make me a faster runner.

I think you're just redefining execution and idea to blur the line so that what is the result of a good idea is now under the category of execution.<p>Why the hell are people still arguing this point.<p>In my mind the argument of ""execution"" vs. ""good idea"" is like arguing whether food or water or air or sleep is more important.<p>You need all.  Case closed.<p>I think as people who ""execute"" programmers tend to have (from what I've seen over a year) a knee-jerk ""execution is everything"" reaction out of some deep insecurity or something.<p>The very existence of this ""I can't think of any good ideas"" is testament to the notion that execution is not the be-all end-all.<p>If I can never find a programming partner, worse case scenario I can still use my contacts to raise capital and then hire programmers, though my negotiating leverage in raising capital would be a lot less than if I had a partner who can help put together the idea.<p>What is this programmer going to do without a good idea that people want and a good idea how to make money off of it?<p>Start programming randomly until he accidently codes a useful service people pay for?<p><i>""O----kay""</i>",1204477097

127415,comment,127322,127402,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Who said that TED was selecting people primarily for ""quality""? (If they say so, which I'm not sure they do, it's purely sales pitch.)<p>It's obvious to me that TED is, by design or by accident, an invite-only conference for people who tend to be rich. The fact that it's famous is just a side effect of that: if you invite <i>one</i> celebrity to a meeting, you'll get some press coverage; if you invite several hundred celebrities you'll get a <i>slew</i> of press coverage.<p>The fact that TED is full of smart people giving smart talks is also a side effect of the guest list: smart people are drawn to present at TED for the same reason that Willie Sutton was drawn to rob banks: that's where the money is. Convincing, say, Bill Gates that your work is interesting is a pretty darned good way to advance your work, especially if the press is there, and even if he doesn't pay you a massive fee for the speech -- which, for all I know, TED does.<p>(I don't mean to imply that rich people are nothing but walking piles of money -- although, if they were, many of us would still gladly talk to them. Many people are rich for a reason! Bill Gates is nobody's fool. Rumor has it that Larry and Sergey are kind of smart. And other people make use of their wealth to become very expert in one thing or another: money buys a lot of education and research. Al Gore didn't rise through the ranks of the climate scientists, but he's talked to one hell of a lot of them.)<p>If you want to talk to poor, misunderstood, trained ""thinkers of tomorrow"" with interesting ideas, go to any local university and you'll find several hundred. I should know. Shouldn't we hold conferences for these poor, misunderstood thinkers? We do! There's <i>thousands</i> of academic conferences every year. There are three going on right now in your town. You just don't know about them, because the cameras are pointing at TED.<p>I don't think it's a crime for rich people to hold a private invite-only meeting. (Whether or not they should be allowed to make binding, enforceable political decisions about my life in such a meeting is a completely different question.) I'm glad that, at this particular rich-person's meeting, they decide to invite scientists and technologists and great artists, instead of concentrating entirely on polo ponies and booze. And I'm glad that they film a lot of the meeting and release those films for free.",1204475274

127403,comment,127343,127343,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Both.  App is divided into components - the editor is one component, which is written as a JavaScript application that's kicked off with a single JS function call and handles all the HTML for itself, dynamically.  The rest of the website is generated on the server and uses JS only for decoration.<p>I'd worry more about ease of programming than machine constraints.  Webapps are rarely CPU-bound, so the overhead of template instantiation isn't likely to make much difference.  You definitely want to keep related functionality together - in earlier drafts, I'd generated the HTML for the editor on the server and manipulated it with JQuery.  This was a disaster - I could never remember whether functionality was in the HTML template or in the JavaScript, and I had to duplicate some logic in both places.",1204473743
127402,comment,127322,127372,0,0,ldambra,,,"Sure, but the money criteria is not relevant when you want to select people for their quality. The people that history remembers over centuries are more than often people that were not very wealthy during their lives because they were too much ahead of their times and as such : misunderstood.<p>But I agree the journalist's rant is poor because it doesn't ask the good questions. An invite-only conference is not a problematic concept. Having money as a criteria is, because it conveys the idea that intesteresting people and ""thinkers of tommorow"" are necessarily wealthy. History makes this assumption very  questionable.",1204473743

Because I&#x27;d sure like to be able to run my Xfce desktop with D-Bus off in FreeBSD.<p>&quot;D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to one another.&quot;<p>With shared memory (IPC) or sockets (RPC), applications can talk to each other.<p>Yes, D-Bus gives you an API interface for this (though I personally can&#x27;t stand it); which apparently comes with tremendous overhead, if the linked article is to be believed.<p>Yes, with raw memory/sockets, you have to do the queue work yourself. But that&#x27;s CS101 stuff; you shouldn&#x27;t touch IPC if you can&#x27;t implement a simple shared queue.<p>For most use cases, D-Bus is like using a jackhammer to nail in drywall.<p>&quot;In addition to interprocess communication ... it makes it simple and reliable to code a &quot;single instance&quot; application or daemon&quot;<p>Again, very easy with shared memory and a semaphore. If your attempt to open the semaphore fails, you create it and become the daemon. When the daemon closes, you delete the semaphore. When a second instance opens and connects to the semaphonre, and then shared memory, then it writes the command-line arguments into the queue, and the daemon handles it. Voila, &quot;single instance&quot; application or daemon.<p>&quot;and to launch applications and daemons on demand when their services are needed&quot;<p>And this would be a more complex use case that would be harder to solve. It&#x27;s also a much less common use case. I don&#x27;t really feel it&#x27;s directly related to basic IPC, it&#x27;s D-Bus trying to solve multiple problems at the same time.<p>I&#x27;d rather follow the Unix way and split that into a separate component, perhaps built on top of the IPC protocol.",1430221952

9451531,comment,9450781,9450898,0,0,thunderbong,,,"There&#x27;s a very important reason as to why that gap exists. And it has to do with usability.<p>Earlier, when tabbed browsing happened, all the browsers, which in those days was Opera and Firefox, did NOT have the tabs right till the top. The title bar would still show which in turn would give you a gap above the tabs to move the whole browser window.<p>So, when you&#x27;re browsing full screen and you use your mouse to drag the whole window you&#x27;ll click on the top bar and move it away (which in turn would restore the window to the non-maximized size).<p>Then Google Chrome appeared and started using the title bar to put tabs into. I think this also had to do with Windows 7 allowing this. (I don&#x27;t think this was possible in Windows XP).<p>Other browsers, including Opera followed. However, Opera kept usability in mind and put a 1px gap between the top edge and from where the tabs begin. So, even in full screen mode you can control the whole window using the mouse.<p>How did Chrome solve this problem? Their tabs were tapered, so that you&#x27;d get a gap in between to tabs to control the window. In the case of Firefox, the tabs had more rounded corners to achieve the same thing. However, Opera tabs had always been the squarest, so they decided to leave the 1px gap.<p>In any other browser, which allows tabs in the title bar, when in full screen mode, try to control the window by clicking the top of any tab and you&#x27;ll see that it cannot work. You&#x27;ll only end up holding the tab and the browser window will think you&#x27;re trying to detach it.<p>Hope this helps.",1430221685

Having formerly programmed casino games I&#x27;ve seen this bug many times before:<p><pre><code>    To me this doesn&#x27;t look like some &quot;glitch&quot; in the machine but rather an\n    oversight by Aristocrat&#x27;s programmers. Most casino games have a bonus\n    round obtained from the right combination of symbols. So at the end of\n    the bonus round the player will receive a &quot;Regular Win&quot; and a &quot;Bonus\n    Win&quot;. Sometimes the regular win is subtracted or not counted in the\n    bonus win, sometimes it is counted. Can&#x27;t remember what Miss Kitty&#x27;s\n    rules are exactly but let&#x27;s say that in this case the regular win is\n    subtracted from the Bonus win. So the programmer will subtract =>\n    bonusWin - regularWIn = totalWin\n\n    Ok, now lets assume that granny\n    had a really terrible bonus round, like she only won $5 when she had a\n    regular win of $10. Ok, so the grand total will be $5.00 - $10.00 =\n    -$5.00.\n\n    But why didn&#x27;t the &quot;Total Win&quot; display a negative\n    number? Well, it&#x27;s simply because many casino game developers use\n    Unsigned 32 bit integers in win amounts. Basically unsigned integers\n    cannot have negative numbers. So when you subtract one larger unsigned\n    integer from a smaller one instead of resulting in a negative number the\n    result will wrap around to its largest possible value. In the case of\n    unsigned Integers that&#x27;s => 4,294,967,295 with two decimal places\n    added it for the cent amounts it comes to $42,949,672.94!\n\n    That\n    still doesn&#x27;t explain exactly why the win was a bit below $42 million.\n    My guess is that its smaller because of the programming language used\n    and the processor word size. Max integer size varies from language to\n    language but it for an unsigned 32bit integer its usually around that\n    value.&quot;</code></pre>",1430220328

41744,comment,41709,41724,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I suspect we're seeing a classic disruptive innovation at work here.  A new technology (blogging) arrives that provides <i>lower</i> quality than existing markets demand, but does so at dramatically reduced cost.  Existing solutions have overshot the quality levels demanded by the marketplace - the average American can't tell the difference between FOX News and the New York Times.  The existing market remains, but is dwarfed in size by the new market for low-quality, shoot-from-the-hit journalism.  Meanwhile, incumbents find they can't meet the cost structures necessary to compete in the new market.<p>I suspect that the New York Times will go the way of the Betamax and the Lisp Machine.  It becomes a quaint relic of a technically superior age, but nobody actually buys it anymore.<p>The good news is that once a disruptive innovation has taken over the market, it usually improves to eventually match the original incumbent.  So after a few years of drek, we'll see the worst, most content-free blogs die off and be replaced by people who put more thought into it.  I suspect this is what'll happen to the best reporters - after a few lean years, they'll start up blogs, people will realize that those blogs give much better information than the competition, and they'll end up making much more than they ever did while working for a newspaper.  After all, they don't have to share all the ad revenue they generate with the print staff anymore.<p>Only the best reporters, though.  It'll suck to be a mediocre reporter, just as it sucks to be a mediocre real estate agent now and it sucked to be a mediocre programmer in 2002.  The field will probably shrink significantly, but that's the whole point of capitalism - freeing up labor to work in fields where they'll be more productive.",1186959264

41737,comment,41716,41716,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"The bottom line is that social networks are mostly a waste of time. Geek and Social do not really go together. You usually have a small and close group of friends and you sure do not need FB or MSp to connect with them. I have a FB profile and that is because I have a Facebook application and my only friends are a few users and my co-foundrs. 
But remember that just because you are not using Facebook does not mean you should not look for opportunities in the environment. If you can build an app that will generate a nice return within a few months, then do it. ",1186958740

Of course plans from successful companies are preferable, but success can also be related to a tighter corporate hold on plans.<p>Some starting points:

Having hundreds of ""friends"" is pointless (how many of them actually know you well? less than 10?) and it's a lot easier to maintain relationship with those you care about through personal correspondence through email or over the phone or in person.<p>Facebook is just a giant game designed for you to waste a lot of your time on it. I'd rater work on something productive... but hey, do whatever rocks your boat.

41724,comment,41709,41709,0,0,far33d,,,"This is damning analysis, and, I think, too conservative - I think the real picture is worse for the NYT. <p>But, what should we, as a society, do about it? While blogs and other citizen journalism have actually helped journalism, there is still significant value in dedicated professional journalism. A significant amount of the raw material that is discussed in the political and news blogs comes from the professional sites. <p>Reporting is expensive and good reporting is hard - we'll be at a serious loss if someone doesn't figure out a good way to pay for it.

41719,comment,41699,41699,0,0,Goladus,,,"I would suggest rather than trying to find what you love, try first to learn to love what you do.  Almost everyone has room to do their job better.  The direction you should take your career will become more obvious after you do that.  In my experience, these are the biggest obstacles to loving what you do:<p>- Being pessimistic yourself.<p>- Being surrounded by pessimistic people.<p>- Working for pessimistic management.<p>- Dealing with a poor physical work environment.<p>- Forgetting to aggressively attempt hard problems.<p>Sometimes, you'll hit a wall.  It can't ALL come from within (though some Bhuddists may disagree).  <p>I unloaded trucks in a warehouse for a few months after college, and while it was rewarding to get stronger and satisfying to work very quickly, it was clear that there would be very little change approaching infinity, and I could not do this the rest of my life.  <p>In my last job, I was beginning to notice a similar wall, but more importantly it was fairly clear that management both did not enjoy working with technology, and did not enjoy managing employees within the framework of the company.  They did not enjoy dealing with bureaucracy, yet it was forced on them often.  This resulted in consistently poor morale.  Even when we thought morale was good, it was bad by the standards of the company I work fow now.  <p>It happened so gradually that all of a sudden one day I noticed that the thought of going to work made me sick to me stomach.  But I knew it wasn't the work, because just a month or so earlier I'd happily immersed myself in a project and learned a lot, and I'd been making consistent progress.  <p>If you need inspiration, Paul Graham's essays are good, although the one I would recommend first is Fred Brooks ""The Tar Pit"" (part of <i>The Mythical Man-Month</i> collection).  In particular, in the section called ""Joys of the Craft"" he lists five reasons:  The joy of making things, the pleasure of making them for other people, the fascination of the puzzle-like nature of the problems, the joy of always learning, and the delight of working in such a ""tractible medium"" that nevertheless produces real measurable results.

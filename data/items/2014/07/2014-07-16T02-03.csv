Then only those regions need to be checked for memory safety vulnerabilities rather than the whole codebase.<p>Although, many things can be written in safe code and still be performant: iterators provide safe and highly efficient sequential access to vectors and arrays (right now they optimise to the same code as the equivalent C/C++, other a bug in LLVM where it&#x27;s not recognising that some pointers are guaranteed to be nonnull).",1405478893

You can drop down to C level by writing code in unsafe blocks and using methods prefixed with &quot;unsafe.&quot; This will stop the compiler from doing things like inserting bounds checking and should perform fairly close to Clang.<p>Generally though, rust strives for the same ideal as C++: you only get what you pay for.

I haven&#x27;t mentioned the word &#x27;dictionary&#x27; at all, with the exception of one quote from your own source. You&#x27;re attributing to me an argument that I&#x27;m not making - I couldn&#x27;t care less whether you call an encyclopaedia a &#x27;dictionary&#x27;, an &#x27;encyclopaedia&#x27;, or a &#x27;sauerkraut sandwich&#x27; here. I haven&#x27;t said anywhere &quot;That should be in a dictionary&quot;<p>I&#x27;m talking about the <i>function</i> of an encyclopaedia - which your own link has sources generally requiring non-brief articles. Articles which discuss and expand on a subject. Even the etymology provided is &#x27;general education&#x27;, which implies more than mere definition of a word.<p>Yes, super-short articles like &#x27;gumboil&#x27; or &#x27;Gimle&#x27; should be rolled into larger, more comprehensive articles. There is plenty you could add to gumboil - an image to show one, demographic preponderances, common treatments, common complicating factors, all of which enhance the user&#x27;s knowledge of the topic. It <i>certainly</i> should be reduced or modified in terms of jargon. As for Gimlé, there&#x27;s no reason why it can&#x27;t be rolled into a more comprehensive article on Asgard, Norse Mythology, or whatever. Check out the &#x27;Elysium&#x27; article for ways you can expand it to make it a more useful article in its own right.<p>Another thing that you&#x27;re missing is that WP (and myself) both view these things as undesirable, but not so undesirable that they should be destroyed as a matter of course. They&#x27;re just bad articles - and contrary to what you&#x27;re saying, they&#x27;re far from complete.<p>In the case of the &#x27;grasses&#x27; links of the OP, these are absolutely terrible articles (the irony being that they&#x27;re chaff - an appropriately grassy reference). Yes, it&#x27;s information, but it&#x27;s very poorly laid out and hard to access or compare. It&#x27;s the absolute barest information - and far, <i>far</i> from &quot;general education&quot; substansiveness. Cool, Brachiaria plantaginea is a grass, but let&#x27;s have a look at the entry:<p><i>Brachiaria plantaginea [1] is a species of grass which was first described by Heinrich Friedrich Link, and got its current name of Albert Spear Hitchcock. Brachiaria plantaginea included in the genus Brachiaria, and the grass family. [2] [3] No subspecies are listed in the Catalogue of Life.</i> (ta, google translate)<p>There is barely any information here beyond &quot;It&#x27;s a grass&quot;. What kind of grass? Is it grass like crabgrass? Like asparagus? Like bamboo? What are it&#x27;s characteristics? Where do you find it? Is it peculiar to any animal&#x27;s diets? How does it propagate? What does it even look like? Does it have defense mechanisms? Does it survive arid climates well? Are humans allergic to it at all? Not to mention that it&#x27;s self-evident in the name <i>Brachiaria plantaginea</i> that it&#x27;s in the genus Brachiaria.<p>It&#x27;s an awful, very low quality article - regardless of whether or not you think such <i>information</i> belongs in an encyclopaedia, the <i>article quality</i> does not. Do you feel generally educated by that article? Do you feel like the thing that is <i>Brachiaria plantaginea</i> has been sufficiently discussed? Is the article self-contained (ha!) and explained in detail? These three questions are fundamental parts of the definitions of &#x27;encyclopaedia&#x27; given by your original link (and which I don&#x27;t particularly contest - I rather agree with them).",1405478777

This is because there&#x27;s not a whole lot to interact with in space, but there&#x27;s tons of matter once you start hitting the atmosphere. At ultra high energies, cosmic rays cause extensive air showers leading to radiation in the form of gamma rays, muons, and electrons/positrons through pair production. The electrons are actually called the &quot;electronic shower&quot; There is a distance where the average energy of the photons in the shower is less than 1MeV, causing pair production to cease. This distance into the atmosphere is called Xmax, but it&#x27;s dependent upon the amount of mass in the atmosphere, not the magnetic field. For lower energy cosmic rays, Xmax is pretty small.

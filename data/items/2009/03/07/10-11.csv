506430,comment,506300,506300,0,0,tdoggette,,,"Frankly, I don't think cloud computing is the Next Big Thing people make it out to be. It's just another case of something the geeks have had for years (file servers, easy remote access to everything) being adapted to the mainstream. Sure, it's better for many, and the benefits to web and app hosting are significant, but ""cloud computing"" means roughly ""on a server somewhere else.""",1236423240

When I get awe-struck comments from those looking over my shoulder, it's not about any plugins or IDE-like functionality, it's about how fast I'm editing text. Let's remind ourselves, that's the core function of a text editor: to help you edit text, as quickly and unobtrusively as possible.<p>I was hoping to see more of that angle in this video, but instead I just saw how emacs can be an IDE. I'd be very interested to just see a couple of classes (or any substantial chunk of code) written by an emacs ""power user"" without the narration and tutorial.",1236422227
506424,comment,504151,505457,0,0,newt0311,,,"In my case, I am actually much more interested in econ. and business. CS is just something I do as well, thus my interest in banking regulation, accounting, and valuations techniques (though I am, by no means, an expert on any of those subjects...).<p>As it so happens, CS people are much better at computers than economists etc... though there are some excellent econ. blogs on the internet which I enjoy reading.<p>Its a matter of specialization. I just happen to have banks as on of the things I try to specialize in.",1236422184

I basically like the concept of speedbar but it's just pretty unidiomatic for Emacs in its inefficiency with usage both with a mouse or the keyboard (via C-x 5 o).<p>It's zillion times more effective to navigate using find-file or just by jumping to an existing buffer.",1236421776

506418,comment,505938,506030,0,0,nostrademons,,,"How about computers, then?  Working as a software engineering employee or contractor is not a scalable profession: you get paid for your time, and your time is limited.  However, working as a micro-ISV or startup founder <i>is</i> scalable: you get paid for selling a product, and it costs you nothing to produce additional copies of that product.<p>I think the grandparent's point is that some careers have multiple business models, some of which are scalable and some of which are not.  So scalability is not a property of the career, but rather of a particular revenue stream.  Heck, many firms do both, like his example of a rock band, or like the software company that both sells a product and then makes money supporting that product (eg. RedHat, 37signals, and Fog Creek).",1236420554

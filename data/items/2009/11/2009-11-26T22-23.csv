963192,comment,963192,963134,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"This is not philosophy at all. This is purely technical.  The differences between AAVE and standard English (or should I say American?) are <i>consistent</i>. They are spoken by a lot of people. They follow precise rules (a grammar, actually). They're not erratic. So you can't call them ""errors"". The only other choice is to conclude that AAVE is a language —or a dialect.<p>Telling that to kids can only have good effects.  First, it is telling them that they're not retarded —and neither are their parents.  Second, it makes a clear separation between AAVE an standard English. They are two separate dialects, so, students should learn both.  Third, if speaking standard English is ""correcting errors"", it may be percieved as a loss of Identity, ""acting white"" or whatever. If it is ""speaking another language"", this can't really be seen as such. For instance, I don't lose my French identity by writing English.<p>If the entire world sees AAVE as incorrectly spoken English without investigating furter, the entire world is simply mistaken.  Kids should learn to <i>correct</i> the entire world's mistakes, not to <i>do</i> them.",1259274639

There are problems analogous to studying a species with only the last two individuals from which to draw data.  I think there is some mechanism here that links the softer fields inextricably with politics.  There is less academic ""territory"" to occupy, and so there is a handicap to the political power of academics who study that particular data, while at the same time, there's also often increased power that stems from scarcity.

An entire web of ""ethics"" rules and well-funded politicians presents a formidable barrier to change.  For true blood-boiling outrage, read the very sharp analysis of how the industry is rigged in this report submitted to the FTC a few years ago: <a href=""http://www.savvybroker.com/Nine-Pillars-Citadel-aRealEstateCart.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.savvybroker.com/Nine-Pillars-Citadel-aRealEstateC...</a><p>As technologists, try reading each of the points in this report as network partitions, and design a solution to route around the information block.  There are various approaches available now to bypass some of these rules.<p>Alas, they can rewrite the rules, too, as necessary.  For example, in Texas realtors were taking bulk listings from builders and investors for a flat fee of $150 and putting the data in the MLS, but nothing else.  Since this was a direct attack on the semi-fixed price of 6% commissions, the Texas Association of Realtors got their politician lackeys to pass a new law, requiring ""minimum professional services"" from all Texas real estate license holders.  This fixed price posting still goes on a bit, but not in bulk anymore.  Any technical routing around of the MLS must expect the Borg to counterattack.<p>The realtor associations even violate their own rules, and/or keep their rules vague, so when the time comes they slap everyone around by giving them days to comply or they are cut off from MLS. (That cuts off an entire brokerage when one agent is out of compliance.)  With that kind of career-ending leverage, they are quite effective in keeping the sharecroppers down on the farm, and paid up on their dues.<p>I have never been a realtor, but I did follow a carefully laid out plan to be licensed and still avoid the Borg, which the realtor association ignored completely.

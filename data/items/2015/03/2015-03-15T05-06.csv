9205525,comment,9205177,9205177,0,0,adrusi,,,"I&#x27;m a CS freshman at UMD who&#x27;s been getting into the hackathon scene in the past months (been to 3, am somewhat involved with the HH facebook groups). I&#x27;ve been involved with the software community for about 5 years though, and programmed for 7.<p>> It bothers me to see how obsessed with success this generation of &quot;hackers&quot; seems to be.<p>Yeah, there&#x27;s a lot of people who want to get rich by making a startup, and recently there was a poll that showed that the majority of people in the Facebook group want to go into management in their mid to late career. We&#x27;re in the middle of a tech bubble and I think this is a symptom of it. Over the past decade or two, working with computers has become &quot;cooler&quot; as a part of &quot;geek culture&quot;. People have seen a lot of people get outrageously rich with tech startups. And people are realizing that software is a high-paying field with a lower barrier to entry than most similar occupations. It&#x27;s attracted a lot of people who just want money where previously there were people who were truly passionate. Or maybe it was always like that, I can&#x27;t know.<p>> I have met people who were justifying censorship, population control and unfair business practices because they could benefit from them someday. I was expecting a little more regard to civil liberties and ethics from students and so called &quot;hackers&quot;.<p>I haven&#x27;t noticed that there&#x27;s more people with this attitude within the hackathon community than outside it. Maybe a bit of unfair business practices, but the cases I saw seemed to be the result of not realizing that a practice was unfair. (Not counting the joke ideas that get thrown around all the time of course)<p>> People win by making &quot;cool&quot; apps (Uber for X) whereas technical hacks are totally ignored<p>It&#x27;s a sad truth that simple CRUD apps are over-rewarded at hackathons. Interesting technical hacks aren&#x27;t &quot;totally ignored&quot; though. It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s harder to judge how long it will take to make something interesting, so either the result ends up being unfinished, or too unambitious, and it fails to capture the attention of judges.<p>It&#x27;s also important to note that making a CRUD app that doesn&#x27;t need to scale is easier than making an actually interesting piece of software. Some people aren&#x27;t/think they aren&#x27;t skilled enough to make anything else (yet).<p>> &quot;There is such ignorance in this world about who we are. We are not criminals. We are innovators. We create things. We change the world.[...]&quot;<p>While this does display narcissism, I think you&#x27;re misinterpreting &quot;we are not criminals&quot;. I think in context this person is saying that &quot;hacking&quot; in the context of hackathons is not what movie hackers do, breaking into networks and stealing sensitive information.<p>> Students who believe to be 1000x SE because they can stick two APIs together and use bootstrap end-up to be very condescending older engineers.<p>Yeah, this is a thing. I think it&#x27;s a part of getting good at something for some people. I was certainly like this at around age 14 when I started being able to make software that could be useful. Suddenly I thought I was some sort of genius and looked down upon a lot of other people. I grew out of it, partly by not being 14 anymore, and partly by being exposed to the wealth of things I didn&#x27;t know about.<p>> Hackathons are great to try out new technologies, meet new people and outreach to demographics that are traditionally under-represented in CS but I don&#x27;t like where this is headed.<p>Show up to hackathons, make something technically interesting, and tell other people about it. People <i>are</i> intrigued by those willing to step outside the normal realm of hackathon projects. I do this. I have some friends who do this. If enough people go in with this attitude, eventually the culture will change.<p>> Like HS there is &quot;cool kids&quot; who are &quot;Student Entrepreneur&quot; or &quot;Innovator, UX Artist blah blah&quot;, &quot;RoR Genius&quot; etc... and the rest of the world.<p>There&#x27;s not many people who behave like this, but the people who do are pretty obnoxious. There <i>are</i> a lot of people who associate with them but are actually pretty down-to-earth and cool.",1426398735

The children that did chores at 3-4 may have grown up to have good relationships due to other factors in the family that also caused chores.<p>Then the Weissbourd study says nothing about chores.

Had built some cool projects on his flashy portfolio. Went to the same university we want to, which is a top university in the world. Had good grades at said University. etc.<p>He had all the markings of being a fantastic intern for us.<p>About half way through his internship we had to fire him. He lacked the attention span for a long term, rigorous software development project. We later hired someone whom we evaluated very differently and it has been incredible. He&#x27;s doing a fantastic job. Constantly questions our opinions about software and pushes the boundaries of our depth of understanding.<p>To add to this, we knew the fired intern went on to another startup to keep doing whatever it is he thinks he&#x27;s doing. The founders of that company ended up telling us the same exact problems were happening with them. Don&#x27;t worry about these &quot;hackers&quot; and what they&#x27;re doing.

9205515,comment,9205003,9205395,0,0,jdlshore,,,"It&#x27;s not necessarily that simple, but it <i>is</i> simple. You need to do two things:<p>1) Integrate the master branch (or whatever your guaranteed-good branch is) with the code you&#x27;re about to push. This prevents integration conflicts from causing the build to fail.<p>2) Test it on a reference machine. This prevents environment assumptions from causing the build to fail. (Such as installing new software or setting an environment variable, but forgetting to make it part of the build.)<p>These are both easy to do. My preference is to push to a testing branch on the integration machine, merge in the master branch, run the tests, then merge the testing branch back into the master branch. (There&#x27;s a bit more to it than that, to cover edge cases, but that&#x27;s the gist.)<p>Sadly, most teams and CI tools aren&#x27;t set up to do this--although, as the article says, it&#x27;s not rocket science.

Nothing magical, and all common sense, just try to limit your exposure. Here is a quick list:<p><pre><code>  - VPN (no split tunnel)
  - 2FA
  - loner laptop pool (with base OS and their presentation)
    - do not take sensitive data off-site
    - encrypted hard disk
    - antivirus
    - screen locks after X minutes
  - let office know if something happens (lock out accounts)
</code></pre>
Operate from the standpoint that this is going to happen. Work to limit your exposure.

If I were to take a copy of his software, modify it, build a binary from the modified copy, and use that in my proprietary product without making the modified source available to the users of my product, he would believe that I have limited the freedom of the users of my product. If I were to use a code signing scheme in the firmware of my product to block software updates that are not signed by me, he would consider that as limiting the freedom of my users. If I make my users sign a legally binding agreement to not reverse engineer the code before I allow them to buy the product, he would consider that as limiting the freedom of my users.<p>He doesn&#x27;t want me to be able to do any of that that, and so he uses GPLv3, which is only effective because of copyright.

9205484,comment,9178765,9204752,0,0,BrendanEich,,,"tl;dr -- you took too many words spelling out what I already said: that Dart diverged too much and can only hope to rendezvous with ES2030.<p>First, it can&#x27;t without careful separation of its incompatible breaks with JS, from whatever optional type system is standardizable in future JS. The two are intertwined in Dart right now. JS is not going to break compat or add opt-in version selection to runtime-incompatible modes. That died with ES4, buried by 1JS.<p>Second, 2030 or even 2020 is way too far out, given the interest in TC39 right now from Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and other members. And because it took the long-odds bet, Dart is now clearly less likely than TypeScript => StrongScript to have any say on future JS optional types (AKA the revenge of ES4). You write<p>&quot;I also think it gives a lot of real world usage data helpful for getting optional types into ES. (You seem to disagree here.)&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not disagreeing just as a speculative opinion about 2020. I&#x27;m telling you that Dart has missed the optional types boat now, in TC39 -- the next meeting in less than two weeks. Dart and any real-world usage data from it are nowhere, while StrongScript is &quot;on&quot; and should generate V8-based data this year.<p>On the laundry list of &quot;optional types / completion / doc popups...&quot;: most of this has been done without Dart in full or even Dart&#x27;s optional types, including in the Closure compiler. (See DoctorJS for early higher-order control flow analysis that could do completion without making programmers declare types all over.)<p>Even the claim that a new VM is needed to do the complete laundry list is suspect at this point. Yeah, it&#x27;s nice to have a clean slate, or one starting from StrongTalk&#x27;s slate, as Dart did. But if only Google can afford it, it diverges incompatibly up front, and it can only partially re-converge far in the future, then it is very likely a &quot;miss&quot;.<p>Life is not just a series of random Homer Simpson events, with everything about possible futures a matter of opinion. People bet on futures profitably, beating fair coin tosses. Alan Kay was right, the best way to predict is to invent.<p>So the smart money is not on Dart designing future optional types for JS. This could change but I doubt it, since Dart broke too much compatibility, unnecessarily for the purposes of making types optional. No one is disentangling and minimizing a proposal for ES7 or ES8 (2016 or 2017), while StrongScript is in pole position. This is much more like how standards evolution should work than the silly Dash memo&#x27;s model.",1426397160

And the recognition that there are plenty of non-pharmacological situations that render you equally unfit for dealing with certain kinds of emergencies - good luck dealing with a back injury while skiing off-piste.<p>However, throwing out a statement like &quot;drugs make you nonfunctional&quot; does not help the discourse.",1426395632

A VC investing in <i>your business</i> is not hiring you as an employee. If you have an idea you want to implement as a business, <i>that's on you</i>. The VC is offering money in return for equity in hopes of generating capital for the fund's investors. The person managing that investment for the fund is paid a salary based on their ability to do that.<p>Conversely, you as a founder of a business are compensated based on your own success. <i>Taking investment is not an indicator of success</i>. Investment money is to grow the business faster than it could on its own. Revenue, and more importantly profit, are where you see your own success. The large exit for many funded startups is also more commonly heard about success indiactor, because solid monthly margins aren't a) usually reported for private companies and b) don't make very interesting news, where as a big sale usually is/does.<p>Starting and owning a business is an entirely different world from being an employee, and never should you apply the principles of one to the other.",1368726968

5719953,comment,5718265,5718662,1,0,grey-area,,,"Applescript forms an interesting counter-point to your argument - it attempted to use something as close to natural language as possible. As a result it is verbose, complex to debug, and difficult to guess at the syntax as applications often use slightly different concepts for the same things. It's never been a popular language with programmers, and has only seen more widespread use by non-programmers when it was hidden from sight with Automator.<p>In contrast many (but not all) of the popular languages to program in today are as simple as possible (Ruby, Python, Go, etc...), and have a tightly controlled syntax and limited keywords, partly inspired by the example of Lisp. They may allow constructing simple sentences with verbs (functions) and nouns (variables), but they are carefully limited in the sentences and syntax they allow, and often don't require any UI other than a plain text editor. They certainly don't require NLP or AI and I can't see any move in that direction.",1368726957

The most pragmatic one was that we don't have an optimizer and we thought that secondary indexes could still be useful to a lot of people without one. And we've found it's always better to ship early and get feedback sooner rather than later.<p>Another reason though is we're not totally sure we're sold on the state of the art of query optimizers. From what we've seen they can introduce a number of non intuitive behaviors and it can be hard to tell which operations will use which index. Query optimizers are nice when they work correctly but they don't always work correctly so for the first release of secondary indexes we opted to make something that had very clear precise semantics and then build on it. We will eventually have a query optimizer but it's a big problem and we don't just want to implement what others have because we think we can do better.",1368726910

- Javascript -> Callback passing for an asynchronous computing paradigm. Object-array duality and prototype-based inheritance.
- Ruby -> Rubyists often like to be clever with chaining several functions on one line to do something succinctly.

The startup is actually quite flex where I work, so we can go have longer lunches, run errands during the day, work from home, etc. My team goes out to party and let our hair down on weekends as well. I didn't join the startup blindly, I'm still young and have the passion to put a lot of energy in something I really believe in. Actually, truth be told, I wake up really excited about what I'm doing and I didn't have this feeling compared to my 9-6 job. But I agree I have to stay disciplined and that's the hard part.

People shouldn't have to work below market rate (or for free, as they often do) to implement their own ideas.<p>Because they actually care about their work, they'll be 5-20x more productive, and that's what the value of the equity (shared between them and investors) comes from. I argue that they should be paid <i>at</i> market rate for more typical work. Why should they have to <i>pay</i> me to work for me when they're already signing up to work 5-20x harder than typical corporate employees?<p>Yet sanctimonious VCs still talk as if they're performing a charity rather than investing. It should be a symbiotic relationship (a transfer of control over capital from those who have it to those who know what best to do with it) rather than this ""I've got the money, so lick my balls"" arrangement that currently exists.<p>My argument is that valuations should be higher in order to include a fair salary for the founders. In fact, given the monstrous amount of bullshit involved in raising money, I'd argue that an even higher salary is in order.<p>By the way, the reason VC is losing money is not that they valuate companies too high or that founders take too much out in salary. It's that they have a herd mentality and they suck at picking companies. Have you <i>seen</i> some of the assholes they fund? I could do a better job than 99% of those gatekeepers, and I don't even have an MBA. I'm just a far better judge of talent than they are. (I'm not a great judge of character, which is why I've worked for some horrible companies; I'd need to hire a partner for that. Judging talent and character are opposite skill sets. But I'm one of the best judges of talent out there, and almost certainly in the top 100-- at judging talent, not in having it-- in the world today.)<p>VCs are trying to put founders into a race to the bottom, not only on valuation/salary but more dangerously on terms (e.g. liquidation preferences) and autonomy; those are far more severe because they create an adverse selection where the best people avoid you outright. I'd do it very differently. I'd give very generous terms-- I would actually make it a fireable offense for any associate even to suggest participating preferred or multiple liquidation preferences-- but make a lot more money than any of them by not falling into the traps (mostly, social obligations to fund undeserving morons to return favors) that cause other VCs to fund idiots.",1368726344

You can't read in parallel, but I do understand the idea of backgrounding links to visit later - so you don't necessarily break the flow of the page you are currently on.<p>Back in the day of dial up, I'd use Opera and disable images - to make page loads quicker.  I would  connect the modem, go online, open as many links as possible in different tabs, and then disconnect.   And read at my leisure.<p>It would force me to think upfront at what I wanted to look at, and in the main it was a pretty good system.<p>Pages back then would take a long time to load, especially with images - so background loading your next link, was a habit that you just got into.<p>I forget which browser has which behaviour with new tabs.  Some place the tab on the end.  Which makes sense in terms of using a stack.  Your last link being opened being on the end.  Firefox as it does tab scrolling, makes it hard to see what you have open.   So I think now the default is to open the new tab next to the current tab.   Which highlights another inconsistency in between application tab behaviour.<p>I used to have loads of tabs open of stuff, that I'd get around to reading at some point - but I'd basically never read, or it would become overwhelming - and I'd just periodically shut all the tabs and start again.  Later I thought I'd bookmark anything that grabbed my attention, and go back to it later.  Recent bookmarks can help there.<p>I don't see much difference between a bookmark and a tab, a tab though just feels a little more accessible but it's more expensive.  Better bookmarking tools could make tabs easily redundant.<p>The 'group your tabs' feature of Firefox, just doesn't work for me, and other tab plugins haven't worked for me either.  Opera has tab stacks, but I can't say I'm that fond of them either.  I'd rather something a little more automated.<p>Anyway - way off the original topic...",1368726093

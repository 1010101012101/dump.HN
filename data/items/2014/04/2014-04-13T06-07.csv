Often the nuances of some business are best understood by those competing for that business. And let&#x27;s be honest, for most of us the nuances of the VC world are poorly understood outside of actual VC companies. Sure, the basics are understood, but as with any business the specialists know more than the generalist.<p>So let&#x27;s hypothesize that Marc understands this nuance, and wants to alert people to the issue. Clearly the warning benefits him at the same time as benefiting those being warned. Does he then speak out, or keep quiet?<p>To frame the question in a general sense, in situations where you have a credibility problem, do you go ahead anyway, or keep quiet and let others take the fall? What would you do? As far as i can tell it&#x27;s a no-win situation.<p>I was in a similar position last year, and chose to write the warning anyway. I disclosed the conflict of interest - even though, like in this case the connection was obvious. To those being warned. Predictably I got a fair bit of negative response, but I like to think, if nothing else, it helped people at least take a bit more time to evaluate the situation.(I got some positive responses as well.)<p>So hats off to Marc. He&#x27;ll get pilloried here, and elsewhere, but maybe one day if I go looking for VC funding, this is one more tidbit of knowledge that I&#x27;ll have, which I probably wouldn&#x27;t get anywhere else unless I learned it the hard way.<p>Full disclosure: I have no connection to Marc or any other VC. I don&#x27;t know what his motive is, suffice to say that it could be either, and assuming the worst is not necessarily valid.",1397371453

It&#x27;s time to speak with an attorney.<p>If you have some sort of share vesting schedule which will grant you an equity ownership percentage that you consider &quot;fair&quot; then you should consider moving from your current operational position as a software engineer to somewhere else if you want to stay in operations. Otherwise you can sit it out, keep your equity, and participate at the board level.<p>There will be lots of advice to just &quot;forget about it and walk away&quot;. I believe the advice to essentially just &quot;sit back and take it&quot; to be idiotic. If your original positioning on the team was to be &quot;the guy who programs the first iteration of the software that gets us to market&quot; and you failed at that, I can understand where they&#x27;re trying to push you out as a co-founder. You essentially were a technical co-founder who only partially fulfilled his/her original promise. No offence. In their eyes, you misrepresented yourself, even if that&#x27;s untrue because they scope-creeped way past your skill level. But the fact is that there WAS some weight that was pulled by you. So you deserve at least partial compensation, whether or not its in the form of equity (if this was promised to you) or payment, or both.<p>There&#x27;s some important variables here that have&#x27;t been covered (mainly current legal agreements) but the main point I&#x27;d drive home is stand up for yourself and don&#x27;t allow yourself to get power played. Yes the situation is sour, but you should be able to get the rest of your founders to agree that you DID contribute something, (as evidenced by the fact that the CTO wants you to leave in the future, not now) so you deserve some equity/payment even if you end up just leaving with it and participating in a liquidity event in the future.<p>TL;DR If no legal agreements: attorney. If legal agreements w/vague equity terms: attorney. If legal agreements w/ defined equity program you can live with: leave operations, participate at the board level, get bought out at a premium, or just hold equity and wait for a liquidity event.<p>Make sure there&#x27;s some restrictions keeping the board from authorizing 1000000000000000 shares and diluting you out too.

We are always looking for ways to get our projects more open and accepted by the traditional open-source community. Our default option when adding new products on the marketplace is GPL + a commercial license (which is the option you mention). Most developers still pick only our own proprietary licenses, since they are worried about people abusing it.<p>We are also in touch with the OSI for creating a 100% open-source compatible license of our own that could be officially sponsored by them. It&#x27;s been a slow process, but we hope to get it done in the near future. Our own license was created with the help of copyright lawyer that has dedicated his professional life to supporting and advocating open-source. It is a compromise between closed-source / commercial and fully open-source (what we call &quot;commercial open-source&quot;). For many purposes, it is less restrictive than the GPL (no stipulation on releasing your source if you modify and distribute on other formats), which makes it more attractive to businesses building commercial products (for example, iOS application, which cannot use GPL).<p>Hope that makes sense!",1397370914

Once you have internalized this and you&#x27;re still breathing, it will become easier to see the positives.<p>As others have said, it&#x27;s highly likely that the CTO and CEO are working together on this. The best thing you can do is - with the assistance of your lawyer - extract yourself as quickly and cleanly as you can manage. Try not to burn bridges; legitimately hope that they succeed. After all, you will retain a substantial percentage of the company.<p>I can&#x27;t know the details but from the way you describe the situation, I&#x27;m somewhat empathetic to the position that the CTO finds himself in. Your only claim to power is that you were there at the beginning. While that&#x27;s not a small detail, it&#x27;s often true that the people who are vitally important to a company in the beginning end up being minor players in the future. See: Craig Newmark or the early support reps at eBay.<p>In short: you&#x27;re a founder who is probably no longer playing an irreplaceable role in your company. The CTO wants a meritocracy, and when you&#x27;re a small team shooting for growth, a founder with just enough tech chops to be a distraction is a major source of risk. To this end, I am surprised that they didn&#x27;t give you notice already.<p>I don&#x27;t say any of this to be mean, it&#x27;s just that these relationships are hard and most people let awkwardness keep them from telling the hard truth.",1397370808

More accurately, the company I co-founded was no Facebook.)  I launched something with two good friends in May 2010, got ousted in November 2011, and have watched the damn thing flourish, predictably, ever since...  Here&#x27;s what I think I learned from that experience:<p>First, you&#x27;re asking the wrong question. Whether CTO Boy has &quot;a point,&quot; and/or is within &quot;boundaries&quot; (whatever that means) is just self-inflicted misdirection.  Reflect on these questions later.  For now, the important thing is to make sure that you aren&#x27;t haunted by doubts over whether you were fairly treated, so that your ability to learn and grow from this experience isn&#x27;t hopelessly tainted by acrimony and distrust.<p>Second, recognize that once you&#x27;ve lost the confidence of your co-founder(s), for whatever reason(s), it&#x27;s best to let them go.  It&#x27;s a free world, or at least it ought to be, and nobody should have to work with anybody they don&#x27;t want to.  That being said, your stake as a founder is worth something, and if the others want to take the operation over for themselves, they need to buy you out at a fair price.  Regardless of whether you&#x27;re a 23-year-old n00b or if you&#x27;re Marc Andreesen (-- say, wasn&#x27;t he 23 when... never mind --) what you need to be doing right now is tapping every available resource -- every mentor, teacher, counselor, former manager, and experienced friend -- for an outside perspective.  Hate to say it, but HN doesn&#x27;t count.  We don&#x27;t know enough about your business to really understand your situation or know how to respond to it.<p>Third, don&#x27;t undermine your short-term position with free concessions.  If they intend to cut you loose, but nonetheless can&#x27;t survive without your help for the next 3-6 more months, that sounds like value that you&#x27;re uniquely qualified to supply, and if they want you to forego the long-term returns on that investment, they need to compensate you for that in the short term.  So, <i>DO</i> consult with an attorney and/or a seasoned entrepeneur to make sure you&#x27;re not getting screwed.<p>All that being said, if you can manage to let your co-founders go their own way while being neither a dick nor a pushover, the community will respect you for it further on up the road.<p>Good luck.",1397369425

7580421,comment,7579845,7579845,7,0,icambron,,,"Leave. Seriously, walk away. Here are some thoughts:<p>1. The situation is poisoned. If you stay and force a battle of wills, it will be hugely distracting in a way that adds no value to the company (and remember, building a great company is why you did this in first place), not to mention personally painful for you. That the CEO and CTO have lost confidence in you means it&#x27;s just going to suck from here on out. Even if you win, that just means disempowering the CTO (or replacement CTO if the current one leaves in frustration, which doesn&#x27;t seem improbable). Maybe the CTO is wrong, but if he&#x27;s saddled with someone he doesn&#x27;t want and can&#x27;t get rid of because of special cofounder status, it&#x27;s going to create a pretty shitty working environment for everyone. And if he wins (say, because the CEO votes you out), then that&#x27;s the same as you sliding out anyway.<p>2. The CTO definitely hasn&#x27;t overstepped his boundaries; he&#x27;s doing his job. He&#x27;s responsible for running the engineering team and delivering a product. If he thinks you&#x27;re holding the company back, he&#x27;d be being irresponsible not to do something about it. Of course, he could be <i>wrong</i> and there&#x27;s no way for me (or anyone else here) to determine that. So you have to ask yourself what you really think is best for the company. If it&#x27;s you leaving, tanking the company in a huge fight (or just dragging it down by sticking around) will just destroy whatever equity you have in it. If it&#x27;s you staying and you&#x27;re confident (after putting aside your ego, considering it from other peoples&#x27; views, etc), then yeah, convince the CEO and then together fire the CTO for being so terribly wrong. But it&#x27;s not an issue of boundaries. So: would you hire you?<p>3. Closely related: what are you doing cofounding companies with that little confidence in yourself? If someone came to you and said, &quot;hey, I haven&#x27;t coded much and don&#x27;t have a lot of experience&quot;, would you think that was a wise investment? Because you went all in on that investment. Do some work with some guidance and lower stakes and learn your craft. I don&#x27;t at all mean that as &quot;noob go home&quot; (I have <i>no idea</i> how good you actually are); I mean that your description basically acknowledges you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re the right person for the job of technical cofounder.<p>4. Your CEO sounds clueless and you should take this opportunity to bail out. If the CTO is wrong about you, the CEO&#x27;s confidence in him is misplaced and he&#x27;s also allowing unnecessary complications to destroy his engineering team. If the CTO is right that you don&#x27;t even belong on the team, then why did the CEO partner with you in the first place? Maybe he thought of you as a temporary pawn to sacrificed at the right time. Maybe he just doesn&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s doing. None of those are good. Get out.<p>5. You say in one of the comments that you don&#x27;t want to lose your unvested shares and that you&#x27;ve taken on a lot of opportunity cost. The whole point of the vesting is that you get what you&#x27;ve worked for. If you don&#x27;t think the vested equity you have is commensurate with the work you&#x27;ve done, <i>working more</i> isn&#x27;t going to fix that. You&#x27;ll just continue getting screwed, putting in more time and earning the same vesting that you&#x27;re unhappy with. I know you probably feel pot-committed, but the best thing to do when you have a bad hand is fold your cards and move on.<p>6. Startups are hard. They&#x27;re painful work, especially when things go bad, to the point that I wonder why we do it in the best of situations. If you throw in the stress of trying to prove you even belong, it&#x27;s just shitty. Save your happiness and leave.<p>7. It&#x27;s important not to think of these decisions as an affront to your pride. The never-say-die bromide of startup cofounders the world over is mostly bullshit. Make sure you&#x27;re in a healthy situation with a real chance of success. Quitting isn&#x27;t shameful, but sabotaging your happiness and the value of your investment because it hurts your ego is very unwise. I don&#x27;t know whether or not <i>I&#x27;d</i> be wise in that situation either--I certainly have plenty of ego--but of course that&#x27;s why you asked us: we&#x27;re not involved.<p>My guess is that once you leave, clear your head, and figure out what you want to do next, you&#x27;ll look back and say, &quot;wow, I&#x27;m glad I got out of that.&quot;",1397369295

It&#x27;s basically DeviantArt, but amateur artists on pixiv have often practiced for years and their art is technically good, whereas DeviantArt posters are all more than satisfied with their weird fetish art they drew in MS Paint.<p>You could try Korea, which is a lot more like America.

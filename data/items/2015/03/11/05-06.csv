Seeing a physician to have them prescribe medication can be expensive, sure, but the medication itself is also very expensive. Lowering/eliminating the cost of seeing a physician is a different problem entirely.  This seems like a fantastic step in the right direction to make medication more affordable <i>after</i> a qualified physician prescribes it.",1426053451

On the other hand, at least the process is renewable unlike fossil fuels.

You could build cities where you don&#x27;t need millions of people to consume fuel in order to merely get by their ordinary days moving between work, shopping groceries, and home.

9182783,comment,9180795,9180795,0,0,A_COMPUTER,,,"One of the biggest frustrations to me, and I do believe this is a new thing, is people with evangelistic universalist worldviews joining these groups and expecting everybody to conform to it. I feel like &quot;nerd culture&quot; was partially defined by being made up of the parts left out of mainstream, inherent heterogeneity, rather than a positive set of things, so arguing you&#x27;re right and I&#x27;m wrong and that&#x27;s that, is highly alien. There is a lot of talk about how as nerd interests have become mainstream, the disdain many nerds have for this is a sign of their elitism or desire to just be different. But I think also it is because before it was mainstream, you only got viciously judged by the outgroup, so you could at least go &quot;fuck them, they didn&#x27;t like me anyway&quot; and keep doing your own thing. Now you have people who consider themselves part of that ingroup telling you you&#x27;re doing it wrong and bringing all their social jostling into the group with them trying to make it act the way they want. I don&#x27;t think people are exaggerating when they feel like their groups are being &quot;taken over.&quot;",1426053178

9182779,comment,9180795,9180795,0,0,hyperion2010,,,"This article is so spot on and covers many of the things that have bothered me for years about people who try to join nerd communities and then immediately start complaining about &quot;inappropriate behavior&quot; (eg the dongle thing). Yes, there are cases where there is real inappropriate behavior surrounding positions of power in corporate or workplace settings, but in the community at large and in the communal and public spaces that we now interact no one individual should ever be allowed to determine what is appropriate (much less attack people for their supposed transgressions). We all left the world of &quot;appropriate&quot; because we found it a) useless and b) oppressive. The fact that our conversations are now public means that, if someone goes looking for something to be offended by they are going to find it, and then they play the primate power game and we&#x27;re back to Cardinal Richelieu: &quot;Give me 6 lines written in the hand of the most honest man and I will see him hanged.&quot;<p>That said, this does paint reality for those who do honestly want to see more women involved in tech etc. My take home is that if you keep trying to push on people who intentionally leave &quot;appropriate&quot; communities behind because they don&#x27;t care about those things and find them oppressive, then you are simply going to drive them to leave again and you will have to start all over again.<p>edit: Actual take home.

I&#x27;m very worried about people acting like computers.<p>Every circuit, every program is based on a principle: comparators (analogue) = NAND (digital) = if statements (software). Machines choose their answer by taking a huge amount of information, and sorting it. By design, this leads to some monstrous conclusions. For example, eugenics might be logically efficient, but it is morally abhorrent.<p>Taking risks, making mistakes: these are not flaws, they are the very essence of being human.<p>Test yourself! I guess that everyone on here is very rational (as I am). I only discovered this problem in my character after a conversation with an artist, a good friend from high school. She makes all her decisions based on the heart, rather than the mind. Try to do something totally random! When things make no logical sense, the emotions wake up again. You&#x27;ll &quot;feel&quot; again. It doesn&#x27;t matter if that&#x27;s a good or bad feeling - acting like a machine makes you feel nothing at all. A machine can defend every action it takes, because it&#x27;s never wrong. But machines can&#x27;t apologise.<p>There will be data-driven businesses. They&#x27;re not actually run by humans (whatever the management says), they&#x27;re run by machines. Those companies could ultimately be fully automated away.

9182766,comment,9175119,9178535,0,0,616c,,,"> Hey, didn&#x27;t mean to be brash about it, just being honest so you know how it works.<p>I tried to respond with a mild tone.  I get it.  I do not blame you, and I do appreciate your honesty and good amount of technical detail.  I just get tired of this general tact, by no means your specific words, that tracking is inevitable you cannot stop it.  We have made this culture, and I for one want it gone.  I will not people just accept in a public, specifically HN, if I have energy to oppose it.<p>>The ad networks do care about this since it&#x27;s still lost revenue, but our effect is minimized because we often have much bigger reach than just a few sites and can still serve plenty of ads across the entire web. There is an arms race and the big companies just pay to play. Remember the adblock plugins are usually made by for-profit corporations who will grant exceptions for cash so take from that what you will.<p>Touche.  I had since moved away from the obvious culprits (AdBlock in all variants, disconnect.me) and only use uBlock when I have to allow all through NoScript, as I need content off a website that only renders text content with many CDN&#x27;s and junk enabled (not all former are the latter, but there is overlap).  Now, I can tell default whitelist from NoScript is bought off, so I remove a lot of it from the beginning and set more aggressive defaults by browsing a few comments sites and turning everything off beyond what is necessary.  So I am well aware of that, and try to stick to what I think is right, not trusting adblockers primarily, but NoScript and redirecting many malicious ad and bot networks to my hosts file on my local computer and running a blank webpage.  As others have noted, my browsing performance is better and my experience cleaner.<p>I know by virtue of your interest you do not have that scummy level of ad that necessitates my use of these things, but how can I know to trust you over thousands of companies without auditing all of you?<p>> As for privacy, I have to ask first, what are you trying to accomplish? Remember you can either have accurate ads best fit for you or have complete privacy. We can&#x27;t show you stuff that&#x27;s relevant without tracking, that&#x27;s just reality. I can&#x27;t reveal too much but networks usually start tracking with cookies and some more advanced methods by themselves but as they get bigger, we outsource a lot of the tracking to 3rd party companies who are very good at this. There are lots of browser and device fingerprinting technologies and other information that you give off just to visit and render a site that we can use. Even the internet carriers themselves participate in this and you can&#x27;t really hide from them since most people just have 1 connection. Proxy services will help but again you&#x27;re sacrificing a lot of convenience and speed for what? To stick it to us? Unless you&#x27;re running adblockers, we&#x27;ll just end up serving you generic ads anyway and still tracking as best we can.<p>I want security and my internet profile, even anonymized, used to facilitate garbage I do not approve of.  To be honest, I am sure your company products are not who I am worried about.  But I think I have to not run interactive content using any form of code you send to my machine without express authorization because most self-respecting computer enthusiasts no what that means.  Now if only ad distributors and web apps had centralized repos of JS content, even obfuscated, signed from a central repository that browsers could turn and off like yum/apt/zypper repos, I would been in love (yes, I know this is a joke and pipe dream).<p>I know some clients of your industry feel strongly about this, and prevent me from viewing any page without JS, for ads and otherwise.  There is a balance, and I will walk it.  But as an IT tech of approaching 10 years, I trust no dynamic content in the browser unless I can load the page without it first.  Even I have potentially infected my computer according to work IDS tools.  Me, and you can see unlike 98% of our userbase, I actually care and pay attention.  You better be damn sure I can read text, or it must be a very legit site for <i>my</i> purposes (Github, Reddit, I even disable HN bc they are one of a handful sites I use without JS ever enabled, I loved you for it HN).  I wish it was altruism, but it is really functionality.  I can handle ads, within reason.  But should my belief that potentially malicious hot-loaded content is a concern I am not willing to fight for in court?  I have plenty of broken computers in my office to attest to that.<p>> I think there&#x27;s a massive misconception on what exactly you&#x27;re protecting yourself from. Most user profiles are removed after 15-30-60 days as it becomes stale. We don&#x27;t collect personally identifying information (but facebook does), we don&#x27;t track searches (but google does), and it&#x27;s all just anonymized identifiers. Beyond that, we can always just ask the big data collecting agencies for more information to make a decision without actually collecting/storing anything ourselves (stuff like purchase histories) so you&#x27;re not giving up much there either. I do understand the battle for privacy but in lots of situations, the issues are overblown if you want my honest opinion.<p>I think yes, I owe you a concession.  But I want to be clear, the big fish in this giant ocean are destroying the tolerance we have for operations like yourself: small-pond fish trying to make it big.  I do not trust the FB, Google, or Social Anything.  I try to browse Google search results with static HTML if possible (now using DDG HTML only results more often, or using it as a Google proxy with !g redirect on queries), I hardly ever enable the CDNs or ajaxapis.g.c utility servers on pages on less absolutely necessary since we know they probably store such data in diagnostic logs for decades to come, legal or extra-legally.<p>In the age of secret warrants, why do I need to give you the benefit of the doubt?  I mean, your industry, will all due respect, sells market items; it does not cure cancer.  At a philosophical level (I know this is not where your appeal comes from), why should I trust you?  Other people I trust less than you will petition you for your much larger competitor&#x27;s data and build a public internet profile of what I am up to.  What will stop you from ending up in their dragnet 5-10 years from now?<p>Keep in mind I live in the Arab World.  I am no prude, but even AdWords, for personal and work computers I see daily on many sites, show giant billboard sidebar ads saying Meet Qatari Singles (in of itself hilarious) with women with large breasts and generous cleavage.  I see this even on computers with veiled women working at them.  Even I find this messed up.  When people are on my computer, it makes me look like a sketchball.  If I have to quick search sites at someone&#x27;s desk to research a problem I have not seen before and stumble upon this crap, how do I look?  The extremes of the industry bring good eggs like you down, even the most elite of them.  How should I filter you guys?  This is a hard problem.  I ask rhetorically.<p>Now, if you write an industry rag shame practices and starting to list good example/bad example companies, I wouldl love to read it, as I will know how selective I should be with my filtering.  But for the time being, NoScript on, default Google stuff removed (yes you are right after), and cynicism in full swing.",1426052553

Not saying I can&#x27;t imagine it, or that it&#x27;s not real, but it wasn&#x27;t like that for me. In my experience: video-games were utterly mainstream, MTG/D&D where &quot;a bit weird, but hey, to each their own&quot;, computer programming was cool (not a super popular hobby to pursue, but people seemed either neutral or genuinely impressed if you did).<p>Many of those cherished &quot;hacker values&quot;? They are now mainstream ideals: Net neutrality! Wikileaks! &quot;I prefer texting than talking on the phone&quot;! ;) Everyone I know is now in an online forum or another (Facebook/Twitter/Tumblr/Reddit). Not saying all of the values have been popularized, but many have. Our pop culture now a days makes more fun of jocks than of nerds. It has more nerd heroes (specially for middle-school/high-school aged kids) than &quot;popular&quot; heroes. Freaking LoTR is one of the biggest movie franchises of all times!<p>Besides, it&#x27;s not like the groups have no intersection. Geek feminists often are or were at some point &quot;weird-nerd&quot; girls or &quot;weird-nerd&quot; guys that agreed that the world was, among all of its unfairnesses, biased to take male as the default. So we are not excluding just those &quot;not from our tribe&quot; (whatever that means), we are excluding &quot;those from our tribe happen to be different from what we picture our tribe to <i>look</i> like&quot;. Even for those genuinely not part of the culture you might naturally want to associate with? Well, we still need to interact with and do business with them in a civilized manner. That&#x27;s all any diversity advocacy I have ever read demands: not that you be friends with anybody, but that you be willing to interact respectfully with everybody.<p>&quot;Brogrammer&quot; is less well defined. But the most gym-going and adventurous friend I have is also among the most nerdy, smartest and occasionally painfully awkward people I know.

My impression is taht a lot of VC people have finance backgrounds, and finance is historically not very diverse either. Another way to come at the question might be to acknowledge that there are some heavyweight black investors, but they invest in other areas likes arts and sport where African-Americans have enjoyed more opportunities (and the investors have greater insight into the risks and payoffs of those particular markets than they might into others).",1426050398

In talking about how to handle the lack of fixed schemas within Mongo, the OP refers to using if/else blocks to get around field name changes. This shows a severe lack of understanding of how to work with Mongo at such a fundamental level. If using Mongoid (which he is) you simply need to run `Post.all.rename(title: :post_title)` to do the schema change. This may seem like a nitpick to some people, but honestly if that concept was lost on the developer then its clear that there is little to no credibility to be had in the reporting of all the other Mongo issues.<p>I&#x27;m glad that the OP is growing as a developer and starting to understand the merits of SQL and why having defined schemas is important. SQL is awesome and its not going to be replaced by NoSQL (at least not fully). However please make sure that you are building the foundation of your understanding by fully grasping the technologies that you are already using.",1426050182

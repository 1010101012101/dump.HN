On the other hand, Uber currently benefits greatly from this legally enforced supply restriction that chokes off their competition while not yet applying to them.  Most large cities can dramatically lower the cost of and increase the availability of street-hail cabs by issuing more permits, which can cut into Uber&#x27;s revenue.

So, to answer your question, that is where they are replayed from.<p>The hypothesis is that the hippocampus is unique in being able to store memories quickly and after a single exposure. Most of the rest of the brain needs time and repeated exposures to store a memory via long-term potentiation. The role of the hippocampus is to act as a buffer where memories are kept temporarily.<p>While you&#x27;re sleeping, your hippocampus repeatedly activates the memory, stimulating the brain in a similar way that the original event did. Slowly, the neocortex begins to rewire itself through synaptic plasticity to store the memory. After many repetitions, the memory is no longer dependent on the hippocampus and it fades away.<p>I think this is the paper I&#x27;m recalling this from, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure (this memory is several years old):<p>Bontempi, Bruno, et al. &quot;Time-dependent reorganization of brain circuitry underlying long-term memory storage.&quot; Nature 400.6745 (1999): 671-675.",1402082659

Sometimes because their cousin or grandchild said they should put their savings bonds into tech stocks, sometimes because an aggressive fund manager put in more risk than they bargained for. Either way, people who didn&#x27;t know better got hurt. In this hypervaluation the people at risk are investment bankers that <i>do</i> know better, and if they lose all their money, then fine.

Not everyone will approach you for a distribution partnership because they want margin or affiliate fees. Like I said, big companies often just want to slap partner logos on a web page or brochure.

Nimitz in Honolulu.<p>On the other hand, Leahy also thought the bomb would never work (he even used his &quot;expertise in explosives&quot; to support that argument).<p>And both FDR and Truman had been briefed regarding the two proposed upcoming invasions (of Kyushu and then Honshu) that the American and Japanese casualties would be monumental.<p>MacArthur was always thought he was the politician as much as he was the general; it&#x27;s the reason he was fired from his service in the Korean War despite his absolutely brilliant orchestration of the Incheon landings to save the war effort for the U.N.<p>He&#x27;s not even wrong in this regard though: Using the atom bomb was not <i>absolutely militarily essential</i>.

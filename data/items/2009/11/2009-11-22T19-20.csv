They get better in terms of antique value, and some differences will happen to the instrument over time - which may make it better, and may make it worse.  the antique value is something that really p's me off - the sound quality seems to have no impact on price, while antique value has loads.<p>Where are these tests anyway?<p>blind tests are always a bit of a waste of time - you get a player to play 5 different instruments - the one that most closely matches the playing 'profile' of their normal instrument is the one that wins...  (assuming they use their normal bow, and set of strings, and that the sound post is set up correctly for their playing...)",1258917060

  everyday, loosely overloaded sense.  As in, you telling 
  your friend, “you are such a !@##$ sociopath.”  I want to 
  stick to the term for two good reasons. One: Hugh 
  Macleod’s original cartoon which inspired this series is 
  too good to give up. Second, distrust of communities and 
  groups, and a stubborn individualism, are the main 
  personality characteristics here (and this position is 
  not original to me; it is derived from William Whyte). 
  Words like “player” or “enlightened” (two suggested 
  alternatives) don’t cut it.

956047,comment,955635,955723,0,0,chrjozefharibo,,,"For performing a quantum algorithm two sets of gates are needed, for instance single qubit rotations and a square root of swap gate. A hadamard gate is another example of a universal gate. Starting up your quantum computer, you will      find it in its ground state, that is the state where all qubits are in their lowest energy state. From there you start to apply q gates to the qubits. These gates make the Hamiltonian of the system evolve in time. Depending on THE sequence of gate operations on qubits, you evolve from one state to the other, performing a certain algorithm. Read out of the final state depends on the implementation of the qubit. For atoms and diamond nv centers you can use a laser. For electron spins you can use a charge detector, for flux qubits you measure a magnetic field.",1258916784

He seems distrustful of ""group morality"" (incidentally, I would argue that morality is inherently a function of groups) yet claims more sociopaths is a ""good"" thing.

As defined by the group morality he finds questionable elsewhere?</i><p>I'm unfamiliar with the author, but one possible way of resolving the apparent contradiction would be to distinguish between ""good vs. evil"" and ""good vs. bad"" - a solution originally, as far as I know, proposed by Nietzsche, where ""good vs. evil"" is a matter of group, ""slave"" morality, while ""good vs. bad"" is a matter of ""master"" morality.  It actually maps quite cleanly to what the author is talking about, though I'm uncertain whether or not that is deliberate.<p>Edit: Also, statements like<p><i>(you're either slavish and unthinking, or a sociopath)</i><p>feel a bit like misreading the author to me; he's abusing the word ""sociopath"", which can be criticized, but here you appear to be using it in a non-value-neutral manner, which rather misses the point of the article.",1258916631

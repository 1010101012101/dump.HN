330140,comment,329859,330115,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"I think we should stop banning sites as a solution to moderation.<p>All this TC backlash is getting somewhat ridiculous but at the same time it is what it is. There's plenty of tech news sites out there but they all report on the same news because they all read the same feeds and have access to the same scoops. The only way to differentiate is to editorialize the news. It's much the same as 24 hour cable news.<p>But choosing to write 746 word blog posts or pounding TC with all these comments or upvoting these things to #1 is the real problem HN has. I really wish people would just let these minor things go.<p>Stop upvoting LAME stories. Stop upvoting whiney blog posts ABOUT lame stories. A bit of self control is a lot more powerful than censoring websites.",1223790749
330139,story,,,34,84,startingup,"The world *has* changed: Why we should be afraid",,"This is a sort of rebuttal to optimists, who believe ""it will blow over"". I believe the world has fundamentally changed. It is not merely a financial crisis. It is a fundamental economic crisis. The last two weeks brought the crisis to full focus, but we have been building up to it for several years.<p>Here are a few things that happened in the last 10-20 years that have brought us to this point:<p>1. Debt became fashionable, even prestigious, world-wide. The most storied names in business became debtaholics. This includes the financial players like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, but industrial-companies-that-became-financial-companies, like GM, Ford, GE and so on. This level of comfort with debt is unprecedented in history, and the historical parallels are dark.<p>2. The most prestigious nation on earth piled on debt, and other nations copied. US Debt/GDP is at 320%, much higher than even the great depression peak. Derivatives further magnify the leverage - as an example, AIG went down because of the magnified leverage not captured on their balance sheet.<p>3. US savings rate dropped from 10% in the mid 80s to near zero today, and it even went negative for a period.<p>History teaches us that such toxic debt episodes are followed by a prolonged hang-over, followed by a social aversion to debt and eventual recovery. The patient has just passed out - the hanger over hasn't even started. It is way too soon to talk about a recovery.<p>So it is very appropriate to be very concerned and fearful for our collective futures. What can we do as individuals? Swear off debt, live very frugally, lower our expectations.<p>To paraphrase, just because a lot of people are panicking doesn't mean we shouldn't be really afraid!",1223790689

As a blogger, I don't need to have signed up to you, the money is being collected just the same.<p>Then, begin contacting bloggers and letting them know that they have X in an account with you, and they'd probably want to collect it.  That would work.  That would work and it would be best done by the AdBlockPlus people.<p>Edit: AdBlockPlus is (from what I gather on their website) OpenSource and currently lacking a business model.  You could probably start working from there on, like AdBlockPlus, Good Samaritan Edition or something",1223789854

I realize that the record companies are claiming that they missed out on sales, but imagine this: You run a red light (breaking the law) and hit an executive on the way to a big client meeting. Are you liable for his missing out on a multimillion dollar contract?",1223789766

I'm reading a book review and thinking about buying it, perhaps.  But if I can be referred and the entire process takes two clicks, I'm much more likely to do it.  Why pay?  To give reviewers motivation to it; plus, that's the marketplace.  You think Barnes & Noble don't have an affiliate program?<p>Affiliate code for inc: That's a tougher one.  I doubt Joel actually gets paid for the viewers he brings to Inc, more likely there for traffic purposes.  Paid affiliates to news sites kind of scare me, yeah.<p>2nd page: yeah, as a reader I LOATH this, especially now that NYTimes.com has removed the 'single page' button.

Organizations acting without moral, conscience, responsibility and ethically towards real humans/natural persons can certainly happen, but it goes without saying, that it also does have consequences. This is what I pointed out: <i>You cannot blame people for hating dishonest legal persons.</i><p>Acting such and expecting loyalty and gratitude in the same time is hard to achieve.<p>History is littered with examples, and I am inclined to think the recurrence of such attitude is partially responsible for the self-inflicted trouble we face.<p><i>""We learn from history that we learn nothing from history.""</i> -- George Bernard Shaw<p>Cisco is relevant, because History is relevant, from my point of view.<p><i>""When Americans say ""that is history"", they often mean it is no longer relevant. When Europeans say ""that is history"", they usually mean the opposite.""</i> -- Javier Solana, 2006",1248515629

723129,comment,722294,722472,0,0,__david__,,,"Well, take a look from Apple's perspective. They spent time and money developing a platform for their iPods. Why would they want to allow their free (for consumers) music platform to seamlessly work with a direct competitor's product?<p>So Apple gets to support iTunes and polish it for years and then Palm gets to leech off their hard work and use it for free without repercussion?<p>I think by disabling the Pre they're saying to Palm, ""Hey, Palm, why don't you go spend your own millions of dollars and build your own damn app."" When you look at it that way I can't really fault them.<p>What I suspect will happen is that Apple and Palm will battle back and forth for a few revisions over a few months and then Palm will cave and throw some money at Apple (or something else they want) and we'll hear about some sort of partnership and suddenly hey, look, the Pre will be supported officially. Either that or Palm will give up and make their own music uploader.",1248514564

They don't have to wait on the hardware manufacturers to innovate, and they don't have to support their shoddy hardware and drivers.</i><p>Not wanting to test your OS with a myriad of different hardware is one thing.  Stopping VMWare from supporting it as a guest OS is another.  There's no technical reason that I shouldn't be able to run OSX on top of VMWare (I know there's hacks to get it to work, but it's slow as molasses).<p>Apple is more than happy to allow VMWare to develop and sell Fusion so I can run Windows on top of Apple hardware.  How is it that they don't allow me to run OSX on top of my Windows box?",1248514464

723126,comment,722517,722841,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"the people who espouse economic equality are unaware of the outcomes of their actions.  the whole point of being an economist is to draw people's attention to the non-obvious impact of various decisions about resource allocation.<p>the average person: A causes B!  we want more of B so let's increase A!<p>economist: A and B are both side effects of C, pumping resources into A will not produce the desired effect.<p>I agree that economists should avoid making value judgments as much as possible so that people will listen to them.  Robin Hanson recently debated Brian Caplan on exactly this point and made a very convincing case that economists should focus on the efficiency of outcomes.",1248514179

The CGI characters fit more seamlessly into the scene, yes, but I find mocuh more easy to ignore the small imperfections of green screen compositing than the weird movements of CGI characters.",1248514122

The comment you first quote merely presumes that an employer will not pay MORE than what an employee is worth, and all of your ""the employer has more information and power"" arguing is supporting, not refuting, the original claim.",1248513692
723119,comment,722874,723082,0,0,CrLf,,,"There was a time when icc was really ahead of gcc on Intel processors.<p>When I worked in the chemistry department of my university, we did some compiler benchmarks on Pentium 4's, AMD Athlons and even some Alphas (gcc vs. compaq compiler in this case). We did this at a time where icc was being touted as best than sliced bread, but found out that while it mostly outperformed gcc on the Pentiums, it did so by a small margin. On the Athlons gcc was faster across the board. On the Alphas, gcc was also better (except on fortran code, where compaq compiler was <i>way</i> better).<p>And this was gcc 3.x. Since then gcc has evolved quite a bit, and I wouln't be surprised to see it take the performance crown everywhere if I repeated these benchmarks today.",1248513206

3675264,comment,3675047,3675166,14,0,drostie,,,"There's also a worthwhile case study in the Neopets economy, which as far as I know didn't really adapt in these ways. You could grind on puzzle games for the local currency, but it stopped being about the puzzles and started being about trying to make in-game money. And then, what happened is that non-casual gamers would know all of the shop-inventory respawn times and would camp them, to buy up all of the commodities that the shops contained -- especially medicines and such. They would then resell them for much more money in their own user-defined shops. So it became the exact opposite: at first things were really easy to obtain, and they were mostly going after kids -- casual gamers. But their surge in popularity seemed to create a change in focus towards hardcore gamers eager to camp the spawn points and use multiple accounts to get freebies. At one point I even remember putting all of my money in the stock market just so that I could feed my Neopets with free soup from the in-game welfare department, because getting food was such a nuisance otherwise.<p>There is a deeper question lurking beneath all of this, I feel -- and unfortunately for me it has deep ties with questions of meaning and purpose and thus gets bound up in my religion, which I do not want to talk too much about here. But the question is, ""what makes a game worthwhile? why do you keep playing?"" My Neopets were not very worthwhile and, since they're immortal, I imagine they've been starving in a cold computer database for the last way-too-many years. I obviously got bored with the grind necessary to take care of them, but why? Why did I complete all of Morrowind and yet found Oblivion impossible to play? What is it in my human quest that I am looking to create in a game, and are games unreal or real or hyper-real or something else? If we don't enjoy ""having it all handed to us"" but yet we also don't enjoy ""working for it"", what exactly do we want?",1331124443

The trick is knowing other tools in sufficient depth to know when Excel is an anti-pattern.<p>Which is hard, b/c it's so flexible that it gets adapted to a lot of stuff it really shouldn't be.  A big chunk of Corporate America uses Excel the way our foreprogrammers used Perl or Bash, adapting it to all manner of tasks because it's what they know.  I admire their resourcefulness (and scorn their IT environment for limiting their access to better tools) but that handiness leads them into solutions that are fragile, unmaintainable, uncheckable and unscaleable.<p>The step from Excel to broader, more flexible tools is the move away from graphically delineated relationships to logically stated relationships.  It's a very hard step, and one most people won't make unless they force themselves through a period of clumsiness while they orient themselves to a new approach.<p>Exercises like the OP are a great way to do just that: ""I'm going to force myself in this direction by setting some simple but arbitrary obstacle that will build capabilities I can use elsewhere.""  Doing so on tasks that are well understood may help even more -- ""I know how I would do this in Excel, how do I do it in Python?"" -- because your knowledge of the problem frees you to learn the new things about this new sort of solution.<p>The OP isn't saying the CLI is the right tool for everything, he's saying this is a way to build the understanding that lets you move to it freely when it is the right.",1331123348

3675203,comment,3673976,3673976,13,0,qxcv,,,"There seems to be a lot of discussion here about Android v. iOS, but I feel like people are neglecting to discuss a key part of the article:<p>> what's wrong with Android from the perspective of someone planning a long-term 1:1 deployment in a school<p>There's nothing wrong with Android. The problem is that you're trying to throw expensive toys at school students in the hope that you'll win the award for ""Digital Curriculum Innovator"". As a student and 1:1 program participant, the notion that tablets are even remotely useful as educational tools makes me incredibly frustrated. These devices are designed for light web browsing and viewing images and videos, not the sort of tasks that students actually <i>need</i> portable devices for like writing down notes, typing up assignments in class and communicating with their instructors via email.<p>> My question was then, and remains this: where are the apps to challenge iMovie, GarageBand, Keynote, OmniFocus, OmniGraffle, Soulver, Flipboard, iThoughts, Noteshelf, Collabracam, The Elements, Brushes and ArtRage?<p>This sounds an awful lot like the sort of thing you would use a laptop for. Perhaps a more useful question would be:<p>> Where are the apps to challenge Geogebra, Mathematica, CMap, AutoCAD, Photoshop and Office?<p>or<p>> How am I going to interface my expensive light sensors or CNC machine with a tablet?<p>The applications mentioned in the article give me the impression that there isn't much serious work being done on these things. Students need technology skills which will be useful in the workforce, which usually means using the same hardware and software which you are likely to encounter in the workforce. Nowadays you have relatively advanced topics like robotics and video editing being taught to 4th-graders, meaning that by the time they are twelve they have already started learning how to use music composition software (think Sibelius) and commercial CNC machines. Tablets and smartphones just aren't capable enough.<p>Sorry if this sounds a bit harsh, but sometimes I feel like educators need to spend more time educating and less time reinventing the wheel.",1331123061

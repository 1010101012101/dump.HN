1799293,comment,1798241,1798586,0,0,ergo98,,,"Android 2.2 is <i>excellent</i>. It easily competes with iOS on many metrics, beating it in some areas.<p>Phones like the Samsung Galaxy S (esp. the Pro), the Droid 2, the Droid X -- <i>excellent</i> devices that are hyper-competitive. Few with such a device would look jealously on an iPhone.<p>So no...on the phone front Android is top tier. Yeah, subjectively someone will say that the iPhone is all roses for them, but that's the value of a competitive market -- you pick the one that fits you best. On the tablet market it is future tense because, I suspect, Google really didn't want Android to be the tablet OS. They wanted ChromeOS to take that crown. I don't talk tablets when the conversation is about Android.",1287277034

Your ability to guide the conversation, and my ability to follow, and our resultant ability to establish a rapport and keep the conversation moving, is what is under test here. The problem itself is far less important.<p>P.S. I have seen that XOR trick before, once, but it still blows my mind.

I first tried them a few years ago, before they were trendy and available in mainstream stores, while I was having some therapy for a recurring knee problem. My physio had suggested that the cause might be turning out more with one foot than the other, and since MBTs encourage a better walking action, they seemed like they might help.<p>I can't say whether it was the specialist physio exercises or the MBTs that did more to help my immediate problem at the time, but I can vouch for many of the claims that MBT marketing tends to make. They do reduce that nasty impact on each step (which you probably don't notice until you have another problem, but then you <i>really</i> do). They did encourage me to walk with both feet aligned properly, and on the odd occasions that I've had a similar problem again over the years, switching back to MBTs for a while has rapidly cured it. You definitely feel the more active use of certain muscle groups when you first switch to them, but in my case I found that after using them for a few days, all kinds of minor irritations that might be explained by relative weakness/imbalance in those muscle groups started to clear up.<p>They <i>are</i> expensive shoes, but if the pairs I've had are at all representative, the quality means they last way longer than expensive-but-not-that-expensive regular shoes anyway. I always have at least one pair in good condition now, and at the first sign of any irritation in my legs (usually if I haven't been doing much physical training for a few weeks and I'm getting out of condition) on they go.<p>The only major downside I've found is that because of the curved sole, MBTs aren't particularly comfortable to stand around in for extended periods. These shoes are made for walking, not standing (or running/sports).<p>For the record, I have no commercial interest related to MBTs, I'm just a very satisfied customer.",1287275351

1799238,comment,1797964,1797964,0,0,moron4hire,,,"This is why I don't give programming problems as questions. I've written numerous database applications and I really couldn't tell you off of the top of my head all of the parameters to make a proper database connection. When a mathematician writes a formula, it's a communication from one mathematician to another of intent. When a programmer writes code, it's primarily instructing the machine how to perform a given calculation; as such, it's an exercise in tedium and not very appropriate for person-to-person communication.<p>So, that's why I ask design problems. I ask candidates to draw diagrams of databases that meet a certain need. I ask them to draw flow charts and state diagrams. These are much more conducive to <i>human</i> communication. I need to know that they can <i>think</i> before they can program. I'd hire someone with no experience in Python to start a brand new project in Python if they showed they had excellent problem solving skills because the hows of writing Python code is just going to be one more problem to solve for them. They'll figure it out and do what they need to do.<p>When was the last time you know everything about how to program something before you started on the project? If the answer is ""ever"", did you stick around for the end or quit because you were bored?",1287275037

Dabbled in a working in php at the end of that, seemed a little sloppy as a language.<p>Then I just stopped programming for a long while.  Did other things for a living, other things for hobbies.

It feels like it's designed for slow, plodding steps, and writing code in it feels like I'm doing a lot of favors for the language rather than working on something interesting.<p>Right now I'm building small stuff in Python and dabbling in Clojure.  Python lets me feel like the language is not at all a source of friction.  I write the code as fast as I know what the code should be doing.  Java does not feel like that at all.   It's got its limitations, and there's certain things I'd drop back into C for if I wanted to do them, but Python is a language I can almost ignore while I'm using it, if that makes sense.<p>Clojure is a whole different animal, and I'm mostly using it to stretch my brain a bit.

He dismissed as ""weak"" the authors' argument that they could find evidence for other diseases of ageing, such as arthritis and hardening of the arteries, and that cancer should therefore have shown up too.

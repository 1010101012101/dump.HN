Or the only reason one could avoid disappointment when doing so.<p>At the end of the day, maybe this wasn't something I <i>had</i> to do, but it was something I <i>wanted</i> to do. And it has certainly been an incredibly rewarding experience. Overall, I am anything but disappointed. I've made many great friends, grown exponentially as a programmer and designer, even gotten a taste of the investment world.<p>Sure, sometimes it sucks, but never <i>once</i> have I said to myself, ""I would've been better off getting a job.""

I think it's part the color scheme, part the in-your-face layout, and part the overwhelming feed on the left side. If I just took a quick glance, I would think this is a blog, not a startup.<p>So you do screencasts? What type of screencasts? If that isn't inherently obvious at the start then a potential customer may feel left in the dark. The only place I can be for sure that these are developer screencasts is the tiny ""kickass developer screencasts"" text under the logo.<p>Be obvious with what you do! Peepcode (<a href=""http://peepcode.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://peepcode.com/</a>) is an excellent model for a screencast site. By having ""Rails"" and ""rSpec"" in big letters to the right of their logo, I know instantly what they sell.<p>I'm no designer, but that's what strikes me at first glance. What an excellent achievement for a fellow teenager though!<p>(One final tip, make your <title></title> have the words ""developer screencasts"" in it. It will help make sure people know what you are giving them.)",1248965845

Those people who have some sort of vision and are 'still' trying to change the world.  Most people are content with their jobs, the security it gives, and the money they take home.  Seth is speaking to the ones who want to work for something they believe in and actually do choose what company they send resumes to because it matters to them who and why they will lend their talents to.<p>This is where I'll sound like a Sethapologist:\nSome say anybody could have written this and that anybody could have ranted and been voted down here, but since it's Seth then the we pay attention.  But has anybody really 'ranted' with the kind of consistency and proven results like he has?  That's why people listen, and tho it's easy to dismiss what he says as 'just common sense', there will always be those who look to him and his words as inspiration and would have a seed of good management planted in them by it.  In that case, he's already done his job and achieved the goal of his post.  Something few of us can say we've done.<p>It's been more than a decade since I was in my 20's working a job because I needed the money yet still trying to hang on my ideals for dear life.

732317,comment,732136,732255,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Xanadu was ahead of its time in many ways, but the reason why the web took off the way it did I think has to do with the free and open nature of it.<p>The basic idea behind xanadu was that information could be re-cited as often as you wanted but the originator would get a slice of the cake.<p>The web is the opposite, it's a total free-for-all with the spammers and the parasites being on the same level as the originators of the content. Nelson saw it differently.<p>Early attempts at something like the web in Europe (minitel in France and videotext in the netherlands and germany) tried to charge 'by the page' for the content, but this seriously limited the amount of information available. Information providers could set a price on their information and the 'links' would display the price prior to activation. Billing was done through the telco.<p>If every web link came with a price attached I think it would have never gotten off the ground the way it did. Still, there are some good elements in that philosophy and I'm sure that in the long run 'for pay' links and some kind of citation mechanism will find their way back in to the web, simply because they are useful and because there is much demand for it (from the content providers side).<p>One potential way to realize this today is by setting up a gateway that deals with pay-per-view content where information providers could host their data and a plug-in based viewer (flash or something like it) that unlocks the content if the client has enough credits and confirms they want to see it.<p>I hope all of this makes sense :)",1248965135

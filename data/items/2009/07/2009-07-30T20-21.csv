733056,comment,732909,732909,0,0,bigbee,,,"My experience running such a consulting firm in the (distant) past was that the best way to stay profitable is to focus on WOM. Use any connections you have now to get some gigs, do above and beyond (regardless of what those early clients pay you) to make those customers extremely happy, and new project will keep coming your way.
The best thing about those referrals was that they were mostly serious - not just checking us to convince themselves that using some company in India is so much cheaper, and tended to close.
Other forms of promotion, PR mostly, resulted in lots of phones and meetings that usually led to nothing and proved to be a huge waste of time. Since in a consulting firm time = money in a the most acute sense, that hurt.<p>Oh, and regarding your website, you should improve the design. Don't think of it as a way to get new clients, that's unlikely. However, even if someone had heard about you through a referral, they check out your website first. It must look professional (i.e. business-like boring). If it doesn't, you lost them before they even talked to you. So this isn't a matter of getting clients, it's a matter of not losing them.",1248987516

733002,comment,732770,732933,0,0,bendotc,,,"Honestly, I don't really buy into the idea that getting your protein from a mix of beans and grains will somehow cause you to end up making up the cost difference in medical bills due to the amount of carbohydrates you're ingesting, given the huge number of people on this earth who do so and who appear to have perfectly fine results from this sort of diet. Just make sure you're getting some exercise (which you should be doing regardless of your diet).<p>That all having been said, tofu can be quite cost effective, low in carbs, and high in protein.  Of course, you might tell me there's aggression issues associated with tofu ingestion, and that it contains chemicals that mimic estrogen.  So, there's seitan, which is also high in protein, low in carbs, and can be made relatively cheaply from wheat gluten in bulk.  Of course, there are lots of people who decry wheat gluten as well, not to mention people who're legitimately allergic to it.<p>So that brings us to meat and fish. Meat often comes along with saturated fats and often raises your blood's LDL cholesterol levels, not to mention all the health, environmental, and ethical concerns of factory farming. You could take part in a co-op for your meat, but that is not going to enable you to eat for especially cheap.  Fish is generally better in the fat and cholesterol departments, but many carry with them mercury content that makes a lot of people nervous and the threat of overfishing. There are fish that avoid most of these concerns, such as tilapia, which fit most of the criteria, but is still not anywhere close to as price effective as dried beans.<p>If you don't want to get your protein from beans, that's fine.  I personally advocate people pay a little more and eat a healthy, varied diet, including many (or all) of the above-mentioned dangerous foods.

If you can build a client base from people that know you and trust you, that should serve as a source for continued work in the months to come.  The idea is to build a base of clients that are satisfied with your work, with the hope that they'll recommend you to people they come in contact with that may need similar services.  With every client you serve, think about how you can take the work you've done and re-apply that some effort towards future clients.  If you're doing any type of development, and you retain the right to reuse that code, it'll save you time and money down the road.<p>I'd also recommend speaking with an attorney, or finding a basic contract from an online resource that you can use for jobs you accept.<p>You may also want to speak to an accountant to make sure you handle the tax-aspect of a business correctly.

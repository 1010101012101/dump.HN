Establishing that it has the regularities of human language was a necessary first step.<p>Here's another interesting example.  The Luwian script's <i>directionality</i> couldn't be established.  It was not certain whether it was up-down, up-down or up-down, down-up or various possibilities.  This paper established using Expectation-Maximization the correct order of reading for the script:<p>Discovering the linear writing order of a two-dimensional ancient hieroglyphic script

Is C++ like Simula?<p>My statement was probably poorly phrased, but what I meant is that a modern C++ program is nothing like a modern Java program. The approach are radically different. I'm thinking about what the heavy usage of templates in C++ allows, what you can accomplish in terms of generic programming.<p>You can write in C++ like you would do in Java/C# but that would be pointless IMHO (complex hierarchy, virtual methods, etc. : exactly what I try to avoid).<p>It's like saying lizards an birds are similar because they share a common ancestor (dinosaurs).",1249465717

743105,comment,741518,742062,0,0,wooby,,,"There have existed, and do exist, cultures which value human lives lost in combat the same way we will view robots lost in combat.  In a sense, our enemy already thinks this way.  Each Jihadist's death, to them, is a victory in itself, and but one of many to come; a mark of progress in what is certainly the most glorious and successful guerilla campaign of all time.<p>I thought the author's arguments were heavily culturally-bound, and I don't think the use of robots in combat will change anything about the nature of war.  Killing can be automated; war, and winning wars, cannot.  There will always be repercussions the belligerent's society will be able to understand as ""loss.""  Our current definition is lost troops.  Our future enemies will figure it out if it changes, and make it as clear to us as possible in terms we can understand why we will not win.  Nowadays, their tools are insurgency and domestic terrorism.  Who knows what they will be in the future.<p>Preventing the start of future wars doesn't have anything, in my view, to do with stopping the Pentagon from further automating killing.  As long as we as a country feel the need to maintain a military, we must continue innovating with the tools and techniques of war.<p>A larger and scarier problem with our country, in my view, is our society's perspectives - on itself, on the world, on the meaning of life and death in general.  It is this perspective, and collective awareness, that will guide the way we use both our military and its robots in the future to solve problems and protect ourselves.  The average American has never served in the military, seen directly or even heard second-hand the nature of war or the military.  The average American hasn't even ever left the country, nor spoken another language.  How can our leaders, products of such a society, be expected to make decisions about the application of war?<p>It's a question that saddens me because I don't think there's an answer, and this post has turned into a rant.  Forgive me, back to coding!",1249465337

743102,comment,742906,742934,0,0,jimmybot,,,"Modern statistical machine translation works by training on large amounts of already translated data, called parallel corpora.  Monolingual data is helpful and can help you fix grammar, choose words that are more likely, but it won't work without that parallel corpora.  Basically, you need a Rosetta stone, and if you had that, the humans could slowly deduce all sorts of things from only a small amount of data that would probably be useless for an MT system.  Actually, scanning, or OCR, is a similar process--you train first on text that already has been properly transcribed, then you have a model that can be used to do OCR on new data.",1249465096

And I really don't think they failed the first time, they may have lost of to the PCs then but they didn't perish as a company.<p>Their philosophy has been to create a great product and sell it in one package. And it has worked pretty good for them with Mac line of products.<p>With the app store model they still get to control the applications that run on the iPhone. Which does give them the ability to not approve any application that would make the user experience with the device undesirable. This control over the app store is being used for tactical reasons by Apple. But obviously whether it was intended reason from the get go, I highly doubt that. Add to this who knows what legal agreements they are bound by with the Carrier. The carrier may say it wasn't us but when things go bad between them I am pretty certain there will be a few people in both these companies looking at those legal agreements.<p>Whether this is a good thing for developers, no. Whether it is good for Apple, may be in short term but probably not in long term. A more open policy with the approval process would be ideal.",1249464713

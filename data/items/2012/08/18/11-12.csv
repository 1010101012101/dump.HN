Instead of joining the chorus of rambling about the corruption of the evil Putin regime based on one out-of-context news story which is clearly being used for PR purposes, I just find it much more interesting to look at the larger narrative which might give me a more complete and more informed picture of the global political landscape. In the same vein I refuse to blindly focus on Obama's birth certificate or the issue of Romney's income taxes. No I am not being paid by the KGB to do this, as someone suggested. It's just critical thinking.<p>Edit: also by doing this I am not choosing to ignore corruption in Russia. It's clearly there as it is in any country, but there are more serious and more glaring examples of that corruption, albeit not as glamorous or news friendly and digestable.<p>Edit2: also you need to acquire some more information on that Omahr Khadr case.. it is definitely not as cut-and-dry as you've been led to believe.",1345290418

The crew were almost certainly alive (and if the cabin remained pressurized, could have been concious as well) for nearly 3 minutes until it hit the ocean at over 200 miles per hour.<p>At some point during those 3 minutes, I don't know if the SR-71 ejection seats used for the first few Shuttle launches could have improved their chances of survival, but it seems at least somewhat possible that it could have.  A parachute system for the crew cabin probably wouldn't work for the same reason the launch abort system on the proposed Ares was flawed (flying burning solid fuel going everywhere in the air is bad for parachutes)... nevertheless I think it is conceivable that you could build a Shuttle that would allow the crew to survive an accident like that.<p>But really, just stick the people on top.  It makes <i>way</i> more sense.

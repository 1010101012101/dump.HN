2030858,comment,2030188,2030247,0,0,revorad,,,"If not wrong, it's really simplistic (probably for the sake of this news piece). I just finished listening to the Facebook Effect by David Kirkpatrick. It is a really good account of Facebook's history. It shows just how uncertain things were in the beginning. There were loads of little decisions along the way which made Facebook what it is.<p>Zuckerberg, no doubt, turned out to be a visionary. But even he wasn't sure Facebook would last long, so he was hedging his bets with Wirehog.<p>Before Facebook, he was already experimenting with random hacks. When he saw Facebook absolutely exploded as soon as he put it out, he doubled down on it. Wouldn't any hacker do that?<p>I think Facebook's success lies in Zuck's ability to rally top people around him and to keep them focused on one vision, even when he's not clear what that vision is. Just ""something big"" seems to work until you figure out what it is.<p>This news story probably doesn't do justice to Ting's story, but did he really give up without even a hard fight? Who said becoming a billionaire was easy?<p>Edit: The coolest thing about listening to the book for me was that I found an old school friend of mine was a key early hire at Facebook. I hadn't spoken to her in years, but it was so cool to connect with her again. Of course, via Facebook.",1293004755

The main reason we sell to large enterprises an on premise solution is because they basically don´t trust us or our platform providers (aws, appengine) with their info.

2030846,story,,,1,0,socioclean,"Is Social Network Content the Credit Score of the future?",,"Almost all of us have one or more social networking accounts that we either are just members of because of peer pressure (even though all we do on it is go on other people’s profile to see their most updated pictures) or because we really do want to share our daily life stories with our friends. Facebook has already more than 500 million users and they still are relatively new in terms of monetizing the vast information. Considering the rate at which Facebook and Twitter are growing, there is no denying that the information about each person on these networks is going to become even more important than what it is today.
I came across an article yesterday that said if you want to become a cop, you have to make sure the content on your facebook and twitter account is clean. Recruiters sit with the candidate and ask them to log into their accounts and both the candidate and recruiter look through the content for any content that might hurt the candidate’s chances of becoming a cop. However ludicrous it might sound, it is the fact. Even if corporate recruiters don’t make it as explicit, they still try to dig up any kind of information that will aid them in making a hiring decision. Almost 85% of recruiters agree that online social reputation plays an important decision in the hiring process. With more and more people sharing information on Facebook and Twitter, the cleanliness of the content thats being posted will become really crucial. The saying goes “Never judge a book by its cover”, but in the digital age, the first thing that anyone does when they want to know more about a person is either google them or look up their facebook account to see what kind of a person he or she is. They might call it researching the person, but at the end of the day its judging who the person is with the information that he or she is sharing online.
Back to my original point of recruiters looking up social network content, I don’t think that day is far when going for a job interview, along with a resume one would also take a score of their online content that would prove they are worthy of the job. I feel social networking and its content scoring is going to be something similar to a credit score. You want to build it (since zero credit history is not good either) but you want to make sure that it is a good score since lot of things will be dependent upon it.",1293004128

Because people are less likely to comment at all.  Where there are few comments, they tend to be pretty good; where there are a <i>lot</i>, nobody reads them all, and you get the same as above.  And a bit of annoyance at having to scroll past things to get to the box (is this necessarily bad, though?)<p>New at bottom + box at bottom => fewer, threadier comments, varying quality.  People think more like forums.  You're also setting yourself up for ""fp!"", as those stay at the top forever.  Similarly, good comments only rarely get a chance to be read by <i>anyone</i>.<p>New at bottom + box at top => worst of all worlds.  Lots of comments, nobody reads, and people get frustrated because theirs never gets seen, leaving the world to the loud and annoyed and nobody else.<p>---<p>All that said: new at bottom + box at bottom anywhere you intend to have <i>communication</i>.  Twitter is both-top because it's not a bi-directional communication platform; it's a shoutbox.  The newest stuff matters, and yours is the newest.  Focus decreases as you scroll down, and as things get older.<p>Most chat systems are both-bottom, because you can read conversations like a book, and add yours logically close to where it will appear, and where the likely-most-relevant things are (newest in a thread = likely most relevant to your comment).  Focus likely increases as you go down, as things get more relevant; a downside to long-running threads if you have to reload the page, but no real problem if it updates in place.<p>Choice here can have a pretty profound impact on how people approach and use your system.

Until IRC clients learn to split channel contents by semantic context, they present the entire context (i.e. channel history) in chronological order for your perusal.<p>In something like email, messages tend to be somewhat interrelated, but because each message has links to its related messages, it's easy to break up a mailbox into threads. Generally, I would expect this kind of system to show the newest <i>thread</i> at the top, but the individual messages in that thread chronologically.<p>Since some email threads grow to enormous lengths, it's not always useful to have the first two thirds of the page occupied by messages posted a month ago, when all the activity is occurring in the leaves.

In fact, it is a regular alarm. I'm sure he simply imagined a vibrating wristband and so was disappointed with a regular alarm. Which is fine, but, vibration could also just as easily annoy others. It's personal preference and not poor design.<p>Finally, what irks me most is that he complains about the Wakemate setting off when you're already awake.

You disagree with the author, in short, about whether the result of shooting someone with any particular caliber of handgun is consistent and predictable.  The author felt strongly (based on the data he compiled) that it was a mistake to generalize about the effect of any type of gun or ammunition.  The author seemed to fear after examining his data that the mere act of stating his conclusions on the relative merits of different types of handguns and ammunition would reinforce a more orderly and predictable vision of the world than the data justified.  He said a lot of the appetite for research of the kind he was doing came from officers whose colleagues or subordinates were killed after placing a number of accurate shots on criminals who then lived to serve their sentences in comfort and good health, and he said he had no answers that would prevent that from happening again in the future, only recommendations that would make such incidents a little bit rarer.  He took great pains to undermine the idea that the characterization of the real-world performance of any firearm or ammunition load is anything more than statistical, confounded by many other variables.  He felt it was wrong to say about <i>any</i> kind of gun or ammunition that it penetrated well or consistently yielded a one-shot stop.  He could say that a certain caliber of gun seemed to yield one-hit stops slightly more often than others, but regardless of the caliber you will still see a certain number of four-or-five-hit non-stops followed by the suspect emptying his gun at the officer and then drawing a knife.  (I don't think the author put it exactly that way, but it's not snark or exaggeration on my part.)  And of course any caliber of gun will yield a one-hit or even zero-hit stop a certain amount of the time, and the best-penetrating round will occasionally fail to penetrate when it matters.<p>To be more concrete, in a gunfight between (say) a .45 and a .22 fired with equal accuracy, any trained person would want to be holding the .45, but the very clear-cut and undeniable advantage a .45 has over a .22 does not translate to a predictable outcome, any more than having two aces in hold 'em guarantees that you will have the best hand after the flop.  You can be 100% certain that a .45 is better than a .22 in that situation, but you can't predict with 100% confidence that the guy with the .45 is going to end up better off after the random confounding variables are figured in.  You would bet on the .45, of course, but sometimes you'd be wrong, even measured by the long-term effect of the wounds (which as I understand it is more predictable than the short-term effect of being shot.)<p>And of course, as I pointed out before, he had excellent reason and opportunity to cherry-pick a perfect example that would surprise his readers and undermine their appetite for generalizations (which appetite many of them doubtless bought his book to feed.)",1293001854

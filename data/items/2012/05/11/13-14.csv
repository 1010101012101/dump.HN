I have more than a few friends who are smart, and who are rock-solid performers, but who just don't have a knack for brainteasers. I would hope than an interviewer is able to suss this out in an interview, i.e., make the determination that a person is great in every aspect, would probably be a great fit, but just happens to suck at puzzle questions. Sadly, I'm sure it's more often the rule than the exception that an interviewer will reflexively pass on someone who flubs a puzzle.<p>And I agree with you that puzzle questions require flexibility not only on the part of the interviewee, but also on the part of the interviewer. If you're just tossing out questions based on a book of canned puzzles, don't be surprised when you get canned responses. The exercise becomes entirely meaningless when that happens, and there's really no use in proceeding with it if it does.",1336744655

All things being equal I would certainly bet on the person with some domain experience in engineering if engineering is a major component of the product. But I would much rather partner with somebody who can go out and make sales, define products, and hustle than somebody who knows how to code. Knowing how to code is a blip in time. It is not something that is necessary to build a successful business. Getting paying customers is and always will be. You can sit behind a computer screen drinking Mountain Dew all day and build the greatest software product in the world. Nobody will care if you don't know how to establish sales. Skilled coders are valuable for creating code, and that shouldn't be dismissed- it's a valuable skill. It's just a fairly common skill. That is, if you have the money you can always find a skilled coder. It is MUCH harder to find a person who can recognize customer needs, get a product created, and get sales, and sales are the lifeblood of a business. We've all seen the ""idea"" guys who say ""wouldn't it be cool if you had a site that did blah blah blah?"" Could you build that? Of course those guys are worthless.

But we aren't the ones that started it, it was the business types that wanted to turn us into stupid and replaceable assembly lines. Ask the developers in the games industry how they get treated. Well you get what you sow.<p>I actually see the reverse.

I appreciate good writing,  good action,  good direction,  and all of the other skills that go into TV.  I like specific shows,  and I like the ability that television has to tell huge stories that spread out over years.<p>Between work,  excercise,  and other forms of entertainment,  I don't have a lot of time to watch TV,  so my idea of a ""premium experience"" is being able to watch shows I really value when I can fit them into my life.<p>I've got no interest in broadcast TV or cable.  I remember doing a business trip that took me to NYC and LA and seeing both cities saturated with billboards for a new show.  I thought heck,  maybe I'll watch it.  Well,  I'm working like a dog in front of the computer and going to back-to-back meetings,  so the only time I've got to go for a run out in Hollywood is late in the evening,  so I miss the 10:00 start of the show and get back to my hotel at 10:10.<p>When I do watch cable,  I'm always shocked at how hard it can be to find something entertaining.  Sometimes it seems like nothing but Spongebob Square pants and reality shows about people who clip coupons and hang out at pawn shops.<p>There's no doubt at all that some great T.V. is being made today,  but the conventional distribution system mostly shows junk that is subsidized by a system that doesn't let people speak with their dollar.",1336741634

3958968,comment,3949635,3949635,3,0,bmelton,,,"In kind of reverse order:<p>- It is absolutely acceptable to use an existing blog engine or CMS to post with.  Many of the most respected developers use Wordpress, Blogger.com, Posterous or even just Google Plus to blog.  There is nothing wrong with this whatsoever.<p>- As for how important it is to have your own website / portfolio, it depends on wat you intend to do.  Career-wise, consider it a form of marketing.  If you want to run a startup, or be a freelance developer or designer, then having a blog / portfolio, with the potential to get leads, is absolutely critical.  If you want to work at a startup, showing knowledge on a subject is a good (though not guaranteed way) to get you to the front of the interview line faster, and can definitely get you hired over the next guy.  In simple terms, if you have a portfolio, you can <i>prove</i> that you can do the work, and that you <i>have</i> done the work.  The guy without the portfolio has to convince potential employers that he can.<p>If you're planning to do development, I would suggest putting your code on Github.  That's something you can point potential employers to to show that you've done programming.  Bear in mind that MANY applicants at programming jobs can't even complete FizzBuzz.  Just showing what you can do is more likely to get you where you want to be.  Also, Github is a great way to run into other people in the field.  People can see your code, be impressed by your code, or use your code.  Back before a lot of my old applications were purchased (long story) I had a company call me and offer me a job, out of the blue.  They were using my code in their products already, and figured since they were already using my code, they might as well hire me to make the changes they were hiring for.<p>The other caveat that I always make with Github is that your code doesn't have to be good.  It's usually never 'good enough'.  Unless you're specifically building a portfolio application (which there is nothing wrong with), it doesn't matter whether or not your code is 'clever' or not, so long as it builds / works / is useful.  If you have free time, it's great to go back and polish up old code for viewing, but 'works in progress' have no standard, in my opinion.  Working code is worth gold.<p>The last point I'll make that you didn't really ask about regards blogging.  For me, blogging is invaluable.  Even if you never <i>publish</i> your blog posts, the act of writing them is self-affirming.<p>It's so much easier to write a widget that fetches RSS feeds than it is to explain to a child how to write a widget that fetches RSS feeds.  The simple act of forming that explanation, even if only in your head, will cause you to be a better developer no matter what you do.  Also, if you do publish your code, it'll open it up to critique by your peers.  The biggest regret of my professional life is that I've spent too much time coding in isolation.  Coding in isolation is fine, but learning takes longer and you're more likely to develop bad habits that don't get fixed.  Show your code to your peers, to the world, and they'll give you tips back that make you better.<p>Sorry for the rant, but I hope it helps.",1336741516

There are many kinds of hiring screens, such as resume reviews for job experience, telephone interviews, in-person interviews, checks for academic credentials, and so on. There is much published study research on how job applicants perform after they are hired in a wide variety of occupations.<p>The overall summary of the industrial psychology research in reliable secondary sources is that two kinds of job screening procedures work reasonably well (but only about at the 0.5 level, standing alone). One is a general cognitive ability test (an IQ-like test, such as the Wonderlic personnel screening test). Another is a work-sample test, where the applicant does an actual task or group of tasks like what the applicant will do on the job if hired.  Each of these kinds of tests has about the same validity in screening applicants for jobs, with the general cognitive ability test better predicting success for applicants who will be trained into a new job. Neither is perfect (both operate at about 0.5 level in validation studies), but both are better than anything else that has been tested in rigorous research, across a wide variety of occupations. So if you are hiring for your company, it's a good idea to think about how to build a work-sample test into all of your hiring processes.<p>For legal reasons in the United States (the same consideration does not apply in other countries), it is difficult to give job applicants a straight-up IQ test (as was commonplace in my parents' generation) as a routine part of a hiring process. The Griggs v. Duke Power, 401 U.S. 424 (1971) case in the United States Supreme Court<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196978&q=Griggs+Duke+Power&hl=en&as_sdt=2,24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196...</a><p>held that cognitive ability tests used in hiring that could have a ""disparate impact"" on applicants of some protected classes must ""bear a demonstrable relationship to successful performance of the jobs for which it was used."" In other words, a company that wants to use a test like the Wonderlic, or like the SAT, or like the current WAIS or Stanford-Binet IQ tests, in a hiring process had best conduct a specific validation study of the test related to performance on the job in question. Some companies do the validation study, and use IQ-like tests in hiring. Other companies use IQ-like tests in hiring and hope that no one sues (which is not what I would advise any company). Note that a brain-teaser-type test used in a hiring process might be illegal if it can be shown to have disparate impact on some job applicants and is not supported by a validation study demonstrating that the test is related to successful performance on the job. Companies outside the United States are regulated by different laws.",1336741260

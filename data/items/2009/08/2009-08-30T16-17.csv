794653,comment,794245,794439,0,0,wmoxam,,,"Sounds like a good story, one that is often repeated in the US. Unfortunately it's not entirely true.<p>The facts:<p>* There are severe restrictions on prescription pharmaceutical advertising in Canada. For example, access to product information on pharmaceutical 'brochureware' sites is restricted by 'password' (I developed many of these sites for Pfizer years ago). Television advertising is limited to brand recognition type ads, the ad can't actually tell you what the drug does.<p>* The result of these restrictions has lead to far less marketing costs for pharmaceuticals.<p>* Medicare pharmaceutical guidelines (PMPRB) do impose price increase restrictions after they have been introduced to the market, and stated in it basic manner, will not endorse drugs that achieve the same effect as current drugs, yet cost more.<p>* Canadian gov't provides plenty of tax subsides for pharmaceutical  research<p>So yes, while there are pricing guidelines, it's not a one way street, there a bit of give and take here. In exchange for following pricing guidelines, companies receive generous tax credits for research.<p>The (intended) effect of pricing on advertising guidelines is designed to guide doctors to prescribe the best (from a cost/effectiveness standpoint) drug, rather than the 'new thing' or the one their patient is demanding due to seeing it advertised repeatedly on television.<p>This idea that the US is subsidizing the cost of drugs for other countries is silly. Drugs of US origin would not be sold abroad if it weren't profitable to do so. And given the 'free market' in pharmaceuticals in the US, wouldn't drugs be sold at the most profitable price anyways, regardless of market conditions elsewhere?",1251650547

I also think it will benefit the American born engineer.<p>The multi-nationals like IBM, Cisco, et al have already moved many of their engineering jobs overseas.  They also have the big bucks to pay American citizens to do those jobs.  The result is that smaller firms must rely on them for contractors and consultants which increases the price for these engineers <i>even more</i>.<p>The result is that engineers get paid more money to do local work through multinational corporations who farm them out to the smaller firms without the resources to find them or the deep pockets to give them permanent salaried jobs.<p>It also increases the prices for technology for local firms who can't afford custom systems or assistance developing their wares.<p>Either way, I'm not sure ""American"" companies are harmed, there is a division among the companies in America who are harmed and those who benefit. The large ones with offices overseas may very well benefit, relative to the harm done to smaller firms.<p>Also, American citizens will benefit through the availability of cheaper products produced in foreign lands, including software and hardware products.  Holding America up as a torch doesn't make much sense here because <i>all</i> of america won't experience the same effect.<p>Furthermore, there is a lot of criticism of the program because many economists, including Milton Friedman have called it a ""corporate subsidy"" and others argue that there in fact <i>are</i> enough americans to fill the technology positions.<p>Really, there is a lot of irrationality on both sides of the debate.  Arguments are made on ""right now"" rather than the future of America.  It is only the corporations who are saying that this issue has a deliterious effect on our future.

794644,comment,794245,794414,0,0,bokonist,,,"<i>To which I reply, American markets aren't free and never have been. Your ""free market capitalism"" is actually a series of interconnected oligopolies where a few powerful players control the market and use lobbying to errect barriers to free enterprise.</i><p>Economic sectors can fall in three general categories:<p>1) free market ( low or no regulation, freedom of contract, no legal barriers to entry, people voluntarily choose to buy their product, freedom to make profits, freedom to take losses) - Examples include: most manufacturing, retail, entertainment, electronics, furniture, cars, clothes, lasic surgery, trucking, shipping, tourism,  software<p>2) guild & cartel - businesses or associations recieve numerous special privileges and legal barriers to entry.  One example is the banking sector and the special access to the lender of last resort and to bailouts.  Another is the doctors associations and their monopoly right to dispense life saving pills.<p>3) socialized - a sector that is under operational management by the government.  For instance, the public education system or the park system.<p>The basic test for a free market is this:  If I wanted to start a business to compete with player X in this industry, would I be thwarted or hindered by the government in doing so?<p>America as whole has never been a perfect & absolute pure free market.  But certain sectors tend to pretty come close the ideal.  And its those sectors that tend to produce products of increasing quality and lower prices.  The sectors that seem to have endemic problems that end up being the subject of national debates, are all in categories 2 and 3 (finance, healthcare, and education).<p>Of course there is no easy way to go from 3) to 1) or 2) to 1).  A socialized system is a system of both price controls and restricted entry.  If you remove just the price controls, you have given the industry a license to rake the consumers over the coals.  Thus your path from 3) to 1) actually makes things worse.  This is the fatal law of many of the Cato libertarians.  At the end of the day, competency of the government is still important no matter what path is chosen.",1251649855

794640,comment,794524,794524,0,0,barrkel,,,"I'm running ZFS on OpenSolaris kernel (Nexenta, for GNU userland) for home storage, with my main zpool at 9.06TB spread over 8 hard drives, for almost 7TB worth of ZFS storage.<p>ZFS isn't quite what's billed to be, but it's (mostly) better than every other current choice. You can read the positives everywhere else, but let me point out some of the negatives.<p>* Space wastage: block sizes for files grow up to 128K, but they never shrink, and the last block in a file is currently always the same as the overall file block size. This means that files e.g. 129K in size will have 127K of wasted space on disk, and files that were once 128K and truncated back down to 1 byte will still have 128K block size. Depending on the kinds of files, you can see space wastage rates in the region of 25-45%. This isn't theoretical: I had to reduce max block size to 8K on one filesystem to avoid huge wastage.<p>* Streaming latency: as a media server, I often play movies from data stored on this server, but there's a problem somewhere in the stack (network, OS file cache, filesystem implementation). If I'm playing a movie or TV episode from a ripped DVD (i.e. VIDEO_TS directory) I can guarantee that there'll be at least one glitch in every 40 minutes of playback, where network transfer has dropped to zero for 3 or 4 seconds.<p>* Device removal: you can add more storage to a ZFS pool, and one can replace any given device with a drive equal or larger in size, but it's not possible to remove a device. If you start out with 8 disks, you're stuck with 8 disks unless you want to backup and restore the entire FS - but at least FS streaming is easy with e.g. zfs send <snapshot> | ssh <remote> zfs receive <filesystem>.<p>* Fragmentation: there is no defragmentation solution currently. Sure, people say it's ""not an issue"", that ""ZFS is not pathalogical"", but the same was said about NTFS, and NTFS fragments like crazy when small incremental writes are used. ZFS performance is known to fall off a cliff (e.g. less than 1% of prior perf) as you approach capacity (symptomatic of fragmented free space) and, more importantly, <i>stay</i> abysmal until you back off quite a bit and preferably drop a whole file system or two. Recommendation is to stay under 80%, which isn't very full.<p>* Performance: performance is a bit of a red herring; you can make ZFS as fast as you want by adding mirroring and striping. The more interesting case is when you don't have mirrors and stripes out the wazoo, and are relying on RAIDZ or RAIDZ2, and here the performance depends on access patterns. The way the parity and checksumming works, you need to burn a lot of cache to get decent small random read/write performance, because entire blocks need to get read and written even for small updates. So performance looks great for a while, then falls off.<p>I still think ZFS is one of the best choices for this kind of application - the software RAID, multiple-volume handling is terrific - but it's far from the last word, and not 100% baked (needs defragmentation and data recovery tool ecosystem). BTRFS looks like it could be a very worthy contender, but from what I've read, I haven't seen that it values a storage-unit/pool/filesystem stack, where storage-unit can be a disk, a file or a partition, and still seems stuck on the old device/filesystem approach.",1251649717

Eventually you build up a standard list of authors that you want to find papers citing (yes, I know, this can be overly narrow, but it's effective).<p>- As mentioned elsewhere, use Citeseer.<p>- Its much easier to navigate a reference graph than to search cold.  So find papers you think are <i>excellent</i>, and then serach everyone who cites them, all other work by referenced and citing authors, and so on.<p>- Use arXiv.  You can set up RSS feeds for certain keywords, and search them. This is low-SNR but yields some gems.<p>- Most importantly: Don't search! Ask other people what's worth reading and what's good, in your group/lab/friends.",1251648170

I am sure you can claim to have learnt a lot of allied ""subjects"" during your education including teamwork, competing, leadership, analytical thinking, synthesis of data, risk taking (maybe) etc. But I do agree that education (whether American or Asian) should give students room to develop the above while learning core subjects for it to be holistic.  It should not purely rely on it being rote based.",1251648074

Will the article on Theodore Roosevelt have to be interrupted by a pro-con debate on whether Theodore Roosevelt was actually a woman, if someone decides to suggest that he was? How many other crazy theories can we raise before the article becomes totally unreadable?",1251648054

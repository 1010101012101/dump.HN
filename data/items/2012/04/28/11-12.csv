Most people know how to use bash and wouldn't notice any difference by switching (except for a possible unnecessary learning curve).<p>Lets turn it around. Assuming (and a big assumption) that zsh is more powerful, why does this matter to someone who probably spends most of their time at a terminal thinking and puts anything half way repetitive into a script? Its like telling a carpenter than a brand X chisel is more powerful than a brand Y chisel.<p>Show me how a skilled zsh user is 'more powerful' than a skilled bash user at anything that matters.

You're not in jail in a traditional sense, but there are a laundry list of bad things that will happen, making it seem like you are. I'm talking things like wage garnishment and draining bank accounts. It's difficult to live a life based on cash (as in green paper), so at some point, the banks will catch up with you and drain your accounts. It's next to impossible to lead a normal life when you can't even save up enough money to pay cash for a $5000 car. The impact of wage garnishment on employment are significant as well. How motivated would you feel to show up to work, knowing that you'll never see the majority of your wages. This drives a lot of people to do stupid things like commit fraud, which can result in jail time if you repeatedly break the law.<p>You literally end up on the run from your debt.

You’re looking at it as a hardware person in a fragmented world. You’re looking at it as a hardware manufacturer that doesn’t really know much about software, who doesn’t think about an integrated product but assumes the software will somehow take care of itself. And you’re sitting around saying, well, how can we make this cheaper? Well, we can put a smaller screen on it, and a slower processor, and less memory, and you assume that the software will somehow just come alive on this product that you’re dreaming up, but it won’t. Because these app developers have taken advantage of the products that came before, with faster processors, with larger screens, with more capabilities that they can take advantage of to make better apps for customers. And they’re not… it’s a hard one, because it throws you right back into the beginning of that chicken-and-egg problem again, to change all the assumptions on these developers. Most of them will not follow you. Most of them will say, “I’m sorry, but I’m not going to write down a watered-down version of my app just because you’ve got this phone that you can sell for $50 less, and you’re begging me to write software for it.”<<<p><a href=""http://www.macworld.com/article/154980/2010/10/jobs_transcript.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macworld.com/article/154980/2010/10/jobs_transcri...</a>",1287542695

1809736,comment,1806911,1808202,0,0,gaelian,,,"My two cents would be that it's almost always somewhere in between the two extremes you describe.<p>Certainly having experience with OO in one language will be an advantage when it comes to picking up another OO language but yeah, you're not 100% there. I would posit that you're more than 50% there, though (with this particular example). Understanding the OO concept is more important than the syntax.<p>You know what I find onerous when I think about learning a new language? It's not so much picking up the new syntax because a lot of the time I find that I can do that pretty quickly (at least if the paradigm between old and new language is not too disparate). It's picking up the ecosystem around the language:<p>How do I deploy an application written in language X?\nHow do I package code written in language X (e.g. Ruby gems, Python eggs or whatever)?\nWhich unit testing frameworks do I learn?\nWhat IDEs or text editors are usually used with language X?\nDocumentation conventions and related software (e.g. rdoc)?\nWhat community resources are valuable, trustworthy and stable? etc.<p>When I first started learning Ruby (along with Rails, some years ago now) my web development experience mostly consisted of LAMP and ASP.Net. Deploying Rails apps seemed like such a massive hassle compared to PHP. Part of this was that Ruby as a web dev language was much newer than PHP and was still settling in, parts of it really were a hassle. But I came to realise that a big reason for the difference was that the two communities were conceptually coming at the issue of deployment from very different perspectives and a lot of the differences I was seeing were no accident, and not so difficult to grok when you understand the motivation behind them.<p>A lot of non-programmers don't get that there is usually a fair amount of transferable knowledge when it comes to picking up a new language that utilises similar concepts to one you already know. But I can also understand that some (probably most) employers want their staff to ""hit the ground running"" and may be looking for people with a very specific skill set.<p>Putting myself in the position of an employer and knowing what I do, I'd rather hire Person A that's obviously enthusiastic about learning new stuff, who's maybe contributed to something open source that can be reviewed, and who surely has some background knowledge that they can build on but who may not necessarily have language X listed on their resume, over Person B who does have language X on his resume but that's all they've really got. It would be good if more recruitment firms and HR departments started to realise that having the right acronym/keyword listed on your resume doesn't actually mean much on its own.",1287542623

1809727,comment,1809412,1809470,0,0,jseliger,,,"A nitpick: People in English departments would probably call this a ""rhetorical analysis,"" since ""literary analysis"" usually refers to fiction.<p>I would say that Graham tends to have the modernist tendency to cut anything superfluous; to quote Milan Kundera in _Encounter_, ""Almost all great modern artists mean to do away with 'filler,' do away with whatever comes from habit, whatever keeps them from getting directly and exclusively at the essential (the essential: the thing the artist himself, and only he, is able to say)."" Kundera, like Graham, is very good at doing this in his nonfiction; his essays on the novel contain more in 200 broadly spaced pages than most tomes about literary theory that I've read.<p>One other thing:  is very, very good at not repeating himself and not having ideas with an extreme amount of overlap. I think that's one reason he tends to say things like, ""I'm not saying X"" as clarification -- to avoid misreadings that might result from his terseness.<p>This tendency towards minimalism, by the way, is one of the same things that John Sculley talks about Steve Jobs having in terms of industrial design: <a href=""http://www.cultofmac.com/john-sculley-on-steve-jobs-the-full-interview-transcript/63295"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cultofmac.com/john-sculley-on-steve-jobs-the-full...</a> . Graham does it in nonfiction writing. Elmore Leonard does it in fiction; he's incredibly skilled at compacting a lot of action into a very small space. If you're looking for fiction that's as ""dense"" (for lack of a better term) as nonfiction, try Leonard. His subject—capers of a vaguely criminal and usually underworld nature—might not appeal to you, but the man has style.<p>In addition, Graham is very good at using metaphors and comparisons with history. There isn't really a good way to analyze metaphor that I know of. Some of the better attempts include Lakoff and Johnson's _Metaphors We Live By_ and Steven Pinker's _The Stuff of Thought_. But, as far as I know, no one has a complete theory of why we think associatively and metaphorically. Good writers, however, will tend to exploit the tendency to view one thing in term of another.<p>The problem with these kinds of generalizations is that they're very hard to make concrete. You might notice that I don't cite a lot of examples from Graham's writing because it''s harder to prove the absence of perceived filler than it is to identify filler when you see it.",1287542282

1809724,comment,1808925,1808925,0,0,JimmyL,,,"For me, it depends on what I'm trying to accomplish with the communications hit, as both methods have their pluses and minuses.<p>I find email is much better if I have a complex/multi-step idea that I'm trying to convey. The act of writing it out allows me more time to concentrate on a clear way to get the point across, gives me time to revise the communication to make sure I got it right, and allowed the receiver to re-read parts to make sure they have understood the idea properly. It also (obviously) makes it possible to include charts, numbers, maps, pictures - really any multimedia product that helps explain your point.<p>Email is also clearly better for CYA purposes/situations where you need to have an unambiguous and easily-transferable record of who made what decision. Sure, you could record and then save the phone conversation - but that's pretty awkward.<p>Phone conversations, on the other hand, I find are much better for information acquisition. They allow you to try and establish a rapport/make small talk with the person you're talking to, which often leads to information you wouldn't get otherwise. I can't count the number of times that a digression or a little small-talk on the phone has given me some information that I wouldn't have gotten if I'd simply sent an email listing the facts I needed to know. The small ""relationship"" that you can build through a few phone calls also tends to come in handy later if and when you meet the person in-the-flesh, moreso I find than n email conversation can.<p>Yes, note-taking sucks - but I've gotten into the routine of speaking to someone on the phone, and then while on the phone with them asking for things to be emailed to me (generally the type of things I'm after they have on their computer anyways).<p>The other issue, of course, is timing. Even when you're in a situation where you know the people you're communicating with are at their computers, I find it's almost always faster to call someone to get an answer to a question, as opposed to emailing them. This, in turn, influences the way I communicate with them. If the issue isn't that pressing, I'll often email - it allows the recipient to deal with it at their leisure, which I respect as much as I can. If I need the information reasonably soon, I'll send a follow-up email as a reminder, to bring the issue back to the top of their mental/actual inbox and remind them that I'm waiting for this. But if it's urgent, I'm going to end up ignoring the scheduling-habits of the person I'm dealing with and will pick up the phone. I may be interrupting whomever I'm calling, but they'll have had plenty of time to respond at their leisure by that point, and their time is up.<p>Bottom line, for me, is that it depends. What's the interaction for? Who's it with? What's our relationship? And when do I need that information?",1287542218

More interesting is that the unstated premise for these link-bait titles (aka great headlines) is ""If only they had listened to Mandelbrot, we could have avoided all these problems.""<p>It is nearly absurd on the face of it, but worth a comment. Like Louis Bachelier's description of stochastic processes in 1900, mathematicians like Mandelbrot have been inspired by financial time series to develop formal <i>descriptions</i> of the phenomena. Sometimes, this leads to a marginally deeper understanding of the object of study.<p>Regardless, mathematicians and other scientists have little interest in developing <i>prescriptions</i> that would help control or reduce volatility. Most observers seem to think that the amount of financial volatility is way too high in comparison to the underlying economic realities. A few, like Fisher Black, have had the opposite opinion and suggested that the prospects of the underlying economy (including human capital) are actually hugely volatile. Virtually all take the structure of markets as a given and assume they are low-friction and generally structured well.<p>My own opinion is that volatility is mainly a function of information starvation in the market. Just look at the poor quality of financial accounting, auditing, and the cherished secrecy of large risky positions and you can see possible areas to unlock information flow that would allow markets to do a better job of tracking ""true"" value and ignoring chaff generated by the act of trading.",1287541657

""Because the consciousness that moves us is making a world.""<p>A simple example to demonstrate that it is possible to predict things about this society to a nontrivial degree, is the products and activities of Apple Inc. They have great marketing foresight. But besides that, it sounds like they were building mobile devices for a long time before the touch-based smartphone market really took off in the last few years, enough to get it right. I'm not an Apple employee but I've been using an apple for ages. It seems to me like the people at the group had to very carefully understand what kind of questions there are in building something like that and making it work best. Granted, Apple has lots of problems, but what I'm trying to point out here is that by funding and working on the problems in order to get it right, is usually going to result in the best products which if able to be made available widely enough will become very popular for a period of time. As a result, objective-C has come into use much more, and jobs were opened.<p>The question of how to see and predict the course of the world lies in understanding what exists in front of us.<p>Products that were developed by copying others or with ignorance of the problems in the matter, will eventually exhaust themselves. On the other hand, products from a company that had see what exists in their life and generates work matching what they see in problems, assuming they are adept at protecting themselves in business, will be able to be more successful. Even people who don't have any university education can be successful through their knowledge of what is. So we have to be able to comprehend human consciousness in order to understand how an economy will move. Luckily, to understand consciousness is simple, if you are really willing to know. Consciousness is changed  for better or worse by what happened to it.<p>In this society where people have undertaken large-scale industrial production on Earth, people in presently affluent circumstances can afford to use cell phones more profitably than without them. But in a different society, the problem that makes the economy exist may be different but the principle through which it exists remains the same. Things are either getting better or worse through what is in the principle.<p>This principle isn't precisely comprehended in those economists' education and that results in lots of thinking that turn out to be misguided. But things in reality are very simple. It's just that we need to search what kind of problems we have inside of us in order to know what they are like.",1287541475

Apple doesn't advertise anything other than their own branding and experience with their laptops and desktops, so their message of integrated, user-friendly, clean experience when using their software on their hardware stands, even though it's not locked down.<p>This is a red herring anyway.  I don't believe I'd be able to list anything other than Apple as an example of something integrated, user-friendly, clean experience without someone pointing out that whatever it is isn't as good as a random Apple product and thus doesn't qualify as a counterexample.  It's really easy for someone to say ""I don't think X provides an experience on par with Apple products, even though it isn't ruthlessly controlled"" for any X.",1287540301

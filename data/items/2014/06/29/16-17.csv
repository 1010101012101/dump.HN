The DOM of its era.<p>The shell, which happens to typically <i>live in</i> the terminal, has three things going for it that GUI interfaces frequently lack.<p>First, composability and automation: any action you can fire off from the shell, you can fire off from a shell <i>script</i>.  Any data you&#x27;re given by a utility, you can operate on and send to any other utility.  Any data you&#x27;re asked to provide can come from anywhere.<p>Second, narrative structure with history and a sense of place.  &quot;I did X, then I did Y, so now I need to Z... wait, what did X say?&quot; is a natural mode of interaction convenient to many sorts of tasks.<p>Third, extensibility.  Write any new utility (whether <i>in</i> the shell or in any language other you choose) and it is quickly a first class piece of your toolset.  (This is the most common of the three to find in GUI land, though it often has limitations).",1404061047

Also, the asyncio approach makes it very clear when you have released the &quot;lock&quot; on your state--it happens every time you yield from your coroutine.

7961632,comment,7960832,7961165,2,0,loup-vaillant,,,"I have an easy counter to Pacabel&#x27;s argument: Apple used to use PowerPC.  Now they&#x27;re on X86.  People used to use 16bits, then 32bits CPUs.  Now they use 64bits CPUs.  Operating systems have followed, and soon, programs will as well.<p>My point is, if you can abstract the underlying architecture, you can replace it. It&#x27;s difficult because most complex abstractions leak, but it has been done in the past.  That Javascript virtual machine written in C++ could be re-written in Rust.<p>So, even if displacement means &quot;you are not even allowed to use C/C++ as a target language&quot;, and &quot;you are not even allowed to use OS services written in C/C++&quot;, we can still &quot;displace&quot; C and C++.  It won&#x27;t happen any time soon however.  I believe we need to wait for something like mainstream FPGAs.<p>The problem with current processors and C/C++ is, they tend to be optimized for each other.  If instead we had something like an FPGA running at desktop speed, programs would be compiled to logic gates instead of being compiled to assembly.  <i>This</i> would dig a grave for C++.",1404060725

This problem also occurs in physics; using the standard approximation of gravity of 32 feet per second per second, the extra time required to fall 9 feet instead of 4 feet is exactly 1/4 second. Should you actually try the experiment, you&#x27;ll quickly notice that your measured time varies from attempt to attempt. There is an office of the government which (among other duties) measures the weight of a coin (the same physical coin) every day, and records the result. Some days are anomalous. There&#x27;s variation every day.<p>What larger N does is enable you to see past the noise. With a large sample, the effect of the <i>noise</i> in your measurements diminishes to zero, letting you estimate the <i>effect</i> you&#x27;re looking for more accurately. So over 200,000 apple drops, I should see an <i>average</i> fall time discrepancy very close to 0.25 seconds; whereas with 2 apple drops, I might for whatever reason measure the time discrepancy as 2/3 second. The 0.7 seconds estimate is way off because of small N.<p>If, as you work with larger and larger sample sizes, the effect you&#x27;re measuring recedes steadily to zero, the obvious conclusion is that it&#x27;s all noise.<p>However! We started this by talking about a different thing entirely. You say this:<p>> There&#x27;s an effect, that we&#x27;re very confident is real, works in both directions and has real world implications.<p>This study has immense statistical power and a minuscule effect size.

A very small effect size means that the real-world implications are likewise very small.<p>As a toy example, suppose I do a study finding that feeding children between the ages of 4 and 7 meat with bones in it vs meat without bones increases their height as adults by three feet (p < 0.9).

7961474,comment,7959519,7959519,1,0,todd8,,,"In ECB mode, a block cipher (like AES) is used to encipher/decipher each block (of say 128 bits) with the cipher key independently of all other blocks.  This means that two equal ciphertext blocks, say block 23 and block 61, have equal corresponding plaintext blocks so we can surmise that plaintext blocks 23 and 61 are identical.  This weakness precludes using simple ECB mode in most cryptographic situations.  It is too easy to exploit this property of ECB mode with replay or reordering attacks because the encrypted blocks can be rearranged and still remain valid.<p>The talk that you reference implys that is it possible to progressively decrypt ECB encoded data by progressively decrypting one byte at a time.  I don&#x27;t see how this makes any sense in the way suggested in that video, and I am guessing that this is why you are wondering how this type of attack would be applied in practice.  First note that changing even one bit of the plaintext block will on average change half of the bits in the resulting ciphertext when using a strong block cipher like AES.  Mr. Ptacek suggests using a chosen plaintext attack to build up a dictionary of ciphertext to plaintext such as<p><pre><code>   Plaintext           Ciphertext (in hexidecimal)\n   ----------------    --------------------------------\n   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA    219d992d9f5ae84d29ffd4dfbeaf1f7f\n   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB    a20400dbb98b6da0ac0178d71204460d\n   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC    cd20f8731ccf8e6643b287aadaf84f26\n   ...                 ...\n</code></pre>\nNow, whenever we see a block containing cd20f8731ccf8e6643b287aadaf84f26 we know that it&#x27;s plaintext\ntranslation is AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC. But this doesn&#x27;t help us. Changing only the last character or even bit of the plaintext is no different than changing the first of 12th bit, the result is a new completely cryptographically random result in the ciphertext.  We can&#x27;t progressivly attack the plaintext one character at a time as suggested by the video.<p>We can continue to fill in the dictionary by just submitting chosen plaintext to the system and recording the results. The problem with this approach is that to be useful this dictionary will contain many many entries and will change completely for each different key.  For arbitrary plaintext, the dictionary will contain 2^64 entries or worse 2^128 or 2^256 entries depending on the block size of the underlying cipher.<p>All of this doesn&#x27;t mean that ECB mode is safe against attacks, just that the attack as described by the video using pipe characters, etc. doesn&#x27;t make sense.  However, there are times where we can brute force ECB mode with a chosen plaintext attack.  For example, if we already know that a block of important plaintext starts with the eleven characters &quot;Password = &quot; this leaves only 5 bytes in the block to be guessed.  Now we can run through all 5 character values and use this.  It may only reveal the first five characters of a password in this case, but that is an important vulnerability.<p>I believe that the section of this video to which you refer is confusing because Mr. Ptacek is attempting to present a simple introduction to an important cryptographic attack against another mode of using block ciphers.  This attack is known as the <i>padding oracle attack</i>. The CBC mode (cipher block chaining) eliminates the weaknesses I&#x27;ve described above for ECB mode, but it has an important vulnerability of its own which makes use of a padding error oracle. I won&#x27;t attempt to describe it here, it requires quite a bit of explanation, but by using this attack, a system that returns detectable errors when there is a block padding error, <i>can</i> be attacked and almost an entire message can be decrypted <i>one byte at a time</i> as Mr. Ptacek suggests.  It&#x27;s just all more complex and applies only to the CBC mode not the ECB mode.<p>Unfortunately, on the web, there is a lot of hard to understand information on such cryptographic attacks.  I find many blog posts are by those describing systems that they don&#x27;t fully understand and papers written by researchers that do understand the attack but make heavy use of mathematical notation and describe the attacks in their full generality.  There are few resources with easy to understand diagrams and clear descriptions.  For this particular padding attack on ECB mode I suggest: <a href=""http://robertheaton.com/2013/07/29/padding-oracle-attack/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robertheaton.com/2013/07/29/padding-oracle-attack/</a>",1404057669

There are other startups coming in the scene addressing this issue of ""privacy"" and ""open source"" etc... With time Google and Microsoft will follow as well as VCs looking for potential candidates... MySpace could have re-designed their interface and added relevant features to stay competitive rather than switching their focus which was their main down turn. Ex. Microsoft buys yahoo to compete with google... no success.. Microsoft creates bing (sort of like a copy of google) and takes a good share of the market.<p>Facebook ""basically"" gave users what myspace and friendster had + some more in a very nice and easy to use format (even though both companies had largely taken over the market based on our expectations at the time - p.s. expectations change). Is that what a startup can do in this area to potentially ""viral"" and gain AT THE LEAST 100,000 members? Ex. StudioVZ, Chinese facebook copy etc...<p>Expectations of a market take over can now be defined as 500 mill members and in 2004 and on myspace was considered at the top of its game etc... you guys probably see what im getting at. But 2004 and now is a huge difference with access to computers, technology and cell phones being extremely convenient so is 500 mill a REALLY BIG NUMBER or Can it get even BIGGER in the future?",1301190830

2373862,comment,2373738,2373738,8,0,TheAmazingIdiot,,,"Adams has a few good points about this. I'm not saying that it's completely right, but some ideas are.<p>1. In Family Court, the man is seen as the bad one. Unless the woman is a baby-eater or something disgusting, she will get custody, with the man getting every other weekend or some such. He will also be charged to pay up to half his income for the ""child"",. And there is usually little or no checks to make sure it goes to the child.<p>2. In terms of parental and mother rights: A woman has a multitude of techniques in which to evade or eliminate pregnancy. These techniques can include up to abortion (this is NOT an abortion debate). After the child is born, the woman can also leave the child(ren) at a multitude of safe ""drop points"" in which the child is considered abandoned without criminal charge. The man, has very little recourse over children, even up to the woman having birth. There is no way for a man to give up parental rights and also not pay child support. The woman can do this at any time.<p>3. Women's pay is not in parity with men's pay of an equal job with equal skills. This is correct. The ""solution"" to this is to lower men's pay to that of women. And in cases which the woman sues, (SCOTUS case  <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/05/29/340479/-SCOTUS:-Women-In-Workplace-Screwed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/05/29/340479/-SCOTUS:-Wom...</a>) the woman is still screwed.

2373800,comment,2373490,2373490,46,0,rayiner,,,"The points about LLVM being designed for ""static C-like languages"" isn't totally on-point. There as an impedance mismatch between Python and LLVM, but it's less about dynamic versus static than it is about the nature of the stack frame.<p>In LLVM, most optimizations operate on SSA values (the Value class in the LLVM IR). There is some support for CSE-ing loads, etc, but the effectiveness of that depends heavily on your alias information. So to get good optimization out of LLVM, you've got to represent things as Value's.<p>This is hard to do in Python. Python's lexical scoping semantics are a little bit wonky and there are lots of scenarios in which the thread's stack frame is reified as an object. So without some heavy analysis, you end up keeping your local variables in an activation frame object on the heap, and at that point you're toast. The local variables themselves won't be represented as SSA Value's, and most of the LLVM optimizations won't do anything with them.<p>This is not a ""dynamic language"" thing per se. Lisp, which is also a dynamic language, actually maps quite cleanly to LLVM. Every binding introduced by LET is already in SSA form unless it is either closed-over, assigned-to, or both.<p>1) If the value is just closed-over, you demote it to the function's environment and replace uses of the variable with a load from the environment vector.<p>2) If the value is just assigned-to, you just demote it to a stack slot via ALLOCA and LLVM's mem2reg pass will take care of re-promoting it to a Value. This latter technique is exactly what Clang does for all C local variables, so LLVM is highly-tuned for handling this scenario. In C, variables that have their address taken cannot be promoted, but this cannot happen in Lisp so every assigned-to value demoted to an ALLOCA should be promotable.<p>3) If a value is both assigned-to and closed over, you demote it to a heap-allocated box and replace all uses with heap references.<p>After this transformation, nearly every Lisp variable is an SSA Value, and the optimizers can work with them. Even if you use function calls to do generic arithmetic, etc, LLVM will happily CSE them for you as long as you mark those functions as readnone (ie: pure).<p>Now, there are some things LLVM won't do for you. It can't const-propagate generic arithmetic because it does't know the semantics. It can't do reassociation, etc, because you're not using the ADD/SUB, etc instructions. I don't see anything that would prevent you from doing it yourself in a custom pass, however.<p>In short, the criticism isn't so much that LLVM has an impedance mismatch with dynamic languages as it is that it only handles the bottom of the optimization stack. You still need to do the high-level language-specific optimizations before handing things to LLVM.",1301189403

One thing that would be cool is to add collapsible sections where someone lists an experience (like welding) and if you open the section it tells much more about this experience (talking at length about the welding job for example).  That way people could go over it quickly and if interested read more.<p>I'd make the link to the example page a little more obvious, I didn't intuitively think I could click on the image for whatever reason.",1301188070

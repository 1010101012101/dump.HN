8751931,comment,8750559,8751336,0,0,_delirium,,,"Bit of an aside, but the &quot;horizontal&quot; propagation of laws from state to state has some structural reasons that it favors certain kinds of laws more than others. Mostly the large role of the Uniform Law Commission (ULC), which draws up model laws and organizes campaigns for them to be passed: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Law_Commission"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Law_Commission</a>. It has no formal power, but it has a well-established set of supporters, working relationships with legislators, staff to do the actual drafting work who are familiar with the law of all 50 states, etc.<p>The ULC in principle is interested in a lot of areas of harmonization of what they consider well-written laws. But its biggest political support is from multi-state companies that want a uniform commercial operating environment, so it has been mostly successful there, via the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), a set of model regulations for commerce. Businesses can get some of what they want in this respect more directly, by lobbying the federal government to directly pass uniform national laws, enforced via federal preemption. But it&#x27;s possible to achieve a more comprehensive degree of uniformity, avoiding constitutional issues with federalism, by going the UCC route. It formally preserves federalism (each state voluntarily enacts the UCC), while still producing the desired outcome due to the heavy pressure states feel to conform to the UCC, lest they be perceived as &quot;bad for business&quot; (every state has passed it, though in a few cases with modifications).<p>The other area they&#x27;ve been somewhat successful in is family law, due to widespread concern over problems that arise in cross-state divorce and child-custody proceedings if the states have very different family-law regimes. So many states are willing, absent some strong lobby in another direction, to sign on to a &quot;national best practice&quot; in that area.",1418651878

8751890,comment,8750354,8751470,0,0,shriramkmurthi,,,"SICP and HtDP are two very different books that have the unfortunate feature of using somewhat similar languages (which are syntactically very similar, hence causing the confusion).<p>I was recently re-reading SICP, and was amazed by how cleverly structured it is. It somehow goes for an entire fifth of a book without any data structure at all. It retrospect, I consider it something of a virtuoso achievement to have pulled that off while writing a book that is utterly compelling on every page. However, the only way it can achieve that is by focusing _entirely_ on what we call &quot;domain knowledge&quot;. As the kind of person who has always loved the play of numbers, I was immersed fully and barely noticed what was happening when I read it as a student. To most students, however, this material is both uninteresting and difficult, and difficult material that isn&#x27;t even relevant to the domain is especially uncompellling.<p>Of course, diving into data early means you need a lot more help structuring your programs. HtDP focuses precisely on that problem, _using_ the data to drive the structure (inspired by earlier efforts such as The Little Lisper). And this highlights exactly how very different the two books are. It is much like the comment about the US and UK: &quot;two countries separated by a common language&quot;. The coincidence of using (almost) the same language in both books has, sadly, created a great deal of confusion on this point.",1418651409

The labor exploitation hypothesis suggests that Uber not only hopes to avoid paying higher costs that might be needed to attract drivers away from competing companies, but hopes to actually achieve driver costs lower than what existing companies face, by exploiting significant information dissymmetries. One key is Uber’s “independent contractor” approach, whereby those drivers provide the vehicle, vehicle maintenance and liability insurance. As mentioned earlier, traditional business logic suggests that this approach could not work because existing companies could always get much better rates than individuals acting in isolation. In these situations Uber has shifted the full vehicle capital risk (normally borne by a taxi company) to the driver; this allows Uber to grow without raising much capital, but there is no evidence that drivers are being compensated for their (collectively) large capital contribution, or the risk that Uber exercises it rights to suddenly terminate the contract of the person who had purchased a vehicle on its behalf. Similarly, the typical taxi/limo driver may not understand the true maintenance/depreciation costs of intensive commercial use as well as professional fleet managers, and multiple reports indicate Uber drivers do not always understand the requirement to purchase commercial insurance with significantly greater liability coverage than their personal policies (carrying paying passengers would invalidate their personal policies and violate laws in most cities).",1418651352

I know that you can do everything in unsafe, but as soon as I step into that mode I&#x27;m getting the feeling that it might end up in the same level as C++ or probably even more complicated.<p>It probably shouldn&#x27;t have to do with dealing explicitly with mutexes. If you have to I think that things like std::sync::Mutex are no good solutions because they are  not really general purpose. If you really deal with low-level multithreading problems you often have multiple mutexes that might need to be locked in a special order and the mutexes are normally part of a data structure and do not own the data.<p>But multithreading is only a part of the whole problem. The other one is achieving easy-to-use and safe concurrency in a single thread (like Javascript APIs).",1418649819

Ie legalize weed US nationwide, and many prisons (let&#x27;s not forget many are private owned by investors, who want only one thign - maximize their profits by having as many inmates as possible), DEA loses maybe 90% of the success claims they have, and maybe local police can have more time dealing with serious issues.
For conservative politicians, its political ammo par exellence, since if they will go hardline on drugs, there are very few risks to their career, and they can always claim all the usual stuff (drugs are destroying families and young people, we care about them etc... ever heard that?). Ask yourself - what can a politician gain vs lose bybeing pro-weed in US?<p>Too lazy to look it up, but if I remember correctly that one of DEA chiefs was also head of some UN panel on drugs, which then enforce rules for all UN member states (read whole world maybe except North Korea).

One real example - weed & hashish have thousand years of history in hindu culture (look up shiva day when almost all india is high), yet they had to ban it after they joined UN.<p>So, we can thank those guys for making policies that worldwide raise crime, help supporting organized crime on massive scale (brutal mexical cartels are a fine example, out of many, ie afghanistan)<p>It&#x27;s like thinking, that in banking/trading/brokering, it&#x27;s always the client&#x27;s best interest that&#x27;s primary drive.

First, Great Britain is smaller than many US states. The population density of ~780/sqmi is higher than all but 3 of US states. The majority of US states are under ~200 persons/sqmi. Outside of major cities and suburbs the nearest backup officer can routinely be 15 or more minutes away. As well, many areas have dangerous wild animals to deal with. Bears, coyotes, wolfs, etc. that Britain has mostly eliminated.<p>Secondly, in the US, we have the right to keep and bear arms, which means every one the routine patrol officer encounters should be assumed to be legally armed as well. It would put officers at a severe disadvantage to be unarmed when regularly dealing with armed suspects. In many states 5-10% of the population has a concealed carry permit, and in the majority (40+) of states open carry of a rifle is legal without any permit. Whether you agree with this or not, it&#x27;s a fact of life in most of the US that a large percent of the population is legally armed, so there seems no reason to arbitrarily limit police from also being armed as any individual citizen could be.",1418648956

I recently compared PyCharm (I had to purchase it for work) with Emacs and the number of plugins for the former is negligible in comparison. I <i>think</i> that this is because writing extensions/plugins for PyCharm is so much harder than for Emacs: no scratch, no built-in API docs, no full blown book on scripting (like Elisp info), no macro->defun ability, no defadvice, no find-function/find-library and so on and on and on...<p>Of course, the other reason may be the fact that Emacs has 30 years worth of code written for it :) but I think without matching Emacs extensibility features no editor will ever come close to it in terms of extensions. LightTable looks promising in this regard, so does Atom, but other than these all editors/IDEs look like they don&#x27;t treat extensibility seriously. Which is why I&#x27;m still using Emacs as my primary workspace.<p>> Did you know that there is a really powerful PDF<p>You mean with DocView mode?

You know, cover to cover, as I&#x27;d do with any good book. Of course, along the way I switched to reading it inside Emacs, and I skipped some parts I decided I&#x27;m very unlikely to ever use, but I can assure you that it&#x27;s all there. Perhaps a need for such a book is an Emacs failure in itself (because the interface is not discoverable by itself?), but at least it is there.

8751713,comment,8750898,8751457,0,0,Matthias247,,,"Regarding the futures:<p>These are futures that you only can synchronously wait on (like what is currently available as std::future). However there is no possibilty to attach continuations that run when the value of the future is available. E.g. like the C++17 concurrency proposals, C#&#x27;s `Task` type or Javas `CompletableFuture`. These all rely on storing some kind of callback or closure inside the Future.
That&#x27;s not easy in Rust because it leads to situations where ownership is no longer obvious. The continuation might need to capture objects that are still needed locally (so you need something similar to Rc<RefMut<SomeThing>> ). In the most simply example&#x27;s the continuation needs a mutable reference to the Future itself whereas the Future-producing operation also has one. And if you have possibilities that the continuation could run on another thread/executor than the calling thread (which is possible with the other languages) things get more complicated.<p>Regarding asio. You don&#x27;t have to deep dive very much here:
Simply consider boost::asio::async_write(socket, buffer, [](error_code, bytes_transferred) { /* Do something with the result
*/ });<p>You need some mutable objects (like socket or the object that contains socket) locally AND you need acccess to them in your continuation. This will only work &quot;safely&quot; with garbage-collected or ref-counted types and these do still not seem to work for interfaces.",1418648409

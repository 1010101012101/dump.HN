There are many ways to analyze a given population that reveals different clusters. Being an outlier of this cluster is a factor in merit. The question is, is race a relevant dimension to consider?

It has absolutely nothing to do with preventing nuclear warfare between those nations already possessing them.<p>We haven't had nuclear war because so far, nobody who either actually wants to end the world, or is stupid enough to think he can ""win"" a nuclear war, has been in control of nuclear weapons. Not because of some piece of paper saying ""I promise I won't kill you"". Hilter had one of those with Stalin, how'd that work out?<p>""Cyber warfare"" doesn't have the problems of nuclear warfare. It's unlikely to end the world, it's relatively cheap, the tools are widely available, and unlike physical warfare which destroys economies, it's actually <i>about</i> the economy.

The world some non-technical people live in where ""cyber warfare"" is all about winning actual wars is a world of fantasy.<p>In human history, only one thing has reliably stopped wars, and that is the tying together of nations' economies so closely that war between them becomes economically impossible.

3544481,comment,3543652,3543652,6,0,tensor,,,"The key point of the article seems to be embodied in this quote:<p><i>So we PHP people are good at failing early, fast and cheap. If you want enterprise grade fail, ask the java guys, if you want scalable fail, ask the c guys. If you want smart fail, ask the clojure guys. But early and cheap, ask us.</i><p>The claim here is that one can get to a working product using PHP substantially faster than with other languages. However, the article has no data to back this claim up. Indeed, one of the big goals of newer languages like Clojure, Python, and Ruby (the latter two not being explicitly mentioned) is to write code faster and with fewer  errors. Java, while verbose, also has strengths: a great many excellent frameworks and libraries. This is also true for web development (e.g. <a href=""http://www.playframework.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.playframework.org/</a>). Including C in the argument is a little strange. As far as I've seen, it's one of the least used languages for deploying web applications these days!<p>In summary, I am wholly unconvinced by the claim of this article. And I say claim as it's missing any substantial argument. Does anyone have any actual data here? There are certainly many case studies for the newer languages and frameworks if you dig a bit.

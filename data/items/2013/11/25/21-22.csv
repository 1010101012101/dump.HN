6797377,comment,6796219,6797086,9,0,aaronem,,,"It&#x27;s interesting you blame the Nazi Reich for &quot;the bad eugenics&quot;, as you name them. The Nazis got their eugenic ideas, whole and entire, from the United States[1], where a eugenics movement born and nurtured in California was remarkable even among the well-meaning but disastrous social engineering movements of the Progressive Era. I strongly encourage you to read the linked article, and given the evident depth of your interest in the subject to further study the volume from which that article was drawn.<p>For example, you may have heard of <i>Buck v. Bell</i>, a 1927 Supreme Court decision which affirmed the constitutionality of involuntary eugenic sterilization. (Holmes: &quot;Three generations of imbeciles are enough.&quot;) The Nazi eugenicists, when brought to account at Nuremberg after the war, mounted a defense which revolved around the American eugenics movement in general and this Supreme Court decision in particular.<p>For further example, perhaps you share the common misconception that the idea of mass execution for eugenic reasons, and the particular method of using gas chambers for this purpose, originated in some uniquely twisted mind among the Nazi eugenicists. This is not the case; that purpose, and that method by which to achieve it, were first postulated in a 1918 Army textbook, which drew inspiration from a 1911 Carnegie Foundation-funded &quot;Preliminary Report of the Committee of the Eugenic Section of the American Breeder&#x27;s Association to Study and to Report on the Best Practical Means for Cutting Off the Defective Germ-Plasm in the Human Population.&quot;<p>As you see, the United States has made this mistake once before, even to the extent of enshrining it in our highest canon of law. The Nazi regime, far from originating these ideas we now recognize for the horrors they are, merely took them to their logical conclusion; in judging the entire Jewish race an intolerable blight upon the genetic purity of a nation, and acting in accord with the vanguard of then-modern eugenic theory to prevent that blight from spreading further, the Third Reich demonstrated conclusively and incontrovertibly the fundamental inhumanity of the entire eugenic concept. In that demonstration, the modern objections to eugenic ideas find their origins and their vehemence -- this latter, in particular, perhaps all the more telling in a society whose disinterest in the hard-won lessons of history seems to grow by leaps and bounds.<p>Consider, too, that the leading exponents of eugenics in decades past were every bit the equal of anyone today in their conviction that they were the intelligent and enlightened wave of the future, and perhaps you may find it easier to understand how your &quot;ghost from the past&quot; could -- given enough arrogant confidence that we know enough not to repeat past mistakes but may this time rely upon ourselves to do it <i>right</i> -- turn out a vicious revenant after all.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://hnn.us/article/1796\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hnn.us/article/1796</a>",1385416783

6797369,comment,6794122,6794499,1,0,dragonwriter,,,"> The bigger question is why is the FDA having a seizure over this?<p>Um, they aren&#x27;t having a seizure. 23andMe was informed of the regulatory requirements in a letter in June 2010 [1], and (as discussed in the Warning Letter just issued) submitted required documentation to begin the approval process in July and September of 2012. The FDA sent letters identifying issues with the submitted documentation and requesting additional information in order for the approval process to move forward on September 13, 2012 and received no response from 23andMe.<p>The FDA set follow up letters in March and May of 2013 indicating that due to 23andMe&#x27;s failure to address the issues raised in the FDA&#x27;s earlier letter, the applications submitted in 2012 were deemed withdrawn -- which meant that 23andMe was not only not in compliance, but no longer considered to be actively working toward compliance -- but still took no substantive action, giving the company time to begin working toward compliance again.<p>Now, more than a year since raising issues with 23andMe&#x27;s original submission, more than 3 years since notifying them that they needed to come into compliance, and 6 months after notifying 23andMe that their failure to respond to the issues raised with their initial submissions had caused those submissions to lapse, they&#x27;ve given 23andMe notice that they will face regulatory action if they don&#x27;t either stop marketing the products or provide an acceptable plan within 2 weeks.<p>That&#x27;s not exactly &quot;having a seizure&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/Industry/UCM215240.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/ResourcesforYou/...</a>",1385416704

You just need to clean up your stack before making the call, and make sure to arrange your calling convention such that A can call B, which can jump to C, which can return directly to A.<p>In the A -> B -> C example, this means:<p>1) Using a callee-pops convention so that callees pop arguments off the stack rather than callers. If B and C take different numbers of arguments, A doesn&#x27;t know how many arguments to pop. So functions should pop their arguments off the stack themselves before they return.<p>2) B must restore its callee-save registers before jumping to C, which will save those registers itself if it clobbers them.<p>3) To accommodate variadic functions, there has to be a hidden argument to let callees know how many arguments were actually pushed by the caller, so they can pop the right number.",1385416617

6797346,comment,6796796,6796796,1,0,pushnell,,,"I finally managed to do this almost a year ago.  Really, this comes down to understanding (and accepting) that your body is built for adaptation.  The more steadily you feed it regular inputs, the more it will embrace those inputs and come to expect them.<p>- Force yourself to wake up at the same time every day -- no sleeping in on weekends.<p>- You should know roughly how much sleep you need in a night, and arrange your life so that you can get in bed X + 1 hours before the time you want to wake up.<p>If you can&#x27;t do these two things at least 90% of your days, you won&#x27;t succeed.  Later (2-3 months later), once you&#x27;ve established your pattern and are well adapted to it, you&#x27;ll have a bit more flexibility with your schedule and still be able to maintain it.<p>A few things that helped me accomplish these goals:<p>- Exercise (cardio) first thing in the morning.  You will find yourself getting sleepy much earlier in the day.  Don&#x27;t exercise at night, as the endorphins can take several hours to disperse and will keep you awake until then.  After about three weeks of morning cardio, your body will begin to adapt the timing of your energy cycles and you will find yourself springing out of bed ready to run.  I have used this to my advantage to replace my &quot;night owl&quot; tendencies with &quot;morning person&quot; tendencies on the days off from the gym.  I also find it more productive, as my mind is fully rested.<p>- Melatonin.  Presumably, you&#x27;re staring at a screen of some sort many hours a day like most people on HN.  Blue light inhibits natural melatonin production, so to compensate, take a melatonin supplement 1-2 hours before you intend to actually fall asleep.  (You should experiment to find out what the lowest dose is for you which still helps you fall asleep.)  Also, turn off as many room lights as you can at that time, and dim any screens you&#x27;re viewing.<p>Like I said, it can take a few weeks to initially shift your schedule, and a few months to fully adapt to it, but it can be done if you&#x27;re dedicated.  Best of luck.",1385416479

Regarding CAP, I think that given redundant cluster interconnects, redundant managed power, odd # of cluster managers for quorum, all mean that split brain is just about out of the question, configured properly.<p>The main reason that I have a FAQ about Hadoop is that I have been asked repeatedly by people, &quot;what&#x27;s the difference between InfiniSQL & Hadoop?&quot; It seems to be the data project most on a lot of people&#x27;s minds. It&#x27;s a fair question, so I created an FAQ entry on my site.<p>I don&#x27;t know what Impala or Shark&#x27;s performance are for transaction processing. Show me the numbers, in other words. I don&#x27;t believe that Hadoop is going to eat the world, but that it&#x27;s best use cases are probably in the reporting realm. It seems that Impala wants to bridge that gap between reporting and operational/transactional database--but I can&#x27;t read from their architectural description just how well it would actually perform for transaction processing workloads.<p>Regarding Shark, it looks to me like they still see it as an parallelized reporting system, and not geared towards OLTP/operational workloads.<p>I expect that InfiniSQL will be able to handle quite sophisticated analytics workloads, as more capabilities are added, but they will be more for real-time. I don&#x27;t see it displacing special purpose analytics environments, especially the masive unstructured ones.<p>Regarding filtering, aggregation, windowing, I haven&#x27;t documented it yet.

The most common speculation was that it was marketed and perceived as a gaming machine. For some reason this was mutually exclusive with being a serious business machine.<p>It&#x27;s really fascinating how far hardware acceleration was able to take that machine. It took a long time before I felt that a PC was even close in responsiveness to my Amiga. Though to be honest at the end it was equipped with a MC68060 which was no slouch. Using a metal cutter and some force it was also possible to squeeze a 3.5&quot; hard drive in an A1200. But eventually the controller hardware broke down and would fry any hard drive connected to it. This was in 1998 so by that time it was pretty difficult to get spare parts if I remember correctly and to be honest the Pentium II I had at the time was a lot faster. So the Amiga went back into its box where it still lives today.<p>Some of my best programming memories are from assembly coding on that machine.

Still thinking it was a dumb question and not knowing how Stack Overflow works, attempts to blank out the question and request deletion.<p>* A user with 22k rep (i.e., a power user) goes in and rolls back the question.<p>* The asker rolls back the rollback.<p>At this point, the appropriate thing to do is flag the question for a moderator (important addendum: <i>and move on</i>). That doesn&#x27;t happen. Instead:<p>* The power user—who really should know better—gets into a petty rollback war with the asker, and the question gets reverted 15 times in 5 minutes before <i>another</i> power user steps in and reverts it.<p>* The roll back wars stop, but an hour later a diamond moderator steps in and locks the question anyway. (Correction: I originally said it was unlocked 45 minutes later, but child comments correctly point out it was unlocked automatically a week later).<p>* The asker, who by all appearances has asked a single question, gets banned for 15 years.[1]<p>* The question, while not the best question ever, is decent enough and gets interesting answers but somehow gets a -35 score (edit: now down to -41 in the 20 minutes since I posted this comment), making it one of the worst questions on the site.[2] The comments[3] speculate that it was due to the edit war.

If both UPS systems detect their upstream PDU&#x27;s as being out, then the InfiniSQL management protocol will initiate graceful shutdown, including persisting to disk. For write() issues, at least intially, I think that stuff in commodity hardware (such as ECC memory) is sufficient protection in most cases. Attaching a high end storage array, or using ZFS, also protects against low level disk problems. I don&#x27;t see those problems as needing to be solved for a 1.0 relase, but am very much open to contributions that address those issues any time you want!<p>The fundamental insight about not needing transaction logs is pretty simple actually: if the power is guaranteed to either stay on, or to allow the system to quiesce gracefully, then the cluster will not suddenly crash. That&#x27;s the motivator for transaction logs--to make sure that the data will still be there if the system suddenly crashes. Get rid of the need for transaction logs, get rid of the transaction logs.<p>Regarding consensus, I expect that there will be a quorum protocol in use amongst an odd number greater than 2 of manager processes, each with redundant network and power. But the specific protocol I haven&#x27;t ironed out. If there&#x27;s something I can grab off the shelf then it may be preferable to implementing from scratch, but I haven&#x27;t gotten there yet.<p>This stuff hasn&#x27;t been implemented yet, but the core around which it can be implemented, has been.<p>Do I sense a volunteer? ;-)",1385413342

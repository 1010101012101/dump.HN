I have similar functions in my .bash_profile for git and it doesn&#x27;t require node. Consider this: I can easily scp my dotfiles to a server and use all my shortcuts. To use this I have to install Node, npm, and this package to gain a couple of new shortcuts that make existing functions a little prettier.",1425837536

I did not agree with the direction Opera was taken after they switched from the Presto rendering engine to Blink. Many of the features focused on power users were thrown out, and when users complained to Opera, they were told to wait on extension developers to fill in the gaps. Many people prefer not to have to install multiple extensions and therefore have to trust multiple extension developers. I hope Vivaldi is successful in filling the void left by the changes to Opera.",1425837401

Here are some rebuttals to pieces from the article...<p><i>which is that there’s no reliable convention for where the first partition should begin, so it’s difficult to be sure there’ll be enough space.</i><p>The MBR layout has been pretty much standardised, even if not officially - just look at the partition entries in it.<p><i>The only way to do this, in the BIOS/MBR world, is for the bootloaders to handle it; but there’s no widely accepted convention for the right way to do this.</i><p>It doesn&#x27;t matter, you just have to figure out what each OS&#x27;s bootloaders do, and whether you can chain them (most of them do.)<p><i>another advantage of UEFI booting: it provides a standard way for booting from, for instance, a remote server.</i><p>PXE does this and it&#x27;s been in traditional BIOSes for a <i>long</i> time...<p><i>There’s no mechanism for levels above the firmware to configure the firmware’s boot behaviour.</i><p>I&#x27;d consider that a <i>good</i> thing.<p><i>Hopefully it’s clear why this is a better design: instead of having to write bootloader code to the ‘magic’ space at the start of an MBR disk, operating systems and so on can just create, format and mount partitions in a widely understood format and put bootloader code and anything else that they might want the firmware to read there.</i><p>The firmware shouldn&#x27;t need to incorporate a filesystem driver, because that is a higher-level functionality. Its job should just be to initialise the hardware, boot from a disk/network/etc., and get out of the way. In this regard, the traditional and <i>very</i> elegantly simple &quot;read the first 512 bytes from the selected boot device (it need not be a disk, PXE does this) into memory at 7c00h and jump to it&quot; is probably the best way to do it.<p><i>“Any firmware is crap code”. Usually pretty accurate.</i><p>Ironic, since with UEFI there&#x27;s plenty more code to go wrong than there is with traditional BIOS.

Get some more.\nSocial science for work in HR?\nGot some more.<p>The rest of the humanities?\nWomen on the way to their Mrs. degree.<p>Business?  A CPA is a good career\ncareer path, especially for women.<p>Women doing well in math in college?\nSure:  They want to be K-12 math\nteachers.<p>But, from the OP, apparently still<p>&quot;whereas men take up computing,\nengineering and the exact sciences&quot;<p>so that the men are still there for\ntechnical training for hard work\nof applications, not just teaching,\nin a career.<p>To be more clear,\nfor the &quot;academically&quot; part of the title here, \nwe&#x27;re talking\nthe real goal of academics, chaired profs\nat the top research universities, maybe?\nNobel prize winners in the physical sciences?\nFields Medal winners (math)?  The girls/women\nare doing better there -- gee, why&#x27;d I not\nnotice?<p>Oh, I understand!  In part we&#x27;re talking K-6\nwhere the girls have better manual dexterity,\nbetter hand writing, better verbal talent,\nbetter social skills (how to please instead\nof piss off the teachers, nearly all woman),\nbetter clerical talent (keep those columns\nin long division nicely lined up),\nmuch more interest in fictional reading,\nbetter social skills working in groups,\nmuch more eager to </i>behave well* in \nclass.  Ah, now <i>that&#x27;s</i> much of what is meant\nby &quot;academically&quot;!!<p>Gee, what&#x27;s that got to do with high\nend academic success?  Well, let&#x27;s see:\nGood starting attitude for such success is,<p>&quot;That old stuff is junk.\nPitch it.\nLet&#x27;s do some much better, new\nstuff.  E.g., Maxwell did really\nwell, but he was never clear on\nwhat would happen if the lab\nwere moving rapidly, say, near\nthe speed of light.  So, looks\nlike need to tweak Maxwell&#x27;s equations.<p>Or, the Riemann integral?  Gotta be kidding!\nLooks like we can redo integration theory\nand integrate darned near anything and\nshow that a function on a finite\nclosed interval has a Riemann integral\nif and only it is continuous everywhere\nexcept on a set of length 0.<p>Control theory?  Sure.  But what about\nin gusty winds?  Now what?  How \n&#x27;bout some <i>stochastic</i> optimal\ncontrol?<p>Malaria caused by <i>bad air</i>?  Gotta\nbe kidding.  Let&#x27;s find out what\nthe real cause is.  How about \nsomething from all those mosquito\nbites?<p>I can&#x27;t do linear regression because\nsome variable was listed twice or\nsome variables are linear combinations\nof some of the others?  Silly.  Yes,\nI know, the normal equations matrix\ndoes not have full row rank and, thus,\ndoesn&#x27;t have an inverse,\nbut why do we have to go through\nthat matrix inverse stuff?  We don&#x27;t!&quot;<p>In the 10th grade I had such a case:\nMy plane geometry teacher was \na very ugly and angry woman.\nIt was a good high school,\nand she actually could mostly work\nthe exercises, but otherwise she\nwas not much of a mathematician.<p>So, no way did I want to have my\nknowledge of plane geometry, a subject\nI loved, owe anything to her.\nSo, I slept in class and refused to\nclaim to do any of the homework.<p>But, I no doubt did by far the most\nhomework of anyone in the class,\nsolved every non-trivial problem in\nthe book including the more difficult\nsupplementary problems in the back.<p>So, on the state test, I came in\nsecond in the class (the same guy\nbeat me by a few points on the\nMath SAT also).<p>But on that test\nthe last problem was about\ninscribing a square in a semi-circle --\ntwo corners were to be on the\ndiameter and the other two, on the\narc.  How to do that?<p>I said, go off on the side and\nconstruct a square, bisect one side,\nuse that point as center and\nthe distance to an opposite \ncorner as radius, and draw a\ncircle.  Extend the bisected side\nto a diameter.  Now have a figure\nsimilar to the desired one.\nSo, for the given figure,\njust need, say, the length of\nhalf a side.  So, that will be\na forth proportional.  So \nconstruct that and, ..., done.<p>So, I wanted to check this and\ninsisted over her objections that the teacher \nsee me after school.\nShe said I couldn&#x27;t go off\non the side and construct that\nother figure.\nSounded like nonsense to me.<p>As a college freshman, a girl\nasked me, given triangle\nABC, construct D on AB\nand E on BC so that AD = DE = EC.\nHmm ....  Go off on the side\nand construct a figure \nsimilar to the desired one\nand for the crucial length\nAD, get that from a fourth\nproportional.<p>The girl asked, &quot;How&#x27;d you\nknow to do that?&quot;<p>I told her it&#x27;d figured it out\nin the 10th grade.<p>She said, &quot;That&#x27;s the\nadvanced technique <i>smilitude</i>\nwe are studying.&quot;<p>&quot;Well, I reinvented it in the\n10th grade, and the teacher\nsaid I couldn&#x27;t do that.&quot;<p>No wonder I didn&#x27;t much pay attention\nto the teacher.<p>High end academics is about \nresearch, research, and research.\nThere have to do some things that\nare new, and typically have to\nbe the first one ever to do that thing.\nSo, have to be able to\nsay that not everything from the\npast is the best possible\nand can stand up as the first\nperson ever to say how to do better,\nand that&#x27;s not what gets\ngood grades in K-6 or most of\nK-12 or most subjects in \ncollege.<p>Looks like the OP is talking about\nnothing very new, different, or\nsurprising.<p>Or maybe:  Men went for the technical\nfields hoping to use such as a foundation\nfor a career, but now the main <i>technical</i>\ncareer is computing, and there most of\nwhat a student needs on a job they have\nto learn themselves with/without \ncourse in computer science.  So, a lot of\npeople are concluding that college is\nnot really essential for a good start\nin computing.  For engineering as a\ncareer, that&#x27;s less popular than before.<p>Physics?  A lot of the interest there\nwas in work in US national security,\nbut that work less hot as a field than\nsome decades ago.<p>But for K-12 teaching, nursing,\npharmacy, law, HR, CPA, etc., those\n<i>female</i> fields have remained\nrelatively solid.  So, women\nare still doing well in their\nfields while the men are \nhaving to build careers heavily\noutside of what is taught in\ncollege.",1425835624

5759142,comment,5756911,5758718,1,0,smhinsey,,,"Yeah, I don't get that approach at all. I started with that, ran into a case where I wanted a route resolve, couldn't figure out how to do it without a huge amount of hassle, and ended up reorganizing around screens. I do still have global services, directives, and filters, but I define them as close to screens as I can and only pull them up to a global scope when necessary. The module-per-screen approach makes a lot of sense from both Angular and Require's perspective, I think.<p>We use the optimizer as well, during our build process, so you can use require to load everything during development and then optimize everything down into a single file later. The optimizer is pretty powerful and supports several different scenarios for doing this.",1369339055

The specs were built very much driven by committee oriented thinking, and the resulting UX implementations out of the gate were much more complicated than the Facebook Connect experience.

They don't even have to be in direct contact with the actual development team, just access to the source code and developer design documents should be enough. For a company the size of Google with the amount of profits they make, 'small team' is just not an excuse for anything.<p>The move is definitely deliberate, they can't have Skype come in and allow people with Skype to make calls to hangout  when the hangout client can't make calls into Skype.

A ""thin client"" actually runs an X Server, and you remotely launch an xterm on the central server as an ""x client"", exported to your display.<p>However, as the email states, this only gets you the same access your user already had on the remote system, unless it's a setuid program. The canonical example and only one I can think of off the top of my head is xscreensaver or xlock.

5759124,comment,5758346,5758346,18,0,orangethirty,,,"The bigger issue here is that Google is integrating everything into G+. They are moving away from being a search engine, towards being a social network with better search capabilities than Facebook. The problem is that the average Google users (read, non hacker, and generally not computer smart) does not understand the changes. They just go to Google to learn about a new chicken recipe, or what side-effects does Singulair has. They don't go there to socialize. And Google is forcing this into everybody. Which is a significant deal, because for a lot of people out there ( a lot) Google <i>is</i> the internet. Just like AOL was in the 90's, Google is now. They are diluting their brand, and going in every direction. Before you say anything else, I use google products. I like Google. I remember their old nerdy logo. I loved how they took on the old search engines of yore, and beat them at their own game. But it has reached a point where Google is now a faceless corporation simply driven to profit. All of their actions point to that. They seem to no longer really care about the users. Just like IBM, MS, and all the old tech giants. Management has taken over. The true hacker spirit seems to not be found anymore.",1369338856

When I was in consulting, I didn't waste my time trying to track every 5-minute increment, the amount of effort and distraction that would cause would do more harm to the client (due to productivity loss from tracking) than anything else.  Taking a 5-minute coffee break, or chatting with a co-worker for 15 minutes all gets lost in the noise if you are working on a project for multiple hours a day.  Your level of focus (which is nearly impossible to quantify) is going to have a bigger impact on your productivity, and hence the value to the client, than almost anything else.  So it makes sense that you should look to optimize for focus/productivity, rather than 'time spent sitting in front of computer'.<p>On a side note, there has been a lot of talk on HN about billing clients in half-day and full-day increments.  You should probably look into that.  At the consulting job, I basically took the total number of hours a day that I was working, and roughly divided it by the percent of time I spent on each project, which also worked for me (we were required to bill hourly).  In the long run, it all tends to even out, and as long as your client is happy with the work, and the costs are in line with their expectations, they will not complain.",1369338638

For the rest of the 10% of the time when you do need to query the DOM, you only need to go one step below a directives element (direct children).

Here, conveniently, there are no gates; so the theorem says that you get entangled results even though the entangled things don't exist simultaneously, because they <i>could have</i> if you'd pushed the measurement to the end of the experiment.<p>The linear description of events describes the time-order that the actual experiment used.",1369338015

Sincerly and honestly: <i>NAT does not solve anything that a firewall (6 lines of ip6tables rules) - or stopping that unecessary service - doesn't</i>. All it does is create two classes of network devices (and netizens): those that can talk directly and those who depend on a third party. There's no reason not to have a global address anymore, even if you don't expect to use it. Even something as simple as putting a firewall appliance in the middle is the wrong approach. Logic needs to be near the edge, in the host IMHO; by putting any rules in the middle (firewall, NAT, QoS), other than the basic routing, one loses the intended ability to dial direct in unanticipated scenarios tomorrow (for example, to run a new service without touching every hop between A and B because of dozens of attempts to ""make it better"" at that hop).

Of course, for 40 cents a month, I think those numbers are pretty reasonable.<p>More appropriate would be the ""full"" accounts, which have a much more reasonable 300MB/600MB hourly/daily data quota.

5758957,comment,5758192,5758192,71,0,bane,,,"Fun SQLite story, I had a project that needed to do reasonably large scale data processing (gigabytes of data) on a pretty bare boned machine in a pretty bare boned environment at a customer location. I had a fairly up-to-date perl install and notepad. For the process the data needed to look at any single element in the data and find elements similar to it. I thought long and hard about various complex data structures and caching bits to disk to make portions of the problem set fit into memory, and various ways of searching the data. It was okay if the process took a couple days to finish.<p>It suddenly hit me, I wonder if the sysadmins had installed DBD::SQLite...yes they had!<p>Why mess with all that crap if I could just use SQLite. Reasonably fast indexing, expressive searching tools, I could dump the data onto disk <i>and</i> use an in memory SQLite db at the same time, caching solved. It turned weeks of agonizing work (producing fragile code) and turned it into a quick 2 week coding romp. The project was a huge success and spread to a couple other departments.<p>One day they asked if I could advise a group to build a more ""formal"" implementation of the system as they were finding the results valuable. A half dozen developers and a year later they had succeeded in building a friendlier web interface running on a proper RDBMS (Oracle 10something) with some hadoop goodness running the processing stuff on 8 or 9 dedicated machines.<p>In the meantime, and largely because SQLite let me query into the data in more and more useful ways that I hadn't foreseen, I had extended the original prototype significantly and it was outperforming their larger scale solution on a 3 year old, <i>very unimpressive</i>, desktop with the same install of perl and sqlite. On top of the raw calculations, it was also performing some automated results analysis and spitting out ready to present artifacts that could be stuck in your presentation tool of choice. Guess which ones the users actually used?<p>Soon I had a users group, regular monthly releases and was running a semi-regular training class on this cooky command line tool (since most users had never seen a command line). I've since finished that job up and moved on, and last I heard my little script using SQLite was in heavy use, the enterprise dev team was still struggling getting the performance of their solution up to the levels of my original script, and hadn't even touched the enhancements yet.<p>SQLite was rock-iron solid the entire time. I had a few things I wished it could do, but I usually found a way to manage. I wasn't using it for its feature, it existing <i>was</i> the feature. SQLite sprinkled magic on my one-off hack job and turned into a <i>thing</i> that people ended up using.",1369337463

5758826,comment,5755852,5757548,2,0,lobster_johnson,,,"That Reddit post is great. For me, in learning Haskell, the biggest challenge has been libraries. Many of them just seem badly designed, or unfinished.<p>My first project I wrote a simple scraping tool that scrapes a certain web site and organizes the information in a database behind a front end and API. Immediately I encountered several problems that would have been a cakewalk in, say, Ruby:<p>* The HTTP library (Network.HTTP) is not encoding-aware. It ignores Content-Type and returns a String with some undefined encoding. So if you grab a resource which is, say, ISO-8859-1, anything that works with UTF-8 will potentially blow up.<p>* (And if you do this yourself, there is no built-in way to parse MIME charsets into Haskell encoding names except by writing it yourself, I think.)<p>* The string libraries are confusing. There is String, but also Text. Both are supposed to be Unicode-aware, but many of the operations you want are in Text, requiring conversions back and forth.<p>* I could not, and still haven't, figured out how to convert a ByteString containing ISO-8859-1 to an UTF-8 string. Data.Encoding apparently exists for that, but I could not get it to work like I wanted. I ended up with this lovely mantra (which you wouldn't think had anything to do with ISO-8859-1, but it does) and left it like that just because it works:<p><pre><code>    decodeLatin1 bytes = Data.Text.unpack $ Data.Text.pack $
      Data.ByteString.Char8.unpack bytes
</code></pre>
* There are multiple libs for HTML/XML parsing, and no clear winner. HaXml was buggy and did not parse my HTML correctly. TagSoup and HandsomeSoup had weird APIs I did not like. I ended up with HXT, which uses Haskell arrow syntax extensively and is therefore incomprehensible, even when I understand what and how it does it. It feels a lot like people who write ambitious libs in Ruby with too much ""magic"". Haskell is a functional language and should be <i>wonderful</i> for parsing HTML/XML using XPath or CSS selectors, but it's a nightmare. HXT's parser is impure by default (!) and you have to google some tutorials to find out how to use its pure version, which the tutorial writers (in the same breath) dissuade you from using.<p>* For the frontend I ended up using Happstack Lite because it's small and about as easy to get started with as Sinatra. Unfortunately, the first templating system it recommends, Blaze, is crap. With Blaze you write the template inline, building an XML tree, similar to Ruby's ""Builder"" gem, but the syntax is ugly and unnecessarily complicated. The other recommended templating systems, HSP and Hamlet, are like ERB or PHP, so a serious step backwards from HAML. In the end, I could not find anything like HAML.<p>* I haven't delved very deeply into Happstack yet, but like many Haskell libs it seems to make simple things more complicated than they ought to be (eg., the routing system). One annoyance I remember is the fact that HTTP verbs aren't IO, which makes code less intuitive, since obviously in a modern web app, HTTP verbs are going to be doing IO (things like talking to databases), and so you have to use liftIO a lot.<p>* Perhaps the biggest issue for me was the general lack of high-quality documentation (Happstack itself has almost none). Sure, there are tons of searchable machine-generated docs, which is great, but that documentation lacks the bits that tie everything together. Since Haskell is mainly about applying functions to values of types, it is very decentralized; knowing what function to use is only part of the game. It's just as important to know how its return value plays with the rest of the function space, because so much of Haskell revolves around composing functions in idiomatic ways. This is very different from, say, Ruby, where you know a method returns an object, and an object only has the methods its class provides; this centralizes, clusters and constrains the information into easily digestible pieces.<p>A veteran haskeller would probably not struggle too much with these things. But as a novice, I expected the path to be slightly easier. The language was rarely a problem, the libraries definitely were.",1369336382

Customers remember comparative advertising better, digest it more effectively, and it helps disseminate cognitive information clearly.  Ironically, customers internalize comparative advertising more often with regards to the product being denigrated (ie. ""This product is worse!"") than with the product being promoted (ie. ""This product is better!"")  This is important with low-effort purchases like <$20 consumer goods.<p>(As an aside: I think the idea of making comparative advertisements illegal is absolutely absurd.

The program effectively provides similar functionality to Gnu Screen, however as it was originally written under an old version of AIX, it will require about a week's worth of fixup work to get it ready for modern systems.<p>So, my question: is it worth open sourcing it?  It does provide some functionality that Screen lacks, such as emulating one terminal type on another one (specifically, ""screen protect"" (forms) mode of the Televideo series terminals, which was required for the app that was used under this system).  Also, I had some preliminary work on drop down menus, etc., along with starting a number of sessions pre-loaded with specific applications.<p>So would anyone else find this utility useful, and if so, is there other pieces of functionality that Gnu Screen lacks that you would like to see implemented?

But if you <i>are</i> the market leader, you don't throw punches at competitors, because you're already winning and doing so just reminds the viewer/reader/whatever that other alternatives exist.<p>This mitigates the ""defenseless kid"" syndrome a bit, because if you only punch up you're by definition only taking on products that are stronger in the marketplace than yours is.<p>You can see this in action by comparing Apple's ads. They had no problem running the ""I'm a Mac"" ads when their product (the Mac) was far behind the market leader (Windows PCs).

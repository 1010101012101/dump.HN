That phase will be over soon.  \nQuestion for Paul: what alternative investment vehicles will arise in the years to come?  How about some smaller-scale buyout businesses?",1228649608

I don't really think either one of them considered the reader to be a complete beginner or ""retarded"", although the former is probably more down-and-dirty with the language than the latter is, which is more of an introductory text. Who hasn't seen one of those for any language?<p>If you want a retarded cocoa book, check out the older Mac programming-related texts O'Reilly used to publish a few years ago. Out of print now I think, but man, they REALLY assumed you were a complete beginner. Not that that was a bad thing, but Hillegass is definitely miles better.",1228649542

The benefit of extensions like packages, type checking and so on may be large, but the cost is also large because you have to abandon compatibility with existing code and libraries.<p>Mascara (<a href=""http://ecmascript4.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ecmascript4.com/</a>) is a different approach - it extends Javascript with classes, types, namespaces and so on, but it does it in a backwardly compatible manner, so you can still utilize your old code, use JQuery and so on.",1228648538

I can't wait to see the next post.<p>The concept of Tetris is pretty simple; many of guys here might have written some variation of it (I myself wrote one in Z80 assembler back in college to show my crude hand-made PC could be of some use :-)  The ""modern"" Tetris has been evolved since then, though.  I didn't realize that until I had a project with the official Tetris game.  There are various rules that affect gameplay in subtle ways (have you heard of SuperRotation?).  It is possible that somebody who is very good at the ""good old"" Tetris will not be good at the modern Tetris.   I assume that's why the Tetris Company wants to define ""The Tetris"" to make sure people who play do play the same game.   On what legal basis they do that, I don't know and that's why I'm curious where you'll go.",1228648185

6893667,comment,6889752,6893083,2,0,monsterix,,,"Wait, yes. Dude, Alexander and Genghis Khan are like they happened only yesterday. Hindusim is much older than all of that, and I don&#x27;t mean only in terms of religion. The culture itself is very old, so to speak.<p>God this is going to be a long comment.<p>I don&#x27;t know how immersed you are w.r.t Hinduism, which gave birth to, no rather off-shooted other religions like Buddhism & Jainism. Here I can only give a very top-level view to help you make an entry:<p>There are two epics of the Hindus: The Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Read both, they&#x27;re brilliant classics. These two epics are stories about rise and fall of political power, affairs, conceit and ensuing wars between leaders of different Hindu kingdoms. Let&#x27;s say kingdoms of an aggregate land mass we now call India, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan that stretches up to far, far east to places like Cambodia.<p>I could not confirm how far in the west did Hinduism spread out but will do so given that I am excited about it now.<p>Both epics are mythology by today&#x27;s standards, but the stories in each are what Hindus vehemently believe as true. All (not most) of warring cities in both these epics exist inside and outside of India (or sunk under the ocean [1]) even today. I mean literally.<p>On axis of time, both these two epics are separated from each other by two &#x27;Yugas&#x27; [2]. We are living in the Kaliyug where kali == machines and yug == time-frame. Yugas are of varying length, first being Satayug about 1,728,000 million years. Man exists during this period as life forms from scratch in this universe. Alexander was like a fucking second ago when you&#x27;re talking ages of this length.<p>I suggest start with Yugas and you&#x27;ll start seeing math, numbers, conclusions, geometric progressions and astronomy right in there. No need to accept anything is true or false, w.r.t written and confirmed history. But you&#x27;ll love visiting places, and connecting it with the historical texts.<p>It goes up the Bohr&#x27;s model of atom (Paramaṇu), the theory of what nucleus and subatomic particles were about (hell yes!), the nuclear bomb (<i>Brahma Asthra</i>) and how these were used in warfare, negotiation and peace keeping. Several other concepts of what seems similar to magic of quantum physics, treatment of time-space curvature, extraterrestrial life, theory of relativity and additional dimensions of gravitational physics (though refuted by modern practitioners of course) all exist in discussions. May or may not be correct, but the level of thought can be appreciated.<p>Astronomy, for example, scales to the level of predicting solar cycles, cycles of universe (311.04 trillion years?[3]), variable length of life of man/species, sub-sub-events like the ice age, age of the machines, age of only truth which you will find pretty fascinating to read, if not believable.<p>Let me just throw in the starting point [2]:<p>[1] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarka\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarka</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuga\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuga</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrics_of_time_in_Hinduism\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrics_of_time_in_Hinduism</a>",1386841965

I was entering on a visa waiver for some meetings, and I was just coming off the back of another visa waiver trip. They were basically trying to prove that I was working illegally in the US. I had to empty the contents of my pockets and the bag I was carrying. The guy took my wallet, took every bank card out of it and asked me where the bank account was held, how much money was currently in the account and how much money went through the account each year. He made me switch my laptop on and spent some time looking through files on it. He literally told me &quot;I think you&#x27;re lying to me, you better come clean or this will be bad for you&quot;. He spent ages typing into my file on his computer (supposedly, maybe he was writing his girlfriend) and told me that if I ever tried to come back on a visa waiver I would be declined (untrue, as it turns out).<p>Obviously if you&#x27;re American it&#x27;s easier because they can&#x27;t deny you entry. I basically had two options - do everything he said, or go home, miss my meetings, and have to tick the &quot;I&#x27;ve been declined entry to the US&quot; box every single time I go to the US for the rest of my life, which would make every border crossing a multiple hour ordeal.",1386841892

Money saved through reduction of costs due to automation will naturally end up being spent elsewhere. We&#x27;ll end up with a much different mix of jobs than previously, but overall employment levels will not diminish. This has already happened numerous times even in the last century. Far fewer people are employed in mining and agriculture. Far fewer people are employed in manufacturing. And so on. Jobs change, the economy changes, people adapt.<p>Second, wages for &quot;the lower castes&quot; won&#x27;t fall or be left behind as much as people imagine. A big reason why being Baumol&#x27;s cost &quot;disease&quot;.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t view &quot;labor&quot; as a sad, helpless group of unwashed masses a la the &quot;proletariat&quot;. I don&#x27;t think they need to be babied or rescued from the terrifying advance of modernity, I think they need to be empowered to make the adaptions that they&#x27;ve always been capable of. The &quot;labor&quot; of the future that I imagine is a labor of skilled and passionate people, many of them self employed. We&#x27;re already seeing trends in that direction happening with things like craigslist, etsy, and kickstarter. A considerable amount of growth in the 21st century economy is coming not from &quot;professionals&quot; like software devs but from effectively blue collar folks, people who craft or cook or build or provide services.",1386841010

6893561,comment,6888623,6889352,1,0,memracom,,,"Docker simplifies the setting up of a server so that it becomes a set of building blocks. And it does so regardless of which server management framework you use. This means that you can ditch the more complicated Puppet and Chef and go for a simpler solution like Ansible and still manage a large number of servers.<p>So it is really a different approach to the problem space that Puppet and Chef have attacked. Docker only addresses the building blocks aspect of the problem, and leverages Linux kernel features that most sysadmins have not yet tried to incorporate into their systems. You can either choose to not use a server orchestration framework with Docker and stick with ssh and bash scripts. Or you can choose a lighter framework that is easier to learn and operate like SaltStack or Ansible. Those of use who have run Solaris systems in the past, know the advantages of containerization in partitioning system resources so we tend to be attracted by Docker.",1386839463

And when you do that you realize two things: \n1. No compiler is fully compliant with any standard. \n2. Every compiler has bugs so even the compliant parts can be unusable.<p>And then you realize it&#x27;s not a big deal. Changes between platforms are greater than changes between compilers. When your targets have different endianness or, even better, mixed endianness between different PUs - the standard compliance of your code is the least of your worries.<p>>It works if you only care about one specific compiler.<p>Also works if you care about a finite number of specific compilers and architectures.<p>>On those days the standard was the AT&T UNIX compiler.<p>There were, probably, hundreds of compilers and C flavors even before the ANSI C.

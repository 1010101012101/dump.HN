They don't break anything and you won't get bugged.<p>Plus, many people have huge hard drives and making backups of the OS isn't hard. You can fix it of course, but why bother when can you do it faster restoring from a backup..",1225435884
349714,comment,349630,349630,0,0,theantidote,,,"Here is the treehugger side of me, not the pragmatic side: where do we dispose of the waste? At the end of the day there's still waste created.<p>Here's some pragmatism: Why spend any money investing in a new short term solution when we could spend the same amount on renewable energy that never runs out such as wind, solar, tidal and for the most part hydrogen? In another few hundred years we will start running low on uranium (edit: Wikipedia says it can be reprocessed and used an estimated thousands of years). I think if we're going to transition from oil and coal we shouldn't just go to a new stop-gap solution. The next energy source needs to be renewable so we never run into the same problem again.",1225435871

349712,comment,348975,349664,0,0,azanar,,,"I agree that 10-15 references is totally bogus; I said so much in a reply to a different comment.<p>I'm still boggling though, actually more so than I was before your reply. You mention examples here that make the whole process seem incredibly error-prone, bound to result in false positives and negatives, and as you described it fraught with peril. This is a discouraging testament to the utility of doing reference checks.<p>I feel quite uneasy questioning years of standard hiring practice, but do the benefits of this sufficiently outweigh the drawbacks? You gather data about the candidate, but no metadata about the recommendation, which I can see make a considerable difference in how the reference is acted on. Metadata such as:<p>* the relationship dynamics of the recommender to other people besides the candidate<p>* how candid the recommender is about the benefits and drawbacks of things he/she evaluates<p>* what sort of events the recommender encountered, and what mood that set him/her in before talking with you.<p>All of these would put the recommendation in better context. There are probably other data points (recommendations of the recommenders, etc), that could be considered, and then there are time/benefit trade offs to decide which are best left unconsidered.<p>I will agree that a reference check will likely shuffle out someone who is obviously a raving lunatic, and would never work out no matter where they are hired. But, beyond that, it seems more nebulous. I have the sense that there is a combination of institutional inertia and real benefit that drives this practice; I want to understand where the bounds of each are, and whether my intuition is completely off-base.",1225435549

349709,comment,349676,349676,0,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"I could be wrong, but I think this letter illustrates why why many of us are attracted to startups.  This kind of esprit de corps, this sleeping under your desk and working around the clock doing everything you can to move the ball forward, this single-minded insanity that focuses 100% of your effort and will on building something amazing and changing the world forever.  Is it probably just naive and idealistic and ridiculous?  Yeah, it probably is.  But I think at the end of the day, many of us just want to be that committed to something.",1225434804

But unfortunately, I don't think it's a step up in terms of usability.<p>Ignoring stuff that others have already pointed out, there's no way to know which fields are required before you submit.

The discussion in this place is routinely exceptional in quality, and it seems to me the few occasions on which the case for group-think could be made could equally be explained by the fact that commenters sourced from such a narrow demographic are likely to do a fair bit of agreeing.<p>That said, I'd be aghast if we ever descended to the level of reddit.",1225433179

349695,comment,349412,349511,0,0,namnori,,,"Well, you are definitely right about one thing: policy analysis is, unfortunately, a task too exhaustive for the average American.  Therefore, I can definitely imagine a counterintuitive (but right) stance turning off voters.<p>However, one thing that I have learned throughout this whole financial crisis is that people do care. And regardless of whether or not the underlying problem(s) are generally understood, the public wants solutions...and good ones.<p>Political stances are always under a lot of scrutiny from the university professors and media networks. So if the general public cannot analyze and understand the full situation they will instead rely on and digest the consensus of the intellectual community.  I cannot see politicians (at least smart ones) worrying about having their their voters understanding their policies.  They have bigger fish to fry.  They have to be right, they have a record to defend, and they want to carry on a political career that can only advance with a record of retrospectively, good judgment.  Matthew Arnold put it best with, ""The freethinking of one age is the common sense of the next.""",1225432911

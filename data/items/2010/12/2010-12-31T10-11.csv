2055124,comment,2054431,2054431,0,0,ilmarihei,,,"Looked at the code a bit and tried to see what gives with the 1D example. Conclusions: 2D arrays were fast in Chrome, slow in Minefield, 1D arrays were fast in Minefield, Minefield had a tendency to occasionally get pummeled by the GC in the write test, data layout matters even in JS, you should use get(x,y) instead of get([x,y]), counting downwards in loops only helps in making the code buggier.<p>Passing the pos coords as x,y instead of [x,y] halved the get/set runtimes.<p>The difference between data layout performance was around 30%-100%. That is, accessing [x][y] by iterating over x in the inner loop is a good deal slower than iterating over y in the inner loop. And vice versa for [y][x].<p>Arrays and typed arrays had roughly equal performance in this. On Minefield, typed arrays were 10-20% faster than initialized arrays and initialized arrays were faster to access than uninitialized arrays. Zeroing out an array was a good deal slower than relying on the zero-initialized nature of typed arrays.<p>On Minefield, a 1D array was 5x faster than a 2D array. On Chrome, a 1D array was 40% slower than a 2D array. The Minefield 1D array version was 60% faster than the Chrome 2D array.<p>Accessing closure variables was slightly faster than property access.<p>Typed arrays are easy to use: new Array(w<i>h) -> new Int8Array(w</i>h). if (type Int8Array == 'undefined') Int8Array = Array; gets you backwards compatibility for simple uses.",1293793085

Try to play any sport at a high level and miss a few trainings because you'd rather read a book at home. You'll get bad looks the first time, yelled at the second time and kicked out the third time.<p>(I'm not saying WoW is a sport, just to pre-empt a diversion in that direction).<p>What is morally superior about exercising an hour a day over playing WoW an hour a day, provided the lack of exercise doesn't make one dangerously obese or similar? Yet all rants like this one are based on that premise - 'I used to be such a loser, now I work out, I'm so much better than those WoW losers'. Usually from former players, too; just like former smokers are the most obnoxious about how awesome they are for quitting, the former WoW players seem to know something about self-righteousness, too.<p>Anyway, like anything, it's about moderation. If you play a couple of hours a week and don't let it take over your life, there's nothing wrong with it. I asked my girlfriend to set up the 'parental control' feature on my account, so I only got to play 4 hours a week. If anything, WoW at least lets you do that; I have yet to see the first skateboard or piano that has a lock like that, and there are many people who 'waste' (in the article's definition, not mine) much more than 4 hours a week on those.",1293792835

2055106,comment,2054992,2054992,0,0,Luyt,,,"I play WoW for five years now. When I started, I used to be an occasional player.  But when I hit level 60 (that was the highest level a few years ago) it was impossible to advance further without being in a regular raiding guild.  So I started hardcoring: obligatory raids from 19:00 to 23:30, each evening, five evenings per week. Lower attendance was not tolerated. And gathering/grinding materials for potions/powerups afterwards, util 01:00 or so. This took place in a few months around the summer of 2006.  The reward was worth it: access to all high-level content, epic items, and being member of the most succesful guild on the server. However, after a few months hardcoring like this, the game felt more and more like a boring job. One day I realized that with this playing style, I would quickly lose all interest in this game, which I didn't want, so I quit the guild (only hardcorers were allowed to stay in) and changed to a casual player, which I still am today.<p>I didn't want to quit altogether because there was so much more game content to check out (I enjoy the sights & sounds of WoW very much), and so many other classes to try. Up until then I played exclusively Holy Priest.<p>Blizzard must have somehow realized that players weren't able to get any further without hardcoring. The last years they have created more and more features for the casual player: the Dungeon Finder system, player-vs-player battlegrounds, cross-realm instances, other reward systems; all these have lessened the dependence on a guild.<p>I now sometimes fire up WoW, not everyday, and play a few hours.  I still like it, after all these years (and 3 expansion packs).",1293792389
2055105,comment,2054992,2054992,0,0,slyn,,,"eeeeehhh. As a very avid WoW player of some years now, I would say WoW is something that can easily be something that holds your ""life progress"" or whatever you want to call it back, but it can also just as easily be played at a successful level (define that however you like) without that effect as well.<p>In the guild I'm in now and a guild I was in in the past I see both: players who are quite literally on welfare or unemployment and just play WoW and other games all day (colloquially ""living the dream"", mostly tongue-in-cheek), while others have what I would consider successful lives. One of our best priests works as some sort of company programmer or server maintainer/admin. Our best healing druid entered his first bodybuilding contest sometime in September of this year and plans on doing another next August iirc. Our guild/raid leader has an office 9-5 selling toys to retailers or something like that. Lots are in college, myself included. An old guild officer of mine was a Googler. A decent amount have wives/kids/gfs/main squeezes. etc.<p>I think the best argument of the post is the social obligations point. There are definitely some people who do ""no-life"" for the guild and such, but again, I think this is a some do some don't thing (as well as being limited to basically people in guild leadership situations). For every guild leader or officer I know who hasn't left a dead-end guild because of a feeling of obligations to the guild, I probably know twice as many officers who did left anyways, and 3-4x as many raiders who did as well. Anecdotally speaking, I left a guild where I was probably next in line to be guild/raid lead for a much better one, and am now debating doing some sort of ESL teach/travel program next year despite having been an officer in my new guild for roughly 6 months now.",1293792369

You would find it surprising that the worst hit states are those where agriculture is more industrialized than others.<p>In the name of import reforms, the quality requirements for imported seeds have been drastically lowered. Traditionally germination rates of seeds used to be tightly regulated and the farmers expected that they would be able to re-use part of the harvest as seeds. Lack of mandatory seed quality designation is a problem. Earlier the mandated germination rates were higher than 90% for much of the GM seeds it is 65%, and more expensive.<p>The market has been flooded with GM seeds with poor germination rates, higher input costs, no re-usability and lacking the pest resistance that was promised. You would find a high correlation with the suicide patterns and introduction of GM varieties like BT cotton.<p>The agriculture sector used to be served well by the (national and state) banks. That credit has almost but completely disappeared, by way of change in government policy. On the other hand, in Indian cities it is common to be spammed on your cell-phone by banks continuously, for loans that you do not want or need. Same goes for advertisements on TV. So one major factor is mis-allocation of credit. For the banks it makes sense because there is more profit to be made of (defaulting) car loans than loans to agricultural enterprises. With no banks offering loans the farmers usually turn to private money lenders who charge arbitrary and astronomical interests. Most of the lending related suicides have their source here.<p>The sad part is that this is a decade old phenomena and the average urban Indian has been unaware of it (partly by choice). The popular media did not report it. The movie ""Peepli Live"" has given the issue much needed visibility.<p>If anyone is interested a very good resource with analysis and yearly trends etc. is

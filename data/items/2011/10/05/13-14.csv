In Linux, you can make pretty much everything be an fd: signals can be delivered over a descriptor (signalfd(2)), filesystem change notifications can be delivered over a descriptor (inotify(7)), and so on.  Everything ends up being something you can pass to select (or a variant), and so you don't really need to handle the different concepts in different ways: a modern Linux application reads from a bunch of fds and takes action based on what it receives.<p>Incidentally, this is node.js' model.",1317823164

It's possible Turing owned them but not in any significant way. Newman kept the papers. Then he tried to flog them for  million at Christies, couldn't, but somehow he or his supporters managed to convince the NHMF to give 200,000 GBP (along with 30k (?) or so funds raised elsewhere) for the papers.<p>It appears from all reports I've seen that there is literally nothing of significance that would be lost with the export of these papers. None of the Press, which all seems to be based on the writing of Gareth Halfacre, detailed what was special about the papers:<p>""The set includes articles which have been annotated by Newman, along with Max Newman's name inscribed in pencil in Turing's hand. Accompanying the set of offprints is the Newman household visitors book with several signatures of Turing, that of Turings mother and, of special significance to Bletchley Park, signatures of other wartime codebreaking giants.""\n[from <a href=""http://www.nhmf.org.uk/LatestNews/Pages/EleventhHourRescueofTuringCollection.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nhmf.org.uk/LatestNews/Pages/EleventhHourRescueof...</a>]<p>It seems the public were sold a lie. People thought the papers were Turings original notes and such when in fact he just wrote his friends name on the top.<p>The NHMF should now just take hi-res scans of the documents and sell them for whatever they can get.

No-one who has a 4 or a 4S is going to be annoyed that they guy with the cheap iPhone looks like he's got the same thing as they have.<p>That comes with the downside of making the cheaper model a slightly tougher sell - it's visibly ""old"" - but that's Apple protecting their key market, the high end stuff.<p>But it will be interesting to see how the cheap [1] 3GS performs commercially against more modern Android phones in the same price bracket. Will Apple's brand have people going ""wow, I can get an iPhone"" or will people be saying ""I don't want a two / three year old phone regardless of who makes it"".<p>Obviously the attitude will vary from person to person but it will be an interesting test of Apple's name value to see if it can give a boost to older hardware.[2]<p>[1] I say cheap not free as it's free on a relatively pricey contract.<p>[2] I'm not running the 3GS down - I have one in my pocket right now, it's my primary phone, just it is older hardware and I think over the next 12 months will begin to show it's age more and more.",1317822966

Seems like a reasonable inference.<p>This article predicts that in three to six months, that it will be more difficult to raise money.

After all the example of Italy (Bond markets demand high risk premiums, Italy announces much needed reforms, ECB buys Italian bonds, Italy removes reforms) is quite telling. The same (much worse, actually) applies to the financial institutions. What precedent have we set by bailing almost all of the out. Without a lot of reform investors will no doubt assume that financial institutions are state-guaranteed, allowing them to continue the tails I win, heads you (the state, taxpayers) loose game.

You may have noticed the keyhole before in an elevator car; it is typically located near the floor selection panel. It is primarily used by firefighter's or emergency personnel, in order to take control of the elevators.<p>Next, imagine a hypothetical elevator situation. The elevator is in normal operation mode. You step into an empty elevator car at floor 1, and you select floor 14 as your destination. Someone else enters the elevator car with you, and selects floor 3 as the destination. Now, floor 3 and floor 14 have been selected and are illuminated on the floor selection panel.<p>Assuming no other factors, the elevator car stops at floor 3, the doors automatically open, and the person that selected floor 3 steps out. But wait... you decide to step out too, because you need to hit the restroom. As it turns out, no one is entering the elevator car that you and the passenger just exited at floor 3. The elevator car is now empty.<p>What happens now?<p>The doors automatically close. No one is on board the elevator car that you just exited, and floor 14 is still selected. This is immutable; assuming no other factors, the elevator car will eventually make it to floor 14, or be stopped by other passengers that are waiting for that elevator car before it gets there. In either case, the elevator car is out of your control.<p>Now, think of it from a firefighter's perspective. A firefighter does not want to be in a scenario where the elevator car is capable of leaving a floor, without his or her express command, regardless of whether the elevator car is being called by someone else, or if a floor has been selected and no one is in the elevator car.<p>This is what the door close button is for when an elevator is in emergency operation mode. In this mode, the desired floor is selected, then <i>the door close button must be fully engaged and held until the elevator car begins to move.</i> If the door close button is released before the elevator car begins to move, the doors will automatically open, and the elevator car will remain on the current floor.<p>In emergency operation mode, when an elevator car arrives at the selected floor, the doors will not automatically open. <i>The open door button must be fully engaged and held in order for the doors to fully open.</i> If the open door button is released before the doors are fully opened, the doors will automatically close. This functionality is designed to allow a firefighter to partially open the doors in order to assess a situation (e.g., fire, smoke, etc.), again, at his or her express command. Otherwise, the doors would automatically open fully, potentially exposing the firefighter to flames, or quickly filling the elevator car with smoke.",1317819950

You can sort-of get away with it when you sell at brick-and-mortar stores, but digital distribution should cut the costs dramatically. Instead, you have to pay $60 to get a game on digital distribution when it comes out. That's why I wait for Steam sales. Occasionally great games that came out a year ago are on sale for a reasonable price.",1317819799

As a result, you can't look at the fact that deployed capital currently exceed AUM and conclude that somehow the trend will continue.  I fully expect VC firms to raise more money as there are more investible opportunities.<p>To put it concretely, there is a state of the world in which VC firms leverage up (at very low rates), reducing the amount of money they need to accept upfront.  Imagine that the firms arranged for a 2x leverage scenario.  Then, they would only need about 7.2 B to service the 14.3B investment, much less than the 8.1 B invested<p>And as far as market moves are concerned, the fact that even smart money is getting slammed in the market moves suggests that most asset classes are poor short-term investments.

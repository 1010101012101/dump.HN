833616,comment,832255,833456,0,0,skolor,,,"Right-o. That requires, first, for you to plant a tree first, to remove carbon from the atmosphere and put it into a short term storage.<p>Now, IANAE, but from what I know the threat of global warming is that it comes with a cascade effect, that as it becomes more of a problem, the natural systems in place start giving way, making it become more of a problem faster (For example, as glaciers and ice fields melt, they release carbon and other gasses that had been locked in the ice, causing more warming). Doing something, <i>anything</i> to put that on hold sounds like a good idea to me.<p>Planting trees may not be the end-all solution to global warming, but it is the best Phase-1 of a long term reduction of carbon in the atmosphere that we have right now. You agree there isn't a current way to go from carbon in atmosphere-> carbon in long term storage (except for the ""fake tree"" thing, which simply shoves it into depleted oil deposits, which I think is a <i>terrible</i> idea).",1253483659

A random call to their cell phone is never welcome. Send an email.""</i><p>I disagree with this. For someone being approached a lot, like Arrington, it's obviously easier to give an e-mail a quick glance and then discard it instead of all the time and bother that comes with an almost cold call. But if you want to get through you should call, it's much harder to say no on the phone than it is to discard an e-mail from someone you don't know. You'll also have a much better chance of making an actionable next step. ""<i>so you like it? Well why don't I send you a mail with login information so you can give it a try?

This would be very odd in a multi-tiered organization, since often times development projects are decreed onto the programming staff by strategic direction committees. If no one cares, the project is make-work; warning. Either it is going to contribute next to no value to the organization, or no one has a clue what value it is going to contribute. Either way, you'll be hard pressed to convince everyone who needs to be convinced what you are doing is that valuable.<p>To borrow a PG idea, to everyone above you in the management hierarchy, you are represented -- as an aggregate of the rest of your group -- by either your lead or manager. A lot of the interaction between your group and the rest of the company will be done by them.

833587,comment,833287,833287,0,0,azanar,,,"Ugh. I severely dislike articles like this, because they lend legitimacy to a pay-by-politics form of reward and punishment.<p>Each of the three reasons he lists can be traced back to manipulation of one's political image: you fail to take the absolute most cynical view that everyone's failures from above will come crashing down on you, and cover your ass accordingly; you fail to wave your achievements around, because you believe someone is actively paying attention or gives a crap about anything you're doing; or you fail to appropriately hide your boredom and lack of motivation by plodding on at the same rate as everyone else like the good cog that you are.<p>None of these have anything to do with actually doing anything. You could be accomplishing next to nothing, and still be able to hit all of these points; you could be working miracles in code, and manage to flunk all three and get thrown out on your ass. They are all the departmental equivalent of spin control, and are the sign of a broken department and quite possibly a broken company. It is a sign that people have stopped caring about doing things in favor of appearing as though they are doing things. This sort of thing is a slow death of a thousand cuts to an organization, and will result in people getting fired anyway, when the lack of revenues from people not getting anything done force staffing cuts anyway.<p>I understand that a lot of companies are run like this; I don't need to be reminded about how the real world works, and especially not with the usual condescension. I'm not trying to convince myself or anyone else that the corporate world is not stacked this way; what I am doing is yelling in the same way Dan Pink did about motivation by incentive that this sort of ass-covering doesn't work. It results in an organization that will steadily decay from the inside, and will ultimately end up shafting the same people who thought they could save themselves by just hunkering down and playing the political game. All these people bought was a little more time cower in fear, and convince themselves this will all blow over if they just behave. It doesn't work, and people need to stop convincing themselves, for the sake of themselves, their coworkers, and the organizations they purport to work for, that it does.<p>Life is too short, peoples' time and effort is too valuable, to put up with asinine wealth tarpits like this. No one, not even the person cowering, is benefited in the long-term in any way by this sort of attitude.<p>Ugh, I need to go take a walk to unwind.",1253481947

We are on extended stay in the U.S., away from our home in Shanghai.  I wanted some Chinese comforts for my wife: tea, chopsticks, chinese cooking spices, rice noodles.  After some searching on the web, it looked like I could buy all these through Amazon.  I picked 4 different items from 4 different suppliers.  All items showed ""in stock, ships immediately"".  So I added them to my shopping cart and went to checkout.  I see a whopping and opaque 50% charge over the costs of goods for shipping, no shipping breakdown.

In the days following the purchase, I receive 4 different emails from each supplier, not Amazon, telling me various things about the item's true availability and when it should ship.

I just questioned whether they actually do provide more value by trading or if it just appears that way during a financial bubble.<p>Don't forget that the sole purpose of trading is to finance making. Trading has no intrinsic value. It's the bureaucracy of capitalism ;-)",1253480615

We released an album for free in April this year:<p><a href=""http://www.dynamo-go.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dynamo-go.com/</a><p>Drums were tracked in a pro studio using protools, then the rest of the album was recorded using Ardour and UbuntuStudio with LADSPA plugins.  The final master was done by somebody else using some other software.<p>We had done a couple of EPs and had been pretty unimpressed by the immense financial risks we had to take in order to get a distributor on board - having gone down that path previously and having had to work exceptionally hard just to recoup our investment, we released the full album for free, based on the fact that it involved zero upfront investment and lots more people would hear it.  It worked out pretty well.  It still gets half a dozen downloads a week, last time I checked my webserver stats.",1253480585

How does the content improve their lives - look smarter at a cocktail party, transform an otherwise mind-numbing train ride, decide what stock to buy, pick up a girl at a bar, break the ice at the beginning of a cold call with a sales prospect. What is all that worth?<p>Have publishers charged enough?  Has publisher marketing take advantage of this added value to generate more subscriptions? How much more value can be added with the  interactivity and immediacy of new technologies and how publishers harvest and use this information to convince consumers to pay more.<p>By the way, I wonder how many people told Steve Jobs that no one would pay for I-Tunes? I'd bet it was many.<p>Katherine Warman Kern \n@comradity",1253480545

Think about someone who have spent years to develop some innovative product: doesn't he/she deserve to make a profit from it?  Or is it better for some other people who are just smarter about business to make gobs of money over the effort of somebody else?",1293613176

People think it was unwise to refuse Google's offer, but Google's culture and track record regarding what need's to be done to make Groupon big make selling to Google the wrong decision.

I should have added to my comment that I meant most outsourced call-centers in which employees are nothing more than people to fill seats that either commit mischievous actions or make stupid mistakes. I have no quarrel with a call-center servicing people in the same language or high end call-centers in which people are either highly trained or only hired if they have the skill set required for a specific job.<p>There is also a call-center in my country that is dedicated to translation services. They are of course exempt of my contempt as they only hire translators with the capacity to translate from x language to english in a timely and concise manner. They offer pay that is considerably a lot higher than regular call-centers and they vet and test their employees before hiring. Once again I was targeting call-centers in India, Central America, and Africa that are full of thieves and morons. There are, of course, exceptions to the rule, but they are surely the minority.

Illegal downloading hasn't robbed the industry from profit, Avatar/Inception/The Dark Knight box office sales have disproven that. What has ended, is the business model of putting garbage inside a shiny mystery box that people have to pay for the opportunity to peek inside. Gone are the days of cd's that have one good song and fifteen filler tracks, movies that show their only worthwhile parts during the trailer leaving the story begging for a plot. Forget you Hollywood, I hope your industry suffers needlessly for years. The 'mystery box' business model only works when people can't preview the garbage inside",1293611982

Why do they insist on justifying stealing? I understand that, in this case, its the owners of the art saying it worked out for them. Generally though, just steal and shut up. Someone else (possibly an evil conglomerate) owns the work and they have every right to discard your economic theories. Sure, you can stick it to them, but, again, why justify it?<p>Is it because people don't think art should be owned?",1293611925

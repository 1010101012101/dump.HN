4991248,comment,4990950,4991096,1,0,dhimes,,,"My father had equally pragmatic rules about alcohol and drugs.  He made sure I was educated about the effects of drugs.  He made sure that I knew that my mind was pretty awesome and putting it at risk is stupid.  (He also knew that kids do such things- but try to be smart about it.)  He told me my grades had to stay up and I couldn't lose my job.  And he said that if the police came to the house and knew my name- if I was somehow involved enough in something and didn't have sense enough to get away- I would lose all of my freedom.  Guilty or not.  And if he ever caught me driving under the influence- the same.<p>I had a lot of freedom, and I made some mistakes, but overall it worked out.",1356994759

When religion is just that thing that forbids doing things that you don't want to do anyway (murder, steal, build a cow out of gold in your backyard, etc) it is easy to never bother putting any thought into it one way or the other.  But when you tell a teenage boy that his biologically hardwired desires are evil... there is a good chance that kid is going to start wondering what exactly the purpose of that rule is and how relevant it is to his own life.<p>It could go either way I think, but it is a very polarising thing to impose on a young adult.",1356994750

One not so good morning ages ago I was underway to an employer sponsored course in 'effective cobol' (whatever effective cobol is still eludes me to today, so I guess the course wasn't all that effective). A car cut me off on a green light for me straight ahead by turning right into my path going as fast as I could to try to catch my train in time (cycle to my dads house across the city, drop off the bike there, take the subway to the train station and then the train to Utrecht, miss the connection and be a half hour late). I braked, much too hard on the front trying to avoid becoming hamburger, the rear of the bike left the pavement and because of my clips was attached pretty good to the rest of me. I smacked to the pavement with the bike landing on top of me. I didn't really realize how badly I was hurt until the receptionist in the place where I was going came close to fainting when I walked in, my whole face covered in blood and scratches from the impact everywhere where skin was exposed. If not for the dumb toeclips I'd have been much more in control of the fall and it likely would not have ended as bad as it did. Since then no more toeclips for me.<p>I hope your emergency will continue to be in your future, unfortunately mine caught up with me. After I stopped using toeclips I went as fast as before, even did emergency stops a couple of times, including another front wheel flip (and with those new disc brakes that's even easier now than before) but nothing ever came close to the time when I was strapped to the bike.<p>The one good thing about the bike falling on me was that I was pretty poor at the time and the bike didn't have any damage ;)",1356994593

What usually happens is 1 drive fails. The raid then goes into degraded mode and continues to function. Nobody notices the warnings. Some time later... months or years even, a second drive fails, the raid goes down - now they notice. They call in the techs who declare 'two drives failed'. This is when your data is most at risk. People start swapping boards and drives, repower the system, rebuild drives, rebuild parity, force stale drives online etc. I have seen alot of raids that would have been recoverable had they done the proper steps. Then they hand it over and say they found it this way... didn't touch a thing...

4991236,comment,4990950,4990950,1,0,cheald,,,"A 13-year-old is not an adult. The fact that the mom is giving her 13-year-old a $600 piece of hardware at <i>all</i> obviously means that she trusts him with some degree of responsibility. An internet-connected pocket computer is a very powerful device, and it'd be ridiculously irresponsible of her to <i>not</i> set out some kind of guidelines that helps to ensure that he uses it responsibly and ""inside the rules"".<p>It's called parenting. A 13-year-old is not an adult, and does not have the maturity of an adult. Even if her rules aren't something that you or I would personally agree with, good on her for entrusting him with a large responsibility and setting out the guidelines for that responsibility. It is her duty as a parent to do exactly this - to trust her children with progressively more responsibility and freedom, but to also set hard-and-fast boundaries that shall not be crossed.<p>I like to say ""I was such a good parent before I had kids"". Parenting is all nice and neat and easy until you actually have to do it. It's really easy to armchair quarterback this one, but I'm pretty certain that anyone without kids is wholly unqualified to pass judgment on this one.",1356994562

Our parents didn't know how to use that thing in majority of cases. But we turned out fine. There was unfettered access to porn. Then things like FB/Twitter came where we were putting ourselves (and lot of intimate details) on digital shelves that would never be cleared. Yet, we all turned okay. Agreed, there were occasional mishaps with someone we know. But given the reach of Internet, we all turned quite well. I believe all of us had strong moralistic values that were imbued in us right from childhood. And those values turned out okay for Internet age too.<p>As someone who doesn't have kid, it will be stupid to pass judgement/opinion on her letter. May be I will be doing same thing since I will be older and worried about safety as well as well being of my child. However, when I was a kid, I remember whenever parents told us strict no for something, I itched to do it (unless it was something extreme). Just out of curiosity.

4991218,comment,4987467,4990844,1,0,kierank,,,"First of all thats a lovely ad hominem based on absolutely zero knowledge of the projects I have worked on. I have led teams for Pay-TV deployments on satellite and OTA with budgets orders of magnitude larger than any live streaming package and deployed hundreds of television channels. Of course you make the same claim again which Ive had time after time from engineers like Microsoft, Google etc who think web is the be-all and end-all. I use the following technical arguments each time to bring these guys back to earth.<p>First of all you totally ignore the point I made about high bandwidth usage affecting the viewing experience. Do you really want to sit there on Patch Tuesday waiting for the video on your TV to buffer because your PC in the other room is downloading updates? At best youll see huge quality fluctuations as the adaptive streaming tries to react. At worst youll miss the goal waiting for the stream to buffer. A managed network gives you a similar broadcast experience to licensed RF spectrum.<p>All the web services offering HD are based around a simple concept  you can get acceptable quality at web bitrates when youre delivering p24 content with buffer times of around 5-10 seconds (the usual chunk length in an adaptive streaming system), which gives you a huge VBV to work with and a huge keyframe interval. Contrast this with broadcast and its ~0.5-2 second channel change times. Good luck convincing users to wait 5-10 seconds to change the channel (channel-surfing is part of a television experience). The fact is to deliver p50/60 content for sports you need significantly higher bitrates than web bitrates  with current bitrates youre just watching blocks all day because of the necessary smaller keyframe intervals and VBV. It is nowhere near to a sports offering that people are paying the equivalent of a cable subscription for - even more so on a larger screen. That doesnt even take into consideration the poor quality of web encoders.<p>Overall latency is nowhere near television-like. Web streams are 30s to 1 minute delayed compared to television streams thanks to CDN buffering and adaptive streaming chunks. Different viewers in a household end up getting streams that are hugely out of phase (demonstrated during the Olympics where a race on one stream hadnt even started when it had finished on another). Your neighbours have already finished celebrating the goal by the time you see it.
The technology to deliver web streams to relatively small numbers of users has been around but once you get to large numbers the capacity is not there  its one reason adaptive streaming is useful; once your ISP runs out of capacity you can be adaptively streamed to a low bitrate but still get a picture. In my city (Bristol, UK) on cable, YouTube interconnects are congested and only 240p works as result.<p>Its no surprise live streaming OTT is provided as an add-on to Pay-TV  operators know it isnt good enough yet to charge for as a standalone package. Some operators <i>are</i> going to use streaming to deliver their channels because of problems with multicast but theyll be able to use DiffServ to maintain a decent experience.",1356994095

I'm confident that most people have the ability to make something good enough to justify a $100 fee, it's just that they don't have a reason to try hard enough.<p>> ""The problem with fear that I've found, is that it only pushes you to slightly outrun that fear...""<p>This is a great point - in fact, when I was first starting out I was often ready to be done with projects. They were stressful! But they taught me skills that I don't think I'd have learned otherwise, that I could have more casual, curiosity-driven fun with later. I doubt anyone would put themselves in a stressful situation like that unless they had some genuine curiosity. It didn't permanently scar me. It just was an accelerator, like taking off the training wheels.  Stressful and scary but a necessary push forward to learn faster and stretch myself.",1356993673
4991194,comment,4989952,4989952,6,0,sridharvembu,,,"Let me add my perspective as an Indian living in the SF bay area, spending about 20-25% of my time in India. The poverty of India is inescapable, it is everywhere around you. The reason I got into business, particularly business in India, ultimately is that in my mid-20's I found myself simply very depressed about this, and decided that business was the only way I could make a real difference. I was inspired by the examples of Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan and similar places, which went from miserable third world poverty to middle income prosperity within about 30 years.<p>About charity, in the here and now, when you are surrounded by such need that you see all around you in India (I personally know hundreds of stories), small and local acts of charity are very necessary and helpful.<p>At the same time, I do not believe that charity can work on any kind of large scale. First, given the vastness and diversity of India, it is impossible for any one person to know more than a small fraction of India. With that said, I firmly believe that the part of India that I am familiar with - the Southern part accounting for about 25% of Indian population - could have been a Taiwan or South Korea or Southern China, if only the Indian government had pursued a relatively sane economic policy. No I am not complaining about corruption and so on - South Korea or China did not develop because they had enlightened, corruption-free governments. Even today, Indian economic policy is miserably wrong-headed. It hurts the very poor the most, but our political class is simply oblivious to it.<p>One example would suffice: today, the second largest textile exporter in the world, after China, is Bangladesh. With all the political turmoil, corrupt government and so on, Bangladesh has made more progress in lifting its poorest citizens than India, and the 3 million textile industry jobs are a primary reason. Why couldn't India do it? Policy, in one word. Textile industry is the classic climb-the-ladder industry. China is just about ready to vacate the lowest rungs of the ladder, and Bangladesh is getting on it. India's poorest are still waiting.<p>To summarize, I believe in charity-in-the-small, in the here and now, but large scale economic development, lifting hundreds of millions of poverty in India (which accounts for most of the world's poor) needs something different.",1356993637

</code></pre>
I'd highly disagree on this. The minute someone offers some sort of compensation for work, the dynamic of the relationship changes -- from helper to employee (and in some cases servant) -- especially at the low-ball prices. From what I've found, the people thinking a website can be built for $100 are the type of people who will bug you as to why it's not done, demand extra features, wonder why it doesn't look like {{insert_dynamic_million_dollar_website_here}}, etc. And if you are just starting out, you probably don't have much contracting experience to have contracts ready with expectations of work/time to commit/deadlines/etc.<p>The best solution I found when I wanted to learn to code was that I had something I wanted to create that I couldn't -- not anything huge, just something small. Once I got it up and working, I had so many questions -- ""why did it do that?"", ""why didn't it work?"", ""what if I wanted to do X?"", and that fueled me to find out more information so I could answer those questions.<p>I also disagree that ""we have to create a context where we have no choice but to learn."" What people need, instead, is to bring back our child sense of curiosity. When I was reading up on the fiscal cliff, I was confused -- why were we in this mess? Why couldn't we do X, Y, Z? If you are overwhelmed with questions, many will just quit, feeling the answers are too insurmountable. The trick is to ask just enough questions so that you can understand a slightly larger view of the puzzle, which will help you answer the next set of questions.",1356991971

Once you're out of school, there is no one to set goals for you. Even assuming you do have goals, there are no structured classes or textbooks to get you to those goals with your eyes closed. You are essentially both the teacher and the pupil and you must figure out your own curriculum in addition to doing the learning.",1356991453

The best way to describe them, at least for me, is something like having your own personal charitable foundation, but without the overhead ( * there are significant legal and operational differences between a donor assisted fund and a charitable foundation, but I won't go into that here ).<p>The process went like this: I set up a fund thru the Vanguard Charitable Endowment Program and mailed in a check for $25,000 ( minimum amount to open a fund. ) to start things off. This money no longer belongs to me, but I can recommend grants to public charities as well as direct how the money should be invested while it is waiting to be distributed as a grant. I put half of my fund in short term/cash investments so money will be there for grants I want to make in the short-term and the other half in a stock fund to hopefully appreciate over the course of years, so my giving a decade from now can benefit.<p>Rather than writing checks to different charities throughout the year, tracking each contribution, and hoping the charity sends me a letter confirming I donated, I make one donation at the end of each year directly to my fund. Going forward, I can make all my grants to public charity through my fund online. On my federal return, I only have to specify the single donation to my fund without having to worry about collecting proof of donations from all the individual charities to which I contribute.<p>I'm really excited about this and I am looking forward to figuring out where my fund could do the most good. I do not have a specific focus of where I want to contribute. I have a few charities I have supported over the years, but I would really like to expand and find some charities encouraging technical education to under-privileged youth. I would particularly like organizations where a small grant $100-$1000 goes a long way. Any thoughts Hacker News?",1356991381

4991073,comment,4989952,4990193,3,0,zt,,,"Well, we can disagree whether moving a little farther west is really the underpinning idea in US governance. I think that question was basically settled in the Whiskey Rebellion: there was never some idyllic period of liberty in American history where the government just was not on people's back.<p>Developers and entrepreneurs seem to too often live under this false notion that just because they can build things easily--literally our whole lives have been animated by the fact that we can just make a computer do nearly whatever we want--that somehow that is true for everyone in our society. A world with perfect liberty is a naturally unequal one--and the government can do a lot that is not telling ""us what to do"" that can address the worst examples of the inequity with a smaller proportionate decrease in overall liberty.<p>But, I digress in to the deepest and most fundamental question in western political philosophy, so let me move on to simply say what's below.<p>The federal government exists. It has immense powers. State and local governments exist. They have immense powers. Those things are not changing in our society any time soon (even with sequestration).<p>Given that fact, I think we're presented with two choices. We can either try to make government work better or we can ignore it. Either way it exists and affects our lives. I, for one, think it might be better if people like the folks on HN (libertarians, liberals, and everyone else) took part in the rule-making, the regulation, the laws, and the services that come out of our government. That we made sure that the folks who opine on the future of the internet were at least cursorily aware of its functioning, etc.",1356991324

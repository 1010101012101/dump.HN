It's just that governments are unique institutions in that they reserve for themselves a virtual monopoly on the use of force, and most of what they do is not optional.  I believe that <i>most</i> of the good part of what comes from government as we know it today can be achieved through people choosing, voluntarily, to work together.  The difference would be that the various communes and collectives that libertarians talk about, would not be able to mandate participation at the point of a gun barrel.<p><i>And you don't see the damage caused by businesses and private individuals independently from and/or in the absence of government?</i><p>I see certain individuals and/or businesses causing harm even in the face of government as we know it today.  I'm not convinced that the situation would be considerably worse under a libertarian model, and - more to the point - I believe that freedom is it's own end, and justifies whatever negative consequences arise from it.<p>I guess it's hard to explain to anybody who isn't a libertarian, but people like us <i>feel</i> the whole ""live free or die"" thing, and just absolutely recoil at being denied the freedom to live without the constant interjection of coercive force / aggression into our lives.

I used to use Digg like crazy back in the day, and then about 2 or 3 months before Digg 4 (it was 4, not 3, right?) I jumped ship to reddit. Reddit seemed to have much better content, much better conversations, and was more relevant to my technical interests. Digg had started that way, but soon became hype stories / drama / memes / cat pictures. After having used reddit for about 1.5 years, I discovered hacker news. After reading hn for a bit, it started to become obvious that reddit was starting to feel like Digg did before I left. Nothing but memes / complaining / cat pictures / look at what my (girlfriend / kid / cat did) / lol science is cool kind of stuff. I image that over time the same thing will happen here, and is probably happening right now. Enjoy it while it lasts I suppose!",1338335600

4040616,comment,4040022,4040022,50,0,btilly,,,"This is thought-provoking, which is good.  However there are significant issues with the approach.<p>1. Real world performance varies over time.  For instance there are typically daily, weekly and monthly conversion rate fluctuations.  Not an issue for A/B testing, but a big issue for this approach if a random switch in direction happens at the same time that conversion fluctuations happen to head in a good direction.<p>2. (This is really a special case of #1 - but a very, very important special case.)  This approach creates long-lasting interaction effects between tests and independent changes.  That requires explanation.  Suppose you're running a test.  Version A is somewhat better.  But version B is temporarily looking slightly better when you make a significant improvement to your website (maybe you started another test that works).  Now you're adding a lot of good traffic to version B (good because of the other change) and very little of the new good traffic to version A.  This new version B traffic soundly beats your old version A traffic.  This correlation between time and website performance will continue until the old version A traffic is completely swamped by new version A traffic.  With only 5% of your traffic going to version A, this can easily take 100x as long as your test has been running - or more.  (Properly constructed A/B tests do not suffer this statistical anomaly.)<p>3. Code over time gets messy.  One of the most important characteristics of A/B testing is that you can delete the mess and move on.  With this approach you can't - it just hangs around adding to your technical debt.<p>4. Businesses are complex, and often have multiple measures they would like to balance.  For instance in a recent test, conversion to click was hurt, conversion to a person who clicked 5x was helped.  A/B testing let us notice that something weird was going on and think about what we really cared about.  This automated approach would make a decision and could have hidden a real problem.<p>5. Many tests perform differently on existing users and new users.  A/B testing with proper cohort analysis can let you tease this out and decide accordingly.  This approach doesn't give you that kind of sophistication.",1338335576

Bandit optimization is a useful tool, but it has drawbacks, and it's not <i>always</i> better than A/B testing.  In particular, bandit approaches take longer to converge (on average), and don't give you reliable ways to know when to stop testing (when all you know is that you're using an approach that's optimal in the limit of a large N, your only guarantee is that things get better as N gets large).  These techniques also make assumptions that aren't valid for a lot of web experiments:  identical ""bandit"" distributions that are constant over time.  Throw a few choices that are optimal at different times of day/week/month/year at a bandit optimizer, and it'll just happily fluctuate between them.<p>Also, there's a lot of variation in performance depending on the parameters of your test -- some of which are completely unknowable.  So if you want to really learn about this method, you need to read more than a blog post where the author has concluded that bandit optimization is the new pink.  For example, here's a pretty readable paper that does an empirical analysis of the various popular bandit algorithms in different paramterizations:<p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:KgmC8CnPhxwJ:www.cs.mcgill.ca/~vkules/bandits.pdf+&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESjCXEToqqEjlrUIYeKyWtVpgBe4edd4wNeBoFqsTouBIiwPSoAIqP4iZCWXZeygjkzhchKEm6lZYwhCY3RMtg2JrD4Zr9Cge6IO9QH9QZ1Lx25Ee5H8OEHOAb2I0g5Z2NpWwe7P&sig=AHIEtbSqosRQf7c82ZCcUOXYgSo0QJ2IJw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:KgmC8CnPhxwJ:...</a><p>This is just one article, but there's tons of literature on this problem.

I guess with a value of $1500 per conversion, you can afford to spend liberally on adwords to catch users as they are searching, but I suspect the words in that space are competitive and expensive.

Check out the reviews at Amazon.<p>[1] My story:  I started programming at the age of 11 when my father gifted me a computer, and its manual.

During birth, babies are exposed to their mother&#x27;s vaginal fluid which then transfers bacteria into the baby&#x27;s mouth. This transfer introduces a nice bacterial balance and makes it more difficult for a single species of bacteria to monopolize the mouth and digestive system.

6632077,comment,6631499,6631954,9,0,nostrademons,,,"I think that what you&#x27;re seeing is the effect of design coherency on a product.  You are generally far better off having one barely-trained designer put together a product than a dozen best-of-class designers.  Why?  Because a product designed by one inexperienced person will at least be <i>consistent</i>.  They have their overall vision of what they want to achieve, and they can make trade-offs appropriately.<p>When you have dozens of designers that all want to leave their mark on the product, you end up with...dozens of features, none of which fit together quite right.  Google is in that state right now.  Microsoft is in a far worse state, where you have <i>hundreds</i> of PMs that each want to display their button as prominently as possible.  This is what people make fun of as &quot;design by committee&quot;.<p>Until 2010, Marissa was the sole gatekeeper of what could go onto the search results page.  The result was that it was at least consistent, if minimalist and relatively unchanging.  The other result was that she pissed off a whole bunch of other people by saying &quot;no&quot;, brought Search to a virtual logjam, and made numerous talented people quit.  That&#x27;s the price of design consistency and a highly usable product for users; everyone who&#x27;s <i>not</i> calling the shots ends up pretty disenchanted, and usually finds greener pastures.  Steve Jobs played an analogous role at Apple Computer - it worked great while he was alive, but now there is a design vacuum that you&#x27;re starting to see in their later products.<p>BTW, if you want to see what some of Google&#x27;s design talent can do when freed from committees, check out the Doodles.  In general there is just one artist responsible for each individual doodle, and it shows.  (Some of the interactive ones have multiple people involved, but even then it&#x27;s a small team with a single creative lead.)

React is fairly self-contained and only attempts to provide the view layer, not the model or controller (or however you choose to structure your code). Frankly, that&#x27;s one of the biggest reasons that we are able to use it at KA: it&#x27;s easy to adopt into an existing codebase and you can use it alongside whichever libraries you&#x27;re already using.<p>Ember and Angular both try to own the entire (frontend) stack, which can work well but usually only if you&#x27;re building a new app from scratch. In fact, there&#x27;s been some brief discussion in the React IRC channel about possibly making an easy way to use React views instead of Handlebars inside an Ember app.<p>Angular has its own share of problems.

Angular inundates you with new concepts and confusing vocabulary (e.g., transclusion) and makes it hard to write &quot;directives&quot; (their reusable components), while React&#x27;s bread and butter is making reusable components and because it&#x27;s so focused, it does it well.",1383021350

What this means is that you have a multipath problem; the original sound can come through the whole window (even the wall!) but the canceling sound can only eminate from the speaker.<p>If you draw a straight line from the original noise source, through the device and from there it happens to head towards your ears, this can work.  If not things will get jumbled up and it might cancel or it might actually reinforce the noise, rather than cancelling it.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudspeaker#Directivity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudspeaker#Directivity</a><p>Physics<p>A speaker is a device that works as a derivative of the original signal.  That means it needs some amount of &quot;advance notice&quot; of the sound in order to be able to create the proper pressure wave to cancel out said sound.  The &quot;advance notice&quot; is usually done by means of some distance between the microphone and the speaker but the device is very thin.  Worse, the amount of &quot;advance notice&quot; depends on the frequency of the sound which generally makes it an intractable problem to solve for the transient case.<p><a href=""http://www.customanalogue.com/elsinore/elsinore_19.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.customanalogue.com/elsinore/elsinore_19.htm</a><p>So what people do is focus on periodic noises like hum, hiss, buzz, rumble, what-have-you.  In this case you don&#x27;t need to make sure that any one peak has it&#x27;s inverse reproduced perfectly, you only have to ensure that ONE peak is cancelled out by SOME OTHER out of phase peak.  If it takes a couple of cycles for the computer to catch on, no big deal that&#x27;s just a bit of start-up noise.

This requires a lot of sophisticated analysis, but has turned rather vacuous.  And much conventional applied statistics consists of computing diagnostics based on dubious modeling assumptions.  Under pressure in the last 20 or so years from computer science, machine learning, computer vision, Moore&#x27;s law, and the data avalanche, the discipline has changed, but not fast enough.<p>As a result, a lot of what <i>should</i> be taught and researched in statistics departments has been co-opted by these other disciplines.  And many people with a real problem would rather work with a &quot;machine learning&quot; person than a &quot;statistics&quot; person.<p>The best summary of this state of affairs is Leo Breiman&#x27;s essay (<a href=""http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?handle=euclid.ss/1009213726&view=body&content-type=pdf_1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?ha...</a>).  The abstract of this essay is brutal:<p>&quot;There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model.  The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown.  The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large, complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.&quot;<p>Breiman was mathematically sophisticated, so it&#x27;s not that he wasn&#x27;t able to follow the theory he critiques, it&#x27;s that he wasn&#x27;t snowed by detail and could see its lack of relevance to real problems.",1383020764

In my experience, all of the time gains you realize from using a framework early on are lost (and then some) trying to get it to do that last 10% that you need.<p>Ultimately I&#x27;ve found that using vanilla Javascript offers everything I need to just &quot;get things done&quot; and complete a project successfully.  Sure, I might not be able to get something out the door in a day.  But at the end of the project I&#x27;ve delivered clean, maintainable code on time.  And anyone who knows Javascript will be able to read it.<p>Now, lest you think I&#x27;m a complete framework hater; they have their place.  They&#x27;re great at prototyping, for example.  But never again will I build an entire project on one.  I have little interest in being a glorified glue stick, piecing framework code together.  How boring.<p>I should add that I make heavy use of libraries like jQuery and Underscore.  They&#x27;re libraries, not frameworks.  Take what you need with them yet still reasonably lightweight.  Frameworks are bloated, tightly-coupled, poorly documented monstrosities in my opinion.",1383020499

Maybe I&#x27;ve misunderstood you.<p>The function of a peer reviewed publication is to formalize and verify that some result is correct, reproducible, and relevant (and to advance tenure). One would hope that whether you publish or not is mostly orthogonal to <i>how</i> you conduct your work. If you&#x27;re doing data analysis in any professional capacity, you should be using mathematically sound techniques, <i>and you should understand those techniques</i>. There&#x27;s no other way about it. I&#x27;m not sure what your line of work is, but I can&#x27;t think of any technical field where one&#x27;s analysis techniques being &quot;scientifically sound&quot; is anything but paramount. Why else would the work have any value? Perhaps it helps to think about publishing your work to be more like deploying your code, rather than testing it.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say that every step of the way you have to conduct yourself with the utmost rigor. It doesn&#x27;t mean that you must prove every theorem each time you use it, nor that you have to be laying out strict tests and hypotheses every time you load a data set. But to do data analysis in a scientifically sound manner <i>does</i> mean that you have to understand the background of the techniques you&#x27;re using, and how they apply to your data. It <i>does</i> mean that you have to periodically bring your analysis back to basics and make sure your ducks are still in a row; that you haven&#x27;t fallen off the assumption wagon somewhere along the line. It <i>does</i> mean that you should know why something is working, or why something is broken, not just that it is.<p>&quot;Statisticians&quot; don&#x27;t sit around all day laying out hypothesis tests in latex. They do the same thing you do; they fire up R, load the data and start playing with it. It&#x27;s all about the context you have in your brain when you are playing with it. This, I think, is where the formal training becomes quite important. Because as with most things, it&#x27;s the <i>unknown</i> unknowns that will destroy you, and having the broad formal foundation gives you the tools to protect yourself from walking into a minefield problems you didn&#x27;t even know existed yet.",1383019502

What is there for him to do at this stage, expect from alerting Apple on this?<p>2. Again, why not do proper customer service and give the user some opportunity to have his issue addressed ? Like, a simple message &quot;please call the Apple customer service etc.&quot; instead of wiping his message completely.<p>This is very much symptomatic of Apple which wants to keep every issue under the rug and never admit they did anything wrong. Jobs was very much like that: never admitting any mistake, always saying that the product coming out was always &quot;better&quot; but never saying &quot;we screwed up on this or this&quot; when they did.",1383019290

Yes there are outliers here and there, but for the most part, I can bet 70%+ of the people reading this are as follows: if you are Asian, I bet most of your good friends are Asian, if you white, then most of your good friends are white, and so on and so forth. It&#x27;s not racism, it&#x27;s just human nature that starts early on. If you grew up in America you know what I&#x27;m talking about, ever notice how young kids including yourself start naturally forming groups late in elementary school? if not then definitely around middle school. Whites hang out with the whites, Asians hang out with the Asians, Latinos w/ Latinos, blacks w/ blacks, etc..",1383019213

409588,comment,408786,409123,0,0,davidw,,,"Ok, I think you are really on to something with the ""it's impossible to calculate things"" (the economic calculation problem postulated by some Austrian economists in the 30ies and 40ies), but where I split from the libertarians is that I don't think that means we should throw up our hands in the air and do nothing at all ""gosh, it's too complicated!"", but do the most direct, least invasive things to solve those problems that do need to be solved collectively.  For instance, I think schools ought to be available to everyone, so that no matter who you are born, you have the means to become who you want.  And that doesn't mean ""just let the free market do it"".  I think introducing some market mechanisms might make sense - lessening the power of the teachers' unions and giving more money to good teachers - but I very strongly believe that even though most of our economy ought to be decided by a free market, not <i>all</i> of it should.  I think that lack of simplicity grates on a lot of nerd/geek types who want a clean, simple, beautiful rule that will make everything work.  However, people are messy, complex, contradictory creatures that don't function in a world of black and white.<p>If I'm not mistaken, this is similar to the Warren Buffet view of the economy: yeah, get the government out of the market where it makes sense, let the market do its work, but then whoever wins needs to share some of that with the poorest in our society.",1230216568

409585,comment,409075,409393,0,0,ph0rque,,,"I understand your concern, but there's a key difference between reddit and HN: one is general news the  other--hacker news. So you should really be comparing reddit to CNN or other mainstream news organizations. In that sense, I think reddit is still a better source, even if it is very biased.<p>My initial point was: we shouldn't call a particular story redditlike as a catch-all Bad Thing(tm).",1230215472

As much as I hate the Windows tax, it is a little consoling to think that some of it is being put to good use.",1230213826

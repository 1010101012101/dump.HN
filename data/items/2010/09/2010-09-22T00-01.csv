If you host the JS on your own, your site becomes slow only if <i>your server</i> hangs. However, if you host the JS somewhere else, your site becomes slow whenever <i>your server or the other server</i> hangs. The probability of the latter is always greater than the former, i.e. you don't really gain anything.<p>So this trick slightly improves the good cases, but increases the likelihood of the bad cases. That kind of trade-off isn't desirable. Usually, people design trade-offs for the exact opposite: scarifying the speed of the normal case (which should be more than fast enough anyway) in order to decrease the probability of the worst case.<p>(BTW, this is true for almost all long-living projects. The opposite strategy makes only sense in ""car racing"" like situations where you either win fast, or lose everything. However, hardly any website is designed to live only a few weeks or so.)",1285116625

I have never failed to do this.<p>Why?  Because if someone has spent an hour of their time (I don't care if it's on company time) to potentially change my life, the least I could do is take 5 minutes to share a sincere Thank You.  I always take the time to hand write it, I always make it personal, and I am always sincere.

I do it because it's the right thing to do.  It is never ""annoying"" or a ""detriment"".  Almost everyone I have ever sent a hand written note has told me that they really appreciated opening it and reading it.<p>Sometimes I even take it a step further.  Several times, I have asked public speakers what their favorite restaurant is, and then sent a gift card in the Thank You note.  I really want them to understand what a difference their contribution has made in at least one attendee's life.  The gift card is a nice idea because I know they will use it and enjoy it, and maybe even think of me that night.

But for the mobile app (we just finished the first prototype - without beutification and such) we used ""my"" in almost every case... and we investigated why: For us it feels convenient that if I hold my cell in my hand, it is MY phone.. and such is the mobile apps that I use. They are MY apps, and as MY apps, they are a part of me (I take them with me everywhere I go - just like my keys).

It's a somewhat flawed analogy though, if you have 6 bee stings and can relieve one, there's noticeable improvement.  A better description would be ""Imagine you get stung 6 times per day and you have the option to treat one sting a week"".  The entire problem is that they're losing ground every day and any progress they make is to lose less ground per day, not actually making forward progress.",1285114019

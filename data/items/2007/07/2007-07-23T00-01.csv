35998,comment,35972,35995,0,0,vlad,,,"(Before the edit, you had asked me to say what I thought was wrong, so since I already typed this list out, here it is.)<p>Again, please don't think I'm insulting your intelligence or programming skills when I critique it..<p>1) Way too big<p>2) Created in Photoshop or GIMP, which are for photo editing<p>3) By an amateur<p>4) No kerning adjustment has been made<p>5) Saved as a JPG instead of a GIF, with artifacts<p>6) Won't resize properly even if it was the perfect logo because it's not a vector image<p>7) You took both words and made them look like what each word is.  As if 1-6 didn't make it look amateur already, this does it even more.<p>8) There is no ... what's the word I'm looking for.. cohesion between the meaning.  I guess there is no... focus.  Yes, there are lines connecting the two words but there is no cohesion between the meaning.<p>9) One color in an already amateur-looking logo signals the person is even more of an amateur.<p>10) The color was popular in 1997.<p>11) If not amateur, then it looks cheap and makes the company look cheap.<p>12) Not something you could fix.<p>13) The kerning issue, though already mentioned, keeps jumping out on me.<p>14) The bar by the S doesn't even go smoothly into the S.<p>15) The dot in the word Focus makes me feel like we're talking about contact lenses.<p>16) Why? Because you literally used no creativity and went with the gut instinct to choose a font that looks like the Focus-brand logo shown on Television (maybe subconsciously) without thinking about what it should look like in terms of a project management software.

Your goal here is not to spend $5,000 on a perfect logo... But some small amount on a logo that doesn't look CHEAP.",1185152184
35997,comment,35972,35985,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"You're the second person to make the nipple comment - you definitely have your mind in the right place :)<p>For the typeface, I'm trying to hint at the meaning of the ideas with the words - which may be a mistake.  The stream being more ""fluid"" and wider, the focus being precise.  We'll try it with the same font to see how it looks too.<p>Good point on the lead in tail - that is a problem with the font - but I will definitely fix that.",1185151577
35996,comment,35938,35956,0,0,neilc,,,"That's an interesting idea -- I would imagine that there's a lot of commonality between the legal paperwork you need for most early-stage startups, and when differences exist, they can often be parameterized reasonably well (""$a founders, $b equity pool, $c shares per founder, vesting according to schedule $d"", etc.). Putting some common templates for this kind of paperwork up on a wiki somewhere would be useful, I think.",1185151353
35995,comment,35972,35994,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"We're asking for advice from as many areas as we can, but we tend to get great feedback here as the YCers tend to pay more attention to design than others.   We probably will hire a graphic designer at some point, but its much cheaper to spend a few hours ourselves (and I am an architect with distinct ideas about design) than put our money in a graphic designer at the moment as we are bootstrappers.  I think our next major expense will be lawyers.",1185151319
35994,comment,35972,35972,0,0,vlad,,,"I was going to write that you should just hire a graphics designer so you can focus on your startup, but I think the biggest point is that you are targetting the wrong people.",1185151068
35993,comment,35972,35991,0,0,gibsonf1,,,":) - that version was definitely more fun.<p>The reason for the change was to be a little less playful and a little more serious.  The stream symbol on the old version was a meandering stream, now we have a fast stream - the idea being that our application helps you work a lot faster and smarter.",1185150985
35992,comment,35972,35972,0,0,thomasswift,,,"I think its pretty good, I like the different fonts. The lead-in tail of the 'S' looks to have one or two more pixels then the actual lower part of the 'S'.<p>The 'O' - While it does look kinda like a nipple, it also is a designy(word?) way of a target, bullseye or focus point - so I get that and I like that.",1185150968

35990,comment,35953,35983,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"Well if they can get 100,000 live listings and they can get average views up to about 1 a day per listing (seems doable at their rate with organic traffic and such) and get $10CPM off of Adsense or whatever (~ what I get across my ad-based sites), then they're talking $1000/day or $365K a year.  If it costs essentially $0 to operate and it is one or two people, that is a decent salary (especially for one).  Additionally, if it costs hardly anything to maintain (including their time), they can run this thing for cash and work on other things at the same time.<p>Also most of their target market may visit FB every day, but not all.  And some will just search the Internet for listings.  Some of course go to craigslist and other sites.  And plenty of non-college people could see the listings too through Internet searches and contact the college kids.  There are lots of opportunities here.<p>I guess what I'm saying is if they want to give up and give me their site, I'm sure I can make some money off it given their decent start without trying to hard (read using much of my time) :)",1185150881

Top down.  Assuming you have some experience, confidence, or sample code in java that you can use or understand in the problem domain.  So rather than trying to find a way to use recursive functional definition of a factorial in your code (bottom up) it Might be possible to work top down and make the &quot;main loop&quot; or whatever of your java program a functional construct of some sort.<p>I am in no way claiming this is the best way, only way, or even a good way to learn FP concepts but it is a possible way to at least get feet wet, plus or minus your personal characteristics.  It is merely an alternative to the extremely popular nearly universally pushed educational strategy of bottom up introduction of FP.",1402315014

Beware however that some clients will go badly wrong if they don&#x27;t get to send all their data.<p>What can happen is:<p>* Client starts to send HTTP request (e.g. POSTing a file). The file is large, so it will take a while to upload.<p>* Server spots that the user isn&#x27;t allowed to upload the file and immediately returns a 4xx error of some kind.<p>* Server then thinks all is finished, closes connection.<p>* Client, still sending the file, gets an error as the write() fails. Complains about the broken connection to the user but never notices the actual HTTP response.<p>Many HTTP clients are written in a simple &#x27;send my request, then (and only then) read the response&#x27;.

7867952,comment,7867370,7867370,1,0,epaladin,,,"Kei cars make perfect sense in Japan- the density in city areas, the lower speed limits (compared to the US), smaller house driveways which could probably fit two kei cars but not two &quot;regular&quot; cars. At some point I saw a house (in either Okazaki or Kanazaa, I forget) that had a Ford Excursion in the driveway, and it stuck halfway into the road- that was a very rare sighting. Most people speak pretty positively of their K-car experiences. Instead of trying to pressure people in Japan into buying larger cars, wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense to try to reduce the preconceptions about them and develop an export market? It sounds like this attempt will only result in more people ditching cars for scooters again, or dropping down to one car when they previously had two. Cars- of any kind- are already rather expensive to own there.<p>They&#x27;ve already had to replace most of their nuclear power with fossil fuel based sources. Pressuring people into buying less efficient cars seems like a giant backward step for a country that&#x27;s generally considered to be fairly eco-conscious (when you ignore the past destruction of ecosystems for building, and the effects of concreting all the riverbeds). It&#x27;s much easier to breathe in Tokyo than Beijing, it would be great if it stayed that way!<p>As an aside, I think Japan&#x27;s regulation on diesel exhaust for large hauler trucks is actually less strict than the US. I was in Okinawa last year, and there was constant traffic from large construction trucks that were always billowing black exhaust that smelled horrific- it seemed much worse than 18 wheelers here. I also noticed it when I tried backpack from Nagoya to Osaka on a rural road in 2010- the truck exhaust seemed to hang in the air longer and felt more choking than modern truck exhaust in the US (familiar with this from doing distance runs on roadsides).",1402314548

So why not assume from the outset that the client is just another part of the team and must sign-of on everything every single day.  Give the client complete access to all data about the project.

First it&#x27;s cheap solar, now it&#x27;s &quot;the roads will pay for themselves&quot; and &quot;we need rugged infrastructure&quot;.  The problems with this:<p>• Solar infrastructure which cannot pay for <i>itself</i> cannot pay for roads <i>in addition to itself.</i><p>• There&#x27;s an existing ruggedized highly-durable efficient roadbed technology for long-haul passenger and freight traffic.  It does away, incidentally, with asphalt.  It&#x27;s called <i>railroads</i>:  steel rails on wooden sleepers and gravel ballast.<p>&quot;Solar Roadways is going to cost $60 trillion&quot;<p>(NB:  &quot;dollars&quot; is redundant if you&#x27;re using the &quot;$&quot; symbol).<p>The $30-$60 trillion figure was arrived at <i>using commercially available pricing for tempered glass</i>.  If Solar Roadways believes they can beat this cost estimate, the first thing they need to show is <i>a cost of glass well below $300 per m^2 as Thunderf00t cited in his debunking video.</i>  That should be trivial.  And yet they haven&#x27;t.<p>&quot;Asphalt roads are cheap and maintainable&quot;<p>The question isn&#x27;t &quot;are present highways cheap or expensive?&quot;, but &quot;does Solar Roadway&#x27;s scam, I mean, scheme, actually beat those costs&quot;.  I can point to all sorts of troubling things in the world, <i>but unless the alternative I propose is actually BETTER then all the hurt presently felt doesn&#x27;t improve my proposal one whit</i>.<p>&quot;We can&#x27;t afford to heat roads&quot;<p>Again, Thunderf00t:  scraping snow and ice off of roads, and allowing blacktop to absorb solar radiation <i>and converting it to heat with an efficiency of 100% to melt the remaining snow and ice</i> is VASTLY less energy-intensive than applying heat of fusion to ice to convert it to water.<p>Again, SR&#x27;s scam, erm, scheme, defends its proposal based on the undesireableness of the present situation, not on any actual merits of their proposal.  For it has none.<p>On glass vs. asphalt:  the question isn&#x27;t the hardness of the materials, but on <i>the durability</i> with the added proviso that <i>the material serve all its functions</i>.<p>Asphalt has the primary requirement of remaining asphalty.<p>Glass would have to exhibit <i>both</i> the durability of asphalt <i>and</i> sufficient transparency to permit solar radiation to be absorbed and LED signals to be emitted.<p>Speaking of LEDs:  the rebuttal fails to mention the most significant of Thunderf00t&#x27;s critcisms:<p>• That much roadside signalling can occur with zero electronics or power requirements through passive reflectors.  As is done today.<p>• That static, horizontally-mounted signage is sufficient for virtually all other circumstances.  Where periodic signage changes are necessary (e.g., road closures), flippable signage can be used.<p>• If <i>dynamic</i> information is necessary, <i>that</i> can be provided with occasional electronic signboards, raised <i>above</i> the roadbed (for increased visibility) and with optimally targeted and shaded LED lighting (or variable reflective displays), which are fully legible in daylight.  And at vastly lower cost than resurfacing every last inch of roadway in the nation.<p>And the rebuttal utterly fails to address the transmission line costs:  $1 - $2 million dollars per mile, across the 23,000 miles of roadway, for another $23 - 46 <i>billion</i> dollars of cost.<p>It&#x27;s still bullshit.<p>P.S.:  As to why debunking this matters.  <i>Yes</i> we&#x27;ve <i>absolutely</i> got some hugely challenging constraints headed our way, and some of the earlier ones aren&#x27;t far off (NB:  US EIA and the IEA both predict US fracked gas and oil will peak by 2020).  Addressing energy needs is at the heart of many of these.  <i>Solar offers sufficient net total potential, the main constraints are cost and build-out.</i>  And there are other options out there I&#x27;d like to see pursued (wind, hydro, geothermal, maybe even nuclear -- I&#x27;m not a huge fan but if it provides a bridge or even permanent solution, so be it).  And more hare-brained stuff such as Seawater Fischer-Tropsch Fuel Synthesis (SFTFS), which is a longer shot but passes my initial sniff test (it&#x27;s also got the coal industry interested for some reason: <a href=""http://redd.it/25iz78"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redd.it/25iz78</a>).<p>Solar Roadways is at best a distraction, at worst a scam that will be used against stuff that actually <i>will</i> work, or is <i>actually</i> worth pursuing.<p>The problems are getting people&#x27;s hopes up over nothing, investors losing money to a scam, wasted investment, and even greater confusion and disinformation among the public.  As bad as the SR people are, I find the press who&#x27;ve been shilling this on their behalf are even worse (I plan to assemble a Hall of Shame some time Real Soon Now).  And it&#x27;s a credit to amateur debunkers who&#x27;ve run the numbers and applied actual engineering knowledge to this, on Reddit, YouTube, G+, and elsewhere, who&#x27;ve put the so-called professional press to shame.",1402313753

7867888,comment,7867634,7867634,11,0,pron,,,"I used to like functional programming. Now I think that it&#x27;s -- more often than not -- a solution in search of a problem. I can understand some of the things FP gets you (although those come at a cost, which I&#x27;ll get to later); I&#x27;m just not so sure these are the things we need, or that FP is the best solution for them.<p>One is code reuse: yes FP code is definitely more reusable. The problem is that the kind of code it enables reuse of more than OO is very small, simple loops. This is never a big issue. Writing the same 4 line method -- which could have been abstracted with a monad -- 10 times in a 50-150K LOC project is never a big problem, and these methods rarely contain bugs. On the other hand, OO code is often easier to refactor and modify. Sometimes -- in Java for example -- dynamic linking combined with OO, lets you modify/add functionality without even re-compiling existing code. Heck, it let&#x27;s you add and load new polymorphic type implementations at runtime. It is much more malleable than FP code.<p>Another is state management: yes, FP is one solution to the problem of managing state, especially in a multicore environment. But it is neither the only solution, nor is it the best. The Clojure solution of -- for lack of a better name -- &quot;transactional&quot; mutable state is simpler than the pure FP one, and just as safe. I.e. there are ways to make side-effects safe without restricting them so much that they become a nuisance (after all, all software, possibly with the exception of compilers, exists for the sake of its side effects).<p>Finally (and I&#x27;ve said this before on HN), a language like Haskell discounts the very useful choice of reasoning about your code after it runs, favoring, instead, all-upfront reasoning, often at the expense of facilitating the former. There are some domains where figuring everything up front is very important. Others, where trial and error is far more productive.<p>So pure FP increases code reuse, but of code that&#x27;s not that important to reuse. It helps deal with the hard problem of state management, but other, simpler solutions exist. Finally, it makes it hard to &quot;feel&quot; how your code runs, to debug it, to profile it, and more. I think it is based on the premise that if programming could be made more formal -- more <i>mathematical </i>, if you will -- it will become easier/&quot;better&quot;. But that premise has not been shown to be true. The lack of magically bug-free, FP OSs, drivers, control software, and large applications, shows that even the biggest supposed benefits of languages like Haskell, are yet to be demonstrated in the real world.<p>EDIT: Just to clarify: Unfortunately FP does not have a definition, so, when I was saying &quot;FP&quot;, I meant &quot;FP as the article&#x27;s author practices&quot;, which means &quot;statically typed, pure FP&quot;. FP using Java streams, FP in Clojure/Erlang, and FP in Haskell mean very different things.",1402313341

7867842,comment,7865852,7866452,1,0,ajanuary,,,"Before ARC they used manual reference counting. At runtime each object has a count of how many things have declared they have a reference to it. You can increment that count by doing [obj retain] whenever you know you&#x27;re keeping a reference to it that will outlive the stack frame. When you&#x27;re done with the object you can do [obj release] to decrement the counter. When the counter hits zero, the memory for the object can be freed (I don&#x27;t actually know if it&#x27;s done immediately or added to a list of objects to free later).<p>What the automatic part of ARC does is, at compile time, analyse the code and automatically add the retain and release messages. If it determines the reference will outlive the stack frame, it adds a retain message. if it determines the reference can no longer be dereferenced (maybe because another object reference is assigned to that variable) it adds a release message.<p>The runtime characteristics are the same as ARC, it just means the programmer no longer needs to work out where to add the retain and release messages (though they still need to think about reference cycles).",1402312114

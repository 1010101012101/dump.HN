However I think what frustrates me about the language are largely problems that have to do with tiny details in the interpreter and less the language itself. These interpreter details however are becoming part of the language and this is why they are important.&quot;<p>He is right, Python has not real standard with clearly defined semantics. Actually, the standard is CPython, but CPython is full of crap that other implementations are then forced to implement thus making that crap part of the language. You should avoid Python at any cost, into the trash it goes.",1408201193

It is always interesting to learn another platform.  \nThe beginning will probably be rough : here is a whole platform and you probably don&#x27;t know anything about it. But at the end of the day, you will find that most of the android development tools are on par with iOS ones (with a few exceptions, an emulator is very good for non regression tests, but not that much for development). \nYou should probably check what is the status of competitors on Android. It you have a complex product and somebody has already spent years on a similar niche on Android, it might be hard to compete.  \nYou should also be ready to totally rethink your UI/UX. Many iOS apps make the error of the 1:1 adaptation of their app to Android and that only lead to a ridiculous result (multiple back buttons on the screen, ignorance of the share button, alien interaction patterns, ...). It takes a lot of engineering time to do this kind of copy where you have to recreate all your widgets on another platforms, with a negative result.",1408200914

The accuracy of the pyramid&#x27;s workmanship is such that the four sides of the base have an average error of only 58 millimetres in length.[9] The base is horizontal and flat to within ±15 mm (0.6 in).[10] The sides of the square base are closely aligned to the four cardinal compass points (within four minutes of arc)[11] based on true north, not magnetic north,[12] and the finished base was squared to a mean corner error of only 12 seconds of arc.[13] The completed design dimensions, as suggested by Petrie&#x27;s survey and subsequent studies, are estimated to have originally been 280 Royal  cubits high by 440 Royal cubits long at each of the four sides of its base.

Continuing with the voltage example, for a low voltage, one that will shock but not cause lingering pain, a simple barrier would suffice to prevent careless bumping into. For higher voltage, a box with a door connected to an interlock that cuts power when the door is open is better. To receive a shock, either the interlock would need to fail, or the operator would need to deliberately defeat it. In even higher voltage situations, where the shock could cause permanent damage or death, trusting that single interlock would be insufficient, and further protections would be needed.<p>In general, assume mistakes will happen, and design so that a serious failure requires multiple mistakes and/or multiple component failures. Never trust your life to a single component not failing.<p>Whether C &quot;causes&quot; buffer overruns is irrelevant semantics. Using plain C without strong static analysis is equivalent to working directly on exposed voltage. Perfectly fine when nothing bad will happen as a result of inevitable mistakes.

That&#x27;s actually part of its lack of widespread popularity. The core developers didn&#x27;t add a ton of unique functionality (and most of the new stuff was backported to 2.7 anyway), but they fixed some annoying problems in the CPython codebase and broke some things in the name of cleanup/unification of concepts. They made Python easier to maintain and easier to build new features atop. They sharpened the axe.<p>Yes, they didn&#x27;t clean up Armin&#x27;s pet thing -- slots. And they created new problems for library developers in their bytes vs unicode changes. But they cleaned up a whole lot of other stuff.<p>I personally think with the maturity of pypy and the stability of both the 2.7 and 3.4 lines of development, the Python ecosystem has never been more exciting. The advances in pypy make Python attractive for CPU-bound work and the inclusion of asyncio in the stdlib will make it more and more attractive for I/O-bound work over time. Python has long been a winner for mixed workloads, and the ecosystem around Python, especially pydata utilities like numpy and pandas, keep getting better. Stop complaining -- let&#x27;s just build an awesome future atop this marvelous language.",1408198169

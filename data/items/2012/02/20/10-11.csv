It really doesn't cost the world and depending on where you are, you might even save a lot and they can definitely help you figure out what your options are for whatever situation you are in. Don't go cheap on those things... hardly anything is more important for a company than taxes - except maybe paying social insurance for your employees here in Europe.<p>You don't frakk around on these things; it makes you look extremely unprofessional and can have grave consequences.

3612027,comment,3609485,3609485,3,0,lizzard,,,"When I am clearly near death I would prefer pain relief and hospice-style care at home rather than extreme intervention. And yet, as a wheelchair user (on and off) for the last 20 years and a person in constant pain, I've had people tell me to my face they'd rather be dead than be ""disabled"". I would like to at least mention the importance of listening to people with disabilities on this issue.  Because of societal prejudice against people with disabilities, often people's judgement is that we would be better off dead than suffering or impaired. When a disabled person is depressed or suicidal, they are encouraged to die by fans of the likes of Peter Singer or Kevorkian, rather than treated for depression, and helped to have the medical and personal care, and societal infrastructure, that might improve their enjoyment of life.<p>So, please keep this in mind and perhaps read up on the complexity of the issues -- from the perspectives of disability rights activists as well as doctors or the caretakers of people who are extremely ill.  Our slogan is ""nothing about us without us"" and yet unfortunately, this article is only from the perspectives of caretakers.",1329735419

A physical paper binder goes missing and people notice. Someone gains a backdoor into your iPad and it might not ever be reported. Or as Anechoic describes it, they don't want information leaked before it goes on air.<p>Humans still play football. They are free to change the play during the snap (which is what audibles are for) and even invent new ones on the field.

Anyone wanting to sell music needs to negotiate deals with each of these individual copyright fiefdoms in order to be able to do business in the respective country. The legal costs are similar for each country, the expected returns vary wildly with affluence and size of the country.<p>Apple has very, very deep pockets and a track record of making money hand over fist, and they've got quite far with music, but movies and TV series are only available in a few countries near the top of the list in terms of GDP. You can infer from that how hard it must be for anyone else.<p>I assume they make it so difficult because they're terrified of upsetting their existing distribution channels.

The point you make has validity, but I simply cannot get behind it for the amount of stereotyping you are doing of the poor.<p>You are subscribing to the all-too-common ""poor people with big screens and iPhones? What's that all about?"" fallacy, except you ascribe even more universality to it than most.<p>> <i>""People prefer spending their money on vacation, video games, buying the latest smartphone and so on""</i><p>This is a stereotype, unless you have convincing data to back it up. It is also about as offensive and useful as ""black people! fried chicken! watermelons!""<p>See how far the conversation gets when this happens?<p>The ""poor people are poor because they waste their money on lavish stupid spending"" is a refrain we've heard way too many times. It's simply not true, fails to comprehend the complexity of the situation, and is frankly a complete moral cop-out.<p>I've had the fortunate/unfortunate experience of living on the wrong side of the tracks for part of my college years. I've lived with and befriended many of the people we upper-middles love to stereotype, victim-blame, and mock, and while there's always a sliver of truth to every stereotype, the characterization that the poor are poor, or that the poor are fat, because they're too stupid to act responsibly, is a pernicious and toxic lie.<p>Let's enumerate, for the record. You seem to believe that the poor:<p>- Spend their money on vacation, video games, and the latest smartphones instead of being smart about their finances.<p>- Need to watch 4 hours of ""dumb TV shows"" every night to be satisfied with their (presumably pathetic and meaningless) lives.<p>I honestly don't think we can have a discussion about the broader point of diet/obesity while you're chiseling at these points.<p>> <i>""You cannot seriously tell me that 33% of the US is composed of poor people living in crime-ridden suburbs.""</i><p>Have you been to the US lately? Despite what you might see in major cities or in the Valley, the majority of this country is <i>poor as fuck</i>. The notion that the vast majority of America enjoys a standard of living lightyears ahead of the rest of the world... is simply not true. Fully 42% of this country has an annual income of <i>under $25,000</i>.<p>The obesity epidemic in the USA <i>is</i> at its core tied to socioeconomic status.

I use a netbook at home with only 2gb of ram, and it absolutely takes forever to open up eclipse (even the most basic 'classic' eclipse install), to the point where I was dreading opening it up to start coding.<p>Another significant factor is that, when I started learning Scala and then Clojure, I noticed how dependent on the tooling I had become from using Eclipse in Java projects. For languages that do not have a mature set of tools favoring eclipse, than you're left with a really heavy and slow text editor. I noticed it was a terrible trade-off.<p>When I asked myself 'what programming environment is lightweight but goes beyong syntx highlight?', then it came down to emacs and vi, that I heard of. Since my particular interest was in lerning Clojure, emacs fit like a glove.<p>I'm still not really that productive, but in the long run I find that I'll gain a lot more from learning to hack in emacs.",1329733680

Etc. It is the people whom copyright is primarily enforced against. It is their natural right to share information with their fellow men that is restricted. _They_ should have a final say of how many artificial restrictions they are willing to bear to get more works produced. And maybe they dont care about works at all and value their freedoms most?<p>In the vast majority of copyright discussions, the biggest party is usually being completely ignored, like a flock of sheep. While it is _them_ that will be caged, that will sheared, that will be milked, that will be slaughtered by the resulting policy, they are the only ones having absolutely no baaa and meeh in how much freedom they are willing to trade for how big a benefit. We have only special interests standing around the corrals and deciding ""whats best"" for the corralled sheep, and unsurprisingly, the decision always end up as total and maximal exploitation of the ones who have no say in it.<p>How the fuck is this ""democracy""? Why is copyright constantly and permanently being excluded from ""the will of the people"" being mapped into law?

We want people performing at the max, and if that means using these medicines, then great, then we should be free to choose what we want as long as we're not harming someone.' I'm not taking that position, but we have this winner-take-all culture and that is the way it is likely to go.""<p>Huh?  ""Winner-take-all culture""?  This seems like a moral issue.<p>I suspect that a lot of human suffering -- or at least missed potential -- is due to our cognitive biases and other mental shortcomings.  I suspect there are many leaders, inventors, and researchers who would improve the human condition far more if they could think faster, remember better, and get tired less.  Fighting against a drug that could unleash this potential energy and save huge numbers of lives seems immoral.",1205089131

When a certain threshold of users agree that they're indeed duplicates, the two or more submissions could be ""glued"" together so that they always show up in a tight group on the page.<p>The different comment threads could be merged in a sensible way, possibly by reallocating threads from comment sections with few comments. Any comment sections that have no more comments or never had any would be disabled.

132614,story,,,1,0,manmanic,"Ask YC: Entrepreneurship Summer Program?",,"I'm a 31 year old Internet entrepreneur with two solid profitable successes under my belt and a couple more projects under way. So far at least, my style has been to take no investment, work with a single partner, and build lean operations that need little ongoing maintenance while banging out the cash. Recently I've also started investing in others' startups and/or advising in exchange for equity.<p>Before I get too deep into the next project I'm looking for some structured professional development. This summer would be a great time for me. I'm looking for a program that lasts a month or two and which will help me (a) strengthen my leadership skills, (b) gain exposure to the wider industry, (c) work with and learn from some great people.<p>The closest I can find is Stanford's Summer Institute for Entrepreneurship (http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sie/). But the site says you must be a current grad student whereas I finished my PhD in CS a couple of years back. Not to mention that the deadline is tomorrow and the crowd might be too 'green'. Another option is the Mastering Technology Enterprise program at IMD in Lausanne, Switzerland. But it seems less entrepreneur-focused and, at $40k for 6 weeks, doesn't seem to make sense.<p>Does anyone know of a program that might be suitable? I'm based outside the US but am more than happy to travel. I guess the Valley would be ideal but I'm open to any other biz/tech hub.<p>Any advice would be much appreciated.<p>(Another option would be to help mentor this summer's Y Combinator program, unpaid, but I don't see any openings for that...)",1205088578

It's not that kids ""look up"" to Barry Bonds. It's that they're not stupid, and they quickly realize the only way to succeed is to dope.<p>Staying up all night coding sounds awesome to me. Having 2x focus sounds awesome. When research assures me I'm not going to be clinically depressed for the remainder of my life as a result of medicating, I might even consider taking pills for work. But I'll feel guilty about the future I'm creating for my kids.",1205088004

132610,comment,132538,132538,0,0,jdavid,,,"I meet half of my current core team, buy not building a startup, but by building my local tech community.<p>I started a casual think tank, Fireseedgroup.net to help focus the community on tech related projects.  When barcamps started up, well the Fireseedgroup was there to throw one in Milwaukee. I helped get other communities going.  Now we have a lot of interesting things going on.<p>MilwaukeeDevHouse is next weekend, it starts on friday, and its a code party.  We have also thought about throwing hackerweekends, and startupweekends.  We have a great place to use, bucketworks.org for these events in exchange for helping others with their technology needs.<p>Through the Fireseedgroup name I am always trying to raise money for incubator projects like yCombinator, we would call ours (startupMilwaukee, or M7combinator); and other systems of change.  One platform i like is called prize economics.  In this system we would use prize money awarded to a themed challenge, like darpa, and the xprize foundation have done.<p>An example is when Milwaukee was trying to get muni-wifi setup, i proposed an option to award a prize for the best ubiquitous web application.  I felt that if the prize was $250k or more that hackers would flock to MKE to compete.  Have been able to talk to a number of people in MKE about my ideas and have meet with the visitors bureau, the mayor and other law makers.  In many cases they get excited but it doesn't go much further.  I however get on their call list for ideas and technology.  I puts me in an expert position, not from success, but from effort, and powerful people always need someone they can turn to, kinda, like you are looking now.  Those network connections are well worth the effort to me to support the community.<p>I have been able to build bridges to our community to companies like MS, Adobe, Google, Yahoo, and nVidia that were not there before.  That is powerful stuff.",1205087727

Founders may be entrepreneurs, hackers, painters, lawyers, etc...  But once the company has started, the idea is theirs.  Any further development on it from outsiders is only of value to them once there is a semi immediate upside.<p>No One I have meet is willing to invest in someone else's Idea, until they know the money is there.<p>I ALSO recommend that you do not pay other people full time until you are paying your own rent with the business.  Paid employees work 9-5 for a paycheck, not to save your business.  I was burned on this before.<p>AND consultants work only the hours you pay them, unless you can get them to agree to a project fee, at which point the project may never get done.",1205086925

If your business plan involves extensive sales and marketing from an early stage, non-hackers might be able to add some value (you need someone to place all those Apple II's at the computer shops).<p>Remember that an idea is worth nothing. A funded idea is worth something, but it doesn't sound like you have funding since you're asking someone to work for free.<p>Most of the non-hacker founders that I heard of were personal friends of the hackers involved. It's hard to convince a hacker to take a chance on you otherwise.<p>""Great opportunity to work for free!"" is not a good value proposition.",1205086821

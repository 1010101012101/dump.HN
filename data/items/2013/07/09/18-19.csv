How important is JS speed in mobile apps, compared to rendering for example? That&#x27;s the crucial question here, and I don&#x27;t see any numbers on it. Rendering, after all, should be the same speed as a native app.<p>2. &quot;Nothing terribly important has happened to CPU-bound JavaScript lately&quot; - picking some benchmarks where there has been little change is possible. There are also benchmarks where there have been large changes. For example, many browsers now have incremental GC and background thread JITing. In some workloads these make a huge difference - but perhaps not on the old SunSpider benchmark.<p>edit: As an example of a type of code that can run far faster today than before, see Box2D, which is a realistic codebase since many mobile games use it: <a href=""http://j15r.com/blog/2013/07/05/Box2d_Addendum"" rel=""nofollow"">http://j15r.com/blog/2013/07/05/Box2d_Addendum</a>",1373396249

If after that second nobody is <i>in</i> the crosswalk, they will continue.  This allows pedestrians to comfortably stand in the general area of intersections without feeling as though they are holding up traffic.  It also allows considerate pedestrians, like I consider myself, to allow a car to continue first (I often (try to) do this when I notice that a car has waited for several pedestrians already by the time I arrive).  It also allows cautious pedestrians (as I am) to courteously opt-out of stepping in front of a car that seems impatient but begrudgingly stopped, or cars that appear distracted.<p>It drives me <i>crazy</i>.

6014485,story,,,1,0,BjoernKW,"Easy to use eMail encryption for the masses?",,"I was just wondering about how easy to use eMail encryption for the masses can be achieved or how at least some progress towards that goal could be made.<p>I was thinking along the lines of an SMTP / encryption / key management proxy that runs locally on each PC and encrypts every eMail in the background before sending it through a usual SMTP server. Usage would roughly be as follows:<p>- software prompts user about which eMail addresses to use for encrypted messages upon first start<p>- the software then generates a corresponding public / private key pair and uploads the public key automatically to public key servers<p>- the software matches eMail addresses in the user&#x27;s address book with public keys available on public key servers<p>- the software runs as a proxy background service<p>- the user sets her eMail client to use the proxy for outgoing eMail<p>- when the user sends an eMail through her usual eMail client the proxy automatically encrypts the eMail if the message recipient has a public key (if he hasn&#x27;t, an optional message could be added to the eMail telling about why it&#x27;s important to encrypt digital communication) and subsequently sends the eMail through a range of public SMTP servers<p>- optionally, the software could also work as a proxy for incoming eMail, which would allow for blocking or auto-answering non-encrypted / non-signed eMails<p>Has something along those lines been tried before? Does such a software exist already? Would you think it&#x27;s worth the effort?",1373395964

The most important part of that clause is the use of the term &quot;substandard width lane&quot;, which although not defined in the statute, has been established via jurisprudence to be approximately 14-15 ft. Many many rightmost lanes in SF are not 14+ ft wide, meaning that on most roads in SF you can legally ride right in the middle of the rightmost lane. This is much safer than putting yourself in the doorzone and swerving to avoid a door and getting hit by a driver on your left or leaving too little room on your lefthand side that some driver will try to squeeze through.<p>Every cyclist should go out and measure a lane or two here and there to get a feeling for approximately how wide a 14 ft lane is, so you know when you can legally take up the whole lane.<p>The only other thing to keep in mind with this, is that if you do take up the whole lane, it is your responsibility to pull over to the right periodically if the number of cars backed up behind you exceeds 5 (IIRC)",1373395300

6014393,comment,6012214,6012214,33,0,rz2k,,,"Perhaps the most favorable indication of the culture of commercial air flight is that the attitude exhibited by this author has been exceedingly rare.<p>First of all I haven&#x27;t read or seen any speculation that wasn&#x27;t qualified as being mere speculation. Second, this is the first instance of reading someone minimizing the accident <i>because</i> of the excellent safety record.<p>Is it too obvious to say that the safety record comes from not minimizing accidents as flukes? The rigorous/tedious checklists, innovations like removing oxygen from near empty fuel tanks so they&#x27;re less likely to explode, and flight attendant training for quick exits come from experience and the enormous amounts of attention directed at every past failure.<p>Such advances come from a combination of the expertise of people with domain knowledge <i>and</i> people outside of the domain having high standards. In 1985, described as an example of a terrible year for air travel, one still could have put the safety record in perspective with other hazards. Surely it was far more dangerous to travel by car. It is easy to imagine pilots and engineers of 1985 wishing that outsiders who knew less than them would just shut up and let them do their jobs without unnecessary distractions. It&#x27;s even easy to imagine arguments about the meddling not only being costly, but even a dangerous distraction.<p>Some hysteria, and definitely a lot of lawsuits, aided in the prioritization of problems for people who had the expertise to come up with solutions to minimize fatalities in the future. Outside, unwelcome pressure also disrupts the status quo which, by definition, is part of every failure.<p>I imagine anyone who has domain specific expertise has at least at some time been incredibly annoyed to have to deal with and attempt to manage the reactions of nonexperts while they&#x27;re in the midst of solving a problem immediately at hand. And yet, such a reaction is cowardly, and enormously unproductive in the long term.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if I am beating a dead horse over an obvious point, or not making the point very well at all, but I think it is really important to avoid the pitfalls of only talking to experts, or peers, or people within your established hierarchy of influence when attempting to address failures. This article, made me recall students of nuclear physics on Reddit talking about Fukishima, who couldn&#x27;t decide whether it was irrelevant because it was an older reactor design, or whether it was irrelevant because it occurred after an earthquake and tsunami that were more severe than the models forecast as possible, or whether nuclear disasters in general are irrelevant because their understanding of worst case was the not-that-bad-all-things-considered case of what was only achieved through heroics of people at Chernobyl.<p>What made the point for me personally was reading about failures at NASA. I highly recommend the long &quot;Columbia&#x27;s Last Flight&quot; by William Langewiesche in <i>The Atlantic</i>[1] as it had a great influence on me when it came out in 2003, and helped me learn to value input from people without specialty knowledge. Even when special expertise defines who is most likely to develop fixes, the big picture view sometimes only afforded to outsiders is important, or sometimes just enough disruption so different voices within the system are heard.<p>In the case of NASA, things were humming along for the entire edifice because it had worked before when they squelched concerns by small groups within the enormous operation. As a result, when it failed, it was the system itself that failed, and it would have been reckless to trust that system to determine what went wrong. Perhaps even more famously, with Challenger, Richard Feynman was the gadfly in that investigation, and later had plenty to say about the ability of entire cultures to encourage mistakes specifically as a result of their desire to build in-group consensus.<p>So, I think the air travel industry deserves an enormous amount of respect for its excellent safety record, and that the shortage of voices trying minimize this failure suggests that they will accurately determine what went wrong. The value of this column is as an example to the rest of us, not in the air flight industry, of what not to do, and what attitudes stand in the way of improvement and finding solutions.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/11/columbias-last-flight/304204/?single_page=true"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/11/columbia...</a>",1373395133

Sometimes they&#x27;re very specific, sometimes they require cooperation by the kernel, and sometimes you end up writing a buggy and inefficient garbage collector just to get around implementation problems. Java&#x27;s lock-free data structures are used everywhere <i>today</i> and with great results.<p>Second, regarding real-time. There are hard real-time GCs for Java, and they work great, only they tend to cost a lot of money. But hard real time systems often sacrifice performance for the sake of worst-case guarantees -- that&#x27;s a whole other set of tradeoffs. In general, and certainly when it comes to throughput, a good GC is both the easiest and the most efficient way to manage memory.<p>Finally, because, as I&#x27;ve shown, for every Java program there exists a C++ program that performs as efficiently or better, you could, given enough effort, always surpass Java. In practice, doing that is <i>extremely</i> hard (unless it&#x27;s a very specific, well understood problem), and the returns are hardly worth the effort. What you gain in integer compression you lose in method invocation. What you gain with SIMD you lose on malloc. What you gain in cache-friendliness you lose in multi-threading. And the gap is only narrowing in Java&#x27;s favor so that there are fewer and fewer things you gain when using C++.<p>This is not to say that C++ doesn&#x27;t have it&#x27;s place. First, you need it to write the JVM :) You need it in a resource constrained environment where memory is limited, and you may not want to spare a thread for concurrent GC. You need it when startup time is crucial. You need it (or Fortran) for some well-understood numeric computing problems. But for general, large, long-running server side applications - Java is king.<p>And BTW, games are years, if not a decade or more, behind advances in software engineering (I&#x27;ve had some experience in that). In the past decade they&#x27;ve literally progressed on one front only (though, an important one): graphics and GPGPU (for physics and AI). I know that some AAA studios literally forbid any multithreaded code on the CPU (beyond a simple and predefined division of labor among a few threads). MMO game engines, for examples, are practically primitive compared to advanced server-side systems in other markets.",1373394299

6014244,comment,6013989,6014187,2,0,_delirium,,,"> Without living in the US it is hard for you to come up with a valid argument against prioritizing automobile infrastructure.<p>I&#x27;m American, and have lived in the U.S. for about 90% of my life, so I&#x27;m pretty familiar with the issues. Even leaving aside major change, and just taking cities as they exist today, pedestrian/bicyclist access and safety is just not prioritized even within cities. I lived in midtown Atlanta for three years, and <i>two</i> people I know were hit by automobiles while crossing in a crosswalk (fortunately neither killed, but one injured seriously). Bicycling safely was pretty much impossible, because the roads were designed exclusively for cars. And god help you if you were anywhere worse for pedestrians than midtown, which was relatively good.<p>It&#x27;s partly infrastructure and partly culture imo. If you compare how drivers and pedestrians interact in, say, a German city center, with how they interact in Atlanta, the German intersections give much more formal protection: more crosswalks have lights, whereas many Atlanta crosswalks are not signalized, and the lights will typically give at least a short fully protected period to cross, while the Atlanta ones leave you dodging left/right turning cars even on a &#x27;walk&#x27; signal. And culturally, the German drivers are just much more conscientious about yielding right of way when the law says they should. Pedestrians in a crosswalk are supposed to have right of way in the U.S., too, but at least in Atlanta you can&#x27;t rely on it.",1373393902

If not, appointment without Senate consent likely passes muster with SCOTUS.<p>* Are FISC judges in any way supervised in a manner similar to the way that Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals judges are supervised by the Judge Advocate General of the Coast Guard? If so, they&#x27;d qualify as &quot;inferior officers&quot; regardless of the distinction between Federal circuit courts and the FISC.<p>I don&#x27;t know the answer to either question, but my guess is that regarding the former the answer is &quot;yes, the duties of a FISC judge are substantially similar to (in fact a small subset of) the duties of a general Article III judge&quot;, and my guess to the latter is &quot;no, the supervisory role Roberts has over the FISC judges isn&#x27;t meaningful enough to qualify them as inferior officers under Article II&quot;.<p>My guess is that a yes on <i>either</i> question makes it more likely than not that the USG would prevail in arguing that the FISC is an Article III court, though I still think the issue is murky.<p>The last couple of days have been quite an education on this.

Take for example GM or any other major car manufacturer in the U.S. 50 years ago the main reason Toyota was able to gobble up so much of the market was because the U.S. automakers HAD to give the unions what they wanted because the government stepped in when they would strike. Leading to outrageous pensions, 6 hour work days, etc.<p>Organizing to improve working conditions makes sense, but the U.S. government stepping in to FORCE employers to meet standards that the union sets is a bit out outrageous to me. If you&#x27;re doing manual labor and replaceable it&#x27;s mighty hard to unionize without the government support, I understand that. Unfortunately, because you are replaceable you don&#x27;t have pull and SHOULD NOT have pull. If a companies working conditions are really that dangerous you can work in another factory or educate yourself and become skilled enough to be worth while to please. Not to mention, if it is that dangerous most people probably wont work in that line of work unless they have no choice, in which case they should be HAPPY to have that dangerous job because they can eat.<p>Call me calloused, but I would personally rather work a dangerous job and get food, as opposed to robbing my employer.

The disadvantage is that you have stop-the-world GC and potential for data races, so you must rely on the race detector. Erlang&#x27;s advantage is that you have no data races and no stop-the-world GC (and Erlang&#x27;s GC is easier to implement). The disadvantage is that all messages must be copied and parallel algorithms that require data sharing are more difficult to write.<p>There are hybrid approaches like Singularity, JS with transferable data structures, and Rust (disclaimer: I work on Rust). These systems use some form of static or dynamic access control scheme (for example, uniqueness or immutability) to control data races and perform memory management for shared data structures, while retaining Erlang&#x27;s thread-local GC.<p>[1] With one exception, the memory unsafe data race in maps and slices.

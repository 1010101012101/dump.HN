This is not currently possible in Chrome. To get the screenshot, you need to allow access to Amazon.com in the permissions list of the extension config, i.e. manifest.json. This, however, gives you permission to request resources from Amazon that the user did not load into the browser, like all their previous purchases. And if there's another URL in the permissions list that the extension developer hosts, they can set up an API for the extension to phone home the users private data on Amazon.<p>Here's a sample that demonstrates this: <a href=""http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/common/extensions/docs/examples/api/tabs/screenshot/manifest.json?revision=88353&view=markup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/commo...</a><p>Note that ""tabs"" and ""code.google.com"" must both be listed in the permissions.",1313876869

2907797,comment,2905686,2907351,2,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"Nice points.  Okay, I revise my argument!  What will be left are genes, in the society, in both men and women as required, that make the people, men and women as required, really WANT to have babies!  Then back to my argument:  The population will shrink on the way there and then will grow again.<p>There is another point on my side:  It is commonly accepted that what children do is a mixture of both 'nature' (genes) and 'nurture' (that is, what they learned from their parents).  There are common, strong suggestions that a daughter of a women who is really happy being a mommy is more likely to want to be a mommy.  So, net, for a woman to WANT to have children can have come down from nature or nurture.<p>In my experience, some women REALLY want to have children, and some women REALLY do NOT want to have children.  When I was in the ninth grade, I met and dated a girl in the seventh grade, natural blond, great figure, very sweet, who REALLY wanted to have children, knew it, admitted it.  E.g., each time she saw the face of a baby with its common characteristics, she wanted to have a baby.  Now, I'm not saying that she wanted to have a baby there in the seventh grade, but she wanted to be a MOMMY eventually.  And she was, eventually.<p>And I've known women who had children or not and, in both cases, looked at motherhood as ""giving up the best years of their lives and their careers doing low grade, menial scut work to take care of some MAN'S [bitter resentment and anger about the man] children"".  Sure, the position was partly just negotiations as ""don't throw me into that briar patch"" but also was meaningfully genuine.<p>Net, now, some women WANT to be mommies, and some don't.  Does this situation inherit, via nature and/or nurture?  My observations say that it does.  My observations are not very good data, but if the observations are roughly correct then we conclude that the effect, even if weak, could be how Mother Nature will ""find a way"".<p>More generally I have confidence that Mother Nature will 'win' this one, will meet the challenge, will ""find a way""!<p>While I believe that the 'way' I mentioned, that women WANT to have children, and that this will get passed from mother to daughter, is the one Mother Nature will select, there can be other ways.  E.g., a society can get rid of anything like US Social Security and, thus, tell people in stark terms that they need to have children as a source of support in old age.  A society can tell girls that it does not support single women or single mothers and, net, girls should look for good husbands or hope that they have good brothers or have good inheritance from their fathers..  There can be a role for some traditional religions that strongly emphasize 'traditional family values' and having children, whether the women want to or not.  Some people might say that the result will not be a change in the gene pool but in the popularity of some religious, social, and/or political values.<p>Or one might just say that the 'Darwinian' effect will apply to whole societies, e.g., Finland:  Finland beat Sweden, Russia, and Germany in wars but is losing out to the 'feminists'!  Whatever the politics, at 1.5 children per woman, Finland is on the way out of it as surely as some genocide.  So, maybe it's countries that will die off instead of people with the wrong genes.  Still, I trust the influence of genes more than that of politics.<p>Your issue of ""N generations on"" is interesting:  In part my analysis is saying that the women were much the same 40,000 years ago, which would be about N = 2000 generations!  So, it would seem that we could extrapolate a few generations from the N = 2000 generations!  But, in part my analysis is saying that, if you will, the current, big 'environmenal' changes, i.e., from women having jobs, will bring the biggest changes in the gene pool in 40,000 years and bring the changes very quickly, in, say, just a few generations, say, just 100 years.  My reading of evolution is that, when the 'enviroment' changes, then genes can change very quickly.  E.g., the genes in some of those weak, sick, or dead limbs on the tree are already gone forever.",1313876404

You're not :).<p>Joke aside - I don't want to write essays here, so I'm gonna try to make a hopefully brief point.<p>I -know- your essay was well-intentioned, and believe me, so is my reaction, after having written software for a living for nearly 15 years...<p>Rather than to expound - let me ask you - do you know of Martin Fowler? I can get Graham and his cult-like persona has ensnared you/others somewhat in his FP-Kool-Aid cult :D... but read Fowler for a bit of balance too.<p>Your intention was actually awesome - you want to illustrate a general principle, e.g. an abstraction, that thinking via and writing through a functional paradigm/language makes you a better programmer. Is that ""true"" to the extent you and a bunch of other FP-evangelists claim? Why, yes it is! So is learning assembly language, or Brainf*ck for that matter....<p>Why I mentioned and really enjoy reading Fowler's non-imposing, well-argumented style of writing is because he effectively does, what you bravely attempt to do here, convey a general principle about _programming languages_, except he does it expertly, whereas you do it naively, despite the good intention. To get what I'm saying, surf over to www.amzn.com, and get yourself a copy of Fowler's Domain Specific Languages.<p>Upon reading that book, heck, even half way, you soon come to the same realization that what one of the other repliers to my original rant has come into some time ago - we are ultimately discussing various paradigms/philosophies of thinking.  Not ONE single or multiple paradigms that are tailored to your particular way of thinking or that you are ""hard wired"" for (which I find hard to believe, but I'll grant some 'nature vs nurture' arguments here too), makes you or anyone else, me included, necessarily a 'better' programmer... I'd go as far as saying that it's probably your personality, mental/emotional states you experience on a daily basis while glued to your PC, that have you be more or less effective at programming, e.g. you're a 'perfectionist/procrastinator', most common among programmers, or you're extreme and reckless and use inadequate tools to just conjure something up, looking to get 'promoted' and it blows up a few months later or BSOD's in a demo to the board of directors....<p>This has been said over and over, and for some reason, it doesn't sink in - there is no silver bullet, there is no 'better/worse' programmer - unless you count lines of code produced per day as a 'productivity measure', hardly a clever measure of anything...<p>Back to your essay - I'd much rater you embark on the topic of DSLs, rather than using CL as a platform to write a DSL in - which is -fine- except maybe people who are unfamiliar with Lisp's syntax, e.g. domain experts, can relate to a specific, external DSL better than they can relate to a LISP based DSL...<p>Think of teaching a DSL to a ... I dunno, a postal worker who examines mail rejects that didn't pass the OCR phase. You could construct a DSL specific to that purpose. It would be relevant and useful and increase the worker's productivity.<p>On the flipside, teaching him Lisp, such that he can learn a DSL designed inside of Lisp, would be a pain in the ass...<p>DSLs, e.g. macros, are one of the highly touted benefits of Common Lisp, which I actually like, because of its multiparadigm ('dirty') nature...<p>Anyway, I don't really want to indulge here - I think if you are serious about writing something, which I believe you are - be as balances as you can be, and never throw ANYONE under the bridge - including people who have only coded VB in their life.... You are either on board w/all people, or you're alone.<p>Smugness about a particular paradigm is something I'd stay away from, as well as people who hypnotize you with their eloquence and ""successes"" (financial or otherwise) into thinking that they've discovered the next best thing since sliced bread.....<p>This is why, as much as I like my Macbook, I still think Apple's a cult, and that Linux will eventually prevail, even on mobile platforms, tablets, etc.<p>Peace.",1313876218

They just took their only viable product and said ""Whatever"". They act like they have an interest in licensing webOS. Ha! How long have they been shopping licensing?

A Touchpad with Android installed is a pretty poor prospect, frankly there are better Android tablets out there.<p>I'm buying a Touchpad because I love webOS, otherwise I would just go out and buy a Samsung or whatever with Honeycomb and much better hardware than the Touchpad.",1313874047

I admit that I use cursor and mouse interchangeably, when they're actually not the exact same thing, however.",1313874018

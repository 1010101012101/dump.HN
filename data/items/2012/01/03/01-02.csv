3418295,comment,3416911,3417766,0,0,gfodor,,,"The devil is in the details. There is no way to know for sure what level of features or polish is truly going to yield unbiased results. It could be that if you were to add that 11th feature, you'd have hit the sweet spot where the product clicks for the consumer. The catch is that there's really no good way to know if it was the 11th or 12th feature that was necessary for you to get there. If your initial MVP with only 10 features fails, how do you know to plug in the 11th or just throw in the towel on that idea altogether?<p>My biggest beef with the lean startup philosophy is it seems to encourage engineers away from working on deep, hard problems for a long time. It's all too easy to release something basic <i>too early</i>, see it inevitably ""fail"", and decide to ""pivot"" based upon this. I feel this is often a symptom of a deeper disease: either not having courage in your convictions or not building something that you could see yourself (or someone you know) using regularly. In short: in creative endeavors it is sometimes <i>healthy</i> to have bias in your views based upon intuition and not direct evidence (""I don't care what the A/B test said, we're going with this idea anyway"") because sometimes this intuition can lead you down corners that break you out of local minima up to another plateau.",1325555990

3418268,comment,3416777,3418029,0,0,wnewman,,,"You write, in comparing ""our"" (presumably US) system to the Finns that our system is not only ineffective and inefficient, it is <i>immoral</i>.<p>Are you saying that non-internationalist socialism is inherently moral while individual property rights and exchange are not? That morally speaking someone's education should not be determined by who their parents are, but should be determined by the nation to which their parents are subject? Would you like to give a hint why?<p>The notion that individual economic rights are void while national economic rights are valid is delicious for people whose most valuable asset is their inherited citizenship or their power in nationalist institutions, so over the last century or so enormous effort has been expended in trying to justify this notion. However, the state of the art in such moral justifications does not impress me. Is there a particular justification that you are not embarrassed to be associated with?<p>The old internationalist socialism was screwed up in various vital ways, but at least I can understand how an idealist could be attracted to it. In this particular policy question, I can see how an idealist would attracted to the idea of opening an educational program to everyone in the world. But you seem to see clear moral superiority in a system which is open only to those who inherited Finnish citizenship.<p>As socialist ideas spread in practical politics, internationalist ideas were almost completely abandoned. (See e.g. how large transfer payments within nations are compared to how large foreign aid is, or how interested people are in Gini coefficients within nations compared to globally.) This doesn't stop modern noninternationalist socialists from regularly appealing to the old internationalist rhetoric for justification, but that's dishonest. (It's also circumstantial evidence for how weak the moral arguments for noninternalist socialism are, or more precisely, how the ones which aren't hopelessly weak tend to be strong enough to ""justify"" various of the horrors of the twentieth century, or various older nastiness like heriditary aristocracy or slavery. Classical liberalism and universalist socialism differ in whether ""positive rights"" and equality of outcome are better than ordinary negative rights and equality under the law, but justifications for both tend to appeal to a general idea of equal rights of all humans. To justify noninternationalist socialism of the usual heritable citizenship sort, you have to break that and find a way to justify hereditary privilege.)<p>Note also that essentially all those moral arguments for national economic rights are subject to various classic moral questions against how to get individual economic rights quite right. E.g., it is a classic difficult question how to assign individual property rights initially in a morally satisfying way. This question doesn't get any easier when it comes to assigning property rights to individual noninternalist socialist nations in a morally satisfying way. (And to it is added the new question of how individual people are to be assigned to such nations in a morally satisfying way.)<p>There are defensible <i>practical</i> justifications for the conclusion that individual people shouldn't have individual economic rights but that individual nations should, in particular the observation that strongly collectivist nations punched above their weight in some of the wars of the 20th century. (There are also arguments based on the supposed inefficiency of a free market, but those have fared so poorly in reality that most people no longer advance them, at least without couching them in calculated vagueness or doublespeak.) But you seem to be appealing not to some empirical practical justification, but to some abstract moral justification, and I am unable to guess which you might have in mind.",1325555277

3418245,comment,3416777,3418140,0,0,CPlatypus,,,"Your ""authority"" is crap.  The original article explicitly compared Finland not only with Norway but with individual US states that had similar population and percentage of immigrants.  That's about as apples to apples as you can get, considering that US schools are primarily subject to state rather than federal guidelines, and Finland still came out ahead.<p>By way of supposed refutation, you present a source that is full of strong claims substantiated by little more than the most blatant cherry-picking.  The author's ""correcting for demography"" is no more than throwing out the data he doesn't like.  Ignoring the fact that the immigrant factor has already been examined, he pulls tricks like comparing second- and third-generation immigrants in Finland to native Swedes.  Notice how the obvious comparison between native Finns and native Swedes isn't made, because it wouldn't support his conclusions.  Then he goes on to say ""In the case of America, 99% of the population originates from other countries"" and suggests that we compare such loosely-defined American immigrants to people in their home countries - without regard for such things as economic differences between the countries.  After arbitrarily excluding Asians because they pull the results up, Hispanics because they pull the results down, and undeclareds for no methodologically sound (or even fully explained) reason, he comes up with a highly suspect graph purportedly showing how the US ""beats"" most of Europe.<p>Here's the kicker: even after cooking the data that much, Finland <i>still</i> comes out well ahead of the US.  No matter how hard he tries, he still can't manage to reverse the original conclusion.  In the end, citing that does more to discredit your position than to support it.",1325554815

This is easily fixed by guarding that section of code to make sure that it always returns a string and never returns undefined.",1325552947

The semantics of the language seem to imply that the pixel kernel can pass information on to the next pixel via the stack. To be able to split up the rendering work that dependency needs to be eliminated such that each pixel depends only on x,y,t- and values pushed by the last run are implicitly cleared in single thread implementations. What sort of impact will that have on existing demo programs?",1325552787

Sure, it's better to use a language that lets you have less complexity even as your codebase grows quite large. You mentioned Haskell.

974501,comment,974256,974434,0,0,dmfdmf,,,"Its a good rule but not always true.  It depends on what price is being negotiated, e.g. salary, car price, etc.  If someone throws out a number that is clearly too high (seller) or obviously too low (buyer) just to get the ball rolling there is no loss in negotiating strength from that, both parties know they are still far apart so nothing has changed.  Also, vague numbers like ""around $60K"" are less committal, express common ground and more likely to be attempts to get the ball rolling. Another important rule is do not negotiate with your self. In other words, if you made an offer don't raise it until the other guy makes a counter offer.  This is negotiation 101 but its very easy to get pressured to raise your offer without a counter offer. As for salary negotiations, I read an article once that a company's first solid offer (which is their low starting point) is somewhere around %20 below what the company is actually willing to pay you.  So add 25% to the company's first offer and if that number is not near what you think you are worth you need to find someone else to work for or reevaluate the market value of your skills.",1259855251

I have a stable job as a business systems analyst/developer for a large financial institution.<p>Lately, I have been thinking about the Next Step for my career path and feel compelled to further my education. I've narrowed my options down to two paths:<p>[1] MBA (for IT Professionals) or<p>[2] Oracle Certification Program.<p>I really enjoy database work (programming, tuning, security, etc.) and think Oracle is the strongest RDBMS so the Oracle Certification Program seems an obvious choice, but I'm curious if anyone has had any experience with this or had to make a similar choice.<p>My goal is to obtain the most desirable/employable skill set and to plan for the future. I'm specifically looking for people working in large corporations (500+ employees), since that's what I am most familiar with but any helpful advice would be greatly appreciated.<p>Thanks HN!!<p>[1] http://www.bryant.edu/wps/wcm/connect/Bryant/Divisions/Academic%20Affairs/Graduate%20School/ITMBA/<p>[2] http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=50&p_org_id=1001&lang=US#1",1259853747

The areas that fetishize the new (for being new) have a tendency to dislike experienced/older people. Particularly noticeable amongst web frontend people I've worked with.  In places with deep domain voodoo or that fetishize the better (systems, networking, and so on) old is not a barrier, and experience is valued.<p>As for ridiculous questions about apis... I have done well for myself by answering those types of questions with things like: ""my ide does that, so I don't know"" and ""who cares?"" -- sure I've ""lost out"" on a few code monkey jobs, but instead I've had some pretty cool stuff to work on.",1259853627

The reason: As Rupert Murdoch has pointed out in the past, there is a nearly infinite supply of advertising inventory thanks to the explosion of online outlets and social networks. How many billions or trillions of page views are served every day by media sites, YouTube, Facebook, etc? Even if ads were perfectly matched to the people who were reading them in terms of demographics and relevance to their buying interests, the problem would not go away -- there are still billions or trillions of pages being served, albeit with fewer wasted impressions. In this kind of environment, prices have to stay low.",1259853543

A similar thing happened to the music industry, who relied for so long on the ability to shift a lacklustre album on the back of a popular single. There were loud complaints from up high when consumers got the power to cherry-pick the good tracks and leave the dross on the shelf. I'll spend £2 on a Sunday paper and read less than 5% of it.

Minimal wheelspin, minimal downtime.<p>Those who use this new feature to take a, for lack of a better term, ""server-hugger"" approach to cloud computing will miss out on this.

And the developer #1 position is critical enough no-one is going to want to screw them over lightly.<p>If he's a new employee he should give his company the benefit of the doubt for a short time. And use the time to demonstrate his value. The thing to avoid is a drawn out process where it isn't clear what constitutes a reasonable timeframe for getting this problem solved and so it always gets pushed back.<p>So get the milestones figured out. If now is not a convenient time, when is a convenient time? When you've been employed for three or six months? When the company hits major development or business milestones?

Some have good reasons for this, some bad.<p>Also, you'll find that a bunch of programmers these days basically consider Java to be the entire programming universe.  Many of them have gone through university and several jobs without being exposed to anything else.  They don't really consider the fact that could be experienced programmers who have no Java knowledge, and they don't consider it a fad or a passing thing.  I suggest seeking out companies that are working with Python, Ruby, Perl, Scala, etc. - not because of the tools themselves, but because they tend to expect that candidates will be learning new tools and languages all the time.<p>Yes, you will probably be discriminated against by some companies.  Fortunately, there are companies out there that don't.  I expect the latter category will grow as the overall developer population ages.

Transpose the profession to fishing and see what proverb comes to mind.<p>But you know what, life is not about fairy-tale contests and it's not about perfect products.  Here's my story for you, the woodsman's nephew came into town and Abe, George, Ben and their buddy Thomas Jefferson all had to go home with their hands in their pockets.  But the sun still rose the next day.  The end.<p>To those about to hack, to experiment, to try and fail, I salute you.  Get out there.

I expect some fairly pretty apps to be on the device.<p>They get new ideas they bounce around too.

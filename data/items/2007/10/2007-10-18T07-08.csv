69587,comment,69066,69191,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"It remains to be seen on exactly how ""open"" the iPhone will be with the official SDK, however. I will give Apple the benefit of the doubt and expect that they will be hands-off and let developers distribute and monetize their iPhone applications as they choose. <p>But as several reports have indicated, Apple may use iTunes to maintain control over app approval, distribution, and purchases. I really hope this doesn't end up being the case.",1192692530
69586,comment,69402,69443,0,0,waleedka,,,"> I've been accused of posting this as a shameless attempt to get attention from YC.<p>Weather it's to get attention or not, it's a good post and I enjoyed reading it. Plus, there is nothing wrong in marketing oneself. In fact, it's an important skill every entrepreneur needs to have. If I were evaluating I would give you an extra point for trying. It beats doing nothing at all.",1192692098
69585,comment,69542,69542,0,0,DaniFong,,,"It's too bad that venture capitalists haven't really changed. This behavior of perennially asking if it's a bubble or it's a real growth, if the market is bullish or bearish, is exactly what causes these market bubbles in the first place. <p>If they actually concentrated on funding companies that created value, and could turn that into profit, they'd have nothing to worry about.<p>But alas, for them a market is a market, and since it's their job they trade often, and faster, and catch more of the upswing and less of the downswing. They're completely oblivious to how many people these shenanigans put out of work, or how many would be inventions are stalled or will never see the light of day because of their schoolyard bully-pack behavior.

69584,story,,,2,0,v3rg3,"Why does Software Spoil?",http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000973.html,"In the software industry, the release of newer, better versions is part of the natural order. It's a relentless march towards perfection that started with the first personal computers, and continues today. We expect software to get larger and more sophisticated over time, to track with the hardware improvements that Moore's law has provided us for so many years. Rapid evolution is a good thing, and it's one reason the computer industry is so exciting to work in. If you don't like the way things are today, just wait five years; everything will be different.",1192691881

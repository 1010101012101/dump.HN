However in most cases it is a deeply frustrating experience, mainly due to communication.<p>Any software application (unless you wake up one morning and you can write a perfect spec for it), is a deeply iterative process. As you develop you tweak and tweak and refactor and refactor. Actually any Development goes through such a process.<p>You will be better off by :<p>(01) Building up your skills so you can manage the process better<p>(02) Finding a developer in your own area, where you can communicate on a one to one basis.<p>Personally I always try to outsource the design.

813770,comment,813142,813142,0,0,sweetdreams,,,"I don't think online education will have a significant impact on major universities. However, there are a lot of colleges and universities that probably shouldn't exist. I can think of two types:<p>1. State schools that became 'universities' in the past 30 years but were previously 'teachers colleges' 'nursing colleges' and other specialized tertiary educational institutions for specific careers.<p>Seriously, does a big state like Illinois need 12 different business colleges, 12 different English departments, 12 different chemistry departments? Or how about Idaho, population 1.5 million with its 3 state universities and 5 state colleges. Really?<p>No - a lot of 'universities' only got that appellation because administrators lobbied state legislatures really hard for more money if they created the appearance that they'd be a 'world class' institution. They're not. The quality of education at many of these schools, excepting a handful of departments or colleges where they've really invested heavily, just isn't that different from what you could get in an online program. It'd be different if the University of Northern Iowa went back to being the Iowa State Teachers College - Iowa needs teachers! It probably doesn't need three different universities graduating International Studies majors.<p>2. Small standalone private colleges founded in earlier periods that don't really have a particular rationale for existing anymore.<p>Back in the 1800s, the Baltimore Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church needed to have a college that would be attended primarily by Methodist Episcopalians who wanted to be taught by other Methodist Episcopalians. Now, what is it exactly that distinguishes Goucher as an institution from any of the dozens of other tiny private colleges dotting our nation's landscape? Do their degrees carry much weight?<p>They're expensive, and up in the northeast it seems like most of them are for well-to-do suburban kids who couldn't get into the Ivy League and don't want to study with the state school rabble they've been looking down on most of their lives. What's more, it seems like a lot of them spend more time focusing on holding onto real estate than they do investing in research and academia that makes our nation better.<p>So I think major state research universities, commuter colleges in big cities, and the private university giants will do fine, and probably make even more money from whatever happens online. But if you're giving Swarthmore $50k a year, or Western Michigan $20k, you literally get what you pay for.",1252522648

813757,comment,813620,813620,0,0,floozyspeak,,,"The problem with outsourcing is all the unknowns, language barriers, weird stuff, and the fact it can be awkward and uncomfortable and its harder to tell if anyone is gonna take advantage of you or not.  Having said that, if you've done it, and earned your chops its a kick ass way to make stuff.  BUT if you're starting out i'd do 2 things, one go local, go intern, and figure out that cost.  Two look for a person who's done outsorucing to help you manage the project, you almost need them and their expertise more than just the coder on the outsourcing end.  That guy/gal with lots of experiencing outsourcing is more valuable then anything- they know to get stuff done and under budget.<p>In the past 8 months I've made 11 things i would of never even begin to know how to make and would of cost me 10-20k if i did them with local/national talent.  Theres just no way i could afford that.<p>My learnings from outsourcing.<p>An outsourcing manager is critical.  This frees you up to focus on what you should be doing, using that time/money wisely into making something, hopefully profitable.  Set expectations accordingly.  Do not expect it to be perfect.  Iterate often.  Be explicit on what you want the experience to be of whatever you are making.  Mockup everything, story board the experience of it, give them as many visuals as possible, point them to sites and say like that, never ever just give them specs in a text file, otherwise you are set for an adventure in waste.<p>Challenge yourself, your manager and whoever you hire to do it less.

They handle web design, programming, data entry, etc., for small businesses, including my own projects.<p>I would say that depending on what your project is, you'll find that there are some things that work well with outsourcing/offshoring, and others that don't.  I doubt you could suddenly learn how to program well in a short time, but you would probably have as difficult a time instructing a team of programmers if you don't know it yourself.<p>You can learn enough to build a rough prototype, and hire programmers to fill in the gaps, because you'll have the most success the simpler the outsourced tasks are.  Here is how completely outsourcing a simple project might work (to keep costs low when hiring programmers, stick with LAMP):<p>Let's say you have an idea for a cool web app that lets people looking to lose weight input foods that they usually eat, and the system will suggest lower-calorie alternatives.<p>Since you know basic design you create a rough design and a list of specs for the different pages and post it on www.designbay.com to get a design. (~$200)<p>You find a design that you like and you send it to www.psd2html.com for coding into html/css. (~$300)<p>You know enough about PHP to start writing some code to make it interactive, so now people can fill in a form and submit it, but you need help with the back end.  This task is much easier if you take the time to learn object-oriented PHP, so that changes just have to be made to the classes. (~$0)<p>Here's where you turn to www.elance.com to find a PHP/MySQL expert who can take the USDA calorie database (a list of every food and the nutritional content from the label) and put it in MySQL.  He also writes some code that takes the user's food list and finds lower calorie foods to swap (very easy to do with a few SQL statements). (~$450)<p>Obviously this is a very simple example, and I left out much of the detail, but you get the point.  Of course, depending on how hands on you want to be, you can get this done much cheaper.  Just don't expect to be able to describe the project and have someone build it from scratch for anything less than a small fortune.",1252520356

The article mentioned Hurd donating to <i>one</i> college club but if either of them want to save tennis they need to be buying or starting smaller regional tournaments with enough money to keep food on the table for the lower rungs. Or donating to dozens of colleges. Something that gets more players in the bottom. Increasing the payout for one tournament and turning one complex into tennis heaven is useless.",1433458700

9662738,comment,9661221,9662174,0,0,vanzard,,,"> For starters that address is empty. The coins from it are on the list at ~174,000 now.<p>Doesn&#x27;t matter. This one addresses alone represents hundreds of thousands of customers of Bitstamp that you are completely ignoring in your math in your previous posts. I am just pointing out to you that AT LEAST some of these big addresses are bound to represent other exchanges/online wallets.<p>> So while large wallets exist to see a number like 2.8m coins and assume it means there are at least 2m users is simplistic at best.<p>It is simplistic for you too to assume that these 2.8 million BTC are all owned by a few individuals.<p>If you want my estimate, since we don&#x27;t have much data to rely on, I think that roughly 30-70% of this 2.8 million BTC is owned by individuals and the other 70-30% represents exchange/online wallet customer funds. It&#x27;s realistic to think that even the smaller portion (30%) of 2.8 million BTC could still represent at least 1 million users. And the ~2 million addresses with smaller funds could represent another ~1 million users (as you yourself estimated, well you said 0.75 million which is close enough). So that&#x27;s ~2 million users total.",1433458491
9662737,comment,9659895,9659895,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"The article is a horrendous failure by The Intercept, which I usually love to read. The most important part of evaluating trust is character. Microsoft&#x27;s character on the topic is to use low-quality software processes until forced otherwise, notify NSA etc about bugs so they can hit them, help them do the same with third party software (eg Skype), backdoor their own stuff (eg NSAKEY), and so on. This is one of the least trustworthy companies in existence with a known track record in subverting security and crypto of their customers.<p>So, his research comes down to two major options: the above company&#x27;s crypto product with assurances of their PR team; a proprietary product with no troubling history & endorsed by a well-known cryptographer. If Win8 and above, he should start talking about BestCrypt rather than dropping a whole extra paragraph on Bitlocker&#x27;s advantages and how its fine for the average user. It&#x27;s not fine because (a) the source screws <i>all</i> of its users, (b) alternatives only flourish if you support them (vote with wallet), and (c) a site accepting submissions on corrupt organizations by leakers should never recommend trusting security tech of a corrupt organization whose contributes to the evils they report on.<p>So, this post is just stupid except for the tiny parts where it mentions alternatives. Matter of fact, it reads like an advertisement written with the assistance of Microsoft&#x27;s lawyers and publicists. I&#x27;m not saying it was but any objective investigation should never look like that.<p>Conclusion: Don&#x27;t trust The Intercept for INFOSEC advice, don&#x27;t trust Microsoft for security/crypto, use BestCrypt if on modern Windows, use VeraCrypt for Win7 or earlier, and switch to Linux if possible for extra transparency/options.",1433458462

Having paid supporters really helps there, because it feels less like a chore and more like a service.<p>As for perishable / time sensitive content... I don&#x27;t really know. I guess in that case you&#x27;re funding people for their time and expertise rather than the lasting value of the work they do. I think this would come with a very different set of challenges, but I&#x27;m not seeing where the economic problem would be.<p>In the first couple years of Practicing Ruby&#x27;s development, we did release the content only after it had been available to paying subscribers for a while. (There would be 10-20 articles available to subscribers only at any point, with a sharing mechanism that allowed folks to post links for others to jump the paywall)<p>When we stopped that and moved to directly releasing content when it was ready to be published, there was no major change in subscribers immediately, or even within a six month window after that decision was made. Actually, the cancellation rate went <i>way</i> down, so that might be a sign that the supporters were supportive of the idea.<p>The problem (and I&#x27;m sure some folks here may have guessed it), is that once everything was made available for free right away, the number of new subscriptions went way down. Whereas before we might see 30 new subscriptions a month and lose 20 people, we started seeing 1 new subscription a month and lose 2 people.<p>A sequence of events that happened since then has slowly bled the business of its revenue, although our traffic improves every week, even without new content being published for several months at a time. The most notable one is that I decided that the business ought to run on its own revenue, something that is ultimately a good thing but was a harsh change because previously I&#x27;d work 120+ hours a month on the project and only just barely squeak by on a subsistence level.<p>So basically, the project went dormant for the better part of a year, and although I did some small things from time to time, I mostly saved up the revenue so that I could pour more dedicated time into things down the line. In that process, we understandably lost supporters over time, but the main issue was bringing in new subscribers.<p>At this point, I&#x27;m burning the modest reserves I stored up, and that&#x27;s given me a few months of runway before the project needs to go dormant again. If the collaborator model works and the kickstarter I set up gets funded, I think I&#x27;ll be able to stretch things a lot farther. I do a very intensive process with anyone who contributes their work, but at this point it&#x27;s still <i>much</i> easier for me to collaborate with someone who&#x27;s contributing ONE article to Practicing Ruby than it is for me to research and write ten more pages when I&#x27;ve already produced something like 1000 pages of work.<p>So in a way, the death knell rang, and that&#x27;s what motivated me to try to fix the business problems. In the process of doing that, I remembered the motivation for doing the project in the first place (which was to provide a functional example of a top-notch free documentation project), and that&#x27;s what got me excited about things again.<p>Who knows what will happen from here? Maybe the project will still die. But either way, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll learn a lot from it.",1433457009

Because of the speed of light this assures the key is within a certain distance of the car. Ideally you want to constrain this to ~2 meters since passive entry requires the driver to touch the door handle. This limit is not to be confused with remote keyless entry which should work up to ~100 meters as it requires the driver to actively press a button so, like garage door openers, this is not vulnerable to relay attacks. However power-constrained MCUs, especially in the key, have a hard time computing a strong cryptographic challenge within N nanoseconds with N low enough, hence the problem...<p>After my little foray into garage door openers I am currently looking into implementing relay attacks on the passive entry / passive go system of my car (2012 Audi).

While linear algebra suffices for a lot of these applications, the rabbit hole goes pretty deep past calculus and basic statistics. The central skill I&#x27;ve found useful is simply learning to read mathematics in a productive way (it&#x27;s not like any other kind of reading you&#x27;ve ever done before, though if pressed I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s closest to reading dense software documentation).<p>In image processing, you can cleverly manipulate graphics [2], make &quot;hybrid images&quot; [3] and digital watermarks [4], and do procedural content generation [5].<p>While we all know graphs are ubiquitous in algorithms (searching, ranking, data structures, etc), you can also do fun things like finding communities [6] and turning &quot;hard&quot; computational problems into neat games [7] (or vice versa).<p>You can do cryptography and cryptanalysis [8], hunt serial killers [9], share secrets [10], compute cheap and healthy diets [11], design markets [12], detect and recognize faces [13], and all sorts of other things (my blog just has examples I happen to think are fun, ignoring many examples that are actually lucrative).<p>More generally by studying math you learn to tell what problems should be attacked with what tools. You learn that any time anything exhibits symmetry it should be studied with groups [13]. Or that with some elbow grease you can solve lots of problems (like register allocation) by doing graph coloring [14] or linear programming [11] or some basic Fourier analysis [15]. The more you learn the more you get to think about, like &quot;the shape of data&quot; [16].<p>And before you know it you&#x27;re like me and you think algorithms with elegant mathematical analyses are beautiful and worth studying for their own sake. You give up your overpaid software career, get a PhD in math, and wonder if you&#x27;ll ever have enough time to learn everything you want to know.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://jeremykun.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeremykun.com/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://jeremykun.com/2013/03/04/seam-carving-for-content-aware-image-scaling/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeremykun.com/2013/03/04/seam-carving-for-content-awa...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://jeremykun.com/2014/09/29/hybrid-images/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeremykun.com/2014/09/29/hybrid-images/</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://jeremykun.com/2013/12/30/the-two-dimensional-fourier-transform-and-digital-watermarking/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeremykun.com/2013/12/30/the-two-dimensional-fourier-...</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise</a><p>[6]: <a href=""http://jeremykun.com/2014/05/19/community-detection-in-graphs-a-casual-tour/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeremykun.com/2014/05/19/community-detection-in-graph...</a><p>[7]: <a href=""http://jeremykun.com/2014/03/17/want-to-make-a-great-puzzle-game-get-inspired-by-theoretical-computer-science/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeremykun.com/2014/03/17/want-to-make-a-great-puzzle-...</a><p>[8]: <a href=""http://jeremykun.wordpress.com/2012/02/03/cryptanalysis-with-n-grams/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeremykun.wordpress.com/2012/02/03/cryptanalysis-with...</a><p>[9]: <a href=""http://jeremykun.com/2011/07/20/serial-killers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeremykun.com/2011/07/20/serial-killers/</a><p>[10]: <a href=""http://jeremykun.com/2014/06/23/the-mathematics-of-secret-sharing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeremykun.com/2014/06/23/the-mathematics-of-secret-sh...</a><p>[11]: <a href=""http://jeremykun.com/2014/06/02/linear-programming-and-the-most-affordable-healthy-diet-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeremykun.com/2014/06/02/linear-programming-and-the-m...</a><p>[12]: <a href=""http://jeremykun.com/2014/04/02/stable-marriages-and-designing-markets/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeremykun.com/2014/04/02/stable-marriages-and-designi...</a><p>[13]: <a href=""http://jeremykun.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/groups-a-primer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeremykun.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/groups-a-primer/</a><p>[14]: <a href=""http://jeremykun.com/2011/07/14/graph-coloring-or-proof-by-crayon/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeremykun.com/2011/07/14/graph-coloring-or-proof-by-c...</a><p>[15]: <a href=""http://jeremykun.com/2012/05/27/the-fourier-transform-a-primer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeremykun.com/2012/05/27/the-fourier-transform-a-prim...</a><p>[16]: <a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/201101/rtx110100036p.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/201101/rtx110100036p.pdf</a>",1433456343

(Including the words I just said, see, about subsets.)<p>Specifically, a lot of computer science belongs to &quot;discrete mathematics&quot;, (because there are discrete states not a continuous interval of possibilities, but still math).  so even for everything where you thought you were just learning computer science - when you look at sorting, trees, big-O complexity, correctness, graphs, one-way functions, lexical parsing, network theory, control systems, error handling, compression, etc, you&#x27;re really just ... straight-up doing math, <i>by definition</i>. (or using a library, compiler, operating system, network stack, database engine etc, etc, etc, by someone who has.)  I mean that it is literally the field of mathematics.  Like when you remove two &#x27;not&#x27; in a row you are just straight-up literally doing math.<p>So firstly, I would say that these are just some of the things that are directly used by people practicing computer science, even if only second-hand - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics</a> - As well as the more specific, Oh, I heard it&#x27;s impossible to evaluate whether a function will terminate... oh...I heard you can&#x27;t compress random data at ALL on average... oh the shannon limit means we could never get that much data across this channel... wait, can you get the signal back after a fast Fourier transform - of course! that&#x27;s what an inverse fourier transform does..  ... can a simple regular expression match if parentheses are matched and only correctly nested - answer: not a REGULAR one - <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/133601/can-regular-expressions-be-used-to-match-nested-patterns"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/133601/can-regular-expres...</a> etc. etc.<p>you see this stuff everywhere.  but you just look it up and do it - well, it&#x27;s math! basically all of the &#x27;theoretical&#x27; stuff is.  so it&#x27;s not so much about finding parts of &#x27;math&#x27; that a computer scientist should know...it&#x27;s about realizing that most what you use (right down to boolean logic) is strictly math to begin with.  you&#x27;re <i>literally</i> (not metaphorically) doing math every single day, all day, every time you negate a boolean before returning it.<p>reasoning about database opreations? straight-up set theory.<p>so it&#x27;s like your real question is, what is the math that I would find useful if I learned it?  And the answer is - as a computer scientist, &quot;computer science&quot; is the math that you would find useful if you learned it . . .<p>the other stuff, like geometry or calculus, is interesting but a red herring - in a way they could be considered the application logic.  your calculus equations are only useful if your functions implementing them bother to ever return a value... you can hardly write two loops without at least thinking about time complexity.  bam, math.  <i>all the rest</i> of computer science is math too.  everything you do every day.  it is just part of mathematics.  so go ahead and learn more math - what part?  the &quot;computer science&quot; part :)",1433456125

(&quot;Microservices Architecture&quot; is the new SOA)<p>I answered that I would start with a monolith because usually you&#x27;re trying to find product/market fit as quickly as possible, and having an SOA would likely slow you down due to its upfront cost. (How many services? Any redundancy? What do they do? How many databases? How do you keep them up? How do you diagnose when they&#x27;re failing? etc)<p>They responded that they always do SOA, that the benefits are clear, that monolithic apps are idiotic, etc.<p>I didn&#x27;t want the job... but I was confused about our differing opinions.<p>What I&#x27;ve learned since then is basically: are you constructing a building, or making an art installation?<p>Construction is thousands of years old. Contractors have huge tables of how long each part of the process takes, in what order, down to the quarter-hour (in some cases) and are fairly accurate in their estimations. (They&#x27;re still hilariously wrong on occasion either in time or budget, building <i>anything</i> is pretty difficult)<p>In this case, architecting SOA would work out since you&#x27;ve done it before. You know about how long it takes, what the pitfalls are, what support infrastructure you need, etc.<p>When you&#x27;re making art, making something new, with new materials, without a manual, with only some best practices in mind, time becomes essentially unbounded.<p>Upfront architecture in this case would be poorly suited to the situation - you&#x27;ll probably end up changing it a lot, and each time you introduce a bit of &quot;rigor&quot; to the system it becomes a bit more difficult to change. Especially over socket boundaries and different API versions.<p>I also feel like bad code has a survivorship bias - you only hear about it because the company took off.

Your real question is, can this be done without `Symbol`?<p>And it can, since the symbol is just a secret stored in a closure and there are other sorts of secrets. Aside from the &quot;Math.random() + {enumerable: false}&quot; suggestion found elsewhere, you can reproduce the precise[0] semantics of your example using something like:<p><pre><code>    // Please do not actually write code like this
    var Person = (function() {
      var names = [];
      function Person(name) {
        this.key = names.length;

      return Person;
    })();

      names = []

        names[@key] = name
      sameName: (other)->
        names[other.key] is names[@key]

Of course these implementations do something dramatically different behind the scenes, and I emphatically don&#x27;t think people should follow this example, but the interface is the same.

We&#x27;ll leave that bit as an exercise, though.<p>Whether `names[this.key]` is as &quot;nice&quot; to work with as `this[nameKey]` is, uh, left up to the reader; personally, count me in the camp that doing either of those things is nuttypants compared to `this._name`.<p>[0]: Assuming that `otherPerson` in your constructor is a typo, of course ;P",1433455786

LWN segments their free/paid offerings by time.  One could argue that there&#x27;s another, missing category: review/summary articles which contextualize the perishable content and extract implications for long-lived assumptions.<p>On one hand, there are ecosystem-wide benefits from removing financial barriers to entry, e.g. free and high-quality content on foundational principles, proven over time by competition between many alternatives.  On the other hand, there is economic value to be created from high-quality synthesis, for audiences which can afford and apply this synthesis to immediate commercial problems.<p>How can we segment these two audiences?  Softcover.io seems to have been successful, with the Rails tutorial as one data point with substantial revenue (6 figures) even though the core  content was free to read.",1433455645

The locks on your house are almost certainly bumpable.  The locks at your workplace might be more secure.<p>That&#x27;s fine, though.  If you make the lock on your front door more secure, the weak point is now the latching mechanism, the door frame, or the door itself.  Or perhaps it is your sliding patio door, that can be levered.  Maybe you left a window unlocked.  Or your garage door has a code that can be MITM&#x27;ed or brute forced.<p>The thing that saves most people is that there is really nothing worth stealing in their house.  If a fence pays 10% of retail for stolen goods, I&#x27;m not certain there is any single thing in my home worth more than $25 to a burglar, other than the emergency cash.

Many companies, large and small, make decisions that result in a change of direction or focus. The results of those changes may mean that some of roles are no longer needed.

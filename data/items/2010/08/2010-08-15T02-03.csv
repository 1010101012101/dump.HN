A quick browse of the 4foods website gives a picture of a fast food company that might actually be able to serve healthy food, unlike most of the competition.<p>Because you can plan your food online beforehand, you can 'design' food which is more healthy than anything mcdonalds would be willing to give menu space for. Not to mention you don't have to rely on their people to come up with healthy options.<p>Always take what these companies say with a grain of salt, but here are a few quotes from their site.<p>""Fresh, local produce is transformed into our menu offerings in the Community Kitchen Commissary-a vocational training center.""<p>""We upgrade food that people already eat-burgers, nuggets, fries, salads and teas - transforming them into new menu items that are convenient, and almost infinitely customizable to our guests' lifestyles and cultural preferences. Our food is measurably healthier than existing products.""<p>""Our restaurants are designed to function as community hubs, as they satisfy local appetites in healthy, customizable ways.""<p>It uses social networking to spread, crowd-sources the meals, has a new take on transparency as far as ingredients are concerned and - very importantly for something you are going to spend money on - sounds like fun.",1281841065

is not a structure available to you in Node.js, again, pending somebody proving otherwise in Javascript (though I've made this complaint in other places where somebody really should have shown me the code). That expands to tons of code in Javascript, code which is very resistant to abstraction.<p>Your code block says it is available to you in Ruby. There's no reason why it shouldn't be; it's not a hard compiler transform to manage that. Taking code that looks like a ""thread"" but compiling it into events and using something-like-continuations to keep the stack together is on the order of a homework problem. Based on what I know about Ruby, the responsibility of those pieces is split up differently but all the pieces must be there. But it's not something Javascript can do (quite yet, and based on what I've seen in Python the 'yield' approach has its own issues).",1281839283

I read about TLAPS. It seems it relies on SMT solver to uncharge proof obligations, and no way for you to manually prove your claim using lower level tactics, like in Coq. So you rely on heuristic nature of SMT solver.<p>About Spin[1]. If you compare the user base of Spin with the user base of TLA+ I bet you will wonder how many users out there were using verification tools all those years. Lamport released his tool like 20 years later than SPIN started to spread. He did a great job, but there is no innovation in my opinion.<p>I think that serious industry players like Intel, Google or NASA are using all spectre of verification tools, including self written tools. Intel is using there own tool for some of their chip verification AFAIK. My colleague went into Intel to help develop verification scripts using this tool.<p>TLA+ has been promoted by Amazon with their latest technical report. Yes, it has more expressive types (records,tuples,sets), but it comes with a cost of lowering your verification performance rate. There are many subtle tradeoffs to make.<p>We tried to use several formal verification tools in our latest distributed project. We tried Spin, TLA+, mCRL2, Coq. There is its own philosophy, pros and cons behind each tool, but in our case Spin made the best job: we had to invest not so much time but found many concurrency bugs in our distributed algorithm. Its pros is that it has very basic data types and not very good parallelism support nor in multi thread nor in multi-node form.<p>[1] <a href=""http://spinroot.com/spin/whatispin.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spinroot.com/spin/whatispin.html</a>",1442404491

Fun Fact: if you&#x27;re sophisticated enough to have an agricultural organophosphate pesticide plant making, say, malathion or diazinon (i.e. not particularly sophisticated), it&#x27;s a  straightforward process tweak using the similar chemical precursors to produce nerve agents like Sarin.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in more, the Wassenar agreement[2] is the framework within which dual-use non-proliferation is dealt with.  It&#x27;s kind of daunting to see how much industrial output is considered dual-use.<p>[1] One should, of course, always be dubious of claims like &quot;24 hrs&quot; out of context.

In addition, a MIPS M5150 CPU can run up to seven guest operating systems in parallel, with minimum overhead on overall system performance and stability.<p>Virtualization will help developers create new and more secure applications for wearables, IoT and other embedded markets. For example, a MIPS M-class CPU inside a smart home hub can place door and window locks in separate virtualized containers to avoid compromised security throughout the home while a separate container can handle lighting control or the connectivity stack; any change in the operation of a container would not affect the others.<p>You can see this use case demonstrated below on a MIPS-based development board; when the Linux-based operating system running in one virtualized container restarts, the second container controlling the motor operation continues running unaffected.

Over here in the UK there is precedent that lawyers for e.g. speculative invoice cases involving copyright claims (also know as copyright trolling) can have their right to practise law revoked if the claims are found to be spurious.

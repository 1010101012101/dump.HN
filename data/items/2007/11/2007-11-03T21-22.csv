75856,comment,75761,75779,0,0,shiro,,,"""Genius is simply the release of the inner spark.""<p>Good remark.  I think you still need effort, but that's the kind of removing obstacles between the spark and the outcome, rather than the kind of blindly digging here and there hoping you'll find a gem.  I guess that's the reason of the importance of the mentor mentioned in the article.<p>And yes, it's simple, yet so difficult to achieve for even a slight bit of ego, lazyness or even over-eagerness get in the way... (from my experience of >20yrs of practicing instruments and acting; yet there's long way to go).  ",1194126309

It had been blown open in the wind. <p>It was interesting to watch because it was clear that the robot didn't know what to do to get around it. This was probably because it was at an intersection, so it was seeing the gate and the stop line. The bot had its turn signal on, so it new that it was at the intersection. <p>After watching the bots religiously adhere to traffic rules, it was an interesting comparison to watch the course officials speeding down the road to remove the obstacle.",1194126216

You can involve a third person and go 49-49-2 so that you have a tie-breaker (or 49.99-49.99-0.02). Packard was 60% and Hewlett was 40% as an FYI. <p>The advice to do a vesting schedule (or a buyback/unvesting) is also good. You need to look beyond just this one person and think about what other ""hats"" or capabilities you are going to need to achieve your objectives. You may want to setup an option agreement. But you are going need to create some kind of company, and should consult with an attorney.<p>Denny Miu's advice to reach a ""meeting of the minds"" first and expressing it in plain English is spot on, don't rely on an attorney to help you reach an agreement with a partner, rely on an attorney to point out risks and issues that you may not have considered (e.g. setting up a buy-sell agreement).<p>Many more companies fail from a lack of customer development than product development so finding a partner who can help balance your strengths and offering them a substantial chunk of equity is not unreasonable.<p>I hope this helps./SeanM <a href=""http://www.skmurphy.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skmurphy.com</a> ",1194125691

Current order is Little Ben (Ben Franklin), Talos (MIT), Skynet (Cornell).<p>I think to this point there have only been 2 collisions, both involving Talos. They were relatively minor and clearly did not cause a DQ or cause any noticeable difference in behavior.<p>This is an impressive leap in technology from the Grand Challenge. At this point, I think that the remaining three are going to finish too.",1194123634

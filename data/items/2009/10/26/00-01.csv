The thing is, when a group of developers decide to band together to try to develop something bigger, they all have to hurry to keep the momentum going, as there are more people who might quit due to running out of money, going to grad school, getting married, etc.  At the same time, the vision of the company should be bigger than that of a lone shareware author, such that it more than compensates for going-for-it-alone.<p>Many are happy to have a lifestyle business in addition to their full-time job, and feeling respected by posting on Joel on Software and these discussions.  Others have opportunities, either because they are young and have college friends, or are older with money saved up and a list of industry contacts, to jump in on a new idea together.

(I have had to deal with this personally.)<p>First, if you can become a member/poster on the forum with a rant against you, do it.  Post a reply that identifies you as associated with the product, and clarify whatever the customer has apparently misunderstood; or, if it is a bug, instruct the person on how to provide more information to have the problem fixed.  There is little chance that the fuming anonymous poster will ever see this, but they might; and either way, it shows others that you are doing your best to deal with the problem.<p>Second, forums sometimes have moderators who will accept complaints and remove remarks.  Rants are often obvious; for instance, if everyone except one fuming moron is giving you 5 stars, a moderator shouldn't have any problem removing the offending post.<p>And third, be vigilant.  It can be disheartening to have people publicly destroy your product, and sometimes all you can do is just keep working and make it better.  At some point, the bad press will fade.  It may well have caused some damage to your product's appeal in the short term, but in the long run your name will be considered one of the good brands.",1256517942

This kind of stuff really makes me angry.<p>Do you think when millions of starving Irish refugees turned up in the 1840s it didn't depress wages for existing American workers at the time? Or the Poles, or the Germans, or the dozens of other nationalities?<p>Immigration is an economic force which moves labour from areas of high supply to areas of high demand. The result, considered globally, is greater prosperity for everybody.<p>The American economy is and always has been fuelled by cheap labour in the form of unskilled immigration -- forget $30k, the people who <i>really</i> get the economy moving are doing shit work for $8/hour.<p>Lower wages means goods are cheaper, which means you can buy stuff that's cheaper, and when we export it we make more money. Lower wages are <i>GREAT</i> for the economy -- even, in the long run, for those in the industries affected, because their savings are bigger (cheaper stuff) and worth more (lower inflation), and their standard of living is higher (more stuff).<p>And it's as true in high tech as it is in blue-collar industries.<p>Saying you don't think there should be programmers working for $30k is exactly like those idiot auto workers who formed unions which demanded that they all be paid $60k/year to do the same assembly work people in Asia are doing for $30k. As a result, they're now either out of work or YOU are paying their ridiculous $60k wage out of your tax money after the bailouts. Not exactly the American Way.<p>Even if you shipped over every single able and willing programmer in India and China to California tomorrow wages wouldn't drop to $10/hour. There are just not that many programmers in the world.<p>But because some Americans are terrified that rampant immigration will mean they earn $95k instead of $100k/year, every time they get they opportunity they vote to make it harder for hard-working, skilled immigrants to enter and stay in this country. In so doing, they save that $5k but never earn the $50k they would have earned as the stock market rose on the strength of all that immigration-fuelled growth. But because you can't <i>see</i> money you never earn, few people complain.<p>Do you know how many H-1B visas (the most common skilled tech worker visa) are granted every year? 65,000. That's 0.02% of the population. You could let in 10 times as many people every year and nobody would even notice.<p>America's anti-immigration policies are stupid and self-defeating on a purely economic analysis, before you even get into the issue of a nation of white immigrants suddenly deciding that immigration is bad because the new guys are all brown.",1256517672

Borrow liberally from others -- especially open source code -- because that's the quickest way to success.  Why waste time rewriting stuff that others have written, when that'll take three times as long and require lots of testing?  (impatience)<p>3. Eventually write your own version anyway, because you can do better than the other guy.  (hubris)<p>The first is what ensures you're writing software that should be written.<p>The second is what ensures that you write robust software with reasonable efficiency, and what protects you from getting a reputation as someone who badly implements a lot of cruft that someone else has already done better.<p>The third is what ensures that you improve as a programmer, rather than just getting into the tired rut of playing Legos with other people's libraries and never learning anything new.",1256516695

902387,comment,901710,901710,0,0,bkovitz,,,"The first rule of programming is indeed ""don't program"".  But that's not because buying off-the-shelf code makes you more productive than writing code yourself.  It's because software solutions are usually worse than manual solutions.<p>Here's a typical example, one I just ran into today.  For a course, I need to enter some data into some system that stores grades.  It doesn't just store grades, though, it tries to calculate grades--by various rules and heuristics, which you are likely to misunderstand.  They have written a lot of code for the import process, to, you know, take the burden off the poor teacher, by calculating the grades.<p>Of course, it's such a pain, and so error-prone, the much easier solution would be to just make a spreadsheet containing the grades and upload it, and have the program do nothing but display the results or whatever actually needs to be done.  That would remove 95% of the code written for this thing.  And make it work better.<p>Another one, which I ran into a few weeks ago.  I needed to add a class.  The professor needed to approve it.  The software was so confusing, the prof couldn't figure it out (he is a world-renowned professor of computer science, BTW).  After a couple weeks of this, I finally got a sheet of paper and had him sign it.  I brought that sheet to the expert in operating the mysterious System, and that finally got the job done.<p><i>Some</i> software does obviously help the university run better.

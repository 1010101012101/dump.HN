I suggest that the ""intention of the guideline"" is to reduce cluttering the site with meta-discussion, and it would serve this purpose best if  <i>comment</i> was construed as including a <i>submission</i>.<p>(2). in terms of the ""letter of the guideline"", what is the meaning of the words <i>comments</i> and <i>submissions</i>? The guidelines have separate sections for each, and clearly use the terminology used else on the site, which talks of <i>comments</i> on articles and articles that are <i>submitted</i>. A broader construction of ""comments"" as ""things that comment on other things"" is not the literal meaning.<p>Therefore, I agree that the excerpt about comments does not include submissions, and I was wrong. However, I think it <i>should</i> include submissions. :-) Another argument is that submissions about the site are not ""On-topic"", by this definition:<p><i>On-Topic: Anything that good hackers would find interesting. That includes more than hacking and startups. If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity.</i><p>I'm not sure that complaining about the site, and attempting to modify other people's behaviour, gratifies one's intellectual curiosity (in contrast, a discussion about how a social site can be run does do this).<p>However, I think in future, I might leave all such discussions to my betters, and focus on things that I find interesting, instead of trying to ""improve"" the site.",1222160246

312212,comment,311146,311146,0,0,strlen,,,"The real problem with PHP is that (despite the ability to run it from command line, etc...) a language centered around web application. That's also it's greatest strength: it's seamless and easy to integrate with Apache.<p>I wonder why the author wouldn't consider Perl: powerful Apache integration (mod_perl), performance and great deal of expressive power. A PHP code monkey could be trained to modify Perl and the presence of powerful and mature testing tools (e.g. Test::More) and common libraries (DBI, myriad of XML libraries, template libraries, etc...) can minimize the amount of damage a junior coder will do.<p>(And if you're unable to use mod_perl, using CGI::Fast suffices for most cases and is trivial with mod_fastcgi).",1222158921

He's paying $60/week + food, so $100/week would be more like $7/meal (assuming breakfast isn't a fully cooked meal since eggs/pancakes don't cook so well).

Millions of years of evolution have built our brains and bodies for interacting with things that provide physical feedback when we touch them. Waving a pencil in the air, ""manipulating"" an invisible item and looking for visual feedback from a screen, these are not good experiences. Even if you discount the ""gorilla arm syndrome"" that StavrosK quite rightly points out here, the fatigue of trying to perform fine and accurate motion without physical stimuli for your hands and fingers to respond to is significant.<p>I'm sorry to be a negative voice in the face of innovation, but this really does feel like a technology in search of a problem. What worries me greatly is that it has a remarkably high ""cool factor"" that would be excellent in short demos, and could be easily pitched to companies looking for a flashy feature to get a leg up on the competition. We were saddled with some dubious decisions at the dawn of the GUI age, and we're just starting to lose them as we enter the Direct Manipulation age of interfaces. Please don't let this concept of feedback-free hand gestures become a paradigm that we're stuck with in the future.",1345636549

4416858,comment,4416486,4416486,4,0,rcamera,,,"I've lived recently through a experience in which I failed to convince the founders into making me a co-founder. Two very successful entrepreneurs (with many successful exits, one of which worth hundreds of millions of dollars) invited me a couple months ago to join them to work in their idea. I started working part-time at first, getting to know them, and from day one, I stated I wanted to be their co-founder, not employee. I tried to stay part-time until I was more sure of how working with them would be like.<p>We assembled a team, refined the vision and were then negotiating how everyone would join it, so we could build the MVP. I was ready to work full-time, but suddenly, they were trying to reason with me that % of equity doesn't matter, what matters is the number of shares you own, and tried to offer me a regular salary + options (not even a decent salary). I tried to convince them about why % matters, and why it was fair for me to get equity, but then they told me that this model doesn't work when they are the investors who are going to put millions of dollars into the company, having effectively the control of dilution over me.<p>I proposed ideas that would take care of the dilution problem, but it was no good, they weren't really listening to me, using the same arguments over and over. This was the first red flag that raised in my head, and later, we started disagreeing on how to build the company (I was showing them how the Customer Development Model works, showed them the canvas from business model generation and all). I noticed they had very strong beliefs on how to do it, and weren't willing to discuss it with me. That's when the illusion popped and I noticed, I wasn't a co-founder, and ended up getting a call a week ago with them saying that ""maybe I wasn't ready to face the risks of starting up"" and that I shouldn't participate in the meeting later that day... It's a shame, I liked the team, and the idea was quite interesting, but no way I would put 4-6 years of my life into this without being a co-founder.<p>In retrospect, I think that what caused our issues was mostly the fact that they never had another co-founder and all of their previous startups were bootstrapped. So when I asked equity, they likely saw it as too risky, even though we worked together and they saw my determination and skills.",1345636045

For the CS students, what this means is that the number of children you have personally, even assuming they all reproduce, rapidly becomes immaterial next to the number of your descendants.<p>The only reason having more children might be beneficial is if it significantly increases the odds that they personally, or their children successfully reproduce. If you have some other way of boosting those odds -- say, by being a successful parent to a smaller number of children -- that's just as good in the long run.",1345636029

I was the co-founder of other start-ups before joining my latest company and had hired ""first employees"" myself.  So I understood the difference and knew what I was getting myself into.  IMO, the choice depends on your personality, what you like to do, and where you are in your life.<p>There are two key factors that made me accept the first employee offer.<p>1. As a co-founder you will need to take part in some of the administrative part of the company.  Even if another one of the founders is taking care of the operations, there will always be things like board meetings, financing, taxes, etc.  As a co-founder it has always been my opinion that you need to be interested in the operations.  It's your duty to be informed as a co-founder.<p>2. Family.  When I accepted my position I was a point in my life where I had two small children and a wife that wanted to pursue her own career.  As a first employee I had the opportunity to ""request"" that my office hours were 9 to 5.

My family was more important to me then being a co-founder.<p>I'm currently the CTO of the company (360pi.com) I joined as the first employee.  For me it was a great decision at the time.

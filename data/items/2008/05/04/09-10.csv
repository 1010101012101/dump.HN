Sure, with enough data, we might be able to find spelling mistakes or figure out what pictures someone is looking for.<p>But the techniques we are looking for don't address <i>understanding</i>, (granted they never set out to). Most interesting would be to define <i>meaning</i> and <i>understanding</i>, using strict mathematical models. As McCarty said, language is just the froth on those waves.",1209895061

Given the computational infrastructure available at Google, it would seem that it's the only place where one would be free to try all kinds of ideas unavailable elsewhere.

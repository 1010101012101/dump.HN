8719487,comment,8711261,8714660,0,0,dredmorbius,,,"That&#x27;s a possibility, but the bigger problem is simply the size of the solar system.<p>Uranus is 2.88 billion km from the Sun.<p>Neptune is 4.5 billion km from the Sun.  Nearly twice as far as Uranus.<p>Pluto is 5.9 billion km from the Sun on average.  It varies a lot, from inside the orbit of Neptune to nearly double the distance - 4.4 to 7.3 billion km.  New Horizons will be reaching it at one of its nearer approaches.  Pluto is also significantly inclined to the solar plane, unlike the planets.<p>By contrast Jupiter is less than 1 billion km away:  0.779 billion km.<p>Saturn is 1.4 billion km -- twice as far as Jupiter.<p>Note that if you managed to slow yourself down at Neptune on your way out to Pluto, <i>you&#x27;d still have the distance from the Sun to Saturn to traverse</i>.  Say you cut half your speed -- it would take you nearly six and a half years to reach Pluto, rather than the 3.2 of the current mission trajectory.  You&#x27;re trading speed and time here.<p>And you&#x27;d <i>still</i> have to lose some 20,000 km/h of velocity when you arrived.<p>Space is big.  Really big.  You won&#x27;t believe just how vastly, hugely, mind bogglingly big it is.<p>Then there&#x27;s the orbital periods.  Neptune&#x27;s year is nearly 165 Earth years, Uranus is 84 years, Pluto&#x27;s is nearly 248 years.  This means that Pluto, discovered in 1930, won&#x27;t have completed a full orbit of the Sun until 2177.  Neptune, discovered in 1846, completed its first full orbit since only in 2010.",1418075960

All my shortcuts were different from Eclipse, and the whole module structure wasn&#x27;t as intuitive for me (I stayed away from IntelliJ too). However, after using it for the last 6 months, I have to say, it is a huge improvement for Android Development. There are soo many slick IDE features, like icon previews to the left of the editor, smart code collapsing (done automatically by the IDE without modifying the source), preview&#x27;s on text resources, UI preview&#x27;s that put Eclipse + ADT to shame, and very very nice gradle integration.<p>And at this point I freaking love gradle over Ant.

8719463,comment,8718066,8719081,0,0,hackuser,,,"Thanks, this is a much more interesting discussion.<p>> I&#x27;m not saying that discrimination shouldn&#x27;t be pointed out, I&#x27;m merely in support of substantiating such claims with good evidence.<p>Agreed. I think 5 out of 5 white male authors is not great evidence, and in something this sensitive and well-discussed, we should be careful. However, awareness is really the central issue (see below) which is why I like the original comment -- though clearly it should be carefully expressed!<p>----<p>> &quot;Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence&quot; and all that, and if the discrimination isn&#x27;t blatant (like early 1900&#x27;s US racism)<p>In my opinion, the evidence is very strong: Look at the dominance of white males in our society, in business, in government (look at a group photo of Congress -- notice something statistically odd?), in our culture, etc. When white males are only (33%?) of the population, I think the evidence is overwhelming that some sort of widespread discrimination must exist to explain the outcomes. Add to that our history of discrimination against these very same groups, minorities and women, and personally I am convinced that discrimination occurs widely even if specific situations are hard to prove. It&#x27;s not as bad as 1900 or 1950, but it&#x27;s still a very serious problem -- I can just talk about it, but it&#x27;s a very real problem for those who live it every day, with every job they apply to, with every social situation, every store they walk into, etc. etc.<p>Also, anecdotally, many white people I know privately repeat the old racial and gender stereotypes (and I don&#x27;t seek out that crowd).<p>----<p>> If you were in a situation where you were randomly accused for something as serious as racism, you&#x27;d probably want your accuser to provide a good argument for it too.<p>Most importantly, I think being racist is the human condition. We all do it, me too. It&#x27;s in our nature to be tribal and to dehumanize others. It&#x27;s like being accused of being a sinner or having bugs in your code (not to trivialize racism): Of course I do; the question, is what do I do about it.<p>Awareness is the key I think, and many who study the issue say the same. Few want to discriminate, it&#x27;s just that we&#x27;re all naturally blind to it. That tribal instinct has a very unfortunate coincidence of properties: We are naturally a little blind, and it is the cause of the worst of what humanity does to itself: Generations of oppression for women, black teens getting shot, wars of genocide, reckless invasions of other countries, etc. etc.",1418075681

8719460,comment,8716538,8716538,0,0,JackC,,,"This is fantastic! We were just noticing how segregated our own neighborhood near Boston is, and wondering what drives that and what could be done about it. You can see the same thing all over the city -- neighborhoods that are much more white than average right next to neighborhoods that are much less white than average.<p>Really interesting that this could be self-generated with very little bias (setting aside that there&#x27;s definitely still some intentional housing discrimination in Boston). And really interesting that it could potentially be reversed if people started to avoid neighborhoods that are highly segregated in their &quot;favor.&quot;<p>I wonder if integration could be advertised as a benefit of certain properties on real estate sites like Zillow. What would happen if home listings had a &quot;well integrated neighborhood&quot; indicator for neighborhoods that have about the same racial balance as the larger area, the same way they have indicators for good schools and public transportation and so on? Would that be appealing to actual buyers the same way it&#x27;s appealing to the Polygons in the model?<p>The risk is that an index like that could be used to <i>encourage</i> segregation instead -- but I&#x27;m hopeful that, on average, we&#x27;re better than that at this point.<p>Here&#x27;s one census map if you want to check out your neighborhood:<p><a href=""http://www.socialexplorer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.socialexplorer.com/</a><p>You can show racial data under &quot;Change Data.&quot; We also found it helpful to change &quot;Show data by: Tract&quot; to &quot;Block group&quot; (more fine-grained), and to use quantile cutpoints under the color palette menu.",1418075638

8719445,comment,8718596,8719276,0,0,milen,,,"> The only real argument to be made here is claiming that 3rd-party apps should be able to ship on the MAS without being sandboxed, but that runs counter to the entire purpose of the MAS and will never happen.<p>The argument that I&#x27;ve been making for years is that proper entitlements should have existed for all the functionality necessary before the requirement for all apps to be sandboxed was introduced.<p>> The only really useful thing to actually try and get Apple to change is to expand the sandboxing capabilities to allow certain things that 3rd-party apps want to do and cannot do today. They&#x27;ve added more and more capabilities over time. The question is what functionality can be effectively exposed to sandboxed apps without opening up a security hole.<p>Exactly, that&#x27;s what should have been happening and has been to some extent but not aggressively enough. Part of the problem is that a lot of things pose no security threats but there are still no way to access that functionality in a sandboxed app - that&#x27;s the crux of the problem.<p>In the case of GaragePay, it used an external utility to deal with encrypted disk images. The app has already been given access to the file via the powerbox [1], there is no additional security threat. Unfortunately, there are no APIs to operate on such disk images except the external hdiutil utility. The correct way to have resolved this was to expose APIs to access that functionality or else allow a temporary exception until such APIs exist.<p>> That functionality should never have been in the MAS app to begin with.<p>Why shouldn&#x27;t it be? In almost all cases, the functionality can be sandboxed if Apple provided an API to access it securely but there just isn&#x27;t a entitlement for those cases - not because it&#x27;s not possible but because it&#x27;s just not implemented.<p>> Also note that the claim &quot;Apple shouldn&#x27;t apply that rule, because it removes app functionality, and that&#x27;s bad for users&quot; is quite ridiculous.<p>I never claimed that. I only claimed that removing functionality objectively leads to an inferior experience due to the lack of said features. In an ideal world, the correct way to have gone about it would be to provide the necessary security mechanisms to make that possible. While Apple did add additional entitlements over the years, there are still many operations that reasonable and do not pose a security threat that are still not supported.<p>> If your app requires violating app store rules for certain functionality, then you shouldn&#x27;t be using the MAS as your distribution channel.<p>While that&#x27;s true a statement, that&#x27;s not the crux of the problem. The root issue is that if the required entitlements were available, then the app wouldn&#x27;t be violating any rules at all and we wouldn&#x27;t even be having this conversation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_dialog#Powerbox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_dialog#Powerbox</a>",1418075519

It is part of a fuller panoply, but not complete in and of itself. A step further would be segmentation (and subsequent addressing) of one&#x27;s audience—be they patrons, regular customers, or casual viewers/listeners/readers. Create flexible, multiple ways for people to get to, consume, and pay for your content. Experiment with different channels, different messaging, different price points, and <i>different versions</i> of your content for those channels. Essentially, what you&#x27;re doing is allowing consumers to segment themselves, by opting into the types of content (and according price points) that best fit their needs.<p>This is different from a classic up-sell strategy. Up-selling is offering everyone the same baseline, then either encouraging or goading people into paying for &quot;value-adds.&quot; Instead, consider that your audience is heterogeneous in terms of what it wants, what it likes about you, which aspects of your content (or you) it values most, and what it considers those aspects to be worth. One size does not fit all. So sell more than one size.<p>[Note that this is <i>not</i> an inducement to cheat people. Don&#x27;t try to pawn off the exact same content at different price points on different channels. If you&#x27;re going to segment-and-address, you need to customize for each segment. Kickstarter campaign structures, for example, offer a decent framework by which to do this.]",1418075233

In this specific case, the driver turned off the GPS, and took a detour. At the very least, these incidents should have triggered alerts on their internal monitoring systems. And, assuming they had an agreement with cellular service providers for public safety, they could have tracked of the location of the female rider through her cellphone, and dispatched cops to that location.<p>Precisely for the reasons you mentioned in your blog post about how things can be gamed in India through bribes, Uber should have been careful about expanding in India. Asking the drivers to provide a conduct certificate in a corrupt country like India is a &quot;cover your ass&quot; move to precisely brandish this certificate and say - &quot;Hey, see, we did our homework. It is not our fault&quot; in situations like this.<p>This was an opportunity for them to raise the bar. This is a leadership failure. They were too eager to just expand overseas. They could have used technology to mitigate such risks in the &quot;rape capital&quot; of India (world?). Some things I think they can do as a technology company in India<p>- Install custom GPS trackers which cannot be turned off manually on the cars.<p>- Install a special audio/video cam in the car, and automatic audio/video feed analysis for distress screams, struggle.<p>- Automatic algorithmic tracking of the car route/de-tours<p>Like I said, they had a golden opportunity to showcase how technology could be used to mitigate the risk of such incidents in Delhi, and used it in their marketing. They could have raised the bar. They could have shown how it is done. They could have made the world safer and better. This is what separates the great from the good. Larry Page calls them Moonshots.

Of course, this adds short-term costs (which may sometimes be unacceptable) and requires a lot of behavior change for how people are used to working.  I will say that we put a lot of thought into giving you the fidelity of interaction such that you can still make &quot;breakthroughs from your errors&quot; on Transcriptic, and improving those reporting capabilities are an ever-ongoing process.<p>I&#x27;ll also say that this challenge is bigger than just one company. Some things may make more sense to do via Science Exchange, for example if the method requires some very customized hardware or there are only a few experts in the world who are sufficiently familiar with an unusual method&#x27;s sensitivities.  I&#x27;m also excited to see what Riffyn comes out with to help labs understand where reproducibility comes from.

The existence of non-sandboxed Apple software on the MAS does not impact 3rd-party MAS software in any way, shape, or form.<p>Basically, the goal of the MAS is to be able to sell software that users can implicitly trust to not be harmful. For Apple software, users can trust it because it&#x27;s Apple. For 3rd-party software, the only way to ensure the trustworthiness is to require sandboxing. Apple software should be sandboxed when possible, because that minimizes the downside of certain classes of software bugs, but beyond that one scenario, there&#x27;s no reason to care whether Apple software is sandboxed.<p>Yes, there are certain classes of 3rd-party software that cannot be shipped on the MAS because of sandboxing. But Apple allowing their own software to ship un-sandboxed has no bearing on this. The sandboxing requirement would prevent this 3rd-party software from shipping on the MAS regardless of whether Apple sandboxed their own apps.<p>The only real argument to be made here is claiming that 3rd-party apps should be able to ship on the MAS without being sandboxed, but that runs counter to the entire purpose of the MAS and will never happen.<p>The only really useful thing to actually try and get Apple to change is to expand the sandboxing capabilities to allow certain things that 3rd-party apps want to do and cannot do today. They&#x27;ve added more and more capabilities over time. The question is what functionality can be effectively exposed to sandboxed apps without opening up a security hole.<p>> The request to remove functionality due to (M)AS rules leads to an inferior experience for customers, as those customers can longer access that functionality.<p>That functionality should never have been in the MAS app to begin with. In the case of GaragePay I&#x27;m assuming they used a temporary sandbox exception, as Apple allowed those when sandboxing was new to give 3rd-party apps time to adapt, and to find out what exemptions were commonly requested in order to figure out in what ways the sandbox needed to be extended. If that&#x27;s the case, then GaragePay&#x27;s developer should have known from day 1 that they&#x27;d eventually have to remove this functionality (assuming the sandbox would eventually allow for invoking `hdiutil` should have been obviously unlikely from the start).<p>In most publicized cases, the app that gets the rejection that requires removing functionality was always in violation of the rule, and were just hoping to not get noticed. Sometimes that works, sometimes they get caught. And when caught obviously violating an existing rule, there really should be no surprise at all that Apple requires compliance with the rule. And there should be no outrage either, or claims that Apple should allow the app to continue violating the rule. The only really valid argument here is that Apple should be consistent in applying the rules, and I think everybody (including Apple) agrees on that point.<p>It&#x27;s the cases where Apple rejects an app for what many believe is an improper application of a rule that deserves community outrage. In this case, I think the App Store reviewer is incorrectly applying rules meant for regular document storage as if it had anything to do with iCloud Drive. But please note that Panic is not asking for community outrage. They&#x27;re just explaining to their users why the functionality is gone. I expect they&#x27;re taking the right steps privately, talking to the Review Board and whatnot.<p>Also note that the claim &quot;Apple shouldn&#x27;t apply that rule, because it removes app functionality, and that&#x27;s bad for users&quot; is quite ridiculous. Apple not consistently applying certain rules is the #1 complaint people tend to have with the App Store review policies. And claiming that &quot;user functionality&quot; is so holy that it must be preserved even when it obviously violates the rules makes no sense. The fact that an app manages to sneak rule violations past the review board in the past does not in any way mean it should be able to do so in the future, and the fact that an app relies on rule violations in order to provide functionality does not mean it <i>deserves</i> to be able to violate the rules.<p>> It means that if you want to distribute via MAS, you have to cripple (or remove) part of your app&#x27;s functionality in order to pass review. Again, nothing inherently wrong with that but the net effect is that your software might be inferior when distributed via the MAS vs outside.<p>If your app requires violating app store rules for certain functionality, then you shouldn&#x27;t be using the MAS as your distribution channel. It&#x27;s that simple.<p>> I don&#x27;t know how you came up with that, it was never said nor implied in any way whatsoever.<p>That was the subject of the immediately prior sentence. It provided the context for the subsequent sentence, and was the natural choice for the meaning of the word &quot;it&quot;, except in that it didn&#x27;t make much sense. Which is why I asked for clarification.",1418073746

It does what I need and I&#x27;d like to stay with it for a while longer.<p>Android Studio is fanciful, I used it for months during the beta. There is one gotcha which leads me to prefer Eclipse. In Eclipse, the compile process is much more integrated with the IDE. The compile step appears to happen inside the IDE app/process tree/whatever. In JetBrains, the compile process is a separate process, much more disconnected from the IDE. Hence JetBrains takes more memory and is slower and running a project build and getting errors back into the IDE. I can appreciate an external build process being flexible for Jetbrains to use their IDE with nearly any language/compiler, but Eclipse worked much faster overall on a 4GB ram setup.",1418073639

Males that made dubious pitches on the other hand were just canned outright. Yet the percentages of books published by females was still low, and there&#x27;s not much that can be done about that from the publishing end if there simply aren&#x27;t enough females interested in authoring for that genre.<p>Additionally, there is no reason why liking books by male authors over female authors (or vice-versa) in certain genres should be sexist. There have been studies showing that consumers can relate better to characters and such that share their same gender/culture than those that don&#x27;t. Similarly, there are studies that students learn better from teachers that also share their same gender/culture. It&#x27;s hard to say what exactly causes this right now, but it&#x27;s not a stretch to suggest that perhaps males will simply enjoy reading/relating with authors more if they share a similar perspective.<p>Also, actively going out of your way to <i>only</i> read books by male authors in all genres is definitely a sign of some kind of sexism, and I have no idea why you&#x27;re positioning it as something could even be <i>remotely interpreted</i> as &#x27;less sexist&#x27; than merely liking books by authors that share a common ground with you.

As I mentioned multiple times, it&#x27;s Apple&#x27;s platform, they make the rules and can do whatever they want but this means that there are certain classes of software that cannot be distributed via the MAS by 3rd parties, only by Apple as they are not bound by the same rules.<p>> What does?

Doubtful.<p>I don&#x27;t know how you came up with that, it was never said nor implied in any way whatsoever.<p>> What do you mean, without leaving them a choice?<p>It means that if you want to distribute via MAS, you have to cripple (or remove) part of your app&#x27;s functionality in order to pass review.

I point out that they are the angry comments because it seems that those people are defensive, jumping to conclusions and acting out. (Yes, some people get overheated in the other direction, but I don&#x27;t see that here.)<p>That a big reason that it&#x27;s hard to discuss these issues intelligently and move forward. People are defensive, and to be honest, today on places like HN it is far more trendy and &#x27;politically correct&#x27; to shout down the mention of discrimination. You can see people angrily repeating the talking points (reverse discrimination, etc.); that kind of behavior (anger, repetition) is not a sign of intelligent analysis and won&#x27;t likely help us solve these problems.",1418072456

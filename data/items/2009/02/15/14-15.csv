481999,comment,481880,481916,0,0,swombat,,,"Sure, and I never criticise the noble aim of trying to figure out ways to increase our chances of success (we need all the help we can get). However, I think you'll find a stronger correlation between ""being aware of a very pressing and important unmet need that people are willing to pay to resolve"" and success than between ""making a philosophical gamble on the future"" and success...",1234709853

481996,comment,481974,481974,0,0,swombat,,,"Slightly misleading headline from BBC there... it should really be ""Galaxy <i>may</i> have 'billions of Earths'"". There's no proof of it, it's just an estimate/guess. It may well be true, but there's no proof yet.<p>Billions of earth-like planets. Makes you want to live forever to get to explore all that stuff, doesn't it?",1234709750

481994,comment,480171,480507,0,0,petercooper,,,"You don't get much value out of Twitter if you just post for the sake of posting. It's like e-mail. If all you used it for was writing to a penpal, then there's limited value there. But.. most people have evolved beyond that.<p>My grandmother would never have seen the point of e-mail beyond sending ""letters"" to each other.. but we all know now it goes deeper than that.<p>People who don't see extended value in Twitter now are like my theoretical grandmother and her myopic view of e-mail.",1234709671
481993,comment,480171,480593,0,0,petercooper,,,"<i>Yes, it is.</i><p>But you don't <i>have</i> to deal with e-mail as a dribble, as you say. I deal with e-mail as a batch process, just several times a day instead of once every few months. Ditto for Twitter and the like.",1234709547

They carried a lot Microsoft-logo-covered scwhag -- the kind of stuff they give away at conferences -- mistakingly thinking that people would want to buy that stuff for their home.<p>One disadvantage, from a retail perspective, is that there's no way to make a a table full of computers from different vendors look beautiful. No matter what you do, it will end-up looking like a mishmash of mostly ugly plastic machines.<p>They should definitely follow in Apple's footsteps and give people free access to the Internet -- that will, at a minimum, fill the store with people and give the illusion that people are buying stuff. I think that worked to Apple's advantage.",1234708320

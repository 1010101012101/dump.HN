2876144,comment,2875211,2875950,2,0,Silhouette,,,"> It implies that whether we should allow totalitarian measures merely depends on a judgement of case by case merit<p>To some extent, all effective government is necessarily conducted based on case by case merit. Even what we think of as fundamental human rights can never truly be sacrosanct, for the simple reason that sometimes they conflict. One obvious recurring example in recent years has been the tension between security (right to life etc.) and secrecy (right to private life).<p>Should we protect some values more than others? Sure. Should some principles be considered too important for the administration of the day to legislate them away without going to the people explicitly first? Absolutely. Can you ever codify that in a reasonable way without allowing some degree of case-by-case judgement? I doubt it.<p>> So what if the authorities decide one day there is no good side?<p>Then you move onto the next of the four boxes of liberty. If lots of people agree with you, then one way or another, either the authorities will back down or they will be removed from power.<p>The more I think about these issues, the more I conclude that the law can only ever be an instrument of a civil society. If you reach the point where one significant group is not behaving in a civilised fashion and the rest cannot persuade them to do so through reason, then ultimately it rarely matters what the law says until that disagreement has been settled by force. On a small scale, that is called policing. On a large scale, it is called civil war.<p>If you accept that premise, then it only ever makes sense to balance the law favourably for the civil case, on the presumption that the legal system is operated in the interests of justice. If it is not in a few isolated cases, you treat the deviants as criminals themselves and you provide an appeals mechanism for those who have been treated unfairly. If it is not on a larger scale, then the law doesn't really matter anyway, because your only recourse is to bring down the system and build a new one. You can do that by voting out the government, through civil disobedience that puts unbearable pressure on the system, or on a more fundamental level as we've seen in several former dictatorships over the past year.",1313128138

I'm a fairly senior-level guy, and would happily trade a bigger salary for a large equity chunk at a startup, but we're talking a <i>large</i> chunk, bigger than a lot of companies are willing to give to non-founders.<p>Let's say that I usually make $160k/year, and I'm willing to work for half that at a startup for four years, which means that I'm giving up $320k in income.<p>I'm not going to do that for a <i>chance</i> at earning $320k, but I'll definitely do so for a 10% chance at earning $3.2M.\nWhich means that if the company exits four years later at $50MM, I'd need a 6.4% equity stake to make my target. If the company exits for any less than $5M, I've lost money.<p>Naturally, this is a simplified analysis of the situation, but it illustrates an important point. I know of a lot of startups that want to pay their employees peanuts, while at the same time giving them a tiny slice of the pie.<p>None of these companies have been massively successful either, in part due to the best talent having zero interest in committing to a company where they aren't valued.",1313127632

Of course mutual funds and the like do so on a very long term basis. In any case, they <i>pay</i> the spread. So if the spread is narrower then they make more money in average.<p>Example: if the Apple's quote is 95/105 (buy/sell) today and 105/115 tomorrow, an invidual trader buying and selling would just break even (buy at 105 and sell at 105) even though Apple's notional fair value has risen. But if there are more market makers, the quotes would be 99/101 and 109/111. Then our individual trader would make 109 - 99 = 10 in the same market conditions.<p>You're right that a wider spread wouldn't matter much to an individual trader, but that's mainly because their main cost is trading fees (paid to the broker) anyway. For mutual funds, though, a 1 basis-point change in the spread means <i>a lot</i> of money.",1313125971

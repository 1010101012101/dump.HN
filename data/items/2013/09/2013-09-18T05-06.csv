Usually with QFT you start with locality and unitarity as a sort of starting point. You might hope that you could come up with something much simpler where locality and unitarity come about naturally from the model itself (the goal of physics being to show that &quot;it had to be this way&quot;.) QFT tells us how the world works by calculating scattering amplitudes. You throw n things in, and m things come out with some momentum, some spin, some color, etc. The way we started doing this was with Feynman diagrams... these diagrams tend to look like you have some particles banging off of some other particles, and they behave a little that way, but they&#x27;re actually a notation for integrals in a series that you have to sum over. Hence the genius of the notation... they describe math while looking like something physically relevant. However, they&#x27;re a little weird in that if you interpreted the diagram literally, you&#x27;d find that some of the diagrams involved in an interaction actually aren&#x27;t physical! One might say that the degree of nonphysicality suppresses that diagram&#x27;s contribution. Physicists describe these diagrams as &quot;off-mass-shell.&quot; If you wish to describe an interaction, you figure out all the diagrams relevant to the interaction, calculate them and sum them. When the article says &quot;tons of pages of calculations&quot;, what they mean is you need to sum over a LOT of Feynman diagrams to get an answer.<p>Now, there&#x27;s some newish kinda diagram that&#x27;s gone into use (I think maybe only for N=4 SYM?), which is also used to calculate interaction cross-sections. However, they&#x27;re written in such a way that they always describe on-shell processes, hence why they&#x27;re called on-shell diagrams. I think Zvi Bern had something to do with this. These diagrams have an underlying structure... and mathematicians have started writing similar diagrams recently (as in, they ran into a similar structure recently), but instead of the diagrams being to describe interactions, they&#x27;re used to describe some structure called a positive grassmanian. The positive grassmanian in low dimensions relates to convex polygons... it&#x27;s a simple thing. This guy had this interesting insight that an interaction crossection corresponds to some sort of volume... and in this case, it corresponds to the volume of this polytope described by the positive grassmanian... or something like that.<p>The positive grassmanian says nothing at all about unitarity or positivity, nothing about space or time, but it lets you calculate shit. That&#x27;s very, very cool.",1379483412

Billions of people today do not have electricity and clean running water in their house.<p>I don&#x27;t have potable running water in my house (in Indonesia).  The water is clean enough I feel comfortable brushing my teeth in it and showering in it.  Not clean enough I can drink it without boiling it.  We don&#x27;t have central hot water (just some small units on the showers), only some rooms have air conditioning, etc.<p>On the other hand we have some other luxuries.  We have a bottled water dispenser in our home that dispenses near-boiling water for tea or coffee (with child safety devices no less).  We have two maids who keep the house clean and help with the children.<p>> I agree there are quality of life issues in the USA that are obscured by cash wealth.<p>I think the larger issues are this:<p>1.  Cash wealth != capital wealth.  The median US household is far more capital-poor than the median Indonesian family.  I would define capital wealth as accessible resources that can go into capital investments minus total debt.  It has little bearing on balance sheet wealth (and can be significantly above or below that).<p>2.  We an extraordinarily multi-layered approach to discouraging small business in the US.  This includes regulation aimed at large businesses which has, in some cases, made small business flat-out illegal (see the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act), complex tax codes which lead to large corporations paying less taxes than small businesses, a health insurance regulatory framework that chains people to corporate jobs (not new under Obamacare, but exacerbated by that), and the like.  Self-employment is the privilege of the wealthy in the US, and that undermines everyone.<p>When I was in the US, my AGI was in the 70k range (after deductions and the like) and it wasn&#x27;t always that easy to make ends meet with children.  Making $20k/year over here would be an improvement to be honest in terms of quality of life.  Two of my three kids were born over here without medical insurance, and the care set me back a lot less than the one who was born in the US with insurance (which nearly put me into bankruptcy--- I think I calculated our out of pocket expenses after insurance were over $10k).<p>> We often are comparing our &quot;shortfall&quot; to this tiny little stretch of time and location that was great and worrying that it isn&#x27;t fair it isn&#x27;t quite as great as that.<p>I don&#x27;t know.  I am more concerned that we tend to think of ourselves as uniquely well off, but....<p>1.  Homelessness is criminalized in the US (especially in Democratic-voting urban centers!) far more heavily than over here in Indonesia.<p>2.  Having a business is easier over here than in the US unless you are a foreigner (why my business entities are effectively owned by my wife so I can avoid the minimum investment limit).<p>3.  Care for the elderly is better because people care for their relatives more closely.  Also this means that people invest more heavily in their children&#x27;s education and businesses since children are retirement policies.<p>What we have done in the US is to substitute &quot;things&quot; for &quot;people&quot; among the poor and the picture isn&#x27;t pretty.  So often I hear how we don&#x27;t want the US to be &quot;a third-world nation&quot; but the fact is we have a lot to learn from less well off countries about how to live more socially and sustainably.",1379481664

But, this really isn&#x27;t one of them.<p>For instance, selling phones with features stripped from them (bootloader unlock capabilities on HTC One, for instance), is really not brilliant, and may well be a violation of the intent of the terms, if not the letter.  The same might be the case for stripping tethering services from devices.  (They certainly did get nailed once for asking Google to block a tethering app on their behalf; I think they caved before the FCC intervened.  Please feel free to correct me if I&#x27;m wrong; the details on that one are hazy in my head.)<p>But, there&#x27;s nothing that says they have to sell you service (or sell you a SIM card).  If you have one, you can attach it... but there&#x27;s nothing that says they have to give you one for that purpose.<p>The &quot;protection of the licensee&#x27;s network&quot; clause is a loophole big enough to drive a truck through, by the way.  They can set up as onerous of a certification process as they (reasonably) want, and indeed, they have in the past -- the intent of the regulation is just that they have to apply it fairly.  The reason why these rules are there are that cell networks are incredibly fragile, and very sensitive to antenna calibration; especially on CDMA networks, the near-far problem[1] can be pretty lethal to service for <i>everyone</i> on the tower if just <i>one</i> device is miscalibrated.  It wouldn&#x27;t at all surprise me if they had similar extensive calibration requirements for their LTE network, and they&#x27;d be well within their rights to do that sort of thing.<p>I&#x27;m as much of an unhappy Verizon customer as the next fellow, but whining that you can&#x27;t just go transmit on their frequencies with devices that they haven&#x27;t tested is not really conducive to the cause of folks who would say that Verizon&#x27;s upper C-block management is behaving in a fashion that limits customer freedom.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-far_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-far_problem</a>",1379480945

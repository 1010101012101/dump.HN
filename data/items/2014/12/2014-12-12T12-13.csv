8739742,comment,8738646,8738646,0,0,JumpCrisscross,,,"The silent yet steady substitution of unemployment benefits with federal disability insurance is well covered in an episode of <i>This American Life</i> [1]. We, as a country, have a shoddy system for re-training low-skills workers facing technological obsolescence. We have also set up a system under which unemployment benefits are largely a state liability.  Disability, on the other hand, is federally funded. The intersection of these trends, as documented by <i>This American Life</i>, lands us in the curious situation of state governments encouraging their unemployed to seek disability benefits (thereby shifting their burden onto the federal budget).<p>In the short run, state unemployment and federal disability benefits have similar effects. Social stability is enhanced through buying off the poor. But long-term disability is not designed for the under-trained. Its means-testing paradigm discourages even the exploration of employment options which might jeopardise the applicant&#x27;s disability status. Thus a one-way valve to dependency on the state&#x27;s largesse.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/490/trends-with-benefits"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/490/t...</a>",1418389142

8739740,comment,8735719,8736056,0,0,Matthias247,,,"Disclaimer: I&#x27;m also working in the industry.<p>My thoughts are that Adobe Actionscript (in conjuction with AIR) isn&#x27;t that bad. It could do years ago everything that is now reinvented with HTML5 and MVC frameworks (like angular), has a decent performance (if the port of the AIR runtime to your plattform was well done) and the the language is halfway sane (at least better then Javascript). I also liked it better then the new trend towards QT, because you can do everything in a single language.<p>I actually know some high end cars with some decent user-interfaces that are also using Adobe technology.<p>However you can do crappy UIs and a crappy implementation in every technology. If JD power gave bad ratings it&#x27;s most likely more due to a bad UI design and usability than due to the underlying technology.<p>I actually had expected that Ford uses Silverlight Embedded, as this was pushed by Microsoft at that time.

If I make a telephone order from a U.S. shop, they don&#x27;t have to comply with European law; I came to them.<p>The traditional law on this isn&#x27;t quite that clear in the 2nd case. If you take telephone or mail orders and ship to other countries, you do run a significant risk of exposing yourself to the laws of the destination country. If you have no presence in the destination it may be harder to enforce any ruling against you, though, so countries traditionally did much of the enforcement via screening shipments at customs. If you were selling mail-order goods without complying with destination law (e.g. selling appliances legal in the source country but not meeting safety-testing standards of the destination country), the law would be enforced by simply confiscating your shipments. Once it&#x27;s in, it&#x27;s harder to enforce laws, but in principle you can still be hauled into court in the destination country for e.g. a product-liability lawsuit.",1418387947

The physical location is irrelevant. It&#x27;s the policies and laws under which the companies must deal that&#x27;s more important. Of course enforcing certain laws in certain countries is impossible if the company doesn&#x27;t have a presence in that country. In that case, it&#x27;s up to the user to decide if they agree to whatever terms of service are offered within the country I which those terms are enforceable through the contract law process. Ultimately if a Google user doesn&#x27;t like the US law or terms of service offered, it&#x27;s up to the customer to go to another service. It&#x27;s unrealistic, not to mention crazy to force an Internet company to follow 170+ different country&#x27;s laws when those laws are often contradictory. Instead, it might be good for an Internet company to have a statement that outlines what jurisdiction under which they reside in terms of enforcing terms of service agreements. Most have this contract language already, but to make it clear to the user would allow them to make informed choices about the services they use.<p>The alternative if to wall off the internet by physical geography. So Google.com wouldn&#x27;t work in France, only Google.fr. That regionalization of the Internet is a horrible idea. You end up with Google.cn if you do that. If you use an American service, it&#x27;s expected that it follows American law. You, the user, are entering their place of business (virtual or not,) therefore their jurisdiction is the jurisdiction of record. If I travel to the U.S. and buy something at a store, EU consumer protections don&#x27;t apply, nor should they. If I make a telephone order from a U.S. shop, they don&#x27;t have to comply with European law; I came to them. That extrapolates to the virtual world as well. However, if a company does have a physical presence in a country, then obviously they are compelled to comply with local law. However that could be argued when it comes to online services -- just because WalMart has distribution centers in China doesn&#x27;t mean that the WalMart in Nebraska has to follow Chinese law.<p>Really I would argue for full and transparent disclosures AND I would support an Internet Privacy Treaty that provides reciprocity or equal protection between two countries. So a French Google user has the protections they expect but an American DailyMotion user has the protections they expect and claims could be mediated in either country. I am not a lawyer, nor a huge expert, but I do have some experience with my iCouch company (online therapy.) We have customers from the Middle East who see therapists based in the US, and it&#x27;s explicit that the customer&#x27;s interaction will be governed by the locale in which the therapist is located/licensed. It would be a virtual impossibility to have to conform with every country&#x27;s laws.. We can&#x27;t realistically stop visitors from certain places; should we be liable? Of course not. The visitor is the one that makes the choice to visit us or not. I am not as articulate about this as I would like, however one can see the maze that this starts to reveal. It&#x27;s not a simple question of &quot;where is the data stored.&quot;",1418386278

8739610,comment,8738686,8739519,0,0,nullc,,,"The paper has basically three parts.<p>(1) Shows attacks on ECDSA where there is a one bit of bias on the nonce. These should work equally well on Schnorr signatures of their various forms, including EdDSA (though EdDSA proscribes a particular nonce generation scheme which should hopefully not result in observable biases, other standards proscribe similar schemes for ECDSA users, e.g. RFC6967). If it turns out that the hash functions used for deterministic dsa in these systems are biased, this attack crops back up.<p>(It&#x27;s not news that biased RNGs can result in these attacks; the interesting part is that they were able to actually perform an attack on a non-toy curve, with only a one bit bias. Past attacks were mostly theory, and also needed more bias.)<p>(2) Some unusual curves can have an optimization which common implementations might take which results in biased nonces. These curves are not widely used on the Internet. I&#x27;m doubtful you&#x27;ve ever heard of them (except Bitcoin&#x27;s curve, which is a GLV curve, but I&#x27;m relatively confident _no one_ is using the endomorphism in signing). They also give advice on avoiding that weakness.<p>(3) One way of avoiding the weakness while still using the optimization is to decompose a uniform number instead of using two random numbers, they show an argument for a power attack against a candidate constant time decomposition algorithm. Again, moot if you&#x27;re not using the optimization.",1418386027

It&#x27;s just not designed for that.<p>There are plenty of large graphics/3D/video render farms, and they don&#x27;t use expensive workstations like the Mac Pro.

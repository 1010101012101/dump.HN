7738765,comment,7738194,7738676,100,0,jlongster,,,"Thanks for the rational response, Tom. I hope this doesn&#x27;t get buried (someone is going through and downvoting at least all of my comment to 0).<p>Blog posts are best when they are sensational, and I try not to overdue it. I think React has a lot of good ideas, but &quot;revolutionary&quot; is a strong word. I think &quot;refreshing&quot; is a better word. Regardless, I think both React and Ember are the best 2 solutions out there right now, with quite different philosophies, and I&#x27;m happy that users have a choice.<p>Using rAF in my post was pretty much a hack. I think it was fun to take that and run with it. When you use React though, you don&#x27;t actually do that, you use its `setState` method, or you use something like Cortex. If you look at my cortex example, you do use setters and getters, which give you a way to notify data change. Why don&#x27;t we just use models like Ember? Because React still doesn&#x27;t care how we model our data -- even if we have to call `set()` to trigger a paint update, what we get is the choice to use something like persistent data structures for our models.<p>=== I was completely wrong about Om, it does not continuously trigger rerendering/diffing ever 16ms with rAF. It only uses rAF to batch rendering, so multiple repaints are throttled to a minimum of 16ms ===<p>The on-screen issue is interesting; I need to think about it more to see if we can actually leverage it in production apps. I think we can for large list views. You don&#x27;t share scroll state, do you? I absolutely agree that too many JS apps are breaking the web, and I love that Ember has defaults to make that not happen. There is a grave danger in using React and not taking care to do things right.<p>I&#x27;m actually really, really happy about the idea of React and Ember being the 2 ways to choose to build webapps. I have the upmost respect and love for Ember, I think it does a lot of things right, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if things like routing wasn&#x27;t copied for libraries to use for React. <3",1399996457

JTRIG was a super-important reveal which was not covered whatsoever by the MSM, and is described as &quot;The scope of the JTRIG&#x27;s mission includes using &quot;dirty tricks&quot; to “destroy, deny, degrade [and] disrupt” enemies by “discrediting” them, planting misinformation and shutting down their communications.&quot; by Wikipedia.<p>In summary: NYT is wrong when they attempt to defend themselves against Greenwald&#x27;s claim that they&#x27;re pro-establishment because they refused to write stories on the most damaging Snowden files.<p>EDIT: Out of curiosity, I additionally decided to investigate whether the NYT and MSM covered Operation Earnest Voice, the NSA&#x27;s program to sway public opinion via shilling and sockpuppeting.<p>They did not cover the story whatsoever.

Now you want to discuss the underlying statistics used to generate a report like that.<p>Based on the page you pointed to, it&#x27;s hard to draw any specific conclusions. It suggests that the increase in crime is because of the change in Swedish policy since 1975 towards more diversity.<p>However, it could be because Sweden changed policies to report more crimes, or people have decided to report more crimes. As a well-known example, the number of reported rapes in Sweden is very high. BRÅ attributes it to using a different reporting scheme and a broader definition of rape than the other countries. Eg, (and if I understand the details correctly) if a woman says that she&#x27;s been raped by her husband every other night for the last year, then the Swedish policy is to report that as 180 reports of rapes, while other countries might regard it as a single report, or something that&#x27;s not reportable at all.<p>Or for another observation about policy changes, since the 1970s there has also been an increasing move towards privatization of the Swedish economy, and an increase in the Gini coefficient. With the statistics presented, it&#x27;s equally possible to argue that the movement away from traditional social democracy has contributed to increased levels of crime.<p>Or for still another observation, the number of crimes has gone up while the number of Saabs sold has gone down. Perhaps it&#x27;s all those drivers with old Saabs committing crimes in order to get spare parts for their beloved vehicles. That&#x27;s extremely unlikely, but that the type of conclusions one gets when only looking for statistical correlations.<p>These complexities in statical analysis are very well-known. Any analysis which doesn&#x27;t even bring up the issues in the introductory article must be treated with deep suspicion. An article like this one, which appears to have cherry-picked 15 year old report without giving the context to understand it, is almost certainly not a trustworthy source of information.",1399995913

Without React, the framework does a bunch of things and finally craps out objects that are transformed to HTML by the view (where the views are as &#x27;dumb&#x27; as possible). <i>With</i> React, instead of rendering the object to HTML, you just pass these objects, as JSON, to a React component (which could be the whole page), and it figures out what needs updating. You don&#x27;t have to deal (as much) with client-side logic if you don&#x27;t want to, and things will still be performant.<p>This also significantly simplifies server-side rendering, to the point where it might require only one extra call to render the component server side (the handy renderComponentToString).<p>Of course, in practice it&#x27;s often not quite that simple, but because of how React operates, you can get pretty far with relying primarily on the server-side framework and little logic on the React-side of things (plus you can achieve the &#x27;holy grail&#x27; of seamless server- and client-side rendering.<p>(apologies if I&#x27;m getting things wrong, by the way.

Take everything I say with a grain of salt as one of the authors of Ember.js.<p>First, as described here and as actually implemented by Om, this eliminates complexity by spamming the component with state change notifications via requestAnimationFrame (rAF). That may be a fair tradeoff in the end, but I would be nervous about building a large-scale app that relied on diffing performance for every data-bound element fitting in rAF&#x27;s 16ms window.<p>(I&#x27;ll also mention that this puts a pretty firm cap on how you can use data binding in your app, and it tends to mean that people just use binding from the JavaScript -> DOM layer. One of the nicest things about Ember, IMO, is that you can model your entire application, from the model layer all the way up to the templates, with an FRP-like data flow.)<p>My second concern is that components libraries really don&#x27;t do anything to help you manage which components are on screen, and in a way that doesn&#x27;t break the URL. So many JavaScript apps feel broken because you can&#x27;t share them, you can&#x27;t hit the back button, you can&#x27;t hit refresh and not lose state, etc. People think MVC is an application architecture, but in fact MVC is a component architecture— your app is composed of many MVCs, all interacting with each other. Without an abstraction to help you manage that (whether it&#x27;s something like Ember or something you&#x27;ve rolled yourself), it&#x27;s easy for the complexity of managing which components are on screen and what models they&#x27;re plugged into to spin quickly out of control. I have yet to see the source code for any app that scales this approach out beyond simple demos, which I hope changes because I would love to see how the rubber hits the pavement.<p>It&#x27;s always interesting to see different approaches to this problem. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as revolutionary as many people want to make it out to be, but I&#x27;ve never been opposed to borrowing good ideas liberally, either. Thanks again, James!",1399995591

Or you can become a master software developer and build something of quality without needing a crutch like a framework.<p>Now, if the needs of the project are such that a framework will suffice then by all means, use a framework.  Chances are, if you&#x27;re doing more than building a working prototype then at some point a framework is <i>going</i> to fail you.  If you enjoy building apps using frameworks then by all means, do it.  But to my mind you&#x27;re doing your customer a disservice.<p>Contrast that with great software developers (and I&#x27;ve been fortunate to have worked with some <i>really</i> great developers) who abhor these frameworks.  They can get more done with less code and ultimately deliver the project faster without frameworks.  The tradeoff is that it takes time and dedication to achieve that level of mastery.  I personally would prefer that path.",1399995579

7738669,comment,7738194,7738512,5,0,jeswin,,,"Yup that is what it is. It builds on the notion that many apps are actually forums, with various levels of customization. Flickr, Pinterest, HN and even Amazon and Tiger Direct (TigerDirect will have products, reviews etc as &#x27;posts&#x27;) are actually forums. So we use the term forums and apps interchangeably.<p>The social aspect is equally important:<p>- There are millions of developers who don&#x27;t participate in improving apps today because creating and hosting an app isn&#x27;t a friction-less process. On Fora, if you see an app/forum that fits your needs, click fork, edit some JS+React/JSX in the browser, and you have a new app.<p>- Everybody sees all source code for all apps/forums; so it&#x27;s great to learn. And then improvements help everybody. Like wikipedia for code. .<p>- Many people know enough JS to tweak stuff. React mostly takes just JS knowledge, so you don&#x27;t need to know the framework like Angular. Ah, and also isomorphic UI code that runs on the server and browser. Also for all it&#x27;s issues, one thing JS has going for it is that you can read and edit in a browser.<p>Ah there; I got excited. :)",1399995560

Why optimize when you can just throw CPU cycles or memory at the problem?

There&#x27;s another framework I&#x27;ve used that was also intuitive for beginners: Backbone. The reason why Backbone is inferior to Angular and Ember is because it optimized for the beginner. Angular and Ember are optimized for the experienced developer on a large code base.<p>Specific to your suggestion, which I think is awesome, is the idea of composibility. The easiest kind of component to write is a large component with lots of options, like jQuery plugins. This is the hardest kind of component to use <i>outside of its intended use case</i>.<p>What makes Angular so good is that the core directives are all extremely composable. They can be used all over the place without hacking.<p>To make your dream come true we as component authors must design carefully to make smaller, more focused tools, rather than large components, because large components are harder to adapt to applications outside their main use case.",1399994891

A point is scored under them for each surrounded intersection plus each stone on the board. So you can defend any supposed weakness without losing points (you still lose sente and points if you needlessly defend when the score is not settled yet). You can even reduce your territories to two eyes each if you feel like.<p>By the way, the Chinese rules let solve neatly all those cases handled by special rules in the Japanese rules. The bent four in the corner is the most notable one. Playing it out with the Chinese rules is a neat explanation why that corner is defined to be dead: the surrounding player defends any weakness without losing points and starts the ko. The other player has no ko threats and dies. Those defensive moves lose points under the Japanese rules so they have to make a special rule for that shape and many others.<p>The only problem with the Chinese rules is that scoring takes longer and completely destroy the shape of the game: you fill in the territory of one player, take out the other&#x27;s stones and count by grouping the stones in convenient shapes. Furthermore if you want to count during play you must remember how many stones have been captured because prisoners are returned to their bowl and are not stored in plain view (the score penalty is paid by not having those stoned on the board). Japanese rules are a shortcut that makes scoring easy but the tradeoff is the dictionary of special cases at the end of the game.",1399994131

The source of bloodshed in Somalia is foreign governments via the UN/AMISOM and their largely Kenyan/Ethiopian troops trying to prop up a government in Mogadishu, as well as the foreign-funded al-Shabaab they fight. This is not some noble jihad for democracy, just various factions struggling for the benefits a monopoly backed by strong foreign powers will bring.<p>The political climate and level of violence in south and southwest Somalia is vastly different than the rest of the region. Beyond Galkayo, there is pretty much no war. In Puntland and Somaliland, Xeer and customary law trumps the weak governments of the autonomous regions.<p>You falsely equate Xeer to the mafia and where the Xeer legal order reigns there is peace in Somalia. A mafia system is identical to a state except a state has public acceptance of the hegemony. The Somali people want Xeer and not state rule. Even during the Barre regime they would not recognize decisions of state courts and would handle the bulk of disputes their own way and ignore state rulings.<p>The decades of bloodshed come from a minority group of western-educated democracy lovers and psychopath &quot;warlords&quot; who have been waging war on the Mogadishu area for the prize of UN recognition and the trough of foreign aid money it brings.",1399994124

7738511,comment,7738194,7738386,4,0,rjknight,,,"React has a much richer notion of what a &#x27;component&#x27; is.  To date, most JavaScript libraries lack shared assumptions about how you will build your UI.  jQuery plugins make only the extremely minimal assumption that you will apply the plugin to some DOM element - beyond that, how the plugins behave, how they manage their state, properties etc. is not defined by any standards or even assumptions.<p>The confirmation popover you link to is a good example.  It&#x27;s a black-box component which exposes a fairly minimal interface.  The constructor for this component works like this:<p><pre><code>  new ConfirmationPopover(msg, [title])\n</code></pre>\nTo attach the popover to an element you need to do:<p><pre><code>  popover.show(el, [fn])\n</code></pre>\nHowever, if we take another component from the same library, the swipe component[1], we see different conventions.  Its constructor:<p><pre><code>  Swipe(el)\n</code></pre>\nIt also has a show method which takes totally different parameters:<p><pre><code>  .show(i, [ms], [options])\n</code></pre>\nThis is why I describe such systems as package managers or library managers - they&#x27;re just a way of importing and exporting code and don&#x27;t do anything to aid reuse.  They&#x27;re not particularly likely to play well together, lack standard interfaces and are almost certainly not composable in any meaningful way.<p>React components are different because React defines some standard details of how components behave, how to extend them, how to inspect them and pass data back and forth.  Components can contain other components, and all components have a relative place in the render tree.  This makes possible standard developer tools that can be used to observe and inspect components in a DOM-like tree structure[2].<p>So, you could certainly use bower to <i>distribute</i> React components.  What&#x27;s different about React isn&#x27;t how the code is distributed but the fact that you can have expectations about how, say, a React photo gallery component would behave that you would <i>not</i> get from some other JS library.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/component/swipe"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/component/swipe</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/01/02/react-chrome-developer-tools.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/01/02/react-chrome...</a>",1399994076

Notice that in order to cut off branches of the search space as soon as possible, I introduce the tests for the constraints as soon as possible while generating the permutations.  This is standard Python and only needs one function (permutations) from the standard library.",1399993572

This is because, normally, writing code for such software is within the skill of the art, not requiring undue experimentation, once its functions have been disclosed. * * * Thus, flow charts or source code listings are not a requirement for adequately disclosing the functions of software.” [0]<p>But that&#x27;s the state of patent practice in most subject areas now.

Think github not for source code, but live apps[1].<p>One of the key requirements for this was a way to run untrusted scripts client-side (server-side is somewhat easy), since the platform lets users write arbitrary UI components.

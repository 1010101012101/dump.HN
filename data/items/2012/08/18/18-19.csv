4401931,comment,4401576,4401576,32,0,justincormack,,,"The opposition into Japan is not about the exact number of cancers or deaths. It is about trust. To quote the official report [1]:<p>...the subsequent accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant cannot be regarded as a natural disaster. It was a profoundly manmade disaster  that could and should have been foreseen and prevented. And its effects could have been mitigated by a more effective human response.<p>How could such an accident occur in Japan, a nation that takes such great pride in its global reputation for excellence in engineering and technology? This Commission believes the Japanese people  and the global community  deserve a full, honest and transparent answer to this question.<p>Our report catalogues a multitude of errors and willful negligence that left the Fukushima plant unprepared for the events of March 11. And it examines serious deficiencies in the response to the accident by TEPCO, regulators and the government.<p>For all the extensive detail it provides, what this report cannot fully convey  especially to a global audience  is the mindset that supported the negligence behind this disaster. What must be admitted  very painfully  is that this was a disaster Made in Japan.<p>Its fundamental causes are to be found in the ingrained conventions of Japanese culture: our reflexive obedience; our reluctance to question authority; our devotion to sticking with the program; our groupism; and our insularity.<p>(the rest is worth reading too)<p>If your government and industry had failed you like that would you trust them to continue with nuclear power without fixing the underlying problems?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nirs.org/fukushima/naiic_report.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nirs.org/fukushima/naiic_report.pdf</a>",1345316252

4401906,comment,4401315,4401746,1,0,Cushman,,,"I don't really buy this idea that it's not ""really"" a camera.<p>Think of it like this: A still camera has a number of small receptors. When you take a photograph, you wind up with a bunch of numbers that average the amount of light that hit each one. It's not a perfect record of the light that was really there-- does that count as a ""real"" picture? A video camera takes a series of slices at particular moments in time. Information about events that occur between those slices is lost, either blurred out of existence or ignored entirely. Does that count as ""real"" video?<p>So, this camera can record a single line once at a precise instant in time. If we want to turn that into a moving picture, we can either parallelize the camera, or serialize the event. So let's say we put together a hundred million of these cameras using mirrors and amplifiers and whatever else we need to record video of a single pulse of light happening once. Let's say we also use a single camera to record video of a hundred million pulses of light which we know will have a variance of less than the resolution of the camera. Let's say we crunch the data from both of these ""cameras"", and they come out as identical.<p>Which one is the ""real"" video?<p>Anyway, there's a much more salient reason why this wouldn't work for a moving object: As the man pointed out, at this rate, even a speeding bullet would not move perceptibly.",1345315785

Yes, buffering will help a lot, but buffering doesn't conjure up capacity that doesn't exist.

Chrome/Firefox/Opera on Android all seem like better mobile browsers to me.<p>I think Safari still doesn't auto-highlight the text in the search box (my most used browser function besides actually scrolling a page), so annoying to start typing a new search time and realize it's just adding on to the last search time until I hit the x. I guess Safari now at least syncs tabs and bookmarks with the desktop version, but still it's a stretch to say it even competes as a top mobile browser IMO.<p>I think notifications are only annoying on older iOS versions. In Android they've always been unobtrusive, and with Android 3.0+ (and especially in 4.1) they've got a lot of added useful functionality.<p>But to get back to the point I would say the defining feature on iOS is proper group texting.

Its like a slightly fancier version of the how to make money online courses.<p>They also seem to look down on selling their products directly to users (we dont want to nickel and dime our users).

But, the approach to building such products would be to go deep on a specific problem in a small market and expand only when youve nailed that business.

An instruction may require 6 clock cycles (latency) to complete but if you can issue 3 instructions per cycle then the throughput is 2 clock cycles per operation.<p>The Intel i7 has 6 operation execution ports per core, 3 of which can be used for basic integer operations. Shifts execute in a single clock cycle, but since there are 3 ALUs it is possible to execute 3 shifts per clock cycle.<p>There are a class of low-latency algorithm optimizations based on making sure that all operation ports are being used nearly every clock cycle. It is a special type of fixed, low-level parallelism that most software does not do very well by default. I've seen intentional and careful ALU saturation generate 2x performance gains for algorithms.

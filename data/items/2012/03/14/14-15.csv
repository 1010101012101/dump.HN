Who are the CEO's customers, the market the company is targeting, or the company's employees? I'd argue both, the CEO is the visionary and cheerleader for the staff, and also the public image for the customers. If you come out and say we are not sustainable, guess how many employees you'll have at the end of the week? Guess how many customers? After putting 100's or 1000's of hours into something, you'd be hard pressed to find anyone willing to go that route",1331737068

Within a few more weeks, I turned off the test suite.<p>I wrote the product, got it working, received market feedback, realized my model was all wrong, rewrote the entire domain model and UI multiple times all to finally realize that my component boundaries were all wrong and intuitively understanding where they should've been.<p>Now I feel confident about an architecture that will stay stable for 12+ months and each new component I write is properly tested.<p>In the meanwhile my lack of tests is starting to bite me very slowly, but I find that I'm just slowly replacing all 'bad parts' with properly tested components with clearly defined boundaries, rather than changing existing code.<p>And in the end I'm really happy that I decided not to test as much.

It appears it partly relies on information asymmetry, i.e. ripping off clients without them knowing. This business model seems to have been damaged by this bad PR that aims to dissolve illusions of the clients. I hope this kids gets his bonus, but probably Goldman will just fire him after such a move. This is what happens when there are too many greedy hands wanting the honeypot, but one isn't satisfied. Not that unique to Goldman to be honest. When your business model relies on information asymmetry, whistle blowers can be a real pain.

Presentation of text content can affect reading speed and retention. Presentation of graphical data can highlight useful patterns or it can obscure and mislead. In some cases, a minor adjustment to the content itself will give better results than changing the whole presentation: consider the editor who recommends slightly rewording an article rather than accepting a semantically awkward line break.<p>You can choose not to specify anything about your presentation, but that doesn't mean it's not there, only that you're going to get some default behaviour, which may or may not be any good for your content.<p>This <i>does</i> pose a genuine issue for those with disabilities, who may use assistive technologies to access the same content but not necessarily with the same visual styling. This is one good reason for marking up Web content using semantic HTML, and then applying visual styling as an extra layer of presentation on top: alternative tools, such as screen readers, can present the same information in different ways for audiences with differing needs.<p>As far as fixed-width pages being evil/stupid, I think as an industry we've grown beyond treating page layout as a dichotomy where it's either ""fixed width"" or ""fluid layout"". With the myriad devices used to access Web content today, neither a completely fixed-width layout nor a classical fluid layout with widths given using relative units or percentages is likely to be much good for all likely screen types. Thus we see the emerging field of responsive design, where content-rich sites specify multiple layouts (any of which might contain fixed and/or fluid elements) and choose between them based on screen resolution, device orientation, physical screen size/pixel density, and so on. We've even been seeing interesting research into responsive content recently, where more than just the layout adapts to give a better experience particularly to users of mobile devices with small screens and different browsing habits, though personally I think the jury is still out on that one. In any case, hopefully we are well past the days of either specifying a wide fixed width that doesn't work very well for smaller devices (or those who just prefer to browse in a relatively narrow window) or specifying no width at all and allowing text content to get far too wide to read comfortably on large screens.",1331735998

3703207,comment,3702892,3703119,8,0,vivekprakash,,,"""Ten years ago, most computer users were young people or professionals with lots of technical expertise. When things went wrong – which they often did – they knew how to fix things. Nowadays, the average user is far less sophisticated, perhaps a 12-year-old girl or a grandfather. Most of them know about as much about fixing computer problems as the average computer nerd knows about repairing his\ncar. What they want more than anything else is a computer that works all the time, with no glitches and no failures. Many users automatically compare their computer to their television set. Both are full of magical electronics and have big screens. Most users have an implicit model of a television set: (1) you buy the set; (2) you plug it in; (3) it works perfectly without any failures of any kind for the next 10 years. They expect that from the computer, and when they do not get it, they get frustrated. When computer experts tell them: ""If God had wanted computers to work all the time, He wouldn't have invented ‘Reset’ buttons"" they are not impressed.<p>For lack of a better definition of dependability, let us adopt this one: A device is said to be dependable if 99% of the users never experience any failures during the entire period they own the device. By this definition, virtually no computers are dependable, whereas most TVs, iPods, digital cameras, camcorders, etc. are. Techies are willing to forgive a computer that crashes once or twice a year; ordinary users are not. Home users aren't the only ones annoyed by the poor dependability of computers. Even in highly technical settings, the low dependability of computers is a problem. Companies like Google and Amazon, with hundreds of thousands of servers, experience many failures every day. They have learned to live with this, but they would really prefer systems that just worked all the time. Unfortunately, current software fails them.<p>The basic problem is that software contains bugs, and the more software there is, the more bugs there are. Various studies have shown that the number of bugs per thousand lines of code (KLoC) varies from 1 to 10 in large production systems. A really well-written piece of software might have 2 bugs per KLoC over time, but not fewer. An operating system with, say, 4 million lines of code is thus likely to have at least 8000 bugs. Not all are fatal, but some will be. A study at Stanford University showed that device drivers – which make up\n70% of the code base of a typical operating system – have bug rates 3x to 7x higher than the rest of the system. Device drivers have higher bug rates because (1) they are more complicated and (2) they are inspected less. While many people study the scheduler, few look at printer drivers.<p>The Solution: Smaller Kernels<p>The solution to this problem is to move code out of the kernel, where it can do maximal damage, and put it into user-space processes, where bugs cannot cause system crashes. This is how Minix 3 is designed.""<p>From <a href=""http://www.linux-magazine.com/Issues/2009/99/Minix-3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linux-magazine.com/Issues/2009/99/Minix-3</a>",1331733808

First mover advantage has also been shown not to be very important - just look at Facebook vs earlier social networks as an extreme example. Its all about execution - anyone can come up with good ideas (hell, YC is now even experimenting with accepting teams <i>without</i> ideas). Besides, lots of people have ideas all the time and very few people go through with them. The going through with them is the valuable part, not the having ideas part.<p>[1] I was at Startup Weekend recently and our team (5 of us who had never met before the Friday night) turned a vague and impossible concept into a workable product prototype including business plan, market validation and pitch to investors in ~40 hours. We started out because we felt it would be a fun project to build crazy multiplayer game AI and ended up with an analytics solution that real game developers told us they would happily pay for to being approached by an investor asking us to continue working on it - all in the space of a weekend of focused brainstorming. If a focused weekend is all it takes to come up with a refined idea, basic prototype, business plan, market validation and pitch to investors, then I don't think its worth worrying about if someone will steal your idea. Most startups fail anyway and I bet very very few, if any at all, failures are because the company didn't keep quiet about their idea.<p>PS: the one time when it may make sense to keep your ideas secret is if you are told to, eg, by an investor who's about to give you a lot of money (but be careful! don't want the investor to back out after you've told everyone else that you can't talk about your business...).

I would only engage people that I felt's portfolio reflected the qualities that I was looking for. If they don't have a portfolio then sure, they have to build something anyway just to prove that they can build something but that is a limited subset most that would be applying will have previous work that can be submitted.<p>As well I don't see how a few hours could provide anything beyond a very amateur quality mock-up. Sure a few hours and some jQuery UI elements could make something pretty, but I am assuming that you are looking for a little more depth than someone that can just throw some jQuery UI widgets on a page.<p>For me, I would be looking for someone that has deep dynamic language understanding, a deep understanding of event based programming and how events can be used to decouple UI elements and how that can create elements that can be dropped into a UI framework and auto wire itself up to data events. Someone that understands promises and it's relationship to asynchronous callback based programming constructs. I personally would be embarrassed to submit something that only had a few hours effort in it, because it most assuredly not going to cover all of those core aspects and the ones that are covered are not going to be fleshed out in a detailed level that one should be using to exemplify the state of their skill.<p>I wish you luck (i mean that with all sincerity), and I do hope the people that chose to engage in your interview do truly enjoy it. For me, it crosses to many personal boundaries to be comfortable with employing such recruiting tactics.<p>I would like to ask that you come back and give us a postmortem on how the exercise went and ask that any HN'rs that participate contribute to that conversation.

2209426,comment,2209315,2209315,0,0,chamakits,,,"Well, the thing is (my own opinion though, so I could be wrong) Nokia has invested in the past a lot of their time and money on their developers and on creating a great platform for them.  The had the Symbian OS which was very popular as far as smart phones go, and they had more recently acquired QT, which played nicely with the Symbian OS.<p>Now, it's worthy to note, that the smartphone market today and the one before are quite different.  Smartphones were way more expensive, and development for them wasn't quite as easy.  However, those that invested in having one, and in developing for them found a great deep appreciation for their phones.  These smartphones had no restrictions whatever.  You bought it, you own it.  If you can compile something that runs on it, go ahead!  This is something that fans of the Symbian OS praised, and followed them religiously because of it.  So, although Nokia's platform took a lot longer to spread in fame than say iOS, they had existed for so long that they had built quite a large following of dedicated and loyal users/developers.  So loyal that even though their smartphones are quite a bit more expensive than the competitors, they still believe (and probably rightfully so) that the investment is worth it.<p>How did Nokia achieve all this?  Again, they invested a lot of money and resources on it.  Nokia is a huge company.  As a result, they are a huge part of the Finnish economy as well.  Their  business is based around these investments and the large user base that they have built because of them.  Not only that, but they were also in collaboration with other companies in building MeeGo.  MeeGo was meant to be a Linux based OS that would bring the gap between PC and cellphones even closer, since it was meant more as a Linux distro (like say Redhat, Ubuntu or Suse) rather than a derivate of Linux (like Android and OpenMoko).<p>Now, taking all of this into account, they announce that they will be focusing on Windows phones.  Their huge user based is feeling betrayed because essentially all the hard work they may have put into the Symbian ecosystem (which I haven't personally experienced, but have heard it has quite a learning curve) will go to waste, the MeeGo platform may not come to full fruition because of conflict of interests, and surely a lot of layoffs are bound to happen since it seems they are going to let the majority of their software division die out.  Not only that, but they had always been pro open source and open platforms, and they are now announcing the will probably go with the company that many see as a rival to these ideals.  Is the user base biased against Microsoft?  Probably, but that isn't it either.  I'm almost certain had they announced that they were going with Android, there still would have been a major backlash.  Maybe less so of one because Android is an open platform, perhaps facilitating porting efforts and the move to another OS, but I'm almost certain there still would be a lot of people in uproar.<p>In conclusion, I think the problem here isn't that Nokia is investing in Microsoft.  Thats not it at all.  Its that its not investing in itself and its loyal user base.  Thats what seems to be the problem....at least from what I can interpret.",1297490008

2209414,comment,2209064,2209318,0,0,jsz0,,,"Android may be open source but realistically how far can anyone diverge while maintaing compatibility, consistency, and the ability to push updates out in a timely fashion? At least with Microsoft they are entering a formal agreement. All these details have probably been worked out. Microsoft may have offered to let Nokia into the inner-circle of WM development. They may have agreed to have MS developers work very closely with Nokia for customizations. Hard to say without knowing all the details but it's doubtful Google would have agreed to the same terms since they simply don't need Nokia.<p>It reminds me of this story about K-9 developers wanting to re-integrate some of their enhancements back into ASOP and Google's response was basically 'nahhh' or Google giving Motorola sweetheart access to Honeycomb while leaving other tablet makers moaning & groaning on the CES floor. Those types of things probably contributed to Nokia's choice. Nokia wants to be actively involved in OS development. Their own efforts failed. Nokia being a somewhat old fashion sort of company was probably not comfortable with the uncertainty behind Google's rather blackbox-ish control of Android. In an ironic way Microsoft was actually offering more flexibility and openness of development plus all the perks of free marketing dollars, joint promotions, and generally being treated like a first class citizen with a contract to define the exact terms of the relationship.",1297489412

2209387,comment,2205975,2207318,0,0,wlesieutre,,,"But without controlling their software, Nokia's almost entirely surrendered control over their product direction to Microsoft. Contrast it to Apple, where having their own hardware and software lets them do things like the retina display upgrade. In Nokia's case, MS says ""This is what the OS is capable of,"" and Nokia has no choice other than ""Ok, we'll make a touchscreen with some buttons that comply with your interface conventions.""<p>They're going from a mobile phone company to a widget manufacturer. It's a position not very different from where Dell, Gateway, HP, etc have been in control of product design, but unable to innovate in ways that would really improve the customer experience. So they're relegated to hardware design (within some pretty narrow constraints) and differentiating their computers by loading some shitty bloatware on and saying ""<competitor> doesn't have a dock on all four screen edges like we do!""<p>There's still money to be made in the hardware business, but it's not something I'd aspire to were I in the cellular industry. It's better than being put out of business, but Microsoft's lack of direction in OS design is likely to hobble them as they try to compete with Apple's ecosystem. I mean, WM7 tried to copy iOS 1 and say ""Nah, you don't need copy/paste"". Apple's continued to make progress toward a capable mobile OS, and MS still hasn't fixed it. Do you see them having a good chance at competing in the long run?<p>My prediction: Nokia and WM7 won't be able to compete on features or design, so they'll compete on price. As the smartphone market portion continues to grow, a lot of it will be on the bottom end, with people moving from crappy featurephones to crappy smartphones. If they can find a market niche, it'll be the people who just say ""I want a phone,"" and not anybody who knows or cares any more than that.

Sufficient to say a white paper could be written on that subject alone.<p>Anyway, progressive enhancement kills all of the advantages of JavaScript application with the exclusion of more advanced UI features and simulated responsiveness. None the less, rather than reducing or evening the development cost burden with server side web development, it actually increased it because all of the server side development must be done and then a client side framework must be bolted on top of it. It is quite honestly the worst of both worlds because it spikes the complexity of the solution.<p>The numbers that we gathered in our research and post mortums of projects supports the conclusion that it is actually more cost effective to build two independent UI's one JavaScript UI and a reduced feature set server side based UI and route client to each according to capabilities.<p>Further, for many client the monetary outlay of developing the server side UI to support the < 1% client base that could not use a JavaScript UI was more than would ever be recouped for the investment.<p>In one of the analysis that we did it was actually cheaper to send the clients that did not have access to a supported JavaScript compatible browser a new machine than to spend the development effort to build out an independent system.<p>In all cases a better business case could be made for spending those development funds on alternative platforms like iPhone / Android / mobile client or IVR systems.<p>The segment of the market that cannot access JavaScript based applications is a very small segment and it is dwindling every day.

2209373,comment,2208056,2209279,0,0,bugsy,,,"They don't exist anymore! It may appeal to your Schadenfreude to know that shortly after this they went bankrupt - because I wasn't there and so they couldn't complete contracts and got sued into oblivion by their clients.<p>I guess I'll mention the basic problem was I had a contract with them licensing one of my patents to them when I went to work there. They then told me they wanted me to transfer complete ownership of my patent to them when it became an issue that they wanted to license it to another company, which my license did not allow (non-transferable) and they didn't want to pay for. I said no, and so they fired me, but told me if I gave them the patent I could come back to work - blackmail!<p>The other company then wanted to hire me and deal with me directly, and that's when my former employer launched legal proceedings and sabotaged my new job offer.<p>That is when I found out that a qualified and experienced IP attorney who knows the law costs a lot more ($600/hr) than a regular family attorney ($100/hr). My attorneys were top guys nationally and were very clear that the company had absolutely no case whatsoever on any of their claims.<p>It soon became apparent though that the company attorney was scheduling meetings with my attorneys solely for the purpose of bleeding me dry. For example, company attorney would demand to meet with multiple members of my firm to discuss things, and then talk slow, fumble with papers and act stupid, at a cost of $2400/hr to me because there were 4 attorneys there. My attorneys told me straight up that that was what the deal was and they called the company on their BS but the company kept trying these tactics. Eventually the company got buried in their own bad karma and gave up, but it still cost me a fortune to deal with and stole a year from my life and caused incredible stress and dismay. Lesson learned was that it simply does not matter that the law is on your side and the other people don't have a case if they are acting in bad faith.<p>The good part was that I came out of it a lot wiser and since then I absolutely will not deal with any company that insists I agree to terms I don't feel are completely fair. That decision is still the right one, decades later, and completely changed the amount of BS I was dealing with in jobs. Any one who feels uncomfortable with any clause should not agree to it and be firm. If you have talent, you will find work for reasonable people and that work will be better paid and less stress than dealing with the jerks.",1297487942

2209371,comment,2209315,2209315,0,0,rst,,,"Here's one take:<p>Look at Samsung, LG, and HTC.  All of them are making both Windows Phone 7 devices and Android ones; if Windows Phone 7 takes off, they're in the race, but if it doesn't, they'll have other stuff that's working for them.<p>Now look at Nokia.  The difference isn't what Nokia <i>will</i> be doing --- making Windows Phone 7 devices; it's what they <i>won't</i> be doing --- making Android phones.  They've taken a big, risky bet, which they could have hedged, and haven't.  And the platform they've bet on is one which allows manufacturers <i>less</i> freedom to customize and differentiate themselves than the one they've shunned.  Heck, if they just shipped stock Android, <i>that</i> would differentiate them from most of the phones on the market.  (Contrast to Windows Phone 7, where Microsoft is being very restrictive in what manufacturers can dink.  Nokia may get more freedom than some as part of this deal, but not nearly as much as the HTC Sense experience for Android.)  And you could try to say that they don't have resources to handle multiple platforms --- but if that's the issue, why are they still talking about shipping Maemo?<p>In short, this is still different from what other manufacturers are doing, but based on the announced terms of the deal, it's not really clear why it's better, and it is pretty clear why it might be worse.  There might be unannounced terms of the deal that change that calculus, but for now, people can only judge from what they can see.",1297487787

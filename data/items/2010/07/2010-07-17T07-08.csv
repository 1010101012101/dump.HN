A magnet and coil that can fit into a battery is going to be <i>much</i> smaller-- and then you still have to fit in the rectifier and capacitor.<p>All of this in the AAA form factor?

Right now the best phrase we have to describe it is ""iPhone 4 antenna problem"" -- ""Antennagate"" implies there is no (real) problem or it's at least open to debate.

I can just say that it works very well for me, and has a rich ecosystem of plugins and additional tools that I find handy.<p>On the downside, Eclipse is awfully memory hungry in my experience.

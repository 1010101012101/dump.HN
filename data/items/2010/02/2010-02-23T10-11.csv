1145145,comment,1144548,1144548,0,0,leelin,,,"Summary of paper:<p>A.) First several pages are random fluff:  Explains P, NP, NP-Hard, NP-Complete, history of P=NP, examples of NP-complete problems, examples of  market efficiency, and other very uninteresting stuff that feels like it's trying to fill out pages.<p>B.) Makes this central argument:<p>1.) If markets are efficient, then no one can come up with a consistently profitable trading strategy based on analyzing historical data.<p>2.) Model historical data as a sequence of days where the market can go up or down on any given day.<p>3.) Model a trading strategy as being long, short, or neutral the market on any given day, to be started after recognizing some pattern for the previous N days.<p>4.) To determine from historical data whether a profitable strategy exists, you'd need to try all combinations of being long, short, or neutral over some time horizon, while looking for all market patterns.  Trying all such combinations is O(3^N) or O(2^N), depending on whether you believe the expensive part is finding the strategy or finding the pattern.<p>5.) To verify that you have a winning strategy, you merely need to simulate the strategy over your historical data, which only takes O(N).<p>6.)  Therefore, it is in NP.  Similarly, it is NP-Hard because we can reduce 3-SAT to a market / trading problem.  Therefore, ""does a profitable strategy based on historical data exist?"" is in NP-complete.<p>7.)  Because our model shows finding the existence of a profitable strategy is NP-complete, then either P=NP or markets are inefficient.<p>C.)  A few comments of my own:<p>1.)  Suppose we believe the argument.  The amount of historical data is finite, so maybe some hedge funds brute-forced a solution and removed the market inefficiencies they've found.<p>2.)  I think SAT and travelling salesman are the wrong analogies, because solving both optimally can involve lots of backtracking.  A* search on a landscape with reliable heuristics might be a better analogy.  In trading markets, you don't need to try all 3^N combinations because just as in search algorithms, you have heuristics that can help prune large parts of your search space (if a strategy starts off losing money, no need to keep exploring all the 3^N combinations under it).<p>3.) The author assumes everyone represents and models the market his way.  Maybe a more clever representation makes the problem tractable.  Checkers is a solved game now, even though there are in theory infinitely many possible game histories to test.",1266922720

1145141,comment,1143613,1144080,0,0,zbyszek,,,"Agreed.  Most papers, even good ones, are hard to understand because the subject matter is hard.  They are written with the assumption of a certain amount of prior knowledge of the field, and depending on the intended audience, very little background might be explained.<p>Writing clearly is also remarkably difficult and not everyone can do it.  I have often found that the initial exposition of a scientific concept is not the easiest.  After it been been digested by the community for a while, clearer ways of explaining it might be found.<p>Now, there are controversies like the Bogdanov papers, and even successful hoaxes like the famous Sokal paper, but I think these are exceptional, and usually reviewers _will_ say that a paper is ""flat out bad"" despite, or even because of obfuscation.",1266922659

The OP is arguing that translating this statement to the real world adds nothing we did not know before. In comparing markets with NP-complete problems an interesting (but still trivial after you get the idea) paper ""Computational Complexity and Information Asymmetry in Financial Products"" by Arora et al.<p>And, also, the point of this paper is not really interesting. Even if it takes exponential time for the market to reflect _all_ the available information about something, all the efficient market hypothesis says is that the market will incorporate the information as fast as the fastest agent in incorporating that information. And this has nothing to do with P and NP (since a quadratic market can still be beat by a linear agent, and this is a market that is definitely in P).",1266922049

If you sign up, you become a customer.<p>> If I don&#x27;t understand what the service/app is for, why would I want to sign up?<p>Try to think like the site operator. They know they don&#x27;t have anything interesting to offer you, but you certainly have something interesting to offer them: your identity.<p>> If just signing up makes it legal for the company to email me, how does that still make me want to use your app?<p>Who cares? The point is to get you to sign up, reveal your personal information, not to offer you anything useful for your trouble.<p>> Just because I am forced to sign up does not mean I will be a paying customer or an active user.<p>You clearly don&#x27;t understand how the Can-Spam Act works.

That there are links is only &quot;documented&quot; at #6.<p>* Very little on document structure: only mentioned in examples, no overview let alone more precise documentation, there seems to be 5 or 6 possible _link keys but none is defined further than the examples showing it exists. Notes that the entry point will be disabled if links are disabled, said entry point&#x27;s media type is not documented and only defined as &quot;a list of links to accessible resources&quot;.<p>* Very limited linking (only tree traversal/reads), no support at all for resource alteration information in documents, how a resource is created, modified or deleted is solely out-of-band knowledge.

But I&#x27;ve even seen some paid services that pull this trick.<p>That&#x27;s because they all want to hook up, maybe sell you something, and avoid a problem with the Can-Spam Act, to wit: if they e-mail you and you&#x27;re not a customer, they&#x27;re in violation, it&#x27;s spam. If you have signed up, you&#x27;re a customer, so the Can-Spam Act no longer applies -- they can e-mail you all they want.<p>The really sleazy outfits are those that spam you, and include an opt-out link in the spam mailing. You click the link, which takes you to a sign-up page. The idea is, if you sign up, what you got isn&#x27;t spam any more -- by signing up, you turn it into a legitimate business contact.<p>The fact that the op-out-link goes to a signup page technically violates the Can-Spam Act (which requires that an opt-out procedure be both prominent and simple), but it seems no one cares about that any more.",1378835638
6361662,comment,6360474,6360474,5,0,bialecki,,,"If for some reason you can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want to implement webhooks, at least make sure you the GET endpoint for any object has a query param that supports fetching the most recently updated or created objects <i>and</i> supports pagination.<p>It sounds trivial, but you&#x27;d be surprised how many APIs don&#x27;t support one or both of those features. When you&#x27;re writing an API it might seem unnecessary to start (after all, who could ever have 1000s of <object>?), but if someone ends up polling your API frequently, having those two features can reduce a lot of unnecessary load for both you and the poller. And, of course, make sure you have an index on the created and/or updated dimensions.<p>That said, webhooks are terrific. Few things to consider when implementing them:<p>- Think carefully about the payload you send to the webhook. It&#x27;s usually a good idea to send some related objects/data because many times when someone gets a webhook payload, that&#x27;ll trigger calls to your API to get related information you could&#x27;ve reasonably sent them in the initial payload.<p>- You&#x27;ll likely want to some way to keep track of errors so if an endpoint starts returning 404s or 500s you have a way to programmatically discard it after X failed attempts.<p>- In your docs, give sample, &quot;real world&quot; payloads developers can test against. It saves times over creating a RequestBin, pushing there, copying, cURLing, etc. (Remember, you can&#x27;t set up a webhook to localhost.)<p>- A nice to have is some sort of retry capability with an exponential back-off. Servers go offline and if they get pushed webhook data then, those messages are lost. You could say, &quot;tough, it&#x27;s the consumer&#x27;s responsibility,&quot; but if having all the data is important, most people will resort to polling. (Somewhat related, you&#x27;d be surprised how often the APIs of some larger SaaS companies are &quot;offline&quot; -- e.g. returning 503 --, so these things do happen.)",1378835635

6361591,comment,6339639,6339639,2,0,robomartin,,,"My guess is that most commenters on HN have a CS background and are not immersed in the world of mechanical design.  This demo is not unlike that saying about sufficiently advanced science looking like magic.  Demos like these are definitely of the kind that provoke lots excitement from people who don&#x27;t work in the field and, generally speaking, exactly the opposite reaction from those who do.<p>I must also note that Musk is a deity on HN and, therefore, anyone posting anything counter to what he says is often met with negative reactions.  In general terms one is labeled a hater and things go downhill from there.<p>I straddle the software, electronics and mechanical design worlds and have devoted a significant amount of time and effort to mastering the tools of each discipline.  In mechanical design my tool of choice these days is Solidworks.  I have also used AutoCAD and ProE extensively.<p>I would never, ever, in a million years, want to spend eight or more hours a day moving my hands around in the air to design mechanical parts.  It would be a horrible productivity sapping experience.  A trackball and keyboard, once you&#x27;ve learned the interface, form an effortless man-machine interface to design parts with software such as Solidworks.  My preference is for trackballs.  When using one, in a very real sense, you are touching, grabbing and interacting with the objects on your screen.  It feels very natural.  More importantly, it is fast, accurate and ergonomically sustainable for long hours.<p>I realize I need to provide context for someone who comes from pure CS to get a grip on what I am saying here.  Here it is:  Imagine someone came along and suggested that instead of using VIM, your favorite editor or IDE you consider using this new interface that requires you having your hands in the air all day to manipulate graphical objects that, when linked together, create programs.<p>It would look very slick.  Perhaps they&#x27;d even make a reference to a similar concept see in a movie.  You would probably recoil at the very idea and post negative comments on HN.  Those outside the CS world would see it as an incredible potential advance in the field and call you haters for not praising an attempt to advance the art.<p>That&#x27;s exactly what we are looking at here.  I can&#x27;t think of many people who do MCAD for a living who would think this is actually useful at any level except for one:  It might be cool to have as a presentation tool.  It would be neat to allow anyone to feel like they are touching and manipulating objects in free space in an intuitive fashion.  That&#x27;s it.<p>The other more subjective point I&#x27;d like to make is that I find myself wondering why Musk/Tesla/SpaceX are burning clock cycles working on anything outside of their core missions.  The fact that he had engineers spend time on the Hyperloop and this doesn&#x27;t sit well with me.  I could be wrong, of course, and I am sure there are plenty who will point that out.  I just don&#x27;t think these companies are mature enough to engage in such pointless distractions.",1378835016

I&#x27;ve tried shovel and it does not solve our problem like we wanted. I don&#x27;t have component based benchmarks between Redis and RabbitMQ but I&#x27;ve already shared the loader.io results of our two pipelines. Some details below.<p>noelwelsh: We&#x27;re using Redis as an intermediate storage sink for RabbitMQ and instead of just passing messages from Redis to RabbitMQ, we move them in chunks. I&#x27;ll explain below why we could not move away from Redis. &quot;mbell&quot; is correct about why do it that way.<p>NOTE: this is going to be a long reply;<p>This blog post talks mostly about data acquisition, let me start by giving some background on our backend services. You may read more about VWO on visualwebsiteoptimizer.com, so I&#x27;m skipping that. We&#x27;ve multiple servers across globe which helps us do data acquisition (capturing data for analytics) and servers which serve javascript snippets which are applied on one&#x27;s website. Our users install VWO code on their website and depending on the test etc. the code from our servers is served dynamically and applied (like &quot;karolisd&quot; commented, we do it as fast as possible and we&#x27;re still tuning our systems, and it is dynamic).<p>We don&#x27;t use any CDN (such as akamai, cloudfront etc.) for our dynamic content as they fail at providing us tweaking mechanisms while serving dynamic content on same url and such a design would break user experience and we don&#x27;t want our users to keep changing the installed code on their websites -- for them it should just work. Many such services require you to install some code that would brings some js from a url, each time you modify something they may either ask you to install new code with the new url or if they&#x27;re using CDN they might send you all the changes by the same url (for ex. increase of payload size due to unnecessary data).<p>So, we have two most important requirements; one -- to do data acquisition reliably, as fast as possible with minimum payload; two -- to serve content dynamically with minimum payload and as fast as possible because it is most important for us to not slow down website of our users.<p>To do that we use a custom-compiled OpenResty (nginx mod) with luajit and our (Lua) code runs inside OpenResty offering us minimum latencies and processing speeds (no reverse proxies). At the time we started solving our scaling problem, there was no lua-resty library that does publishing from Lua/OpenResty to RabbitMQ. Writing a production grade lua-resty AMQP library would require a lot of time (you may search our discussions on openresty-en mailing list). So I started by writing an opensource stomp based library to use RabbitMQ&#x27;s STOMP adapter and STOMP was much light weight and easy to implement compared to AMQP (there are multiple versions as well). So, in our Lua/OpenResty code we had two options either to publish messages directly to RabbitMQ or to Redis. Publishing to RabbitMQ was slow due to latencies, the AMQP overhead and the small payload size (less than 1kB), it was a deal breaker for us. But running Redis locally on unix sockets to which our Lua/OpenResty code would write was much better in terms of latencies, and transferring data in chunks from Redis to RabbitMQ improved throughputs.<p>Coming back to the earlier comment on this thread, Redis does not add any failure case, instead it provides us a failover: So far I&#x27;ve seen that there may be more cases or chances of the whole datacenter (network) going down instead of a server, in that case data sits in Redis. Our cron jobs along with monitoring tools make sure local services on each servers are up and running. In case our server goes down, our Anycast DNS (with low TTL) would switch traffic to other available servers automatically. In case RabbitMQ servers/datacenter goes down, data would be pushed into it next time the network/server goes down; using reliable messaging ensures messages/chunks are written to disk (fsync) so they persist if not consumed, publisher confirms give us reliability. In case the consumers die, data sits in RabbitMQ. In case of timeouts and latencies of moving data to RabbitMQ, agentredrabbit handles that.<p>Comments, questions welcome.",1378833888

You should of course have a backup as well, as the border patrol may impound your devices while they try to decrypt them.<p>All in all, how much effort we have to do to defend ourselves from our own government is getting ridiculous.

But how do you connect to mobile and web clients for bi-directional messaging in a way that&#x27;s secure, reliable, flexible, and scaleable?<p>What if you didn&#x27;t want to open up your back-end servers to the net, but just wanted to continue communicating with RabbitMQ?  What if you did not want to require clients to support any installables or require the latest web browsers or websockets technology?<p>I think we have the answer... use PubNub&#x27;s open-source RabbitMQ adapter (https://github.com/pubnub/rabbitmq).<p>Your entire RabbitMQ deployment continues humming along just as it always did, with no changes.  The PubNub RabbitMQ adapter will work as another AMQP client, and will connect to PubNub over standard http ports 80- and 443 (no special ports or firewall shenanigans required).  The adapter will then publish/subscribe to PubNub as needed, while pushing/consuming to RabbitMQ.<p>You&#x27;ve now connected RabbitMQ to the web, without opening up your backend.  The adapter can implement business logic to scrub data before publishing/subscribing, keeping the inbound and outbound data safe.  You now support all web clients through PubNub, from the mobile clients to old, crusty web browsers.<p>The blog post url has code examples as well as video tutorials so you can see it in action.

Linus is not a cryptographer or expert in that field, despite his accolades in others.

(&quot;And a free trial!!!&quot;)<p>We learned that when your monthly price point is the size of an accounting error, <i>no one can take you seriously</i>.<p>This software was also holistic in nature: everyone, everyone, everyone has to use it for it to work well and as a core part of their organization. It&#x27;s a superset of the marketplace business problem.<p>To address these we had to charge more. Much more. This raised the stakes on both parties and also filtered out less serious buyers who would probably fail with our software.<p>The construction companies who were serious buyers really considered thoroughly whether they could implement the change; we worked with them for, sometimes, months going through how the change would take place. And training, training, training. Usage metrics. Account hand-holders. Keep them using the system.<p>--<p>As others have said, medical software is some of the hardest to break into. Medical staff HATE CHANGE, and need to. Change in the short term leads to mistakes and mistakes cost lives or careers. The system is bureaucratic, politicized and slow moving.

(Reminds me of &quot;Big in Japan&quot; first, or conversely Japanese artists having to become popular in the US before being taken seriously back in Japan.)<p>--<p>Okay, advice.<p>Sell it before you make it. If you have multiple hospital/medical contacts, play with pricing. Try outrageous things. If not, just try to work out any sort of deal and have them sign a piece of paper that says they&#x27;ll pay.<p><i>Then</i> build it.<p>Iterate with the first customer until it&#x27;s &quot;So Good They Can&#x27;t Ignore You&quot;.<p>After this, you might get better traction outside the US.

Sorry! :)  The tricks are actually not <i>that</i> interesting but I guarantee I&#x27;m not like the Infinite Detail / Euclideon guys. :)  It generates the voxels in GPU memory (About 128 MB of memory is used per chunk) - but once it renders the chunk it immediately dumps the non-critical data and reuses that rendering page.  It can still access any visible voxel in the 2D rendering (even the various chunk layers), but to access the internal voxels it has to regenerate the chunk or use the procedural generation algorithm to determine what a given point would be like.  Collision detection can still be handled pretty well via the larger chunk properties and the depth properties of the rendered chunk. So the real trick lies in procedural generation and the ability to rapidly recreate chunks as needed.  It uses ray-casting on a hexagon shaped like an isometric cube, which is nothing very advanced or new.  Let me know if I can answer in more detail - I may do a writeup on the techniques time willing. :)",1378832821

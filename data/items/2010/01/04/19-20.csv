1031080,comment,1028673,1029823,0,0,chrischen,,,"Yes it is radically different. Initially at least. I will not have a ""store"" featuring indie films. This is something I don't think I can accomplish initially, and must be slowly built towards. The barrier to entry to using our service to sell digital downloads (on their own sites) is low, but if I were to launch a digital store, I would have to erect some sort of quality minimum in order to build a reputation for that store. I would want to keep such a store from turning into YouTube. Instead, what I'm trying to accomplish immediately is more like paypal. It's a tool, a mechanism to digital download distribution. Except the difference from paypal is that I'm also offering a better post-sale experience, as a feature to the publisher to attract sales, and more customized toolset for indie filmmakers, including things that will help them market.<p>Indie filmmakers usually have their own websites. They probably don't need a community to sell their films to. Even if they do, they can target those communities themselves.<p>Hey thanks lkrubner, I think I just got my answer to the ""What are you making?"" question.",1262635015

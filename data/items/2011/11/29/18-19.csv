3291641,comment,3290429,3290429,4,0,mutagen,,,"API churn isn't limited to small companies. The FedEx shipping API is on version 9 and my last conversation with their developer support indicated they are currently ending support for version 5 and supporting versions 6 through 9. I certainly understand that business requirements, security standards, and development practices change and that it doesn't make sense for them to support what they were doing in 1995. However, I'd expect a little bit of what Google is doing [1] in trying to build sustainable APIs. On the other hand, maybe it is a good thing for security and IT practice to have a forced requirement that the software and systems from 10 years ago change.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3291136"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3291136</a>",1322593198
3291640,comment,3288671,3290305,4,0,electromagnetic,,,"From experience creative writing (IE Fiction, journal-columns (life blogging), reviews, even a lot of non-fiction) are hard to force. It takes a lot of breaks and 'spur of the moment' events to the point I use my iPhone for writing so when I get that urge it doesn't matter if I'm on lunch at my day job or waiting at a bus stop, or as often the case, on the toilet.<p>Newspaper journalism I believe can be forced. IMO it's like high school essay writing, you find your source and you just learn to churn. With some newspapers this can be so bad that you notice the 'filler' attempts where about 2/3 of the way through they go into ""summary"" mode and simply pad the ending of the article with the exact same info they had in the first 1/3.<p>By 'from experience' I mean I've worked as a reviewer, I've got my own personal blog (one of my pieces actually hit the front page of HN back in the 1Q of 2011 IIRC, and a few have popped up other places) and I'm now pushing through for a novel - I've had one short story published and a lot of editor comments (which is great, I've never received a form rejection letter, even from places that are notorious for them; my problem is that with a short story I see little point of struggling to edit it on the chance someone might say yes, when I might as well learn my mistake and write something else because there's always the chance a story will grab an editor and they'll say 'hell, I can fix the mistakes' - and having worked as a reviewer I trust editors to fix problems I don't know are problems)<p>Like the guy who posted the automated sports writer, it's not difficult to take the stats and say ""Campbell scored a last minute goal winning the game"" when campbell was the last person to score and it happened in the last minute of play. It's merely filtering data and rewriting a standard comment.<p>It's not far from news of a house fire: did the house burn down? yes/no; if no make 'devastating' comment. was people caught inside? yes/no; if yes did they survive? yes/no; if no make 'tragedy' comment; if yes did they escape? yes/no; if yes make 'valiant escape' comment / if no make 'heroic rescue' comment.<p>It's quite different when you have to write 200 words from a basic formula with 20 keywords, compared to writing 80,000 words from a basic formula with 20 keywords. Yes Star Wars and Harry Potter might have same basic principles (orphan, living with aunt and uncle, special powers, special connection to main antagonist). However, I'm never failed to be amused when someone says it's unoriginal or a rip off, but those same people will read article after article on their sports teams and not think it's ripped off when the articles a probably written by an intern in a coat closet switching words on a template. But simply Vader being or not being Luke's father would have made a major story diversion (IE Luke wouldn't have gone to Endor to confront his father, Vader wouldn't have turned good and killed the emperor, etc.)",1322593185

As a kid I was always yelled at for playing with things too much, or touching things or having to get a tactile feel for things in order to learn them.<p>Personally I feel like in order to truly understand things I need to get a 'feel' for it and having multiple sources of inputs into my brain helps a lot. So reading/listening to someone speak/seeing someone speak/playing with it for fun/doing work with it are all things I need to do if I want to have a strong understanding.<p>This tends to be a weakness for me in my courses because I have a tendency to take longer to pick up abstract mathematical concepts than my classmates. The advantage is in the next course, say calc II, I usually have a deeper understanding and am able to make up for it. I am not sure if this is a result of me doing more work with the subjects or if its because I was able to learn it in more 'ways' than they were.<p>Chewing gum doesn't seem to work for long periods, in my experience, because the gum looses flavor and or changes consistency so much that it just barely distracts me.

To highlight relevance, we'd have to get users to fill out a questionnaire about their race, age, interests, etc. This is a possibility down the road I suppose.<p>That's why I created the 'trust' feature though. If you spot an Indian reviewer, add them to your 'trust' circle. Later on, we can get smart and provide 'trust' recommendations for you, but that's a future feature to tackle.<p>Also, you're correct, voting reviewers have existed for awhile, but they're hardly highlighted by those sites as important. We feel like by encouraging voting from day 1, we can start a culture where it's widely used. Maybe that's a bit naive, but emphasizing how important it is to site functionality should hopefully encourage use (just like how it's used in Reddit/HN).",1322592123

They stated it was because the app itself burdens the carrier network, however they offered us no way to remedy the solution We were very clear when listing the app what the primary function was and they even followed up with several questions and requested a video demo then they approved the application.<p>We strongly disagree that it burdens a carriers network, as from our own data history on more than 500,000 users we know the average user consumes less than 200 MBs of data per month on Tether. In comparison, one TV show streamed from Netflix, an approved Apple App, could easily be in the 300-400 MBs range. Sure, there are some users that will consume way more than the average however thats the case with any of these types of products.<p>Our team is very disappointed in Apples decision; as we strongly believe we help carriers better monetize their data stream by pushing customers into new data tiers further increasing their bottom-line. It is very anti-competitive to not allow any Tethering application to enter into this space to innovate. Our team has created a lot of innovative solutions for the BlackBerry product, which we were hoping to port over to the iPhone like end-to-end encryption, compression, website filtering and port filtering.<p>According to Apple, users who purchase iTether before it was pulled will continue to be able to use the product.<p>Our team is evaluating all of our options Stay tuned.</i>",1322591737

Basically, you 'skip' to any number of places you like, which forms a sort of itinerary with directions and ETAs.

The site can be largely experienced w/o a user account, although feel free to create a temp account if you like (fake email or not). I'll delete any accounts/reviews/etc created and hide the URL again after everyone's had adequate time to play around with the site.<p>Some background info:\nFor the past 4 months, I've been developing SkipScotch, a starting point to increase credibility of online reviews. It's not the ultimate solution, but I'm thinking the structure is in place to get started down the right path. Some highlights:<p>- Reviews are given based on service experienced, and ratings are calculated per service offered. Currently, we are planning on the basic average of reviews to calculate ratings, but we have a more accurate weighted average designed that we'd love to implement (we'd need a decent amount of reviews for the weighted average to matter). Read about the weighted average at http://blog.skipscotch.com/2011/11/only-way-to-do-reviews-right-way-is-to.html (it's mentioned towards the end of the post)<p>- Reviews can be up-voted/down-voted by users. Points awarded for reviews contribute to a reviewer's 'wisdom' score<p>- Scoring reviews/reviewers based on quality should increase credibility of reviews in SkipScotch. We have plenty of future goals with these credibility scores, like utilizing them in a weighted average, review filter, reviewer ranks, and rewards for respected reviewers.<p>- Individual reviewers can be 'trusted', which provides a new trusted rating along with the public rating<p>- Events can exist per service and are searchable through the basic search. Examples currently implemented are trivia and karaoke nights<p>Reviews and ratings are randomly generated for demo purposes. Businesses and events are real and accurate. Reviews show up in each service's show page, simply so they can be experienced regardless of service visited. Our revenue model exists, but I won't get into it here. Just wanted to highlight that we haven't overlooked it.<p>There's 2 founders, but I'm the only developer. This has been entirely bootstrapped. I did not know RoR (what the site is built with) prior to developing SkipScotch, although I've been a full-time software engineer for 3 years. Design is also not my specialty, so I realize there may be issues with it.<p>I'd love any feedback you can offer, especially on strategy and product launch. I realize it'll be tough to solve the chicken and egg problem, but I have a few strategies in mind (if you have some, I'd love to hear them!).<p>Any signups we can get through the landing page will be greatly appreciated. Feel free to contact me directly at founders@skipscotch.com for any reason whatsoever. Cheers and many thanks!",1322590771

It's a curious example of an evolutionary dead-end; the ability to store 30 telephone numbers in my watch was barely convenient, though gimmicky, when I was in high school. This is true no longer.

Excellent point, and I can go through the blah blah of how we take security seriously, adhere to standards, and that we are proactive, but instead of boring you with what you can read on the site I'd like to really answer your question.  Aside from getting piece of mind by reading the terms of use and the privacy policy (which no one reads anyway), trust is something that is hard to win over on the Internet.  In the real world I like to think that trust has to be lost not gained (at least with me personally).   However, on the Internet its a new game, you have to show that you are trustworthy and reliable somehow before people think about even looking at your service.  We've been struggling to find a way to show this because we're a new, small startup with not much more to offer than our word.  Still in alpha, we're trying to get some trustworthy partners (specifically service providers such as tmobile) to strengthen our word.   However at the risk of sounding like privacy is not our priority (it is definitely our priority), with any company, big or small, trustworthy or not, if its in the cloud its at a higher risk, but in my opinion the benefits far greatly outweigh the small risk.<p>Short answer: We will do what it takes to ensure that you're data is secure and in your control.<p>2. We plan to implement a freemium model.  Once we introduce our full feature set we will begin to charge for some of them.  I don't like to argue semantics of whether we're a small business or a startup, all I can say is that we are building a service that we believe in and want to use personally.  Its something we believe is lacking in the world, and until iCloud came a long no one was doing anything right (iCloud still lacks platform independence though).  We believe that being in control of your data, being able to do with it what you want and take it with you where you like, is a new-era human right.<p>Short answer: No plans to sell it off.<p>Hope that answered your questions, and if you want to try the site please provide any feedback you may have so we can improve based on customer needs aligned with our own.",1322589689

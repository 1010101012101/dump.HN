It is always ok to say, &quot;If you love me, and I love the firm, I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll find a way to make a deal.&quot;<p>The best way to have leverage to have another opportunity in hand.  Then you can say, &quot;I will be fully transparent, and won&#x27;t play any games with you, but I do want you know I&#x27;m talking to someone else too.&quot;  That lets them know that you are valued.  You just have to be polite, and not turn it into a multi-stage bidding war.  But it does give you the ability to say, &quot;I love your firm.  I don&#x27;t want to start a 2 week cycle of bidding, but if you could at least close 2/3 of the gap in offers, I won&#x27;t have to worry about paying rent.&quot;",1395237570

7428602,comment,7426581,7428498,1,0,einhverfr,,,"Ok.  So suppose you have feeds of data that lead into your database.  These come from various sources and some of the feeds go through different pathways in processing before being entered.  Let&#x27;s say that for some hypothetical legitimate reason some feeds are truncated to the date.  These all get stored as timestamps in your database.<p>Now many db&#x27;s (maybe even most) will happily cast dates to timestamps, but they do this by filling in 00:00:00 for the time.  If you have to special case these in your front end, being able to treat truncated datetimes as having no date could be quite helpful.<p>Now this would not be an ideal design, I think we&#x27;d all agree.  It would be very remotely possible a date could be 00:00:00.000000 in time and so you&#x27;d have some false positives.  Ideally we&#x27;d put a flag on the record to say the date had been truncated, but you know, there are always cases where legacy code gets in the way of sane fixes.<p>In an ideal world this might never be a useful feature.  In the real world I could imagine a number of uses in working around systems which one cannot reasonably safely or easily modify.<p>Yes, you could special case check for midnight.

But this might be a good thing.<p>As I&#x27;ve said elsewhere, I&#x27;d be pleased to obtain a junior tech position if it was a good match. But you&#x27;re looking for specialists, aren&#x27;t you?<p>I might be mistaken, but perhaps you&#x27;re not familiar with how generalists operate. If this is the case, I&#x27;d prefer that you proceed to &quot;circular file&quot; my resume.

I&#x27;ll Twitter Bootstrap it sometime. :P<p>2) If somebody does not understand what it means to build a Linux distro from scratch, and feels that this is irrelevant to their firm, they are not looking for a generalist. Accordingly, I&#x27;m not a match for them and they&#x27;re not a match for me.<p>As a side note, yes, over the past two decades, I&#x27;ve written literally hundreds of small servers and clients from scratch, plus a number of large ones.<p>Should all of the different servers and clients be listed on the resume? If so, would you look through the list, searching for some past project that matched some current need?<p>Do you understand what a generalist does?<p>3) I feel that this point is incorrect. You&#x27;re thinking like a specialist here.<p>Nobody is going to hire me to work on DOS or AIX. Well, not AIX anyway; there is still some DOS work going on. But it&#x27;s the range of things that I wish to convey here. Not the specialties.<p>If somebody such as yourself looks at my resume hoping to find a specialist, and dismisses the parts that illustrate a generalist background, it&#x27;s best for all concerned, including me. that they toss the resume.<p>4) No idea what I&#x27;m talking about? :-) Heh.

So we went for the highest-level certification on our products, which required surviving 1,000,000 gremlins.<p>At first I was very skeptical that it would find any meaningful bugs, but in fact it was very good at finding memory leaks and edge cases. In the end it took us several weeks to finally be able to survive the 1M gremlins without a crash. A single run of 1M gremlins would take about 24 hours.<p>In later years they added the capability to supply your own dictionary of values to apply to certain inputs so that gremlins could get past validation, and it would also save the entire state of the device every 10K events so that you could easily reproduce errors that Gremlins found.<p>I could definitely see this as a good way to stress-test certain parts of your app, though it takes a ton of time, and frankly without surrounding tooling (like resource monitoring, saving &quot;state&quot;) it wouldn&#x27;t be practical.",1395237033

So,\ntake random variables\nX(1), X(2), ... and assume that they \nare independent and all have the\nsame distribution with\nfinite\nstandard deviation.  Then the central\nlimit theorem says essentially that \nas \npositive integer n grows to infinity\nthe distribution of the sum<p>X(1) + ... + X(n)<p>will converge to normal (really should divide\nthe sum by square root of n).<p>So, where might we get some such<p>X(1) + ... + X(n)?<p>Sure, from Brownian motion where \nthere are many little bumps \nand the bumps come close enough to\nsatisfying the hypothesis.  So\ncan use this also in thermodynamics.<p>So, there are places where a normal \nassumption is justified.<p>But just making a normal assumption\nfor essentially all experimental errors\nas needed for the <i>accepted</i> five sigma\ncriterion is close to a weird religion\nand not flattering to a modern science.<p>What physics is doing with their\nfive sigma criterion is a statistical\nhypothesis test.\nMy examples of distribution free hypothesis\ntests via resampling is a \nbetter justified and more\nconservative and <i>robust</i> way to do\nan hypothesis test.  Physicists might\nconsider using such.<p>Such distribution-free statistical methods\nform a large field.<p>My example of the role of\nHilbert space is quite\npractical.<p>If you want to explain to the common\nman in the street why physics likes\ntheir five sigma criterion, then,\nsure, you need the normal assumption.\nThen you should mention that there\nphysics is making a normal assumption.<p>There you might not confuse the common\nman in the street with a claim that \nin making this normal assumption physics\nis close to drinking some swill of\nboiled tails of rats and bats.<p>But with the now high interest in\ncomputer science of <i>big data</i>,\n<i>machine learning</i>, etc. I was\nassuming that the HN audience could\nand should hear the real stuff --\nthat in what physics is doing,\nthere&#x27;s a normal (Gaussian) assumption\nin there.",1395236358

Add to the mix the veiled glorification of the twenties as a magical time to go hard (where ultimately everyone goes home), it can become an incredibly distracting echo chamber that one has arrived.<p>Something happens every few years though on the path of being a specialist, you get deep enough into one skill that it overlaps into another skill.  The specific few skills collected in the first few years, become a specific 5-10 with equal depth.<p>Take someone who has developed 15 to 40 years and imagine how many cycles of learning they have been through to implement similar algorithms in multiple syntaxes.<p>That&#x27;s someone I want to learn from when I shape my aporoaches, instead of having to feed my own snowflake quotient to relearn the same lessons before me.<p>As a polyglot, I&#x27;ve been programing for 20 years and am only in my mid-30&#x27;s. Most developers will end up the same. way I&#x27;ve ended up with enough web, desktop and mobile development, along with the hardware and networking experience that building these solutions once required in addition to programming alone.  It&#x27;s full stack across hardware and software and networking, not the full-stack of frontend and backend dev that specialists espouse as full stack.  I sure as hell didn&#x27;t plan on this path,  maybe it&#x27;s the path of a lifelong problem solver.<p>One thing that some twenty something specialists may not yet have noticed is that programming is a separate skill from the syntax of any given language.  The experience of figuring out how to do what you already know in a new syntax. It seems there can be more fascination in recreating libraries that have existed for decades, but not what the next leap is.<p>There&#x27;s a fundamental mistake most recruiters are making too. They aren&#x27;t qualified or trained to hire for technical positions. In the hiring I do and references I give, recruiters are generally clueless without their checklist. Programming isn&#x27;t a skill like knowing how to drive a forklift. It&#x27;s much deeper,  and with the correct type of polyglot developer much more transferable between languages.<p>I&#x27;m inclined to work with an experienced generalist more often than not because I prefer to work with others who not only keep up, but help lead the strategic charge. Depending on the problem, younger specialists often go through relearning what experience has already taught. Both skillsets are valuable and necessary on any team, but I have my preference.<p>My advice, is to consider focus on a highly fluid and evolving area of technology that is in high demand, pays well, and you can effortlessly pick up.  It&#x27;s where you&#x27;re talents shine. One area is mobile development.  Build some projects and spin current skills into the next area.  It will better highlight your ability to integrate everything from top to bottom.<p>I admire and am in respect of your experience and journey through creating so many solutions. If there&#x27;s an interest to connect offline I&#x27;d love to learn more about your story to see if I may be able to help and if I may be able to learn more from your experience.<p>Will anyone who is half good at what they do will end up in any different situation than this in 20 years?  Our creators need to keep creating. Maybe there is an evolution and growth needed in our field for the highly experienced.",1395236067

I also created this account through Tor, so HN&#x27;s operators should have no idea who I am.<p>For example, you have done an experiment below of posting comments through tor using the newly-created account &quot;throughtor&quot;: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=throughtor"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=throughtor</a><p>If you turn on &quot;showdead&quot; in your profile, you&#x27;ll see that account has a bunch of dead comments.  Those comments are dead because the &quot;throughtor&quot; account is less than two weeks old, so HN&#x27;s system automatically kills them since they&#x27;re posted through tor.  Once two weeks elapse, you&#x27;ll be able to post comments and they won&#x27;t be struck down.  (Two weeks is the time it takes for the &quot;new account&quot; status to wear off.)<p>This is a spam prevention technique, and it&#x27;s necessary in order to drastically reduce the amount of work moderators have to do to filter spam.<p>So, anyone who wants to post anonymously on HN should open up Tor Browser and create an account right now, and save it for a rainy day sometime in the future.<p>Remember not to use the same password as your regular HN account, because you&#x27;ll give your identity away if you do.  In addition to the fact that there&#x27;s nothing stopping any server from logging every password across every service, HN also stores passwords as unsalted SHA-1, so two identical passwords on two different HN accounts will be stored as the same hash in the database, making it trivial to detect your real identity.<p>At least, unsalted SHA-1 was the case as of arc3.1, which is now several years old.  Kogir probably changed it to something more sane in the meantime.  But I highly doubt anyone will be able to break into HN&#x27;s server running BSD anyway, so the unsalted SHA-1 isn&#x27;t really a concern.  This is just a reminder that every piece of information you provide is a piece of information that can be used to determine your identity.<p>And if you use this information to create more work for HN&#x27;s operators, then I will ssh into your macbook and scare the crap out of you in the middle of the night by setting your volume to 100% and using text-to-speech.  But seriously, don&#x27;t be lame.  It&#x27;s valuable that we are permitted any anonymity at all.",1395235783

7428458,comment,7427542,7427542,5,0,candybar,,,"One big problem here is that his resume looks great to technical people, but is mostly incomprehensible to non-technical people.  My experience is that technical managers are more biased towards younger people than non-technical managers because that&#x27;s how they, as managers, add most value and can get credit for work done.  Older, more experienced engineers are more likely to threaten their authority and less likely to fit into their vision of how development ought to be done or value their advice or mentorship.<p>On the other hand, non-technical managers, have much more of a need for experienced leads they can trust that can manage the technical aspects and offer advice so that they don&#x27;t appear clueless to the rank & file and management.  Non-technical managers are also unlikely to be able to have the ability to sort through resumes of inexperienced college graduates and distinguish between good programmers and bad programmers.<p>Furthermore, at most non-software companies is that the further you go in your career, the less likely that you will report to a technical manager because experienced technical people are expected to able to deliver business value directly, without having to go through a chain of technical management.  All of this means the older and more experienced you get, the more your resume has to make sense to non-technical people.  This is doubly true if you&#x27;re not a technical specialist that can solve difficult problems other technical people encounter.<p>As it stands, the resume looks like an extrapolation of the kind of stuff that people like to see when they hire a junior programmer out of school or otherwise young programmers.  This is why a lot of people here have a visceral positive reaction.  It looks good, but it&#x27;s gone too far and it&#x27;s a bit out of character.  We like to see hardcore technical stuff in young people&#x27;s resumes to distinguish contenders from pretenders but people who are hiring older engineers usually don&#x27;t care about that.  It&#x27;s also clear that he qualifies as a specialist in some of the things he&#x27;s done, but we don&#x27;t know what they are, because they are lost in the noise of everything he&#x27;s ever done.",1395235698

What did -you- do? What experience do -you- now have that could translate to other projects? &quot;Core was a Perl server that collected binary data from upstream devices, stored data using SQL, and relayed it to clients as XML over HTTP.&quot; tells me about the project, but not what -you- did, not what experiences -you- now have. Even better if you can highlight keywords for me.

They are looking to match a certain set of relevant keywords/terms. What message do you want to send to someone in three seconds/what words/terms do you want to be matched against?

One thing that helps her classes is that she always explains why they need to learn something, and she never introduces a lesson that doesn&#x27;t further her own learning outcomes that she has set up (for intro classes she structures such that students are ready for her upper level courses, and for those courses she structures such that students will be able to succeed not only in English but also in other areas as well).<p>One thing that&#x27;s very common (check out the CCCC literature on the subject, and as a matter of fact my wife is presenting there this week) is trying to find ways to ignite student engagement. You have thousands of extremely bright people who expend countless hours simply trying to figure out how to make students care. That to me does not point to a failure of teachers. And on that let me recount my own college experience:<p>I was a shitty student for undergrad. I didn&#x27;t go to class, I didn&#x27;t do the reading, I didn&#x27;t do the work, and I failed all the tests. And this isn&#x27;t just for classes I dislikes, it was for all of them. There was no specific reason for it though my wife and I were broke the whole time, but really that&#x27;s just an excuse I told myself. And so eventually I brought my GPA up from a .5 to a 2.6 so that I could graduate (it was very fucking hard to do that, the system is stacked against you mathematically). Then I decided to go to graduate school and I kicked ass and took names. I don&#x27;t know what changed but I became &quot;the surprise star of the class&quot; (professor&#x27;s words) multiple times and when I graduated I had a 3.9 (only because by the end I had 3 full time jobs as well as taking a full course load, so I phoned in a final assignment that was worth a huge chunk of my GPA in one class).<p>In all of those cases it had nothing to do with my professors. They were kind, entertaining, generous with their time, and worked very hard to try to keep me engaged. The turn around came when I decided to take ownership of my education and of my career afterwards.",1395234468

7428313,comment,7428156,7428156,7,0,afandian,,,"I&#x27;ve written code in a few job interviews (and been in the opposite position, asking someone to write code in an interview). In all cases they were more interested (rightly so) about the conversation around the interpretation of the question, discussion over the analysis of the problem and logic required to satisfy the problem. The act of writing the code was very much secondary. Like &quot;now prove you could implement what you just described&quot;. Decontextualised appraisal of the resultant code written seems somewhat to be missing the point. Perhaps other places do things differently but this seems to be based on a shallow analysis of the interview process as I have experienced it.<p>I can see that there are facilities for discussion in the app, but when the examples say &quot;this guy&#x27;s fast&quot; and show up and down-voting based on scores, and then arriving at a hiring recommendation based on those scores... that seems to point squarely at a mechanical hiring process. Then again it says &quot;top coder&quot; rather than &quot;best software engineer&quot; or &quot;most competent developer&quot;. Maybe it&#x27;s a cultural thing.",1395234196

But, as someone who was programming (hobby) in the 80s, I think there&#x27;s some value here (and of course I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s purely defensive and me-focused, but maybe it is).<p>You mentioned elsewhere &quot;Drop the me of 30 years ago into the technology environment of today and I would be completely lost.&quot;  Perhaps, but many people <i>today</i> are completely lost too.  The &quot;you&quot; of 30 years ago had characteristics - curiosity, problem-solving, etc - that informed the experiences.  Over time, perseverance was demonstrated with an accumulation of related experiences.<p>The specific experiences of programming in 1985 are not relevant to most problems of today, but a demonstrated history of successful logical thinking applied to a variety of computers/data/projects is not irrelevant nor meaningless.<p>EDIT: Rereading the second half of your post, I <i>agree</i> with you on the second half - drop hobbies, drop older tech references, etc - lose the extraneous stuff in general from general purpose resumes.  Lose date references in general, I think (graduation dates, etc).  Focus on things that are relevant to modern work practices/tools.<p>Perhaps you were meaning all that older stuff is meaningless in terms of a resume?  I agree.  It&#x27;s the sort of stuff that might come out in an interview or two, depending on who you&#x27;re talking with.  Telling a 24 year old about doing C64 assembly programming does no good, and wastes time - that is essentially meaningless in terms of general tech job hunting.

They don&#x27;t dare do anything without the carriers&#x27; approval, even though they have a much bigger market share worldwide.<p>On top of all of this, the carriers still get to put their crap on Android phones, too.

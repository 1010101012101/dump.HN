For example, you can use your social media account login to access your fitness tracker account. In effect, the social media company is vouching that the same person is logging in each time they access the tracker website.<p>Allowing third-party credentials are beneficial to businesses because it saves them time and resources in managing identities. For users, the benefit comes from not having another username, password, or a second-factor credential to manage and remember.<p>While these arrangements are becoming more common, organizations are finding it a time-consuming task to manage each relationship, or third-party integration. The dominant solution is a service called brokered identity management in which “identity brokers” manage the integration relationships between organizations and credential providers. Organizations can use an identity broker to manage multiple third-party credentialing options instead of having to manage each separately. However, for users, there is a concern that these connections create the opportunity for a breach, or exposure of personal information, as well as for the broker to track a user’s online activity.<p>The “Privacy-Enhanced Identity Brokers” project will examine how privacy-enhancing technologies, leveraging market-dominant standards, can be integrated into identity broker solutions to meet the privacy objectives of users and organizations. This project is a joint effort between the NCCoE and the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace National Program Office (NSTIC NPO).<p>Ultimately, this project will result in a NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide, a publicly available description of the practical steps needed to implement a cybersecurity reference design.",1446735410

It may be necessary to hire remote, or pay for relocation, or in the extreme cases open remote offices.<p>- The &#x27;qualifications&#x27; may need to be revisited. What are you requiring as a qualification? Is it something a poor black person would have significantly more difficulty in achieving compared to a white person, due to socioeconomic disparities? Is it possible you could find other qualities that work as similar qualifications that black people might be more likely to have?<p>In order for there to be more black applicants, we need to help there to <i>be</i> more black applicants. This can mean many things, such as contacting local black communities and asking them what your company can do to help adults achieve a job at your company, or helping to improve the roadblocks for young kids to get a good education.<p>I know, I know; actually trying to help people can be a burden. But it will help people who continue to be oppressed by a society that does not care about them.

Small propellors are less efficient than large ones, and you&#x27;re putting virtually the entire wing in prop wash, which is going to screw up the airflow. I&#x27;m sure the approach <i>works</i>, but I don&#x27;t see it working <i>well</i> compared to the more typical solutions with one or two engines on small aircraft.<p>I also don&#x27;t see how this design makes VTOL easy. That design involves rotating the entire wing by 90 degrees to transition between horizontal and vertical flight. That&#x27;s a <i>huge</i> complication over conventional aircraft where the wing structure is fixed. I can see how it might be a better approach if you already need VTOL, but if you&#x27;re content with using a runway then using this design is going to massively complicate everything.<p>Finally, none of this appears to address the question of catastrophic failures versus benign ones. This design will greatly improve safety in the case where a motor just stops producing power.

In that sense, Thiel obviously is referring to dilution in profits per time interval moving forward. So driving the prices from X to 0 per time interval <i>is</i> diluting profits in that sense.<p>And if one looks at a very large, long term view of things, overall profit will be competed away too. So in a perfect competition, assuming the person shuts business with no loss, all capital ever earned will be competed away. Because competition typically drives prices way below the point where profits are 0, it drives it down to the point where overall profit ever earned is 0. Companies frequently sell at loss for market share.",1446734364

It&#x27;s an anti-depressant, not an anti-psychotic or anything like that as I just have depression.<p>I felt restless that night, and I&#x27;d just been made redundant, so I drove my car to an all-night diner. For whatever reason, I somehow managed to go through a red light and a cop pulled me over and issued me with a $500 ticket.<p>I basically felt destroyed inside. I&#x27;d just lost my job, I was hungry, and I felt I&#x27;d just let down my family - and I was suffering from withdrawal from the anti-depressants. I freaked out, left my car and wandered the streets. I honestly can&#x27;t recall much, but I do know it started raining on me and I do know I was thinking about death. The police came and put me in an ambulance. I arrived in the ED, and was placed in a mental health ward.<p>It was the worst experience of my life. I have never been treated so badly, or had my rights and dignity stripped away so thoroughly and systematically. They didn&#x27;t chart my medication properly, they put me in a freezing room overnight with not enough bedsheets, the building leaked everywhere (even the light sockets had water going through it), there were people having psychotic episodes or hearing voices, it was terrible food and no staff gave me any counselling or even asked how I was. What&#x27;s worse was that I recovered very, very quickly so I was fully cognizant of what was happening. When I asked for my correct medication, I was told I was being unreasonable and &quot;You don&#x27;t get anywhere here by being demanding you know!&quot; was the answer given to me by the nurse on duty (I put in a complaint and then admitted they had made a major mistake in charting my medication).<p>So THAT&#x27;S why we don&#x27;t institutionalise people. I don&#x27;t care what facility it is, if the person isn&#x27;t harming themselves, that&#x27;s the wrong place for them. I can assure you, if I ever have thoughts of suicide, I will <i>never</i> admit it to the police or any health worker in case they put me back in that place. One night in that place was more than enough. I will either commit the act (God, I hope it never gets that bad!) or I&#x27;ll suffer in silence.",1446733572

It is low status, so it is easy to demonize, much like &quot;crack-head&quot; or &quot;meth-head&quot; in the US.<p>So, people is afraid of <i>mariguanos</i>. They do marginal jobs, if at all, then some end up resorting to petty crime to fund their habit. There is also a correlation between drug use and violent crime. I personally think that deviant types will display both higher use rates and higher violence rates than the general population, but most people assume causation right away.<p>It also does not help that the Catholic Church has taken a very clear cut stance about that. That is not the root cause of people feelings; if the Church took a similar stance against alcohol abuse, literally no one but a handful of old ladies would listen to them. But the Church (as a political agent) is scoring cheap points on the Supreme Court now, and there is very little cost to do that, so they keep doing it.<p>Therefore, the results of the poll reflect a feeling from the Mexican people: that the government is failing to protect them - again, - and betraying their interest - also again.",1446733202

Like they did for millenia before that too. Having adopted christianism doesn&#x27;t mean people get perfect or all good or something.<p>It&#x27;s more of a moral compass than actual everyday conformance. We might point the &quot;hypocrisy&quot; but then we ignore the importance of having a moral compass, even if don&#x27;t follow it all the time, which is that it helps shape mentalities, laws and practices.<p>And that&#x27;s something that doesn&#x27;t happen in a day -- it takes centuries of slow progress, while the new values kick in, to the point that their nominal carrier isn&#x27;t even needed anymore (e.g. we now have codified christian originated values in non-religious forms, including in the Declaration of Independence).<p>><i>Also, the Nazis thought they were doing God&#x27;s work; they had written on their belt &quot;God is with us&quot; (Gott mit uns), which they did not invent (the origin is ancient) but did not suppress either.</i><p>They never had any special relationship with the church -- only attempted to keep it to not alienate the huge christian population, but first cleaning it of jewish influence (including lots of new testament). The &quot;Gott mit uns&quot; is just a relic, not a central tenet of their philosophy.<p>Which is not exactly tied to the christian god&#x27;s either, it has more to do with the pagan gods of the past, the kind Wagner also celebrated. Early tendencies in 20th century Germany, that later turned pro-nazi, were in favor of such a pagan revival, including naked dances/rituals in the forests, occultism, and other such BS.<p>The fact that Jesus was jewish itself is enough of an issue for most top nazi&#x27;s to avoid christianity altogether (although they also maintained that he wasn&#x27;t, in an attempt to keep the devout masses with them).<p>See also:\n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/New-Religions-Nazis-Karla-Poewe/dp/0415290252"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/New-Religions-Nazis-Karla-Poewe/dp/041...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Black-Sun-Esoteric-Politics-Identity/dp/0814731554"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Black-Sun-Esoteric-Politics-Identity/d...</a><p>and especially:\n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Unholy-Alliance-History-Involvement-Occult/dp/0826414095/ref=pd_sim_14_4?ie=UTF8&dpID=51HSJFJMRRL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR108%2C160_&refRID=0AE8XN59C2JAPTSZWPZA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Unholy-Alliance-History-Involvement-Oc...</a>",1446733184

Conceptually speaking, the idea goes something like:<p>1. Large-scale producers can always just create a trademark and market it. Customers will be able to recognize the product and evaluate it based on its reputation.<p>2. Small-scale producers, however, lack the reach to advertise and be recognized on their own. But what if they&#x27;re making a traditional, high-end product for which their region is famous? Well, we could set up a <i>shared</i> &quot;brand&quot;, where anybody from the right region can agree to follow traditional recipes and have their quality judged. And eventually, customers will realize that <i>Parmigiano-Reggiano</i> means &quot;a certain kind of really good traditional Parmesan cheese from Italy.&quot;<p>Under this system, the right way to think of things like &quot;champagne&quot; and &quot;Tennessee Whiskey&quot; is to treat them as a particular kind of brand. Any company can sell products under this brand, provided (a) they come from the right region, and (b) they meet a certain set of quality standards.<p>The system of AOC/DOC seems to work well for both &quot;foodie&quot; customers (who want to be able to recognize a high-quality traditional product), and small- to mid-size producers (who get to pool their branding efforts). The only cost of this system is that names like &quot;Tennessee Whiskey&quot; essentially become international trademarks under the control of a regional organization.",1446733135

I don&#x27;t want people to refrain from putting things out there, just because they don&#x27;t want to feel obligated to support them.<p>I have a public blog, where I try to maintain quality, and a semi-private blog where I try to allow myself to post stuff I&#x27;m not sure about, stuff that&#x27;s not interesting to anyone other than me, stuff I don&#x27;t necessarily want associated with my public persona, and so on. I know others do similar things.[1]<p>I think there&#x27;s no particular mechanism to do that with open source, but it might be valuable. Perhaps I could have two github accounts, one where I&#x27;ll put anything I feel like, and one where I put stuff I&#x27;m proud of and want to remain proud of. If something&#x27;s on my &quot;real&quot; github, I&#x27;m saying that if you ask for support I&#x27;ll try to help you, if you report a bug I&#x27;ll try to fix it. If it&#x27;s on, let&#x27;s call it my shithub, there&#x27;s no social contract. Take a look if you want, and feel free to report bugs, but I might just say &quot;yeah, that&#x27;s a bug&quot;. Or even just &quot;not interested in that project any more, I&#x27;m not going to bother confirming this&quot;.<p>Then, if you want to follow this method and also want to make most of your code public, you can write down the 100, put the ten on your shithub, and publish one to your github.<p>[1] E.g. <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slatestarcodex.com/</a> versus <a href=""http://slatestarscratchpad.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slatestarscratchpad.tumblr.com/</a>",1446732405

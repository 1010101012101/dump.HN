How do I find out if I can trust them? Extensive interview process. Is their business sustainable? Have they worked with freelancers before? Do they have references for me?<p>2. I have clients pay me up front. No, seriously. I have a contract that lists my rate and asks for the money up front. If they want different payment terms, we can negotiate from there (and usually to a point that we're both happy with).<p>3. I don't let myself get 'underwater' with a client. I use Harvest to monitor the time I spend working on client projects. It sends me a notification when I get within (80%) of the time allotted on the contract. I have a text expander snippet that I fire off to the client with something like 'Hey, we're at 80% of the time you've paid for on the project' and let them know if I think we'll need more time or need to reduce the scope.<p>4. I attempt to collect in this order:<p>(a) Phone call to the company [the person I'm working with on their side] confirming they received my invoice (10 days after due)\n(b) Phone call to the person who signed my contract confirming they received my invoice (15-20 days)\n(c) Repeat phone call to the person who signed my contract (30-40 days)\n(d) Letter from my attorney<p>How often have I had to use these? Once. Why so infrequently? Because I follow points 1, 2, and 3 with new clients.",1353574441

Django and Python are in a weird stage right now, add in the fact I don't have any development experience and I am lost on how I should get started. I am first year CS student and have been learning Java in class, but I have taught myself Python at the same pace and am more comfortable programming in Python. I have been using 3.xx, not that it is a huge deal for Python, but I am wondering if I should try to use the latest version of Django so I can use the same version of Python I have been using.<p>My main question though is what is the best way to learn Django? I do not have ANY experience with a framework like this, my only experience is Python, HTML, CSS, some Javascript and a little bit of jQuery. Many people say just to use the documentary online, and I feel this would be good if I had some kind of development background. I am really looking for a book to purchase that is focused towards teaching the basics inside and out. From there I can start to hack stuff together and go off on my own, that is just the way I learn. So if you guys would suggest a book, what would it be? Otherwise what other options should I consider?",1353573342

I can bet that most home users that use Office do not have a license for it - I've seen this happening with small to medium businesses too in my country at least.<p>And for a small to medium business, what makes more sense? Shelling out the cash for Office licenses or going with a completely free and legal alternative? Considering most such businesses don't actually need Exchange integration or other niceties that MS Office provides, the choice is pretty obvious under the threat of being caught.<p>And this is the big problem for MS Office - it's an awesome software package, but judging relatively to its upfront cost to home users or small/medium businesses?

If there is no alternative to Google for something as important as indexing the output of human knowledge production... we are in serious trouble.  The library of Alexandria burned and we still have no idea why [0].<p>Google is interested in one thing, getting you to look at ads.  In their defense, well-targeted ads (++efficiency!).  However when given the opportunity they have exploited their leadership position for every commercial advantage and recently to the detriment of search (e.g., I do not care to see what a bunch of ""thought leaders"" in google+ have to say on the topic I'm searching for).  Their support for ""Do Not Track"" is grudging at best. [1]<p>Their business model is approaching that of a virus infecting a host.  They enter an external market and utilize their near monopoly in web search/advertising to drive the value proposition for competitors to near-zero.  And that gives me pause.  It is like Starbucks opening in every local branch of your public library.<p>So, I support DDG and I give them feedback on my own time in the hopes they aren't also inherently out to screw me in the end.

As long as you use floor/ceil/round where appropriate, you get most of the benefits of integer arithmetic, without the type checking (which you lose in a dynamic language anyways).<p>Some people feel strongly against this, but for dynamically typed language I enjoy its simplicity (for static languages, type systems are meant to enforce constraints on types, so multiple number types can be useful). It has done well in [at least] javascript and lua, and while the former is anything but an example in how to design a programming language, IMHO, the latter may be.<p>So no, it wouldn't be a bad idea to make all numbers 64-bit floats. It sounds like you might likely be compiling to javascript, in which case using 64-bit floats will mean you have one less problem to deal with while implementing it.",1353571819

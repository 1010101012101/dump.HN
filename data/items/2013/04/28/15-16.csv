5621654,comment,5619529,5620090,2,0,andreasvc,,,"No I do not think so. What you describe are called mental states, which are transitory; the self is a relatively persistent concept, spanning one's personality, identity, and life experiences. The author is arguing that rather than just suppressing symptoms with medication, an important part of recovery should be to develop a new self-image that includes the disorder. The medication doesn't help in this regard, but apart from that there are the things one did during episodes which can be very hard to rhyme with one's previous self-image.<p>tokenaudult's point of other cultures not having such a focus on the notion of the self is very interesting; it seems to completely undermine the idea that the self is key to recovery. It is very typical that stories about mental health end with some suggestion that is going to solve it all, but to me it's clear we are simply stumbling through the dark.",1367164763

However, there are at least two ways to verify the date:<p>1)  Verify the half-life value.  Radiometric dating works on the same principle: look at the ratio of pre-substance to fissioned substance.  If you have a good half-life value, you can determine the age of the specimen using those values.<p>2) Use two different methods for getting the same age.  If you use multiple, independent methods of determining the age of something, and they all come out the same, you have greatly lessened the probability that you're wrong or missed something.<p>Of course there are ways that these can be strengthened even more using practices like double blinding the measurements.",1367164690

5621649,comment,5618997,5620146,1,0,summerdown2,,,"The thing is, I think you could be right AND there might be an interesting conversation to be had about Amanda Palmer's business model.<p>There does seem to be a thing on the internet where women who divert from the norm get cut down much more viciously than a man would. I think this might be an interesting conversation to have and I've no idea what the fix might be other than time and generational change (which I think is coming).<p>However, I think there is also a discussion to be had about how we fund the digital age, because it really isn't clear how artists will get paid in future. And a lot of the attempts so far do look like begging.<p>My own view is that there is something awkward in the use of unpaid labour as a business model, but I'm not sure what else can be done. Eventually, the internet looks like it will trend towards to free access for everyone to all media at all times.<p>My personal lack of comfort is that all the payment models I've seen so far decouple the product from the person. To some degree I would suggest that in the past we've paid for good product, but in the future we're increasingly asked to pay for a good person. The difficulty is that this favours the extrovert publicists over the quiet artists and I wish there was some way it might look like this latter group had a future, too.",1367164531
5621648,comment,5621481,5621554,1,0,wjnc,,,"Good questions.<p>The complexity is not in the database, which will be tops several hundreds of tables with thousands of rows by hundreds of fields. Peanuts, datawise. All we need is dynamic updating of the tables, rows and fields throughout the system. That's a small hurdle tops (unless we get the scale wrong ;).<p>The computationally intensive part comes from my background. I'd want to run simulations over networks within our database. That easily beats normal computational intensity. But the demonstration of this functionality is key. Of course, lean could suggest making a faux-demonstration, but you still need a basis of functionality in your first product.<p>Code quality is important both for me as a purist (don't laugh, but being crazy for code quality is what I've learned in large firms in the last few years, even as a non-programmer) and for our customers who will demand it because of their markets. Especially if we would want to rapidly expand our codebase (supposing we survive first customer contact), you need quality code to scale.<p>In the basis it's nothing scipy + numpy couldn't handle, but there the OP comes back: how can we know that we make the right choice in terms of business, sustainability, affordability? That <i>I</i> could build fragments in Python says pretty much nothing. Next to that, my database knowledge is zero. So we are still in the blind there.<p>Getting tech-knowledge on board is a good suggestion. But going from 2 to 3 founders is a big step. And who says we are not just moving the problem one step ahead?",1367164516

I hadn't seen the book, so I could only give it a casual mention. If you reach out further in advance and allow people to review it, you can get better mentions, not just in newsletters but on people's blogs and sites like RubyFlow, etc. This will increase conversions a lot.<p>When you finish the book, definitely hit me up.

5621638,comment,5621040,5621251,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"One of the major problems with specifically web-based television and movies is that they just aren't delivering the revenue that conventional media can, by a huge margin. One of the reasons why such projects are possible at all today is that the creators call in a lot of favors from their friends (actors, editors, techs, etc.) and get them to work at minimal rates. But that's not a very sustainable model.<p>Perhaps with crowd funding projects that then release in more conventional ways (e.g. DVD, netflix, etc.) it'll be possible to solve both ends of this problem. It'll be interesting to see how everything works out.<p>Anyway, I've been surprised at the absence of anyone trying to either coopt the popularity of web video and such-like or to try to make money on it as a business partner. For example, why isn't there a production studio which concentrates on crowd funded movies? It took Zach Braff seeing the popularity of the Veronica Mars kickstarter to have the idea to do the same thing, imagine if there was a group out there catering to artists with projects they want to fund. Apply a little bit of polish, experience with how to formulate a good kickstarter campaign, select reward levels appropriately, help with fulfillment, help with legal issues, help with distribution, take a cut of the profits.",1367164311
5621637,comment,5620923,5621479,5,0,sbirchall,,,"""Simple criminals"" is a bit of a shoot-from-the-hip oversimplification, I'd say. I wouldn't romanticize ""pirates"" but I do think there is a lot more to them from a social/anthropological standing than you are letting on. A simple google search for more in depth information can lend you hours of fascinating reading about the culture and politics on board a typical pirate ship and I just thought the HN comment cloud should not allow you to write them off so cheaply. Yes, they were criminals, but they were far from simple!

I'd really rather not pay for his emergency care either (and some comments in this thread have suggested the same, that we will save more money by not at all covering people who are at risk), but that's hard to push politically. So we will pay for expensive emergency care, because we don't really have a choice. But we'll be damned if we'll pay for preventive care which doesn't seem urgently necessary.",1367164285

This is much closer to the essence of the Pirate Parties interests than quibbling over whether or not the original pirates were simple criminals.<p>However, since you made that categorical statement, one could in fact more convincingly argue that they were the forerunners of the modern private enterprise and democratic shareholder rights.

But look at the fear and outrage it generated in earlier European society as evidenced in Bach's humorous Coffee Cantata,[2] or in the Middle East where for a time it was made illegal.[4]<p>Perhaps one could argue that opium is worse than coffee, alcohol, or tobacco, and so deserves to be called a ""drug"" and made illegal.  But counter arguments have been made that at least alcohol and tobacco are actually worse, and should be made illegal if any of these substances are.  Alcohol actually has been made illegal in the US in the past and that hasn't worked out so well.[3]<p>And where does all this leave psychedelics, many of which have been shown to be far less harmful than opium, alcohol, and tobacco?  In fact, many studies have shown the benefit of psychedelics when used constructively for therapeutic purposes.[5]  There's also a long history of psychedelic and other currently illegal substance use in religious ritual, and of the belief that these substances are sacred.<p>Should people go to jail for helping themselves and others, for peacefully practicing their religion, or for seeking to expand their minds and awareness through these substances?  Should these substances be called ""drugs"", ""sacraments"", or ""tools""?<p>Advocates of the so-called ""war on drugs"" often will not accept or even acknowledge the possibility of constructive, positive currently illegal substance use.  They tend to smear all such use as drug abuse.<p>Yet much of what society values: music, art, literature, religion, technology, science, and medicine has been positively influenced by currently illegal substance use.<p>To take one relatively uncontroversial example: odds are that much of the music that most readers of this post listen to every day was inspired directly or indirectly by these substances.  It might not say that on the album cover, but dig in to it a bit and you'll see that either the musicians who made the music themselves used these substances to inspire their music, or the musicians who strongly influenced them did.  The same goes for a lot of art and literature.  This leads to another important point:  much of the good that currently illegal substances do is unacknowledged because there's a stigma against admitting that you use or approve of them.<p>If you look at the history of mind-altering substance use and the reaction of socieites to these substances, a clear pattern emerges where it is usually new mind-altering substances that are feared and made illegal, while mind-altering substances that have had a long history of use in that society are tolerated or even considered sacred (as in the wine drunk during Catholic rituals, or coffee's use by Sufi mystics[4]).<p>Another feature of drug prohibition is that there are often religious, moralistic and puritanical aspects to reactions against certain substances.  Some altered states of consciousness achievable through the use of these substances are considered to be ""impure"" or ""derranged"" in some way, and their users are considered immoral, depraved or wicked.  Anti-drug crusaders often adopt a moralistic, ""holier than thou"" attitude towards users.<p>Racism and xenophobia are other common features of the drug war.  Substances which minorities choose to use (like crack used in black ghettoes) are stigmatized, while substances which the dominant majority chooses to use (like cocaine use in white suburbs or on Wall St) are effectively tolerated.<p>Political opportunism plays a huge role, as does the eagerness of politicians to appear like they're being ""tough on crime"".<p>Finally, there's the economic aspect -- where the prison industry, police, lawyers, judges, and the Drug Enforcement Agency benefit from arrests, imprisonments, and asset forfeitures.  The alcohol and tobacco industries, and arguably the pharmaceutical industry also stands to benefit from keeping certain substances illegal.<p>[1] - Just one example of many: ""c. 1650 The use of tobacco is prohibited in Bavaria, Saxony, and Zurich, but the prohibitions are ineffective. Sultan Murad IV of the Ottoman Empire decrees the death penalty for smoking tobacco: ""Wherever the Sultan went on his travels or on a military expedition his halting-places were always distinguished by a terrible increase in the number of executions. Even on the battlefield he was fond of surprising men in the act of smoking, when he would punish them by beheading, hanging, quartering, or crushing their hands and feet . . . . Nevertheless, in spite of all the horrors of this persecution . . . the passion for smoking still persisted.'"" - <a href=""http://www.trivia-library.com/a/history-of-legal-and-illegal-drugs-from-1500-to-1700-ad.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trivia-library.com/a/history-of-legal-and-illegal...</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_Cantata"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_Cantata</a><p>[3] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition</a><p>[4] - <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22190802"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22190802</a><p>[5] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_therapy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_therapy</a>",1367163050

There's a world of difference between:<p>1. Fishing out your smartphone from your pants/bag/wherever<p>2. Unlocking it (with requisite passcode, thanks corporate IT)<p>3. Bringing up the search app<p>4. And either saying what you want after invoking the voice search (and hoping it comes  up right, or else you get to do it over again) or typing what you want (and hoping you made no mistakes).<p>And:<p>1. Saying, at any time, ""Ok Glass, search for (thing)"", and having the results played back so you can hear them.<p>The first one feels contrived and annoying, the second feels passive and natural in comparison.<p>Glass is unique in that the first two steps of that transaction are eliminated outright, and the third is reduced to saying some magic words. The fourth is greatly mitigated by the fact that Glass is likely in a better position to capture your voice than the speakerphone mic on your smartphone.<p>Passive access to information (and I'm saying access, not overlay, for a good reason) \nis going to be the next big thing for precisely this reason, ease of use!<p>But let's take another example. I'm sure you've seen the posts decrying someone ""missing out"" on some event because they were too busy recording it. Now? That's not a problem anymore. ""Ok Glass, record a video"". You're done. You don't have to think about it, you just launch the recording and then go back to whatever you were doing.<p>Focus? You barely even see Glass unless you're actively looking up at it. Indeed, you need to ""focus"" on it to use it. The transaction is just reduced from messing with your phone to an upwards glance.<p>This is also why I disagree with your assessment of glass as being both an overlay (which it isn't), and noisy (which it isn't, and which would go against the guidelines anyways).<p>I'm finding more and more that people who feel they need to ""disconnect"" are simply failing at technology.

8058876,comment,8058474,8058786,4,0,gabemart,,,"More than just being faster, it establishes short, content-free messages as a socially valid communication method.<p>Snapchat wasn&#x27;t a success because people had been yearning for self-deleting photo messaging or because people found it too complicated to send photo messages with other apps. It was a success because it gave people social permission to send low-pressure, low-expectation photo messages to their friends. Someone who sends a photo of their lunch via Facebook messenger or as an email attachment runs the risk of being seen as silly, superficial or self-involved. Doing the same thing via Snapchat is totally expected, socially-valid and safe behavior, because the medium of Snapchat provides implicit permission to send those types of messages: it&#x27;s only around for a few seconds, so who cares if it&#x27;s a bit trivial or silly?<p>The medium of Yo provides the same kind of implicit validation. You don&#x27;t have to worry about seeming blunt or disturbing someone or failing to consider the other person&#x27;s needs, because the format itself makes catering to those worries impossible. So the unique feature of the app isn&#x27;t the functionality it provides but the narrow and unequivocal use of that functionality that it mandates.<p>The trend of communication is towards the shortest, least-demanding formats possible. The first big blogging sites were popular not just because they were easier to use than hand-written HTML or complex CMS&#x27;s, but because they validated personal blogging as a format. Facebook made &quot;blogging&quot; even more personal, trivial and self-focused. Twitter then made communication even less demanding by establishing a format in which it is impossible to create serious and thoughtful content, thus removing the pressure to do so. Snapchat made messaging even more ephemeral and low-pressure. And now Yo removes even the expectation of taking a picture that&#x27;s funny or interesting, even for just a few seconds.<p>It seems like what people want are formats that allow them to connect with others and express themselves while simultaneously removing as much pressure to perform or possibility of critique as possible.",1405806778

Their prices are very fair, they have great staff, and they have a system that lets you preview your recovered data before paying anything. We got a new business client entirely because his RAID 1 NAS pooped itself and Gillware was able to recover everything he needed from it.<p>If you&#x27;ve got a lot of data, online backup services are usually not an option. My usual advice then is to have a completely separate device that automatically pulls data from your primary device and stores backups in an archival format. If you have the time and inclination to do the setup on it, I really recommend BackupPC for this: <a href=""http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/</a>. I&#x27;ve used BackupPC for years for larger-scale backups; it&#x27;s very reliable, it&#x27;s not too difficult to get going, it does deduplication and compression and pooling and uses rsync (when possible) to reduce network load, it can easily be configured to send you an email in the event of trouble, and it has a simple web interface you can check into on a regular basis. I&#x27;ve yet to find a commercial shrink-wrapped product that does what BackupPC does as well as BackupPC does it.<p>The downside of course is that you still wouldn&#x27;t have offsite backups, so in the event of a fire or other local disaster, you might still be looking at complete data loss. If at all possible, try to pick a few of the most important directories of files, and get those backed up online.

I had a turbo-XT back in the day, so parts 1 and 2 really bring you back if you were of that age.<p>Part 3:<p>&quot;Running C code is a bit more difficult. The problem is that the code generated by any standard C compiler for the x86 CPU will heavily depend on RAM. System RAM is not enabled yet and the code to enable it is so complex that you really want to do it in C. Two solutions have been devised and both of these are in use (one or the other depending on the hardware).<p>Use a special C compiler (romcc) that does not make use of RAM, but keeps all data in registers. As the register set of the x86 is quite small (only 8 general purpose 32-bit registers), this severely limits the things that your C program can do. As the CALL and RET instructions cannot be used (they always use the stack in RAM), all C functions have to be inlined.\nUse the CPU cache as a data RAM. This requires some special tricks to pretend that all cache lines contain valid data and to prevent them from being evicted. Which tricks are exactly required, depends on the exact model of CPU, but it can be done. The Cache As RAM trick (CAR) yields at least 16kB of usable RAM, sufficient as stack space for a simple C program. All recent hardware ports use this trick.&quot;<p>Mind.  Blown.",1405805526

Employers need to be able to demonstrate that they&#x27;re not paying H1Bs less, or there is hell to pay.  These audits aren&#x27;t rare either -- by the time you&#x27;re large enough to have decent number of H1Bs they&#x27;re practically routine.  Large companies have a team of people just focusing on H1B compliance.<p>As you discovered, there is a hidden wage pressure anyway.  Over your career, it&#x27;s your mobility that helps drive your wages up: either because you leave for greener fields, or just because you can.  While you&#x27;re on a H1B your mobility is so limited which can put your career in low gear until you get your GC.  If your on lame project or a cheap company you just have to put up with it.<p>The dumb thing is that the solution is absurdly simple: just allow H1Bs to transfer sponsorship with zero penalty.  If that means that they work for 5 different firms before they get the GC, so be it.  Labor market dynamism is a <i>good</i> thing, embrace it.  You also could scrap the whole auditing process; if a company starts underpaying their H1B&#x27;s the problem would sort itself out very quickly as they start getting poached by the competitor down the road.",1405804481

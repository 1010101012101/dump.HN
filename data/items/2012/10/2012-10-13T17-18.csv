I think this author sells a story of how they got rich and how you also can get rich (and how you can do this easily) It's a common scheme and I think the only people that are getting rich by this are the people that are selling this kind of knowledge.<p>The problem (at least based on my experience) is that building anything successful takes a huge amounts of dedication and effort -- there's also a large margin for failure. It's simply not something that's easy to reproduce and you probably won't make five-figures a month by selling things to a mailing list. Or create a 30x500 product and instantly be your own boss. And sure, there are some that are going to succeed at this (and great for them!), but presenting this like anybody will get rich by just following a scheme rings off alarm clocks, especially when this kind of knowledge is sold at a high cost.",1350151161

Yeah, real solid source. Definitely grounds to ruin someone's life.<p>Also, since when is that a crime? Or even immoral? It <i>could</i> be a massive breach of trust and immoral, depending on the situation. However depending on the relationship between wife, daughter and the guy, it could be just regular cheating. Or not even that.<p>He didn't rape his stepdaughter, or coerce his daughter, or have consensual sex with his underage stepdaughter. What he did was have consensual sex with a grown woman he has no blood relation to and for all you know has no parental relationship with either.<p>Hardly the ""case closed"" indictment you want it to be, even if it allows you to string together the words ""sex"" and ""daughter"" in the same sentence to elicit a knee-jerk negative response.",1350151114

If our company unilaterally allowed everyone to take 5 weeks vacation, the revenue would not fall 5% based on the lost productivity.  It might fall 20 or 30% or more, because we would lose market share to our competitors, and we are fighting in a winner-takes-all market.  But if all companies in our market had to offer 5 weeks vacation, and this was enforced, then we would all be on the same footing, and all would be better off.

Have you ever independently falsified my belief yourself, personally? No? Then you have failed to meet your burden of evidence and Bigfoot really does exist.<p>What is wrong with the above claim? Apart from unfairly shifting the burden of evidence, the problem is that it contradicts the central posture of science toward evidence -- the <i>null hypothesis</i>, the precept that an idea is <i>assumed to be false in the absence of positive evidence</i>.<p>Using the null hypothesis as a logical basis, Grof's claims have no meaning until they are supported by positive scientific evidence (not merely the absence of contradicting evidence).<p>Without the null hypothesis, anything anyone cares to assert is accepted as true. I say that Bigfoot exists, and because you cannot disprove my claim by looking under every rock in the universe, my claim is true. The problem with my claim and posture is that disproof would require <i>proof of a negative</i>, an impossible evidentiary burden, for reasons given here:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russells_teapot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russells_teapot</a><p>A quote: ""Russell's teapot, sometimes called the celestial teapot or cosmic teapot, is an analogy first coined by the philosopher Bertrand Russell (18721970) to illustrate that the philosophic burden of proof lies upon a person making scientifically unfalsifiable claims rather than shifting the burden of proof to others ...""<p>> I guess you missed the part where Grof said he was a materialist monoist Freudian prior to the use of therapeutic LSD in his practice.<p>Oh, well, that makes it all right then. I'm glad you cleared that up.<p>Meanwhile, on Planet Earth, to assert the central role of astrology in human affairs <i>requires evidence</i>.<p>> It was experiential evidence ...<p>""Experiential evidence"" is not evidence, it is anecdote. Calling this ""experiential evidence"" is to string together terms that contradict each other.<p>> ... that caused Grof to revise his views of the world - what makes you change your mind?<p>The other kind of evidence -- the real kind. The kind of evidence on which two or more independent, dispassionate observers can agree. The kind of evidence that favors vaccines over dried gourds and witch doctors. The kind of evidence that dispassionately falsifies racism and sexism. The kind of evidence that keeps Creationism out of public classrooms.<p>Science is not merely a set of rules for identifying and processing evidence, for crafting and testing theories. It is also a way to undermine some really stupid ideas that appear spontaneously from time to time. Ideas like astrology.",1350150681

That is why joining people who are building something similar ends up being a good option for them. They might not get the same financial benefit, but they may get other intangible benefits from it (pride, sense of accomplushment, experience).<p>Saying that joining a marketing person or hiring one is not the recipe for building a business.

4649126,comment,4648597,4649049,8,0,larrys,,,"I think there is a key difference between appointment reminder and the two other things (consulting and the course).<p>AR is something that will provide residuals that will continue for quite some time. During that time you will have to improve the product (at your leisure) and basically keep the infrastructure running. In return you will collect $29 to $199 per month, every month. No need to resell those that are already paying you money. You just have to keep them happy. Although I have some issues with the price points you have chosen (I know you have probably blogged about this and know much about it I would have taken a different strategy) leaving that aside for now I see the other things you are doing as simply distractions (as you realized) from spending time on the thing that will pay off long term.<p>I had an opportunity, way way back, to get in on the ground floor of the PC business but didn't have the capital. Instead of getting others involved I started another business to earn money which I sold profitably after 10 years but it was no way as successful as fulfilling the thing that I started out would have been. It was just a distraction. You stand the chance at getting sucked into the ""success"" of the consulting and the courses because they are making you money. And what will happen is that instead of creating things with residuals (like AR) you will constantly have to work to keep that up with new ideas and materials. Rather than just being able to have a residual business, which, from my opinion and experience, is much better. My advice is therefore to bite the bullet and take money from others that will allow you to grow the SAAS (and then create other SAAS).<p>My quick idea would be to setup a network of college students to sell the white label version walking literally door to door in office parks signing up professionals (doctors dentists) to use this product by giving them 3 months for free or something  like that.",1350150458

It's proponents believe that they can create a reverse social hierarchy by convincing those supposedly at the top (straight while males) that every aspect of their lives benefits from a social advantage they don't know they have. Thus straight white males are encouraged to live in a constant state of paranoia and shame essentially for being born. For those who accept this belief system, the only way to achieve harmony with those around you is to actively ""give away your privilege"" which is to say sabotage and undermine your own potential and achievements so that other, less privileged persons may somehow benefit. How this should be done is typically left unclear. As with most ""social justice"" belief systems the point is to spread guilt and shame.

4649107,comment,4648275,4648544,3,0,d0mine,,,"GIL or no GIL, threads run concurrently in Python.  The difference might be in performance:<p><pre><code>  - IO-bound tasks: GIL is released
  - CPU-bound tasks on N-core on a single host. To exploit multiple CPUs: 

     a) no GIL (hypothetical): N times speed up (optimistically)
         (it suggests weak data dependency i.e., 
          multiprocessing can be used to the same effect)

     b) option a) with multiple processes (shared memory or communication-based approach)
         Code complexity is the same on average (except on Windows)

     c) C extensions (existing or new): speed up 10*N or more on numerical code
         Cython makes it easy to write new extensions.
         Currently due to dynamic nature of Python, GIL or no GIL, 
         C extensions might be necessary to exploit hardware fully
         (though C extensions might not be an option in some projects)

  - scalable to multiple hosts tasks: different processes i.e., GIL is not a problem
</code></pre>
Benefits of GIL:<p><pre><code>  - C extensions (and the interpreter) are simpler to write correctly. 
     Multithreaded programming is not trivial we need all the help we can get.
  - no performance penalty for single-threaded code
  - it encourages a synchronization through communication concurrent model (builtin in Go)
</code></pre>
Disadvantages:<p><pre><code>  - some applications have no localized performance bottlenecks. 
    So writing a small C extension won't help to get possible 
    performance benefits of running on multicore in parallel.
    If performance is critical; Python might not be the right tool in this case
  - there are pathological cases when performance suffers greatly due to GIL
    (though other approaches would have their own pathological cases)
  - a (non-informed) perception that Python can't benefit from multicore</code></pre>",1350149916

While I think in retrospect Elop made a few bad calls, when he got there MeeGo was <i>not</i> in production-quality shape. Nokia's own assessment was that they would have <i>one</i> MeeGo unit ready for shipping in 2011, and that particular unit--what eventually came out quietly as the N9--was an intriguing but crashably unusable demo unit even in late 2010. This isn't speculation on my part, either: I was at Nokia in 2010 and used one of them briefly. Or tried to. There was a lot of stuff that just didn't work. In November 2010. On the only device that was far enough along to have hardware that could be shown to other groups.<p>And Symbian? Jesus. To implement a ""search as you go"" feature for Symbian^3, something that would narrow down search results both on the phone and off as you typed (like iOS and Android devices do, so this was just achieving parity), we had to <i>write our own keyboard</i> because the Symbian keyboard <i>took over the whole screen.</i> You selected a text field and got the keyboard, then hit the keyboard dismiss button to see the screen again. But look on the bright side: in addition to the ""Universal Search"" team in San Francisco working on that, there were <i>four other groups</i> around Nokia, both employees and contractors, working on what was, essentially, the exact. Same. Product.<p>And this was de rigueur for Nokia. <i>This</i> was the problem that Elop had to fix beyond anything technical: massive duplicated effort on what, at any other company, were already solved problems, because Nokia had become a bunch of fiefdoms all fiercely protecting their own turf. I'm pretty sure this is <i>why</i> Symbian stuck around in essentially the same form for so long. I'm sure Tomi Ahonen loved it as a user, but the number of engineers working on Symbian who <i>liked</i> working on it that I talked to was, to the best of my recollection, zero. (Just getting the developer toolchain running on my machine made me feel like I'd time traveled back to the days of SLS Linux.)<p>If I ran the zoo, I'd have probably gone with Android rather than Windows Phone; Elop went the other way not because of his past connections with Microsoft, but because he wanted to keep using lucrative Nokia services (rather than Google counterparts, most notably Maps) <i>and</i> be allowed to use the Android branding, and Google said no. I wouldn't have cared about the Android branding--instead I'd have cared about porting Qt to Android and not burning bridges with Nokia's existing development community. They'd just spent a lot of time, money and effort convincing everyone that Qt was the Way Of The Future: instead of writing to Symbian <i>or</i> MeeGo APIs, you'd write to Qt APIs, and then porting would be simple. Losing that was a bad call.<p>But I'd say the most serious mistake Elop made had nothing to do with technology. Love Apple or hate them, one of the things they're really good at is not talking about products before they're ready. The rumor mill may be in high gear for months, sure, but when Apple makes their official announcement, it is nearly <i>always</i> in the form of ""Here is our new Superlative Magical Thing. Here is a video of Jony Ive talking earnestly about it. It will be available for this price (two weeks from now|tomorrow|as soon as the band stops playing)."" If Elop had been running Apple during the PowerPC-Intel CPU switch, he'd have leaked an internal memo describing the PowerPC in some colorful apocalypse-invoking metaphor, then three months later <i>announce</i> the switch, then six months after <i>that</i> introduce one laptop with an Intel chip that wasn't the most current generation and say they'd have more coming next year.<p>The lesson to draw from Nokia under Elop isn't that they should have stuck with MeeGo; it's that they should have kept their mouth shut, kept shipping Symbian phones through 2011, and started 2012 with their new devices <i>ready to ship</i> when they announced them. I wouldn't be surprised if Ahonen gets his wish within a year and Elop <i>is</i> canned by Nokia's board -- but I'd be very surprised if doing so improves their situation.",1350149795

Appointment Reminder, the SaaS which I <i>wish</i> was the center of gravity of my business at the moment, is profitable but not profitable enough to hire the folks and buy the things that I want to accelerate growth of it.<p>So I have been supporting it by consulting, but when I'm consulting I'm not selling Appointment Reminder accounts, and consulting is <i>always</i> more distracting than I expect it to be.  (You think I would realize this after two years of it, but I persistently underestimate how much time it takes to e.g. prospect for new clients, negotiate/schedule engagements, travel to them, and deal with follow-up stuff like invoices.)<p>The traditional option for scaling a software business with a working product and actual customers is to take investment, but that's another ball of wax.  There's fairly attractive options in angel investing these days, but taking any outside money would have an outsized effect on the character of my business at the moment, and I'm not ready to pull that trigger yet.  Also, like consulting, raising an investment round is a <i>very</i> distracting event -- it basically commits you to months of doing near no productive work.  (And unlike consulting, taking investment causes time debt which is <i>impossible</i> to discharge until you exit your business: you're now committed to keeping those investors happy and in the loop for, well, forever in business terms.)<p>But, having seen a lot of smart software companies do side projects (37signals was a big fan of it, and Amy Hoy and company have quite a bit of success) I decided to try my hand at it once and see how it went.  So I started packaging one of my most-commonly-a-win consulting offerings as an online course, and decided to experiment with it once.  (And, like Brennan says and like everybody in the space will tell you, I started by making an email list and sending them lots of free stuff they enjoyed which further burnished my credibility on the subject.)<p>The experiment was very successful: my customers seem to have liked what I produced, many of them have actually used it to positive effect in their business, and it raised a significant amount of money.  (I'll probably blog in detail about it later).<p>An unanticipated side effect was, because of the topic I picked for my video course, I actually sat down and took all my own advice for a change (AR had an email strategy which I would have never let fly at a consulting client simply because I shipped the minimum necessary and never revisited that decision), and that ended up working out very well.<p>So, basically, yes: confirmation from someone else, this does work and it is perfectly compatible with running a software business.",1350148412

More controversial examples than that, though, and you'd see a bunch of people arguing it's not Really Sexism(tm).<p>To prove the point, here's some actual struggles against sexism. Racism will have to wait for another day.<p>1) Rape culture. A large proportion of women are the objects of nonconsensual sexual encounters. People make excuses for this, saying that it was not ""legitimate rape"" or arguing that lots of women ""rape easy."" Note that this isn't a super odd or rare occurrence pushed by hillbilly conservative legislators but happens in the highest seats of power, from candidates on the Presidential ticket trying to pass legislation only providing protections for ""forcible rape"" to the New York Times saying a gang-raped 11 year old child was sort of asking for it.<p>2) Access to healthcare. Many women are not covered for even the most basic protections. In some areas, a hospital is allowed to refuse access to abortions for women who have been raped or are victims of incest. While men have for ages been given insurance coverage for Viagra and baldness treatments, it was only recently that it was mandated that women should get coverage for birth control, to much wailing and gnashing of teeth. Probably worse of all, it's become incredibly difficult in many areas to get even a first trimester abortion. Those legislators banning abortion, I'll point out, are the same ones minimizing rape and opposing laws that enforce against gender discrimination in the workplace.<p>3) The glass ceiling and sexism in the workplace. Yes, they're real, and just because it's a bit more subtle than disallowing women to own property or making it legally impossible for a husband to be subject to legal penalties for raping his wife (which in the USA only ended in 1993) doesn't mean that they're not sexism.<p>4) Sexism in the home. People love to point out that women are more likely to have jobs than men now and more likely to have a degree, sometimes in an attempt to say ""well aren't men the oppressed ones now?"" But on top of those responsibilities, women still do a disproportionate amount of the housework in opposite-sex coupled homes. You might laugh and say ""well what's 15 minutes of work extra a day, it's nothing compared to not being able to own property"" but that kind of thing is deeply pernicious.<p>I'm sure you can also point out places where men are screwed by sexism in our society. And you know what? Those suck too, and everyone should oppose them just as much as sexism against women.",1350148063

4649014,comment,4648625,4648625,2,0,sophacles,,,"There is a lot of weird cognitive dissonance in this article. ""Special protection"" is one of those vague phrases that can (and appears to be here) used in a few different ways.[1] In some senses it is taken to mean ""elevating one group to have a higher privilege set and stronger boundary enforcement than the norm"". In other senses it is used as ""stripping unfair privilege from one group by a combination of positively asserting the rights for the protected group and punishment for those who deny those rights or assert a privilege for their group"".[2]<p>This fuzzy, conflicting set of understandings leads to a lot of cases of people talking past each other, and not really accomplishing anything. We really need to stop using such terms in discussion and be a bit more specific. There are good and bad examples of both meanings, and there needs to be frank and open discussion, without reduction to overloaded and emotionally loaded terms.<p>Similarly there is the problem of privilege blindness. Even if <i>I</i> treat everyone the same, or think I do, I may not be. This is a real thing - people have notions of the right way to treat someone and they don't even notice that it is absurd or privilege enforcing. For example: In college and for a short time after, I worked at a bar as a bartender. My boss was a black man, the owner of the business. I am a white guy, 10 years younger. People would come in during closed hours with deliveries or job applications or sales pitches and come to me first. I honestly didn't notice or think anything of it most of the time, even when it was obvious when he was in charge (e.g. i was mopping and he was counting out drawers). I would write it off as ""oh they just don't want to interrupt the boss"" or other reasonable sounding explanations.<p>One day right before we started accepting a round of applications, he mentioned this to me and I was a bit resistant to the idea that it was racial. I offered the reasonable sounding thoughts and explanations. So we did an experiment. Half the days I would do grunt work and he would do boss work, the other half the days I would do boss work and he would do grunt work. In both cases, a significant portion of the applicants came to me first[3]. Surprisingly, all groups of applicants (divided by gender, race,etc) displayed this behavior. This is a case of privilege that is really difficult to see if you think everyone is treated equally or think you do too. I seriously doubt the applicants were racist (well most of them weren't), and I presume they truly believed in equality and that they actively wanted to treat everyone the same (evidence: how embarrassed they were when I pointed out who the actual boss was). The privilege I had here, by being white, was that the default assumption is that I was in charge.[3]<p>The point here is that sometimes, despite the best intentions, there are societal/cultural assumptions that are ingrained to the point of invisibility for those who are the norm. It is important to point these out and discuss them, so that people can actively stop doing participating. I believe most people don't want to be (.<i>)ist, but also that the just don't know when their actions are conforming to it unintentionally.<p>I think that one thing this article is great for, is highlighting that.  The author obviously cares that everyone is treated well and equally. It would be insulting to point out to him any of his actions as sexist, because he really isn't.[4] Instead the better approach is to have discussions, which are inherently uncomfortable, in the light of ""here's a privilege or default assumption that exists, here is evidence"", and get the people with the privilege to see it as existing at all. Once that happens, they will stop asserting it on their own, because the don't want to be unfair or unequal or whatever.<p></unintentionally ranty post><p>[1] Please note, that my definitions after this footnote are my understanding of the scenario, if this is inaccurate please link me to sources with good explanations!<p>[2] There is another commonly used understanding of this term, which is as a code word for ""I am about to say something that really is about protecting my privileges"", however I don't think the author meant this here.<p>[3] Later, after learning about various equality issues in a more formal way, there were even more things that pointed out the privilege in this situation... my boss was someone who could ""pass"" as white, I'm a guy who dresses down and is generally scruffy, and so on. There is also a related bit of privilege in this situation from when I was hired. My friend who hooked me up with the lead and a good recommendation made sure to casually point out that the owner was a black man. This priming was something that at the time I thought nothing of, it was a bit of conversation about the environment, but in retrospect, I probably would have made the mistake I described above without that priming. No one ever casually mentions that the boss is white when describing a job to a prospect.<p>[4] (.</i>)ism implies the person actively wants to keep the targeted group in a state of lower privilege. It is insulting to be called that when you actually want the opposite.",1350147781

All businesses need growth. So execution and growth aren't defining characteristics of a startup.",1350147704

As a gay man, I know I can mention the gender of my spouse (male!) in a workplace environment without being worried about being fired (say). Straight people have always (more or less) been able to mention their spouse in the workplace without fear of repercussion. Now I can too! Political Correctness means I don't have to watch every word I say in the office! It's done wonders for my freedom of speech.",1350147639

Marketing is just storytelling, and when your story aligns with the needs of someone else, a transaction occurs.<p>Honestly, if you want to just write code all day (and there's nothing wrong with that) don't create a product - work for somebody else.",1350147620

This is the smaller part, and the sole that you can address with a campaign.<p>My point of view is focused on the sexism that is NOT blatant and obvious like that. Examples:<p>1) The male boss promotes a male instead of a woman not based solely on merits but for prejudice about the capabilities of women.<p>2) The male boss promotes a prettier woman worker even if another woman deserved it more.<p>3) The female boss promotes a male because she feels (without possibly fully understanding it) in competition with the pretty woman even if she deserved it more.<p>There are a shitload of cases like this, and this is the <i>whole</i> point, because the bad jokes can be addressed directly: they may be unpleasant, but there is an easy path to fight this behaviours. Instead the more subtle things that prevent a carrier from having the same chances of everybody else is where I would be more focused. And this stuff is not the one you can fight with being politically correct.",1350147616

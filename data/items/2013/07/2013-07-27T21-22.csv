I&#x27;m an iPhone user, and recently on a two day trip I took my dad&#x27;s S4 with me and used it as my sole device.<p>Oh. My. God.<p>The difference in user experience is <i>astronomical</i>. I work in the tech industry and I <i>train</i> users on how to use my company&#x27;s software, and I could not for the life of me wrap my mind around some of the most basic aspects of the phone. Most functions, from scrolling and animations to simple things like changing the focus from a text box on the web page to the URL bar of the browser, had <i>noticeable</i> lag. Sometimes the lag was so atrocious that I could not be sure if my taps worked. Occasionally I would get impatient and tap again, and it would register two taps simultaneously and treat it as a double-tap! You are absolutely right that it felt like using a regular computer - and old and slow one. I couldn&#x27;t deal with it.<p>At one point I was checking my work email and had to access a voicemail that arrived as an attachment. I clicked it, and instead of playing the voicemail right away (which the iPhone does), the S4 <i>downloaded it as a file.</i> Okay, fine, I get it, you want to pretend you&#x27;re a computer. But where the hell did it go? Is there a separate browser area for downloaded items like in Chrome? Is there a desktop, or some kind of folder? And if you&#x27;re pretending to be a computer, am I going to need special software to be able to open this file? Are you really going to make me open another tab and Google &quot;how to find downloaded files on Android&quot;?!? WHY ARE YOU MAKING ME THINK? <i>WHY ARE SIMPLE THINGS NOT OBVIOUS LIKE THEY ARE ON IOS?</i><p>In my experience, people are drawn to Android don&#x27;t care much about user experience and instead want larger screens and tons of features. Personally, I view my smartphone the way I view my car: I want one that is easy to drive, responsive and won&#x27;t lag for ~2 seconds every time I do something.",1374962395

You know what&#x27;s the real problem?

Those that read this site are those most likely to be culled.<p>Anyway silly question. If the bacterias are so well at adapting to antibiotics, can&#x27;t we create some kind of mold that can adapt to the bacteria?

Ill try explain the other side.<p>I will avoid the fact that a 90% winrate in a format like you describe (heads up sit and go) is not even remotely possible vs anyone who knows the basic rules. In heads up sit and goes 2-5% roi is generally considered great at any non micro level. Poker (especially online) is more of a volume game. However, roi is very flawed which I will get to. Generally the most profitable players are ones who crank out a small winrate over large amounts of volume.<p>Here is the problem though, we really are not concerned with winning a single game in a format like this. Our top concern is making money. In a winner take all heads up tournament chipEV == $EV so we can just call it EV in this format and not worry about ICM. If we are playing for a living we want to make the most amount of money, so each session we want to maximize our EV (win the most amount of chips). Most internet players worry about their winrate in BB/100 or EV adjusted $/hr.<p>When we get into a situation which we are a 1% favorite for full stacks vs a player we have a large edge on, we should still take it, its money in our pocket long term. If we lose we pray the opponent accepts a rematch. This is especially true for heads up games which usually only last a few minutes and its possible to play 100-200 games per day. A 3% winrate at $100 stakes with this volume becomes a significant amount of money even before factoring in site bonuses (likely a bit over $1/game) etc.<p>Not related to your comment, but doesn&#x27;t deserve another post is that poker really is a great game and its unfortunate how its perceived by so many. Ive been playing for 3 years professionally and coached on a popular training site, yet after transitioning to programming (With a cs degree) I get laughed at by recruiters and seen as a degenerate.",1374960984

It&#x27;s possible to have much more profound experiences (both positive and negative) than what was described in this article.<p>I can recommend a book called <i>&quot;The Varieties of Psychedelic Experience&quot;</i> for a more comprehensive look at some of the possibilities.  Also, see the trip reports on erowid.org.<p>Psychedelics may be best for people who are naturally inquisitive, like seeing things from novel perspectives and walking in other people&#x27;s shoes, are comfortable with encountering material from their subconscious, and who enjoy questioning themselves and the world around them.<p>People who are very set in their ways and who think they&#x27;ve got the world figured out might be in for a rude awakening when their certainty is pulled out from under their feet.  Then again, maybe that&#x27;s just what some of them need.<p>It&#x27;s great that the author thoroughly educated himself about the effects of the drugs he was about to try, and planned his day.  The world would be much better off if more people did that.<p>I was also very pleased to see that he tried to use his time constructively while tripping.  Way too many people&#x27;s sole aim in taking drugs to &quot;party&quot; or &quot;get fucked up&quot;.  That&#x27;s a complete and utter waste of the potential of these enormously powerful substances, and borders on abuse, IMO.<p>The main thing I was disappointed with was that he didn&#x27;t have an experienced and trusted trip guide or a sitter with him.  That&#x27;s very important, especially for inexperienced users.  Fortunately, his decision to walk around the city by himself turned out fine.  But it might not have.  When tripping, you don&#x27;t always make the wisest choices.  An experienced sitter can help keep you safe.<p>There&#x27;s a really great book called <i>&quot;The Secret Chief Revealed&quot;</i> about a therapist who guided hundreds of trips for his clients.  One of the more interesting techniques that he used during his sessions was to ask his clients to bring a stack of personally significant photographs with them (in particular, photos of family members and loved ones).  Looking at these after the peak of the trip could be incredibly helpful.  That may be something to think about for your next trip.",1374960508

Pardon me, but I won&#x27;t be emulating your example.<p>The focus of Dijkstra&#x27;s research career was how to make correct software.  As he himself would claim, there are two halves to this process.  The first is to limit ourselves to forms of writing code which are easy to reason about.  The second is to actually perform that reasoning.<p>The part of his proposal that actually had an impact is the part which says that we need to focus on methods of expressing ourselves that are easy to reason about.  The part that did not have a direct impact is the part which says that we need to perform that formal reasoning.  The fundamental reason why not is that Dijkstra&#x27;s reasoning assumed the existence of a consistent, unchanging specification.  The real world does not work that way - computers exist to do what humans ask.  And humans do not always ask for things that make sense.<p>This is not to say that this is the impact that he wanted to have - it is clearly not - but it is the impact that he did have.<p>However some of his other ideas have indeed found their way into practice, albeit in a muted way that he would have objected to.  For example take unit tests, since you brought them up.  He was against tests as part of including QA as an integral part of the programming process - if the programmer performed properly then that should not be needed.  (Nice theory, fails in practice.)  However today, well-designed unit tests do serve as a limited form of specifying exactly what a given piece of code is supposed to do, and verifying that it in fact does that.  (I&#x27;m sure that he would say limited and inadequate.  But it is better than nothing.)",1374960472

It depends on how you mother did eat before and when she was pregnant (e.g. Dutch hunter winter children), and how you diet was when you was young. The highest likelyhood of being fat is if you are from a foreign family that lived healthy but on low calories, and moved to a country where lots of cheap fast food is available. Women have a good chance to change weight everytime they are pregnant, and at the menopause. Unfortunately most women will gain weight at that point. Men do not have those easy opportunities at times of hormonal changes. So if one loses weight by hunger, the body will bounce back to its epigenetic fixed weight again, once you stop being hungry.<p>So lets accept weight, and focus on fitness for fun itself.<p>Imho, the best sport for fat people is sailing. Every crew needs fat sailors as self loading ballast at the rail. Sailing is sport that is fun, even for the heavy weight.Its a sport that does not give you the painful feeling of being a loser, but its fun to be an important member of a crew. You think you just sit there, and move your ass once every tack or jibe, but in fact you move all the time constantly balancing against the rolling of the boat. You burn a lot of calories that way. You get a positive feedback, and time by time you become fit, even if you only lose a few pounds fat and gain a few pounds muscles.<p>I do not have a overweight problem myself, even vice versa. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;10&quot;/178cm with 120lbs/54kg in summer, and 128lbs/58kg in winter. But I have a neighbor, who did lose 15kg/30lbs just by sailing, and by getting in a positive fitness loop. She moves more now, e.g. shopping by walking instead of shopping by car, as she is able to move without burden. She still weights 30kg/60lbs more then me, but thats ok. She is fit, even if she is still a bit round, because the rounds are now at the right places. She does no longer look like an ugly fat women mid 40s, but like a chubby smiling woman who is happy with her body.<p>PS: You do not need to own a boat to become a sailor.

Furthermore, Samsung overtook Apple in its weakest quarter (not for the whole year), as people hold off iPhone purchases as they await the unveiling of the newest iPhone model.  Finally, Samsung&#x27;s number includes sales from non-smartphones.  The story is mostly still the same:  Samsung is making progress in attacking the high end, but most of their profits come from selling cheaper, lower quality phones to a wider audience.",1374959627

6114451,comment,6112605,6113849,2,0,networked,,,"Today was my first real experience with Windows Phone (I set up a -- yes --  Samsung device running Windows Phone 7.8, the latest update to the previous release, for a relative). My first impression of it was that the UI and the core apps felt responsive and well-designed. Sadly, I ran into a error whereby Outlook.com refused to import an Outlook 2007 CSV file with contacts to sync with the phone. I soon figured out the reason behind the error was Office 2007&#x27;s UI language being set to something other than English, which caused Outlook to generate a header for the CSV file with the field names listed in that locale, which in turn  Outlook.com refused to parse. Disappointing, particularly  in light of otherwise decent localization. Other than that, though, actually using it has more or less convinced me to consider a Windows Phone device as my next phone. AFAIK, WP8 doesn&#x27;t rely on Zune the way WP7 does. Does it play well with Linux in practice?<p>By the way, how do the privacy policies of Windows Phone and Microsoft Live services compare to those of matching products from Apple and Google? I have tried and failed to find a systematic comparison (i.e., a table) of how much data about the user the three mobile OSes and their vendors&#x27; apps collect and what they say about redistribution the data to third parties.

6114436,comment,6113619,6113619,1,0,enraged_camel,,,"I, too, am obsessed with fitness. In my experience, most people can&#x27;t lose weight because they don&#x27;t know how habits work and cannot use that knowledge to form the right ones.<p>Every habit consists of three components: cue, routine, reward. Something triggers the behavior, you perform the behavior, and you reap some reward. Rinse, repeat.<p>For example, a lot of people eat food - especially sweet food - to deal with stress. The cue that triggers the behavior is stress, the behavior itself is eating food, and the reward is the taste of that food. Repeating this enough times causes the person to get fat.<p>Knowing this, it is also possible to engineer new habits. The way you do this is by starting from the end of the loop - the reward - and work your way backwards. For example, the reward (your motivation) for working out may be to become more attractive. From there, you may decide that going to the gym would help you lose weight, gain muscle and become more attractive, so that would be your routine. And the last part would be to figure out a cue, something that would trigger the routine. This works best as something that will remind you of the reward, such as looking at pictures of hot women.<p>After you engineer the habit, you can also engineer your life around each component. For example, you can put up posters of hot women on your bedroom wall so that even if you come home tired, the pictures would remind you of your motivation and trigger the gym routine of &quot;put on clothes, go to the gym, work out.&quot; You can choose to live within a few blocks of said gym (or build a home gym) so that executing the routine after it is triggered by the cue is as easy as possible. Basically the formula for making sure you continue the habit is: maximize cues + minimize the effort for the routine = maximize rewards. (Side note: this also works the other way around. If you&#x27;re trying to quit smoking, keeping your cigarettes as far away as possible, such as on one of the top shelves in the kitchen, helps quite a bit.)<p>The part that takes willpower is executing the routine. That&#x27;s why willpower is so important, especially at the beginning. The further away you live from the gym, the more willpower it will require to actually go. In contrast, the stronger your motivation, the less willpower the routine will take to execute.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s quite a bit more to be said about the topic. But that&#x27;s the psychological aspect of it.",1374959241

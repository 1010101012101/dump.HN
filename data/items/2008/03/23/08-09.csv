No self respected matture person will participate in a stupid scavange hunt for work.  Either work, or go home and work on your side-project.   Stupid things like the ""rope course"" or anything done for ""bonding"" are retarded coorporate bullshit.  Having gove from a 20 000+ company, to a smaller 200 people company, I can say you there is a huge difference how things work.<p>Unfortunately, as my current company has grown,  (it had 120 people when I joined it), I keep seeing some of the same stuff that I saw happening on my old one.  Kinda scary dejavu, that your company is not small anymore, but wants to be ""mature"".\nThere are certain kind of people that like this type of enviroment, where with good ass-kissing,and political games, they can move ahead on the ladder, while they would never would be able to pull it off in a small company.   In small companies (i.e. startups), are the real place where you can be ""all you can be"".  You can shine, and your work will be visible and very important to the success of the company.<p>Here is my other question to people in here.  Sillicon Valley is the place to be if you want to work in a STARTUP.  Sure, it is a expensive place, housing is insane, gas is expensive, but it is one of the few places that allows you to strike it rich.  It is like the Hollywood for software engineers.  \nSo, my questions to those people that are working in the big boring mega-coprs,  ""If you are not originally from the area, and not working in a startup, wtf are you doing here?    Why didn't just stay home,  and work at the boring mega-corps of your area,  (which unless it is manhatan, it probably is a much cheaper place to live).",1206262636

Many of the problems he complained about were solved later by the community, businesses, or simply by technological progress. Solved profitably, I might add. Sure, one has to subtract the ""disruptive silver bullet hype"" from some of the issues, but then one finds a lot of real business opportunities. I love those complaints.",1206261968

143910,comment,143880,143880,0,0,phaedrus,,,"This is an interesting and insightful article, but in my experience a person's superstition leads to the exact opposite effect:  it gets in the way a person deducing a correct model of a how something works on a computer.  The article postulates that because the forces at work in software are unseen and made up, that a person who believes in magic will be better equipped to understand it.  I counter that precisely because the mechanism is unseen, it takes a sharper scientific mind to model the hidden mechanism - which is essential to predict cause and effect for new phenomena.  As a software developer I've worked very hard to make things easy in a program's interface, only to find the users perpetuating myths from trainer to trainee about very complicated things they have to do to get it to work - sequences of actions which don't have any effect but which worked once and are repeated superstitiously instead of doing things easily.<p>Another example of how a belief in ""spirits"" hobbles your ability to properly use the internet, would be my father:  he consistently misspells URLs, and gets angry when it doesn't work.  When I tell him they have to be typed exactly, he always dismisses it by saying ""oh they'll know what I mean.""  No matter how hard I try, I cannot convince him that <i>there is no THEY</i> on the other end of the address box!!  But his superstitious nature will not allow him to change his convictions that all these purely mechanical things the software does are not orchestrated by ""spirits"" (a.k.a. imaginary human operators).",1206261591
143909,comment,143551,143802,0,0,david927,,,"I disagree (without the economics pedigree, so forgive me if I'm missing something).  Politics and greed aren't all powerful and they certainly existed in the 30's.  But I think he's exaggerating some aspects.  In 1971, the US went completely off the gold standard not from bankruptcy but because it could.  And it worked.  In a sense it was a coup because it enabled unprecedented growth.  The problem is that letting government completely control inflation (an invisible tax that rewards investment and punishes hoarding cash) is like letting the kid in the candy store -- with similar binging consequences.<p>In the end, I agree with the author that we'll see a downturn worse than the 30's.  Most people didn't see that one coming either.",1206261481

A complex and rich taste all by itself, so you don't have to add much to it.<p>My favorite local ramen shop (Ramen Halu in San Jose, near Saratoga Ave and 280) uses it to make Tsukemen (sort of a dipping ramen, with cold soba noodles and hot broth and dipping sauce).  Amazingly good. :D",1206260636

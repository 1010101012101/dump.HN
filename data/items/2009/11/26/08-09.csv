But that's no excuse to just publish in blogs though.<p>Even if they can't find a climate journal to publish in, there would be other journals (physics journals, economics journals, applied mathematics journals) that would take a good skeptical article.<p>They could even pull a Sokal, and use fake data and dodgy analysis to write an article aimed at discrediting the climate community.<p>I haven't seen either of those happening, so I'm guessing that their position is still pretty weak.",1259225997

962444,comment,962332,962406,0,0,rudin,,,"My point is they are shifting the data arbitrarily. The Thordon data points are lower than both the Kelburn and Airport data points for the following reason: ""Thorndon (closed 31 Dec 1927) has no overlap with Kelburn (opened 1 Jan 1928). For the purpose of illustration, we have applied the same offset to Thorndon as was calculated for the Airport."" - i.e. they shifted it down as much as the Airport even though the Airport has a higher average temperature",1259225402

962441,comment,962332,962431,0,0,jacoblyles,,,"Yes, this amateurish analysis detracts from what ought to be the real outrage from the CRU leak: the lack of transparency, denying FOI requests, and lying to the public about it.

962436,comment,960945,960971,0,0,duskwuff,,,"> At some point it gets harder to find stuff that you can include on pages about historical events, objects and people.<p>That, and the standards have risen. It used to be that there were plenty of unwritten articles, so throwing together articles from common knowledge and anecdote was ""good enough"". Nowadays, there's a lot more focus on high-quality referenced work -- and, while that's a lot more useful in the long run, it's also a lot harder to write. And the majority new users simply aren't up to the task. High-quality writing is <i>hard</i>, and crowdsourcing doesn't make it any easier.",1259223879
962435,comment,962332,962332,0,0,davidppp,,,"I'm a New Zealander.<p>The source of the ""facts"" in this blog post is none other than Ian Wishart, who is regarded by many in New Zealand as a crackpot. He is anti-gay, anti-science, anti-evolution, and very right wing. If you cross Murray from ""Flight of the Chonchords"" with Glenn Beck, you'll have a pretty good idea of who the guy is. Here's a review of one of his more recent books:<p><a href=""http://www.nzherald.co.nz/books/news/article.cfm?c_id=134&objectid=10437680&pnum=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nzherald.co.nz/books/news/article.cfm?c_id=134&#3...</a><p>Ian Wishart will not be very well known outside New Zealand, so I just wanted to point out that he has a massive agenda, as well as a reputation for relentlessly cherry-picking facts to support his points of view. Very few in NZ take him seriously. I strongly encourage all of you to treat his writings (which were mostly just reprinted in the link posted by cwan) with an extreme level of skepticism.<p>Finally, the New Zealand scientist mentioned in the post, Jim Salinger, does have an excellent reputation in New Zealand and around the world. He was part of the IPCC group, for example. It is a real shame, but I have a feeling his name is about to be dragged through the mud by these crackpots. I was very, very surprised to see his name associated with science as bad as that mentioned in the original blog post, until I saw that Ian Wishart was the source of the information.",1259223719

962432,comment,962332,962332,0,0,ewjordan,,,"There's more on this at <a href=""http://www.climatescience.org.nz/images/PDFs/global_warming_nz2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.climatescience.org.nz/images/PDFs/global_warming_...</a> [PDF], including some more detailed graphs at the end.<p>Full disclosure: I'm coming at this from the initial point of view that the global warming folks are probably right, primarily because all of my experience with scientists in other fields (mostly physics and biology) has taught me that the scientific ""establishment"" is generally far more interested in seeking the actual truth than pandering to convenient politics.<p>However, without explanation for why the slopes of the graphs were shifted during the adjustments, I'd say there's some definite cause for concern here.  At the very least, these adjustments should be explained in detail so the rationale can be examined.<p>Back on the other hand, I'm very suspicious of a blanket statement that there's no reason to apply any adjustments here, especially coming from someone that opportunistically publishes this right on the heels of a very negative PR blitz against AGW.  So I think we should reserve judgment until the people that made these adjustments explain in detail how they calculated them; it's very possible that they had excellent reasons to adjust things the way they did, but they really ought to provide the supplemental data sets that are required to compute these adjustments if they want to save face here.<p>And I absolutely agree that the fact that this information is missing in the first place is unacceptable in a scientific field; future AGW researchers need to learn a lesson from all of this, that even if they are right, they need to tread carefully because of the intense scrutiny they are under.  And by ""tread carefully"" I mean treat your data as rigorously and make it available as easily as if this was any other scientific pursuit.  Evolutionary biologists are under a lot of fire, too, from a lot of the same asshats that are funding anti-AGW work, but you don't see them witholding data or stonewalling people asking questions, at least until they become obnoxious or take the argument past science.<p>You only get to shout people down once they already have access to all the data they need in order to see (if only they weren't so dense) that you are right!<p>Edit: it's worth noting that the only references I've seen on any of this come straight from the blog post, not from NIWA itself.  So I don't know if we can trust those pictures at all, or if perhaps the alterations <i>are</i>, in fact, explained somewhere.",1259223272

If you're publishing scientific stuff on a blog or in a newspaper, instead of in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, then you're playing politics, not science.<p>This topic has been politicised enough.

962430,comment,962200,962200,0,0,ephermata,,,"I recently heard about the business of teaching people how to form syndicates to buy ""short sale"" homes and then flip those homes for a profit. (Short sale == sell house for less than the loan value.) If you pay $$ to a guru you can get standardized contracts, hand holding, etc. Example blog post from someone in this area:\n<a href=""http://cawholesaledeals.com/blog/tag/short-sale-syndication/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cawholesaledeals.com/blog/tag/short-sale-syndication/</a><p>Leaving aside the morality of these gurus...<p>Wonder if this would be a thin edge of the wedge area to start with aggregating data on house sales? People are already meeting in person and swapping information about where are the sales, which ones do they want to syndicate, so you have less of a bootstrapping problem. You could also provide ways for people to signal interest in a particular home deal, or provide a commission to people who bring in data on a home that is later successfully syndicated/sold even if the reporter isn't in on the deal. Maybe there are other approaches. Then grow from that segment to more real estate data if the model proves out.",1259223183

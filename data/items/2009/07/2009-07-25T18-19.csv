Their search engine is certainly the most successful distribution channel, and they have (with somewhat less success) added other distribution channels such as AdSense, which is a partnership distribution model.<p>Whereas NYT is obligated to invest in journalism to generate distribution, Google invests in useful tools.

However, periodically we'd like to see other more detailed events for sanity or cross checking, in a report-type fashion. This is the kind of thing that Excel would do nicely, after extracting from our DB (MySQL, via csv), but that's a pain to do periodically. We'd like to see things like a graph of events of type X per day, or per day of the week, or per week, for a certain period.

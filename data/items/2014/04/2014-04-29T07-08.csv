Yet, somehow, everything he did was different.</i><p>I found this quote especially interesting. I&#x27;ve often found this to be true, that you look over at someone who&#x27;s much better, and on one hand they&#x27;re just doing the same things you&#x27;re doing, but somehow they&#x27;re just on a different level. It&#x27;s very difficult to distinguish exactly how someone achieves better results, that is, until it&#x27;s been explained. Here, we see this clearly in how the level of lung function is perceived. Both centers provide the same treatment, but at the Cincinnati center lung levels around 70% are &quot;okay&quot;, but at Minnesota, any drop is unacceptable, even if the patient is already at above-normal levels.<p>It sort of reminds me of the &quot;Don&#x27;t deal with it, fix it&quot; article that was also posted recently. You&#x27;ll be coasting around at a certain stable level of engagement until one day you see something you&#x27;ve never considered before and all of a sudden you see a whole new world of possibilities.",1398758396

I started with BASIC, then learned Java and a bit of Pascal, Perl, etc., but C was my first language with pointers. Now it seems silly, but understanding pointers was a huge step to me. There&#x27;s a before and an after. Getting used to owned/transferable pointers seems to involve a similar step, although it&#x27;s probably easier this time since I understand what they do.<p>Btw., if you like this kind of intelligent pointers, Vala something similar [1], and the syntax seems a bit easier at first glance. You have owned pointers (and can transfer ownership), shared pointers (with reference counting) and unmanaged pointers. It uses reference counting for all the UI stuff (Vala is highly integrated with Glib and Gtk), since that is usually not performance critical and you&#x27;d rather be correct there. If you feel the need to do without reference counting, you can manage memory manually, too.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala/ReferenceHandling"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala/ReferenceHandling</a>",1398758275

That model is increasingly less relevant to real work. To imagine that merely changing these outdated labor laws which take factory work as the norm and tweaking the numbers on them in a &quot;favorable&quot; direction will somehow magically greater enrich or empower individual workers is like imagining that changing the laws of horse ownership is going to affect transportation in the mid 20th century. You&#x27;re turning a knob that isn&#x27;t connected to the right thing anymore. There are ways to empower individual workers in the 21st century economy, but those ways have very little to do with factory work, and changing the number of hours they are &quot;forced&quot; to work is so far removed from what actually matters as to be ridiculous.",1398758248

Furthermore, let is not auto, it does pattern matching, it&#x27;s not just a limited form of type inference (or it&#x27;d be after the colon, where the type goes).<p>* match is much the same, it&#x27;s a pattern-matching construct not just a jump table<p>* box is for placement box, IIRC it&#x27;s similar to a universal placement new. For instance it can be used thus:<p><pre><code>    // looks like it returns a basic stack-allocated value\n    fn foo() -> int {\n        3\n    }\n\n    let stack_allocated = foo();\n    let heap_allocated = box foo();\n\n  the second one has no more overhead than if the function had returned `box 3` and a ~int (~unique_ptr<int>) in the first place. This also works for structs, the caller can decide where he wants the return value allocated.</code></pre>",1398757863

Each update contains more &quot;Sign in to  your browser&quot; stuff plastered everywhere. Eye candy is added.  Useful configuration options are removed.[1] Many of these changes seem to be made with the goal of increasing revenue, not improving user experience.<p>Rule #0 of business is: Listen to your users. For browsers, one straightforward way to do this is to look at what extensions and addons users install. By far, the winner is adblock. Almost everyone who knows how to block ads does so. Therefore, if you are making a browser and you care about user experience above everything else, you will have ad blocking by default. That no major browser does tells us what their priorities really are.<p>Again, apologies for the negativity. This has frustrated me for some time.<p>Edit: I realize that if everyone suddenly started blocking ads, there would be darkness and chaos. But the current situation is only tenable because a small fraction of users have the know-how to get what they want. You can avoid ads if you are technically proficient or know someone who is. Everyone else has to put up with ads. Advertisers annoy millions if not <i>billions</i> of people, effectively subsidizing the usage of those with ad blockers. That doesn&#x27;t seem fair to me.<p>1.

7665509,comment,7663431,7664215,2,0,zackbrown,,,"> Again...WTF does that even mean? So they only use CSS3 transforms that are GPU accelerated? So it&#x27;s a CSS3 animation library? The vague documentation seems to imply a grander vision which is unclear.<p>The core of Famo.us is a rendering engine.  Instead of using the DOM to represent its UI hierarchy or using the browser to render that hierarchical DOM to screen, it uses an internal scene graph representation and handles the rendering of the scene graph to screen through an abstracted output layer.  The browser DOM is just one of its supported outputs; another is WebGL, and there&#x27;s no reason there couldn&#x27;t be other outputs, outside of the browser--I think this extensibility is part of the &#x27;grander vision.&#x27;  The scene graph is a very robust graphics model, so it would be a great choice for a model if someone were to reinvent HTML from scratch today.  Again, &#x27;grander vision,&#x27; maybe.<p>In the case of rendering to the browser, the way it works is by flattening and compositing its scene graph, creating a DOM node for each &#x27;Surface&#x27; (which is a leaf node of the Famo.us scene graph) and handling the 3-space (or really, 2.5-space) positioning with CSS3 Matrix3D transforms, which are GPU accelerated.  Since the DOM isn&#x27;t needed for hierarchy (again, all of the calculations are handled by the engine) the Famo.us-outputted DOM is a simplified set of sibling nodes underneath a single parent (the Famo.us container,) and it continuously updates the Surfaces&#x27; DOM representations&#x27; Matrix3D properties (performantly, leveraging requestAnimationFrame) as the scene graph gets updated by the program running on the Famo.us engine.<p>So that&#x27;s pretty much what Famo.us is.  Does that help?  A slightly less technical, if more practical explanation might be about how you can &quot;write one JS app [and] deploy everywhere with awesome performance across devices and browsers.&quot;",1398756671

While this may be considered a shoestring budget in developed countries, it is completely reasonable in developing countries such as South Africa. Here, $3500 equates to roughly R37&#x27;000, which would be considered a decent monthly salary for a mid-level to senior software developer (depending on location, of course). So from this perspective, a South African developer would easily be able to spend a month developing such a prototype, which is almost enough time to develop a functional system for a simple-enough use-case.

After working several month on a side project with Go, I have given up, because I&#x27;ve felt not as productive as with Java (not to mention Scala). There are lots of annoying things: missing generics leading to a lot of uselesse code which could carry bugs. Without generics you can not create an Option datastructure, but have to return nil (the million dollar mistake of Hoare). Without generics you can not write concise object/functional code like someCollection.map(i -> i * i). Go has no good support for immutability. Mocking is awkward, because you have to code your mocks by hand. Unicode handling is a pain.<p>That is why Go attracts mainly people from scripting languages (they get a bit more type safety and better performance) and C (they get a bit more type safety and less errors). Coming from other languages Go is not that attractive. I&#x27;m hoping for Rust to succeed.",1398755370

In C++ it&#x27;s not really possible to be completely safe, and pretty much all real-world C++ I&#x27;ve seen doesn&#x27;t even come close to that ideal, using raw pointers frequently; the result is that crashes can be relatively mysterious and, perhaps more importantly, that in large C++ codebases with lots of attack surface, like browsers, security vulnerabilities are extremely frequent.  So yes, memory management is a serious problem.<p>In particular, there is no way to replicate Rust-style borrowed pointers in C++, which make safe low-level programming easier.<p>> 4 - the Rust switch statement don&#x27;t fall through... This one was truly mind blowing. The one useful feature of switch statement got ripped it out! If you don&#x27;t really need the fall through, I&#x27;d just avoid using them completely...<p>Most C++ code uses switch frequently, usually without taking advantage of fallthrough.  Rust match is good for this, but it can also be used for more complex things (destructuring); using this frequently makes for code that looks quite different from C++.<p>> The main reason I&#x27;m consistently happy with using C++ (and why I put up with the header files) is that everything is available.<p>The bad news: as Rust is still a very unstable language, there isn&#x27;t much of a library ecosystem.<p>The good news: by release, Rust will have a standard package manager, which should make importing libraries easier than in C and C++ where every package has its own build system.  I think Go has been pretty successful with this approach.<p>> Since Rust seems so close to C++, does this mean that linking to C++ code is trivial?<p>Nope... I would personally like this feature, although it would be difficult to make reliable because Rust has different semantics in various areas - OOP is very different, templates are (intentionally) not as powerful, etc.<p>However, you can import C headers using rust-bindgen [1] and fairly easily link to C code.<p><a href=""https://github.com/crabtw/rust-bindgen"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/crabtw/rust-bindgen</a>",1398755114

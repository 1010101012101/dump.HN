IMHO until you have atleast a soft real time problem that you are solving, it just isn't worth worrying about code performance. It's more important to worry about developer performance. I know that type inference does help with that.<p>My bad I didn't follow the scala link. But the post says, ""lift code is as clean and brief as Rails, yet performs 6 times faster and is multithreaded. Additionally, because Scala is strongly typed, the compiler catches type errors.""<p>To me these aren't real advantages. It's like Java having a lot of libraries. So what, it still takes 3 times as long to do anything in it. Who care if there is more code to go around.",1179693649

I'm afraid that debating the essay on its technical merits will lead you to a fruitless discussion.",1179691783

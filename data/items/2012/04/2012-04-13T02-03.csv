Its about not always needing to go to a central url, whether that be a marketplace (ebay) or a storefront. Its the idea that you want to put your product in front of the people that matter, and make it easy for others to do the same. If your online presence is very limited you'll face a lot of the same challenges of anyone starting a store on another platform like magento, or Bigcommerce, but you'll have the advantage of being able to share your product easily...not to mention try it out without spending time and money.<p>There isn't an embed in email option yet. You could easily share a link via, but at this point we haven't built out a system for exporting the image version of your product widget into an email, seeing as our iFrames of course wouldn't work for emails.<p>Hope this helps, would love to hear more of your feedback!",1334285906

I've yet to find a greater source of technical depth regarding JavaScript.<p>> David Mark's touted his ""My Library"" as the holy grail of libraries while bashing any others, yet kept it closed source (now abandoned).<p>It seems that you've turned a blind eye. His code's been available in a multitude of ways (I've used it myself as a learning tool). There's a GitHub repository[0] as well.<p>> They are as stable as the code using them, just like their server-side counterparts.<p>The prime difference here is that most browsers do not throw markup errors or halt execution upon a bad tag; they're extremely lenient. Conversely, direct parser access via JavaScript can throw a host of errors and halt execution (as I noted with IE). Fragment builders are hampered because they're either too dynamic for their own good or need to keep a laundry list of valid attributes.<p>> Would you mind expanding on security?<p>Apart from the OWASP article I linked earlier, it's more of a statement towards older environments. Browsers today escape input nicely, but that's meaningless for Joe Smith, government bureaucrat on IE 6.

I find that looking at a stopwatch during a presentation requires less mental distraction than: (i) keeping track of the time at which my talk started (I am talking about conference talks where the talks usually start a few minutes later than the scheduled time), (ii) looking at the current time and calculating how much time is remaining (it usually takes less than a second, but it is more time consuming that a tap on my phone).<p>The trick is to disable your phone's auto lock, open the stop watch and run it. That way, you can just tap the screen (I am assuming iphone like smart phone) to see the current time. I think this can be done as discreetly as checking my watch.<p>The biggest advantage of using a stopwatch is that it provides evidence of how long you have been speaking for. I have had cases where the previous speaker overshot his/her time and a session chair tried to get back on time by cutting time from my talk. In such cases, I have had to point to my stopwatch to say that I still have more than five minutes left. (Usually the talks are twenty minutes, so having five less minutes is a big deal).

3835105,comment,3834773,3834773,1,0,6ren,,,"He's talking specifically about web APIs.<p>Web APIs tend to have simple, shallowly nested formats. In an informal survey, the deepest nesting I found was 3 levels. JSON is simple, and has resisted all efforts to complicate it, or to add to its stack. There is no popular schema for JSON, no ""JSLT"". no visual JSON mapping tools. The only tooling is databinding (and if you consider JSON as a subset of JavaScript, it arguably has not even that).<p>The XML toolchain, especially XML Schema and XSLT, is highly engineered - well, over-engineered. The designers threw in everything they could think of. As a result, even enterprise tools don't need to  support the whole spec.<p>I think it's fair to say that if you <i>need</i> something more powerful (and therefore more complicated) than JSON, you should use XML. It seems  the very existence of the XML toolchain helps <i>keep</i> JSON simple: instead of demand for complexity being channeled into over-tooling JSON, it is harmlessly diverted to XML.<p>The deeper question is: <i>do our tasks really</i> <i>NEED</i> <i>that extra complexity?</i> It seems related to loose dynamic typing vs. tight static typing (and scripting vs. compiled). Maybe web APIs are an exception - or, because very young, haven't yet needed the complexity that beset CORBA, then XML... Or maybe they <i>are</i> an exception, but it doesn't matter because everything is becoming a web API anyway. Or... maybe we're finally got it right...?<p>There are pervasive needs that JSON doesn't address. For example, there's a problem with coupling between JSON and application data structures in that they must be the same basic shape. So to give your JSON format the ideal shape for consumers, you need to translate into a layer of objects first - and your consumers need to do the same thing to get it into <i>their</i> internal data structures, Similarly, you aren't free to evolve; instead, you produce another version, and all your clients must upgrade. Most web APIs are very very young, yet have several versions already... The same problems occurred in XML (and CORBA), and though JSON is an improvement in that it allows fields to be added more easily, the tooling to support conversion/evolution hasn't grown up around it (and <i>isn't</i> growing).<p>I think the answer is that JSON works great when the underlying features of applications are changing quickly because you can't ""evolve"" around this, you need humans to rethink the basics. while ""web APIs"" continue in vigorous growth, it will dominate. Maybe it will settle down and consolidate, once everything has changed into a web API... or maybe continuous churn will become the rule, as everything accelerates?<p>[Interestingly, relational algebra squarely addressed and solved these problems 42 ago. It's still going strong; though also under attack by the similar forces (NoSQL) allied with loose dynamic typing of scripting languages, and the need for so-called ""web-scale"" performance being greater than the need for evolution/conversion... at present.]",1334283347

The problem isn't that email <i>isn't</i> integrated with anything else, it's that it <i>can't</i> be integrated with anything else. And the reason for that is email is flat text (or gussied-up flat text in semi-HTML), and nothing else on your system can understand it.<p>If your bug request came wrapped in some metadata about how it's a bug request, then it would be easy to further integrate that into all sorts of things.<p>OK, that's great. So why doesn't <i>that</i> happen? Because defining such metadata formats is a non-trivial exercise, and even more difficult is getting everyone to <i>use</i> those formats. So it turns out this is really just another specific instance of the Great Semantic Divide, namely, how the heck can we actually share semantics in any reasonable manner on large scales? It's the exact same reason the Semantic Web hasn't happened.<p>Further, even if <i>that</i> hurdle were to be crossed, you'd have the problem that somebody, somewhere has to fill out the definition of a ""bug report"" before it can be wrapped in the relevant metadata. Right now this step occurs when you take the email and translate it into your todo system (or bug tracker or whatever). In this perfect world this supposedly is done by the sender... but that, too, is fraught with problems, because that takes a certain level of skill on the sender side and now you've lost the aspect of email where you just click ""New Email"", bash on the keyboard for a bit, and hit ""Send"", and it mostly works. There's also some important context issues, which is that even if the bug or task was perfectly filled out by the sender from their point of view you'll still need to tweak it because you have a different perspective on things.

It would be interesting to hear from someone that has used both technologies to see how they compare in practice.",1334283100

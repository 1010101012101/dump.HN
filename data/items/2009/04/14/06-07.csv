561121,comment,561057,561067,0,0,gills,,,"It looks like they replace the crankshaft with electromotive components, attaching the piston rod directly to either a linear actuator or a rotating generator.<p>At first I was pretty skeptical if the usefulness of such a device.  The crankshaft in an engine transfers power to a load, but it also performs an elegant and complicated synchronization task for multiple cylinders and ancillary systems (like lubrication, cooling, fuel supply, ...).<p>But the crank also imposes a practical limit on stroke length because a long stroke in a small space gives you pretty high angles and less efficient power transfer.  The short stroke puts an artificially-low limit on the fraction of energy from the combustion that can be recovered.<p>Attaching a kinetic-to-electric conversion device directly to the cylinder allows the stroke length to be longer (basically unbounded) so a larger fraction of the energy can be captured, and less wasted as heat.<p>Then a multi-cylinder engine basically becomes a computer program, where it's easy to implement fine timing, synchronization, load-balancing and load-prediction tasks using sensor networks.<p>I'm skeptical that it would be more useful than just dropping the mechanical conversion and it's relatively high losses, and using something like a fuel cell instead.",1239691846

This site seems to be trying new things but a visit to the new section suggests it's not invulnerable. Presumably killing them all isn't a viable solution, so either everyone periodically moves on to the next new hot site, or we learn to live with them (and them with us).",1239691594

561100,comment,560802,560802,0,0,areaMan,,,"I had this unusual ability to memorize entire chapters of Biology and History. And unusually I could do it only with these two subjects, as for me they were the most difficult to understand and relate to. Let me just give you an example. The tests papers would question things like:\na) give any two symptoms of malaria (2 marks)\nb) list all symptoms of malaria (7 marks)<p>And I hated to lose marks and overall class rank because of this one stupid Biology, and let's say I covered malaria but this time they chose to ask about treatment for cholera.I reasoned to myself, they could ask anything. So I might memorize all symptoms/treatments of malaria AND cholera. During one such exam preparations (must've been grade 7/8) by the end of it I had an epiphany that I'd just memorized the entire chapter. I even parroted it back to my mom making her happy that here I was ready to take on the diseases of this world. The notable point is that only after that realisation, I became very good at memorizing entire chapters. I remember by 9th grade I could almost memorize the 4-5 chapters of Biology. Surprisingly it happened mostly with Biology, a subject I hated the most, Chemistry equations which our teachers never explained because even they didn't know what the fuck was going on in there with those molecules(S8+8O2=8SO2?), dates in History and exact word-for-word quotes in languages -- all things that needed memorization. I could never remember say for example the 4-digit number plate of the cars which just passed by at 60kmph even after I had summed up its digits and they came out less than 30, and done so for all the 15 cars that passed by within 30 seconds or so (try this game, its fun and it'll improve your number skills).<p>And quite unsurprisingly, after my schooling, when this ability was no more required, I slowly started losing it. I always wondered if I could get that 'magic' back so to speak. Is there a name for this condition - the ability to channel immense memory powers when needed?<p>btw, if you guys are wondering this was an Indian school system. I also had other freakish abilities, but for now I'd leave it at that.",1239690177
561099,comment,560501,560917,0,0,sho,,,"Yes, the basic technology is flash memory, but it is packaged and accessed in the form of a disk drive, and it is conventional to refer to it in that way.<p>Claiming ""512GB flash memory"" is a pretty non-standard way of saying ""contains an array of 8x64GB SSDs"", or however they've organised it. Other vendors don't do that. The implementation of the storage array is a pretty salient factor in a device of this type, wouldn't you say? I would certainly want to know, for example, the interface by which the array was accessed, its filesystem, its RAID type, etc. Referring to them as ""memory"" implies a memory-bus-speed interface, and the x-25 is a SATA device.<p><a href=""http://www.intel.com/design/flash/nand/extreme/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intel.com/design/flash/nand/extreme/index.htm</a><p>The implementation and interface is highly relevant.

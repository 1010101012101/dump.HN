The Gates family owns multiple homes, one in Washington being over 50,000 square feet, that will likely stay in the family and where the children would presumably be allowed to stay should they choose.<p>Hopefully his kids choose to be productive.

My understanding is that the earlier versions of SQL Server kind of sucked, but the new ones are fantastic. The sibling post&#x27;s point is valid for 2008R2 and earlier - you had to use a ROW_NUMBER() subquery - but that was one of the very few niggles.<p>I wasn&#x27;t a fan of Oracle in general - it&#x27;s comparatively a nightmare to setup and maintain, and in my opinion the SQL syntax is uglier. But from a dev/support standpoint, Oracle&#x27;s flashback queries is what impressed me - in Oracle you can write something like SELECT * FROM table AS OF TIMESTAMP. So, say, if you accidentally deleted a couple rows and committed the transaction, you could restore them using a flashback query. My impression was that Oracle was more scalable and supported more enterprisey features, but that&#x27;s not really my area of expertise.<p>Honestly, if SQL Server wasn&#x27;t wildly expensive for any real work, it would be my number one choice and my number one recommendation. Guess you can&#x27;t have everything. And Oracle, of course, is even more expensive. So Postgres it is!<p>...well, except on my Dreamhost sites, because MySQL is what they have.",1395315905

You show the content of that span when form.length.$error.float is truthy. Probably when it exists.<p>And yes, AngularJS absolutely defines its own language. The directives create an enhanced HTML (that you can enhance even further), and it has its own expression language where you can ask the value of `form.length.$error.float` without fearing null pointers.<p>This is basically what Angular is about, and why it works as nicely and cleanly as it does. And it&#x27;s true; learning a new framework is absolutely comparable to learning a new language. Rails is not simply standard Ruby; it defines loads of new stuff that automatically handles things for you below the surface. Spring completely changes the way you work with Java. Grails has its own DSLs for various tasks.<p>Every framework has a learning curve. And a framework that doesn&#x27;t change how you think is as useless to learn as a language that doesn&#x27;t change how you think. But if you don&#x27;t like learning, you can always simply stick to what you&#x27;re familiar with.",1395313640

What if the colossal supply of this material (which as a hydrocarbon, had bound-potential-energy in it), over what&#x27;s going to be a colossally long period of time, gives enough interaction surface that somewhere out there, a bacteria evolves that <i>breaks down plastic</i>?<p>I hardly expect this would be the collapse of civilization or anything (as depicted in the book), but it really could have some nasty consequences.  Plastic is relied on almost for precisely that reason - the fact that it <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> decay/rust/collapse over time.  That&#x27;s why we use it for stuff like medical implants, safety gloves, food storage, sanitary containers ... you name it.  It could lose its un-decayable and its sanitary property in one go.<p>Kinda like the problem with overuse of antibiotics.",1395313613

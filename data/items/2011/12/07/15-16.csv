I'd bet that there are 100 times as many Python 3 programmers as there are Perl 6 programmers.<p>I think Perl 6 still has a chance, though. No reason to dismiss it just because it's developing slowly.<p>The compatibility mode doesn't do Perl 6 much good, if you ask me. There are already too many ways to write Perl, if you ask a Python programmer. It's like writing C in C++.",1323273593

3324295,comment,3323853,3324006,8,0,jerf,,,"Meh, they've tested Newton's laws numerous times. If everybody knew them, both intellectually and in their bones, they wouldn't have the myths to test, but alas, I don't think you can claim with a straight face that we live in a society with universal knowledge and deep understanding of Newton's laws.<p>... and if you think you do, spend some time on the much-referenced ""fan site"".<p>And furthermore, there is nothing unscientific or wrong about testing our most well-tested theories. The entire point of science is that even then, the theories will <i>still</i> work, not that you should never test them again.<p>I'd also further observe that for all the drama happening here, those swinging gun sequences aren't <i>that</i> unsafe. It may look unsafe but the actual set of things that can plausibly go wrong was less than your intuition may be claiming. It's not like there was a way they were going to shoot themselves with a particularly higher probability than usual. (And remember that if you start constructing far-out implausible scenarios under which that might happen you must be willing to worry about equally improbably things <i>all the time</i>; one rapidly gets to the point where things like simply driving to work must be considered too unsafe to do if one starts spending too much improbability on the constructed scenario.)",1323273563

3324288,comment,3323950,3324141,8,0,swombat,,,"<i>Heck, it might require less effort overall to write it once in Flex, and then rewrite it in JS four years later than it would have done to write it in JS in 2007 and then keep it up to date with a changing JS landscape over that time.</i><p>That's definitely one way to do it, but it depends on the technology and the resource constraints. Ultimately, you have to pick some technologies to rely on. Sure, in theory you can architect your multi-tier app so that you can swap out Java for .NET, or Python for Rails, or Postgres for MySQL, or even HTML/JS for Flex, but those are all difficult and costly swaps to perform. And most startups can't afford to build expensive components twice. They have to make a gamble.<p>Full-Flex front-end was an accepted model in 2007, with a fair few apps following it. Yes, we could have built just the explorer component in Flex, but that would have had a number of other problems (such as loading times every time you changed a tab, for example). More critically, when we started we had only a vague idea of what this explorer tab might look like. Like many startups, we were discovering our customers' actual needs as we went along, and so it wasn't possible to just declare ""the explorer component will look like this and it will be built in Flex"", because to be honest, though we suspected the explorer component would be important, and had some ideas about what it should look like, those were completely unchecked assumptions.<p><i>And you can't ever be sure that you picked the technology on the right side. So design your systems so that it doesn't matter which side wins, you can adjust to the new reality and keep going.</i><p>You can't ever be <i>sure</i> that you <i>did</i> pick the right technology to ""stand the test of time"", but sometimes you can be relatively sure that you didn't. Even in 2007, for anyone with good knowledge of Open Source, it was clear that eventually, Flex would be losing to open technologies. It wasn't clear how long that would take, and whether Adobe might counter that by opening up Flex, but certainly there were strong concerns about Flex (which we were aware of, but didn't really factor in as strongly as we should have). Similarly, anyone building a startup that critically relies on Java (or, more controversially, PHP) today is picking a technology that's waning and will certainly be largely irrelevant in 1, 3-5 (most likely), or 7 years at most.",1323273422

Sure, there's Node.js and probably others too.<p>Once you have a serious project, where you have dependencies and build systems and source control, it's not a very big issue to get install a few libs. But for small projects, Python's batteries come in handy. And some of those small projects turn into big projects.<p>What comes to Python 2 vs. Python 3, I feel it's a ""can't make an omelette without breaking eggs"" kind of issue. Unfortunately many people are running business critical applications with Python 2 and are not willing to put in the effort to migrate their code to Python 3.

Methods are dynamic by definition: the type of the method's target is inspected at runtime and used to dispatch to the correct function entry. In Python, it's explicitly stated because the first argument of all object methods is ""self"". Multimethods extend this to do dynamic dispatch on all argument types, not just the target object.<p>Most Python object methods are declared at compile time; this doesn't make method declaration a ""subset of static typing"". You can add new methods to classes and objects at runtime using Python's reflection and introspection; you can just as easily add new multimethods at runtime using this framework.<p>Finally, the @decorator(...) syntax at compile time is just syntactic sugar for something like the following:<p><pre><code>  def _foo(self, arg):\n    ...\n  foo = decorator()(_foo)\n</code></pre>\nSo you can use decorators at runtime whenever you want too.",1323271843

In service of this goal a cafeteria, coffee shop and the employee mail room were clustered within steps of each other within the atrium of the main building.

I'm confident that they <i>will</i> be solved, which some of my peers might even consider a naively optimistic attitude.<p>><i>The question is - can humans do this? If yes, computers can do it eventually.</i><p>This logic is deeply, deeply flawed.  I happen to believe that computers can eventually perform the tasks under discussion, but ""humans can do it"" is not one of the reasons why I believe that.<p>><i>So really, your problems are a question of data collection. It is not a technically difficult problem.</i><p>When it comes to tracking airborne targets with airborne radar, data collection actually <i>is</i> a technically difficult problem.  The combination of waveform, antenna design, transmitter design, receiver design, tracker design, etc. present a set of engineering tradeoffs in effective range, range resolution, azimuth resolution, weight, size, flase positive and false negative rates on radar returns, and other performance characteristics.  Even the very best airborne radars provide data which is limited, especially in terms of accuracy and precision.<p>><i>By the way, one of the problems you have in aerospace is, is that you're control theory heavy rather than pro-ai, which means you end up not being able to solve the difficult problems.</i><p>A little more about my background: my BS is in EE, with a specialization in microcomputer interfacing (I took a lot of CS classes).  In grad school, my stability and control prof had actually done some pioneering work in incorporating non-linear logic into stability and control systems (don't try this at home, kids).  In addition to stability and control, my other focus for my MS was avionics.  The prof who taught most of my avionics classes was actually from the CS department (his undergraduate background was EE, with a specialization in radar).  One of the things that kind of surprised me about aero, having come from EE, was how broad the discipline is.  Before going back to school for aero, I thought that getting a degree in aeronautical engineering would be primarily about aerodynamics, with a smattering of other stuff.  Instead, I discovered that everyone gets a little bit of everything (aerodynamics, propulsion, structures, stability and control, avionics), and then specializes in one or two particular areas.  By the PhD level, people who have specialized in areas other than aerodynamics have largely forgotten most of what they learned about it as undergrads.  It's an incredibly heterogeneous field: propulsion and structures guys have more in common with MechEs than with other AeroEs; avionics and stability and control guys have more in common with EEs than with other AeroEs; etc.  So to characterize the discipline, or any individual within it, as ""control theory heavy rather than pro-ai,"" displays a deep misunderstanding of the character of the community.  I guarantee you that there are plenty of AI experts working in the aero field.<p>><i>Also, the eu 80s project ended around early 90s, and the grandle challenge win was only 15 years later, not 30. Had the challenge been tried 5 years earlier, it would have worked. The algorithms and hardware was already sufficient.\n</i><p>This just reinforces my broader point: success came not as a result of some innovative genius applying a novel new approach but rather because the technology had matured--over the course of several years--to the point where success had become not only possible but likely.  Radar tracking is currently experiencing big advances for that same reason.  The theory behind Space-Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) has been around for decades, but the available technology has not been up to the task of implementing it effectively.  In the past we've resorted to less effective tracking methods such as MTI, but in the last decade or so the technology has finally made STAP reasonable to implement.",1323271043

So I made what I consider(ed) a strategic move in the summer of 2010 and left to join a government agency that is 20 minutes from my house.  In doing so I knew I'd have a better work life balance, which would allow me to pursue my goal of building a software company and working for myself (hopefully by the summer of 2012).<p>Initially I got exactly what I could have wanted...I was fortunate to land a good position in the CIO's office, which also got me back into the development game, but not even a year in, they dissolved the CIO and moved us all around to other divisions.  Since July I've maybe performed 3 hours of what could be considered work...there just is nothing for me to do, nor anything of interest in my current office.  To make matters worse, due to budget cuts/hiring freezes, you can't move around to other groups so you are stuck. Everyone I work with is in a similar boat which makes for a miserable work environment (think Joe vs. The Volcano)<p>While some people may consider getting paid just for showing up a dream job, especially given the current economy...I've never been one to sit back and collect a paycheck, I like to earn my keep.<p>And while I now essentially have 8 hours/day (paid) to work on my own company, being in such a boring, depressed environment has sapped most of my energy.  I had no desire to get out of bed in the morning, nor sit here for hours on end. All of this is starting to adversly affect my side company work.<p>If I didn't have a family and bills to pay, I'd quit and focus fulltime on my side company, so I've been casually exploring other options to help me get through this.<p>I've had inquiries from other govt agencices about coming to work for them, but I don't want to unfairly start something with them, knowing in the back of my mind I hope to leave within 6 months.<p>I've thought about offering my services as a freelancer, but honestly wouldn't even know where to start. I've been fortunate to be a jack of many trades throughout my career, and while I've been very good at networking with folks, ideally I'd want to be able to work from home 30-40 hours per week to keep the lights on.<p>It just seems to me that given the economy, and the prevalance of sites such as ODesk/Elance, it would be difficult to get on a project where you can set yourself apart and make a decent per hour wage.  But maybe I'm just skewed by my current situation.<p>I understand that 6 months isn't that long of time to suck it up, and I am very fortunate to have this job, but its tough.  Hopefully someone has had a similar experience and can shed some light on what to do.<p>Any advice/comments/criticism is welcome.  Thanks for your time!",1323270229

gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the
mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?  18:13 And if so be
that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that
sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.<p>18:14 Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven,
that one of these little ones should perish.<p>18:15 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell
him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou
hast gained thy brother.<p>18:16 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two
more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be
established.<p>-----<p>I was raised with a certain -- you can't get what you want consumer attitude by Mom and Dad.

gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of
Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for them.<p>10:11 And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall

all they which have cast into the treasury: 12:44 For all they did
cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that
she had, even all her living.<p>13:1 And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto
him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!
13:2 And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great
buildings?  there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall
not be thrown down.<p>13:3 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple,
Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, 13:4 Tell us,
when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these
things shall be fulfilled?  13:5 And Jesus answering them began to
say, Take heed lest any man deceive you: 13:6 For many shall come in
my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.<p>----<p>Day by day.  Be a talk show?<p>God says...<p>7:6 For at the window of my house I looked through my casement, 7:7

young man void of understanding, 7:8 Passing through the street near
her corner; and he went the way to her house, 7:9 In the twilight, in
the evening, in the black and dark night: 7:10 And, behold, there met
him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.<p>7:11 (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house: 7:12
Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every
corner.)  7:13 So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent
face said unto him, 7:14 I have peace offerings with me; this day have
I payed my vows.<p>7:15 Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face,

You laugh at the cops because the terrorists are closer to God.<p>God says...<p>4:32 And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a
thousand and five.<p>4:33 And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon
even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of
beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.<p>4:34 And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from
all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.<p>5:1 And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had
heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for
Hiram was ever a lover of David.<p>5:2 And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, 5:3 Thou knowest how that David
my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God
for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put
them under the soles of his feet.<p>5:4 But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that
there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.<p>----<p>These are all psy-op mind games and the cops/CIA are all atheists expecting me to squirm.  The terrorists know there's a God.  Yer fucken morons.  Atheists are a threat to the United states, not militant Jewish rabbis killing homo atheletes cause I said God called sports gay.  Whatdoya know, God did call sports gay!

and dwelt among the people.<p>1:17 And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the
Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the
name of the city was called Hormah.<p>1:18 Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the
coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.<p>1:19 And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of
the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley,
because they had chariots of iron.<p>1:20 And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled
thence the three sons of Anak.<p>1:21 And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that
inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of
Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.<p>---<p>I thought God was invincible!  Chariots of iron?  Wait, go back!<p>Okay so Jesus taught not to condemn, except the pharasees and money changers -- the atheists who abused the sacred temple with their heathenry.... Jesus had passion for the Father.

The quality of the Atlantic continues to decline. This article basically has the accuracy of an anonymous internet forum rant.<p>However, it is true that there has been a terrible off and on war in Chechnya during the last 20 years with some tragic consequences for the civilian population. There have been many abuses perpetrated by the Russian government, but also many terrible civilian murders perpetrated by Chechen islamic groups that cannot possibly be blamed on Putin.<p>For what it worth I should say that ordinary Chechens are very much against terrorism and against the hardcore Muslim militarists. It is notable that when Chechnya was relatively independent after the first Chechen war, they elected a relatively secular president and not one of the hard core sharia law Islamists. Nevertheless, there is an armed Islamist minority in Chechnya that tends to make trouble. That secular president ended up declaring sharia law just to appease the militants.<p>The most interesting thing about this article is how differently the atlantic treats chechnya and palestine. Regardless of the Russian abuses in the region, the life of the average Chechen is much better than that of the average palestinian. Currently, Chechens cannot vote for their chosen president and tend to get hassled by police when they travel in parts of Russia outside of Chechnya but otherwise their life is a far cry from what Palestinians in the occupied territories have to endure. They are not being starved intentionally in ghettos, they do not have settlers coming in and taking their houses and farms, they are not surrounded by walls, or military firing zones, etc., they do not have to wait 9 hours at a check point to go to a neighboring village, etc.<p>Nevertheless, the Atlantic calls Chechnya a country, which it isn't and when it rarely mentions Chechen terrorism, it tries to justify it by referring to Putin's actions. The Atlantic would never call Palestine a country (even though under international law Palestine is much closer to being a country) and would never suggest that the Israeli occupation is a justification for Palestinian terrorism.<p>In summary these are all tricky issues but one way to keep our journalists and politicians honest is to hold them to the same standard when dealing with separatists from countries they like (Israel) and countries they do not like (Russia).",1366493501

I was following the BostonPoliceScanner tag or whatever it was and that information was coming straight from the police scanners. I could usually tell that some of the people misinterpreted what they were hearing and tweeted misinformation but you could easily filter that out by looking at the tweets as a whole, rather than coming just from one source. Any ONE source, I don't care who it is, is going to make errors eventually. The more sources you have, the better.<p>But I was able to listen in on the major events as they happened and that's what I wanted. I got to hear on the scanner when the first suspect was confirmed deceased and I was listening in as the police were chasing after the second suspect. I heard ""shots fired"" when they found the second suspect inside the boat, and ""suspect in custody! suspect confirmed in custody!"" when he was finally caught. Then I listened in to the police officers congratulating each other and feeling proud that their hard work and planning had paid off.<p>That's what I wanted to get out of that and that's not something you get from reading a newspaper a few hours later. You might get a nice narrative out of it, and some journalist might add some fancy and colorful language to the article, but that doesn't capture the FEELING of being part of it or the kind of suspense you get from listening to the entire thing. Nor do you get to appreciate how much work went into catching this guy. The articles afterwards read like this: ""Suspect 1 dead! Suspect 2 was captured! One officer died, another officer critically injured! Here's a picture of a bunch of cops standing around!"" But listening in, you get to hear how calm the officers are as they radio in to report some seriously intense stuff. You get to hear their professionalism and how much organization goes into everything. You get to understand fully what it is that they're doing out there. You get a far more human perspective from the incident. That's what I appreciate more than anything.",1366493188

After all, all expression is built from existing forms, and anything that's completely unrecognizable is completely inaccessible. Do you mean that the recent games you see are lacking creative focus? Or that you don't see innovative twists or fresh reinterpretations of gameplay/visual/story formulas? Maybe you can just give some specific examples of some recent games you've seen and what turns you off about them?<p>The social experience from playing games is pretty broad too. Pretty much every game has an active community behind it. I like playing fighting games; online play for most is pretty solid, and at least in the US there's always a local group of players to play, hang out, and host or go to tournaments with. The same goes for RTSs and action RTSs, even though I don't play those.<p>If you want to try playing RPGs for the story again, recent games like Nier and Xenoblade Chronicles are lauded for their story and characters. I've also heard good things about Ni no Kuni, which famed anime studio Studio Ghibli also worked on.<p>Beyond that, there's a near endless stream of quality AAA and indie games on Steam to browse or try.<p>I might be assuming too much, but whenever I hear someone say new games are bland and formulaic, it seems like they've only heard of Call of Duty, and really aren't taking any time to look for what else exists. Most games made now are bland; most games in the 90s were bland too, but since there's a ton more people making games, there's a ton more variety to choice from.

5582818,comment,5582531,5582711,5,0,bluedino,,,">  In other words - why develop on a Chromebook as opposed to a lightweight notebook?<p>It's half the price of the Lenovo you mentioned. It has fairly long battery life, it's small yet has a full-size keyboard. It's slick hardware compared to a $299 Best Buy laptop or a netbook. But it has a whole list of disadvantages.<p>You can't fire up a VM. You can't browse using the actual desktop versions of Chrome, Firefox, Opera, or IE. You can't use software package X. You need to be connected to the internet to do development. It's just a fancy ssh/rdp terminal in this case.<p>I understand the romanticism about developing on a Chromebook. I love the 11"" Air, and despite the low-resolution screen and low specs (ULV CPU, 2GB or 4GB RAM and 64GB/128GB SSD) you can actually get stuff done. Is it the 'Ultimate Developer PC'? No, but a great machine.<p>The Chromebook is far more limited, but maybe the next revision along with a regular Linux distribution will be a workable solution for the rest of us.",1366492228

5582813,comment,5578642,5579268,2,0,SatvikBeri,,,"I think Steve Jobs being a prick was directly related to his success.<p>Jobs did many awful things, such as refusing to acknowledge the existence of his daughter or effectively stealing money from Woz. But that's not where the perception of Jobs being a jerk comes from-many CEOs have done worse. The main reason people seem to have found found working for Jobs exhausting is because he'd always tell you your work was shit.<p>But the effect of this was that Jobs managed to get top performers to perform 5 or 10 times better. He took 10x people and turned them into 100x. It may have been exhausting and emotionally draining, but quite a few people report producing the best work of their lives while working for Jobs.<p>Can you imagine working with Woz, Jeff Dean, JK Rowling, or Marc Benioff and telling them their work wasn't good enough and they had to produce work that was 10x better? And being credible and convincing enough to get them to believe it?<p>Obviously, just telling people their work sucks isn't enough. I've worked with a fairly large number of people, and I've met exactly one who managed to pull significantly better performance out of me than I could myself. It was exhausting, but in the end I produced work that was substantially higher quality <i>and</i> quantity than anything I'd done before (at least outside academia). Said manager was also considered very abrasive, and people tended to love him or hate him. And it's not hard to see why-when someone tells you that the quality of your work is a small fraction of what it can and should be, it hurts.<p>Based on reports, it sounds like Steve Jobs was more or less capable of pulling those kind of performance increases out of anyone, or at least a huge variety of people. And based on the (very) small sample of people I've seen who can do the same, it seems like you need to be at least somewhat of a jerk to pull it off.<p>(Not to say that pulling great work out of people was Jobs's only skill. He was also amazing at picking markets and product design, which probably don't require you to be a jerk.)",1366492147

It is the reason why many of them are using Scala, whether they like to admit it or not. In that thread it is even argued that lambda-calculus itself is outdated because it is inherently sequential.<p>Scala attracted many idealists that aren&#x27;t pleased with any mainstream language. On one hand it is good, because it moves the language forward. By comparison the Go community is kind of toxic.

HipChat charges $2/user; I would pay $5 or $10.<p>The real problem is that tools designed for companies consolidate the billing.  If I start a chat for my local user group then I am on the hook socially to upgrade my plan to let new people join.  If I am successful in cultivating a useful chat then essentially I am punished for it, and the punishment grows without bound.  One of the groups I participate in has over a thousand members.<p>Meanwhile I would be happy to pay for a friend or three, with the understanding that the other 997 people who may want to join need to pay their own way.  And with mostly individual accounts you can probably ask for significantly more per user than HipChat can.<p>And the effort to get people to sign up might be effectively free if you funnel part of the license fee back to the organization who no longer needs to pass the hat around for pizza money or whatever.  This may create regulatory problems, but if we&#x27;re just talking about the customer acquisition equation, there are a lot of awkward situations where somebody forgot to bring cash that I would very happily roll into a monthly debit to forget about.",1371632049

Since wind/solar/hydro energy is a lot more unstable in its output, a lot more energy has to be moved around the country. Also it cannot be produced near the heavy consumers (e.g. hydro energy from the north sea to heavy industry the Ruhr area).  The instability of output also leads to more activity for coal-fired power plants, because they can bridge short solar energy lows (nuclear plants are too slow).<p>I found that article encouraging that wind/solar/hydro energy might hit break even, but I am not convinced that we are already at that point.<p>Polluting nice landscape with windmills is another downside.

They sell more if cars have shorter lifetimes - &#x27;planned obsolescence&#x27; as noted by btilly.<p>Charging companies directly and creating the financial incentives is one way of causing businesses to have a vested interest in the long-term viability of a product. It may not be what you intended when you wrote it, but a mandatory fee structure is absolutely one way to aligning usage goals.<p>If there&#x27;s a pragmatic way to incentivize increasing car and parts duration that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> involve some mandatory fee structure and somehow mimics SAAS, for cars, I haven&#x27;t come up with it.<p>Culturally, the fetishization of cars is simply a larger symptom of excessive consumerism which isn&#x27;t something likely to change any time soon (nor will it be easy to change).<p>Thanks for the response - it&#x27;s clear we have a difference of opinion on the implications of SAAS, among other things, though I think we can both agree that Tesla shaking up the industry is a good thing. :)",1371631507

The regime uses DPI to attempt to identify Tor connections, and Tor developers put out Obfsproxy.

I say this because I/O bandwidth getting exhausted is a huge issue.<p>For example, using cgroups to limit memory allocations for groups or processes seemed like a great way to fairly distribute memory. But, doing so forced such cgroups into swapping when they tried to exceed their limits, even when there was available memory on the host system. The swapping was so bad in terms of saturating disk I/O that we had two choices to maintain quality of service: (1) set the hard limit and OOM kill (or equivalent) within the cgroup when it gets exceeded or (2) not treat it as a hard limit and monitor usage separately. We chose the latter.<p>So, I honestly wonder, is it better to enforce separate page caches in the cause of fairness, even if it results in less efficient disk I/O? Or is it better to have a unified page cache and dedicate system-wide resources to increasing effective disk I/O bandwidth? (Do we focus on slicing the pie more fairly or increasing the size the pie while cutting sloppily?)",1371630114

For example, have you implemented the same &quot;$()#% authentication system for a web application 20 times?  Package up that one little piece of the puzzle into a scalable way to teach people to do it without needing to have you or someone similarly skilled on their team.  Common form factors include ebooks.  Sell the ebook.  If you want to sell lots of the ebook, start by offering some free incentive to get people to trade you their email address, then send them email about $TOPIC for a while to make them trust you as an authority on it, then ask them to buy your thing.  (Note: You don&#x27;t have to be the world&#x27;s leading expert on building authentication systems.  You&#x27;ve just taken somebody&#x27;s shilling to do it twenty times, which means that it is likely much, much cheaper for somebody to buy your thing and hand it to his junior developer than it is to pay a similarly-experienced engineer to do that part of the system.)<p>2)  Failing that, talk to businesses.  I could give you a vague fact pattern to ask about (a problem which is amenable to a solution with code) but people seem to get hung up on that so I&#x27;ll give you something really specific: you are looking for a MS Excel spreadsheet which has ever been mailed by Bob to Cindy, had Cindy edit it, and mail it back to Bob.  <i>Every time this happens a SaaS app gets its wings</i>.  Now go out and find, in the actual physical world, ten firms which have that same darn spreadsheet.  Offer to build them a software system which solves the business problem which that spreadsheet represents.  Ask if they would pay (pick a number based on how big the firm is) $50 to $250 a month for it.  If yes, ask them to commit to buying it when it is ready.  If you get 5 commits, build it, sell to them (n.b. you&#x27;ll lose some commits here), and then start trying to sell it in more scalable Internet-y ways.<p>3)  Failing that, Bingo Card Creator, an app which does <i>everything</i> wrong in terms of business model and market selection, sold ~$1k a month something like 6 months after launch just because I got halfway decent at organic SEO.  If you&#x27;re willing to get good at one generalizable acquisition strategy (SEO, Facebook ads, AdWords, etc etc), with that wind behind you even turkeys can fly.

Last weekend a friend of mine started talking about how ugly a specific kid was, then went on Facebook to look up a picture of the ugly ginger kid. Then when scrolling through &#x27;the wall&#x27; he went on and on and gave his shallow judgement about people who all were doing worse than him in some way. Probably to reassure to himself that his kid is better on the scale he invented and that his life wasn&#x27;t that bad after all. Sadly it&#x27;s not the first conversation like this I overheard. It is one of the reasons I left Facebook, maybe private life should remain what it is, private.<p>His quote about society is absolutely beautiful.<p>&quot;It would be like suddenly subtracting the strong nuclear force from the universe; the fabric of society would instantly evaporate, every marriage, friendship and business partnership dissolved.

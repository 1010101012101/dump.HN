928460,comment,927724,927782,0,0,ahlatimer,,,"I don't think you have much to worry about if you pursue C/C++ right now. The paradigms in C++ carry over to Java and other OO languages pretty easily. When I said it's a lot easier to learn the second language after learning your first, I meant it. Once you get one language down (and I mean actually get it down), the concepts pass from one language to another fairly easily. From there, you're just learning syntax and some of the oddities of the language of your choosing. It took me probably two years to really learn Java, but I learned Python in 6 weeks. I was able to sit down and be productive in php after reading about it over a weekend. Ruby (on Rails) took me about a month to learn. COBOL was probably a week. Now I'm learning C and Assembly without really being taught much C and Assembly, just the concepts behind them that differ from what I'm used to. My point is, I stuck with Java for two years until I really got my head around it, then I moved on to other languages with relative ease. I can only imagine that becomes <i>easier</i> with time, not harder.<p>I definitely think it's a good idea to learn other languages, but what, exactly, is your goal?

This doesn't exclude the larger community - in fact, it permits the existence of a larger community to continue, and occasionally to cross over into the inner community.<p>I'm not expressing this well, on reading back over it.  But I think you're miscontruing the point.  It's not that online communities die because there are too many sub-par people; it's that that many sub-par people dilute the original community and everybody throws up their hands and finds another place.

928451,comment,927714,928077,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Wiring typically has ~100% safety margin built in, however this cannot be counted on. If your wiring takes 15A, it should in theory handle 30A safely. <i>HOWEVER</i>, any nick or sharp bend in the wiring can increase resistance in the wiring, or even worse decrease the electrical resistance of the cable insulation. Heat also amplifies this problem, so an overloaded wire handling 30A in the cold of a Siberian winter might not handle it in a sweltering summer.<p>The safety margin is there for safety, just like how skydivers have a reserve chute, it doesn't mean you should rely solely on your reserve day after day.<p>Personally I would never overload house wiring, it's just not worth the risk. However I do occasionally overload extension cords (they have the same ~100% safety margin) for certain quick tasks where the cable doesn't heat up, but I'd certainly never push a 15A cable to 30A . . . I got close to something similar, a 14A appliance on a 8A extension because I was a moron and didn't read the label.<p>Also it's good to note that, not all cabling or extensions have the 100% safety margin, this margin is in place so that any defective products should still meet the <i>minimum</i> requirement.",1257635637

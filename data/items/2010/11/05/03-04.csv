Compared to an event-driven architecture, a loop is always running, with each iteration consuming CPU even if there is no real work to do that iteration. I had a brief foray as a Flash programmer and noticed this pattern in some of the codebases I saw, and in what the Flash IDE seems to push. Not sure how widely spread it is, or done any measurements on impact, however. But it has the potential to contribute to the CPU sponging the Flash browser plugin is notorious for. Take this effect, multiple it by many little Flash apps per tab, many tabs, many windows, and it can add up.",1288929193

Stephen and I are both concerned that we'll fail to sell our product ourselves.<p>This is THE major issue that we will have to face over the coming few months. Once we have a repeatable sales model, I doubt we will want to sell the business unless the offer is very attractive for us.<p>There is definitely a price point at which we would just go ""sure, its yours!"" and a lesser point where we have to get the terms we want. Stephen and I love making things, so we're more likely to go where the interesting challenges are.<p>Did that answer your question?<p><i>How did you get a sense of your value?</i><p>Once we realized how central our device was to our potential investor's plans, it started to feel like we really could be a BIG THING on our own. Facing the potential of dropping Gridspy made us really think about how much it meant to us, how much it had cost to develop and how much it could potentially be worth.<p>There is a certain value to Gridspy that is our contracting rate multiplied by the number of hours that we have worked. Add on to that the investments we have made in R+D, external contractors, hardware, etc. That is the ""Cost Price"" of the company. We know exactly how many dollars this is.<p>Somewhere between cost price and ""LOTS"" is a realistic price for Gridspy. Stephen and I set a price that I still believe is too low, a price that is increasing every day while we lower the company's risk and gain traction.<p><i>Characteristics of the offer that are red flags</i><p>This is a dangerous question to answer because it goes into more detail about the offer than I would like to go.<p>However, I can say that our purchaser was expecting things to move extremely fast after the purchase, essentially a death-march from day one. I wasn't looking forward to that particularly much.<p>Just like getting VC, you need to choose someone you will be happy working with for some time.<p>Now that we are back into the swing of things with Gridspy, I imagine that we'd ask for more from our next potential purchaser. We have built a pretty cool platform and I believe that we have a lot to offer the market over the next couple of years. Life is really good right now.",1288927212

My father put my in Judo when I was 4,  jiu-jitsu and Taekwondo by 6. While there are some Karate styles that have become obsolete with more contemporary arts surpassing them (Kempo comes to mind). I believe that Taekwondo is still a very relevant art even for combat.<p>Taekwondo while extremely difficult due to the technical kicking requirements is by far the most superior kicking art. The problem is that it is not a rounded art. In combat you cannot rely on the fact that you will land the kick ever time and Taekwondo does not really focus on that fact, it has to be augmented with another art. Which usually in Taekwondo schools is Hapkido. The problem is Hapkido is inferior to Aikido or jiu-jitsu.<p>That being said, my son is now 4 and the first art I enrolled him in was Taekwondo. Doing so will allow him to develop superior kicking technique which take the body the longest time to develop and some people after aging are never able to achieve the limberness required to master Taekwondo.<p>I agree with you to the extent that Taekwondo on it's own does not round a person enough to be confident in a street fight. But as an augmentation to other arts it will give you superior leg work over any other art and is very relevant to modern street combat. In the few altercations, that I could not avoid getting into, 2 where ended by a single kick and both where head kicks that are only taught in Taekwondo, so it is effective you just cannot rely on it as your only weapon.",1288926412

It has a very low barrier to entry (you get to spar on your first day) and nearly infinite variations on a small set of moves.<p>A really cool thing about it is that, unlike most martial arts, it's not attribute based (eg: boxing, were you need speed and strength and weight) that it's possible to see 125lb players going against 205lb opponents and winning (or at least surviving)<p>It's very pragmatic, all the mystical components have been stripped out (it's actually a disadvantage in BJJ); in my opinion, the only other martial art that could go toe-to-toe with a BJJ practitioner would be a Muay Thai fighter - but then if the fight goes to ground (which is almost a given for almost any fight) then it's over.<p>BJJ is akin to playing Chess.",1288926255

Also, Python has classes where Lua really does just have pure tables with hooks (""metatables"", which make it easy to implement prototypes, classes, and many other constructs).",1288926225

There are useful lessons in Muay Thai and hard American kickboxing. Judo is acceptable, particularly if you are not possessed of great strength. Wing Chun's pitch sounds reasonable, but I cannot speak to its efficacy.<p>Avoid most schools of Karate (Kenpo especially), Capoeira, Aikido, Tae Kwan Do, and most of Kung Fu.<p>In any case, there are bad instructors to be found for every art.

Not a bad place to end up, by any means, but why do people think Javascript is trying to be Lisp in particular? (I know Eich was influenced by Lisp, but so were ML and Smalltalk.)<p>Sometimes I wonder if people just mean, ""Wow, Javascript is actually a really expressive, dynamic language, once you get past all the idiosyncratic DOM stuff"", but don't know enough other non-ALGOL languages to see that expressiveness isn't just a Lisp thing. Because hey, it doesn't have s-expressions, macros/static metaprogramming, an explicit compile-time phase <i>at all</i>, etc. It has much more in common with Lua or Self than Lisp. It could have been a really awesome language if the browser wars hadn't stunted its growth.",1288926025

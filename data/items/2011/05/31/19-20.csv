I remain skeptical of their tagline about better tools and better craftmen, at least as it concerns their product being the better tool.<p>I'm an avid Emacs user, so I guess I'll never understand this trend towards minimalist editors. If you want to go full-screen, you can do that in emacs (you can even get the same kind of layout and look and feel with something like darkroom mode), and most decent editors anyway. Is having features in the editor really so distracting?",1306871976

Did you claim your computer as a deduction? Other side could get that. They can get any corporate assets up to the judgement amount. If you have regular income from licensing agreements they can also get that. And so on.<p>3. Declaring bankruptcy isn't without its consequences. Senior officers of companies that declare bankruptcy can be prohibited from serving as a senior officer or founder of other/new companies.

We've seen this movie, and we don't like the way it ends.""<p>I grew up in post-communist Romania, and I've also seen this movie before. Immediately after 1990 (the fall of communism) money started losing their value. At the beginning money were losing their value by ""only"" 40-50% per year, to a maximum of ~150% inflation rate in the late '90s. It was only in the mid 2000s' that the inflation rate first dropped to single digits.<p>I can still remember reading Malthus in high-school, and about how he was saying that the middle-class people are always the worst affected by the economic crisis.

The idea that someone out to mug me and take my wallet would have a firearm pointed at me and not just their fists is, to me, quite scary. I don't know what the statistics are like for such crimes at gunpoint and while I write this I realise that this fear might well be the result of my limited exposure to American news outlets.<p>I guess my question is: is it justified or is this just my lack of experience of living in the states running amok ?",1306871643

Luckily for me, I was quick enough to react and hide away my most important item, my iPhone 4. As soon as they were gone (within 30s) I called the cops, and soon thereafter we had 5 squad cars show up. They interrogated us and made us write statements, but would not send a car after the suspects, who had fled in a direction we had indicated to them. After telling us there's no chance they'd recover our stolen stuff, they took off. We asked for a ride back to the bart station, to the police station, <i>anywhere</i> (it was night in a shady part of Oakland. We had nothing no money for a cab, and we sure as hell didn't want to walk alone around Oakland.) They just refused, saying they had ""other shit to do"" and left.<p>The fact that I got mugged at gunpoint in Oakland comes as no surprise to meI shouldn't have been there in the first place.

We don't live in an ascii world anymore, text requires all 8 bits and a variable number of bytes per character.<p>> It won't work at all if you ever have any data sources or sinks that are not UTF-8<p>So don't do that. (Or convert as necessary.)<p>> and it won't work if you actually have to treat the data as text (""match all characters that are whitespace"").<p>Wrong. Actually it works just fine.<p>> Yes, some PHP functions take binary blobs that contain UTF-8 octets and return correct-looking answers. That's all they do, though; that's handling UTF-8, not handling Unicode.<p>So? Since that's completely sufficient to do the job why do you want more?<p>> In Perl, characters are abstracted away from their character encoding.<p>Why? Why would I want to do that? Is this complexity for the sake of complexity?<p>> Your PHP method just assumes everything is UTF-8, which is simply not a safe assumption to make.<p>Yes, actually it is a safe assumption for the simple reason that the only types of strings I handle are UTF-8. In todays world there is no reason to use anything else. All other character sets are obsolete and should never be used.<p>And if you do need to handle one then convert as necessary, or define your app to handle only that character set. Programs that need to handle multiple character sets in the same applicate are extremely rare. There is no need for extreme complexity just to handle the rare case.<p>> Consider the case of binary data: if you start treating binary data like it's UTF-8 text, you break the binary data.<p>So don't do that.<p>> But change the locale to en_US.ISO-8859-1, and it doesn't work anymore.<p>So don't do that.",1306870365

But very few of those fields are asked to create products / experience for a set of users that does not have that same capacity to deal with abstract mental models.<p>Making that worse is the fact that at least in most physical systems, there are constraints on complexity and process, or established social scripts for a process.

2604008,comment,2602737,2603828,0,0,jrockway,,,"Honestly, this post leads me to believe you don't really understand how characters work, and have just gotten lucky so far.  Do you really think it's acceptable to accept input, process it, and end up with REPLACEMENT CHARACTER because your string handling got fucked up?  Sure, it's valid UTF-8, but it's the Wrong Answer.<p>Plain and simple: by not handling Unicode, you are not handling Unicode.  Echoing back UTF-8 when you get UTF-8 input is handling binary, not handling text.  Yes, I know this works for your particular application, but it not correct in general.  It won't work at all if you ever have any data sources or sinks that are not UTF-8, and it won't work if you actually have to treat the data as text (""match all characters that are whitespace"").<p>Yes, some PHP functions take binary blobs that contain UTF-8 octets and return correct-looking answers.  That's all they do, though; that's handling UTF-8, not handling Unicode.<p>In Perl, characters are abstracted away from their character encoding.  Perl strings are not UTF-8 or Latin-1 or anything; they are character strings.  That makes producing correct results much easier; if you try to write a Perl character to a file, it will say, ""hey, you can't expose characters to the outside world, you need to pick a character encoding, encode, and output <i>that</i>"".  Your PHP method just assumes everything is UTF-8, which is simply not a safe assumption to make.<p>(Consider the case of binary data: if you start treating binary data like it's UTF-8 text, you break the binary data.)<p>Also, regarding LANG, yes, that will change your terminal's encoding.  So if you take one of your UTF-8 blobs and print it when the LANG is en_US.UTF-8, it will show up.  But change the locale to en_US.ISO-8859-1, and it doesn't work anymore.  That's because you can't just print binary blobs to the terminal and expect it to interpret that as text.",1306869215

GC / refcounting or manual memory management?<p>How are you implementing bind() and currying in a compiler? I'm targeting x86 and my approach is to make little stubs on the heap that push a single parameter, then i can throw them around as ordinary function pointers (lambda lifting every single parameter rather than looking up things through environment pointers at runtime). The problem with this is that i end up with a huge amount of small fixed-size objects on the heap, which is a little less than ideal but at least i can write a special allocator for that case.<p>EDIT: Upon a little background reading (and your illuminating february blog post on concatenative languages) i realise you're probably referring to Kitten, in which case i'm not sure any of my current questions are remotely applicable.",1342508363

The server is perfectly justified in sending different content based on the session identifier, so wouldn't a proxy have to assume it would?<p>But if you want to say the result doesn't depend on cookies, can't you just set a Vary header?<p>> It is trivial to write a module for apache which simulates cookies for old HTTP/1 web-apps: Simply store/look up the cookies in a local database table, indexed by the session-id the client provided.<p>Eh... okay.

4254484,comment,4254287,4254438,2,0,tanglisha,,,"Women and men are raised differently.  Things that come natural to you, having been raised male, do not come naturally to a large number of women.  Examples include how to make eye contact in an interview and how to shake hands properly.  It is very common for women to be raised with an attitude of quietly waiting to be noticed, rather than pointing out their good traits and skills.  This can leave them a bit lost when it comes to an interview, which is essentially the time to brag.<p>Aside from childbirth itself, women are far more likely to be single parents than men are, and are normally the ones to stay home with sick children, especially when there is a long-term disease involved.<p>Many women end up dealing with multiple name changes, across degrees and sometimes projects.<p>Of course not all women lack these skills, we would never pretend that to be the case.  But the ones that do are at a distinct disadvantage, and there are more of them out there than you realize.<p>Who would you turn to if you didn't even know that your handshake felt like a dead fish and you never once made eye contact with the hiring manager?

As both an open-minded and scientifically minded skeptic, it would be intellectually dishonest - even foolish - to deny that something extraordinary is going on that is worthy of investigation by science. While most cases can be explained away, about 5% of the cases deserve further study. For example, there are well documented cases of objects spotted moving at speeds of 20 or 30,000 miles per hour and making right angle turns and other impossible maneuvers, backed by both air and ground radar readings, and dozens of eyewitnesses. Or of  massive objects the size of a football field gliding at low speeds, with no sound at all,  over an entire city, and observed by hundreds of people.

So a jumbo jet or even an LCD TV would seem absurd to someone living as recently as 200 years ago. So what could a species that is millions of years ahead of us, do is hard to fathom, let alone put limits on. The funny thing is most scientists on the one hand do accept that the universe must be teeming with life. What they just cannot accept is that it maybe be visiting planet earth. Why not? The standard argument is that the speed of light places limits on how far one can travel, the nearest star being 4 light years, it would take thousands or millions of years to travel the distance (the FTL argument). And yet the very same scientists, advance theories of wormholes, 10-dimemsional space-time, alternate universes that may exist right next to us.

Please feel free to downvote if my expectations are wrong)<p>While I can completely agree with the technical merits of this proposal, there are some very two-faced statements.<p>Author begins by pointing out the painfulness of IPv4 to IPv6, says that the next HTTP upgrade should be <i>humble</i>. But then proceeds to kill cookies and remove all the architectural problems in HTTP. Isn't that the same what IPv6 was? Wouldn't such an approach produce the same amount of pain to the implementors (that is us, the web developers)?<p>Any upgrade will certainly have some backward-incompatible changes. But if it is <i>totally</i> backward incompatible, I don't understand why it still needs to be called HTTP. Couldn't we just call it SPDY v2 instead, or some other fancy name?<p>Cookies are a problem. But the safest way to solve that problem is in isolation. Try to come up with some separate protocol extension, see if it works out, throw it away if it doesn't. But why marry the entire future of HTTP with such a do-or-die change?<p>I blindly agree with the author that SPDY is architecturally flawed. But why is it being advocated in such big numbers? Even Facebook (deeply at war with Google) is embracing it. It's because SPDY doesn't break existing applications. Just install mod_spdy to get started. But removing cookies? What happens to the millions of web apps deployed today, which have $COOKIE and set_cookie statements everywhere in the code? How do I branch them out and serve separate versions of the same application, one for HTTP/1.1 and another for HTTP/2.0?<p>More doubts keep coming... Problem with SPDY compressing HTTP headers? Use SPDY only for communication over the internet. Within the server's data center, or within the client's organization - keep serving normal HTTP. There are no bandwidth problems within there. Just make Varnish and the target server speak via SPDY, that is where the real gains are.<p>I could go on. I'm not trying to say that the author's suggestions are wrong. They are important and technically good. But the way they should be taken up and implemented, without pain to us developers, doesn't have to be HTTP/2.0.

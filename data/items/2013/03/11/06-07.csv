I think Apple will push the security message against 'open source' to get their product across the line. Plus they do work a little more simply, so less training required.<p>Androids 'cheap' will let them win Education. The simple fact that if a school uses Apple products there will always be a few parents battering the principles door saying why do I have to buy this <i>insert apple product</i> when I can but an <i>insert android product</i> at 30% less.<p>And somewhere in there is Windows Mobile for enterprise if they get it right and a million other factors I don't know, don't exist yet or just make up the grey shades in my point I didn't bother to include...<p>Tl:dr Article is not worth reading but the tittle does initiate an interesting conversation as to what are the levers that drive businesses to choose their tech.",1362982955

I can program, but I'm not a ""programmer"" by any means, and it's clear to see in whatever client I work with (I'm a Big 4 Management Consultant, sorry), coding skills are becoming increasingly relevant. Macro skills are the tip of the iceberg, some industries such as investment banking and engineering practically require programming skills to find a job, as the previous poster stated. Sure they can write the requirements for an application, but mostly these are not applications, these are ad-hoc, on the fly, limited use models that need to be made and altered in time with market fluctuations or environmental conditions - far quicker than monolithic IT departments can respond (even with agile work teams).<p>I don't really care which way you phrase it, whether you see the programming as incidental or the job function as incidental is just a matter of perspective. The fact is, programming (or at least ""soft"" programming skills such as VB and SQL) are becoming increasingly essential for many of the top tier jobs in today's economy.

There's nothing I rather be doing instead of being with my child; there's no nagging in the back of my mind anymore telling me to go read some more, to come up with the next big thing, to hack something out, to work out math problems.<p>I still enjoy doing constructive activities, but it's no longer my life's purpose. For me, it's like seeing the 'big picture' of life. I remember, like the author, being extremely impatient with family life and social activities because I would rather be spending time building something, learning something new. Normal human activities seemed boring and purposeless. I made a promise to myself that I would never have a family for the fear of being too draining and becoming frustrated for not having enough time for my projects. All of that vanished in a couple of weeks after meeting my now wife's kid.<p>The kid I'm responsible for is not my biological child, so it's not just the instinct of caring for my own child that's at play here.<p>Perhaps that's why the most important scientific discoveries come before scientists have kids; it's not the responsibility and the time suck that impede growth, it's an overwhelming feeling of happiness and indescribable feeling of ""doing the right thing"" that rearing a child brings.<p>I honestly thought that child rearing distracted and frustrated parents because they HAD to become selfless. It doesn't feel that way at all. Self-growth seems superficial and meaningless now in the grand scheme of things, and I am a pretty ambitious and obsessed person.",1362982008

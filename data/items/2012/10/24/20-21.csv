One can save time and energy by reducing the unnecessary noise out of the system.<p>But I don't think same applies to HN if your work and your world revolves around the same field.

It seems odd to me that Facebook is allowing you to build a fan base while promoting their product but then charging you to reach them.  Sure, I could go to their fan page but as a Facebook user, I like them so that I do not have to go to that fan page.<p>For example, if my Crossfit box posts a new WOD everyday, I would greatly prefer to have that in my news feed rather than having to go search out the fan page again.  I could have just gone to their actual web site.<p>It would be very nice if you could use the search box to search on your news feed posts.

4695011,comment,4694776,4694974,11,0,codewright,,,"C or C++ are still (depending on background) the systems languages of first-resort for things like writing a database or an operating system. The exception to the former is usually Java depending on ecosystem and the programmers involved. (Cassandra, et al)<p>No-compromise performance still happens with C and C++. Secondarily Fortran and Ada for their respective industries. I doubt that'll change anytime soon as I'm not seeing any languages that are choosing the same priorities. Go isn't a systems language by any measure or estimation in design or implementation, and Rust is a type-safety-centric compromise that will likely end up somewhere around Java in performance. I'm not seeing much indication from the mailing list that safety-off all-go performance is a priority for the Rust devs because they seemed to favor avoiding the quagmire of a large C++ codebase.<p>I think realistically a ""clean start"" of C++ with the best of C++11 and earlier standards but removing a lot of the less worthwhile features would go a long way. Won't happen though. A lot of people avoid those problems by just writing C. Missing out on the cool reference counted pointers and compile-time stuff though.<p>Any language that wants to <i>fully</i> replace C/C++ has to embrace ""pay only for what you use"". Mandatory <i>anything</i> at runtime at the language design level is untenable.",1351112217

She estimated that the \n  Ikarian diet, compared with the standard American diet, might yield up to four \n  additional years of life expectancy. \n</code></pre>\nOh boy, 4 years.<p>Eureka. You've done it. You've found the secret to eternal life.<p><pre><code>  She also pointed out a preliminary study of Ikarian men between 65 and 100 \n  that included the fact that 80 percent of them claimed to have sex regularly,\n  and a quarter of that self-reported group said they were doing so with \n  good duration and achievement. \n</code></pre>\nIf you had asked me the same question in middle school, I would have said that I was having all sorts of sex too.<p><pre><code>  Although unemployment is high  perhaps as high as 40 percent  most\n  everyone has access to a family garden and livestock, Parikos told me.\n  People who work might have several jobs. Someone involved in tourism,\n  for example, might also be a painter or an \n  electrician or have a store. \n</code></pre>\nThis is a common pattern in the very poor. When you don't have any savings, you can't afford any interruptions in your income stream. Consequently, they're forced to be jacks of all trade, master of none. This makes it impossible to specialize in any one field, and lack of income means they can't make any capital investments.<p><pre><code>  ""When everyone knows everyone elses business, you get a feeling of \n  connection and security.

In a tiny population (one island) a handful of exceptions (164 people over 90) massively affects the average lifespan.

I've worked at software companies for the past 5 years and have spent most of my waking life in front of a computer screen.

You're just a user.</i> and 2) <i>You agreed to let them change their services without your consent when you signed up for your account.</i><p>To the first: most of us may not be their customers, but there's clearly an exchange of value going in both directions. I give them my attention, demographic information, etc. which is valuable to them as it then allows them to charge their customers for access to me and my info, in all the various ways. In return, I get access to FB and all that goes with it... but I'm not just a <i>user</i> I'm a <i>supplier</i>.

That matters <i>a lot</i> from a legal standpoint. They're clear to do whatever they want, legally, within reason.

That's the stuff that brand equity is made up of  and the brand promise, the value to users is the ability to keep up with their friends and know that their friends can keep up with them.<p>FB has begun to renege on that promise  and as such, they'll lose brand equity and the value in the eyes of their users.<p>Call it a bait and switch or don't, but the effect is still the same.",1351111685

But even that is a stretch to claim being an advantage over not being broke.<p>This is the kind of advice that leads mediocre founders to romanticize ramen-noodles and cheapskate their talent - either getting second tier people or trying to cajole talented engineers into taking much-below-market rate wages.<p>Obviously it's better for founders to be capital efficient and keep costs low.  Being hungry clearly is necessary to success.

Most of the time a page is liked when a friend of the user shares a post from the page that the user finds interesting, it may be a kitten image, funny joke, a post about your favorite movie/actor, or about a good food on a restaurant etc. Number of pages he likes depends on how much he uses Facebook. If he is moderately active the number of pages he likes would certainly reach 3 digit number. Now imagine 15 posts per day from each of the pages! It is definitely annoying. Now you are saying about ""Most Popular"" setting, on which criteria will you define a post belongs to popular category? Recommendation engine is a hard problem.

Of all the points you listed I think the most important for me is ""MySQL is well understood, which makes looking after it quite easy"". Personally I think that our analytics requirements can be satisfied by at least half a dozen different systems out there, so management, optimisation and maintenance will be major factors. For my part, these are my thoughts on the systems we've looked at:<p>1. Riak: K/V stores are conceptually simple, secondary indexes look nice, and the consensus from RICON was that scaling by adding nodes pretty-much Just Works. However, no-one at RICON seemed to use MapReduce, particularly not for real-time analytics. No SQL-like querying.<p>2. HBase: Built on popular technologies. Amazon provides it as a service, but altogether it's very complex (a lot of components, and we're not a Java shop) and we have had trouble achieving the performance we need - although it seems from various blogs and books that it must be possible.<p>3. Hypertable: Still testing it, hard to find much information about it outside of the main site.<p>4. Postgres: Everyone knows and loves Postgres. Scaling (and performance after scaling) are concerns - we might have to go down the sharding route, and may never be able to store raw events data as it comes in.<p>Haven't looked at Cassandra yet, but most likely will do that soon.",1351109425

This supposedly prevents them from taking the fifth, because they can't incriminate themselves. That smells like an attempted end run around the constitution.<p>This is pretty standard and has been for (at least) decades.  The constitutional injunction is against <i>self</i> incrimination.  You can be forced to testify against others, and a whole lot of people have been thrown in jail over the years for refusing to do so.<p>>Freedom of speech must include the freedom to remain silent.<p>Why would you think that?<p>>Fourth amendment protections against search and seizure should apply as well.<p>This is beyond weak as a constitutional argument.",1351108903

EDIT: immunity granted by the court, rather than offered by prosecutors.<p>And they quote one of the parties complaints about the time when the GJ was set up without mentioning whether it was set up specially or just in line with the normal calendar schedule. The jury in a trial is specially convened for that case. Grand juries typically sit for several months at a time and issue indictments on whatever happens to come before them. They're completely different from trial juries.",1351108821

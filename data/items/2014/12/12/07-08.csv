A big part of the reason is their comp packages. Salaries are average, bonuses way below avg, and they don&#x27;t give any equity incentives (even ESPP) to anyone below VP level. I W-2ed about 5-7% more than my base salary. Compare that to Intuit, right down the highway in San Diego, where I made ~50% more than my base once my options and RSUs started kicking in along with a 25% bonus plan.",1418371008

8738971,comment,8732891,8738916,0,0,hyc_symas,,,"I stated up front that I am totally biased. I provided multiple links backing up my statements. Nothing I&#x27;ve said here is unfounded.<p>The only FUD here is advertising a piece of software as a high performance embedded database when in fact it&#x27;s not suitable for such use <i>on its own</i>. The most viable use cases the authors have presented is when using MDBM as part of a larger distributed system such that the loss of a single DB instance isn&#x27;t fatal. The above comment talks about restoring from a log, but the actual log mechanism isn&#x27;t part of MDBM. I.e., MDBM is incomplete on its own and you must provide additional pieces in order to use it effectively.<p>I&#x27;m not solely interested in promoting my own DB. If you read the On-Disk microbenchmarks I linked you&#x27;ll see that there&#x27;s a broad range of use cases where LMDB gets trounced by LevelDB and other LSMs. I&#x27;m interested in facts.<p>From the original link:<p>&quot;On clean shutdown of the machine, all of the MDBM data will be flushed to disk. However, in cases like power-failure and hardware problems, it’s possible for data to be lost, and the resulting DB to be corrupted. MDBM includes a tool to check DB consistency. However, you should always have contingencies. One way or another this is some form of redundancy…&quot;<p>The fact is, this is a system that can lose data on a crash and it doesn&#x27;t include its own recovery mechanism. Without such a mechanism you can&#x27;t call it a persistent data store because MDBM <i>by itself</i> is not persistent.",1418370817

They even raised their eyebrows at me a bit. Really embarrassing. Like you, I whipped out my text editor after the fact and did it in a few minutes, just to prove to myself that I could. But I also made sure to carefully go over my understanding of linked lists, to really bake it into my memory, because I knew similar questions would come up again. It helped.<p>When you&#x27;re in an interview, you lose the ability to hold a lot of things in your working memory.

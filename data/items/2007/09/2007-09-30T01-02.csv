61185,comment,61017,61017,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Here is my perspective as an iPhone owner. I'm not too familiar with the details of the unlocking process but as far as I can tell if you have third party apps running on your phone the phone will need to be re-activated after installing the update (as I thinkthe phone gets wiped in the process). It makes sense to me that since unlocking modified some internal state of the phone the re-activation might break. I don't think it's apple's job to resolve bugs baused by third party hackers. I'm not even sure this disabling is intentional.<p>The same thing applies to third party apps. Why should Apple go to the trouble to make sure the upgrade doesn't break third party apps? If you're brave enough to hack your phone you have to take certain risks. If you decide to unlock the phone then don't upgrade until someone figures out how to work around this.<p>And for all the complaining of locked phones, Apple had to make some deals with AT&T for the phone to work the way it does. AT&T had to upgrade it's EDGE network, it had to build support for visual voicemails and allow for users to activate their iPhones (and sign up for service using iTunes). I can only imagine all of these changes required a lot of money to implement and as such it doesn't sound unreasonable to ask for an exclusivity deal in return. If you want a phone that work internationally go buy a Blackberry (the blackberry is a much better phone in my opinion, the only thing the iPhone does much better, and the deciding factor for me, was the web browser).",1191117144

Period.  Regardless of the years of experience in those other languages....<p>I did love programming, though... even though I was so Blubby.  As long as I wasn't pushing the limits of the languages, I wouldn't think to look anywhere else.  I didn't quite imagine that real Computer Science (like SICP) could benefit me-- given how atrocious so many programmers I'd met that had even Master's Degrees were....  Now I feel like I've wasted years and years of time.<p>(Why didn't anyone tell me?  Ah... but would I have paid attention if they tried?)",1191115153

61180,comment,61174,61174,0,0,cstejerean,,,"I'm not sure if I agree with the idea that everything must be built out of tiny fully tested pieces. On the other hand writing a large system without testing components is insane. But most of the time I find it easier to start writing a module and then start a test and debug cycle when I'm done. I might find out half way through that the original way I wanted to solve the problem was wrong and have to rewrite most things from scratch. So it's best to write things quickly and be able to throw it away quickly. After you settle on the structure you can start to write tests to check edge cases, and verify correctness (and also to help with refactoring). I'd say this style is more like ""sketch, correct, sketch some more, then polish""",1191114722

Actually you probably waste more time since it is not 3g. I have an iPhone and I enjoy being able to carry one less thing around, but when I am overseas its just annoying to not have it be unlockable (which as far as I know is a unique ""feature"" to the iPhone as every other phone - whether released under an exclusive contract or not - is unlockable)",1191114371

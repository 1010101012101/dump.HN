I'd probably rather go fishing with Joe the Plumber than Nigel the Physicist.<p>The point is that the world really needs essentially everyone to have a baseline education, the ability to contribute to their communities, and the skills to be gainfully employed or self-employed.<p>The world has a much smaller need in the grand scheme of things for advancement in theoretical astrophysics.

2430264,comment,2430207,2430207,1,0,nostrademons,,,"All of the data presented here is consistent with the hypothesis of ""pure dumb luck"".<p>You would expect to see more answers like ""My wife taught me everything I know about interpersonal skills"" and ""I never make an important business decision without consulting her"" from the highly successful group, because they are the ones who make important business decisions and believe they <i>have</i> interpersonal skills.  They get that exterior validation from their outward success.  People who are only moderately successful presumably would be less comfortable crediting their mediocre success to their wife, so they answer with the little things that their wife does for them, like cleaning their shirt.<p>Similarly, the ""propensity for creating value in non-obvious ways"" may also reflect hindsight bias.  People tend to get credited for their successes, and then rise to the level of the organization that their successes merit.  Now imagine that two mid-level managers take identical risks, except that manager A's risk pans out and manager B's does not.  Manager A will be thought of as a creative, original thinker and get promoted, but manager B will still be thought of in terms of his other successes, which were probably more ho-hum.  If you look at the top executives, <i>of course</i> they're going to seem like they create value in creative, original ways, because that was how they got promoted in the first place.",1302465387

Obviously something went wrong in this case (I believe ""jockey"" is the part that does this). Yet unaware that this feature exists, the user goes off onto the internet and downloads and installs drivers themselves.<p>I have to repeatedly tell people new to Ubuntu ""If you're downloading stuff to install from the internet then 99% of the time you're going in the wrong direction"". I was disappointed to see that Firefox 4 prompts for that kind of activity if you attempt to download with Ubuntu, rather than suggest a PPA. Though Canonical should really have systems in place for this. I believe they've been working on it and with Mozilla's faster release pace hopefully it's all hooked up.<p>Relatedly, my father just installed Ubuntu by himself the other day.

The housing situation is also quite different... What doesn't change all that much though are transport prices (although, as soon as you go to a place with only JR and no competition prices are much higher) and every day items... All in all, I think for the same quality of life in Tokyo than in Kyoto, one would need maybe 30-40% more wage...<p>That said, I agree with you on wages, I was quite surprised at how low the salaries in Japan are. Young employees just don't get paid much no matter their level of education, their productivity or their usefulness to the company...

2430245,comment,2429601,2430072,4,0,rgraham,,,"Further academic education is useful for a subset of individuals. Many people would have a larger positive effect on themselves and others with the addition of skills (a trade, electrician, plumber, mason, ...) and experiences you rarely see in a four year higher education institution. Most academic learning can be gained with a library card and a discussion partner. This leaves aside the question of financial value to the type of education they are pursuing.<p>I also disagree that you can't be an expert in multiple fields. People that love learning can advance to that status in several fields in a lifetime if they wish. Expertise is also somewhat relative and often quite limited.<p>I think a highly specialized society has great benefits for economies of scale and intense utilization of comparative advantage, but I also think a lot of people would be happier if they slowed down and had greater breadth. Physical work and tangible achievement through self reliance is phenomenally rewarding. Much freedom is gained in breadth of experience.<p>""A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly.

At the very least they are loosing revenue (especially since this stuff isn't something people will actually find in a normal store) most likely they are training future pirates.",1302462191

Hence trying it out was simple and I got hooked.<p>At that time IMO the other libraries apart from YUI, did not seem to have everything in place to learn how to use them quickly. I was put off YUI at the time because it seemed incredibly verbose, this has since been improved.<p>Also I think a distinction can be made between using jQuery and using the widget factory which does allow for more modular maintainable code.",1302462173

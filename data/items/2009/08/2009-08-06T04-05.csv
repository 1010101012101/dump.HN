Fair enough, but the time frame and  the value judgements therein are just ridiculous FUD, even if you consider that this type of prediction is always goign to have errors. A few points, off the top of my head:<p>1) Nokia had a touch screen phone (in addition to the tablets) years before iPhone, and released another in 2008 (5800 XpressMusic) and a third this year (N97, which the article mentions but which somehow seems not to count).  TFA says first Nokia touch screen phones ""with crude, unusable software"" are due in 2011.<p>2) TFA claims that first devices comparable to the first iPhone would ship in 2014, and makes a snide remark about how competetive such a device would be then. This is, of course, a completely ignorant premise: Nokia's top models are, and always have been, technically ahead of the iPhone. If Nokia gets iPhone's usability in 2014, why would that come at the cost of losing their edge in tech?",1249534227

If you search through old games, you'll eventually come across one where black starts without an f pawn.<p>There's also a famous Capablanca game where a young Capablanca is given a queen by his opponent (he wins, of course.)<p>I'd say the two biggest problems with chess are:<p>1.  Too many draws.<p>2.  First move has too big an advantage.<p>Neither of these is a problem in Go (draws are extremely rare or even impossible in many rule sets, and the second player is now given enough points that the game is almost even.)<p>I like both games a lot.

As opposed to, people who make only occasional, minor contributions to well-established projects, or just toss up random code snippets on a blog, never to be updated again.<p>I am not at all criticizing the value of these other forms of contributions to open-source.  But I am skeptical that an interviewer could draw useful conclusions when reviewing someone's open-source contributions if they are minor.  To examine the points of the article:<p>1. ""Knowing how well they write code"": If they <i>aren't</i> a chief maintainer of a project, it's not really that easy to tell which random contributions are theirs.  You need some fairly large and organized example, for this to be a practical review.<p>2. ""Knowing how to patch"": I don't think the vast majority of projects have to deal with this situation.  So while it is useful experience, it doesn't seem <i>more</i> likely that someone in the open-source world would have that experience.<p>3. ""Passion"": Again, most people aren't going to be deeply passionate about contributing 1 or 2 pages of code to a 10-year-old project that has thousands of revisions.  The people who <i>will</i> be passionate are the ones who wrote the thing from scratch and are improving it to this day.<p>4. ""Support"": This is actually a paradoxical case, where the people merely <i>using</i> open-source software (and having never seen the code) may be more qualified to support software over time, than the developers.  This is because developers spend their time, well, developing, and would be overwhelmed if significant time was just support.  Plus, see #3, how many people would be passionate about a project that is a support burden?<p>5.

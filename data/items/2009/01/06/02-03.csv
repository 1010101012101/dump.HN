Its a testament to how education is treated as a commodity by College Board and ETS. Academic programs don't care what your scores are. They only use them to help you get fellowships so they don't have to pay for your salary.<p>The real shame with the GRE is that it says nothing about the quality of the student.  I knew someone who just failed their qualifying exam and is getting kicked out, even though he scored a PERFECT on the GRE and had external funding.",1231210408

421512,comment,421390,421459,0,0,lsc,,,"my experience with the 'hour here and there' consulting that I did a few years back was that the marketing time is more like 1 hour marketing to 30 hours work, or better.  But then, I charged closer to 150% what I would expect salary (vs. 200-400%)  It would have worked swimmingly if I didn't have a capital-intensive side-project.  It was a pretty easy way to support myself while working two days a week or so, leaving lots of time for self-improvement.<p>I dono... maybe I would have gotten rejected more if I charged more, but I usually enjoy the technical stuff more than the marketing, so it makes sense to work two hours on technical work rather than one hour marketing and one hour technical work, if that is indeed the choice.<p>I have had the occasional client willing to pay me 4x what I would expect from a salaried gig, but I mostly lucked into those.   Some clients offered me more than I was asking, so maybe I would have done OK insisting on the higher rates.",1231209522

It's basically like acting as a compiler and finding type mismatch errors.  As for the sentence completion, the task is to memorize a set of rules, look at an input, and once again act as a compiler.  Reading comprehension is probably the most 'verbal' of the verbal questions, but once again math and CS students have the advantage here: we've been reading obtuse texts looking for the answer to a specific question for years!",1231207979

Not much money from the rich currently goes to the poor via SS (Medicaid is a different beast)<p>Now, Obama has floated the idea to remove the $100k cap, WITHOUT paying any additional benefit.

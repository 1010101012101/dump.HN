So the body rolls into position, 2 guys open the doors, the robot painter goes in and does its thing, comes out and the guys close the doors again.

I think we are capable of taking, in a few years time, advantage of most hardware. Dramatic improvements in performance thus require improving physical matrix the computation happens in. That means the prospective machine intelligence needs to have access to all the infrastructure thats needed to design and produce such matrix. It also will need to make experiments, and do things by trial-and-error, just like we do, even tho it could catch a hint easier than we do.<p>Think of chess. Seeing a couple of moves further in to the game might require 1000 times more raw computation. Such power might guarantee victory over lesser equipped competition. It still doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;d be even close to &quot;solving&quot; the game. What I mean is, &quot;intelligence&quot; is not the only requirement needed for self-improvement. In the end, it might not even be the bottleneck at all. \nFor example, suppose we are planning the next generation of a transistor for some IC. Suppose a team of humans needs to do 100 experiments to get the process right. A perfectly smart AI might still need to run 90 experiments, no matter what, because it still needs to extract the same information that humans would from those experiments.<p>The machine needs to do all the chores (of R&D) that we already are doing. I&#x27;m not saying they couldn&#x27;t be done better, but I&#x27;m saying they still need to be done, and any creature doing them still needs to spend the time and resources needed to do them. And it&#x27;s not all brainwork.\nI have no doubts vanilla humans can be outcompeted at some point. But even when human performance has been exceeded, technology might not immediately take off rocket-like to a world we cannot comprehend.<p>Still, I wonder, what the hell are we all going to do when paying the power-bills and capital costs of AI become cheaper than hiring a human..",1424893952

The main purpose of this program is to provide federal funds to perform research in order to help new small businesses grow, which in turn become large companies or get acquired by large companies.

Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, GMail, HN, the government all should allow you to easily link your identity. This should be a normal part of your account creation (this can tie in nicely with another change: getting rid of passwords and using a browser UI for identifying yourself a la Persona, but PGP based).  Basically when signing up for Twitter, it should optionally let you upload one of your public keys (via a nice browser UI no less). Twitter (Facebook, GMail, etc.) would then expose a nice API for querying by public key fingerprint: &quot;Who has 0xDEADBEEF?&quot; => &quot;@DeadBeef&quot;. Revocation, key updates, all that should be automatic: you revoke your public key and issue a replacement, all your services update automatically.<p>This is the point where lots of people will raise concerns about privacy: &quot;This means Twitter now must have access to my GMail account!

We&#x27;re big fans of JSQMessagesViewController and a number of our early access developers built their UIs on top of it. The biggest difference between Atlas and JSQMessagesViewController at the moment is that Atlas is deeply integrated with the messaging services of Layer and the programming model exposed by LayerKit, while JSQMessagesViewController is backend agnostic. This translates directly into the amount of code that you need to write in order to get your UI and messaging fully wired. It&#x27;s a trade-off -- with Atlas you write less code and have less things to coordinate within your UI, but you pick up a direct dependency on Layer. At this point there&#x27;s a fair bit of overlap in functionality between Atlas and JSQMessagesViewController, but keep in mind that this is our 1.0 release. Looking a few months down the line, we&#x27;ll be bringing a number of additional components and services online that will make the distinctions more apparent. We&#x27;re also in the process of developing Atlas for Android and Web, which will share a similar API aesthetic. Hope this is helpful and you can find the time to give Atlas a whirl!",1424892664

Start writing an Identity service, and so on.<p>The only difference is that instead of starting to write some Identity class and use it in your Game service, you write some Identity class and expose it via a REST API, and then provide an interface library that interfaces with that REST API. Call it IdentityInterface or libidentity or something. Pydentity, whatever. It makes an HTTP request, gets a serialized object, unserializes it, and returns it.<p>For simplicity, put all your public models in that library, and it gets shared by both the Identity service and the Game service. Those models represent an object and what you can do with it. In the Identity service is where all of that actually happens.<p>This is also how you solve the &#x27;multiple microservices at the same time&#x27; problem; your interface library provides the public interface, and the backend REST API is the &#x27;private&#x27; API used by the public interface. You make changes to the backend API and the public library and no one notices, or you make incompatible changes to the public service and fix everything before you deploy; ideally, you add new APIs, migrate services over, then deprecate the old ones.<p>In the end, each service sees the world as fundamentally the same; there&#x27;s a library with classes and functionality, and you use that to do things.

We&#x27;re instinctively wired to worry about our resources and like to think their value is universal. It&#x27;s based on the assumption that even for non-human organisms, the Earth is the end-all-be-all prize. Nobody seems to question this assumption, so I will.<p>I posit there is nothing, nothing at all on Earth that couldn&#x27;t be found in more abundance elsewhere in the galaxy. Also, Earth comes with a few properties that are great for humans but bad for everybody else: a deep gravity well, unpredictable weather and geology, corrosive atmosphere and oceans, threats from adaptive biological organisms, limited access to energy and rare elements.<p>There may well be reasons for an antagonistic or uncaring intelligence to wipe us all out, and an unlimited number of entities can be imagined who might do so just for the heck of it, but a conflict over resources seems unlikely to me. A terrestrial SMI starved for resources has two broad options to consider: sterilize the planet and start stripmining it, only to bump up against the planet&#x27;s hard resource limitations soon after - or launching a single rocket into space and start working on the solar system, with a clear path to further expansion and a greatly reduced overall risk.<p>One other thing I&#x27;d like to comment on is this idea that an SMI has to be in some way separate from us. While it&#x27;s absolutely possible for entities to develop that have no connection with humanity whatsoever, I think we&#x27;re discounting 99% of the rest of the spectrum. It starts with a human, moving on to a human using basic tools, and right now we&#x27;re humans with advanced information processing. I do not have the feeling that the technology I live my daily life with (and in) is all that separate from me. In a very real sense, <i>I</i> am the product of a complex interaction with my brain as the driving factor, but including just as essentially the IT I use.<p>When discussing SMI, this question of survival might have a shades-of-grey answer as well. To me, survival of the human mind does not mean &quot;a continued, unmodified existence of close-to-natural humans on Earth&quot;. That&#x27;s a very narrow-minded concept of what survival is. I think we have a greater destiny open to us, completing our long departure from the necessities of biology which we have begun millennia ago. We might fuse with machines, becoming SMIs or an integral component of machine intelligences. I think this is a worthwhile goal, and it&#x27;s an evolutionary viable answer to the survival problem as well. It&#x27;s in fact the only satisfying answer I can think of.",1424892452

I honestly have no idea what version I have installed what with the new UI) does a horizontal page-turn animation when viewing documents.  It literally makes me nauseous, and I don&#x27;t see any way to turn it off without entering document edit mode.  Android&#x27;s Camera app now starts up, shows the control buttons (video, camera), then animates them off the screen.  They&#x27;re not shown long enough for you to press one unless you&#x27;re gunning for it, and you can&#x27;t pull them back on screen until the animation finishes.  Lollipop in general has a bunch of animations which exist solely for the sake of animations.  If I pull a menu out, I want to immediately start using it, not wait for the slick, deceleration of the animation to finish before I can begin interacting.<p>It all reminds me of Vista&#x27;s Aero interface.

Generally speaking, this will probably not be a problem for a free-market economy, although it will certainly result in some unemployment.<p>The key point is that replacing humans with machines does not only cause unemployment, but it also reduces cost of production, which stimulates capital investment and/or reduces prices in the industry in question. In the general economy, this reduced cost and increased production should offset the lost &quot;purchasing power&quot; from the now-unemployed parties. The stimulus reduces costs in other industries which promotes job growth.<p>The end result is likely to be that the same number of people are employed, but they are employed in a more efficient manner of production. The cost of labor will decrease relative to the amount of production, however because this is tied to a decrease in cost of production, the real value of the labor (in terms of things you can buy) should not decrease.<p>Of course there will be some disenfranchised individuals, especially those who have particular skills that are replaced my mechanization. However, this is more likely to affect skilled laborers (like cooks) than those who are not paid for their skills (like janitors or cashiers).<p>In the end, I guess my point is that a free-market economy naturally balances these factors due to the relationship between supply and demand. However, it&#x27;s possible that we will reach a point, especially if we truly do hit a Singularity, where we will have to reconsider the use of a scarcity-based economy at all, as production becomes completely divorced from any human action.

Way back when MS was working on Windows 1.0, I was working for a start up company and we were developing network management software for SNA Networks and Mainframes. It was very advanced for the day and used a GUI but was done on Mainframe computers and terminals. The company sold out to IBM and I chose to take the money and run. A friend of mine referred me to MS because they needed people with graphics experience. So I met with one of the team leaders and went over and talked with them. At the time, Windows was very very primitive, they had not yet figured out how to make the windows overlap and re-paint (which we had figured out a long time before that). I actually felt sorry for them at the time because I just could not imagine how they would ever catch up with Apple, the Mac was just so much more advanced. It seemed to me like there was no doubt that they would be out of business in a few years completely replaced by Apple, it was just so obvious at the time to me. They offered me a job but it was less money in terms of salary than another offer I had from a Fortune 500 company, but at the time MS had a great stock option plan, but I felt that was worthless based on my brilliant analysis of their prospects. So I took the safe bet. I tell this story occasionally to younger people who are trying to decide about what to do in terms of career choices. Sometimes the wiser choice is to take the risk and follow the more exciting path. It is no guarantee of success, but neither is taking the safe choice.

Doyle (founder of Eolas) first targeted Microsoft in what would turn into a long streak of litigation; he initially approached Microsoft with an offer to license his invention.

Eolas went on to sue[3] 22 other of the largest internet companies for violating the same patent.<p>Eolas wasn&#x27;t claiming to have invented &quot;interactive&quot; computer programs in general, since this would be absurd.  Eolas simply had the foresight to be first in line to file for a patent that combined the idea of interactivity (via external programs) with the nascent technology of web browsing, which was, to my knowledge, still &quot;non-interactive&quot; in 1994.

Generics essentially operate via providing a new logical structure to types, <i>the ability to introduce and operate sensibly over type variables</i>. So I would argue that a type language without generics is much like a programming language without variables [1].

I first moved out here to work with a large tech company whose products I knew I wasn&#x27;t passionate about, but who could give me a great job with a lot of learning. Eventually, the lack of passion got to me, and I started seeking other opportunities that more closely aligned with my beliefs. A couple months ago, I left that company and joined a small startup who is building something I believe in. I think I made a wrong decision<i>. I&#x27;m confident now that I want to leave this company too, but I&#x27;m worried about what that means for my resume and what opinions future employers might form. Two jobs in under two years? I think I could explain, but I might not even get that chance. If I left this company, I have no idea what I would do next. What should I do?<p></i> The software quality here is a major step down from my last company. I expected this to a certain extent, but I&#x27;m realizing now that the difference is so drastic that I don&#x27;t even feel I&#x27;m learning or growing as a developer right now. There exists a complacency among the team with throwing code at the next task in the queue until &quot;it works&quot; and then moving on. In that regard, I feel alone in my endeavors to better the codebase, and my efforts get quickly overshadowed by the other developers because there&#x27;s no management structure for aligning on a clear path to betterment. I think the problem is actually more nuanced than complacency - I think some of the developers here truly believe they&#x27;re writing high quality solutions. I feel like an arrogant asshole for even having this opinion, but it worries me that I&#x27;m working with people who don&#x27;t know they&#x27;re just digging a deeper hole, and who will defend their ideas eternally. Maybe I&#x27;m just not good at convincing people on new ideas, but to me, that just speaks to how much more I have yet to learn, which makes me think I need to be in an environment where I&#x27;m still learning.",1424891605

NASDAQ wasn&#x27;t really independent of NASD until 2000, so for a while the same people who owned the exchange also regulated it.<p>The NYSE is much older and became a Not-for-Profit in 1971. In 2006 it merged with ArcaEx and became a publicly owned for-profit, later merging with Euronext in 2007 and acquiring AMEX in 2008.<p>Here&#x27;s the weird thing: exchanges are supposed to self-regulate, with the SEC basically just approving the rules they make for themselves. And the exchanges kind of &#x27;outsource&#x27; their regulation - but not all of it - and that&#x27;s not all that well defined anyway.<p>In 2007, NASD&#x27;s and NYSE&#x27;s regulatory and enforcement committees were merged into a new organization, FINRA, which basically makes the rules their members are supposed to abide by and enforces them in coordination with the SEC.<p>The SEC has been investigating exchanges since the &quot;flash crash&quot; of 2010, when it was shown how completely fragile the market had become by large players making very large trades, as well as new high-frequency automated trading.<p>In 2011, NYSE Euronext tried to merge with Deutsche Börse, which would have become the largest stock market in the world by far. It actually passed US antitrust investigation. But in 2012 the European Commission blocked the merger as it would have created a 93% monopoly on European derivatives trading. This doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the exchanges violating rules, but it does show how without regulation, monopolies would be a virtual certainty.<p>In 2012 NYSE was fined 5 million for giving data to its customers before the public. In 2014 NYSE was fined 4.5 million when it was found to have violated its own rules, or lacked rules it should have had.<p>Compare this to NASDAQ settling with the SEC for 10 million just for mishandling Facebook&#x27;s IPO in 2013. This is apparently because the SEC stopped short of finding the NYSE&#x27;s actions as felonies. And all of this is relatively new, as exchanges historically were never legally scrutinized or punished for their actions.

The answer to both questions is &quot;no.&quot; We both give an equal amount of unpaid time to the process to show our commitment to moving it forward.<p>Obviously marriages are reciprocal. If a company does not treat you well in the application process, that&#x27;s probably a signal that it&#x27;s not a good place to work. That company does not understand how to attract talent.<p>FutureAdvisor does not ask most software engineering candidates to complete coding challenges (when we do, it is to give someone a chance to prove their capabilities when they have fallen down elsewhere, like a makeup test). We do ask to see evidence of their work elsewhere, both on Github and in live interviews. Only performance correlates with performance. There&#x27;s no way around that.<p>In my work as a recruiter, I spend a tremendous amount of time writing emails to candidates we really want to hire. That work, like a coding challenge, is all on spec, and it often doesn&#x27;t pan out. I often feel as though I&#x27;ve wasted my time. It&#x27;s difficult to escape the strange dynamics of the job market, where goods are not substitutable, and the buyer and the seller have many idiosyncratic properties and needs that can only be communicated through ad hoc efforts like coding challenges and emails to individuals.",1424891469

There&#x27;s something to be said for the cinematographic effect low framerate+motion blur, and there&#x27;s a long history of chemical and digital post-processing techniques that take advantage of motion blur.<p>However, what works to the favor of <i>The Grand Budapest Hotel</i> doesn&#x27;t necessarily have a place in <i>The Hobbit</i>. Higher framerate is useful for enhancing the visual acuity of battle scenes and for immersion. These are not the primary goals of all movies, though.<p>As graphics technology improves, I think we&#x27;ll start to see some games opt to render at <i>lower</i> framerates. Probably not games that require split-second reaction times or any first-person games where the camera moves violently (for instance, Starcraft, Counterstrike). Games aiming for a more artistic impression, such as puzzle games (Portal, The Witness), RPGs (The Elder Scrolls), adventure games (Brothers), however, might choose to initially render at an extremely high framerate, say 240fps, and then use that data to generate true motion blur at something like 30fps.<p>We might eventually see movies shift to such a system, where they are recorded at very high framerates and arithmetically stitched together into something more traditional. This would stand to benefit remastering efforts 50 years after the initial production when better technology becomes available. But cinema has always been slow to adopt new technology: sound, color, digital, etc.",1424891383

9108752,comment,9108311,9108311,0,0,dicroce,,,"I&#x27;ve been studying machine learning lately... Here is my take:<p>Well before we create an ASI (artificial super intelligence) we will have put 90% of the human race out of work with specialized (non conscious) intelligent agents... (for example, self driving cars). I believe that this will be a disaster for our society as it exists today. My hope is that we will adapt and make the necessary societal changes so that we can reap the benefits of this technology.<p>Everyone assumes that an ASI will be able to augment itself and learn exponentially. I suspect that this will be true if the nature of the brain is defined by a single algorithm. If the brain is not defined by a single algorithm and is instead a big ball of complexity then our ASI&#x27;s will not be able to grow exponentially any more than we can (they will likely not really understand their own consciousness, just like we don&#x27;t).<p>If a single algorithm defines the brain, then I suspect humans will be able to augment their brains with machine intelligence as well. If we can augment our brains, then we&#x27;re playing the same game as the machines.<p>If it proves impossible to augment our intelligence, I suspect that an ASI would still preserve humanity if only to preserve us for future potentialities.<p>ASI are much more fit for space travel than us.\n    1) Not nearly as sensitive to radiation, so less shielding, so less fuel.\n    2) Much less stringent environmental requirements (no heating, cooling, air, food, etc.)\n    3) Ability to sleep for incredibly long periods means ASI is far more suited than us for exploring the cosmos.\nI suspect that an ASI might leave us alone simply because the universe is so vast, and entirely open to it.",1424890928

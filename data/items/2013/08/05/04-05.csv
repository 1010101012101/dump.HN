This is a much bigger problem.

6158548,comment,6158294,6158294,10,0,derefr,,,"The one tool I constantly wish for is something like Hyperdesktop (<a href=""http://gethyperdesktop.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gethyperdesktop.com/</a>) &#x27;s entry on the Windows &quot;Send To...&quot; menu: something that takes a file on your drive, pushes it anonymously to a file-hosting site (where it&#x27;ll expire as soon as people stop looking at it for a while), and then puts a link <i>directly to the file</i> on your clipboard. But, you know, for all file-types, not just images.<p>I <i>can</i> currently do this using Dropbox, but it&#x27;s rather a hassle; the quickest method I&#x27;ve found is to use the web client[1], navigate to my Public folder, drop a file onto it, wait for it to upload, then right-click -> Copy Public Link.<p>Making that one step would be wonderful. Making the link a &quot;promise&quot;[2], so I don&#x27;t have to do synchronous clipboard gymnastics when I&#x27;m trying to get multiple links at a time, would be even better.<p>Droplr (<a href=""https://droplr.com/hello"" rel=""nofollow"">https://droplr.com/hello</a>) is pretty similar to all this--but it doesn&#x27;t do direct links, so my most common usage-pattern for it (treating it as an &quot;I need a CDN to show people this image/audio/video for the next 30 seconds or so, then it can disappear&quot; service) is mooted. Dropbox also changed their service to remove Public folders for new users, with the &quot;shared files&quot; in its place having the same wrapper+HTML embedded file design.<p>Temporary hotlinking of my own content is important; I&#x27;m willing to pay for it!<p>---<p>[1] The Dropbox native client&#x27;s uploading thread is optimized for background &quot;forget about it, it&#x27;ll just be magically synced later&quot; processing, not synchronous use. The web client lets you upload as fast as your web-browser can manage.<p>[2] A &quot;promise&quot; link would be something like--if the file hasn&#x27;t finished uploading yet, figure out whether the User Agent is a human or a script/bot. If it&#x27;s a script/bot, just let their connection sit open until the file finishes (they won&#x27;t mind.) If the user-agent is human, however, immediately return a 408 (Timeout) error <i>with HTML body content</i> showing a spinner. Estimate time-to-completion plus a little bit, and put that time into an HTTP &quot;Refresh&quot; header. (Remember those?)",1375678610

If we have proven that it is impossible to disprove the continuum hypothesis, then would we be safe in assuming it to be true? If such an assumption were to lead to contradictions, we would have a proof by contradiction that the hypothesis is false. Of course, the same argument could be made for assuming the hypothesis is false. Therefore, doesn&#x27;t this demonstrate that their are 2 constructions of math we can use: one where it is true, and the other where it is false. And that both of these constructions are internally consistent (assuming that the math with neither assumption is itself consistent).  At this point it just becomes a question of which version is more useful/interesting.",1375678210

They&#x27;re starting rollout in Europe this month, and Asia later this year.<p>At the end of 2014, they will start rolling out the Model X SUV that will offer dual engines.  Some are speculating that it could give a 0-60mph time in under 4 seconds.  That would be truly incredible for an SUV.<p>Then, Tesla is readying the long-awaited GenIII vehicle due at the end of 2016 or in 2017.  Elon Musk recently stated that his goal is to sell the vehicle for $35000 (w/o incentives) and for the car to have a 200 mile range.  Further, Gen III is targeting the BMW 3 series and many are expecting the Gen III to handle and perform better than a BMW 3 series.  It could be the hottest car on the planet when it&#x27;s released.<p>Tesla as a company is doing very well.  They&#x27;re expanding like crazy.  And they&#x27;re managing their cash flow well.  They will report Q2 earnings this Wednesday, 8/7 and they could report another quarterly profit as well.<p>In another area, Elon Musk has promised to achieve 25% gross margin on the Model S by the end of the year.  So, it will be interesting to see how far they&#x27;ve come along when Q2 earnings are reported on Wednesday.  Further, it could be possible Tesla is shooting for 30% gross margin on the Model S next year (which would be incredible).

6158452,comment,6158233,6158233,5,0,Xcelerate,,,"Funny, I was thinking about this exact thing today.<p>Quantum teleportation essentially <i>is</i> teleportation as long as you avoid the philosophical issues (e.g., is a reconstructed person the same person anymore?) and just stick to the scientific questions.<p>The Bekenstein Bound is a very high upper bound on the maximum information contained within a given volume.  Black holes are maximal entropy objects, and since entropy is just the log of the number of states of a system (states = information), roughly speaking, that&#x27;s how the bound is calculated.<p>But everyday life isn&#x27;t nearly as high in entropy as a black hole, so it&#x27;s likely that the amount of information representing a person is significantly less than what the bound suggests.  However, I have doubts about whether you can actually use that bound on something that <i>isn&#x27;t</i> a blackhole.  A wavefunction (which is, theoretically, all the information necessary to completely describe a system) is a multi-particle function (more specifically, a function of a configuration space).  For example, you can talk about the wavefunction of an electron, but that&#x27;s just an approximation.  To completely describe the electron&#x27;s behavior, you need the wavefunction as a function of the electron and its surrounding particles.  The further away the surrounding particles are, the less of an influence they will have on the behavior of the electron, but the influence is still there.  So really, you&#x27;d need a wavefunction of everything extant to exactly describe the electron...  Anyway, the question of whether there is a &quot;universal wavefunction&quot; seems to be debated among physicists, and I&#x27;m not one anyway, so who knows...<p>Getting back on topic, I&#x27;ll just assume that the wavefunction of all particles constituting a person is enough information to completely specify them and proceed with that as a given.  That being the case, there is something called the &quot;no-cloning theorem&quot; that forbids the duplication of a quantum state.  So the good news is that there&#x27;s no way for teleportation to screw up and create two of you!  Quantum states can only be moved, which is what quantum teleportation is.  The problem is that this teleportation also requires a classical channel (aka an optical fiber) to complete the transfer of state.  So, you still can&#x27;t teleport anything faster than the speed of light.  Which isn&#x27;t much of a problem on earth, but you still can&#x27;t get to Pluto instantly.  This assumes of course that someone far in the future has figured out a way to quickly ascertain the quantum state of macroscopic objects, which is unlikely to ever happen.",1375676509

Bitcoins were invented in 2008 by a computer programmer who goes by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, who describes it as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.<p>The Phoenix Fund&#x27;s investment in Avalon reflects the growing popularity of virtual currencies, which are also coming under scrutiny from regulators. Other bitcoin enthusiasts include Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who are best known for their role in the creation of Facebook Inc. FB +1.50% They have proposed an exchange-traded fund that is tied to bitcoins.<p>Bitcoins are created through a process called mining, in which computers solve complex mathematical algorithms to earn the bitcoins. The total number of bitcoins that can be mined is limited to 21 million. There are now about 11.5 million bitcoins in circulation, according to Blockchain, a website that monitors bitcoin transactions.<p>The Phoenix deal will also involve Taiwanese microchip maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., 2330.TW 0.00% which is set to supply the state-of-the-art microchips that will power the hardware.<p>The Phoenix Fund was set up this year to invest in bitcoin mining-hardware companies. It looked at several of Avalon&#x27;s rivals in the sector, including Butterfly Labs and KnCMiner but decided against investing, according to a person familiar with the private-equity firm&#x27;s strategy.<p>Investors in the Phoenix Fund, which includes a small number of individuals who made their fortunes in currency trading, believe that the currency will become more stable and popular if more parties are involved in the mining process, this person said.<p>Mr. Lewis moved into currency trading in the 1980s and 1990s. In September 1992, Mr. Lewis teamed up with Mr. Soros to bet on sterling crashing out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, an event that was later named &quot;Black Wednesday.&quot; Mr. Lewis didn&#x27;t respond to a request for comment.<p>Mr. Lewis had big losses investing in U.S. brokerage firm Bear Stearns Cos, in which he began amassing a stake during 2007, The Wall Street Journal reported at the time.<p>Mr. Lewis is the main investor in an unlisted company called Tavistock Group, which has investments in more than 200 companies across the globe.<p>Tavistock Group includes ENIC Group, which has a Bahamas-registered subsidiary called ENIC International Ltd., through which Mr. Lewis owns 85% of the shares in U.K. soccer club Tottenham Hotspur.<p>The Phoenix Fund is independent of Tavistock.<p>The bitcoin deal was put together by Andrew Laurus, a former government-bonds salesman at Lehman Brothers who is also an investor in the fund. Avalon was set up by Yifu Guo, a pioneer in the bitcoin-mining industry. He was part of the team that developed the first ASIC bitcoin mining hardware. ASIC stands for application-specific integrated circuit, a type of custom-designed microchip. Mr. Guo couldn&#x27;t be reached for comment.<p>Separately, Coinflash, a company that planned to set up kiosks for bitcoin enthusiasts to buy the virtual currency, is shutting down before it even opened its doors. &quot;Due to an unforeseen change in our personal circumstances, we&#x27;ve made the difficult decision to suspend Coinflash&#x27;s services indefinitely,&quot; the San Diego-based company said in an email statement.<p>Coinflash was established earlier this year and had planned to open the bitcoin kiosks in California and New York this summer.<p>As part of the deal, Avalon will gain access to TSMC microchips based on 20-nanometer processes, which are much faster than other chips. TSMC recently won a contract to supply chips to Apple. The increased processing power should give Avalon an edge in solving the algorithms that control the supply of bitcoins.",1375676014

It is however clear that HN is attracting lot of marketers and activists. While I don&#x27;t know all the efforts going in to fend this off, the ones I know such as banning specific URLs, dead stories etc look unorganic/bruteforce as opposed to clean algorithmic solutions. One clean solution would be to simply enable downvote button and increase the expressiveness of the community. I however has no idea why HN does not have downvote button.",1375675282

This does not make me a partisan either for or against the astroturfers. If HN stories were showing up simultaneously and with the same headlines as press releases from the John Birch Society, I would direct my flamethrower in their direction.<p>And you ignored the other half of my comment, about how the NSA story <i>is not news</i>. It is merely new to excitable young people who mistake unfamiliarity for expos. If I can convice them to take the red pill, they will learn that parts of signals intelligence are profoundly more important than even the astroturf claims, and at the same time more mundane.",1375675241

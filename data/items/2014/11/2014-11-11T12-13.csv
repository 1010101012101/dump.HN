My absolute top nit-pick with that philosophy is: it doesn&#x27;t compile to an .exe/elf.<p>Using Squeak as an example, it is very-much a virtual <i></i>machine<i></i>. If I want to work on a new project, I might have to create a new VM image or something. It&#x27;s like an OS and language boiled into one thing, which simply doesn&#x27;t work.<p>There are more classical approaches to SmallTalk these days, but most of the literature on the language is oriented toward the Squeak approach; dedicating half the bloody book to working within the OS!

The films came, and I feel like my personal graphical view of this world has been ripped off and torn apart. I cannot remember how things were.<p>I am a fan of the Fondation series, and I have read it twice, and I am not looking forward to see any kind of adaptation as this will inevitably be the personal graphical interpretation of someone else.<p>Now you may argue that is it fair: this is a liberal world we are living in and if I wanted to see my graphical interpretation of it on the screen and not someone else&#x27;s, I should seek to produce it before any competitor reaches the consumers first.

Removing someone&#x27;s freedom should <i>never</i> be done lightly. In the case of Aaron Schwartz it was. I would argue that some police officers tend to default to the position of treating someone badly - not violently, but in a way that assumes their guilt, assumes that they need to be restrained, or assumes that they&#x27;re deliberately hiding something. That is completely the wrong way to do things in a civilised society.<p>Police officers should only ever act with force if they&#x27;re protecting themselves or others, and always with the absolute minimum action necessary, and they should always stop when the threat has been removed. Very occasionally that will require restraining someone and taking their shoes, but probably in far fewer cases than actually happens.

8589487,comment,8585483,8589375,0,0,latch,,,"The very point of an interface is to decouple the caller from all the implementation specifically because it will work differently between implementation. If you expect two classes to implement it the same way, you an abstract base, not an interface.<p>Close is a particularly good example. One need only look at C#&#x27;s IDisposable to see that it does, in fact, work well. A mock might noop it, another class might close an FD, and yet another might make an RPC call.<p>I agree that interfaces tend to have fairly narrow family tree. And, by this narrowness, there&#x27;s little ambiguity about what T GetById(id int) means. As the tree expands, which happens with implicit interfaces, ambiguity is more likely. Nevertheless, there&#x27;s a fairly large common vocabulary that we&#x27;d all largely agree on. Closer, Reader, Writer, Logger, etc. Even in more complex ones, I see little risk of confusion, say, http.ResponseWriter. And, something that I&#x27;ve noticed from Go (which I never did in C# or Java), is the tendency to favor very small interfaces, which ends up being pretty awesome.<p>That aside, consider that implicit interfaces allow the consumer to define the interface. For example, you create a library that has a concrete struct called MyStruct with a method called DoStuff(). You define no interface because you don&#x27;t need one.<p>I, a consumer of your library, need an interface because in some cases I&#x27;m using your MyStruct to DoStuff and in other cases, I&#x27;m using my own implementation. So I create an interface, define DoStuff(), and BAM!, your structure now implements my interface. I don&#x27;t have to change your code.<p>Sure, the workaround is to wrap your structure in my own which implements the interface. But how, in this case, is the implicit interface not a huge win?<p>Maybe, as you say, it&#x27;ll screw over people who use it poorly. For everyone else, I see no drawbacks.",1415709058

I expect that MS&#x27;s selling proposition will be around the ease of maintenance with existing know-how and better integration around virtualisation / cloud services with MS Windows.<p>One of the reasons MS is so successful within the (higher) education sector is the general risk avoidance of ITC management in these institutions (in the UK, central government wants cloud services so cloud are being implemented) and being driven by revenue-based investment vs CapEx - MS caters directly for that with their packaging and existing framework contracts already in place. One example - currently you get a US$100k StorSimple appliance from MS for free / paid soft via 1 year Azure services cost for scale-out storage service e.g. to replace shared drives (yes many universities still use them).<p>The other area where MS has done their home work is with EU Data Protection laws / DPA in the UK where they negotiated a full turn-key framework with JaNet that allows universities to be compliant without going to another 6m-1y assessment as they currently still have to do with Google.<p>Have a look at <a href=""http://linuxgizmos.com/stick-computer-runs-on-quad-core-atom/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://linuxgizmos.com/stick-computer-runs-on-quad-core-atom...</a> to see what I meant with sticks plugged into the monitor - guess these certainly can be called commodity end user devices.",1415708695

The most difficult thing to me was getting it to work even when Messages.app wasn&#x27;t started. Applescript is quite frustrating for someone who&#x27;s never dealt with it before. This was on Mavericks though, not sure if that&#x27;s still a problem on Yosemite. Does your version have problems with that?",1415707479

My understanding of net neutrality was that the source of the packet couldn&#x27;t be allowed to affect the delivery of the packet.<p>In this case, if the satellite connection is more expensive, the user will pay that higher cost.  The price is for the uplink, not depending on what bits flow across it.<p>How is that at all affected by net neutrality?",1415707426

I thought that was just how memory works.<p>You mean to say people normally remember approximately how long ago something happened? Like, not just from &quot;Ok so event X happened, and it couldn&#x27;t have happened before event Y, and Y relates to Z that I know for a fact happened in so and so year, so I think X happened D months/years ago&quot;<p>Similarly, I have never been able to remember a name, but I can always remember a face for forever. To the point that I will see random people in the street and wont&#x27; be able to tell if I only saw them once randomly in the street or I went to high school with them.<p>Remembering conversations, hah, funny. People actually remember those more than just the two or three key takeaways?<p>Funnily I can almost always remember my dreams to the point that I usually can&#x27;t tell the difference between dream memories and real memories.",1415707236

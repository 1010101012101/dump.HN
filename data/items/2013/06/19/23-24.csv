You can pretty much pick IPv6 addresses at random (under your router prefix), and you have (many many many) more addresses than the whole IPv4 address space to choose from (it&#x27;s a 128 bit address space and providers typically give a /48, /56, or /64 prefix at worst... that&#x27;s 128-64=64 bits... that&#x27;s 2^63.9999... more addresses than IPv4). In short, you don&#x27;t really &quot;map&quot; the IPv6 space the same way you do the IPv4 space.<p>Taking credit for someone else&#x27;s work very much is a useful analogy: if I can only speak through a third party, and I need that third party&#x27;s permission to speak, let alone be spoken to, I quickly resent him or her. This is quite the case with current NAT solutions, with system administrators restricting &quot;their&quot; networks, making communication difficult for everyone else (by holding the only globally-routable address or &quot;allocating&quot; only a few; everyone else <i>is</i> second-class).",1371685914

Metro&#x27;s job is to operate a transportation system, not to operate a homeless shelter, and the fact that homeless people were riding back and forth across the downtown ride free zone made it much more difficult for Metro to do its actual job.<p>It may reassure you to know that a local social services group now operates a free &quot;Downtown Circulator&quot; bus which runs in a loop around the area of the old ride free zone.

But the use of the subjunctive &quot;would have&quot; suggests--though doesn&#x27;t prove--something more.<p>Your example explains the past tense but not the subjunctive mood. For example, would one say &quot;Captain Picard would have lived many years after Captain Kirk&quot;? To use the construction &quot;would have&quot; in this way casts the event as something that could have happened, but didn&#x27;t. Similarly, Orwell&#x27;s constructions paint the events after the publishing of the &quot;perfected&quot; Eleventh Edition, some time after 1984, as events that were planned but that never took place.

Compared to a team that took years to write IonMonkey and other parts of the JS engine that are shared.

Experimentation like this (using a superb storage engine to power a popular db) is really exciting.

My evidence is only anecdotal (across ~10 years), but I&#x27;ve never seen any homeless people setting up shop on a bus.<p>There are obviously other factors at play here (transport police, better welfare system, 1.9m vs 3.9m people) that are likely making it different from Seattle, however (and these also reinforce your argument).",1371683335

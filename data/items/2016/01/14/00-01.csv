I probably was - but as I mentioned. It was taught in a rush and I had forgotten it, if it was even taught at all.<p>What is 36% of 25? I&#x27;ll be honest. I find that&#x27;s a pretty tricky one to do in my head. I can estimate it to 8 by taking 33% of 24 (close enough, right?). So I&#x27;d estimate it to be a bit over 8. Honest guess.<p>Well the trick I learned on HN is to reverse it. Since % is really multiplication, the commutative property applies. Take 25% of 36 instead and bam! The answer is a flat 9. No estimating needed.<p>Now the &quot;I&#x27;m an idiot&quot; part comes from the fact I always did percentage as multiplication of a decimal. I should have intuitively put 2 and 2 together and figured out the commutative property applies. I hadn&#x27;t. :)<p>Given the popularity and support the tip received - I&#x27;m going to guess I&#x27;m a good example of the average person. The average person was taught percentages in a way that they can convert to decimals but don&#x27;t <i>think about the math</i> in decimal form. So they miss out on something that is obvious once someone stops and points it out.<p>So to cut my rambling short: simple math is rarely simple for the average person. The average person, from my experience, is worse at math than they would probably like to admit. (And I&#x27;m also an average person.)",1452733157

The deal came with a guarantee: job within 3 months paying £20K+ (at the time a very reasonable entry salary) or your money back.<p>I thought it was a great system - the company got a pool of candidates that they got to know well over a few months and supervised their training and we got a lot of help getting that entry job (more difficult at the entry level in my experience than later as you move higher up).<p>In the end I got a job before the end of the course and through a different agency but it was still a useful experience.",1452733114

Obviously not by all, but a few here and there. Agile / Scrum etc fare much better with devs, not tradional PMO etc.<p>Both these things count against you, and the worst thing you can do then is to enforce the things you&#x27;ve learnt from your management training - as there will always be a certain amount of pushback, especially if you try and make them aware of the business case behind it - some devs like to know the bigger picture, others don&#x27;t care; they don&#x27;t want that pressure.<p>It comes down to paying attention to each person, not the collective, and figuring out their needs. Software or core skills make up very little of how they would see you; some of the most talented Scrum masters I&#x27;ve met have never touched a line of code, and I respect them more so for it.<p>As a manager / leader, some of the best ones I worked with and now try to emulate are the ones that trusted me to get the job done, and made it possible for me to do so. They sheltered the team from the flack coming from higher up, fought for various privileges, always took the fall for any shortcomings and essentially made an excellent environment for us to work and communicate, not to mention they never let you feel the pressure and allowed you to continuously fail and learn from it.<p>Instead of thinking of your role as trying to educate and lead, try thinking more in terms of &quot;what can I do to help my team succeed?&quot; and then ask them that exact question - every day, every week. You&#x27;re not their teacher, nor are you their guardian. You are there primarily to make sure that your team can go about its business unhindered from all the bureaucracy and whatnot that gets thrown at them.<p>Once a team knows you&#x27;ll go out on a limb for them, they&#x27;ll trust you and then reciprocate with their work and actions.",1452732698

It might have absolutely nothing to do with what you are expecting them to achieve.<p>This is slightly embarrassing to talk about, but when I was younger I was not actually hugely popular with the opposite sex.  I always prided myself on being a &quot;nice guy&quot; and I was incredulous as girls went out with &quot;jerks&quot;, ignoring me.  I convinced myself it was because I wasn&#x27;t good looking enough, so I got into body building and got into great shape.  Strangely this did not help.<p>I won&#x27;t bore you with the details of my self-discovery, but eventually I <i>did</i> figure out the reason for my lack of popularity:  I was self absorbed, arrogant, oblivious to the needs of others, etc, etc, etc.  From the perspective of others, <i>I</i> was the jerk.  My evaluation of the &quot;jerks&quot; was based on <i>my</i> set of values, which other people did not share.  I eventually discovered that I needed to understand what <i>other people</i> valued and give it to them (if I wanted to be a &quot;nice guy&quot;).<p>It&#x27;s hard to know exactly what problems you are running into without meeting you.  It is very common, however, to have the same kind of problem that I had -- you are judging everything through your own criteria and ignoring the criteria of others.  Rather than trying to further your own goals, forcing others to fit your mould, you may have to spend considerable effort trying to understand what your team mates value and try to help them achieve it.<p>The tricky bit is that sometimes what your team mates want appears to be at odds with what the company needs.  Often you will have to make the hard choice -- do I help someone get what they want individually, or do I help the team achieve the goals as stated by the company?  To make it even worse, very often your idea of how to achieve the company&#x27;s goals may be incorrect.  My experience is that at 7 years of experience you are <i>just</i> starting to discover ways that will work, but there is still quite a lot to learn.  You are likely to make many mistakes along the way.<p>You can imagine that if you chose to help the company against the desires of your team mates, if you fail (in their eyes) they will be extremely upset with you.<p>One last piece of advice.  There is nothing wrong with choosing the side of team success, even at the cost of pissing off your team mates.  The personal cost can be high, though -- especially if you make mistakes (as you undoubtedly will).  I would favour a mixed approach where you help your team mates meet their own personal goals and only stray from that path when you are absolutely sure that you will be successful.  YMMV.",1452730287

It sounds like your heart is in the right place, and that&#x27;s a good start for being a good manager in my eyes (I&#x27;ve never been a manager personally).<p>One of the best attributes I&#x27;ve found in good managers is <i>facilitating</i> success, rather than participating in it. In one-on-one meetings with your team, listen closely to them. Ask them what they&#x27;d like out of you, what their goals are at the company, and how you can help them achieve those goals. You are no longer writing the code, and while you should have final say on high-level technical debates, let your team work out organically what the best architecture / pattern / technologies are for the project at hand.<p>If learning is something you want to encourage (bravo for that, all teams should be actively learning), use whatever power or influence you have to make resources available to them. Paid time to read books, paid time to attend conferences (and budgets to pay for conference entrance / travel), etc. And instead of you dictating the points of learning, ask them what they think they need to focus on learning for their own improvement.<p>Lastly, do everything you can to limit their distractions. Instruct coworkers in non-technical disciplines to direct all questions to you, be the development team&#x27;s &quot;shield&quot; against pesky interruptions. Managers who have done this for me have won my respect much quicker than those who have not.",1452730244

The net velocity between them is zero.<p>You seem to know at least some physics, how can you possibly not know this?<p>But in your black hole scenario there are not two opposite velocities adding up at the horizon.<p>You can not just directly turn velocity into light, it&#x27;s not possible, you need another object.<p>> Electromagnetic energy (heat and light) is a kind of kinetic energy.<p>Some people define only two kinds of energy: Potential and Kinetic, in that definition electromagnetic energy is a type of kinetic energy, and velocity is a type of kinetic energy.<p>But it does NOT follow that electromagnetic energy is the same as velocity energy!<p>It&#x27;s like an apple is a fruit and an orange is a fruit, but an apple is not an orange.<p>> They actually think their gadget can convert near-light-speed velocities into many other kinds of energy, including electromagnetic, and the creation of particles from energy and the reverse.<p>I take it you&#x27;ve never heard of conservation of momentum? You can not just turn the velocity into other things, you have to react it with something else (which is what I said - go back and read it). In this case they react it with a proton going the other way.<p>They could also react it with the earth, or a slab of metal.<p>None of these apply to a black hole.<p>We have also gotten way off topic from time dilation.",1452730215

I would guess you are doing some things a bit wrong, getting a bit better, having some people problems for the first time, etc. But I bet the biggest problem you have is fear of the unknown, shame of not doing a great job helping others, and burnout at trying really hard at something new and not seeing progress.<p>That emotional filter is going to make it really hard to get your head on straight about both how you&#x27;re really doing and what you can do to improve.<p>The most important thing you can do is try to improve your own self-understanding and get yourself mentally prepared for doing a really hard job. Unless you have a strong ethical/religious/psychological/mindfulness type thing in your life, you also are probably somewhat out of touch with the unintended but real impact that your words and actions have on other people. The worst managers I&#x27;ve ever had were well intentioned and smart but completely lacked self-awareness of their social impact.<p>I would start with trying to take stock and get your own feelings and perceptions under control. Once you can look straight at the situation, without fear or shame, but also with a critical eye, you can orient yourself and get better.<p>So how do you do that? Well, it depends on your background and what kind of thing is going to call you out of yourself and into a different way of thinking.<p>- Belong to a Western religion? Go look for something about contemplative prayer or discernment in your tradition. (Catholic or open to it? &quot;The Discernment of Spirits: An Ignatian Guide for Everyday Living&quot; is great)<p>- Into new age, yoga, or Buddhism? The book &quot;Mindfulness in Plain English&quot; is really helpful.<p>- Like agile, or at least the idea of self-directed teams that are coached rather than managed? Lyssa Adkin&#x27;s &quot;Coaching Agile Teams&quot; has a lot of great content on removing your emotion from a situation, helping people succeed on their own, etc.<p>- Do you find yourself in difficult conversations, where you either are too harsh and people don&#x27;t listen to you or too soft and you can&#x27;t make your point? The books &quot;Difficult conversations&quot; and &quot;Non-violent communication&quot; have awesome advice on thinking about the way you talk with people and reframing issues in a productive way.<p>There are tons of other places to start, but I hope you embrace my core point. Start with yourself, get to where you understand your own bias, emotion, impact. Then worry about helping other people and getting better in your day to day.",1452730206

It might explain a bit.<p>What are your team members actually like? Their personalities, interpersonal conflicts, aspirations, successes, strengths, weaknesses?<p>I don&#x27;t know either you or them, but the fact that you have asked us all for help and told us almost nothing about them suggests (to me - I may well be wrong or biased) that you are not spending enough time getting know them. I expected you to tell us specific situations that would lead them to not like you, but you seem not to know any. I doubt they would be short of reasons if we asked them. It&#x27;s rare to find anyone who dislikes people for no reason.<p>For me, a team lead&#x27;s role is not coding. You are there to assemble, manage and grow the team that will do the coding. Maybe that involves doing some of the code (more likely the code reviews) yourself, but maybe not. Your real role is the people management and that involves a deep understanding of who these people are and what motivates them. If you are trying to stuff engineering knowledge down their throats when what they really want is autonomy (for example), then it&#x27;s unlikely they will warm to you.<p>I would recommend approaching this as a completely new skill, which is as hard to learn as coding was.

I felt like asking this now because this is not the situation in current company but it has been in my past 2 companies as well. So I am wondering if I am really that bad.<p>Chances are, your keen observational skills are better than your winning personality.<p>Its a good bet that you&#x27;re taking a paternalistic approach to managing your team, based on your feeling that you&#x27;re taking care of them and teaching them.  This never goes over well. Like, ever. Recognize that your team probably would rather write some code than be taught by someone they may not respect all that much. They&#x27;re almost certainly capable of determining for themselves what they need to learn in order to do their job. If they can&#x27;t do their job, thats where you get involved.<p>I had a manager once, this guy who was incredibly invested in this picture of himself playing this this role as fearless leader, cool startup guy, and all around genius. He went so far as to write down some speeches he later read to us in what I presume were &quot;leadership moments&quot; in his head. He very nearly killed the company, and every single member of the tech team left before it was done. Don&#x27;t be this guy.<p>There&#x27;s a book by Dale Carnegie called &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot;.  Recommended.",1452729609

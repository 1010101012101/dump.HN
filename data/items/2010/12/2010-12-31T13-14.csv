In the current system if you are more environmental friendly than your competitors you will go out of business (the comments here talk about 10x the costs). I'm not saying this is ALWAYS true, but as a general rule. The system makes environmental consumer-based businesses non-sustainable.

Folks that were dead from respiratory or cardiac arrest, or were dying of anaphylaxis or severe asthma, or recognizing an impending fatal condition and just talking somebody into one of those drives into medical care.  Pushing a med or defibrillating or whatever, and having them survive.  Sometimes just helping somebody get back into their chair, and having a nice chat.  That helps offset the ugly parts.<p>As for heroin, medical-grade opiates tend to be something folks can maintain and can tolerate, it's the random weird stuff and the wildly different purities that can be a problem.  Nalaxone can help there, but if I was pushing that, that patient was in compromise or in respiratory arrest from a likely opiate overdose, and usually headed for dead.<p>And yes, mental issues in real life can extend to and can involve WoW, paramedicine or heroin abuse.

2055368,comment,2052941,2052941,0,0,Lucadg,,,"Even before launching our system in Beta in October, I did some trips in which I tried to sell it.
I really needed to go out there and see what the market really wanted, not what was in my mind.
In order to minimize risks, and because the system itself was not ready (and is not ready) for the big shots, I wrote emails to small business owners.
I first did this in Morocco in May, during a two weeks trip (I mix personal travel and business all the time) and I wrote to Riads (local ""garden"" hotels) which are not apartments (my core business).
I offered them ""a riad dedicated website, easy to maintain and in 8 languages"".
I sold two, having sent maybe 40 emails and met 5 owners.
One bought it because she was tech savy (did her own websites and so on) and immediately understood why it made sense, and the other one simply bought visibility.
She wanted to be ""first in google"" and did not want to hear anything else.
Did not care that she could edit her own prices and pictures, she could pay me for this.
Did not care about  8 languages, she wanted to be first in google, that's it.
I ended up selling her a ""visibility results based"" package and got the deal for a few hundres euros a year. 
First money on the project, I'd take any deal :)<p>Fine for me, but it made me realize that the less they know, the more they pay only for certified results.
Make sense.
As the system grew, so I could target higher, and it became much easier and profitable.<p>So, do I want to target the guys who ""never wanted to be on the internet""? 
No, they will probably be go with a webdesigner who sells a joomla website for 2000-4000 euro (in Morocco they spend a lot, even more than Europe!) and then realize they are not ""first in google"" and spend 1000 more to be ""first in google"" with a local ""SEO"" firm.
I have no time and no need to explain how things work to them, I better invest my time with the guys who, after 5 minutes, tells me ""great idea, let's try it, how much?"".
There's many of them and they will appreciate my project more than anybody else.",1293802887

Their FAQ and rules page didn't say (or I somehow missed it).<p>The way that first comes to mind to do that particular text transform is (using up arrow notation for control characters):<p><pre><code>    :s/./^M&/g
</code></pre>
If shifted and control characters count as one keystroke, not two, then that is 11 characters (^M takes two, because it is entered as ^V ENTER). However, the leader board currently shows 12 as the best solution, and I'm having a hard time believing, since I'm not anywhere near being a vim guru, that my first ""off the top of my head"" solution could take the lead.<p>So I would assume that means modifier keys do count. In that case, mine is 14. Interestingly, no one else has a 14 on the leader board. There are a bunch of 12's, then a 13, then a 16.<p>Assuming the cursor starts on the first character of the first line, my second idea is<p><pre><code>    qea<ENTER><ESC>q24@e

That would be 12. That's about the limit of my vim-fu. Under 5? Way beyond me...unless the submitter accidentally linked to the wrong problem!<p>EDIT: OK, my first attempt above doesn't work. It puts an extra blank line at the top of the file. (Swapping the order of ^M and & puts an extra blank at the bottom). The second solution above works, and I was curious enough to see if I'd guessed the counting rules that I signed up and submitted it, and sure enough it is 12, and it is the same (up to the name of the macro) as all the other 12 keystroke solutions. (Although it turns out I didn't guess the rules. Shifted characters count as one, but it counts whatever you use to save and exit).<p>It's interesting to see the names others use for their macro. A lot of people used 'a' or 'q', and one person used '0'. I'm the only 'e'. I use 'e' for temporary macros because invocation is easier with 'e': @e is easier, it seems to me, to type than @a or @q or @0.<p>EDIT 2: the problem the submission links to is named ""Reverse simple deletion"".

Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other.""<p>Long version:<p>Compared to other kinds of entertainment (books, TV, sports, friends) -- World of Warcraft makes you think about it even when you don't play it. The longer you play the game, the more addicted you are, the more you think about all the things you're gonna do. That's how the game's designed.<p>You think about the game when you're not playing it. It's hard to really focus on something else if you're thinking about the game.<p>Does that sound familiar to you? If you're a hacker, if you are excited about computers, then it must. It's same with hacking and programming. It's the same principle. For example I tried a little Node.js magic the other night and the first thing I did in the morning was getting live comments to work. Then I found out there could be another cool feature, and so on. Excitement. That's what drives hackers. Call it addiction, whatever. Unlike, WoW, you're doing work, you're making money.<p>So please, don't be ever excited about WoW. You don't wanna waste your precious excitement thanks to which you make wonders with programming on WoW.<p>You can do both, but you can't be addicted to both. Which one will you choose?",1293801276

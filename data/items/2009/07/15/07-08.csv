When I was a lay-sysadmin many years ago, I ran BIND because what else was there? but always in the back of my head was the possibility that someone found Yet Another Hole in BIND.  I'm not nearly as concerned about the implementation quality of OpenSSL <i>today</i>; it's been long enough it's probably okay (but at the wrong level of abstraction).  But it historically had enough issues to show up on my warning radar as a lay sysadmin, and that meant that I never really trusted it afterward.<p>Could be complete paranoia at this point.",1247643536

Surely if he would want a consulting job, he would have no problem to get one, with Mongrel as a reference?<p>I remember he used to rant about something like not getting a job, but he can't have been serious? Maybe he is asking 1000$/hour, or his ego really makes him unemployable (which I doubt). But even back in the ""big rant day"" I think there was a footnote somewhere where he said he basically was fine and didn't need a job.<p>Maybe without Mongrel, nobody would listen to his rants to begin with.

If someone were to leak confidential info on the Bush administration's role in Guantanamo Bay, should the press publish that?  How about Microsoft's Halloween memo?  Was that fair game?<p>There's a line somewhere.  Twitter's financial position somehow seems different than Watergate.  I'm kinda curious where you think the line is.

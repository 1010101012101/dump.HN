The download button is right there, but surrounded by things you ought to know first (about the Perl 6 community, documentation, and current efforts.)

You know, stuff that tries to <i>look</i> fancy, or cramp as much irrelevant information as possible into site.<p>Given that what Perl 6 now needs is new guys to work on the project, this site is nicely done.<p>Congratulations, Perl 6, if the language looks anything like the site, it will still look just as awful as Perl 5, but it will be much nicer to read and understand.",1251549270

793101,comment,792062,792459,0,0,alan-crowe,,,"> The question should not be who gives greater returns to society but the allocation based on need.<p>That kind of impractical, feel-good sloganising stifles democracy.<p>How are people supposed to respond? They know that generally people takes a more hard headed approach to issues that directly effect them and the sloganiser is probably being  hypocritical. But complaining about the hypocrisy is to derail the discussion; switching from how resources are alocated within education to quarrelling about how one participant organises his private life ruins the debate.<p>One might try to argue in a loop, saying that allocation based on talent will expand the economy eventally allowing more needs to be met. But the slogan is a feel good slogan. If you are backed into arguing against a feel-good slogan you have to take the role of feel-bad guy in the discussion and that really does feel bad because you are pretty damn sure it is just a slogan: the other guy is probably pretty ruthless in his private life (just look at his debating tactics).<p>But why have this discussion at all? If you have a job and a family you don't actually have time to waste on a ""from each according to his ability, to each according to he need"" neo-Marxist bun fight. You want to have a adult discussion about educational priorities. So when some-one kicks off the bunfight with ""allocation based on need."" you are effectively disenfranchised.",1251548762
793100,comment,791762,791762,0,0,lucifer,,,"My take on this:<p>1 - Patterns address (and are formulated using) the semantics of intent.  They can not address domain semantics; that is addressed in the specific realization of a given pattern (which some would consider ""redundant code"" but that is not strictly speaking, correct).<p>2 - In a meta-reflective language (type i) (such as LISP) patterns are expressed as (reusable) macros.  In languages that lack the ability to extend the compiler (type ii), patterns are expressed as specifications.  So regardless of the expressive power of a type-ii language, there will always remain the possibility that a pattern can be identified that would require an extension to that language's expressive power.",1251548682

793097,comment,792920,793073,0,0,derefr,,,"No, no such thing exists. No one has ever tried to do such a thing before. I'm actually quite confused as to your saying ""before any such claims are made""â€”I have made no claim that such a thing <i>does</i> exist, only that this site <i>could</i> be used to <i>achieve</i> the existence of such a thing. Specifically, I don't support the claims the site makes that it already achieves these things.<p>As far as I know, though, this non-existence is because no one has ever <i>thought of</i> doing such a thing before, not that it's been tried and didn't work out. No one knows if it can or cannot be done, because it has never been attempted. That's sort of why I had to explain the finer points of the idea, rather than just calling it ""an algorithm warehouse"" or whatever it would be dubbed if there had already been a prototypical example to classify.<p>Also, I meant ""big"" as in the phrase ""big in Japan""â€”well-known or, at the very least, actively in development. A big commit log, in other words.<p>To be frank, I haven't actually looked at the site we're both talking about here (and Silverlight isn't quite executable on my machine, anyway.) From first glance, it looked to be <i>trying</i> to be a sort of encyclopedia of good, tested implementations of well-known algorithms for hashing, scheduling, compression, garbage collection, error detection, sorting, pathfinding, and so onâ€”the sorts of things you think about when you think ""algorithm""â€”but failing, because it wasn't reaching the right content-creating audience.<p>These implementations could certainly be written in C, but C isn't a very machine-transformable languageâ€”Scheme or Forth would probably be a better choice. The point, though, wouldn't be to transform the <i>syntax</i> (because that's the easy part) but to transform the <i>paradigm</i>â€”to munge typecasts into real types, or switch loops between iterative and recursive form, or, at its simplest, transform between OOP and functional styles. ""Hand-writing"" the examples would negate the point, which is to let a computer understand how to write in your language, given pseudocode (or a given Well-Known Language.) Basically, it would apply the goals of RDF to code instead of data.<p>If it <i>was</i> this thing, then my argument would hold, and you would also be agreeing with me. I'm beginning to suspect our disagreement lies in the fact that the site itself doesn't live up to the potential that I've layed out here, although doing so would be no more effort. Perhaps I should make my own site?<p>(And just so you know, yes, I'm talking about a completely hypothetical future thingyâ€”this is what I think language design will be like in the future, thus my comment of ""why can't we have <i>rapid language development</i>?"" It would be completely different than what we're doing now, which is reading reference algorithm books (or not-too-well-known-and-quite-recent papers, where this would be much more of a help) and turning the pseudocode into a ""pure idea"" in your head, and then re-encoding the ""pure idea"" as code in your language. Instead, you'd teach the computer to do what you're doing, and then just give it the site's URL as training dataâ€”in other words, making your compiler an AI. I think this site is a good first step toward thatâ€”getting all the world's algorithms in one place, so we can build the training dataset. That's all it is, though, and all I claim it to be.)",1251548299

So I'm not sure exactly which MVC variant is the one that you're reacting against as the dogmatic ""pure"" one.<p>You're more-or-less right about my client-server architecture - I have a split model, and my V and C are somewhat mixed. As the unit of reuse  (outside the model) is the Widget, there's quite a fluid spectrum between ""view-y"" widgets and ""controller-y"" widgets, meaning you can make a decision based on the individual merits of the situation on how far to split the two.

Sounds legit.<p>> have friends who still live there. The overall sentiment<p>I lived in Australia for 29 years and everyone I know thinks Tony Abbot is a fucking idiot, so he must have rigged the election, right? How many of the 2 million Crimean people do you know well enough to have had discussions about their thoughts on Russia? Anything over a million and you&#x27;re probably safe.<p>> The turnout and voting numbers were in fact all legit and no one was going to the voting booths under a gunpoint.<p>a) facts have to be proven. b) who says you need a gun to rig a poll?<p>Apart from being illegal according to their own constitution, the referendum gave no option to maintain the status quo - only to become part of Russia, or to become independent. That sounds amazingly legit.<p>A Russian citizen in Crimea on a one year visa was allowed to vote, which is illegal. There are confirmed reports of people having their identification confiscated before they could vote.<p>Add to this - Russia invited &quot;observers&quot; to validate the legitimacy of the vote. The leader of the group invited to observe is a Neo Nazi and Adolf Hitler admirer. The &quot;observers&quot; from the group were a Frenchman, a Spaniard and a Hungarian. All three are former members of neo-Nazi parties, and currently members of far-right-wing political parties.  Still legit though right?<p>And of course every country on the UN security council except China and Russia must be just saying it&#x27;s illegal and illegitimate for shits and giggles, not because of any evidence.",1397491026

If it&#x27;s a startup, they&#x27;re probably going to have it.

It&#x27;s probably because they didn&#x27;t have this clause or a more aggressive and broad version of it like what we have today. Apple really is a trend setter.<p>Anyways the legal clause is basically ridiculous, since the general legal strategy is to be aggressive early on.

In the end we ended up with a terribly huge mess of script code (I think it was about a third of the actual C/C++ code) and the majority of the per-frame performance-budget was lost somewhere in this scripted mess. The game sometimes suddencly crawled to a halt when some crazy scripting construct was called, and we had a lot of trouble getting stuff into a shippable state until the gold-master milestone (this is the game: <a href=""http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/project-nomads"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/project-nomads</a>).<p>The main problem with scripting layers is that you are basically handing programming tasks over to team members who&#x27;s job is not to solve programming tasks, and thus getting a lot of beginner&#x27;s code quality and performance problems which are almost impossible to debug and profile (unless you have a few top-notch coders in the game- and level-design teams).<p>And then there will be definitely those &quot;creative workarounds&quot; to get something done which neither the engine nor the scripting layer was designed for, which make entertaining horror stories the programmers tell the new hires when they inevitable ask why your engine doesn&#x27;t have scripting ;)<p>A better approach is to give the level designers simple, pre-programmed, combinable high-level building blocks (AI behaviours, actions, triggers, etc), and let them customize a level (as in game area) with this. But never build the entire game logic with such an approach! With this, stuff can still be fucked up, but at least the performance-sensitive stuff can be implemented by the programming team, and it&#x27;s much easier to debug and maintain.<p>[edit: typos]",1397489936

The current de-facto standard mode of operation for disk encryption utilities is XTS, which effectively encrypts each block on the disk with a different key, where the blocks are of the same size as the cipher block.<p>Whether this is of any significance depends on your adversary model. If the adversary controls your storage medium (imaging putting an encrypted container on Dropbox or Google Drive), they can mix-and-match (e.g. copy-paste) different versions of blocks from your history. Imagine your disk to be in a version control system; the adversary could pick the value of the block 1 from version 50, the value of the block 2 from the version 42, the value of the block 3 from the version 100 and so on. They could also potentially discover usage patterns (seeing e.g. that the value of block 3 remained constant between versions 20 and 200, while block 5 remained the same). Additionally, they could corrupt any of the blocks, by turning the corresponding plaintext into random bits.<p>Having a smaller block size means that they can perform any of these with finer granularity. Increasing the block size thus increases your security; ideally, your entire disk would be just one block (the only thing the adversary could do in that case is to completely restore an old version of the disk); but this is hugely impractical, since the performance would be abysmal (you&#x27;d have to re-encrypt the whole disk to change just one byte). So you have a spectrum of performance/security tradeoffs. Where on this spectrum the 1024-bit blocks lie, I&#x27;m not sure, but I suspect that they are better than 128-bit ones.<p>Note that we do have schemes which can do sector-level encryption (the EME mode), but they&#x27;re not used since they&#x27;re 2x slower than the schemes with smaller sizes.<p>Edit: in conclusion, for pretty much every scenario, other security concerns are much more significant than the block size :)",1397489816

For most non-hardcore gaming uses, Intel integrated graphics is fast enough, and it seems well supported on most of the traditional Linux desktops (meaning it uses hardware for compositing, windowing effects and similar).<p>It&#x27;s true that Nvidia and AMD has better raw performance numbers, but for some reason - despite all the years gone by since both Nvidia and AMD pledged support - both Nvidia and AMD drivers still suck IMHO. Nvidia seems more stable than AMD, but overall less stable than the standard Intel drivers. It seems there&#x27;s always something that does not work properly with either of the drivers, being trouble waking up from suspend/hybernate, glitches/hangs (which destroys any notion of &quot;fluidness&quot;) and occasional total driver breakage with new laptops, new linux releases or similar.<p>The only annoying thing is that even though the intel driver works nicely, there are still many things it does not support. If you&#x27;re using Chrome, type in &quot;chrome://gpu&quot; in your browser and count the number of colored lines in the first section. On my f<i></i><i></i>* up Nvidia Optimus system (yeah, current office standard, oh the number of hours I&#x27;ve wasted on that computer) I get 5 greens, 3 greenorangy and 3 reds.\nFor comparison, my Macbook Air Pro running OSX I get 11 green and 1 greenorangy. I do not have my pure Intel laptop handy, but if I remember correctly it has very few if any greens at all. That means Chrome is doing all the heavy lifting without much hardware support. That often means it&#x27;s the same for most apps, possibly except the desktop environments themselves who seems to do a decent job on linux desktops already.<p>Anyway, here&#x27;s hoping that there will be decent Intel drivers for Linux laptops sometimes in the near future, so Chrome and other apps can get more greens and comparable general graphics performance as Nvidia and AMD on OSX and Windows.",1397489694

It&#x27;s been this way for over a decade now. INAL but I&#x27;ve heard that the only &quot;easy&quot; way around it is to make a specific change to your employment contract that makes it less ridiculously broad and aggressive BEFORE you have any issues. You probably need a lawyer for that, and even if you do; your lawyer&#x27;s work only helps if your employer, more specifically their legal team, actually agrees to it. My former coworker&#x27;s wife is a employment contract lawyer so that helped him become aware of it and mitigate it. I don&#x27;t feel that most people have this advantage.",1397489278

Not that that&#x27;s not the play of some REIT&#x27;s (or what they say they are doing but not really doing) of course but I wonder how many of the locations fall into that category vs. just &quot;after a certain point the money essentially prints itself&quot;. Which sounds pretty good. [1]<p>(What you are saying is typically done though with parking lots in cities for sure for various reasons.)<p>&quot;and you still have control of a massive chunk of land to boot&quot;<p>Unless you have land in a particularly valuable location the fact that there is a building on it is going to contradict having someone purchase it for development purposes. It&#x27;s being used. In other words &quot;nothing to see here move along&quot;.  And if it was in a super valuable upcoming area that would already be priced into the land cost and might be prohibitive.<p>I&#x27;d also would like to know what the time frame is for something like this to actually happen and <i>how many times it has actually been done</i>. That is, out of the entire self storage industry, how many locations (multi level for example - those larger buildings) have been raised for a higher use (with every tenant thrown out)? And something else built on the land which generates more revenue. Where a comparable piece of empty land was not available?<p>Of course it might be something that the REIT says marketing wise in order to enhance the appearance of the value of their properties. But to me it seems that the reality of whether that would actually happen (and how often) might be entirely different.<p>That said any links to this would be nice if you can pass along.<p>[1] For self storage that I am also familiar with they predictably raise the price every year. And it&#x27;s not easy to move things out (you need a truck or you need to dispose of something.)",1397488219

This transcoding generally should only change representation and not change the meaning of the converted information.<p>This automatically implies that you can not &quot;inject code&quot;. There isn&#x27;t really anything magic about &quot;code&quot;. That&#x27;s what I think is a large part of the confusion around &quot;sanitizing input&quot;. The input can not represent code, the conversion does not change the meaning, so if the input can not represent code, the transcoding obviously can not cause code to appear either, and thus you are safe - and not only are you safe, but your system also works as it should otherwise, which it potentially does not if you start &quot;removing dangerous characters&quot;.<p>That is why you should not &quot;sanitize&quot;, but only validate and encode/transcode/convert.

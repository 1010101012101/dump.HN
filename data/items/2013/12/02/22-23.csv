But in fact, an IQ score that high could not possibly be a validated IQ score from a currently normed test. There must have been some mistake in administering or scoring the test, back in the day, and the same is true of any other report you have ever seen of an IQ score above 200. (<i>No</i> IQ score above 200 is a validated, currently normed score comparable to other IQ scores. Not one, not any. Scores above 200 are bogus, at least insofar as they purport to be comparable to the scores from IQ tests that most people hear about.)<p>Let&#x27;s see which Wikipedia articles have been revised to fight the myths about high IQ scores, and which merely perpetuate them. Let&#x27;s see, &quot;High IQ society&quot;[1] correctly reports that &quot;The highest reported standard score for most IQ tests is IQ 160, approximately the 99.997th percentile (leaving aside the issue of the considerable error in measurement at that level of IQ on any IQ test).[2] IQ scores above this level are dubious as there are insufficient normative cases upon which to base a statistically justified rank-ordering.[3][4] High IQ scores are less reliable than IQ scores nearer to the population median.[5]&quot; all of which is true. I can remember when that article was much more misleading about how IQ scores work.<p>The Wikipedia article &quot;Marilyn vos Savant&quot;[2] correctly reports &quot;Alan S. Kaufman, a psychology professor and author of IQ tests, writes in IQ Testing 101 that &quot;Miss Savant was given an old version of the Stanford-Binet (Terman & Merrill 1937), which did, indeed, use the antiquated formula of MA/CA × 100. But in the test manual&#x27;s norms, the Binet does not permit IQs to rise above 170 at any age, child or adult. And the authors of the old Binet stated: &#x27;Beyond fifteen the mental ages are entirely artificial and are to be thought of as simply numerical scores.&#x27; (Terman & Merrill 1937). ...the psychologist who came up with an IQ of 228 committed an extrapolation of a misconception, thereby violating almost every rule imaginable concerning the meaning of IQs.&quot;[12]<p>&quot;The second test reported by Guinness was Hoeflin&#x27;s Mega Test, taken in the mid-1980s. The Mega Test yields IQ standard scores obtained by multiplying the subject&#x27;s normalized z-score, or the rarity of the raw test score, by a constant standard deviation, and adding the product to 100, with Savant&#x27;s raw score reported by Hoeflin to be 46 out of a possible 48, with a 5.4 z-score, and a standard deviation of 16, arriving at a 186 IQ. The Mega Test has been criticized by professional psychologists as improperly designed and scored, &quot;nothing short of number pulverization.&quot;[13]&quot;<p>But, yeah, if we get beyond the premise that the man in Korea ever had such a high IQ score (he may have been told the number, but the person who told him made some kind of mistake), then we can reflect on the issue of what we expect from children after they are told they have high IQ scores. Is it a failure simply to make an honest living and take care of a family? I think not. Very high IQ or moderately high IQ, the path to genius also involves a lot of hard work, opportunity, and not a little luck.[3] I think the man profiled in the article has done just fine and has nothing to be ashamed of.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_IQ_society#Entry_requirements\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_IQ_society#Entry_requirem...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_vos_Savant#Rise_to_fame_and_IQ_score\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_vos_Savant#Rise_to_fam...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genius#IQ_and_genius\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genius#IQ_and_genius</a>",1386024105

They had planned that consumers would not be able to resell their discs once purchased with the promise that your friends would be able to play the games in your games library without owning the game themselves (ie. they download the game from your games library) so long as you weren&#x27;t playing the game at the same time as them. People didn&#x27;t like this because 1.) They couldn&#x27;t resell their games and 2.) It required that you connect your Xbox to the internet once every 24 hours. For some reason a lot of people felt like this would affect them (I don&#x27;t know why.. I can&#x27;t remember the last time my internet was disconnected for 24 hours.) As a result of all the negative feedback, Microsoft scrapped their whole DRM system in favour of a more classic approach while Sony basked in the positive attention despite bringing nothing new to the table.",1386023417

These are, you might note, <i>almost exact opposites</i>. People with weak immune systems won&#x27;t generally suffer allergic reactions, because an allergic reaction requires the immune system to overreact, and &quot;weak&quot; generally precludes an overreaction. At worst, they wouldn&#x27;t suffer anything worse than a normal person.<p>Now, this does raise an interesting question, namely: are newborns ever allergic to this stuff? Could it cause a problem? The answer to the second would seem to be &quot;no&quot; given your CDC quote that there&#x27;s no evidence for adverse reactions, and that would render the first moot. However, it&#x27;s still an interesting question, but you&#x27;ll notice that it&#x27;s a <i>completely different question from what you asked</i>.<p>Is your question legitimate? Of course. My point is that mine was legitimate too, but when I posed it, I got a stupid &quot;GIYF&quot; response from you. Apparently you think you have the right to ask questions without research, but I don&#x27;t. That double standard annoys me.<p>Worse, you don&#x27;t even know what you don&#x27;t know. You get the relationship between allergies and weakened immune systems completely wrong, yet you state that wrongness as <i>fact</i>, so obvious that you call it &quot;by definition&quot;.<p>And then, when I call you out on this bad behavior, I imagine you&#x27;ll call me a &quot;fascist&quot; and say that I&#x27;m &quot;suppressing dissenting views&quot; or some such crap.

I say &quot;usually&quot; because there are cases where people are shamed for rumors or outright lies. I think we can both agree that, in this case, the person provided it themselves.<p>The audience, in acts usually considered to be &quot;public shaming&quot;, is provided by a second party. That is, the shameful act would have been private, but then another party brought it to light by providing an audience.<p>In this case, the audience was already there by virtue of the environment in which the person carried out their shameful act. The tweeters <i>enlarged</i> this audience, but they did not <i>provide</i> it as might have been the case if they had been tweeting a private conversation. Even without them, these people would have still shown their shame to a couple hundred other people.<p>Note that I am not saying they &quot;deserved&quot; this treatment or anything like that, I&#x27;m just saying that they made it happen themselves.

Their ‘app store’ was literally boxes of software in a store which you had to install from your computer. No different than 1980s PCs.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not really true. Mobile devices around that time were designed as peripherals of the PC, so you could download apps to PC and install them by cable-syncing. Palm apps were just .PRC files.<p>It really wasn&#x27;t too complicated and was a far sight from buying shrink-wrapped software in a physical store. It&#x27;s just a shame that Palm, MS, and other platforms left this stuff to third-party websites instead of making it a more seamless experience for users and a more profitable one for them.",1386021826

It&#x27;s the only non-american major player, and it&#x27;s well known for its security and reliability.<p>Anyway, if you&#x27;re trying to decide between the Q10 and the HTC One, I think the biggest difference is the keyboard. If you prefer a physical one, just go BB. If you prefer a larger screen to watch pictures, videos and play games, buy the HTC One.<p>FIY some days ago Nokia gave me a free lumia for development purpose, and while typing on its screen keyboard I really missed the physical one of my Q10. With my BB I can type precisely without watching the keyboard, and I love it, while on touchscreen I feel insecure.\nSometimes I&#x27;d like to have a bigger screen, but I wouldn&#x27;t trade the keyboard for that (If you want to watch a movie, tablet are a better choice anyway).<p>Speaking about apps, as I already said I don&#x27;t really feel such a huge gap. I have all the apps I usually use, and for the missing ones there is always the android runtime (which runs pretty well and is constantly improving). In addition to that, I feel a greater UI consistency in BB10 native application, compared to iOS and Android ones. You have settings on the top, main bar on the bottom, togglable action bar on the right and menu bar on the left. Imho this is a great value for BB, which is instead missing on Android.<p>Then, we could speak about swipe based ui, blackberry hub and a lot of things, but I think you already know all I could tell to you.<p>So, regardless of your final decision, I hope you will be satisfied with your new smartphone. Good luck!<p>(and sorry for my poor english)",1386021795

I think shell is easier to parse than it seems, there are definitely some nuances that might be tricky to emulate, but I guess it&#x27;s a matter of effort and how far you&#x27;re willing to go. For syntax highlighting in IDEs, you probably don&#x27;t need much, and maybe even a few regexs can get you close enough.<p>I actually spent a considerable amount of time going over bash&#x27;s parser [0], and also zsh&#x27;s [1]. Bash uses lex/yacc with some custom code. zsh seems to have a custom written lexer/parser.<p>Unfortunately none of them were written to be used as a library, as evident by global state, and a lot of hooks for prompts while parsing, etc. It might be possible to somehow make it work, but it seems like a lot of work to me. You might have an easier time looking at the parser I wrote, and extending that, or rewriting it in another language (as it&#x27;s fairly small compared to the ones you find in shells).

One way to make it safe would be to disable interrupts, although non-maskable interrupts would still be a problem.<p>However, although I haven&#x27;t checked the details, I suspect that something much cleverer does make the trick robust. What would the hardware interrupt service routine overwrite the out of scope memory with ? For many CPUs, maybe for the 6502, it would be the return address from the interrupt service routine - which is slightly different to the originally pushed return address, but still on the same page, which is all that&#x27;s required.

[1] They spun off an autonomous division to create the PC, and put as much distance between it and the existing org as they could -- both physically (down in Florida, with IBM HQ in New York) and organizationally.<p>Not to malign your overall point though. I agree, not only does the IBM of today fail to engage in offensive product disruption like the PC, they don&#x27;t even seem interested in defending against disruption anymore. Their strategy with the Thinkpad line, and now their x86 servers, seems to be to sell before the disruption fully kicks in and there&#x27;s nothing left.<p>Defending against disruption is really expensive, maybe that&#x27;s the lesson here.<p>[1] <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=SIexi_qgq2gC&lpg=PA43&ots=AiALfHJ5Dq&dq=innovator&#x27;s%20dilemma%20ibm%20pc&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q=innovator&#x27;s%20dilemma%20ibm%20pc&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=SIexi_qgq2gC&lpg=PA43&ots=A...</a>",1390499862

7109789,comment,7108641,7108641,38,0,JunkDNA,,,"This is wonderful. I think some of the commenters here are missing the point by insisting that how they learned to code is how everyone should learn. If we&#x27;re going to get to a point where coding is a basic type of literacy like math or reading (and I&#x27;m not necessarily saying I agree with that goal), then you have to start small when kids are young. Really young kids need some kind of framework. You can&#x27;t just throw existing programming books at them and say, &quot;have at it&quot;. Do we throw high school level geometry books at kids to teach them shapes? No, we give them all sorts of fun story books that incorporate shapes (and colors, and numbers...) so that they get the basics. I suspect this book is trying to fill in that early gap with respect to programming.<p>My youngest child could count to 10 at 18 months most likely because she insists on me reading the infernal book &quot;Deborah the Dozy Duckling&quot; all the time. It&#x27;s about a duck that falls asleep while playing hide and seek. The whole book is frankly awful and I hate reading it, but that one page where Deborah&#x27;s friends count to 10 turned out to grab her for some reason.

Gems fetched through bundler are hermetically sealed libraries that live in their own little secret area of the filesystem; when you add a gem dependency to your project, you&#x27;re extending the platform that you&#x27;re building code on.<p>Golang&#x27;s &quot;package&quot; system works more like C&#x27;s than like Ruby&#x27;s: when you build a program out of libraries, you have the source to those libraries in a well-known highly-visible place in your build environment.<p>Think of Golang&#x27;s package management as a refinement of the &quot;codebase/<package>/third-party&quot; idiom in C, and not as an npm/bundler competitor. Golang third-party packages don&#x27;t work like gems. They are raw code that you build as part of your application.<p>You could build an npm-alike for Golang; I&#x27;m not sure how widely used it would be. I like having my third party deps laid out in my repo and easy to read/patch.<p>You can argue that the C third-party idiom is worse than Rubygems, and reasonable people can disagree, but I&#x27;ve had a lot of experience in C (I started my career as a C dev) and a lot of experience with Ruby, and gems have caused me more problems than third-party deps ever have.",1390499762

By your definition, computers should be terrible at Air Traffic Control, Driving Cars, Logistics Planning, and even playing Chess. But computers are incredibly advanced at those tasks...performing well above their average human counterparts, and in some cases even better than the best human specialists.<p>Humans have developed a large skillset through evolution, and it is a skillset that includes highly sophisticated heuristics for problem solving, communication, and physical interaction.  Even 15 years ago, the top Ops Research and Artifical Intelligence researchers and their computer models couldn&#x27;t outperform an ordinary truck driver on the Traveling Salesman problem on average. Now, there isn&#x27;t a human in the world that can outperform their models. 15 years ago, there wasn&#x27;t a single robot in the world that could compete with an ordinary human in the task of <i>walking</i>. Now we have Boston Dynamics.<p>The idea that humans are special at making decisions with incomplete data is short sighted. It assumes that computers can&#x27;t improve at the task.

Wiretaps should also only begin once a warrant has been approved by a judge, any wiretap in bulk so you can retroactively get phone records and conversations from the date before the warrant was issued is unconstitutional. If the person in question kept their own records, the warrant can apply to those records, but to keep a tab on every American, innocent or otherwise, is disturbing.<p>Personally, I would love to see a two-factor commit with all warrants. All warrants should require two judges to sign off on them, one federal judge and one state judge where the wiretap will be carried out.<p>The other thing I would like to see is some sort of &quot;cost&quot; that the agencies must bear to be able to request warrants. It should cost each agency money to apply for warrants and they should have a limited budget each year to spend on warrant applications. At the end of each year, to apply for increases in this budget, they should present an equal number of both cases which they would have liked to pursue warrants on someone, but it was deemed outside the budget and cases where they pursued a warrant and got one, but the person turned out to be innocent. Such a policy applies market forces to limit rampant wiretapping and phishing expeditions. Instead they will adjust to only use their warrants on those people who actually should be wiretapped. This would also help prevent unilateral action by a single agent or team, without appealing to another independent group with power of the purse over warrant applications. Individual agents and teams would try to get warrants for all their suspects, but the group with power of the purse has the responsibility to dole out warrant applications according to merit so that the agency doesn&#x27;t run out of them before year&#x27;s end.",1390499013

The startup scenes are more progressive in London, Berlin or Amsterdam, although not quite as much as in the SF Bay, of course. If I lost my right to be in the US, I would be amazingly disappointed, but I would simply go to one of these cities, and stop worrying about my country being far behind. I only realized this once my plan to get here was on track, so I stayed in Paris far too long, I&#x27;m afraid, but you don&#x27;t have to make that mistake.\n - You have a decision to make about effort. Legally moving to SF with a job and legally moving to London with a job are both possible things, they just take a different amount of effort. For London, you&#x27;ll have to make a little money first to make sure you can go from time to time to look for your next life, and to make the big move when the time comes. For the US, you&#x27;ll have to make far more money first, come here 3 revenue-less months to look for a job, limit yourself to large companies (those that mind visas issues less), be overly patient with people who don&#x27;t mind abusing your weakness, ... It took me 5 years to make it with this project, and I&#x27;m still one of the lucky ones; but I was willing to take a chance, and to keep fighting through the effort.\n - There&#x27;s another road that is made possible by the European crisis; it&#x27;s riskier, but faster: create your own startup. Work a Java dev job at the same time, but find an awesome startup idea, and work on it on your free time. Find time (and money) to come meet investors in SF (save money and time, and make sure you&#x27;ll have interviews before coming). Investors in the US know that there are no serious investors in France or Italy these days, so they love to meet European entrepreneurs with nice startups, who are willing to move to SF. Once you&#x27;re well-funded, getting a visa gets much easier.<p>Get in touch with me if you need help with anything else.",1390498816

Over the past 6 months every few weeks they glitch. What happens is that at exactly midnight eastern time all three phones start showing the lock screen for two seconds, followed by a second of a black screen, followed by five seconds of the Apple logo on a white background. During this time the phone is running. When on the lock screen  you can actually swipe left and start entering your unlock code, but you will get interrupted. This usually goes on for at least 6 hours. Hard resetting the phone does not fix it: you just boot to the same state. Restoring from a backup does fix it. And seems to be the recommended solution on the Apple forums.<p>This is a huge problem. First, it slights up the whole room and drains the battery. If not on the charger, the phone will die and our alarms will not go off. If on the charger, the phone will also keep buzzing. BTW, we use standard Apple cables and chargers. Restoring from backup takes a long time and I do not wish to do that for three phones in the middle of the night.<p>I really hope this new update also fixes this problem. Has anyone else encountered this, and if so, have you had luck talking to Apple about it?<p>Edit: none of the phones are jailbroken or have ever been. The home network is not special in any way other than having IPv6.

Your immune system upregulates appropriate antibodies on its own through a feedback effect when certain cells (B cell?) that have randomly generated embedded antibodies on their cell membranes come across an antigen.<p>These cells begin to divide faster, and the children code for and generate the same antibody as the parent. This ups the amount of cells with that particular antibody, increasing  the probability that the antigen will be targeted.  They trigger inflammation to increase the flow of blood, letting more immune cells per second pass through scan the area (probably not helpful for aids, but for a cut, a splinter or a tumor that is fixed in place it is useful).  They also release freestanding antibodies with the same binding profile that can disable viruses and trigger other immune cells to come slurp them up.<p>I think when they say they aren&#x27;t taking  an antibody approach they mean they aren&#x27;t making an artificial antibody and just injecting it for passive immunity (sort of like injecting an immune system that can&#x27;t do its own adaptation and upregulation)<p>The main thing with vaccines I am still confused about is what the difference between them and allergy shots is, and how do the two end up with opposite effects?

Whereas, before that threshold, new demand could only be satisfied by human labor, owing to society&#x27;s inability to immediately automate the requisite processes.<p>If this hypothesis is true, then once we cross the threshold, we should see a long-term decline in employment. That&#x27;s not to say no new jobs will <i>ever</i> be created after reaching the threshold. No doubt they will. Even so, more jobs would be lost than created,  resulting in a <i>net</i> decline.<p>If we take this idea to its logical extreme, we can envision a world in which <i>every</i> process and occupation can be trivially automated. If we assume such automation always costs less than subsistence wages[2], then presumably any given firm will choose to automate all of its processes rather than employ people. The result being 0% employment.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_unemployment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_unemployment</a><p>[2] This is a big assumption. There could be a dynamic equilibrium where market forces balance the cost of automation against the cost of living. Thus the TCO of a robot would in many cases be very close to the cost of a human employee. Processes would then be divided amongst humans and robots in accordance with the relative costs of automating each process.",1390498536

This has been going on for millennia, ever since the first genius learned to herd goats rather than hunt them. People just have a very narrow definition of &quot;automate&quot;. We don&#x27;t plow our fields or harvest our crops by hand anymore, leading to massive reductions in farm employment over the past 100 years. But we don&#x27;t think of tractors as &quot;robots&quot;, so it gets ignored.<p>I have this saying that drives my whole career&#x27;s thinking... &quot;Have computers do what computers do well, have humans do what humans do well.&quot; Computers are wonderful about performing precision tasks perfectly, at incredible speeds. But they are terrible at making decisions in the face of incomplete data. They can be programmed to sort of simulate it, but it&#x27;s not the same. Meanwhile, humans are incredible at making correct decisions using incomplete or incorrect data, but it&#x27;s almost impossible to get them to do the same thing the same way twice in a row.<p>So the jobs that will last are the ones that require decision-making in the face of incomplete/incorrect data.

Americans envy Europeans for their 5 weeks of vacation and high-quality healthcare. (All taken, the EU package is better.) I don&#x27;t think Europeans have US envy in general, but NYC and the Valley (which are world capitals that happen to be in the US) still have a draw. Even still... I think you&#x27;re exaggerating the appeal.<p>Sturgeon&#x27;s Law: 90 Percent of Everything Is Crap. It&#x27;s true in Italy, I&#x27;d imagine. It&#x27;s also true in the Valley. For everyone founding an exciting startup, there are hundreds of cubicle drones at places like Oracle. Coming to the US and working in the Valley won&#x27;t automatically make life amazing.<p>Anyway, the Valley is a <i>really</i> shitty place (suburban purgatory) to be unless (a) you attend Stanford or (b) you&#x27;re a venture-funded founder or VC. Without (a) or (b) you&#x27;re likely to find the same anonymous corporate grind you can find in small-town Pennsylvania (where I originally come from) or a conservative, risk-averse European city.<p>If you find a specific job in the US then, by all means, come over. But my advice in general would be to find something of quality in the EU; it&#x27;s probably easier for you, right now, to do that than to find quality in the US. You&#x27;re not &quot;trapped&quot; just because TechCrunch and Valleywag aren&#x27;t interested in covering the companies in countries accessible to you (the whole EU, I believe). Anyway, most of those VC darling companies are awful places to work. You probably over-value the Valley startup scene because you read too much HN. Most of the startups in the U.S. (yes, even in the Valley) are also hellish, overly bureaucratic for their size, and dominated by conservative MBA culture.<p>If you end up in a job that&#x27;s &quot;bureaucratic&quot; after college, fine. Learn what you can. Use it as an opportunity to learn about people and how they work together. Figure out <i>why</i> it sucks. Keep the technical skills sharp and continue getting better at solving problems. Expect it to take years before any of this pays off.

It seems some people believe they (at least ought to) exist in some Utopian society where everyone should know what may upset everyone else (even in the slightest way) and endeavour to avoid at all costs. I mean it&#x27;s maybe a nice concept on the whole, but the over intricate levels these people take it to are ridiculous.<p>That is not what triggering means. Generally triggering means you are going to talk about things that, for people who may have suffered horribly at the hands of, may cause you to flashback to those times. For example, if you are writing an article about rape, it may be that someone who is a survivor of rape would not want to read such a story as it may trigger flashbacks, panic attacks, etc. due to their history. Generally speaking, you usually want to notify someone up front if a post or writing contains something really disturbing for some readers. Moreover, being slightly upset is not being triggered, being triggered is more like a full on episode and is emotionally traumatic. If you&#x27;ve had the luck to never have something like that happen to you, you should be extremely thankful.<p>>  Simplifying a name, or even a gender is not a personal attack or an attempt at discrimination, it&#x27;s just in truth a simple system.<p>Actually, systems that override a person&#x27;s ability to control their name and/or gender are discriminatory inherently. How many times have we heard stories about people from different cultures with longer names that have them badly handled by services and cause them problems? Systems and designs that normalize western style names are inherently discriminating against everyone else. Systems and designs that proscribe for only 2 genders or that genders are static are inherently discriminating.<p>> I&#x27;m sure there are people in the same situation that haven&#x27;t had this problem, so how it isn&#x27;t user error is beyond me. It&#x27;s a free service...<p>Free service or not, how user data is handled is an important aspect of design. When the systems being produced by Google leak details intended for use in only one service or product start to cross pollinate in a way that is difficult for the average user to understand, it is not user error it is designer error.",1390497302

Why would I care when I don&#x27;t even feel that it&#x27;s valid?<p>In fact, attempting to answer quickly is what lead me to feel it was largely a trick, because it switched up locations of gender after consistent streaks of a given gender (or other metric) being presented solely in one place. Several times I&#x27;d be <i>just</i> about to click something and then think &quot;Hey, what the heck? Why did it suddenly move the answer?&quot;. This represents a confounding variable in the experiment, because it no longer strictly measures beliefs, but instead measures a mixture of beliefs and motor ability (ability to react quickly to the changing locations of answers), so the test can&#x27;t determine if an answer was due to belief or motor ability.",1390496563

11878,comment,11823,11823,0,0,jonesmc,,,"I'm in as well but you know there is a meetup group in Atlanta called Atlanta Web Entrepreneurs?
<a href=""http://web.meetup.com/32/"">http://web.meetup.com/32/</a>
hopefully that link works, if not just search it on meetup.com.  I think the meetings do have some fee though, like $10 or something (maybe that was a special meeting, not sure).<p>It would be nice to just have a very casual time and place to hang out and discuss wisdom of crowds, python vs. ruby, turbogears vs. rails, Mochikit, etc... and see what each other is working on, no fee, no requirements, just meet at Carribou at Perimeter Mall (Abernathy) on Thursday evenings?  you will be recognized by your Mac book and a Rage Against the Machine t-shirt :)",1176303170

11875,comment,11491,11491,0,0,cwilbur,,,"Depends on the site.  A site offering customized Christmas cards won't do well immediately if you launch in January; a site offering something useful for preparing for college won't do well immediately if you launch in November.<p>Launch the site as soon as it's ready to be launched.  You'll drive yourself crazy trying to micro-optimize and asking yourself if you'll get more traffic if you launch on Tuesday or Saturday.",1176302797

11873,comment,11502,11755,0,0,cwilbur,,,"Well, slow growth while I work at my day job.<p>$10-$15K is the difference between being able to quit my day job and get the company going in 3 months and having to keep my day job and get the company going in 9 months to a year.<p>And if I need to keep the day job, slow sustainable growth -- meaning I can project income, and project reasonably accurately when I can quit my day job -- is much better than a spike that I need to deal with in crisis mode.",1176302651

I had two strikes against me in that I'm a single founder and I'm more interested in building a company I want to work for than in becoming rich at it -- so my interests and investors' interests don't line up.<p>Of course I'm still proceeding -- Y Combinator money was a means to an end, and not an end in itself.

11871,comment,11777,11777,0,0,bootload,,,"pencil, paper or software, words or images?<p>Pen, pencil and paper are fluid, cheap and unconstrained. What do I mean by unconstrained? Well it has to do with brain structure. Drawing visually uses very primitive parts of the brain that efficiently processes information with little interpretation overhead. So your ability to transfer ideas using pencil to paper work with diagrams (images) better than words. [0]  Your ability to create your ideas is superior [1] with pen and paper than some software tool.<p>My personal preferences are to use pen/paper, then white-board and marker, camera and lego. [2] Then text (electronic) and only then to some form of constrained tools like a diagramming tool, methodology.<p>Reference<p>[0] Curt McNamara, 'Applied Systems Thinking '<p><a href=""http://www.tc.umn.edu/~ahler002/TFTCON.HTM"">http://www.tc.umn.edu/~ahler002/TFTCON.HTM</a><p>[1] WIth limitations most of them relate to the proximity of your team.<p>[2] Notice they are all tactile stuff.

Just make something that you feel has value and hopefully other people will too. I think Paul is a very intelligent guy and I love reading his views on stuff but if you stop working on a startup just because you didn't get his blessing into yComb then you're giving him WAY too much credit.",1176301643

A mission, a quest that will give you 5g, 6000xp, and faction with YCombinator, but remember its an elite quest, bring others.<p>Do not fail, well fail, but do not fail at failing!

If you're a Zerg in SC2 you must program yourself every thirty seconds to go around to every hatch and inject larvae, every time, even in the middle of microing a battle.  This is hard to do for most humans and even for professional gamers, and is one of the (many) things that drives me absolutely bats about SC2.<p>The thing that infuriates me about that particular example is it would take thirty seconds for someone at Blizzard to make that ability autocastable.  But the analogous macro capabilities (Terran mules, Protoss chronoboost) are not so easily automated, and so everybody has to have this stupid timer in their heads.  I like the Company of Heroes/Dawn of War 2 model better, where you can set something on ""overwatch"" which means the moment you have the resources, it will start building it.  Not everything in DOW2 is overwatchable but a significant amount of the niggling details like troop reinforcement is, and it can really simplify things like ""I want a Chimera ASAP"".

Think about what you have and what you can be thankful for.<p>2) Speak using only positive words for an hour, avoiding negative words.<p>3) Keep a list of things you are proud that you have accomplished, and as you read it, smile a bit. You get natural feedback.<p>4) Do a small thing to fix your circumstances, such as cleaning a window, that you can then sit back and enjoy.

I understand very well how it works, I don't even know what your point is anymore.  It works for moving tiny amounts of money, I am not disagreeing with this statement, it's just silly in my mind and it's not solving anything new nor is it scalable in its current form, in fact it has some very obvious weaknesses which make it a terrible idea for any real amount of money.  Then again, I think bitcoins are a joke to begin with, it's programmers reinventing currency and realizing that hundreds of years of finance actually did solve some of the big problems.",1319602146

Eventually, you would realize you become smarter and have much more knowledge as you age. Also, other things will eventually kick in. So now is probably a good time to learn as much as you can, by giving yourself as much break as you require.<p>Once you hit 2-3 burnout phases, you will realize what you've known all along.<p>Definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. Turns out a lot of time when your work is your life, you are not allowing yourself time to look your work at a higher, simpler level of abstraction, and you end repeating a lot of mistakes  at different levels.<p>Once you start taking some time off from work, you come back so refreshed and with a much better perspective too.<p>In long run, I think this is why slowly after your twenties, your work is not your life anymore, since you would have learned so much by then, and be smarter about everything in life.<p>Plus family and friends do take some more time than now.<p>It's all about finding the best balance that works for you, where balance does not necessarily mean equal distribution of time.<p>I really think this is why there is no one single formula for success and happiness, you have to find what combination of external environmental factors and internal thought process works best for you, and also it changes a lot with time.",1319602122

(as well as your other one, which I've responded to in the wrong order, ha)<p>I think my other reply regarding outsourcing vs doing it myself frames what you have said here perfectly.<p>Ultimately, I do not at all think I can learn to code in a few months or a year or even 2 (well, be as proficient as I want to be and should be anyway). I know for that a fact, just based upon myself researching and learning about all the different languages, frameworks, terminology, and so on. Even that tiny amount shows the immensity of what there is out there. To be proficient, it takes YEARS. I don't underestimate it all.<p>As a result, I do ultimately believe I have 2 choices: outsource or do it myself. I'm honestly leaning towards outsourcing at this point since if I need a technology guy regardless than why not get an MVP put together sooner (and better) by outsourcing?<p>I guess it plays off what you've quoted: ""invest in what you know"" and I don't know coding, so perhaps I should hire what I can afford and ultimately look for someone to join forces with myself once I've created an MVP and traction and have something to really show for myself.<p>I might not have the technical know-how to bring to the table, but I believe I have other valuable qualities and a great idea and vision.<p>Thanks for wishing me luck and I appreciate the advice.<p>Thank you for all the posts from everyone thus far!

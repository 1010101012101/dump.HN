That&#x27;s (unfortunately) human nature.  One could argue that Ashley Madison (to use a current example) with their slogan &quot;Life is short, have an affair&quot; is living this just as much as Martin Luther King.  Once you remove morality, then you have nothing to give any positive direction to your values, because you have no basis for defining what &quot;positive&quot; means, other than your own feelings and thoughts.<p>> He felt rationality leads to values which benefit humanity as a whole.<p>Other philosophers would disagree.  de Sade, for example.  (Yes, he was a philosopher, and his writings and actions were an expression of his philosophy.)  And even human history seems to show that Nietzsche was overly optimistic on human nature on this point.<p>In &quot;The Abolition of Man&quot;, C. S. Lewis argues that rationality, by itself, can never give real values.  That can only come from &quot;practical reason&quot;, not mere reason, because it has to tie reason to values and emotions.

The deal company charges for the bundle with the hope that companies will offer them competitive deals for free (and potentially cut them in on a % of total deal sales if they co-promote it).<p>TBH, I haven&#x27;t seen much success from testing these sorts of things myself (not yours necessarily, just generally speaking).  The issue is always that they don&#x27;t get enough volume to be really worth it for brands of a certain scale.<p>There&#x27;s also the concern that people are buying discounts, not product, so I imagine there are a bunch of people that buy this for discounts off of a couple products, and ignore the rest.  Depending on what a given brand would need to contribute to get listed in this, that directly determines whether it is worth it or not to get you all the assets, help with co-promotion, etc.",1440200471

I&#x27;ve lived in Southern California for quite some time, experienced the traffic all across the southern half of the state.  My unique experience is having lived as both low income and middle class, and experienced a lot of Southern California both in a car and in public transport.<p>What I think most people miss when it comes to transport in general is that it has a disproportionate negative impact on low income individuals and families.  For example, another commenter on here says this: &quot;People in a hurry win because their time is valuable and they get to buy it back relatively cheaply.&quot;  I assume here that they are referring to those with high income.  Well, to be frank, time is more valuable for _low_ income individuals than it is for those who are well off.  To think otherwise is to spew rhetoric that I&#x27;ve heard regurgitated for the longest time.  I even believed it myself, until the span of my life experiences proved it to be false.<p>See, when you&#x27;re well off, you have freedom.  The freedom to choose what job you want to work, where you want to live, how far you want to commute, and how you want to commute.  And most importantly, money buys you time.  You spend less time doing mundane chores, often opting to use your financial resources to have those taken care of.  Time is really not as valuable to you, because relative to those without financial resources, you truly have more time to enjoy life.  You have the freedom to vacation, take evenings off, spend time with family and friends.  I get that a lot of middle-class people don&#x27;t opt to do this, and instead bury their heads in work.  But the point I&#x27;m making is that they can choose to do that, or choose to spend more time doing other things.<p>But those who are low income, their time is completely and utterly consumed by working.  They have to work as hard as possible, as long as possible, only to make enough so they don&#x27;t starve, all while racking up debt.  They don&#x27;t have the freedom to choose where they work or when they they work.  They can&#x27;t take vacations.  They can&#x27;t buy time for themselves.  They commute with a beat up junker where they have to run the heater in the middle of summer so the engine doesn&#x27;t overheat.<p>Getting back on topic, this is where I talk about public transport.  It&#x27;s terrible in SoCal, and it makes the lives of those already suffering, worse.  The buses are always late when you&#x27;re early, and always early when you&#x27;re late.  It takes hours to go miles.  And it&#x27;s expensive.  You&#x27;ll have to transfer buses several times, for sure, and each time you get charged.  If you&#x27;re unlucky enough that you have to take the bus several times per day, you get to &quot;benefit&quot; from a day/month pass.<p>And the worst part?  It&#x27;s demoralizing.  Buses are depressing.  Yes, they&#x27;re stereotyped, in that everyone thinks buses are dirty, and the people on them are degenerates.  The truth is, they&#x27;re the salt of the earth; hard working people trying to provide for their families.  I&#x27;ve never seen anyone be violent on a bus here, and generally everyone is pleasant.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t a depressing place to be.  You&#x27;re poor, everyone else is poor, and nobody likes being there.<p>Like I mentioned before, time is more valuable for those who are poor.  An extra hour could mean the difference between going deeper into debt, or maybe, just maybe, finally, slowly, paying off your credit card bill.  That extra hour doesn&#x27;t mean as much to the middle class.  It really doesn&#x27;t, and I wish the rhetoric otherwise would cease.<p>The traffic in Southern California, the terrible public transportation, it all negatively impacts the poor more than the well-off.  Toll roads do nothing to fix this; they tax the lower-middle class.  Congestion pricing taxes the poor.  The only real, sustainable solution is to tax the wealthy to pay for better public transportation.  Call me a robin hood commie for saying that, but it&#x27;s true.  Taxing the poor to pay for crappy public transportation (which is what we do now) only makes things worse, widens the wealth gap, and destabilizes politics.",1440199877

You could have an &quot;execute&quot; instruction which crossed two pages (2 byte alignment, 4 byte instruction). It could target something like a &quot;move character&quot; (MVC) instruction (a memory-to-memory move of up to 256 bytes) that also might be in two pages.

This is more like breaking the in-kernel API for .ko modules—and the official Linux policy on this is [1]. Firefox has always been much <i>less</i> inclined to break its internal XPCOM APIs than the Linux kernel has been to break its internal in-kernel APIs.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/stable_api_nonsense.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/...</a>",1440198217

In fact, you can actually get basic tree-based editing <i>today</i> in Emacs!<p>The easiest language to support like this is Lisp because its syntax is about as close to pure tree as possible. And, indeed, Emacs has had structural editing for lisp for a while in the form of Paredit[1]. More recently, somebody extended this idea to Haskell[2] which is interesting because Haskell has one of the more complex, persnickety syntaxes around.<p>I&#x27;m not saying either of these are as good as dedicated editors—I&#x27;m not even convinced they <i>could</i> be as good—but they are low-cost ways to try these ideas out right now without abandoning general-purpose text editing or creating a brand new tool.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://danmidwood.com/content/2014/11/21/animated-paredit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danmidwood.com/content/2014/11/21/animated-paredit.ht...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/chrisdone/structured-haskell-mode"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chrisdone/structured-haskell-mode</a>",1440198193

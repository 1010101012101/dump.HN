I am taking part in an internal development program and one step is to visit other companies. I would like to learn any new practices we might want to try and pass on any we have found particularly helpful.  These do not have to be just development processes; we also have a great office culture (http://culture.fool.com/) that we are always looking to improve!  I would love to spend a morning, afternoon, or even a full day with you and your team especially if you are really proud of the work you do and the team you do it with.  I hope to keep this pretty low key so I dont impact anyones day too greatly.<p>Our shop is mostly ASP.Net with some old classic ASP thrown in for color.  We have web forms, ASP.Net MVC, and all three view engines in play.  Our builds and releases are highly automated, mostly done on a one week schedule but we do release as needed.  My team has recently started to develop a new site using django, which has been a fun experience learning puppet, buildout, and fabric.  I would love to visit with your team if youre running a larger website on django!<p>I hope this can be a fun time, I cant promise any business changing ideas but I can promise a cool Fool baseball cap and lunch!  I will be in town a couple days before PyCon (March 5th and 6th)!  Please feel free to email me at mgurtzweiler@fool.com to coordinate.<p>Thanks!",1328360291

Sometimes I'll start a new presentation and take some material from a previous one, but I still typically do so as a new document.  Given a model like that (which seems fairly standard in research), unlimited projects wouldn't really affect me much, since I can just delete projects I've finished with.  (I wouldn't keep the canonical original on ShareLaTeX anyway.)<p>Do you expect many people to keep a giant pile of still-edited documents on ShareLaTeX?<p>Regarding git: using it for basic built-in versioning seems useful, but in my case I actually don't want to treat ShareLaTeX as the canonical source of the document and keep the git repository there.  I'd just like to use ShareLaTeX as an editor, and keep the Git repo elsewhere.  I don't know offhand the best way to support that, though.  Pushing to ShareLaTeX to edit and pulling back when done to push to the canonical repo could work, and it seems like the simplest option, since you can safely ignore conflicts entirely.  Using ShareLaTeX as an editor on a third-party git repository seems potentially awesome, but fraught with unfortunate security implications, as well as having to deal with merge conflicts on pull.",1328358381

I was a vegie from birth until about 2 years old, then ate meat until I was about four, then went back to being a vegie when I was force fed Liver and Onion at my parents hotel.<p>I don't think there is any real social pressure on me to eat meat. Once in a while I get a jerk who isn't one of my friends trying to explain to me the ""error of my ways"". But it's pretty easy to shrug that off, with an equally obscene response of something like ""animals are my friends, and you don't eat your friends do you?"". 
Ha.<p>But the real reason is I can get by fine without eating meat and would be viciously sick I'm sure if I ever attempted to eat meat now.",1328357456

I've got no interest in linking my identity in one online service to my identity in a totally unrelated one.<p>I've just signed up for a free trial to Netflix and they seem to be determined to force you to link its account to your Facebook one (you can avoid it by signing out of FB before going on the Netflix site, but even if you do that it then attempts to link the two together in the background next time you go on the Netflix page). But I don't want my FB page filling up with a list of things that I've watched. Partly because I may sometimes want to watch something I don't want to broadcast to the entire world, but mostly because I doubt that most of my friends have the slightest interest in keeping track of my everyday viewing habits.",1328357244

3550860,comment,3549384,3549384,31,0,wccrawford,,,"At my previous job, I signed on with really low pay because I had little professional experience, but tons of personal experience.  They quickly realized they were underpaying me and in a year, I was almost at what I was worth, and at 3 years, I was there.  Since this was my only real experience on my resume, I felt this was a good response from them, and they valued me.<p>Then they refused to  give me good raises the next 2 years.  My skills were increasing faster than ever, and I was the only guy who knew the entire system inside and out.  Everyone in the company came to me when there was a problem because I knew how it all fit together.  (I did not hoard this knowledge...  Others were disinterested in having it, or didn't stay long enough to matter.  I was unable to pass it on, and documented as much as I could at all times.)<p>So at 5 years, at my review, I asked for a raise.  The answer was that if I ""really cared"" I should go talk to my boss's boss.  ...  Seriously?  After some arguing, my boss eventually told me that they would be looking to correct everyone's salaries within a year.<p>Faced with the knowledge that they intended to knowingly screw me for a year, and then possibly continue afterwards, I started replying to the job offers that had been coming in.  I had previously been ignoring them.<p>Right away, I found a company that looked good, and signed on.  For a 40% pay hike.  I had known I was underpaid, but didn't realize it was that much.<p>6 months later, the pay raises came in at the old job.  A friend who was making what I made (!) got a 20% increase.  He managed to find get a job offer at the same rate I was now making, and took it back to them.  They refused to match it.<p>And in case that wasn't insult enough, they put out a job ad for 7 new people at the rate I was now making.  The rate my friend tried to get them to pay.  Their existing, experienced, efficient works were worth less to them than random people off the street.<p>I told my new boss about all this and he gave the same advice that a lot of people here gave:  Do not accept a counter offer.  IF the company gives one, they intend to replace you soon with someone who won't hold them hostage.  Because that's how they see it.  You are demanding that they pay you more, or you'll quit and leave them short of staff until they can find a replacement.  They can't take the chance that you'll do it a second time, so you're out of there as soon as they can make it happen.<p>And he's right.  I'd do the same thing in his position.  All he needs to do to avoid that problem is to pay me properly, and that's happening.  It's so simple.",1328357170

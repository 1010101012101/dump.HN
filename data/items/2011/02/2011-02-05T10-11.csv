On github, it would be nice if you could attach a pull request to an existing issue (last time I tried this it didn't work).<p>Perhaps ""pull request"" is a bit of a misnomer?  Technically speaking it's correct, but if the idea was more that you can interleave patches with a discussion, maybe it wouldn't seem so unpalatable to your way of working.  If the discussion doesn't end up merged into ""master"", just close the issue in question as ""wontfix"" or similar.",1296903500

Both are too expensive for me right now, but you're right, they're not <i>that</i> expensive considering it's a trip rather than an ice cream cone.

I got tired of explaining it over and over, so I wrote this. I got both positive and negative responses to it, and they fit a very definite pattern. The positive responses were always short and in the line of ""this is exactly how I feel about this, glad I'm not alone"". The negative responses were variations of ""you've never tried it, so you can't possibly know what it's like"", with optional ""take your uninformed opinion elsewhere"".<p>Now, Steve, as someone who has actually used the site for a nontrivial amount of time, writes a post bringing up mostly the same points.

I have a form of cystic fibrosis, as does my 23 year old son.  I have gotten off 8 or 9 prescription drugs. I have not been on antibiotics for about 7 years.  I have been drug free for about 18 months.  My son has not been on antibiotics in nearly 13 years.  He has been drug free for about 4 years. Ten years ago, I was bedridden for 3 1/2 months and spent a year at death's door.  Doctor's told me ""People like you don't get well. Symptom management is the name of the game.""  I currently live without a car, thus walk a lot, and have a full-time job.  The hole in my lung has closed and my symptoms have basically all disappeared or greatly improved.<p>Modern medicine has it's good points.  But a lot of other traditions also have value.  I think it is unproductive and a straw-man argument to pit them against each other.  I don't see why we can't take from both and build something better than either.<p>I've been trying to stay out of the comments in this thread about medicine because I'm basically one lone ""nutcase"" who is dismissed by most folks in the CF community.

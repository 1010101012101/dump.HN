I have managed to get a new job teaching cybercultures/new media stuff at a University in the UK, and also work on a media streaming project. It is keeping my boyfriend enthusiastic that adds spice to our relationship... I have also done a lot of new media work with the British Association of Sex and Relationship Therapists.. and they are having lots of difficulties with their clients complaining that SOs are spending too long online or are disinterested. It's also revealing to see that the problem of the disapearing SO has manifest itself as a piece of software too. And yes.. I guess we are mythical beasts but the best way to solve this is being honest with your situation in the first place, and don't take for granted that your SO will understand or appreciate your devotion to your project. The best thing is to try and get them involved in some way.. .or end/put on hold the relationship. This works for me!<p>Happy days!",1188208794

Or just email me so I have your address.<p>I wouldn't worry about having put too much thought into this, I'm sure we've all spent a lot of time thinking about some really far-out things.",1188205984

Um, all I can come up with is, ""I'm working on other projects... that are more complex... and less of a sure thing.""  =P<p>Anyways, if you're inspired, go nuts.  Lemme know if you want any help building it.  Also lemme know if you want to hear the rest of the idea.  (I think Phase 2 could get you one or two patents, and Phase 3 could disintermediate some dirty old men.)<p>Uh, is it weird that I've put so much thought into this?",1188205716

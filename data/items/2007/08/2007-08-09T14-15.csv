I'm not a Newsvine user (I waste more than enough time reading Startup News!), but I think that Newsvine allows you to set up a personal feed, so that people who think you're a good editor can follow your feed. <p>Not sure about how you might go about setting up a small-group feed a la BoingBoing, where you and your twenty cronies collaborate to edit the news.<p><p>",1186671040

And certainly they know that if they maltreat any YC startup, they won't get any more deals in the future.<p>But the thing that really motivates investors (and acquirers) is competition. That's why we try to bring so many investors to demo day.  (Today there are so many coming that we had to get a tent for the founders to stand in while they're not presenting, because there's not really room for everyone in the building.)",1186668938

Caffeine makes me irritable, and since I've made it almost 30 years without trying a cigarette I have no intention of trying one any time soon.<p>Sometimes I record myself at the piano while I'm drinking, and then go back later and extract any of the good ideas.  I've never had any luck coding drunk, though.",1186668033

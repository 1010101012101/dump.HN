If you're doing any sort of tech-heavy conference, you have to assume that the venue's internet traffic will at least double, will be of a different type (more than just light email and web browsing, etc.) and that their infrastructure isn't designed to handle it.<p>When you're dealing with high concentrations of users on WiFi, your first worry isn't IP addresses (and honestly, with 1918 ranges, if you need to worry about IPs, you've got bigger problems), and it isn't available bandwidth.  The very first problem is going to simply be client associations with the APs.  Each AP can only reasonably manage so many connections, and a high concentrations of users makes it that much more difficult to partition the traffic.<p>A good BS filter will be to add a 0 to the number of people you expect to be in attendance, and ask the company ""So what architecture would you use to support this?""  If they mention mesh or T1 (unless they start talking about multiple bonded T1s and rattle off numbers), thank them for their time and leave.  If they mention wireless uplink (or backhaul), ask what sort of throughput can be expected.  If they don't give a hard and fast number (or reasonably small range) thank them for their time and leave (one caveat, if they list rates they've seen in other setups but they vary quite a bit, they're good).<p>The thing is, the problem has been solved, and can be taken care of.  But it takes a couple of network engineers and enough planning to pull in a circuit just for the event.  And that's assuming all the equipment necessary is on-hand.  One month lead time would typically be pushing it if you need to pull in a large circuit or it's an exceptionally large event (1000+ people).  Any less lead time than that and it's not the company to blame, because some parts of the setup have external dependencies that the company cannot speed up.",1260427849

I have a strong Ruby background and the last few months I have been using Scala alongside Ruby.<p>1.  In short, yes.  I think the key for me is using a mix of Scala and Ruby.  For many tasks, I am not as efficient with Scala.  I think that is 2/3 my inability to more effectively leverage the language and 1/3 the language itself.  I find Scala to be incredibly clear; in many cases more so than Ruby.  The type system and pattern matching can do amazing things for readability.<p>2.  The Artima book is helpful to have at hand, for sure.  As for getting up to speed, both the O'Reilly book and the Pragmatic book are good.  Just from my feel, the Pragmatic appeals more to those coming from a Java perspective, and the O'Reilly appeals to people with a Ruby/Python background.<p>3.

Once you get used to pretty much everything returning a value, Python can drive you <i>insane</i>. The only thing I generally miss about Python is that's more usefulf/friendly as a command line scripting language. But for building an app, Clojure all the way.<p>I use JavaScript even more, and Clojure has all the things I like about JavaScript except even more flexible and useful in contexts other than web programming (OpenGL programming for example).

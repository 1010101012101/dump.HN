2705009,comment,2704348,2704723,14,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"At some point in the last 50 years the US has developed a significant subculture of lawyer-worship. It's not unusual to see commercials hourly on TV asking for people who might have suffered in one way or another to contact a law firm for a lawsuit. Lawyers find ""little people"" who have been wronged, sue in court, pocket millions, then go on to the next case. Effective lawyers make a killing at this business, and don't be mistaken: it is a business.<p>The little folks, seeing other people make all the bucks, aren't stupid. They look for ways in which they might have been wronged and contact lawyers. For many, ""winning the lottery"" and ""having a big lawsuit"" are the same thing -- a way to easy money. The lawyers are all too willing to play along, setting up mills where good cases are sorted from bad ones. They take part of the profits to advertise for more. It becomes a feedback loop, which is sad, because there are a lot of people who have been really wronged and need legal help.<p>What we need is tort reform, but every time somebody brings it up they're called either an apologist for big evil corporations or a heartless bastard who could care less for the downtrodden. So the cycle continues.",1309261736

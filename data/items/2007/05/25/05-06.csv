Another large factor I really like is the peace of mind knowing that it actually works in production environments and isn't impossible to scale.  Also, their documentation rocks.<p>The only other one I've really checked out is web.py.  It has a much more raw feel to it.  I'd probably switch to it if for some reason Django started getting in my way a lot.",1180072198

I don&#x27;t know of your specific circumstances, but you might consider dropping the school completely, and instead exploring anything that you&#x27;re interested in, if it is viable in your case. Life is too short to spend it on what others think you need; yes, it might take longer to get to a certain level of knowledge, but on the other hand you won&#x27;t waste time trying to satisfy others, so the two will pretty much cancel out in most cases.<p>I followed the same route, with great results -- but I never had courage to do it until I was in my forties, spending much too much time on trying to fit into other people&#x27;s ideas what I can and should do.",1423911591

And if we&#x27;re not careful with horizontal distribution, the cooling of the troposphere below and the warming of the stratosphere by the absorbtion will be different in different places, and there will be changes in pole-equator (or smaller) temperature gradients, and this in turn will change circulation patterns, and boom, some other kind of climate change! (This happens for volcanism for example, because most volcanoes are at the equator.) I somehow doubt we can really control the distribution well, and long-term it might distribute itself differently due to changed circulation. Hm, I haven&#x27;t seen model runs for this kind of thing, might be interesting. (I have papers for the base facts somewhere though. Most knowledge is from the well-studied Pinatubo eruption.)<p>Plus, what happens if we stop, for any reason? This could only be a temporary solution.",1423911505

New features are added only if they meet these goals. Therefore you have guarantee it will always scale and it has no single point of failure, not even a temporary one, regardless of which feature you use.<p>Some other new database engines do it in different order - first adding as many RDBMS features as possible and then making some of them kinda scalable (in some circumstances, if the phase of the moon is right, etc.). Sure, that might feel less cumbersome at the beginning on a single laptop (feels like good old RDBMS), but once you scale it out, it is far from being all roses.<p>BTW, duplicating (denormalizing) data is the way to go if you really need scalability. In general case, joins or traditional indexes with references from the index leaves to the original data do not scale on distributed data sets.",1423909287

But what would be the point of expressing skepticism here?<p>I&#x27;m not investing my money on it, and I&#x27;d be annoyed if significant amounts of public money were being dolled out for it, but if Google and others want to spend a few billions investing on AI instead of funding a few yachts for their shareholders, I&#x27;m all for it. And like you pointed out, if anything self-driving cars will be held to an higher standard in terms of security, so I don&#x27;t see a problem there either.<p>There was an article recently saying how people bought lottery tickets to justify dreaming big about their possibilities. If Google wants to pay for our ticket, I&#x27;m not complaining.<p>(By the way, I say this as a layman.

To make a noticeable difference in terms of global climate change, americans would have to do much more than &quot;pay a little extra&quot;.  The entire commercial shipping network relies on carbon fuels. That&#x27;s land, sea and air. The power grid and utility structure in most communities is destructive to the environment in some way. Changing all of that would require an investment in R&D and social re-organization equivalent to entirety of <i>ten</i> WWIIs. It&#x27;s understandable that the majority of citizens wouldn&#x27;t want to pay that cost. There&#x27;s sacrifice, and then there&#x27;s masochism. Not to mention that China and India aren&#x27;t going to give up their chance at a western energy guzzling quality of life just because we do.<p>The idealism of children is great and all, but there&#x27;s a reason that we don&#x27;t let 10 year olds make major policy  decisions. The naivete of youth is a very powerful thing that is responsible for some of our greatest innovations and new ideas. But it just doesn&#x27;t play well with political decisions.

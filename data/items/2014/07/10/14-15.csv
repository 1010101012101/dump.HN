8015176,comment,8010233,8012906,1,0,bravo22,,,"You are correct. Think of iBeacons as kinda of like GPS. They feed you data, not the other way around. You can certainly have more advanced capabilities w/ BLE -- similar to what you suggested -- but you&#x27;d have the single master problem.<p>To comment on your understanding:\nThe app doesn&#x27;t need them hardcoded, it can query a server and say: here are the beacons I see, where am I?<p>Alternatively you can include location information in the data broadcast by the beacon. So one of them can say I&#x27;m at the end of isle 1, the other says I&#x27;m at the start of isle 1, and yet another says I&#x27;m at the end of isle 2. You can figure out your approximate position by their relative signal strengths. They can even have broadcast the exact GPS coordinates of where they are located (hardcoded in them of course) which if I recall correctly Apple can use to update their location service to give you very accurate positioning.<p>Bear in mind though that beacon data, unless encrypted, is public but even if encrypted it can be duplicated so someone can mess with you by creating a duplicate tag and placing it nearby.",1405004302

Simple fact is I cannot pursue this program since I am 4000 EUR short (Annual Tuition fees) and I do not have resources to tap into. Please read on:<p>I am a 22-year old girl from India. I got admission into Erasmus Mundus European masters programme &quot;EM Fusion&quot; with partial funding.<p>An international research center called ITER is being set up in France and India is a partner in this effort. The EM Fusion course is to train scientist- engineers for this advanced research facility.  <p>A part of this programme I have to study one year at University of Lorraine, France and the second year depending upon specialization at Madrid, Sttugart or Gent.  <p>The European consortium is offering a partial support of 650 EUR monthly for living expenses. One may need additional funds for this, say about 150 EUR, which I can afford. <p>However one needs to pay 4000 EUR per year, towards the tuition fees. If I raise the amount to get in, then I can somehow figure out Year 2.<p>Any leads is appreciated. My email ID is PuneKale  at google’s email service.<p>Thanks",1405004072

8015027,comment,8012255,8014699,2,0,davedx,,,"> Realistically speaking. Lasers would lead to mirrored ships. Particle beams would likely lead to the magnetic shields proposed for protection against the solar wind. Explosives will be highly inefficient in a vacuum, so they&#x27;d only be implemented like in current bunker busters. So we&#x27;re talking kinetic impact weapons.<p>I&#x27;ve given this a lot of thought recently, working on my own hard sci-fi space game :)<p>I don&#x27;t think mirrors are a good protection against high powered lasers. I&#x27;ve done some reading around the Internet and the consensus was that even if the mirror is absolutely flawless and perfectly clean, it&#x27;s only a matter of time before a laser punches through it. The best defense against laser weapons turns out to be bad weather, which is hard to find in outer space. (Fighting inside a nebula might help?)<p>I think beam weapons will be devastatingly effective, once ships have enough power behind them, leading to battles at extreme ranges (light seconds to light minutes), where evasive manuevers can be somewhat effective.<p>That&#x27;s my take on it, from reading various Q&A&#x27;s on the net and thinking a lot about how space battles would probably really work in the near future. It&#x27;s great fun to think about.",1405001728

ANYTHING to DO. Even bringing a book or iPod on a train. Some people feel extremely uncomfortable just sitting doing nothing. Being &quot;bored&quot; so to speak.<p>However boredom is GOOD for you, for adults and especially for children. It fosters creative thought as well as has other positive aspects. Introspective thought and sometimes problem solving comes from boredom. Think about it - where do your best ideas come to you? In the shower.<p>That&#x27;s why I get so depressed with how I see kids behaving these days. They have a zillion toys, DVDs, computers, iPods, tablets because (GOD FORBID) they don&#x27;t have anything to do for a second.<p>They bring their toys outside of the house. I never once in my life brought a toy with me outside of the house. If I had to wait someone I just (gasp!) waited. They are watching movies in the car (!!!) and this is considered a positive to keep them occupied (and presumably just quiet). I was  at a (somewhat snoody) restaurant and I saw two kids who were like 8-10 years old who brought several coloring books and crayons with them and they were all splayed out on the table like it was a child&#x27;s play place. The concept seemed to be HORRIBLE for them to not have something to do in the time frame between ordering and eating! A full 10-15 minutes!<p>Well in my opinion it is setting the children up for failure. They aren&#x27;t interacting with their environment, engaging in conversation, asking questions, or even just learning at some point you have to learn to sit down with nothing to do. Or even learning to find something to do when they are &quot;bored.&quot; Kids used to be good at that. Games like &quot;I spy,&quot; hand clapping games, pretend and make believe, doing each other&#x27;s hair, inventing games, singing, trying to find license plates from every state, creating dance routines, cops and robbers (and the politically incorrect version - cowboys and Indians), etc, etc. My friends and I even wrote, memorized, and performed an entire play when were were children.<p>I remember going to a really boring after school program for poor kids. There was basically nothing to do for hours other than a small playground that I was way way too old for. So I created a whole world in my head. I was out in the woods. I had to collect firewood and build a fire. I collected sticks, dug a small hole, arranged the sticks as I would if building a fire and arranged rocks around it. Bundled more sticks to make a torch, etc.<p>I have preteen cousins. When they visit family they don&#x27;t interact with the family at all. They are on their phones the ENTIRE time at Christmas. I don&#x27;t even know them at all except for what their parents tell me.

Even then I&#x27;m not sure that naming conventions that leak less information than a basic port scan will slow APT down.  Too, the administrative overhead caused by forcing sysadmins to constantly go to a CMDB just to do basic troubleshooting might be a cost targetted organizations would be willing to pay.

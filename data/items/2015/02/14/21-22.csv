Using an augmented assignment operator makes no sense if the left hand side can not be assigned to. I don&#x27;t know Python well enough to tell why it does not check if the left hand side can be assigned to before evaluating the right hand side, i.e. why it dos not check that __setitem__ is present. This would make the behavior more similar to a compiled statically typed language where this would be a compile time error and the right hand side would never get evaluated.",1423951154

9050903,comment,9049467,9049467,0,0,ignoramous,,,"Unless start-ups or top companies [0] start adopting OCaml, I doubt its rise would be meteoric. Take go-lang, for example. It performs no better than Java on JVM, but is gaining tremendous traction because Google is putting all its weight behind it. I believe C# gets far less credit than it deserves... and MSFT knows exactly what its doing by open sourcing it. I digress. I feel, one is better off investing time in Clojure or Haskell (if functional programming is what one is after), both of which are gaining a lot more traction in the industry and the academia compared to OCaml.<p>I can speak from what I observed here at Amazon... which did try and make use of Erlang (due to its excellent concurrency model) at one point, but gave up (Simple DB is powered by Erlang, but its successor DynamoDB is JVM based). At least Erlang had its chance... OCaml community within Amazon is non-existent. Whereas Clojure (plenty of traction within due to STM on JVM, I guess) has plenty going for it, as does Nodejs and go-lang. All of these plaforms are popular due to the strong community presence both within the company and at other tech power houses.<p>I&#x27;d also like to point out that the current crop of volunteers behind ocaml.org [1] are doing a really great job of evangelising OCaml.<p>[0] <a href=""https://ocaml.org/learn/companies.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ocaml.org/learn/companies.html</a> and <a href=""http://clojure.org/Companies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojure.org/Companies</a> and <a href=""https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_in_industry"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_in_industry</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://ocaml.org/about.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ocaml.org/about.html</a>",1423950534

While the other part of the functional camp are convinced that modern type systems (usually the ML variety) are more than sufficient for expressive programming.<p>Within the ML static typing camp you have people who adamantly claim that in order for static type systems to be sufficiently expressive, you must have a particular kind of polymorphism, or that this kind of polymorphism must be implicit - not explicit. Or they might form a stance along the lines of strictness vs non-strictness.<p>Then within the strictness camp, for example, some people will form a stance that your language must be formally specified (SML) as opposed to having only a reference implementation (OCaml).<p>At the end of the day, we&#x27;re left with a handful of people who share our exact opinion about what languages would <i>in theory</i> make the industry more productive.<p>Meanwhile, the enormous sea of industrial engineers are still using Java/C++.<p>It can end up looking like people debating which particular brand of natural spring water should be given to millions of people who are thirsty in the desert.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m saying anything helpful, and I totally understand <i>having</i> a stance on any one of these issues.

9050891,comment,9050343,9050343,0,0,zach,,,"Essentially, this is the way that Google sets the standard for acceptable web content.<p>It&#x27;s subjective, it&#x27;s vague, and sometimes unfair but that&#x27;s the burden they have to bear. Defining the &quot;quality&quot; of a web page for a search has become as important a factor to web search as any other.<p>But &quot;search quality&quot; is a leaky abstraction like any other. When someone looks up a random phone number that just called them, they aren&#x27;t looking for a blog post about it. They&#x27;re looking for a very small amount of information.<p>Let&#x27;s imagine we&#x27;re determining the quality of a web page as a search result. Say we&#x27;re looking for the combatants of the Second Boer War, so our query is &quot;second boer war combatants&quot;. Now, if we had a page that listed only and exactly the names of those combatants, that would seem to be the &quot;answer&quot; we&#x27;re looking for. But wait, isn&#x27;t it better to see a page about the Second Boer War which has a lot of other information about the conflict? Or a page about the military history of the most notable combatant? Or even a table of major historical conflicts with their combatants?<p>Basically, although it would seem like a precise &quot;answer page&quot; is the best, there are a lot of other factors. The most popular kind of search results are often Wikipedia pages, so people seem to want that level of information on a subject. People sometimes search for something as a way to get to something else. The nature of the web indicates that pages with links to further information are more useful than those without them. And of course, as untrustworthy sites proliferate, the more well-compiled, organized and correlated information is on a page, the more reliable it is.<p>So ultimately, I feel like it&#x27;s inevitable. As search has improved, Google has to make these kind of choices, in a quantifiable way, about the nature of a quality search result. And that ends up, in the tools-make-us stage of the web we&#x27;re in, shaping the envelope of what web content is popular, even in some way acceptable. In turn, the web becomes easier for Google users to use by becoming easier for Google to index and search effectively.<p>But this is the more painful reality, as I also know. You get pushed out of the Google results not by sites with better information, not by sites that are more relevant, but by sites which seem like they can play the &quot;Google game&quot; better because they have the resources and profit motive to put together good metrics for the myriad signals that make you rise in the ranks.",1423950204
9050890,comment,9049186,9049186,0,0,derriz,,,"Reasonable time cost estimation is certainly possible with software.  It&#x27;s not particularly easy but you certainly have a better chance if you at least expose yourself to the decades of hard research on the subject and not arrogantly imagine that everyone before you started programming of flogging your &quot;agile approach&quot; was an idiot and knew nothing about software development.<p>Software estimating is not a particularly pleasant task - neither for developers (they generally have no training in the area and so don&#x27;t even know how to approach the problem) nor managers (who have too little technical knowledge).<p>And since 95% of development is writing in-house CRUD stuff or putting together lightly trafficked web-pages, it&#x27;s tempting to bask in ignorance and pretend that not only is the task almost impossible anyway (and so pointless) but that in-fact it&#x27;s unnecessary. And for IS department mickey-mouse projects, this is probably the case.<p>Some of us however have had to pitch fixed price tenders for large software development projects, for example.  And no, the customer isn&#x27;t going to accept that it will be done when it&#x27;s done and that we should just start a few sprints and see how it goes.  And if you get the estimate wrong (too low), you screw yourself and lose money on the project - too high and you don&#x27;t even get the contract.  In this environment, you learn quickly that estimation is vital, difficult but possible with the appropriate effort.  And yes I hated doing it the first time but it became almost satisfying after a few iterations having gained some confidence.<p>This assumption that a &quot;post-industrial&quot;, agile, folksy-anecdotal approach is appropriate for all software development really pisses me off. It breeds developer myopia, ignorance, self-importance and exceptionalism.  Believe it or not, engineers have estimated, planned and executed very complex systems inside and outside of software.  But it&#x27;s only in software engineering do you find clowns earnestly claiming that estimating or planning developing some crappy CMS system is beyond human capabilities because software is so &quot;different&quot; and that estimating and planning a project like the Hoover dam was easy in comparison.",1423950201

Could this then mean quantum decoherence isn&#x27;t so much the result of measurement as it is the result of time running backwards at the quantum scale? This would mean time runs forwards at the gravitational scale but backwards at the quantum, and the collapse of quantum states is where the two time directions smash into each other, so to speak.<p>Perhaps the existence of consciousness is also the result of time running backwards, somehow reaching up from the quantum to the macroscopic level. It would be just as good as the weak anthropic principle to explain why we humans seem to be the only intelligent life in the Universe. If the rise of consciousness was somehow planned and executed from the future, it would perhaps even <i>require</i> only one instance of consciousness evolving somewhere given how difficult it might be for those in the future to execute it.<p>One hint this is actually what&#x27;s happening is the fact the distribution of the planets in the solar system appear to be fine-tuned for inter-stellar space travel. There&#x27;s only about 10 other solar objects with gravity comparable to Earth&#x27;s and hence suitable for long-term civilization. The Moon has already been walked on, and humans will one day easily build large contained cities there using telepresent robots with a 1 second response time. Then they will be experienced enough to tackle Mars and Mercury with semi-intelligent robots to cater for the much longer response time. Mercury will be a good candidate to build a huge particle accelerator around its equator because its very slow rotation allows human workers aid in construction, and its highly elliptical orbit around the Sun would give many gravitational variances for experiments. Jupiter&#x27;s 4 large moons would provide humankind with experience of much longer travel times, a single large moon of Saturn eliminates any initial choice of target, then the huge gap skipping Uranus&#x27;s lack of sizable moons to Neptune&#x27;s Tritan gives an even longer travel distance. Concurrent with all this, humans will spend probably thousands of years to terraform Venus, the ultimate in hostile environments. By then humankind will have trained up, apparently serendipitously, for inter-stellar travel using knowledge from terraforming Venus, travelling huge distances to Tritan, and whatever&#x27;s learnt from the Mercury particle accelerator.<p>Perhaps humans will build a silicon-based consciousness in each star system they colonize. Each planet-based consciousness in the galaxy could then communicate with one another to build a one-off galactic consciousness by structuring the gravitons flowing between the star systems, though its speed of thought would be far slower than that of humans. Ditto for each galaxy humans eventually reach in the observable Universe, and then the whole Universe. This Universal Consciousness based on gravity then &quot;begins&quot; to reach back in time using quantum retrodiction to ensure fine-tunings so one planet in one galaxy 14 billion yrs after the Big Bang evolves monkeys then humans who then mutate as they colonize the galaxy and build silicon-based AI and eventually a single Universe-wide gravity-based consciousness. If the Universe continues expanding and never comes to an end, then such a Universal gravity-based consciousness need never finish being built, it only needs to be continually being built. If a graviton-based consciousness can indeed reach back in time through retrodiction, not only would the Universe increase in entropy over time, but also increase in intelligence.

9050873,comment,9049186,9049186,0,0,andyhoff,,,"#NoEstimates to me is often an indicator of poor company culture. It immediately makes me think of shops where there&#x27;s a disconnect between developers and the rest of the organization.<p>The business and product people are unable to explain why they need estimates. Often they don&#x27;t know it themselves and are just passing on the request from their bosses or customers. They hold devs accountable for estimates even if the requirements, priorities and teams change. They also think estimating is free - they don&#x27;t realise that producing meaningful estimates takes time and requires a deep understanding of the code base. It also requires clear, precise requirements which they are unable to provide.<p>Developers at these shops believe their single responsibility is producing elegant code. They don&#x27;t have to prioritise features based on their cost and value; and they don&#x27;t have to communicate with clients, investors or sponsors. Many devs never learned estimating, that&#x27;s why they call it an &quot;art&quot;. They spend forever to produce estimates that turn out to be way off, even if requirements and circumstances don&#x27;t change. The lazy way out is to say: Estimating is a waste of time because estimates are almost always wrong.<p>I have seen estimating done right: It took about 5%-10% of the overall effort spent. It helped make or break business cases, prioritise features and manage client expecations. It raised questions that, if left unanswered, could have resulted in massive cost explosions and unhappy customers later on.<p>Key cultural ingredients:\n- Business and product people don&#x27;t live on an island. They understand that estimating is neither free nor instant. They work close enough with developers to know what level of detail is necessary and they also understand the value of refactoring, test automation, pair programming, etc.\n- Developers don&#x27;t live on an island. They are involved in product decisions and client communication, so they understand why people are asking for estimates. They not only take pride in the quality of their code but also in their ability to deliver features quickly\n- Estimates are not used to crucify developers, but the company culture allows an open and forward-looking conversation when the actual effort deviates a lot\n- Estimating is seen as a skill. Becoming good at it (ie. accurate and efficient) is a requirement to get senior dev roles\n- Everybody understands that when the world around them changes, the estimates change too<p>Final note: work should be estimated in line with the predictability of the business. If your company is pivoting every 8 weeks then there&#x27;s no use in estimating 6 months out. If you have a successful app for iOS and consider expanding to other platforms, it&#x27;s probably worth estimating",1423949593

I had a quick read.\n\n    For the sake of other readers, if you don’t have time to read Part 6, here is the summary of the summary:\n\n    If you are using a decent OS like linux, as opposed to direct hardware access (who other than google ever did that?), all you need to worry about is how to co-locate your data. By “using”, I don’t mean using O_DIRECT, which basically says, “OS, please get out of my way.”\n\n    If you do use O_DIRECT, do “man 2 open” and search the man page for “monkey”. If that’s not enough, google “Linus O_DIRECT” and look at the war with Oracle and the like. You could probably also google “Linus Braindead” and you are likely to find a post about O_DIRECT.\n\n    If you are one of the few people actually working on the kernel’s disk layer, you probably know all this and is unlikely you will ever be reading this.\n\n    As for co-locating data, there is no way to do it without knowing your app inside out. So know your app. For some apps, it can make orders of magnitude difference. That’s your domain. Leave the disk to the kernel. Let it use it’s cache and it’s scheduler. They will be better than yours and will benefit the whole system, in case other apps need to get at the data too. You can try to help the kernel by doing vectorized read/writes although that’s a bigger deal with spinning disks.\n\n    Ata Roboubi</code></pre>",1423948720

Of course, using the Boehm GC negates the advantages of the thread-local heaps, but I don&#x27;t think that Nim&#x27;s implementation of them scales up to large-scale software in any case for the reasons I detailed in my other comments. IMHO, if you have a garbage-collected, multithreaded language that must compile to C (and doesn&#x27;t need interoperability with a reference-counted object system like e.g. Swift does), the Boehm GC is the best choice.",1423948383

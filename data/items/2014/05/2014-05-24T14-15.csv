The advantage for languages supposedly comes from the fact that we are hard-wired to acquire language at a specific age range (&quot;Critical period hypothesis&quot;). The biggest advantage is for infants, which steadily tapers off until puberty. I doubt we&#x27;re hard-wired to acquire CS the same way - programming or theory.",1400943589

7793430,comment,7790065,7790525,1,0,zedadex,,,"The article is correct in saying that nobody has &quot;the answers.&quot; Religion is not _the_ answer, it is _an_ answer.<p>You may feel as though the previous sentence is belittling your beliefs. However, saying the answer that works for you would work for everyone else is just as belittling to other&#x27;s beliefs. It&#x27;s an intractable stalemate that has only one logical conclusion - that no one can (or should!) assert their beliefs as being the only way to go. I wholly acknowledge that your beliefs are what work for you - but I do not recognize them as &quot;the answers&quot; the OP is talking about.<p>For something to be &quot;the answer,&quot; singular, would require it to be the _psychological_ answer to stressors. The reason the article is so psychology-oriented is because &quot;the&quot; answer would by necessity have to be a psychological one, not a personal one. Something that works for one person (like establishing a relationship) but may not work for the next can never be &quot;the answer&quot; that a better psychological understanding of the problem would reach.<p>In spite of how much religion has done for you, it isn&#x27;t an answer that works for everyone, and so is obviously not &quot;the answers&quot; OP is referring to. It&#x27;s still <i>your</i> answer, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s <i>the</i> answer. Psychology is the only commonality between all human beings, so that&#x27;s where &quot;the answers&quot; lie.",1400943280

There is genuine <i>outrage</i> when sites remove their comments sections.<p>When anybody can publish a URL commenting on another URL, the web is working exactly as it should.

7793417,comment,7791929,7793332,2,0,Zigurd,,,"It&#x27;s good to be optimistic, but the problem is that everything needs oil to be made and to move. Once demand can&#x27;t be met, all parts of the economy bid against each other. Many people won&#x27;t be able to drive to work. Many factories will not be able to make things at affordable prices and will shut down. Food will be vastly more expensive. Fertilizer is made of oil. Many more people will fall out of the middle class. Tens of millions of people, or more, will starve.<p>The overall economic result will be stagflation and there will be nothing that can be done with the spend, tax, or money supply levers. Less oil means a shrinking economy.<p>Energy is wealth. It took over 100 years to build this oil-based economy. We have 20-60 years left to get off oil. If we do not start a production line to mass-produce safe nuclear power plants and find a way to safely reprocess the waste, soon, it isn&#x27;t going to happen in time. We spent trillions on wars and on bailing out an insane derivatives market. Will we have the capital to switch away from oil?",1400942872

The fact that it&#x27;s <i>personally</i> changed you makes the need for humbleness apparent - your spirituality _yours_. It&#x27;s something that helps you find balance, but it clearly doesn&#x27;t work its wonders on everyone. Meanwhile, other methods - meditation being one example - help <i>others</i> find balance, but not everyone as well. Truly, to each their own.<p>To assume that your answer is &quot;the answer that will work for everyone, if only they find it&quot; spits in the face of their beliefs, which is everything they stand for - the same way someone telling you your relationship with God is merely a &quot;solution that works for you.&quot; You have no problems doing this, as you feel that your answer is singularly &quot;correct.&quot; However, this is in fact not the case - there are many others who find their balance doing other things, as users have pointed out.<p>Some people just aren&#x27;t wired to be religious, but find equally effective means for finding balance in their lives.

He was incredibly unprepared and was lost with young kids for ~ 2days. There is a distortion, where map distance and proximity to civilzation gives a false sense of security and we under prepare.<p>These stories are useful. Both to get ideas and to validate/ challenge choices I make when going hiking. To critique it is not to say &quot;Look at that dumass, my hero Bear Grillz would have known what to do...&quot; but rather &quot;Wow - this can happen so easily and relatively close to warm beds, even to experienced folks&quot;<p>And this guy sounds much more experienced than I am. But:<p>When you do this kind of hiking you register the route with someone who expects you to be out by such and such a time... Last hike I wnet on my friend logged our route in a trail book. It is easy for someone to get injured, cross country skiing will give you nasty twists and breaks.<p>Fire equipment? They are in a pine forest and could have gotten a fire going.<p>Also those aluminum foil-like emergency blankets - they are so small and light, there is space in any pack. Came in handy on my last overnight as a sleepingbag liner as the night got colder than expected.<p>How/Why did his feet get wet? Crosscountry ski boots are usually a Gortex-y material with a hard base and a cleat for the bnding. Wonder if he fell in a stream, etc. If so that is time to stop and make a fire. Get warm and dry.<p>I am curious what they were wearing. It was warm enough that some of the streams were not ice covered - so probably below freezing at night but with normal walking they should have stayed warm.<p>Hypothermia can happen when the air temp is quite a bit above freezing esp. - if you are wet.<p>Last winter I was on well marked xcountry ski trails in the Adirondacks (NY State) with my boys and another father and children. The loop took longer than expected  and we spent the last two hours getting back in the dark. No cell service and we got off the skis. I bound all the skis together and carried them and we hiked back.<p>It was well below freezing and was concerned about the little toes and fingers. Since we had registered the hike a snowmobile came out for us and caught us in the last km - didn&#x27;t take us back though, the bastard. :)<p>I did not have a pack on but had compass, firestarter and a few emerg blankets in my coat. I had two small LEDs - I gave one to the other father and we used them to check for blazes and read map. WHen the smowmobile came they were useful for signaling. Plus a metal water bottle to melt snow if needed...<p>So that situation worked out ok. I am not really comparing it to the situation in the article. I was glad to have the foil blankets and firestarter, in case.<p>My wife says I overpack (and she is not wrong). We have animated discussions before going out. \n&quot;Why do you need this rope?&quot; &quot;I dunno - that&#x27;s the point&quot;\n&quot;What are you going to do with this axe?&quot; &quot;Etc...&quot;<p>An overly heavy pack is a liability as well. I could not keep up with my friend on my last overnight. We also had to climb cliffs and I seriously considered tieing off the bag and pulling it up the cliff after I got up. (with the paracord my wife was complaining about - ;) )<p>Also when you fall extra weight increases the impact... And I fall on occaision.

Libel laws are different in every country but this could be quite an influential precedent for many future rulings. It may very well have a large impact for a lot of websites with both comments and user-generated content.<p>If websites choose to enforce a system whereby commenters have to sign up with their verified personal details, many people may be put off and conversation rates could dwindle. This in turn may reduce traffic and said websites may suffer from it.<p>Some websites may choose to forgo commenting systems altogether because they may be too strapped to enforce such a system, or they may be risk-averse and wouldn&#x27;t want to have their necks out anymore after this ruling.<p>A big problem is that a slander lawsuit may hit any time and the only things you can do to prevent it is to moderate the hell out of your UGC. That may not be feasible though. Business insurance against this kind of scenario is crazy expensive and as a business cost may be unrealistic to most.

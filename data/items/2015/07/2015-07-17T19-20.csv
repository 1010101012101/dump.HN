The regulation came in when a dealership showed that a given region had high demand for the company&#x27;s cars, so the company would move in across the street and undercut the franchised dealer. Obviously the franchised dealer had more clout with local politics than the auto manufacturer did - this is why all the dealership laws are state laws.

If the laser-wakefield (or similar) accelerators can pan out, there may be a resurgence of the 1950&#x27;s era of progress.<p>Just because the Standard Model happens to have panned out doesn&#x27;t mean that its experimental verification wasn&#x27;t a triumph. The Standard Model didn&#x27;t have to be true!<p>The solar neutrino thing is phenomenal, at least to me, we surely see CKM mixing in the quark sector, but to see leptons change flavor, and do so on such a grand scale is astounding. When the problem first came up, flavor violation wasn&#x27;t even on the table.<p>Precision cosmology has really laid out that there&#x27;s something really, really big about Physics that we&#x27;re missing. Really big. And it says it with such statistical and systematic vehemence that even the most curmudgeonly skeptic (myself included) is forced to confront it. In combination with the Bullet Cluster, there&#x27;s almost no escape from the conclusion that there&#x27;s something really important to be found.<p>Totally agreed that parameter space, without qualifiers, is a vague term.<p>Some parameter spaces are more important than others. I&#x27;d argue that the absence of new signals at LHC, the absence of bright new lines in Fermi/GLAST data, the absence of new lines in ultra-high energy cosmic rays, the absence of any signal in any EDM experiment, the absence of any equivalence principle violation or anything else in the gravitational sector, the absence of any experimental signal for any dark matter candidate, the continued expected behavior of the Hulse-Taylor pulsar, etc. are all important, especially in light of the problems of CP-violation, the complete incompatibility of the Standard Model with General Relativity, and the extremely good agreement between observed cosmology/BBN with the \LambdaCDM model.<p>A lot of really good people have pushed really hard experimentally on entirely reasonable theories, and those ideas have been severely constrained. In my own field, precision tests of gravity, theory is forced to contort itself to avoid experimental constraint. LHC is putting the screws to supersymmetry; there&#x27;s still plenty of room there, but there&#x27;s a lot less than there was a few years ago.<p>As experimentalists, we&#x27;ve got little patience for contrived models of parameter space.

NASA was sending corrections to New Horizons just hours before its periapsis to Pluto.<p>It would be very different if we launched a satellite and then couldn&#x27;t alter its trajectory in any way (and it would probably impossible to get it to do anything interesting since even the presence of just three bodies can lead to a chaotic system).",1437162890

9904893,comment,9903963,9904639,0,0,tfm,,,"Good question about the precision; we only hear little snippets about hitting virtual windows in space within 100km or so.  New Horizons is running a MIPS-1 R3000 processor[0], that has double-precision floating point available but presumably fixed-point arithmetic could be more suitable here.  But I don&#x27;t know that there would be so much accumulated error, there were a few course corrections between Earth and Pluto.  Maybe the precision is not so much of an issue?<p>As for the fly-by, well.  Speed is a problem.  At the point of closest approach to Pluto it was going at 13.78 km/s, and it&#x27;s about the mass of a grand piano[1] so that&#x27;s about 45TJ of kinetic energy.  Or some large number anyway.  Let&#x27;s just carry on with Newtonian stuff and assume the numbers get worse if you do it properly.  At current speed its orbital radius[2] would be about ... 4600 metres.  Three miles!<p>That&#x27;s somewhere deep within the icy core, I&#x27;m guessing.<p>In order to orbit at the distance of the photos we&#x27;re getting now, it would need to slow right down to 264m/s, shedding basically all of that kinetic energy.  Back of the envelope numbers suggest that would require about the equivalent of a 90 megaton explosion!  Of course, if we strapped the Tsar Bomba[3] onto New Horizons, there would be more mass, so we&#x27;d need more stopping power ... and so on.<p>Other reasons for doing a flyby, I suspect, is that we get to see more stuff this way.  There are a few moons, and an uncharted Kuiper Belt.  Seems a shame to come all this way and only see the one thing.  Not to mention the allure of the tantalising glimpse ... always leave them wanting more!  This mission started with Pluto being nothing but a blurry dot occupying a dozen pixels.  Imagine what the next mission can do, based on what we&#x27;re already learning!  Iterate and improve.<p>[0] <a href=""http://blog.imgtec.com/mips-processors/mips-goes-to-pluto"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.imgtec.com/mips-processors/mips-goes-to-pluto</a>

The sender must know the email address of the receiver, and that step -- getting to know the email address of the receiver -- is not supported in the protocol itself.<p>In other words, email is not &quot;near-universal&quot; and entirely open, because the receiver must give you his email address, by means of which he is consenting to receive your emails.<p>---<p>In any protocol where the message stayed at the sender&#x27;s server and could be fetched by an authorized potential receiver (such as the one I linked to, with variations introduced by my imagination) there could be ways to quickly &quot;get&quot; one&#x27;s email address, like today we do by reading the address itself.<p>For example, instead of showing a written email address in his website, one could show a link to third-party identification/message-request authority which would be in charge of filtering these things and letting the potential receiver choose what he would want to receive. This introduces the problem of spam again, but at least it is outside of the main protocol, and the protocol could live without it.<p>Another solution, now thinking specifically about the &quot;streams&quot; (see my previous link) protocol, is that each person willing to accept email from new people could open public streams -- and yes, they would be subjected to spam, but since the receiver would have absolute control of that stream and what does its server does with the messages, it could enforce a strict format (for example, every message could only be &quot;let me talk to you, add my stream at ____&quot;), and it could change its address from time to time. The customizability of the thing would be its main feature, since no spammer machine would be able to go into all these personal standards.<p>Also, having a public communication channel that is restricted to messages that say &quot;I want to talk to you&quot; is going to totally inhibit spammer behavior. No spammer will spend time trying to get people to talk to him. It will filter out machines and let only people.<p>In any way, the social introduction, as you called it, can exist, and does not have to be supported by the protocol (although, like in my second example, it could be done though the protocol). Supporting it as a feature of the protocol would only make it more automatable and easy for spammers.<p>---<p>I&#x27;ve just came up with these ideas while writing, so there are probably a lot of problems, but the main point was that there is always a pre-protocol social introduction, and that can be bad or good depending on how things work. Probably with email it was good to just give your address to everybody on the internet some years ago, but now just by writing it in a post you&#x27;re going to be massively spammed.",1437162523

And to be clear, for the condition it targeted, an incorrect diagnosis would kill.  The approval was slow, expensive, and cumbersome.  I absolutely support it.  Consider the average code quality you see with every piece of software you touch.  Hell, even apple can&#x27;t update their iphones -- with very few models to test -- without killing wireless on some of them.  The FDA required that your code was tested so that given certain inputs, it produced correct outputs every single time, and documentation to that effect.<p>I wish we could speed the process up, but I think it&#x27;s the best alternative we have going.<p>edit: this was my first serious dev job.  They didn&#x27;t use source control.  &quot;source control&quot; was a random computer holding the master copy; after a month or two of development, you&#x27;d spend a couple days merging your code into the master copy then copy the merged codebase to your desktop.  All 8 devs did this.  There were wild merge problems, as you can imagine with that much divergence.  &quot;History tracking&quot; was copying the entire directory structure to a series of labeled directories.<p>There were two ways to license the machines: one for human testing (with fda approval), and one for non-human testing.  The latter got releases every 3-6 mos.  One at least one occasion, code was shipped so broken that it conclusively proved it had never been successfully <i>run</i>, not even once.  The &quot;deploy&quot; process was to copy code from the master server, hit build in visual studio, and burn that to cds.<p>Automated tests?  What are those?  Test suites were run instructions written in a spiral notebook.  (To be fair, it&#x27;s hard to work with bio samples.)<p>I wrote a bunch of code that basically mocked the device by installed a special driver that replayed saved data files.  I wrote this on my own time so I could occasionally work from home without lugging a giant contaminated machine back and forth.  I shared it with coworkers and it eventually made its way to the testing lab on the other side of the country without my knowledge.  When I quit, I deleted all source code.  It turns out they hadn&#x27;t kept a copy of this driver and frantically contacted me several months after I left when an embedded system upgrade broke it.<p>Many of these are symptoms of a company run by bio scientists who viewed engineering as a cost center and barely even a real career.

9904730,comment,9903739,9904339,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Well, since it&#x27;s unenforceable, you can safely ignore it. The loser here is the government in that it&#x27;s being slapped for failing to consider everyone&#x27;s interests when drafting legislation - the ruling is not that ripping is bad, but there&#x27;s no governmental mechanism for measuring or mitigating the impact on content providers. In short, it&#x27;s not about you.<p>What the court is basically telling the government to do is to assign permanent responsibility to someone in the civil service (or set up some similar mechanism) for tracking the degree of copyright infringement that occurs and compensating injured parties, who are citizens or corporations in good standing with legal rights of their own. The government can&#x27;t just facilitate a practice which will foreseeably result in some injury to one group of people and then leave that group at a legal disadvantage; it creates the opposite of a level playing field by saying that some peoples&#x27; economic interests are less important than others.<p>A lot of people make the argument that technology has changed the market, so content producers shouldn&#x27;t expect to have their incomes protected, because we didn&#x27;t protect the manufacture of buggy whips in response to the popularity of modern cars. But this is flawed reasoning. In a case like that, demand shifted away from horse-drawn vehicles (and their peripheral goods like buggy whips) towards mechanically-powered ones. In the case of music and movies, demand for the <i>product</i> has <i>not</i> shifted to something else - people still love to consume music, watch movies etc. What&#x27;s different is that you can now frequently get the <i>same</i> product you wanted before, at the same level of quality, and enjoy it the same way, but without paying for it, if you are so inclined. In this case, technology hasn&#x27;t altered the product itself, but rather the economic relations of product distribution.<p>So even if you are super cutting-edge as an artist/publisher, and you decide to make high-quality, device-agnostic digital copies of your work available to consumers from day 1, you are <i>still</i> faced with the problem that some consumers will decide to upload it to file-sharing sites, and many others will choose to download it and subsequently enjoy it without bothering to pay anything while you watch your sales dry up. The equilibrium price asymptotically approaches zero because sellers no longer have any control over the supply curve, so all of the economic surplus goes to consumers and little or none goes to producers, who are thus disincentivized from further creation because they are no longer able to make a living as before <i>even though</i> demand <i>for their product may be as strong as ever</i>.<p>Interestingly, when electronic music - ie recordings of electronic oscillators, filters and modulators, bleeps and bloops - first got going in the UK in the 1950s, the first creators were unable to get artistic credit because the body that administers royalties wouldn&#x27;t accept the output as music or recognize a creative input, partly out of fear that mechanically produced music would destroy jobs for musicians who played conventional instruments, and in the 1980s there was a pushback from the musician&#x27;s union against multi-timbral synthesizers/sequencers that could replace whole groups of musicians. Those really are anti-technology, anti-market initiatives but they ultimately went nowhere, notwithstanding that the rise in popularity of electronic music did result in some economic displacement.",1437161218

9904686,comment,9903340,9903340,0,0,cooper12,,,"Nice writeup, the dominant color approach looks promising. I&#x27;ve also tried something similar using averaging.<p>Not sure if this is any better than your solution, but my approach with ffmpeg was this command:<p><pre><code>    ffmpeg -i &quot;$myvideo&quot; -r 1 -threads 4 -s 320x240 -vcodec mjpeg img%04d.jpg
</code></pre>
The -r flag sets the framerate to 1, which in my understanding gets a frame per second. I also used all the cores of my laptop. The -s flag just does the same thing as your filter, though in my case I also fudged the aspect ratio of the resulting frames. I chose to save in jpeg to save some minuscule space.<p>In my approach I squashed each frame horizontally to one pixel, so I get vertical slivers that average each frame. Then I just added them all together horizontally. Here is the result of that for Requiem for a Dream before resizing [0] and after [1] to get a better overview. In terms of usefulness it might not give too much information, but it&#x27;s nice to look at and sometimes you can even spot individual scenes.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/SgpYOoD.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/SgpYOoD.jpg</a>

Having spent a significant portion of my career agency-side, I can say that agencies tend to be low-margin, serviced-based businesses, and that tends to suck for their employees.  This is because the easiest lever to pull to improve the bottom line is assigning more work to the same number of people (or fewer).<p>I learned a massive amount in the agency environment due to my bird&#x27;s eye view of the industry and best practices across numerous best in class clients.  But I can confidently say that being client-side is almost always a better work/life balance, and typically better pay as well. Doubly so if you are at a high-margin, product-based company.<p>As such, the sales pitch to recruit agency talent is typically quite easy if you are actually offering a competitive salary and have healthy work/life balance at your company.  Hell, simply mentioning &quot;competitive salary&quot; and &quot;healthy work/life balance&quot; in the same sentence may be enough to get them salivating.<p>But overall, I would agree that marketing as a profession tends to get a bad rap out here.  There are good marketers and bad, just as in any profession.  Unfortunately, given that the barrier to entry into the field is significantly lower than some other professions, it is not uncommon for folks to have encountered really bad marketers.<p>In my mind, a solid modern-day marketer needs to:<p>- Be able to model things in Excel in their sleep<p>- Have strong working knowledge (if not deep technical knowledge) of how data flows between various platforms, the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of said data, and when to trust your instincts over the data<p>- Have some technical knowledge or at the very least be able to have an intelligent conversation with the engineers and PMs who are typically responsible for implementing what marketing is asking for<p>Those are a starting point in my mind.  Some might argue there are strong marketers out there who lack these skills.  I would argue they may be strong in some areas, but their skills are not current or fully fleshed out.",1437160644

This isn&#x27;t just on the theory side; experimentalists are looking at topological states of matter for a variety of applications, including quantum computing.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_field_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_field_theo...</a>",1437160635

There is no justification for that.<p>Most non-proliferation activists, Obama included, have the stated goal of a &quot;world without nuclear weapons&quot;, in which the US and Russia also bring their stockpiles down to zero. Superpowers are already wealthy enough to win wars by conventional means, and they have the most to lose from rogue nuclear strikes, so they have strong incentives to work in this direction.<p>That said the fact of the matter is that the US and Russia <i>do</i> have large nuclear stockpiles, and don&#x27;t like each other very much, so coordinating simultaneous arms reductions is a tricky game-theoretic dance. Hopefully we&#x27;ll get there, but it may take a long time. While that progresses, preventing new nuclear powers from springing up is an equally important part of the nonproliferation agenda.<p>> If you don&#x27;t want them to have nuclear weapons provide them incentives.<p>That&#x27;s exactly what the sanctions regime against Iran has been: a set of incentives engineered so that giving up nukes is in their best interest.",1437160331

Later improved teaching can figure out ways to get free of the chronology of the original story, and just teach the plain fact.<p>While Darwin&#x27;s finches are still sometimes mentioned when teaching evolution, the whole story of measuring all kinds of properties of those birds in different islands, and presenting this data, and what can we deduct from it, is rarely presented. We just jump to the main point: species adapt and evolve.<p>Arguable, teaching <i>physics</i> still almost everyplace follows the historical chronology: mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, which usually pushes quantum mechanics to the 3rd year in a university. The mathematical machinery of quantum mechanics however shouldn&#x27;t take two full years to master, so maybe there could be a route to proceed quantum mechanics faster, not trying to cover all of classical physics first.<p>(3) I assume the success of future researchers is party build upon that they had access to good teachers, or good textbooks, which made it possible for them to quickly absorb the present state of knowledge. But there are voices complaining that producing good teaching material is not incentivized in the present academic system.",1437160317

Correction : we have zero (except Omar Sy). We don&#x27;t deal well with race in France, in a sense that we can&#x27;t say we have an established racism, but a lot of small discriminations.<p>Tonjé and I are media guys. Tonjé wrote scenario, produce shows, directed a theater. The problem we see is that we don&#x27;t have positive heroes. Basically : why could we not have a black James Bond ?<p>Our answer is Afrostream : to represent African descents in a positive way, in all their diversities (because, yes, black culture does not exist).<p>South African movies are definitely in our radar. I loved &quot;Zulu&quot; movie (I am sort of movie geek too),
We will look at Egyptian movies too, because, why not.<p>We intend to have all of the diversities of the culture from African descents. African American movies are popular and will be on Afrostream. Nollywood, the movies from Nigeria, will be there too. We did and will do a big work of curation to unite the best of the African Diaspora. Because our goals are not just to show some movies on your smartphone, but to make learn about some culturees which are sometimes just ignored today.

Instead of a standard fuse that just melts past a certain amperage, which means you aren’t exactly sure when it will or won’t melt or if it will arc when it does, we developed a fuse with its own electronics and a tiny lithium-ion battery. It constantly monitors current at the millisecond level and is pyro-actuated to cut power with extreme precision and certainty.<p>That was combined with upgrading the main pack contractor to use inconel (a high temperature space-grade superalloy) instead of steel, so that it remains springy under the heat of heavy current.<p>The net result is that we can safely increase max amp throughout from 1300 to 1500 Amps.

I&#x27;m sure today we would have used a Raft-based system, but that was not available when we did this work, so we used ZooKeeper.  We haven&#x27;t spent much time polishing Manatee for general consumption, but there&#x27;s a write-up on how it maintains consistency[1].  The actual component is available here[2], and it&#x27;s also been ported to Go as part of Flynn[3].<p>Edit: Manatee uses synchronous replication, not async, so it does not lose data on failover.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/joyent/manatee-state-machine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/joyent/manatee-state-machine</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/joyent/manatee"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/joyent/manatee</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/flynn/flynn"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/flynn/flynn</a>",1437159840

9904577,comment,9903831,9903994,0,0,xenadu02,,,"I agree. It would be far more efficient to have the government provide a baseline level of services to everyone. Then the vast majority of small companies and startups employing contractors wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about it.<p>We already have a baseline level of retirement covered with Social Security. Companies who want to attract more talented employees offer enhanced retirement benefits in 401k plans or other incentives like stock options.<p>I propose we should give everyone healthcare regardless of employment; the exchanges should be open to all and offer Medicare as the baseline plan for free to anyone who wants it. I further propose that the government provide unemployment that matches your salary for 3 months, 80% for 9 months, then 50% for a year. I also propose free training and schooling so people can switch careers if needed. Now getting fired or &quot;laid off&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean destitution... it means time to find a new job or go back to school to train for a different one. Then employers can be free of a lot of these pesky &quot;regulations&quot; and &quot;taxes&quot;. We can pay for it by soaking billionaires with taxes which won&#x27;t have any negative effect on our economy because we are overflowing with capital seeking return right now (and have been for 15-20 years). The only downside is listening to them whine and moan about how oppressed they are because they&#x27;re money-penis isn&#x27;t as big as they&#x27;d like.<p>... or were you just talking about fucking over everyone but the billionaires?

If you want to become the best at what you do, you must surround yourself with people smarter, more experienced, and more capable than you. So, go to the company from whom you can learn the most. If a particular startup has an experienced / innovative team, go there. If you find the same thing at a corporate giant, go there. I started my career at a startup, but found I quickly exhausted their expertise since their team was &#x27;limited&#x27; in experience, capability, etc. So I ended up at a Fortune 500 where there were thousands of engineers to learn from. In the developer world, it might be completely opposite - the good ones are at startups. Just as employers pick their employees carefully, you should pick your employer carefully :)",1437159654

You need a second camera and, at worst, potentially a second operator to worry over it.<p>Secondly, it's more error prone. Copying the VGA feed off the video switcher will fail in hilarious ways/also require a second person whose job it is to look over it.<p>I've thrown two conferences, and been responsible for front of the house AV for a total of three and a half.

This code highlights the new cKanren extensions Claire et. al. have developed which enables Constraint Logic Programming in miniKanren - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_logic_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_logic_programming</a>.<p>One neat bit about this is that this is surprisingly efficient given the generality and how new this work is. The HN crowd will be familiar with Norvig's fantastic sudoku solver in Python - <a href=""http://norvig.com/sudoku.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/sudoku.html</a>. This core.logic solver can solve easy sudoku problems ~6-7ms. Norvig's hard one that takes 188 seconds in Python takes ~60ms. More benchmarking needs to be done, but this is promising especially since this is a generic all-different FD constraint over small domains as well as intervals - so it's not specific to sudoku.<p>Feel free to ask any questions.<p>UPDATE: to be extra clear this is not just about sudoku. The following is also now possible to express under the same framework -<p><pre><code>  (run* [q]\n    (fresh [x y z]\n      (infd x y z (interval 1 3))\n      (+fd x y z)\n      (== q [x y z])))\n  ;; => ([1 1 2] [2 1 3] [1 2 3])\n</code></pre>\nThis program shows all possibilities where x, y & z range over 1, 2, 3 where x & y add up to z.",1343858327

However, we believe these are solvable. It comes down to two things - one is proper training of the drivers and using technology as much as possible to eliminate chances of errors.<p>That is too high level. Let me explain more clearly for one specific case of order substitution. Since we are focusing on a niche (groceries), our system has already calculated the substitutes of items. We know how to substitute a Store Brand Ketchup to Heinz IF needed.<p>A lot of what I know about logistics is from my time at Amazon Supply Chain, where I dealt specifically with the challenge of fulfilling packages to the customer from AMZN FCs (aka warehouses). And, at Instacart we believe we can have the same efficiencies IF we model the stores in a city just like AMZN modeled warehouses across the world.",1343858276

Also realize that even if you are programming with GUI components, you still have to create new components sometimes, so you are still programming and still a programmer.<p>I have a very early rough draft system that I am throwing together on my own, mostly because very few people seem to be able to appreciate these concepts.

You could argue the subscriber drops of previous years were due to IP video but now that the numbers are on the rebound that seems unlikely unless people switched to IP video exclusively and found it to be inadequate. It's also important to look at Comcast (and others) own IP video solutions which are not talked about a lot but may fill the void that would otherwise send customers into IP-only solutions. If you have Comcast and you want to watch TV on your iPad the easiest way is to just use the XFINITY TV app. The cable MSOs were very slow to take IP video seriously but, IMO, they are in much better shape now. I'm sure HBO is aware of this too. They are betting that bundled linear/IP services are going to be the way most customers consume media.",1343856373

Having that mentality from day one allowed them to make huge concessions to users such as give them free delivery on everything, and not have a minimum order. For example, you could pay $1.50 for a gum on Kozmo and get it delivered to you within an hour. WebVan, on the other hand spend $1B on building it's own warehouses and fulfillment infrastructure.<p>Learning from those companies, we have done a lot of things differently. For starters, there is a minimum order of $10. There is a delivery fee of $3.99 for 3 hours and $9.99 for 1 hour. (Would you not pay $4 for someone to do all your groceries?) And, we do not hold any inventory - all of it is sourced directly from local retailers.<p>It is also important to mention that the time that we live in is very different. People are a lot more comfortable adding their credit card information on web/mobile. Not to mention, the access to smart phones that people have gives customers the ability to shop from anywhere - office, couch, next to the fridge.<p>We believe we are different from the companies that have tried this in the past.

They are loaded differently, spin at different rates, and so on. But most obviously, 7.62x39 is almost twice the diameter of 5.56.<p>7.62x39 is probably much more comparable to the .308 Winchester [1] typically used for hunting larger game. According to wikipedia, ""the .308 Winchester has become the most popular short-action, big-game hunting cartridge worldwide"".<p>Now, circling back to my original point about the AR-15 (or, really, the 5.56mm cartridge it shoots) being low-power, wikipedia lists the energy of the energy of the .308 bullet at 3600J-3900K, nearly <i>triple</i> the power of the 5.56mm.<p>So I stand by my claim that the AR-15 is a <i>low-power</i> rifle.<p><i>You can purchase non-NATO 5.56/.223 ammo for hunting, and are typically required to use it when hunting game.</i><p>This is absolutely false. 5.56mm ammunition is too small for hunting deer, bear, etc. You've got to be a very good shot to take down large animals with something bearing so little energy. That's why hunters tend to use rounds in the .30cal range -- like the .308 I mentioned, and also very commonly the 7.62x39 from the AK, but when hunting it's probably being shot out of an SKS [2]. Wikipedia verifies that ""In the early 1990s, the Chinese SKS rapidly became the ""poor man's deer rifle"" in some Southern areas of the United States"".<p>So there are a variety of <i>larger</i> cartridges used for hunting larger game, generally in the .30cal neighborhood or more, because the 5.56mm/.223 cartridge just doesn't carry enough energy to take down the big animals.<p>(looks like someone changed the wikipedia link on me!

It's possible that if I were to ignore this rule, I'd have enough spare disk bandwidth to do at least half-assed backups (I'm not doing any backups of customer data right now, which is pretty scary for me, because I'm in a business where if you lose the customer's data, you lose the customer in the worst way.)<p>Now, the right way to solve this problem is some kind of 'snapshot over the network' like zfs has or some other mechanisim that only transfers the change in block devices.  Unfortunately, Linux has no such tools.   (yes, yes, ZFS on linux is a possibility.  So is a NAS.  Rsync or something rsync like won't work because the problem is not network bandwidth but disk bandwidth.   I mean, it's a problem that can be solved, a better way, but solving it the better way is more work.)<p>Next, from a technical support perspective?  I could provide dramatically better service if I logged all the serial consoles.   Dramatically better service.  but last time I asked, people seemed uncomfortable with it, so I don't.   (the thing is, it's only easy to log all consoles or log none of the consoles;  I'd have to spend time and effort building a 'log consoles except for users that opt out' mechanisim, which is the right thing to do here, but due to time constraints that hasn't been done.)    (to be clear, when a customer asks for help, or even if soemthing happens with a domain and I'm not sure it's working, I look at the serial console as is.  My job would be nigh impossible without serial consoles.   Also, by default I log the serial consoles on dedicated servers, though unlike Xen, it is easy for me to opt people out of that.  Conserver is the tool I use there.)<p>Personally, I think I made the right choice when it comes to block devices (I have had good luck with my RAIDs, and treating disks as block devices means my customers can use whatever freaky filesystem they like.)  but I think I made the wrong choice on the serial console;  there really isn't that much personal stuff that comes up on the serial console, and it gives me a lot of clues.<p>I guess what I'm saying is that from a testing perspective?  being able to see the user's bookmarks has a lot of advantages.   It's a valid choice; and he's sharing that choice with the customers, which is the right thing to do.<p>(the interesting thing here, of course, was that if his account couldn't see the users bookmarks, while usually that would have given him much less diagnostic information, it would have given him more diagnostic information this time.)",1343855801

(Most delivery systems in use today rely on some kind of hub-and-spoke design.)  Perhaps the wide adoption of smart phones will make point-to-point delivery economically viable for Instacart -- e.g., by giving the company cost-effective access to underused delivery vehicles as needed to satisfy the ebbs and flows of consumer demand.<p>I'm curious to see if and how Instacart can pull it off.<p>--<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozmo.com#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozmo.com#History</a>",1343855363

Hacker News of which I have been a member for a number of years has always been a great place to go where you get good actionable comments and discussion on topics.  This thread however is typical of the 'new' Hacker News, a place where users want to snipe at other users and find negative aspects to things submitted.  BusterKeaton has gone to the extent of creating a throwaway Hacker News profile to point out disparities in an interesting project that had no ulterior motive - just an idea that stemmed from a book that may also apply to a website.  Why pick it apart to try to find something wrong with it ?  Why then try to discredit one of the founders with threats about his current employer ?  Hacker News was always a place where like minded people could gather to discuss and showcase interesting projects, often for people who are employed outside of these projects and who are trying to better their lives with interesting and thought provoking projects.  Hacker News now unfortunately is a place where <i>some</i> of it's users are trying to discredit and prove a point.  This is a very sad day and has forever tainted my view of Hacker News and reinforces my view that Hacker News is certainly not the place it once was and albeit there a lot of great users with interesting commentary and interesting projects to showcase there are a lot of individuals who want to prove a point, belittle others and generally snipe.",1343855329

If you have 10 calls to ListenAndServe, it's implied that you're in 10 different, concurrently running processes (goroutines).  A panic, in Go, does not cross a goroutine boundary.  If, in imaginary parallel universe Go with exceptions, exceptions did cross goroutine boundaries, then one goroutine could crash another goroutine.<p>The point of Go is to be able to sensibly write stable, concurrent programs with compile-time safety.  Exception-based error handling would be a mess with Go's concurrency model.<p>In practice, you would only call ListenAndServe 10 times if you were listening on 10 different ports, because you had 10 different projects on the same server.  That's a perfectly realistic situation.  Now consider that one site has an error and throws an exception.  Should all the other sites go down?<p>Error handling in Go is admittedly tedious, but when you work with the language for a bit you'll start to understand why they chose to design it in that manner.",1343855191

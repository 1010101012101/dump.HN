If some bean counter at Netflix tells their board next year that they the current cost/benefit ratio for EC2 now makes no sense it would take Netflix less than a month to move to another cloud provider and less than six months to move everything in-house again.</i><p>if this were true, netflix would have never moved to the cloud in the first place, because like I said, even right now, at scale that is ridiculously small compared to neflix, it's pretty easy to beat amazon on price.<p>Now, first, I mostly agree with your assessment, if we limit the field to smaller companies where the people who own it are still involved with running it, and where people in positions of power have experience running cheap data centers.<p>But, I think the rules are different for ""the enterprise."" many of the large enterprises I've worked for ended up paying many times over what a company with more data center experience on the board (or in the beancounters) would would pay for compute infrastructure.   You've seen the enterprise sales process... the whole system is set up to extract as much money as possible from the enterprise in question.<p>I saw one company that was paying a thousand bucks a month for mid-spec servers to a well-known infrastructure outsourcing company;   servers that would cost me close to $2000 total capital cost, and then $100/month in power/bandwidth.  According to this company's bean counters, paying that huge premium was actually cheaper for the company than buying and hosting in-house.<p>As for moving from amazon to another outsourced infrastructure provider... well, the problem is one of sales.  Amazon is the only company in it's space that I know (with the exception of rackspace, maybe?)  that has the credibility to be used by the enterprise without sending a sales guy over.

Due to the overbooking, limited lab space, and the pre-req status, the prof decided to give preference to the upperclassman that didn't have any other chance to get the class in. As the only freshman, I was out.  As were all the sophomores.<p>But I didn't pout or run off like the others did.  I stayed long enough to take the first day shop tour, where I put phase II of my plan in play.<p>I'd been hanging around the lab/shop in question off and on for several weeks before and had gotten friendly with Marty, the shop instructor.  When he saw me in the class tour and learned that I was out because of the overbooking, he offered to the prof to stretch the shop rules and let me in anyway (knowing that I wouldn't require much supervision).<p>Victory over the system as a freshman!<p>Needless to say, many of the sophomores came by and griped about it later.  I'm not sure if they were mad at me for bending the rules, or themselves for not thinking of it first.",1287848606

I can't imagine Microsoft selling Word/Excel/PowerPoint a la carte for even twice that price; they'd be reaping far lower margins than they're used to getting for Office. And I don't think they can do a heavily stripped-down version, either: it'd still take a ton of work and would be even more directly going up against iWork. What's the point?<p>But if I were the head of the Mac Business Unit, I wouldn't want to tell Ballmer that we have no plans whatsoever and are just going to cede what's been one of our very most profitable markets on what appears to be one of the most important platforms going forward.<p>And, of course, they're about to run into a somewhat similar issue with the Mac App Store: Mac iWork apps appear to be going a la carte with on-demand instant gratification on what I expect will be the primary channel for users to get Mac apps within a couple of years.

Several game companies I have interviewed at make linear algebra a very big part of their technical interview process.  IMO if you are even remotely comfortable with math, learning matrix math is a HUGE benefit (maybe even a necessity) if you want a serious job as a game developer... the easiest way to get going with it is to just take a university-level intro to linear algebra course.

Primo Facto being the availability of off the shelf libraries and integrations with other technologies.<p>As for JSP, JSF, Struts, tag-libs, tiles, velocity and all of the other Java web technologies, my personal opinion is they are the worst of the worst. I would say working in PHP is preferable to having to work in them and I do not like PHP at all. For me, I stopped using server side languages all together and write my UI with HTML / CSS / JavaScript. This gives me the ability to plug into any back end technology and allows me to keep the UI agnostic of any non-web technology (e.g. JSP, ASP, PHP).<p>In the way that we build web apps, Java works well, we use JAX-RS to expose REST services. and then use Java to integrate all of the back end pieces together. As a language it does leave a deal to be desired but I don't think that those lackings are a killer for it. I think the Java web stack was a killer and pushed a lot of people to PHP, as it was so intrusive as to be almost abusive to the designer. It favors the developer over the designer and it is evident in it's design.<p>The old web frameworks chose the designer or the developer this is evident in the various takes on how to do the web on the server. One only needs to look at the contrast between PHP and Java Web to see the evidence. You can see which one each favors pretty quickly.<p>The thing I like about the way we do things now, is we exploit the advantages of Javascript and it's rapid development capabilities that better suit a UX designer on the front end. As well as exploit the rigor that the back end developer needs with Java and transactions, guaranteed rollback, dead recipient and all of the other standards that guarantee that something does not fall through the crack.<p>Anyway, I don't see Java as dead I just think it will play a more out of sight role in the future but I think the same can be said for a lot of server side technologies. JavaScript web apps are growing by leaps and bounds, it has its detractors but most that actually try it, see the advantages pretty quickly and convert, it takes far less time to deliver and provides a superior result. It is the way that the industry is heading. I think that is a far more important decision than whether or not you use Java as your back end.",1287847720

I don't do C# nor deploy against .NET and it would take a lot of convincing before being allowed to deploy a Windows server in our farm. Even a deployment on Mono would have to be justified, since there isn't much difference, application-wise, between a Mono stack and a Java one.",1287846659

The second half, though -<p>> On the other hand by hastening the end of the war and preventing future wars (by informing the public of the horrors), the upside is solid.<p>Letting Iraq break into regional sectarian rule would be a disaster. Foreign forces need to be there until locally trained police and military forces are able to keep rule of law in Iraq. Letting the place become a failed state would be very bad for all parties involved from almost all perspectives - it would probably cost more American money and lives in the long run [1], and certainly would result in oppression, violence, and misery for Iraqis.<p>[1] If a country gets a reputation for withdrawing under pressure if wars aren't won fast, that encourages enemies during a conflict to fight a slow war of attrition, which is the bloodiest, nastiest, most expensive kind of war. Now, the response to this might be ""well, America shouldn't fight wars any more then!"" - but, realistically looking at America's history and demographics, I would bet on continuing to have an armed conflict every 10-20 years or so. Those will become nastier and more drawn out if the United States gets a reputation for withdrawing if an insurgency causes problems long enough.",1287846462

Though a while later I went to put something in the recycling bin just outside our backdoor and just before it slammed shut I realised it was locked though it was too late. I definitely didn't want to be stuck outside waiting for someone else to come home.<p>We had a new evaporative cooling system which means you have to have a few windows open, though they were all locked open a jar.  It was certainly frustrating being able to feel the nice cool air flowing out of the window onto my face and it wasn't enough in the heat.<p>I tried reaching through the window with various instruments such as bamboo sticks, broom handles, etc. that we had lying around but nothing was long enough to reach my keys.  I tried a piece of plank but not only was it too short but I wouldn't have been able to manoeuvre it anyway.  At that point I was thinking I was doomed.  Fortunately we had a new kitchen ceiling put in and it suddenly occurred to me that we had some 5m long pieces of ceiling pine timber on the front verandah.<p>I lugged one around to my bedroom window and the length of pine was not only long enough but thinner and far more flexible than the plank.  I was able to drag the keys off my desk and across the floor near the window.  Then used a bamboo stick to fish them out from there.<p>I was probably stuck outside for 30-40 minutes in the end, though it was a good several hours before anyone else came home.",1287846289

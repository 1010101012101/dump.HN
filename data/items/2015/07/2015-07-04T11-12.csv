9829880,comment,9829662,9829826,0,0,xiaq,,,"Plan 9 makes extensive use of pure-text IPC, more commonly known as file writes and reads. This is facilitated by the fact that each process sees its own filesystem hierarchy.<p>For instance, GUI programs are built by reading from files like /dev/cons and /dev/mouse and writing to files under /dev/draw. Now it seems that this will end up in a mess when you try to run multiple GUI programs, but that is not the case - a WM can provide virtualized versions of these files, and each program still feels that it is using the entire screen and does not need to know about the WM at all. My description is likely not very accurate because I haven&#x27;t really tried it, but you can find the whole story in the related man pages: <a href=""http://man.cat-v.org/plan_9/3/cons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://man.cat-v.org/plan_9/3/cons</a> <a href=""http://man.cat-v.org/plan_9/3/mouse"" rel=""nofollow"">http://man.cat-v.org/plan_9/3/mouse</a> <a href=""http://man.cat-v.org/plan_9/3/draw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://man.cat-v.org/plan_9/3/draw</a>.<p>Another example is the authentication facility of plan 9. Instead of being a dynamically-linked library, it is a separate process that can be reached via IPC. Russ Cox et al have a talk on this (<a href=""https://swtch.com/~rsc/talks/nauth.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://swtch.com/~rsc/talks/nauth.pdf</a>).<p>This is also why Plan 9 has no dynamic linking, since those things are done with IPC instead.",1436009553

It makes appreciating their actual art works, the actual form and content of their of their work, much more difficult. It is a categorization without any other distinction other than &quot;I saw this in a magazine or a book, or on a computer screen. How can it have any merit as real art?&quot;<p>Illustrators and printmakers are seen as &quot;artists for rent&quot; and their work is not taken seriously.<p>MC Escher was a great draughtsman whose work had a very distinct personality and outlook. He was a very skilled 2D designer, his work has &quot;presence&quot;, which is a purposefully nebulous phrase by which I mean that it radiates a particular point-of-view. It vibrates with an energy in a way that pulls you into the work. It is a marriage of great skill, great execution and more importantly, great vision. Works with presence become a small world to you while you examine them. there are many, many artists whose works have this quality. It is a force that makes no distinction between &quot;modern&quot; (non-objective) art and &quot;traditional&quot; (objective) art.<p>MC Escher may not be one&#x27;s cup of tea, or speak to everyone the way he speaks to me, but to write off and classify and entire world of images as inferior simply because they were meant to be reproduced is just short-sighted.<p>I know people will argue that there were great painters that also made prints and they are appreciated as fine art, and I agree that there are degrees to this prejudice. I think it has more to do with the perception of a particular artist&#x27;s primary purpose. Escher was classified by the art establishment as &quot;that guy who does those realistic illusion prints&quot; and then was never taken seriously after that.<p>It may also be the old 20th century prejudice (now coming back around, I think) against objective art. The baby had to be thrown out with the bath water in order for everyone to feel good about not actually going to art school and working hard at a craft.<p>(Jeez, sorry for the wide-ranging bitterness there!

If you compare to GPU in the same price range, you end-up with K40 or K80, who have a peak at 4.3TFLOPS SP and 5.6TFLOPS SP respectively, much higher than Stratix 10. Moreover, FPGA are not really good at double precision FP, which is important in many HPC area.
At the end of the day, the important metric is FLOPS/$, and more importantly what you can achieve for your application and tooling and ecosystem. Many scientists are not computer science experts, and many HPC codes are legacy simulations which can be hard to port and re-validate.

When we were talking about logic in class a year ago, we showed the teacher how you can do this in Minecraft and he really liked the idea.<p>It really does take some time to learn enough about redstone to be able to come up with your own designs - partly because redstone is <i>very</i> weird when you take a closer look - but I think it&#x27;s worth it, at least for logic / problem solving in general.<p>There already are a few servers that focus on Redstone only, lots of smart (and young) people there.",1436008111
9829845,comment,9829025,9829289,0,0,rakoo,,,"I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that if you actually look at it, the universal structure in Go is not interface{}, it&#x27;s []byte. Anybody can read from and write to a []byte. Everything else is just a crutch to make things more bearable, but in the end, you will deal with []byte. In this sense Go kind of feels sad because []byte is far from having all the information you need, and if you want a &quot;generic&quot; B-tree that only handles []byte, you will waste a lot of time (un)marshalling.<p>Perhaps one of the design decisions was to make this cost clear to the developer.

3390536,comment,3390471,3390471,5,0,dodedo,,,"This guy doesn't get it. Here are his two main misunderstandings:<p>1) Every artist who's made an online release of their content in a desirable format (without DRM, etc) has seen sales in proportion to their general popularity. Every single one, without even one exception. The author claims Louis got an ""inordinate"" amount of attention, but I'm not sure this is the case. I suspect the same level of buzz would have been generated had he somehow managed to produce a DVD at the $5 price point with identical content.<p>2) Popularity is derived from interesting media products. There's no mumbo-jumbo about old media/new media. If you've produced something interesting and compelling, people will want to talk about it. Attributing the acquisition of fame to ""traditional media"" is brainless. Old media is no different than so called new media -- they both carry stories of interest relative to the level of interest.<p>And there are countless examples of folks who've generated their own buzz by producing a compelling product, as folks on HN should know better than anyone. You can buy a bit of publicity, but it's compelling, interesting and memorable content that creates a true monetizable spot in the public's consciousness. This is very repeatable and it is done daily.",1324792687

At the time browser development was stagnant an Google needed the technology to advance in order to improve their web applications and compete with the old desktop software model.<p>Chrome is an extension of that effort and has played a large part in driving adoption of new web technology.<p>But I don't buy the part about Google not being as interested in having users. Chrome is the operating system that runs the Google applications. They have increased their marketing spend this year by 69% to $4.9 billion dollars.<p>Google, marketing, something they never used to do and were known for not spending on. A lot of that marketing is for the chrome brand. The reason so many average PC users know about chrome is because of the market. They even hired Lady Gaga to do a Chrome ad, and I don't think they would go to the trouble of doing that if they were not interested in attracting users.<p>It is ok that Google want users for Chrome - nothing wrong with it. They have done so much to help users and the web with their investment in browser technology that there is no shame in marketing the product and wanting the world to use it.",1324792282

However, I want to ask you all to consider that it might be a good time to think about others who may be less fortunate than you. If you already have a favorite charity, please consider donating. If not, here are some that I personally consider decent:<p>- Doctors Without Borders (http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/) does great work in over 60 countries by helping those who are threatened by violence, neglect or catastrophe due to armed conflict, epidemics, malnutrition, natural disasters, exclusion from healthcare, etc. They have consistently high ratings from watchdog organizations and at least as of 2006 had over 86% of their donations go directly towards helping those in need [1].<p>- Donors Choose (http://www.donorschoose.org/) is an American online charity where public school teachers post classroom project requests and donors decide which project to sponsor. 100% of your donation goes directly to the beneficiary (unless you specifically give something to DC) [2]<p>- Vitanna (http://www.vittana.org/) is my personal favorite: less of a charity and more of a micro-loan marketplace, where you get to choose students to whom you make loans at no interest to help them complete their education. Once the student pays you back, you can either re-lend the money, give it to Vitanna to cover overhead or simply cash out. I see it as investing in global education and therefore global wealth. Once again, 100% of what you give benefits the students directly [3].<p>If there is another charity you think is worth sharing, please post it in the comments so others may partake.<p>Lastly, if you cannot afford to donate or simply do not wish to at this time, I'd like to make another request. On this day, please spend a few minutes thinking about some of the problems facing our world: hunger, epidemics, natural disasters, armed conflicts, poverty, etc. Hacker News is an amazing community with some of the world's most innovative and talented entrepreneurs and engineers. Even a few minutes of our collective time and attention could result in solutions to some of these problems. That is why I would like to challenge you to spend just a few minutes of your day on thinking about how we could make our world a better place.<p>[1] http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/donate/faq/#q2234<p>[2] http://www.donorschoose.org/help/user_agreement.html<p>[3] http://www.vittana.org/howitworks<p>Disclaimer: I am in no way affiliated with any organizations mentioned in this post.",1324791378

3390516,comment,3389286,3390402,3,0,gruseom,,,"Thank you, I enjoyed reading that very much. Actually, I enjoy reading all your Forth comments very much, so please write lots more. A few points that struck me:<p><i>getting rid of mode-switching words makes source code more compact</i><p>That's a big deal, given that source code size is the best measure of complexity we have and the best predictor of errors we have.<p><i>the GA144 uses essentially antique fab technology. With no changes to the design and the latest fabrication techniques you could (theoretically) get an order of magnitude more cores</i><p>A smart approach. Prove the thing useful first, with the knowledge that there's another order of magnitude waiting to be had.<p><i>programming them is very difficult and requires incredible attention to detail</i><p>Do we know any programs that have been written for them? What does Chuck write? Do they provide a foundation for building application-oriented languages in the classic Forth style?<p><i>I think that if any language other than Forth could be compiled for the machines it might be an array processing language like APL.</i><p>What I really want to know is whether this architecture would be suitable for dataflow, i.e. whether you could build a spreadsheet on top of it. It seems not unlike the systolic array architectures that were a hot research topic 25 years ago, and those were thought to be suitable for dataflow.<p>I work on the problem of data parallelism in spreadsheets, and the thought of being able to apply hardware like this to it makes me salivate. Okay, not just salivate, drool. But we're probably years away from being able to figure out how to do that. Capturing even the low-hanging data parallelism in spreadsheets with any generality has proven surprisingly difficult, and I don't have a good gut feeling for whether the software techniques we've developed to do it would translate naturally to the GA chips. If they could, it would be a dream come true, because we could first prove the software on traditional hardware and then ""go native"" later.<p>Obviously you couldn't just port already-written code to a platform that radically different. The question is whether the key concepts would survive or whether you'd have to rethink everything from scratch. The environment we're building is highly reactive. It doesn't just compile code and then run it; if the computations produce new formulae, those have to go back to the top level, get analyzed again, and then be computed in turn. That sort of re-entrancy turns out to be a big deal for spreadsheets, and most of the important constructs depend on it. I don't know if the GA chips would feel very good about that kind of dynamism; perhaps it would be more like ""Damn, you just got all the code laid out and now you're shoving us all around again.""",1324791192

Further suppose that the domestic real interest rate is 0 (this is approximately true and will make the math easier, but know this follows even if the interest rate is positive but smaller). As holder of Yen debt and cash, if I invest in a 10 year Yen CD I'd have 100 - 100 = 0 Yen after 10 years time. Alternatively, suppose I convert to dollars at $1 per 100 Yen, invest the $1 in a 10 year CD paying 10% every decade compounded every decade (interest rates are usually quoted in different units but again this will make the math easier). I will owe 100 Yen and I will have $1.10. I can lock in all these transactions today, and other than counter-party risk I <i>will</i> have $1.10 and 100 Yen. If I enter into a contract promising to trade dollars for Yen in the future (this would be a ""forward"" contract but that's just terminology) the agreed upon future exchange rate had better be $1.10 for 100 Yen for some hedge fundie is about to make free money. So the easy way to make your currency rise 65% is to pay no interest.<p>This seems like an impossible contradiction until you think though what you would have to do to capitalize on this, slash interest rates. So while this would lead to currency appreciation against other currencies in the long term, it would cause a drastic drop in the short term.<p>tl;dr; the easiest way to rapidly increase your elevation is to dig a hole with some stairs",1324789707

On the other hand, the time saved from not studying for some classes has resulted in me picking up a lot of knowledge that I wouldn't have otherwise<p>I think what matters most, if you haven't screwed up too bad (and it's hard to mess up that much, for most people on HN, I'd imagine), is that you step back, take a breath, and realize that you still have the potential.

Maybe I am assuming too much about the person I was replying to, but it sounds to me like he is defending Christianity as an equally defensible way to live your life, so I don't think invoking Hume here is actually supporting his argument.<p>It's worth clarifying that my claim is that I am trying to claim that faith is a subset of belief. That you can't possibly know anything for sure is incompatible with Christianity and all current major religions, and to act like making conclusions based on evidence with confidence levels is the same as saying you know Absolute Truth Just Because is clearly absurd.",1324789401

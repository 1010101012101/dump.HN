As such, sheer percentage of users is not as relevant as the accepted usage in an international or intercultural context.  We end up being in agreement over the outcome, but disagree on the standard for measurement.<p>Example of why percentage population doesn&#x27;t work: 14% of the world speaks Chinese natively by one estimate, the most of any language.

6834768,comment,6833353,6833353,21,0,tmoertel,,,"The original question asked about C++, but in the old days of assembly language, accessing &quot;out of scope&quot; data from the stack was fairly useful.<p>For example, Apple II computers had a series of slots into which expansion cards could be inserted to add new features to the computer.  These cards, as you might expect, often needed controller software, and this was supplied via on-card ROM.  The code in this ROM, by convention, was mapped into memory at address $Cx00, where x was the slot number the user happened to choose for the card.  As a result, when this code was called, it had no idea where it resided in memory and, consequently, which slot its card was in.  To figure these things out, the controller code used the following trick:<p><pre><code>    JSR IORTS\n    TSX\n    LDA $100,X\n</code></pre>\nThe JSR instruction makes a subroutine call, which causes the address of the next instruction to be pushed onto the system stack and then transfers control to the subroutine, in this case a well-known subroutine in system ROM called IORTS.  This routine, as its name implies, is just an RTS instruction, so it returns immediately back to its caller.  Control thus returns to the second instruction of our code, which copies the stack pointer into the X register. The third instruction then uses this pointer to read <i>above</i> the top of the system stack to obtain the value that was there during the call to IORTS.  This value, of course, was the most-significant byte of the return address pushed onto the stack by the JSR instruction. Now the code knows where it resides.<p>If you want to see a prime example of this technique in some famous code hand-assembled by Steve Wozniak 35 years ago, take a look at page 22 of the following PDF file.  It contains the boot code for the Apple Disk II controller card:<p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3data.computerhistory.org/atchm/documents/102723983-05-01-acc.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3data.computerhistory.org/atchm/do...</a>",1386003202

Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m bullish on a stock.  I&#x27;ll wait for a 5% or so pullback, then watch it on a down day.  I see a dip, I&#x27;ll buy in.  I could be up half a percent by day&#x27;s end.  Then, if I&#x27;m right, it&#x27;ll rally up to 10% within 2 weeks.<p>If I&#x27;m investing an &#x27;optimized&#x27; amount (ie. one that&#x27;s small enough to unload quickly, but big enough to make commissions a no-factor), then I can make money on a half-percent move.  I can be happy with 2%, and very happy with 5-10%.  If you repeat this enough, and have a batting average of 60% or higher (ie. consistently just over half with a very disciplined strategy), the interest compounds when you sell one stock to buy another.<p>Let&#x27;s add up numbers in 2 percent moves, times 10 trades.  You wind up at ~122 dollars, or 22% percent up from your original amount.  50 trades, you&#x27;re at 269 dollars.  Over double.  50 trades isn&#x27;t very much for a dedicated trader, and that&#x27;s not even what you&#x27;d call &#x27;day trading&#x27;.  Compounding interest and math is fun, eh?<p>>  Or do you possibly mean that you invest in 10 different stocks and one doubles?<p>That would be stupid.  Investing isn&#x27;t about shooting in the dark and hoping you hit something.  It&#x27;s about optimizing your return through solid principles, and not giving a shit about any single stock.<p>>  There is no basis for returns to &quot;go down as numbers go up&quot;, except if you are forgetting to average in the losses when the numbers were small.

However, suppose we went through the effort of computing posteriors, only to discover that we get stuck at the stage of computing pairwise probabilities. There is still a very good chance we can draw samples from the posteriors.<p>Even though our deterministic algorithm has failed, we still get a <i>much better random algorithm</i> out of the exercise.

There is no reason to actually clear the stack memory as that would be a waste of CPU cycles. Therefore, if main() calls foo(), then foo() returns, the contents of the variables of foo() is still one frame higher on the frame stack and given the right memory address you can still access it.<p>As others point out, this is not something you should rely on. On the other hand if you are trying to overflow the stack or somehow break the program, this is definitely something to try.<p>The converse of this is that local variables of main() can be made accessibly to foo():<p><pre><code>    void foo(int *x) {\n        printf(&quot;a = %d\\n&quot;, *x);\n    }\n\n    void main() {\n        int a = 12;\n        foo(&a);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis of course makes sense: when you are in the middle of foo(), main()&#x27;s variables have to be stored somewhere and are accessible.<p>Edit: here&#x27;s another fun way to get <i>a</i> from foo():<p><pre><code>    void foo() {\n        int *x;\n        x = (int *) (&x + sizeof(int));\n        printf(&quot;a = %d\\n&quot;, *x);\n    }\n\n    int main() {\n        int a = 12;\n        foo();\n        return 0;\n    }</code></pre>",1386002597

6834682,comment,6833691,6833691,3,0,6d0debc071,,,"> If you were to invent a language to be used in spreadsheets today, what would it look like?<p>Lisp. I&#x27;d have the cells contain data, and only data. You can type data into the cells like normal. However, when you want to input a formula I&#x27;d split the screen horizontally and have it start off with<p>(cell-name ( ____ ))<p>Have the user start typing in the middle of the second parenthesis where the underscore is by default - have it default selected to make it clear, slightly grey out the surrounding syntax so they don&#x27;t immediately have to worry about it but bring it back to the normal colour if they click outside of that.<p>Clicking a cell back on the cells windows would insert a reference to it.<p>(cell-name (+ a1))<p>Dragging across cells would define a group with some syntactic sugar.<p>(cell-name (+ group a1 b2))<p>Inserting a graph would show you the code of the graph right there in the code window.<p>What might I do differently to Lisp? I&#x27;d replace the + sign with &#x27;sum-of&#x27; and * with &#x27;product-of&#x27; to help people get used to the prefix style. So the above would become.<p>(cell-name (sum-of group a1 b2))<p>I&#x27;d have sum-of inserted when you clicked the + key on your keyboard to make it clearer how it worked.<p>I think this would be quite intuitive and add a lot of easily seen power. We&#x27;re used to using parenthesis to group math things, we&#x27;re used to using variables, we&#x27;re used to using functions - we just don&#x27;t tend to think of those things as such.<p>All your logic would be visible in the code window, finally escaping the horrible black-box style of clicking off the cell and everything vanishing.<p>Potential problems?<p>&#x27;Ah, but Excel&#x27;s for non-coders,&#x27; you might say. I don&#x27;t think it is, not really. If you just want to add a range together you have to learn a formula that&#x27;s quite similar to Lisp to begin with:<p>=SUM(a1:b2)<p>And in many ways it&#x27;s less intuitive than Lisp is. Why is =SUM required to be like that, why do you need to group the references after SUM like that? What is the : meant to signify? And as you go develop more complex things like SUM-IF you&#x27;re rapidly looking at something that&#x27;s just a bad programming language.<p>You can sort of muddle your way into it by messing around - but I don&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s not a thing that people have to learn or that it&#x27;s any easier than Lisp&#x27;s presentation would be. Have you tried interviewing for admin jobs lately? I have, I try interviewing for jobs I&#x27;m not interested in from time to time, and even working some of them, just to keep in contact with the state of offices. Pivot tables and &#x27;macros&#x27; are considered advanced excel knowledge - I&#x27;ve been in offices where most of the people working there don&#x27;t know how to make a drop-down list for a cell, or how to use something as simple as SUM-IF.<p>Excel&#x27;s language isn&#x27;t simple for non-coders already. Where it wins above programming languages that we all are perhaps more familiar with, IMO, is that it gives people an immediate visual hook into a data structure that they can use as a starting point.<p>Like the REPL - but with a slightly different emphasis.",1386002473

So in the mean time Amazon could negotiate pre-defined routes with the FAA that link the central warehouse to local depots. Drones would fly between this route and the route would be carefully chosen to mitigate disaster. The initial routes would also need to be chosen so that they have a natural advantage over the existing delivery network (say to and from an island or a mountainous location).

In such a situation, you can still get exactly the same money to change hands as an investment in a for-profit - by calling it debt. The non-profit could pay interest on the debt in the same way as dividends are paid, and so on. These work like non-voting/Preference shares.<p>I automatically convert &quot;real&quot; terminology into this framework in my head, as I don&#x27;t really believe groups of people (companies) can be valued philosophically.

When savings rates are good, there isn&#x27;t any need to risk your capital (let the bank do it for you). When rates are bad, you need to take on some of the risk yourself in order to get a good return. My analysis doesn&#x27;t change.<p>> <i>For a site that is so encouraging towards investing in businesses with good ideas, I don&#x27;t understand the aversion to doing the same through the stock market.</i><p>But you aren&#x27;t.

The level of clearance that is needed to handle cryptographic material is higher than the clearance to know about the information sent by the cryptographic system.  That&#x27;s because one piece of information, no matter how sensitive, is nowhere near as damaging as being able to read all encrypted material of your enemy.<p>Clearances aren&#x27;t just a title that you get - an increase in your security clearance goes hand in hand with your history coming under heavier scrutiny.  At first you might just get a cursory check to verify that you are who you say you are - teachers from your school may be contacted, neighbours etc.  As you start gaining access to cryptographic networks, the checks start going into who you associate with, what your hobbies are, what&#x27;s happening in your bank account.  And the checks get more discreet - you might learn about your primary school teacher getting asked questions about you, but you won&#x27;t learn that your telephone conversations were listened to for 6 months to make sure you&#x27;re not hanging out with $THREAT_DU_JOUR.<p>So if sigint is valuable, one of the best ways to get your hands on it is to compromise someone that has access - in other words humint.

I can only assume you were referring to my question &quot;how much do we know about whether a newborn has a compromised immune system or not?&quot;  That seems like a pretty legitimate question, does it not?  Do I need a medical degree to pose a question regarding how much medical history  we have about your average newborn baby?<p>Am I crossing some line into medical &#x27;research&#x27; by asking that question?  When babies are born, do they have clear documented medical histories that I&#x27;m unaware of?<p>You also asked if there were &quot;any vaccines given to newborns that are contraindicated for immune-compromised people&quot;.<p>First we need to define newborns.  Wikipedia says hours days or a few weeks old. I couldn&#x27;t find how the CDC defines newborns.<p>In the first couple days, the only scheduled vaccine per the CDC is usually Hep B. Whether others are given in the first couple days probably depends on doctors, the baby&#x27;s health, the parents, the country we&#x27;re in, etc.<p>From the CDC:\n&quot;Hepatitis B vaccination is contraindicated for persons with a history of hypersensitivity to yeast or to any vaccine component (92,189--191). Despite a theoretic risk for allergic reaction to vaccination in persons with allergy to Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker&#x27;s yeast), no evidence exists that documents adverse reactions after vaccination of persons with a history of yeast allergy.&quot;<p>So assuming you consider an allergy to be compromising to the immune system (which, by definition, an allergy is), it appears your answer is &quot;yes, there is a vaccine given (or at least recommended) to newborns that is contraindicated for certain immune-compromised people&quot;.<p>Hopefully those contraindicated infants are not given that vaccine, but as I posed earlier, how much do we know about an individual infant&#x27;s immune system within hours of birth?  This probably depends on a lot of things as well - doctors, hospital (or home birth), availability of testing and results, etc.<p>The RV vaccine is usually given in the first couple months, where the &#x27;newborn&#x27; label could still apply depending on how you use the word.  RV is contraindicated for SCID.<p>Below is a full list of contraindications for several vaccines, listed on the CDC website.<p><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/VACCINES/recs/vac-admin/contraindications-vacc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cdc.gov/VACCINES/recs/vac-admin/contraindications...</a>",1386000897

Two potential cases are those of code-breaking in wartime, where the number of messages an enemy needs to send is so large that their validity can be checked fairly easily, and that of a secret weapon, where the information produced by spies can be checked by actually making the weapon.&quot;<p>> Both GCHQ and NSA can point to successes as can all the major players in the spy game would Stalin have got the bomb so quickly without spies.<p>To the contrary, he specifically addressed Stalin&#x27;s bomb: &quot;On the face of it, the reaction to the atom spies seemed justified. The atom bomb was a weapon that could destroy the world (and perhaps still will) and the science on which it was based was popularly associated with the genius of Albert Einstein. Surely, the only way the Russians could create such a weapon was to steal the secrets of the West....But once the existence of the bomb was known, any competent team of physicists, with access to the right resources, could duplicate it...The secrets passed by Western spies probably saved them a year or so in their research program but did not fundamentally change anything.

In most cases, espionage agencies can cloak their failures in secrecy, but the defeat of the Nazis paved the way for a look at the record of one of the most-feared espionage networks in history. The Hitler regime made numerous attempts to infiltrate spies into Britain and to recruit British agents. As far as can be determined from the German records, all were captured and many were ‘turned’, being induced or forced to transmit disinformation to Berlin.&quot;<p>> And do you think binladen would not have been found and killed if it wasn&#x27;t for spies run by CIA officers?<p>Sigint, again.

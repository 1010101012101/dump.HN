As Seth Godin often points out ""Being safe is risky"".<p>If you wish to make a pre-launch buzz, try it in a controlled environment. A strategy I used was to aim for foreign startup blogs (mandarin, spanish, french, etc) instead of western ones. Their reviews gave me a leg up on the feedback I should anticipate from western bloggers. <p>Since the initial buzz I generated centered around foreign bloggers, I did not risk losing my reputation in front of the big name Web 2.0 startup bloggers. I took my startup to the west only after I was satisified with the feedback.",1173605992
3555,comment,3492,3503,0,0,lucas,,,"I was giving the initial email idea as an example. I think it's an interesting way to launch a social networking site. It gives you an early way to measure the appeal of the site and the effectiveness of one of the social networking aspects.<p>I don't think I would bother with a press release, unless you're launching something huge and you have the capital to back it up (e.g., a scalable system and people ready to go). I was just putting that out there. It sort of goes against the web model, anyway.<p>Having people give email addresses is one approach, but that realy only serves to give you a way to make a targeted announcement. Good, but not great. Having the site up and running is the crucial step. By the 80-20 rule, the last 20% of the features takes 80% of the time. Getting a product out the door is hard. <p>Once it's up, people will judge it pretty quickly, I think. They will look at it, judge it cool and come back, or judge it harshly and never come back again. Sometimes you get a second chance. If the product can be rapidly improved and you can maintain some buzz, then those lost users may see a reference to it and give it another try.\n",1173605642

There tend to be or should be limits, e.g. back in the '90s it really didn't tend to work to hire a non-OO programmer to work on an OO language project, because they had to learn a new paradigm as well as the more minor details of a new language (which if we're talking C to C++ isn't that big to begin with), unless you were willing to wait something more than a month for them to be productive.<p>It would be interesting to look at the hiring of companies that do functional programming.  A new employee how didn't at least take SICP or one of its functional derivatives would take a while to learn the new paradigm.<p>And there are many tech companies that simply can't do anything other than train new employees because they're just not going to find anyone who's up on their technology.  Before the mainframe alternatives to IBM all but died and UNIX took over the midrange companies doing anything other than IBM mainframe work generally would have to train their new employees, e.g. Honeywell didn't expect new Multicians to be productive until at least a month had passed.<p>Today's greater standardization allows what you're talking about ... which many people think is also commonly a sign of poor management, specifically the manager who doesn't believe he has the ability to mentor those under him or even be able to judge their progress in coming up to speed.  Heck, how many companies even ask prospects to <i>prove</i> they can program (e.g. FizzBuzz), let alone program in the language/framework in question?<p>In general the state of the art in US IT industry management is <i>dreadful</i> and you can't particularly afford that in a field that's so difficult and unforgiving (""Can't fool Mother Nature"" sort of unforgiving).",1282334249

1621396,comment,1621190,1621190,0,0,OmarIsmail,,,"Overall I really like the idea, for anybody that's done serious SEO, it's very nice to have this kind of service. My major issue is that the pricing system makes me extremely nervous. We're one of those sites that has a ""gazillion"" keywords and when I see the price jumping from $50-$1000/month with just an increase of a few thousand keywords it makes me think that a few hundred thousand keywords will cost substantially more than my entire monthly revenue.<p>I think you created the pricing schedule based on your costs. The more keywords being tracked the more ""crawlers"" necessary, meaning the more servers you need and thus more cost. However, I think you need to establish a pricing schedule based on the customer's math. i.e. something that's directly related to revenue (most likely traffic, or maybe number of pages) so that the ROI calculation is easier.<p>Right now maybe I have a few hundred thousand keywords, is that going to cost me $100K/month? Even though 95% of them generate a small amount of traffic? So now I'm doing a blind ROI calculation. Essentially I have to use your system (and pay for it) before I know how much I'm going to be spending.<p>If you make your pricing based on something I know (# pages, monthly uniques, pageviews, etc) I have an actual idea on how much I'm going to be paying and I can make an intelligent decision accordingly.<p>I guess I could use the ""personal"" free service to see just how many keywords your system will find and be able to do a better calculation, but that seems a little obtuse.<p>So I think the goal is to come up with a pricing structure that is easier to calculate, and on your end not have people crush your system with too many keywords. This can be done pretty easily I think: bucket keywords in priority (refreshed daily, once a week, once a month, etc).<p>Priority is based off of a few factors: traffic and historical volatility.<p>In this way you can intelligently and efficiently monitor hundreds of thousands, even millions of keywords with 1 cheap server (maybe $100/month) and charge out 500-1000/month. In that way you're still seeing fantastic margins, I'm getting great use out of the system, and everybody's happy.",1282334162

1621384,comment,1620312,1621053,0,0,10ren,,,"I think there's an argument that DNA is more likely to lead to life (not intelligence) than an arbitrary coding scheme; that is, that with DNA it's easier to create life than you'd expect for a vanilla encoding scheme.<p>This assumes that during the billions of years on earth before DNA, lots of different chemicals came together, but if any self-replicating one came together, it would grow and still be around. Exceptions are if it wasn't very good at it and died out, or that DNA-based life attacked it or grew faster, crowding it and starving it (or bad luck wiped it out - but it could arise again.)<p>The fact that DNA did survive shows that DNA is indeed <i>specially</i> suited to encoding life. One might even try to estimate how specialized it is, by estimating how improbably it is, based on how long it took for a planet of experiments to arrive at it.<p>The details of how it's special could be in terms of protein folding, eg. that you can specify some really cool and useful folds, crucial for life, in surprisingly short DNA sequences. It's as if the search space of encoding schemes was scoured for schemes that in effect included a handy collection of library functions.<p>But this lovely (I think) argument doesn't apply to intelligence at all; nor even to mammals, or indeed animals - just for basic life.

1621368,comment,1619493,1621164,0,0,kragen,,,"> While the predictions of scarcity are likely correct, the predictions of the consequences of scarcity likely aren't. For example: Once the cost of helium increases, substitutes will be found for many applications. For a buoyant gas, people might use hot air, or hydrogen mixed with some kind of flame retardant. Low temperature research might rely more on computer simulations. MRIs and other devices might use high temperature superconductors bathed in liquid nitrogen.<p>Those are cool speculations.<p>Hydrogen is probably the only option for a buoyant gas.  I don't think mixing flame retardants in with hydrogen will work; you either need something lighter than nitrogen (and hydrogen, helium, and neon are the only candidates) or something that can retard flame appreciably in such small quantities that it doesn't counteract the buoyancy, and I don't think any such substances exist.  They'd either have to produce a lot of non-inflammable gas, the way sodium bicarbonate does, or absorb a lot of heat like tetraethyl lead, and in either case they have to be pretty heavy.<p>For superconductor and other cryogenic coolants, as they said, liquid helium is already recycled.<p>I like the idea of using high-temperature superconductors. Maybe invest in yttrium mines?  (I guess there are lots of high-temperature superconductors today.)  Why don't these devices currently use high-temperature superconductors?  Are they too expensive?

Now you must write your emulator, encode GENOME for your emulator, and run it on B. We know you can do that since these are both Turing class machines. What we do not know is how many bits it will take to encode GENOME. It could be 50 Megabytes. Or it could be 50 Terabytes. You just can't tell without proving things about the specific details of machines A and B and your emulator.</i><p>If your emulator requires substantially different space to encode the raw description of the program than the original, then the emulator sucks.  So if GENOME takes 50 MB to encode in one place, it should take 50 MB to encode in another.  Certainly in any emulator written for real computers, it wouldn't take more than that.<p>But we're lacking the emulator.  That's important because nobody knows how big or little that will be.  The point that the biologist made boils down to saying that the emulator is an incredibly complex thing that has to encode an environment whose complexity is much, much more than that of the genome.  So one flaw in that line of reasoning from Kurzweil is that we have no known upper limit on the size of the emulator itself.  The biologist's argument basically comes down to, ""The emulator itself needs to be much, much bigger than GENOME, and we have no idea how to write it.""<p>(Note that I'm not arguing that Kurzweil is correct, but merely that your arguments against him were not correct.)<p><i>Yes. You are correctly observing that Omega is not really a constant - it is a class of constants. For machine A there is Omega_A. For machine B, Omega_B. That is why Chaitin lectures about Omega but only after several reminders that it's really ""Omega_X for some specific machine X -- but I'm mostly just going to say Omega and let X be understood.""\nSo, now, think that through with Kurzweil goggles on. In Kurzweil's world, a program of 50MB on one machine can't be 50TB on the next machine -- that's just silly, right? Well, if he were correct then, in general, Omega_A and Omega_B, for any machines A and B, would have to be somewhat close in value. We know that Omega_A and Omega_B don't have to be close (other than that they both come from the same (0,1) interval). By contradiction we conclude that we don't live in the world Kurzweil is describing.</i><p>Not so fast.  As I pointed out, even if the emulator was just a ridiculously small 50 bytes, then Omega_A would tell us very little about Omega_B because only about 1 program in 10<i></i>120 on machine B would be programs that are emulated from machine A.  You know nothing about the halting probability of the rest, and so Omega_A says very little about Omega_B.<p>(Obviously that 50 bytes is ridiculously small.  But in <a href=""http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~chaitin/lisp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~chaitin/lisp.html</a> Chaitin has an interesting example of a Lisp variant that can run a theorem prover against itself with only 410 bytes of overhead.  So with pairs of machines, you can get away with surprisingly little.)",1282333481

Its because the majority of the variation in preferences occurs in a minority of the market.  In other words, there's a small population of people like me, who have widely varying preferences and a large population of people whose preferences are similar enough to be served by a device with limited features.  From Apple's perspective, people like me aren't worth the expense - its much more profitable to drop the features used by the minority in order to hone and polish the features used by the majority.<p>Sure, Apple will never have me as a customer.  From their perspective, that's an acceptable trade-off, since the effort required in building features to attract me isn't worth the opportunity cost.",1282333437

In that vein, what bothers me about Kurzweil is that he seems to be just taking some assumptions and running with them.<p>Specifically, i believe that he assumes that intelligence and computation are the same thing. At least, he asserts that both are equimaterial --- that a sufficient powerful calculating machine is bound to be able to generate intelligence.<p>I do not know if intelligence == computation.<p>I do accept that, in many domains, the two things are interchangeable. Like, for example, if you are interviewing for a programming job and you can't do division in your head, that is a bad sign.<p>But if we are looking to <i>build</i> intelligence <i>from</i> computation, then i think we will bump into any differences that exist.<p>If computation and intelligence are equal or at least similar, that would be an interesting fact. It would teach us a lot about ourselves. To my taste it is a very interesting line of questioning. But it is not proven.<p>Really, we can't even really define intelligence! (As a sidenote, i think that is exactly the point of the ""Turing Test"", not to prove AI, but to show that intelligence is not clearly defined.)<p>If intelligence is a kind of computation, then Moore's Law means AI, definitely. And in that case, Kurzweil estimate of 2 decades is as good as any. If intelligence != computation, then some completely unrelated discovery has to intervene.<p>There is one thing that makes me doubt the assumption of equality, though. Namely, computers are already extremely better at computation than we are. I am 30yo and i can't recall a time when i didn't have available calculators way more powerful and fast than myself. If the translation from computation to intelligence was straightforward, my feeling is that the exponential nature of Moore's should have already made AI a reality before i went out of college.",1282333349

You actually pose some interesting questions, and hopefully I can offer useful answers for people who might come across this thread.<p>First off, we're not a ""SF startup""; we're a distributed team. My co-founders are in Brooklyn. I'm in Portland, along with two other employees. Our engineers are in SF, but quite frankly, they could decide to move to Siberia tomorrow and that'd be just fine.<p>If you read the blog that my co-founders have been contributing to over the last year, you'll find that they're very much ""in love with the customer"", and eager to explain how traditional banks have been doing those customers wrong. As was previously noted here on HN, they've been personally emailing anyone and everyone who signs up for more information about our service. The initial product we're launching is based on direct feedback resulting from thousands of those conversations with potential customers. We take their feedback very seriously.<p>Now, question-by-question:<p>1. Our Lead Engineer is not exclusively a Lisp programmer. He's worked in a variety of languages, including Common Lisp, Erlang, Ruby, and most recently, C#. I'm a big fan of ""polyglot programming"", and to me, Dave's ability to work in a variety of languages is, to my mind, an asset and a testament to his skill as a programmer.<p>2. Yes, we have a Creative Director. Our business involves much more than just a web presence, and we need much more than the average web designer. Banking is a complex economic and social interaction in which design plays a key role at every step. We chose someone not just with web, print, and identity work in his portfolio, but someone with deep industrial design experience. Bill earns the title of Creative Director through years of hard work, service to his industry peers, and a commitment to approaching the problem of designing a better banking experience holistically.<p>3. We're staffing up fairly conservatively when you consider our mission. This isn't just another build-it-in-a-weekend consumer web business. We're a fraction of the size of the web teams and/or IT teams at most banks.<p>4. Yes, we're hiring people who've worked effectively together. You'll find many posts from VCs and entrepreneurs about the value of ""putting the band back together"". I'm thrilled to have a team who are already in sync with one another.<p>5. Yes, Dave has worked in Erlang, and we're considering using technologies like Riak that are developed in Erlang. And yes, we plan to work in Scala and Clojure. I'm not sure why this is a question. They're great technologies. They work well. Lots of people are using them, including people in the financial services world who have run into the limitations of legacy technologies. Interesting technologies keep developers happy, motivated, and learning.<p>6. Yes, we're a distributed team. This should be nothing new in the tech world, particularly in the startup community. Being distributed allows us to work with talented people wherever they may be, keeps our costs down, and forces us to communicate clearly and explicitly amongst one another. It also lets us focus, and avoids the burdens and time-wasters of office water cooler culture.<p>I don't think you've taken the time to read about our backgrounds. If you had, you'd know that our CFO has spent years in the banking industry; that our CEO has helped managed a multi-billion dollar hedge fund and run an online marketplace for mortgages; that our Creative Director is an industry leader in UX and has focused specifically on issues of humane product and service design. I'm comfortable saying that our team has equal expertise in banking, ""people"", and technology.<p>Of course, part of our company's thesis is that a bank run like a tech startup will do better by its customers than a traditional bank or credit union. It seems like you disagree on that point, which is puzzling for this forum, given that so much of the Hacker News ethos is about making the world a better place through technically-minded entrepreneurship. So yes, we have a startup mentality, and people on our team are passionate about technology as well as about our product and customers. I see no need to apologize for that.<p>We do understand that the people are going to be hesitant to trust a new financial institution, as well they should be. The burden is on us to bridge that trust gap and, frankly, to prove people like you wrong.

1621294,comment,1620312,1620312,0,0,10ren,,,"I'm writing this to try to clarify my understanding. I think this is the essence of Kurzeil's argument on estimating complexity:<p>Let's take the genome (DNA) as a program + data, and the phenome (the organism) as an output (and assume the mother is in adequate health, and development proceeds normally.) Then the number of different possible phenomes is limited to the number of different genomes (it could be fewer, if there are non-significant regions of the genome, because then more than one genomes could produce the same phenome. That is, the function G->P is not necessarily injective.)<p>While this doesn't directly describe the complexity of a phenome, the argument is that the complexity of a thing is no greater than the means of defining it, and that any additional complexity in the resulting thing must contain redundancies (perhaps very hidden) that can be eliminated. A simple case is a program to print hello 1000 times. The program is short, and though the output is long, it contains redundancies. What about from chaotic systems and fractals, or 'normal' numbers like pi, where great complexity arises from simple rules? The argument is that this is merely apparent complexity, and in reality contains great redundancy. Big output changes from small input changes doesn't disprove this; consider changing 1000 to 2000 in the above. While a particular sequence of pi digits, or a particular fractal frame, might seem complex, there is also the input to consider of the specification of that part (eg which digits) also takes information.<p>---<p>Here's the theoretical flaw: considering a genome as a program, what if the entire program isn't really listed in the genome, but it calls library functions? Obviously, it becomes much shorter, but we're not measuring the library code, so it's cheating. Or, what if the program is written in a highlevel language rather than a lowlevel one (like assembly) - this is equivalent, if you consider the syntax of the language as causing in function calls. Clearly, we still have the same mapping of program->results, and the number of different results is still limited, but those results are much more complex than the program; they programs don't represent the complexity of the output.<p>How does this apply to the development of a phenome from a genome? Does anything add information, like standard libraries? One might say that the mother is like a standard library - but little information seems to be input in this way (consider development of a chicken egg); and fundamentally, the mother is also a phenome that can be specified by the very genome in question: it's self-hosting.<p>Does protein folding add information? It is very complex, but is that just how it operates (the way that the implementation runs), or does it also add information to the output? Remarks on this seem to say only that it's complex and unknown and therefore hard to simulate. I'm talking about whether the complexity of action adds information to the output. If so, how much complexity? Is it significant, comparable to a standard library, or is it more like a trivial macro?<p>I don't know how much <i>information is added to the phenome</i> by protein folding; this is a question for the biologists. I think addressing it squaring in these terms would defuse much of the emotion in the discussion. But I'll guess:<p>If we assume protein folding is dictated by quite a long sequence (ie. it's not a context of one, like G->down, U->up, A->left, C->right, but a function of say 100s of bases -- and of course the fold direction is not always 90 degrees), then there is scope for an (almost) arbitrarily complex function, from sequence->fold. The complexity is limited by the input (number of bases involved) and output (the actual fold).<p>If we then assume that the shape of the protein is the crucial thing for its interaction with raw materials and other proteins (eg. as an enzyme), then complexity of protein folding does directly translate into complexity of results - even at this, the finest-grain level of operation.<p>Although protein folding potentially adds complexity, I find it hard to imagine that it would add information comparable to a standard library, such as, say 50 bases specifying an eye or a liver (which a standard library might do, like Python's SimpleHttpServer). That would be miraculous, if the laws of physics were so favourable to the particular needs of organisms (like a programming language that is customized to a particular application, as modern libraries contain code for TCP/IP and HTTP.) I find it easy to believe that it's more like the variation in syntax between (say) lisp, java and assembly.<p>So, I don't think protein folding adds much complexity to the result; it's more like a <i>general</i> purpose programming language than a set of <i>specialized</i> library functions (I think this question is the crucial issue in the debate.)<p>---<p>To conclude, I think the complexity of the genome <i>does</i> estimate the complexity of the phenome: I agree with Kurzeil that the brain is (roughly) as complex as the sections of the genome necessary for its development.",1282332056

HTC Sense is absolutely awful compared to AOSP, and it's nice to know that I'm not the only one that thinks so.  It's amazing how random tweaks to the software can make it so unusable.<p>(Also, the default build on my EVO ate battery like crazy, the number one complaint by reviewers.  Install CM, the battery lasts all day, even with heavy Kindle and Browser use.)<p>It's a shame that ""normal users"" don't get to decide whether or not they want Sense.",1282331289

He praises fresh food and praises eating seasonally for its flavor and other benefits.  What he objects to is eating locally in a dogmatic way and he objects to trying to use transportation costs as a justification for that.  He largely debunks the transportation cost argument and says that forcing crops to grow in inappropriate places (like tomatoes in the Hudson Valley) is worse than shipping them.<p><i>one thing that I think is hard to argue is that America needs more and better home cooks.</i><p>I would argue that, at least in dense urban areas.  There are enormous economies of scale in storing and preparing more food communally.  If you look at a college dorm or military barracks, they generally do not have the facilities to store or cook food (I'm excluding pure microwave cooking) in each room, but instead have some form of caffeteria.  Thus, they save a huge amount of space in the rooms by not having a kitchen, energy since the refrigeration is done in large, effecient units and so is the cooking, and time for the people living there.  I think there would be a cultural resistance to moving this model into a lot of apartment buildings, but there would be a lot of advantages to doing so.",1282331260

1621243,comment,1620312,1621125,0,0,dasht,,,"ewjordan: That's beautiful.   Let me sort it out slightly and offer a counter argument or at least response to part.<p>So, we agree that Kurzweil's ""information theory"" snobbery is wrong.  His real argument is ""C'mon... look, the genome's small.  Under a microscope the brain looks like it has many parts but very regularly arranged.   How hard can it be?  Trillions of lines?  Please!""<p>That's not an information theory argument.  That's a vague, hand-wave argument to an underspecified but compelling-sounding conclusion.   ""Reverse engineer the brain.""  ""Build something similar.""  WTF could possibly happen that would prove him wrong?   How exactly could Kurzweil's ""predictions"" here be falsified?<p>Put another way, if he changed his rebuttal to Meyers to be ""I made no substantive argument or claim.  Myers responded as if I had.  Therefore Myers has erred.""  -- I could accept that.  It then does raise the question of why Kurzweil was not more explicit about making no substantive argument or claim but that's a separate matter.   It's moot because Kurzweil isn't making that rebuttal.<p>To your statistical argument, which is quite interesting...<p>I think the meat of your case is here:<p><i>So I ask you this: do you know a fact about ""zygote machines"" that makes them much better suited to constructing intelligence algorithms than most other machines?</i><p>Rather than quibble over what ""intelligence algorithms"" mean I am going to pretend you said ""human brains or things very similar to such"".<p>The answer is ""Yes, I know quite a few facts that strongly support the hypothesis that human zygotes are, among the machine-like entities in the world, uniquely well suited to building human brains -- and very difficult to replace by any substantially different kind of machine.""<p>At this point I would basically just repeat Myers' argument, perhaps adding in more specific but randomly selected details.<p>If you want to rescue Kurzweil by leaving the abstract ""information theory"" b.s. he offered and looking at the specifics -- then we've gone full circle.  Kurzweil doesn't understand the brain.<p>Now there is an exception to all this.  A different way of looking at it.   I think that if you scrape off layers of hype and clouds of obfuscation, Kurzweil will consider himself to be proved correct if, in say 20 years, -- and just for example:<p>You can buy a box that has at least stereo video inputs and that, using an artificial neural net, does exquisitely accurate facial recognition.   Or that can look at visualization of architectural CAD drawings -- millions of variations per hour -- and select a few with a high percentage chance of being pleasing to most people.   Or that, in combination with the tactile-feedback neural net, can manipulate agonizingly capable microscopic tools for very delicate surgeries or for building nanotech or ...<p>I think it's f'ing obvious that (unless civilization fails - not out of the question) we have all that in 20 years and maybe sooner.   I think that was f'ing obvious about 30 years ago, and to some, pretty clear even before that.<p>I don't think those devices count, in any reasonable way, as ""reverse engineering the brain"" but I guess they count as ""reverse engineering a few select aspects of useful computational tricks that brains do in real time, quite efficiently"".<p>I don't think those inevitable advances offer much support to Kurzweil's ""exponential"" technology - they are straight up incremental, boringly predictable advances.   I don't think they're a real challenge to ordinary human predictive powers:  we've seen this stuff coming for decades.  Don't even get me started on how ""the singularity"" is dangerous, meaningless, new-age clap-trap.<p>But, Kurzweil  dresses up such banal observations to make it sound like, any day now, massive machine mega-brains will take over the world.  Hopefully they'll love us and kindly upload our consciousness and.....<p>So it is, to repeat my original point, with some delight that I take on Kurzweil's ""information theory"" sniping at Meyers.",1282330927

Not the same as supporting CUDA, which is owned by nVidia only. Unless nVidia open-sources CUDA, AMD cannot do anything for it.<p>The article said the same thing:<p>> Through HIP AMD will bridge the gap between HCC and CUDA by giving developers a CUDA-like syntax – the various HIP API commands – allowing developers to program for AMD GPUs in a CUDA-like fashion. Meanwhile HIP will also including a toolset (the HIPify Tools) that further simplifies porting by automatically converting CUDA code to HIP code. And finally, once code is HIP – be it natively written that way or converted – it can then be compiled to either NVIDIA or AMD GPUs through NVCC (using a HIP header file to add HIP support) or HCC respectively.<p>> To be clear here, HIP is not a means for AMD GPUs to run compiled CUDA programs. CUDA is and remains an NVIDIA technology. But HIP is the means for source-to-source translation, so that developers will have a far easier time targeting AMD GPUs.<p>What&#x27;s even worse is that it may not be legal either:<p>> Now there are some unknowns here, including whether AMD can keep HIP up to date with CUDA feature additions, but more importantly there’s a question of just what NVIDIA’s reaction will be. CUDA is NVIDIA’s, through and through, and it does make one wonder whether NVIDIA would try to sue AMD for implementing the CUDA API without NVIDIA’s permission, particularly in light of the latest developments in the Oracle vs. Google case on the Java API. AMD for their part has had their legal team look at the issue extensively and doesn’t believe they’re at risk – pointing in part to Google’s own efforts to bring CUDA support to LLVM with GPUCC – though I suspect AMD’s efforts are a bit more inflammatory given the direct competition. Ultimately it’s a matter that will be handled by AMD and NVIDIA only if it comes to it, but it’s something that does need to be pointed out.<p>Why the heck would any developers use HIP with this legal issue up in the air?",1447693065

If on any day, one party cannot settle up on their daily variation margin, the trade is terminated.<p>Compare this to before, when swaps were often un-collateralized, so you might have a huge paper profit on a trade that you&#x27;ll never actually realize because the counterparty lacks the cash to settle up.<p>So before, you could lose the total amount of your trade, but now you can only lose a day&#x27;s worth of gain or loss.<p>This is a big improvement, and the risk to the taxpayer is pretty de minimus.  Of course the central clearinghouse could default, but that&#x27;s very unlikely for a variety of reasons (mostly that the central clearinghouse&#x27;s whole reason for existence is not to default).",1447692999

The only reason volunteers in an industry can be unpaid is because the supply of people willing to work for no money outstrips the demand.  If there were not enough people to volunteer in an area, the organization could and would pay some amount out of their operating fund to pay the work, if it was important to them.

Kazoo has been the focus for the past 4 years, bluebox is now a community project if I recall correctly.<p>Kazoo is a multi-tenant hosted pbx and trunking solution. It is an erlang cluster which uses amqp as a messaging bus and erlang apps which provide centralized call control and features across multiple freeswitch (media server) and kamailio servers (sip proxy). A shared cluster wide database is provided by bigcouch.<p>The difference between this and a cluster of asterisks (or broadcloud, kandy etc) is that you as a user or account, are not tied to a single server, any phone on your cluster can utilize the resources of the entire cluster as the erlang apps and AMQP bus provide a glue joining all servers in the cluster into a single &quot;switch&quot;. Most of the &quot;cloud&quot; telephony out there is not distributed, it is mostly a lot of boxes with at best HA fail-over to another box that sits in as a warm standby with a unified provisioning layer to hide this from the users.<p>You can checkout kazoo at github <a href=""http://github.com/2600hz/kazoo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/2600hz/kazoo</a><p>There is a kazoo all in one ISO, which lets you run all the services in a cluster via a single server.

And even if they do, they&#x27;ve made a large amount of one meal and get burnt out eating the same thing for three days. To have variety seems to take cooking full meals every night, which is a lot of work.<p>You have to think like an industrial kitchen. A restaurant doesn&#x27;t cook every meal for every customer 100% from scratch as they are needed. Not even the highest of the high end restaurants do that. But they also don&#x27;t have vats of fully prepared food sitting around to get gross and dish out at the last minute.<p>You are similarly one person having to cook for 21 people every week: you, 3 times a day, 7 days a week. The ways you would make that work for cooking for 21 people in one meal are the ways you make it work for cooking for one person over 21 meals.<p>The key is to break a set of common recipes down into key, bottleneck components that keep well. You cook them 80% of the way in bulk, then cook them the last 20% when you need them.<p>You can also combine some of your prep-time per meal into your prep-time for the week. It takes no more time to cook 6 chicken breasts in the oven as it takes to cook 1, but if you want chicken breast for dinner tonight, you might as well cook 5 more. Then the next day you can slice it thin to have on a sandwich for lunch, dice it up and mix with spices for tacos, mix with mayo for chicken salad, put on top of salads, etc.<p>If I&#x27;m chopping onions, I often only want half the onion, but I will chop the whole onion and stow the half I don&#x27;t need because I&#x27;ll probably need half a chopped onion the next day, too. Rice takes about 15 minutes to make, regardless if it&#x27;s 1/2 cup or 2 cups. I can only eat 1/2 cup in a meal, so I make 2 cups and stow the other three servings.<p>When I make tacos, I usually make a LOT of ground beef with taco seasoning. Don&#x27;t buy the packets. Taco seasoning is just spicy cornflour gravy. You make a spicy, erh, soup with whatever ingredients you like and then thicken it with cornflour. Now you&#x27;re never out of taco seasoning. And taco meat goes great with eggs in the morning.<p>The next time you&#x27;re at a restaurant, pay attention to the side dishes and see how many of them are either the same or are different variations of similar components. There is huge variety from few inputs in permutation.",1447692508

For example if I want to fade in a GUI element on a page, I don&#x27;t want to create a new element for every transition change. Theres nothing wrong with mutable state, but it is nice to have immutability for some use cases. In this case c# has valuetypes, and the const/readonly modifiers.<p>Mutability is one side effect. OCaml is not Haskell and doesn&#x27;t have a type system baked in. Sure, sometimes you need to cheat, but mutability as the general rule is crazyland. Immutability gives you a compile-time assurance that your data structures are consistent and valid, as long as the tests in your constructor function are correct.<p>> Yep C# has had this since the beginning. And you can even use &#x27;dynamic&#x27; if you really want which moves all type checking to runtime.<p>Well, it has strong static type checking... within the bounds of what its type system supports. Which is fairly limited.<p>> I feel like these are more buzz words than actual substance.<p>Others have responded to that, but in short, your impression is wrong.<p>> Again C# has these abilities with &#x27;var a = 0&#x27; for example. It won&#x27;t infer method return types, not because it couldn&#x27;t, but because it&#x27;s just generally clearer to have the explicit return type written there in the code for the reader.<p>C#&#x27;s &quot;type inference&quot; is cute, but you can&#x27;t seriously compare it with OCaml&#x27;s.",1447692318

To name a few. I was using Eiffel in a small side project just about when Java released their 1.1.4 (a version before the object serialization library, iirc). It was a sticking point for me. Add to that, to program in java before IBM Visual Age was released was to using vi/notepad(++?) editors. Coming from Smalltalk env that was a bit of a shock. Eiffel commercial IDE from ISE was way better and its clever use of pick event on the mouse&#x27;s right click to drop to compile/run targets was actually easier on my fingers, which is a side show, but good quality products demonstrate quality at unexpected places.<p>I am still programming in java in my day job, knowing fully well that Java was not my top five language choices. Eiffel&#x27;s type system was a bit more advanced than Java even way back in those days, so not only was I stuck without an ide till VA for Java showed up or VisuallJ++ I also had to accept weak inheritance and design by contract models. Performance of course was not even close to an Eiffel compiled C code, which was probably addressed in later versions of java.<p>My point being, that just as Eiffel was something that was better and set aside by a few leading development shops, there must have been other languages that could/should have received a fair share in language evaluation by programmers, I dont necessarily mean limiting to Ruby, Python for example, despite them being excellent tools, they may fall short in an enterprise ecosystem. What happened at least I seem to think instead is a sort of groupthink to start coding in Java because of rubbernecking. All in all, I think that things could have been better if people paused to understand the Java language model and fixed in java 1.2/3, or some earlier version so we didnt have to wait till Java 1.8 to get these features.\n/rant.",1447692250

Some weeks ago I read an article about a woman in the US who accused a co-worker of sexual harassment stating that he said he would like to go out with her after work.<p>Maybe in the world I live things are different, but since when is finding someone attractive and asking out considered sexual harassment?<p>I just don&#x27;t get it. How do people in the US even get remotely close to each other, find a significant other, etc? Aren&#x27;t people afraid to even suggest a date?",1447692145

The amplitude of the resultant signal varies sinusoidally, as the instantaneous phase difference between the two signals goes from 0->2pi. One way of describing the signal would be that it is a separate tone (sitting in the middle of the two frequencies) being amplitude modulated by a signal at the beat frequency... which is what you hear and why you &quot;hear&quot; the beat frequency) I went with this way of describing the signal because you were talking about &quot;an arbitrarily high frequency signal getting louder and softer 440 times per second&quot; which is the definition of amplitude modulation.<p>Counterintuitively, there is no frequency component generated at the beat frequency when you sum a 1kHz and 1.001kHz signal, its easy to test that out with matlab, octave, scipy/numpy/matplotlib, etc. Generate the two signals, add them together, and look at the Fourier transform, you&#x27;ll see two components, one at 1kHz and one at 1.001kHz (assuming you take a long enough window to have that type of resolution) and no component at the beat frequency. A third sinewave doesn&#x27;t just jump out of nowhere when you add two separate sinewaves together.<p>If you take the sum of those two signals and run them through an ideal brickwall highpass filter at 999Hz so there are no frequency components below 999Hz, you&#x27;ll still &quot;hear&quot; the beat frequency because it isn&#x27;t a separate spectral component, its just the two signals slowly going out of phase, cancelling eachother out, and then going back in phase and boosting the amplitude.",1447691749

So Zelda is more complex than Mario (unless P=PSPACE). Is there some subjective way in which Zelda is harder than Mario, that would correspond to the difference? I guess Zelda can feel more cerebral, maybe.<p>More crucially the proofs in this paper rely just on the availability of certain items and level configurations that allow them to build circuits to solve 3SAT or whatever. All the other items and possible configurations in a game are irrelevant. For example they show Zelda OoT is PSPACE-complete because it has puzzles where you push around ice blocks---it is possible to construct such as puzzle where solving the puzzle is PSPACE-complete. All the other puzzles in the game, and also the configuration of real ice block puzzles in the game, do not factor into the proof, all that matters is that ice blocks exist somewhere in the game.<p>So these proofs might point to a potential hard core of cerebral difficulty in games but they ignore many other factors which contribute to enjoyable challengingness. I remember the ice block puzzles in Zelda OoT being pretty tricky, but they certainly don&#x27;t stand out as the most memorable part of the game.",1447691721

Truth is, some combinations and permutations have been observed to be way more likely than others, way before we could meaningfully articulate the underlying mechanisms with anything rigorous.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean that the radically opposite conclusion is true either.

They don&#x27;t take a lot of prep time, but they can severely skew cooking time of other meals because they take longer than other things to cook.<p>If you&#x27;re eating rice, you should combine it with beans to get the complete protein. Buy canned beans only, the bags are a waste of time.<p>Mix and match components at meal time, adding fresh vegetables (onions, peppers, tomatoes, etc.) and seasonings as you go. You can create an incredible variety this way that takes no more than 10 to 15 minutes to prepare for every meal, 5 if you&#x27;re really crushing it.<p>Also, a pork shoulder in a crock pot, covered in seasonings, salt, and beer and set to cook all day Sunday is <i>less</i> than 5 minutes of prep time for probably more meat than you can eat on your own for every meal before it spoils in two weeks.<p>Don&#x27;t overlook spices, salt, and fat. I find the reason most people don&#x27;t like their own homecooked food is because they don&#x27;t season it enough. I can&#x27;t think of a single dish that I make that does not get at least some salt in it, even the few times I make candies. Garlic is similarly overlooked. And don&#x27;t fear fat. Fat is flavor. You need a little to keep things interesting. I personally prefer butter, sesame oil, and filtered bacon fat, as they have strong flavors so not as much is needed.",1447690934

Now this will work for some businesses, as the cost to make the product is low enough, and the sale price high enough, that 20% can be paid and there is still profit left over.  But then there are very low margin, high volume businesses.  They may have only a marginal profit per unit sold due to the nature of what they are selling, leaving no room for 20% tax.<p>So we add in an exception that says &quot;You can deduct from revenue the cost of goods sold&quot; (i.e., tax on net instead of gross).  Now all the business has to do is find ways of hiding profit in the cost of goods sold.<p>Then there are products which contain materials that changed hands many times before it got to the final product.  So if a raw material (lets say, cotton) is the majority expense, it has to go to one company to refine it, a second company to turn it into thread, a third to add color, a fourth to make it into fabric, and finally a fifth company to make a shirt.  So that cotton gets taxed 5 times before it gets sold to the end consumer.<p>So let&#x27;s add another exception, that goods sold for use in making another product aren&#x27;t taxed -- that way, large businesses that produce the entire vertical stack in-house don&#x27;t have an unfair tax advantage against smaller companies.

I used to think that we&#x27;ll reach the proper level of nanotech if we learn to make machines that build themselves pretty much from the scratch. Throw a rock in, out swarm of robots go. I used to think that&#x27;s how nature works. That it eats atoms or simple molecules and then spews out organisms.<p>But it turns out, nature is cheating. There are things that human cells can&#x27;t make. We depend on other, smaller organisms to make them. For instance, we can&#x27;t make vitamins ourselves, we need to source them from outside. It turns out that even for replication, cells need to have proper prefabs available in the environment. For instance, we&#x27;re swimming in nitrogen, and plants can&#x27;t use it anyway because it&#x27;s not in a proper form.<p>Which means that if we want to copy this ability, we need to just focus on &quot;vitamins&quot;. That is, all the hard-to-make stuff that requires large-scale, high-tech industry to be produced. If we can tile the area where a robot operates with universal microcontrollers and accept that as a part of its environment, then the problem of self-replication becomes much easier. There&#x27;s a big volcano^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hfactory operating somewhere, pumping out those small prefabs, and robots are &quot;eating&quot; them and incorporating into themselves and their children.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s cheating.

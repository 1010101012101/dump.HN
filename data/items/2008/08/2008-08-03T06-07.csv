This allows a lot of information with security and privacy implications to flow between sites:<p>* Cookies set in one browser window are delivered with requests made in another browser window<p>* On site A, click a link to site C, and the same link on site B will change color.<p>* Files cached for one browser window are available instantaneously in another window<p>* Site A can use timing to determine if the browser currently has an open HTTP connection to site B<p>* The browser has a per-browser limitation on the number of concurrent connections to a particular web server.  A malicious website could use this to find out when you're browsing another website.<p>Browsers also provide detailed version info to web servers, including plugin versions, allowing malicious sites to deliver the right exploits.<p>ECMA Script implementations do not implement proper resource controls.  For example, bad JavaScript on one page can cause other pages to have slow responses.<p>Third-party cookies allow wholesale tracking<p>Browsers don't complain when the user enters a password into a form that submits to an HTTP url.<p>Browsers keep many cookies literally forever.<p>Even if the user turns off cookies, the cache provides equivalent functionality for tracking.<p>ECMA Script and Flash can pop up modal dialogs that allow one webpage to prevent the user from using others.<p>Browsers don't provide any good UI tools for checking signatures of non-signed certificates.  Many users are conditioned to just click 'Accept Permanently.'<p>Browsers will recall passwords for pages that are shown in i-frames.<p>Browsers should provide stronger anti-phishing mechanisms.  For example, a way to designate a bookmark as the only allowed way to enter that domain.",1217745373

It reminds me of what 37signal's blog comments used to be like while they were still a design firm and making a name for themselves - now the discussions after each post are almost Youtube-level bad.",1217745335

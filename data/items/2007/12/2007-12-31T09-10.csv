There are technical things that need to be in place to put a floor in - to keep things from going to pot, but the most important thing is to put a lot of emphasis on creating a good community and communicating its values to new members.   Some aspects of that that I think are valuable:<p>- No politics.  I think it's even worthwhile to sacrifice things that are (to me) potentially interesting, like economics, where they get too political.  As long as we keep things on the subset of subjects that we know about and are interested in (tech, startups, defined broadly), we're more likely to find common ground, and be able to comment intelligently.<p>- Don't vote people into oblivion unless they're being seriously lame, on purpose.  A 0 or -1 is enough to indicate disapproval.<p>- Don't say things you wouldn't say to someone's face.<p>- If you see something by the user 'pg', be sure to vote it up;-)<p><a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a><p>Has some others.",1199091888

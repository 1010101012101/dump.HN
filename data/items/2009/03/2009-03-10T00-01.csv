It isnt totally my choice to do a 9-5 but certain things happen in life that require that you have a stable income. Im still relatively young (27 and so is my co-founder.)<p>To do a 9-5 and working on a startup at the same time takes alot of resourceful-ness. Juggling responsibilities, making deals with the boss such as <i>working</i> from home agreements ;) occasionally telling <i>white</i> lies because of a major release require testing all takes fast talking.<p>Also getting since money isnt in abundance in our startup, as the money is being used to support family (parents and sister) we have had to come up with alternatives and do alot of our reading to understand the best company structures both for the future and for now from a company structure and taxation point of view.<p>Finally the coding after work until the weee hours of the morning and then getting up at 8:30 to get ready for work again. There is the relentless drive that you need to have and the resourcefulness to make the best of the money and the situation.<p>Reading your articles just highlights that currently we have been doing things the right way, and its good to know.

509326,comment,508918,509061,0,0,akeefer,,,"One important distinction that a lot of agile people make is more around writing down the specs; as the PM you still do work up front to think about what to do, make mockups, do your homework, etc., but when it comes time to communicate to developers it's done as stories (much less detailed than specs) and with in-person communication for clarification (or, under less ideal circumstances, over the phone or e-mail or chat).  The process of getting to the story in the first place ought to involve plenty of back-and-forth, design vetting, and mockups, but once you get there you don't build something based on a spec of any kind.<p>The theory there is that written documents will always be out of date, incomplete, stale, and open to multiple interpretations, so we might as well just accept that the face-to-face communication is infinitely higher bandwidth and will have to happen anyway and not waste the time trying to write it all down up front.<p>So if the PM needs to spec for their own edification, that's fine:  do whatever works for you.  But I, as the developer, will trust the PM themselves as the source of truth as to what the feature should do, and it's the PM's job to know what they want well enough to answer my questions real-time as I'm building.",1236645573

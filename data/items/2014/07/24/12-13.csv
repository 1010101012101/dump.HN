I&#x27;ve been using it extensively, and it has almost gone viral around me. As in, every time someone needs to manage a project, I hear &quot;Hey, what was this simple project management software you told me you&#x27;re using for everything you do?&quot;, and there comes a new Trello user.<p>I even remember using it for managing my own time when I was working for a large Japanese company that was using excel spreadsheets to manage projects, so I could have a clear interface and use a quick and dirty piece of JS I wrote to generate the sacrosanct Daily Reports I was asked to provide.",1406206794

While these mitigation strategies can be expensive up front (estimated cost of $100k per blocking capacitor for a total of $100 million to protect the 1,000 most vulnerable transformers45), the cost of prevention is much smaller than the cost of the damage a single storm can create.&quot;<p>It seems only Canadians are doing at least something?",1406206766

When I&#x27;ve tried other to-do list apps, or project management tools, etc. they all end up becoming too restrictive. They try to teach you to do the right thing in the right way, not realizing that it is different for different people.<p>Joel himself once talked about Excel, and how for most people, Excel isn&#x27;t about spreadsheets, or formulas, or calculations - it&#x27;s about laying things out in a grid. That&#x27;s it. People just want to be able to write things in columns and rows, and colour them. And that simple behaviour is incredibly powerful.",1406206658
8079344,comment,8078494,8079009,2,0,cousin_it,,,"How so? The future AI just needs to have access to the financial records of the organization that created it, so it can find and punish the folks who didn&#x27;t donate enough. No time travel involved, no brain simulations, nothing.<p>Actually, Roko&#x27;s original version of the basilisk was a pretty nice AI that wanted to help people. A hundred people die every minute, how many of them could be saved with better technology? If donating your entire net worth would speed up the AI&#x27;s creation by one day, that could be very worthwhile, according to the combined wishes of all humanity (which are encoded in the AI&#x27;s utility function). Threatening to punish you is a comparatively small price to pay. Especially if you decide to comply, and the punishment never actually happens!<p>At this point you might be indignantly asking, why would the AI decide to punish you in the future? After all, that won&#x27;t help the AI in the future, because its history will already be fixed. But that doesn&#x27;t matter. The AI&#x27;s algorithm tries to choose the most efficient decision overall, from a &quot;position of ignorance&quot;, rather than the most efficient decision at a particular moment in time. Technically, the algorithm tries to find the best input-output mapping according to certain criteria, not find the best output for the particular input it happened to receive. There&#x27;s nothing especially futuristic about such algorithms either, you can implement one as an ordinary Python program today (for toy problems of course).",1406206625

When you have 40+ services, and 100+ of directives, it can become tedious to work on these separate files. That&#x27;s why I recommend to put files that do common stuff together. For example we have <i>auth</i> folder that holds the service, a couple of directives (like for password inputs), all possible states (we use ui-Router) and controllers, in total 8 files: <a href=""http://cl.ly/image/2o0Q1n1m2M32"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/2o0Q1n1m2M32</a>",1406206291

We spend an incredible percentage of the tax &#x27;largesse&#x27; on education and yet we&#x27;re still behind our peers (as defined by international assessment standards).  Why?  I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the &#x27;lack of resources&#x27; mantra drummed repeatedly by the education lobby during election season.  It has to be in some large part that our teachers are compensated (relatively) poorly, and the methods they employ are woeful at best.<p>Typically, as evidenced by the article, we create something of value which is implemented better somewhere else (hello: manufacturing).  Partly this is a socio-economic function germane to the US, but given the amount of focus given to education, it must be something more.<p>I find it difficult to believe that Asian and Finnish students are simply smarter than US students.  Clearly not due to the cheap polemics of Gladwell, et al, that it&#x27;s due to the three dimensional components of Asian languages (seriously??).<p>We are taught relatively poorly, as compared to other students internationally.<p>I am a typical example of this fact.  I was never &#x27;good at math&#x27;.. scoring fairly average on all assessments throughout lower and high schools.  I went to College (above average State school), and decided to major in Computer Science and Mathematics and received my degree.  I was taught (perhaps ironically) by mostly Asian teachers in my majors in ways that required us to think past the rote regurgitation of formulae.<p>I found a new appreciation for math for not only a formalism of logic, but of the Universe.

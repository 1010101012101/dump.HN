1487837,comment,1485060,1487371,0,0,stretchwithme,,,"I think more can be accomplished when people cooperate voluntarily.<p>There is nothing that says people cannot voluntarily enter into contracts to cooperate on many things often seen as things coercive governments must manage.  For example, one can enter into agreements with other property owners in an area that could govern all kinds of things.  No one need be forced to do anything, other than keep their agreements.<p>Freedom is not being free from all commitments and all arrangements.  It is merely being from having them imposed upon you by physical force or threat of it.<p>But some of the things on your list no one would ever agree to.  For example, paying someone when they don't have a job, something they have a lot of control over and which simultaneously gives them the means to not have to take a job.  We're better off if people learn to save their money.  Most can certainly do that.<p>Likewise, deposit insurance takes away all reason to evaluate where you put your money and has certainly subsidized a lot of reckless banking.  I think people who make decisions should bare the risks.  People who have nothing to do with it should not be forced to bare such risk.<p>Other things on your list would continue under a more private system.  People would still fund long term research; companies do that now too.  Perhaps you've heard of Xerox PARC, HP Labs, IBM and Bell Laboratories.<p>And if you've got a private highway, you're going to require people know how to drive on it.  Why wouldn't you?  You lose money when there are accidents.  You'll probably even come up with a way to keep drunks off of your road.<p>The wealth concentration you fear is frequently empowered by the very government you think prevents it.  The corporations control the government now.<p>Who handed the lands and right of ways to the railroads?  Who stood by as they lied to farmers to get them to move out there where they only lifeline was the railroad?  Who told BP their liability was limited to $75 million?  Some might even go as far as saying it is no coincidence that the rise of big business parallels the rise of big government.<p>And as for being less liberty protecting, I really don't see how a government that fiercely enforces individual rights will not be protecting them.<p>Just because things have been done a certain way doesn't mean things can't be done in a better way.  But I certainly don't expect people to drop the current approaches without having those alternatives being demonstrated as better.<p>I see things as very incremental.  A lot of things have gotten bad because of whole series of less than optimal choices.  We can certainly move towards better systems incrementally.",1278323930

1487835,comment,1486017,1487324,0,0,detst,,,"All of the above. It could be a person from anywhere without a distinctly regional accent. The news person is the common example. It's what Veronica Corningstone refers to in Anchorman when she says, ""But while they're laughing and grab-assing, I'm chasing down leads and practicing my non-regional diction.""<p>People that <i>think</i> they have this accent or that someone else has this accent will often refer to it as ""no accent"". It's not an ethnocentric viewpoint. Now, I definitely think the average person is not aware of how distinctive their accent really is and mistakenly think they have a non-regional one. But I do think it exists.<p>Just to give an example off the top of my head: take Conan O'Brien. He's from Boston, went to college in Boston but does he have a Boston accent? Maybe you could pick it out of his voice, but the average person probably wouldn't and he certainly doesn't have a strong one.",1278323849

The idea is that happiness is merely relief from things that make us unhappy.  That is, there is nothing that makes us happy, there are only things that make us unhappy.<p>My view on this subject is that you can be happy by distracting yourself from the things that make you unhappy.  I find being in The Zone (that place where you go when you concentrate on something and forget about everything else) to be a great example of such distraction.  Unfortunately, it is difficult to get into and stay in The Zone.",1278323579

It's still the form preferred by the Oxford English Dictionary: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_spelling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_spelling</a><p>On the others, there's a bit more of a continuum than everyone using the British spellings, though I'll agree the Commonwealth probably tilts towards more similarity with the UK than with the US. But Canadian spelling, especially, aligns with U.S. usage in a lot of respects: it generally uses -ize rather than -ise endings (""realize"", not ""realise""), and sides with the Americans on a lot of specific one-off differences (""tire"", not ""tyre""), though it sides with the U.K. spellings on -our vs. -or (""colour"", not ""color"").",1278320959

1487764,comment,1486017,1486907,0,0,stan_rogers,,,"Well, until recently we've managed to avoid the vowel flattening and raising that has been pretty much a constant throughout the US since independence. We're accused of saying ""oot"", ""aboot"" and ""hoose"", but what we hear from our neighbours to the south is ""aot"", ""abaot"" and ""haose"" -- the vowel being a tail-rounded flat ""a"" to the Canadian ear. (We use the same vowel in ""house"", the verb form, which is distinguished in Canadian speach by more than just the zeddifying of the ess.)<p>That being said, one shouldn't be deceived into thinking that there is a single Canadian English dialect or accent -- we have a number of regional variants. The upper crust of both Ontario and Quebec (the former Upper and Lower Canada) both spoke with an essentially North American vocabulary and a ""mid-Atlantic"" accent (the sort of halfway meeting between RP and mid-American that, say, Deutche Welle would use for its English-language world news service). The lower classes in the same provinces were, like the American south, far more heavily influenced by Cornish, Kentish, Geordie, Scots and Scottish and Irish gaelic -- but without the black feedback loop. Nova Scotia has several accents, ranging from the heavily Gaelic Cape Breton to the German Lunenberg. Newfoundland ""English"" is a language of its own -- the accent is a Gaelic-heavy mix, but the grammar is very much Irish Gaelic. British Columbia speaks an odd mix of SoCal and Pacific Northwest with a tiny tinge of RP in the mix. Manitoba and Saskatchewan are essentially indistinguishable from rural Pennsylvania, but for an odd metre that leaked in from the local aboriginal languages. And, well, Alberta is a State at heart -- I don't think an American would have any difficulty picking out the new economic immigrants to that province from the natives in a sentence or two. There is a lot of overlap between political borders, of course, but there are several distinct regional dialects.",1278320572

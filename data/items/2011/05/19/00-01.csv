Assuming you could even fetch them (they probably are rate limited) the whois record could change without indicating an ownership change or even the DNS could change without indicating an ownership change.  Also, even if there was no change in these records, the owner might have changed.  The new owner, if an attacker, could put the same data into the whois record and use the same DNS records.  The domain may never even ""expire"" officially with some registrars letting a new owner grab a domain before the official expiration drop.<p>I assume the previous owner probably has some mechanism for deleting the accounts that are currently on Google Apps.

2562461,comment,2560879,2561694,6,0,strlen,,,"C's syntax is different from Python's for a reason: what each operator does is very much transparent from the syntax. The point of learning C is to understand what the computer does (as you program it in a higher level language).<p>In Python, I can say:<p><pre><code>  ...\n  if ""foo"" in bar:\n    do_something()\n</code></pre>\nThat's excellent, that's what I expect from a high level language. However, I am not forced to think about whether bar is a hash table (dictionary) an array, or something else. That, again, is excellent for the kind programming you do with Python: you're programming to an interface and not an implementation. Java's standard library also encourages that.<p><pre><code>   Collection<String> bar = getBar();\n   ...\n   if(bar.contains(""foo"")) { \n</code></pre>\nHowever, you also need to understand how the various containers implement ""__contains__"" or "".contains()"". That is, you need to understand algorithms, pointers (in Python and Java, every value is a pointer and memory leaks are still possible!), memory management. C is a better language for learning these fundamentals than Python or Java.<p>Of course, Python and Java (and also, Smalltalk and Lisp/CLOS) are much better languages for learning object oriented design and ""design patterns"" in the classical sense. However, I've found that I never quite ""got"" OO until I had already had a job as a software engineer. I would have never gotten a job as a software engineer without knowing the fundamentals. I also feel that having grown up on C has been an advantage in terms of being able to reason about systems aspects of my work, even though professionally I mostly worked in C++ (with STL), Perl/Python and Java.<p>C's syntax as being applied to high level languages is a different matter. I agree it doesn't make much sense for Java: for example, lack of any type inference is really annoying. Perhaps that's why I find programming in Scala to be more pleasant, even when I am writing imperative code. I agree, it can be annoying to use a syntax meant for a low-level language to write in a strongly typed, memory-safe high level language. However, the syntax is not the most important part of a language, especially for pedagogic purposes.",1305765806

You would have to insure it as both a plane and as a car, and insurance companies aren't going to know how to handle that, which means they'll either refuse to touch it or charge a premium.  Even if such vehicles became common enough for insurance companies to get comfortable with them, they're still probably on the expensive side for cars, and repairing collision damage on airplanes costs a lot more than repairing comparable damage on cars.  That's not normally such a big deal because collisions are much less common for airplanes, but with this vehicle you would combine the high collision risk of a car with the high repair costs of an airplane.<p>Second, and more importantly: maintenance.  The FAA requires that periodic inspections and preventative maintenance be conducted at regular intervals, and those intervals are defined in terms of <i>the number of hours the engine has been operating</i>[1].

2562394,comment,2542995,2560887,1,0,beefman,,,"Today's nuclear (e.g. AP1000) is splendid technology by any measure. AP1000 builds are designed to last 60 years but should be economically maintainable for hundreds (life of the containment, which is the expensive part).<p>Amortized over 40 years, the nominal cost of nuclear is very low - on par with coal. The barrier to rapid buildout is the high upfront cost. Operation is almost free. Standardized plant designs like the AP1000 should cure most construction delays. The Chinese builds currently underway were ahead of schedule last I checked.<p>The externalities of energy sources are poorly studied, nuclear being by far the best-studied. In the US, waste disposal is fully paid per kWh and has been since the early '80s. Mining and everything to do with the fuel chain is far cleaner than anything else, including wind and solar (it was my job to study these things for a certain fruity company that has no vested interest in any particular technology). Regulation in the US is also paid-for by the industry (NRC charges astronomical fees).<p>As you probably know, safety per GWh is found to be on par with wind and solar by every study out there.<p>The factor of 500 corresponds to burning Th232 instead of U235 (490 precisely).  Burning U238 will give you a factor of 140 instead. Either will additionally save the need for enrichment, though turns out to be a tiny factor. High-temp operation with either fuel will get you 5/3 in the thermal efficiency dept. Atmospheric pressure operation gives you something like a factor of 10 on plant materials, which is not terribly significant on a per-GWh basis.<p>All of these have been demonstrated - most decades ago. There's no basic physics, just engineering. 10 years to market for any serious effort. Where you might need 50 years is something like a dusty plasma reactor. Those directly convert fission energy to electricity (thus reaching efficiencies over 90%) and can also enable interstellar travel. Still easier than fusion.<p>For solar efficiency there's a factor of 3 to the Carnot limit and wind is less than a factor of 2 from the Betz limit. Further improvements can come by making the collectors lighter. But solar cells are already thinner than can weather the elements and so are mounted on substrates, under cover glass, on stands and tracking motors etc. About the best that can be done is mirrors with a central thermal tower, and this is being done today. Tethered wind has potential for reducing the utterly absurd material requirements of current turbines - Makani says a factor of 5.<p>Those are available improvements, since you mentioned it. Absolutes are what count. For solar, plan to cover about the same amount of land as has been paved to date (assuming ideal location).<p>I don't know what renewables are. Do they include geothermal? Howabout induced geothermal? What about fission (supernovae aren't renewable)? Biofuels (are fresh water, fertilizer, arable land etc. renewable)? Is wind renewable?\n<a href=""http://www.earth-syst-dynam.net/2/1/2011/esd-2-1-2011.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.earth-syst-dynam.net/2/1/2011/esd-2-1-2011.html</a>\nWhat about hydroelectric (we seem to have run out of rivers to dam)?

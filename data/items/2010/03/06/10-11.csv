1171384,comment,1171083,1171083,0,0,Tichy,,,"I don't see the advice in this article. Surely, for any project, you either finish it, or you don't. There is no other choice.<p>The only thing that seems possible is to decide for some projects to quit trying to finish them and erase them from the mind. But the article offers no help in deciding when to draw that line. Just because a project takes longer than expected? I don't think that would be very useful.<p>It seems to me the advice here just mounts more pressure on projects. Now it's not only ""I should finish it"", but also ""I should decide if I finish it or not"" - merely letting them stay in some corner won't do anymore.",1267871640

I wouldn't care about that much, but when somebody looks at the site with unexpectedly large fonts (and not even very large, with common 67 columns paragraphs and default posterous themes, it happens quite too often), the browser will break lines sooner than the hard break, and then again at the next line, after few characters. That sort of sucks.",1267869830

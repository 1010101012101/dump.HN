7967956,comment,7964848,7967738,3,0,spacehome,,,"Bring it back to the scientific method.  The way to differentiate between competing hypotheses is by devising experiments that falsify some of them, and then running the experiments and either falsifying or failing to falsify them.<p>The issue here is subtle, and it&#x27;s that the most popular interpretation, Copenhagen, isn&#x27;t a complete theory because it doesn&#x27;t tell you algorithmically when collapse occurs.  For any possible algorithmic way to handle collapse, there&#x27;s a corresponding experiment that could (at least in theory) differentiate between Copenhagen and Many Worlds.  But the Copenhagen is inordinately slippery in that collapse is defined to occur ex post facto in whatever way is needed to make the experimental results match the theoretical results.<p>It&#x27;s perhaps not so surprising that this shortcoming was overlooked in the beginning because Copenhagen was hypothesized before we really had a clear handle on the study of algorithms.  But the fact that Copenhagen is still as popular as it is means that Yudkowski needs to spend a lot of time on philosophy of science, because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s holding back most people from seeing the problems with Copenhagen, and why at first glance it looks like philosophy.",1404165094

Kuhn&#x27;s point (and mine, by transitivity) is that scientists are human with unavoidable biases, and these biases will influence what work they do.<p>The reason I don&#x27;t know how to answer your question is that I interpret it to mean: what tangible result do we have before we have our first tangible result?<p>Of course, if that&#x27;s not what you mean, then please clarify. You may want to read his book, though, as this concept is central to some of it. If you&#x27;re saying, &quot;what is the effect of such paradigms before they change,&quot; then it&#x27;s best to read his book. One point he makes is that everyone operates under a paradigm, whether conscious of it or not. That is, we must think about our scientific work in <i>some</i> way, and whatever way we think about it will influence what scientific work we do. It is generally the case, though, that many people have some form of agreement on that &quot;some way.&quot; When we do, that sets informal bounds on what is &quot;acceptable science.&quot;<p>He does use quantum mechanics as an example, but that&#x27;s loaded because we&#x27;re still hashing it out.

Instead of abstract arrows, EY goes straight to complex numbers. It goes through a basic approach to quantum mechanics (taking diagrams from here for instance: <a href=""http://www.qi.damtp.cam.ac.uk/node/60"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.qi.damtp.cam.ac.uk/node/60</a>) in a modern way and tries to build an intuitive understanding of the subject, especially demolishing a lot of confusions one may have gained through popular media. He then departs from the basic theory to elaborate on why the collapse interpretation is ridiculous and why Many-Worlds makes more sense. You can stop when you get to the Timeless stuff.<p>You&#x27;re not really going to find anything ground-breaking, but it may help your intuitions about QM even if you&#x27;re a physicist. As a chapter from the Aaronson book (<a href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec9.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec9.html</a>) I linked to in a cousin comment says in the first two paragraphs:<p><i>There are two ways to teach quantum mechanics. The first way -- which for most physicists today is still the only way -- follows the historical order in which the ideas were discovered. So, you start with classical mechanics and electrodynamics, solving lots of grueling differential equations at every step. Then you learn about the &quot;blackbody paradox&quot; and various strange experimental results, and the great crisis these things posed for physics. Next you learn a complicated patchwork of ideas that physicists invented between 1900 and 1926 to try to make the crisis go away. Then, if you&#x27;re lucky, after years of study you finally get around to the central conceptual point: that nature is described not by probabilities (which are always nonnegative), but by numbers called amplitudes that can be positive, negative, or even complex.<p>Today, in the quantum information age, the fact that all the physicists had to learn quantum this way seems increasingly humorous. For example, I&#x27;ve had experts in quantum field theory -- people who&#x27;ve spent years calculating path integrals of mind-boggling complexity -- ask me to explain the Bell inequality to them. That&#x27;s like Andrew Wiles asking me to explain the Pythagorean Theorem.</i><p>(And on EY himself, just read the million or so words of the Sequences and you&#x27;ll see he is actually really smart across multiple domains. ;))",1404163100

For example you can collect errors (not only panics) and then send them to Sentry easily.<p>The control flow is interesting: if a middleware calls c.Abort(code) or c.Fail(code, message), the rest handlers in the chain would never be called, this is very useful when authorisation is required. <a href=""https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/blob/master/auth.go#L76"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/blob/master/auth.go#L76</a><p>Of course authorisation can be just applied to a group, you can see example in the github page. Per-group middlwares and even per-request middlewares!<p>We added all that features without making it significantly slower (compared to httprouter) and for sure that overhead will be reduced in upcoming releases (no API changes). If you want to use HttpRouter and you also want cool features, in my opinion Gin is one of the best choices. Just try it.",1404163031

Given what the Snowden leaks have revealed, I think the NSA, and possibly lower-level entities, could find him even now. They can attack gmx.com, AnonymousSpeech, Digirock, the Californian IP & Freenode, & the P2P Foundation looking for direct IP leaks or other information, either through penetration, legal demands, or their extensive databases of metadata; governments are the main sponsors of stylometric research (either code or writing), which are another excellent attack vector; and of course, they can simply do tailored attacks on major suspects, in the same way they&#x27;ve already individually gone after security researchers. For all we know, they&#x27;ve already done any of this - Snowden&#x27;s info is dated.",1404162348

This may be somewhat cheaper than having a person driving you around or something, but I really think that on balance people will end up having their own personal vehicles.<p>All I was responding to was that <i>if</i> you grant the parent comment&#x27;s assertion that people will move to car services, it&#x27;s very likely to me that <i>rush hour</i> will be the one problem that is very easy to solve, because you would have such a large volume of people all going to the same place. Even the issues with personal space and shared vehicles aren&#x27;t that big of a problem - self-driving cars don&#x27;t need to look the way they look now. You could have 4 separate compartments in them, so that it&#x27;s not possible to touch or interact with the other passengers, for example. (Also, I&#x27;ve participated in casual carpool in both New York and San Francisco, and it works remarkably well - many people, including young women, <i>do</i> travel every day in the car of a complete stranger that they don&#x27;t know - and it&#x27;s even more dangerous, because it&#x27;s controlled by a human driver!)<p>My guess is, however, that in the future the hardware costs of under-utilized vehicles will be considered to be much lower than the &quot;inconvenience costs&quot; of not having your own vehicle, and rates of car ownership won&#x27;t be dramatically affected by the advent of the self-driving car.",1404162213

In the case of the US, as it happens, most national debt is overwhelmingly owned by Americans --think your IRA: whatever percentage of bonds you own is government debt to <i>you</i>.<p>The confusion arises because one particular strategy of hedge funds in the past has been to buy up huge controlling amounts of dollar-denominated bonds/debt from small export-dependent countries so that, if the country&#x27;s economy slows down and they have to devaluate their currencies to boost exports (and thus growth), they end up unadvertently increasing the amount owed to the hedge funds in dollars.  This can easily get way out of hand, thus causing the well-publicized financial crises of the 1990s, Argentina&#x27;s, Greece[1] <i>etc</i>.

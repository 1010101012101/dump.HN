Of course Ruby has a String class and plenty of methods on it, but I'm not sure if that's what you're talking about.<p>Ruby comes with an XML library standard, sure, but it's pretty bad. In my experience most people use competing libraries, of which there are several high quality options.

682257,comment,682063,682063,0,0,mahmud,,,"I always write the most elegant demos and proof-of-concept code, and it goes down hill as it gets fleshed out. Later, I go back to rework it into a library and driver; all software can be made into a bunch of libraries and a ""driver"". Each library has a useable API, the driver code looks tight, but individual libs look really horrible behind the scenes.<p>It's all engineering tradeoffs. The elegant things are sometimes slow or bloated, and the fast things are hackish and dirty.<p>One thing that repeatedly screws me over is data representation. SQL tends to creep into the object system, because it's far <i>cheaper</i> to store and ID than a whole object. However, it's <i>easier</i> to store a whole object in memory than to make repeated trips to database.<p>Language conveniences creep in; it's far easier for me as Lisper to parse a SQL row into a list, even easier to make that into a class instance. Regular expressions; keep those fuckers out of your code if you can help it, for anything but the first stage of a parsing script, regexes should be done without.<p>One thing I found out is that ""cushion"" code, stuff that is meant to make your programming easier, remains in the program and never leaves. Instead of forgetting a horrible backdoor in the code, it's far easier to refactor it early and put the necessary debugging features in place. It's tempting to leave out error checking when you're not even sure you need the function to begin with, but we should be careful. I found out today that my FIND-USER function returned a valid USER object with a valid USER-ID but not login name or password. You chould actually go to www.mysite.com/home/USER-ID/ and be served a fresh account outside my billing system. Fuck me DEAD!<p>P.S. Flow is a double-edged sword. If your code is brittle and academic, there might come a point one night when you type a few more forms and the whole things springs to life. It's beautiful to watch your creation come alive, you never want it to die, so your brain selects the kinds test data and you babysit your toy to full function avoiding all the embarassing crashes in between and possible throwing in the occassional IF-test to save face before yourself. You go and go, putting in more stuff and watch a few more milestones far from the distant future drop dead at your feet as you pass over them between coffee and cigarette breaks in that glorious night. Congratulations, you just caught the flow, here is hopping you will enjoy the next month of frustrated rewriting and fine-tooth combing through your inspired mess ;-)",1246434385

682254,comment,682101,682101,0,0,Bjoern,,,"Why language X is better of Y makes no sense. Every language has its benefits and downsides. Python has been slighly longer around and has a bigger user community which resulted in more available library code. Ruby and Python is pretty much interchangable  in the sense of features as they often steal from each other and vice versa.<p>Ruby<p>- follows TIMTOWTDI<p>- Mutable strings etc.<p>- has a greater emphasis on code generation (""meta"")<p>- VM's are much slower than Python (there is no Psycho etc.)<p>- emphasizes code clearity and readabiliy (human cycles are 
more important)<p>- Libraries are much less mature<p>- ...<p>The lists of differences could go on forever. A comparsion and ""why"" is difficult.

Why have an end be anymore than 1 character on a serious note, that is lots of keystrokes extra not needed.<p>But more seriously Python is a growth like Javascript.  It has grown and adapted to every change it has been required because it has a very rapid iteration time and is great for wrappers to core C.  It is clean and maintainable.<p>For this it has made huge inroads to system administration, game development, tool plugins, web development, command tasks and everything else.  I have yet to have one instance where there weren't numerous libraries for every task.

It is a functional language, it is an OO language and it can be procedural. It can wrap intense lower level libraries or port in a C extension for speed.

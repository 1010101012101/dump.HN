There were two (main) known players, and the threat of mutually assured destruction kept the Cold War from becoming hot. Now we have one known (main) player- the US, and a number of unknowns. You can&#x27;t threaten mutually assured destruction upon Al Qaeda because it isn&#x27;t a nation state.<p>So while the threat of <i>global</i> conflict has diminished, the threat of conflict has not.

Doing some math, if the Concorde had 100 passengers and flew at 1,350 mph, that&#x27;s 135,000 / 6,800 = 20 passenger-miles per gallon.

It was nearly perfect, the official says. But it processed such a large amount of data that it picked up more Americans than the other systems. Though ThinThread was intended to intercept foreign communications, it continued documenting signals when a trail crossed into the U.S. This was a big problem: federal law forbade the monitoring of domestic communications without a court warrant. And a warrant couldnt be issued without probable cause and a known suspect. In order to comply with the law, Binney installed privacy controls and added an anonymizing feature, so that all American communications would be encrypted until a warrant was issued. The system would indicate when a pattern looked suspicious enough to justify a warrant.</i><p><i>But this was before 9/11, and the N.S.A.s lawyers deemed ThinThread too invasive of Americans privacy. In addition, concerns were raised about whether the system would function on a huge scale, although preliminary tests had suggested that it would. In the fall of 2000, [General Michael Hayden, the director of the N.S.A.,] decided not to use ThinThread, largely because of his legal advisers concerns .</i><p>I&#x27;m sure it discarded some things, but the basic technical control that ThinThread appeared to have that Trailblazer (and PRISM) lacked is cryptographic authorization controls.",1376067364

As Ubuntu is focusing on a converged experience with phone hardware driving the desktop as well, it would be better for the hardware to be better than what the industry is expected to deliver by 2014.

Tptacek was right when he said:<p><i>Obama could give a speech in the Rose Garden this week carefully explaining that NSA requires access to American communications, all of them, in order to defend the country against terrorist attacks, and that while privacy is &quot;important&quot;, the expectation of perfect privacy in your cell phone and Internet communications isn&#x27;t reasonable because it helps terrorist cells without providing much benefit.<p>I would recoil from such a speech, but the public probably would not.<p>The American public currently has a weak expectation of privacy in their electronic communications. But they make virtually no meaningful demand for that privacy. Thwarting terror attacks are a much higher priority to them. Want evidence of that? Well, the body-conscious, vain, generally out-of-shape American public routinely submits to electronic strip searches to get onto airplanes. You think they care if someone&#x27;s screening their calls to catch Abu Shahid?
They would accept that argument. And with that acceptance, the expectations of privacy and the notion of what &quot;reasonable&quot; searches are would be, in short order, redefined --- those rights being explicitly predicated on contemporary mores by the Constitution.<p>When I look at it from this angle, it becomes apparent that while privacy is inconvenient to the USG, and something they feel they have to work around, it&#x27;s not something they&#x27;re intent on eliminating. Despite the rhetoric from the tech punditry, the USG has not stated that it&#x27;s reasonable for them to surveil US citizens; their defense has instead been that they are not surveilling them.

Tobacco has to be heavily cured and processed (not necessarily with chemicals, but certainly with lots of other methods) to be usable.  It&#x27;s not something that any old joe would want to do themselves due to how labor intensive it is.  Plus, tobacco is a super finicky plant.<p>MJ, once dried, can be used with zero processing.  If you consider drying to be processing, then yes, its a one step process.  Not saying that these folks wouldn&#x27;t make plenty of money off of the convenience factor, but the barrier to entry for MJ wholesaling is much lower due to the reduced processing.",1376066652

For one is that it replacement omits or undervalues the cost to acquire and retrain a replacement to being a) competent in the context of the position, and longer term b) being truly integrated into the company and able to bring deeper value to the business.<p>Time to a) can be short, particularly if the candidate is a good fit, but time to b) is typically three years. Early in my career, I took a little offense when a manager once told me that it would take three years to become useful. After some discussion, that wasn&#x27;t a comment about my technical ability or level of work (they were actually very happy about that), but it was just a realistic timeline to get to b), the point that they could throw about anything at me and I could reliably pull resources and people together to get things done for the company in an independent and cost-effective manner. Depending on the work, time to (b) could be shorter or longer, but it&#x27;s surprisingly long - longer than many want to admit to themselves. Over the years, I&#x27;ve looked at people in companies through this lens, and three years is typical.<p>Companies with an employee &quot;replacement cost&quot; model often have churn rates so employees stay with the company well below (b).<p>The &quot;replacement cost&quot; model also leads unwillingness to invest in employees, either by explicit training, or on the job training anticipating increased responsibilities. After all, they might be gone soon and we just have to go shopping for a replacement.<p>Longer term employees (typically the mid-level management) are then stuck because they&#x27;re managing details that they really wouldn&#x27;t otherwise need to, masking time to take care of problems that they would otherwise should be the sole owners of.<p>They&#x27;re both subtle outgrowths of undervaluing people, leading to company underperformance.",1376064973

If what people want is someone to be accountable, people will get scapegoats.<p>The key difference would be that when acts happen that defy the needs and expectations of society that those actions end.<p>If Keith Alexander was blamed for acting without authorization and imprisoned for treason and then NSA operations went quietly on their way again, that wouldn&#x27;t necessarily mean anything.<p>If on the other hand, there was no punishment doled out, but instead any apology was given out and the PRISM program and similar were dismantled, and a new intelligence system were built in its place with support and approval from the public. Maybe something with proper auditable checks and balances, something with less risk to the public.  If that was the case, even if nobody was punished, the situation would improve.<p>Calling for punishment or vengeance will satisfy emotions.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything to change the status quo.  I&#x27;m not in the US, but if I were, I wouldn&#x27;t be calling for the President to be held accountable, or anyone else.  I would be calling for change of the laws and processes that I felt were violating my rights.<p>I think this is especially true in a system as complex as government.  There is no one person truly responsible for these systems.  So to focus on punishing a person is meaningless.  People can be forced to do things despite the potential punishment.  People can have decisions made by more powerful people attributed to them.<p>In the end though, it is more important that bad behavior stops than it is that we exact retribution on some person for it happening.

The transformation that began with Cox and Carter in 1977 and was later carried on by Lapierre took time to gain strength. Even in the mid 90&#x27;s I&#x27;d say the NRA was not as strong as it is today.<p>The 1994 assault weapons ban was a wakeup call, and probably contributed to the rapid sales growth of that type of rifle (it&#x27;s the fastest growing segment in the industry today), which increases support for the NRA - you see how it goes. The more they try to ban the stronger the gun rights folks get. In 1994, AR15&#x27;s were a niche product that even some gun owners scoffed at as useless. Today they are very much mainstream.<p>There also seems to be a rise in Libertarian-like thought across all parties these days that probably contributes to the NRA&#x27;s cause.<p>But it is a mistake to paint the NRA as a Republican organization. It is far from it. That Republicans tend to support the NRA is a fact, but the NRA is non-partizan.

Heck read the 8th and consider how broadly solitary confinement is used as punishment in our prisons. Or how anti-drug and anti-marriage laws restrict personal choice. To me, protection of our broad Rights against the Leviathan is the issue of our time.<p>That said, the 2nd Amendment is also an ally in this fight. In contrast to Privacy, the right of gun ownership is explicitly guaranteed and the NRA is a partner in questions of privacy. We just need to help them realize that the national security apparatus could easily be expanded inwards to target gun owners. We need to help them realize that the technology to do so is already trivial for the Big Bad Government.",1376064319

Invasiveness has nothing to do with specificity, and the shock value of the piece was clearly intended to come from the opening of the mail and inserting of the ads, not that the service &quot;keeps profiles,&quot; which was just a brief aside in the post. Obviously, it&#x27;s an analogy. Nothing about it is literal. However, analogies are supposed to bear resemblance to the real world, which this doesn&#x27;t do and which is why it&#x27;s detrimental to the discussion around these issues. That was my original point.<p>The OP clearly objects to relinquishing your data in general. He links to articles about &quot;owning your own data&quot; in the footer. I don&#x27;t think this primarily about targeted ads. What if the post office opened and replicated every piece of mail that you sent or received, then kept it on file in case you needed it at some point. This eliminates any adverse reaction that might come from advertising while providing a valuable service. Do you think that the content of this post is condoning that? I&#x27;m not 100% sure of the OP&#x27;s intentions, but this piece seems discourage relinquishing your data in general. It paints with an incredibly broad brush and fails to acknowledge the complexity of this issue. That is <i>precisely</i> why I don&#x27;t like it.<p>If storing mail is bad even without ads simply because it makes you susceptible to surveillance, doesn&#x27;t that validate the OP&#x27;s point that storing of any kind is bad?

While most pro-gun people are pro their own personal privacy, and pro gun owner privacy (anti-registry), there&#x27;s absolutely a large contingent who are fine with the government keeping watchful eyes on &quot;those other people&quot;, within and without the US, so it&#x27;s not as if NRA members are inherently anti-NSA/pro-privacy either.<p>I ultimately care about the tech/crypto/privacy issue a lot more than guns (which I also care about, along with low taxes, non-intrusive regulation, drug decriminalization, open immigration, etc).

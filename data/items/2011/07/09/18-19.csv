2746113,comment,2745761,2746082,0,0,carsongross,,,"Yeah, really, even conceding the inventory rebuild/weak dollar rally in that chart.  I don't think that the aggregate numbers produced by the Fed are always useful when looking at the economy: the composition of the aggregates is usually so diverse as to render the aggregate meaningless.  GDP is a canonical example.<p>The U.S. retains industrial capacity in high end and military areas, but that isn't going to help average people produce items that are valuable to one another and to people in other places, which is the core way to build wealth.  We've masked this fact with debt for the last 30 years, and now it appears that that game is over.",1310237950

2746110,comment,2745773,2745773,31,0,gruseom,,,"Gerald Weinberg's <i>Secrets of Consulting</i> is a masterful (yet whimsical) meditation on this subject. It's one of the few business books everybody should read, except it isn't really a business book, it's a people book. Much of the material is counterintuitive. It's kind of like Dale Carnegie for human irrationality.<p>The book begins with the premise that just because someone is paying you for advice doesn't mean they actually want your advice. It goes on to argue that successful consulting is not about fixing problems so much as navigating contradictions.<p>The other profession that deals intimately with contradictions between what people say, feel, and do is psychotherapy. I've often thought that consulting is therapy for businesses - a curious kind of therapy that by consensus is never explicitly discussed. Weinberg learned a lot from his excursions in the psychotherapy world, and this book is his best distillation of it.",1310237913

They still want a society where people get paid decently for working, where there is a social safety net, where anyone can go to the doctor without going bankrupt.  NONE of these opinions have changed in the American people.  Nor has the work dynamic fundamentally changed.  America still produces tons of shit.<p>But the opinions of the American leadership elite have changed.  A dysfunctional one-party system is the problem, and the result is a consensus view - among the Washington elite only - that the rich need to get richer and everyone else needs to get poorer.  It doesn't have to be this way.  But change isn't going to come from inside the Beltway.<p>This can change, and will, eventually.

It certainly seems many scientific discoveries are made by a scientist observing or experiencing something, noticing that it is strange, then investigating.  A perfect example of this is the development of microwaves, which came about because an engineer working on radar noticed that a candy bar started to melt when near the radar.  Robots are certainly superior by almost every metric once you know what you're looking for, but I wouldn't be so sure that we actually know what we are looking for.  Boots on the ground, so to speak, can offer insights that a robot simply cannot.",1310235841

By this I mean that you have many options using their custom JavaScript API, but you get little control over the final product.<p>Conversely, while I ended up using Phonegap for a couple of published apps, I quickly ran into the limitations inherent of that framework. One big example was the desire to play video (either remote or local). The feature simply doesn't exist in the framework.<p>Despite the lack of features in some aspects, phonegap is still my preferred framework because it's extensible. I get the benefit of rapid development using html5, CSS, and js while being able to edit or add objective-c code where needed to make extra stuff work.<p>My final conclusions were that Phonegap is good for phase 1 apps or apps that are relatively simple.

What's the worst that can happen?"" The fact of the matter is that a lot can happen that can have long-term consequences that should be weighed and considered.<p>I admire entrepreneurs that can make incredible leaps of faith, but we typically only hear about the ones who succeed. There's also ones who took the leap with nothing to land on and came up short. There's also ones who carefully planned and took a ""controlled leap.""<p>Also, what does every action sports star, race car driver or  soldier say? They say it would be more dangerous if they weren't at least <i>a little</i> scared of failing, and that elements of fear keep you attentive and energized. The same applies in entrepreneurship.<p>""Failure"" carries different consequences depending on the person and the situation. To some, failing means they lost some investor's money and are on to the next project, or for some could mean having to find a job. While it could mean bankruptcy to others. Depending on circumstances, not everyone can afford to be so cavalier and needs to be a little more analytical.<p>Fear of failure is part of entrepreneurship and its historically the hurdle that separates entrepreneurs from everyone else.

That person was W Edwards Deming.<p>Deming was involved in the US Army's post-WWII rebuilding of Japan.  Specifically, he was a statistician hired to help with Japan's census.  His focus on quality control was revolutionary at the time, and his work became adopted throughout corporate Japan.  He is seen as the father of Total Quality Management.  He laid the foundations for decades of Japanese excellence in quality control in manufacturing and industry.<p>The problem, of course, is that the rest of the world is now well versed on TQM, and has adopted TQM principles.  This is why the average car lasts 100s of thousands of miles today, when such quality was unheard of in the 1960s.<p>Of course, all of the other aspects mentioned have contributed--rising wages, managers replacing engineers, etc etc.  But the root cause of all of this is that their competitive advantage that results from a focus on quality is gone now.",1366228539

Specifically, I completely disagree with the ""leave it to industry standards"" approach, as that doesn't help people understand what they should do, and more importantly, why.<p>Request/response protocols (well, many things) really break down into 5 top-level categories (some sources will say the 6th is Audit):<p>- Authentication<p>- Authorization<p>- Integrity<p>- Confidentiality<p>- Non-repudiation<p>It's a far more interesting exercise to walk through what you would get from each solution.  Basic-Auth over TLS, actually gets you quite a ways towards that goal (specifically, C-I-A (authentication)). Where that, and notably HMAC, fall over is non-repudiation because they're based on a shared-secret model; admittedly HMAC keys are better than passwords because you're not sending the secret on every request, but asymmetric crypto is preferred.  Authorization that the\nserver system does is really out of scope in all of these protocols, so Basic-Auth over TLS doesn't really impact that one. It can be as simple as ""caller = owner,"" or as full-featured as a security policy language [1] (full disclosure: I am the original author of [1]).<p>OAuth really doesn't differ that much besides specifically solving the delegated access and website SSO problem(s); but IMO it does so with an overly baroque protocol that has too many parts.  The ""long pole"" of setting up such a system (that is, allowing 3rd party sites to act on behalf of my site's users) isn't the specifics of what my REST api\nlooks like, but really it's all the ""governance"" of user decisions, and more-over, key management (in all these cases, key management is generally the hardest or almost hardest problem).<p>While it can be debated whether it was right or wrong, we (Joyent) released an open-source spec to solve straight up authentication of REST requests using SSH keys [2].  At the end of the day, the user signs the Date header of requests with their private key (which by definition the server has never seen), and all requests must be over TLS.  Disregarding Authorization, this scheme gives you Confidentiality (TLS), Integrity (TLS), Authentication (Signature), Non-Repudiation (asymmetric signature), and adds a ""poor man's nonce,""\nassuming you disallow requests where the clock skew of the date header is too large.  And lastly, SSH solves a lot of key management problems for humans. Note: I didn't drop that reference to advocate for our specification here, but rather the security process you should think about when evaluating whether a protocol is secure.<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policy-reference.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policy-refer...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature/blob/master/http_signing.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature/blob/master/ht...</a><p>PS<p>Mutual-Auth SSL/TLS is a royal PITA, and is basically guaranteed to cause you grief.  The client compatibility matrix might as well be considered an NP hard problem to assure yourself coverage, and failure modes of the different browsers/SDKs all differ.

It's all what they expect you to know going INTO the course, or that they cover in the first two days.<p>Similarly, if I go into the physics topics, they are all <= intro courses, at best. Optics? Doesn't talk about fourier optics, lasers, etc. E&M? Doesn't seem to mention Maxwell's Equations anywhere... enough said. Quantum mech? Nothing. Statistical mech? Nothing.<p>Okay, how about math? Take a look at the differential equations stuff. No higher order, no series methods, no numerical methods, no coupled systems, no non-linear. Probability? No markov chains, MCMC methods, or anything except basic RVs and statistics (which is not the same thing as probability). Same for linear algebra: no fitting methods, no matrix decomposition, no graph theory.<p>I could go on. The point is that they cover the most basic elements of each subject, and they miss a hell of a lot of important subjects. That's okay, but don't claim that they're anywhere close to being able to educate you at a university level.",1366228308

What you need in large-scale single page apps are coping mechanisms for the DOM (or as I know it: the root of all evil). Stuff like automatic and on-demand rendering of content, automatic cleanup and event listener removal, nested layouting solutions, strong eventing and routing mechanisms, data binding and automatic data loading, and so on. Any framework that helps you with those things by necessity will invent its own pseudo-DSL, and require you to live in its world.<p>The way I see it, it's all a matter of what you're optimizing for. If you expect to run at most 2000 lines of code in a single page, then backbone is excellent for that. If you expect to run at least 20.000 lines of code in a single page, then something like ember or ext is needed. You can build those in backbone ofcourse, but you'll probably end up rebuilding much of the infrastructure the bigger frameworks give you out of the box.<p>Ofcourse, this is separate from the whole debate on whether a pure client-side approach makes sense on that scale.

Two-way data binding is pretty magical; if you need it that's probably good, if you don't really need it, it's bad.<p>Comparing vanilla Backbone to Knockout seems a bit odd; they have almost no overlap, and they don't really solve the same problems.  Conversely, if you are using Backbone to solve a Knockout-style problem, it's either not <i>really</i> the sort of problem Knockout is designed for (ie, no need for two-way data binding) or you've added a bunch of magic onto Backbone (either through writing it yourself or using one of the many plugins for Backbone).<p>I just don't think you can use Backbone, solve the sort of problems that Knockout is good for, <i>and</i> have less magic.  Two-way data binding is magic, and it's like...90% of what Knockout does.  Either your stack includes that magic, or you can't compare yourself to Knockout.",1366226441

5566395,comment,5565677,5565677,1,0,condiment,,,"Useful post.  NTILE operations are also useful for evaluating the results of 50/50 tests against revenue or other metrics where your data fits an exponential curve, or where outliers tend to skew the performance of one group incorrectly.  After normalizing your datasets so that each group has identical numbers of users, a graph comparing the distribution of your metrics on a percentile basis can make it trivially easy to visually evaluate the results of a test.<p>As far as using NTILE to find the one metric that matters is concerned, it's a useful tool, but the challenge isn't in structuring and executing SQL queries so much as it is deciding which metrics to focus on and attempt to correlate to user retention.<p>In my experience there can be hundreds of metrics to search through, and correlations between your metrics and user retention are not always obvious at face value, or worse, they might represent a tautological consequence of retention without being the cause of retention (ie, the user has lots of badges because the user is active on the site, but they are not active because of the badges). In these cases, you risk investing valuable development resources optimizing for something that will have no impact on the bottom line, when that time might have been better spent trying to identify novel metrics and getting them into the database for analysis.",1366225707

5566382,comment,5562442,5564665,1,0,ScottBurson,,,"Thanks very much for posting here.<p>I agree that the law needs to be changed.  Instead of the burden of proof being on the examiner to prove obviousness -- which is basically impossible, as it's a subjective judgment -- I believe we should place the burden of proof on the <i>applicant</i> to show <i>objective evidence of nonobviousness</i>.  35 U.S.C.  103 (<a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/103"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/103</a>) needs to be clarified to establish that the burden of proof falls on the applicant (during the application process) or plaintiff (in an infringement proceeding).<p>We already have a pretty good list of some things that could constitute objective evidence of nonobviousness; see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_v._John_Deere_Co"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_v._John_Deere_Co</a>. [the trailing period is part of the URL].  To these we could add publication in a peer-reviewed journal or conference proceeding.<p>I'm not necessarily suggesting that a patent couldn't be granted absent such evidence -- an applicant might reasonably argue that there has not yet been time for her invention to have enjoyed the commercial success that would constitute one kind of evidence.  In any case, a granted patent should be annotated with the evidence provided; if the patent is later litigated, the court should review that evidence and allow additional evidence to be presented.  If the evidence at the time of litigation were still insufficient, however, an infringement suit could not proceed.<p>I think this requirement would not much affect most fields other than software.  For a drug patent, for example, the applicant could simply list all the other molecular structures they tried that didn't have the desired properties.  Most non-software patents have substantial R&D behind them; it would be sufficient to provide evidence of the work that was done.<p>It would make a huge difference in software, though.  Mere novelty would no longer be sufficient.  There would have to be some <i>objective</i> reason to believe that another person, faced with the same problem, would have difficulty coming up with the same solution.<p>I think this proposal addresses all three of your points.  It would obviously increase the burden on applicants and patent holders.  It would reverse the burden of proof on obviousness.  And it would give the examiner -- and then the defendant, if the patent is litigated -- a powerful way to push back against the applicant/plaintiff.",1366225595

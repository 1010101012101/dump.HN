At the moment one of the biggest issues is that there is no way for Gradle to expose extra sourcesets to the IDE, this is a limitation of Gradle and not just the Android plugin I believe, and the tools team want the Gradle build to be the single source of truth. They are working to get that added to Gradle (and they have made a lot of positive changes to Gradle already as they build the new tools), and then things like Robolectric will be able to hook in with the IDE just fine.",1402477131

I am writing a paper on Functional Reactive Programming and Haxl really made me curious. The paper (currently in german, but I&#x27;ll translate it) proposes a new Hypothesis that tries to shred FRP in general, by showing a novel way that solves some of the problems automatically that naturally occur with FRP.<p>I am really interested in seeing how you solve problems for distributed systems with Haxl and how query sharding is handled etc..<p>I&#x27;ve wasted a whole day looking for Haxl online a few weeks ago, just to find out that it wasn&#x27;t released yet.

The Halide code itself is beautiful, but it depends on LLVM which takes forever to build and link, and I ran into some snags with Windows support. I originally wanted to write the whole algorithm in Halide and run it on the GPU, but it turned out that the Halide language isn&#x27;t expressive enough to implement a Hough transform. I had to write that bit in C and I&#x27;m currently only using Halide to do some more straightforward image processing tasks like edge detection filters, blurring, and resampling. It works really well for that though, and performance-wise it runs rings around the naive nested C for loops that I would otherwise have to write.",1402477059

Also, (3) finding a subsequence given a starting and end position should be efficient. If so, we have a efficient mean to transfer data. Just send the index positions. And we can store any data with just those two index positions. Then again, those index numbers are likely to be very very large.

It&#x27;s sad but in situations like this you&#x27;re setting yourself up for long term trouble if you do not actively seek to control things right from day one.<p>I have a couple of cases quite comparable to this one in my immediate surroundings and some of it sounds eerily familiar.<p>The OP is in good company, big corporations fall for things like this and usually it costs a lot more than it did here. Chalk it up to your educational fund.<p>If anybody is in a position to attempt to replicate this experiment you may want to do the following:<p>- incorporate through a lawyers office and if local law requires a resident or national as a director make sure they are accountable<p>- prepare to go there when incorporating and get yourself educated with respect to the local situation (corruption, graft, how foreign companies usually get plucked)<p>- be prepared to spend a lot of time in the target country from the moment that you incorporate<p>- get your ducks in a row, don&#x27;t put the responsibility of doing that in the hands of someone at arms length.<p>- if you want to keep things simple do not create a subsidiary, instead aid someone else in creating a company and hire them for a service they provide. This makes departures so much easier to deal with. It removes all of the responsibility from your end but you keep control at the level of the customer. Not happy? Then deal with someone else.<p>- spread the responsibilities over several people, make sure they check up on each other and report to you.<p>- trust but verify, repeatedly, continuously<p>This is not meant as a &#x27;Philippine people can&#x27;t be trusted&#x27; line, or even a &#x27;foreigners can&#x27;t be trusted&#x27; one.

BeOS BFS, (ReiserFS4) and early versions of NTFS supported extensive object oriented metadata and search capabilities (&quot;Cairo&quot;) - something like WinFS but directly in the filesystem driver. Data could be organized like in relational databases today, you could find your data in various ways. Not just in the old and proven way of hierarchical directory tree.<p>The second you open that up to application layers, you are facing a wide range of problems. Specifically:<p>* Common schema: each application considers itself a unique snowflake, and might want to use different columns to mean different sort of things. We&#x27;ve been here before -semantic web, RDF, etc- and the correct solution was letting the apps just manage their own database of stuff.<p>* Selfish apps: There is nothing stopping apps from overwriting, or manipulating meta-info in ways that are detrimental to user experience. Consider the current case of &quot;Set <x> as default browser&quot;, &quot;Set <x> as default media player&quot; at each launch, then multiply it across every schema column<p>* Interop: Beos attempted to solve this by dumping meta-info into the archives. The problem is, when a file gets outside the original system/OS, these attributes will get truncated. Any workaround on this would require full agreement on changing <i>all of</i> the file transfer protocols, and storage methods on all OS.<p>Also note, that the 90% of the case (localizing files instantly on multi-terabyte consumer-drives) is handled already via Windows Search & Finder. Personal experience on this shows, that you can safely drop the hierarchical madness in favor of filename-based search for most media/music/document cases; and there are ways you can apply this for development as well.",1402474587

No reason not to seed a marketplace site with your own idea of your own creative domains & continue selling your own domains so long as it's profitable. If it fails to become a marketplace, you still have a shot at making your original idea work within it. Almost a free option.",1245326227

I've been wondering how hard it would be to ""create money out of thin air"" by hacking this system. I'm certain that someone has already done this. The best part is that it could be unpunishable, if the money is ""created"" in a country you know that you will never visit again. Morally, it is equivalent to forging money..except perhaps with no damage to the third party that receives the fake money. Practically victimless if you do it on a small scale.<p>Does anyone know any good books or other source of information about international banking and money transfer?<p>I'm thinking that there is a lot of security by obscurity here.",1245325830

Not everyone will see it that way, but that's ok because some will, as long as the website emphasises the creative aspect, searching by topic, etc.  It's like paying a graphics artist to make graphics for your game instead of doing them yourself as they would have done in the old days.<p>But your payment structure makes it difficult.  As much as I can agree it's something worth paying for, I would still want to get it for free if I could.  Like ErrantX I would probably be tempted to just find a name on your site that I liked and use it as inspiration for another name that is still available.",1245324008

663267,comment,662909,662909,0,0,yardie,,,"I've found the Apple laptops to be closer to the actual stated times more than any other manufacturer. But I guess this is more to do with the test suites available (none for Mac). Some manufacturers are notorious (hmmph Acer) for gaming results by reducing screen brightness to 20%, running the proc at the lowest level, disabling Wifi and not much else. Basically letting the laptop sit there until the battery runs out.<p>I called technical support about this because I was getting ~45 minutes even though the box stated 2.5 hours. What I was doing (web browsing over wi-fi, in the late afternoon) would get me the reported time. Seriously, the only way I was going to get 2 hours would be by sitting in the dark with no internet connection using notepad.",1245323744
663266,comment,663196,663196,0,0,patio11,,,"#1: Your pricing is at the worst possible point on the curve.  You charge ten times more than what the inveterate cheapskates want to pay.  You charge ten times less what a <i>middling</i> domain name is worth.  You are opting to do business with a lot of ""pathological clients"" this way -- they will want the moon and stars because you cost TEN TIMES MORE than GoDaddy.  (There will be, inevitably, comments in this thread to that effect.  Do you want to wake up to a mailbox of them every day?)<p>#2: Let's talk inventory.  It will cost you, for the sake of argument, $10 to hold a domain for a year.  That means, to break even, you need to sell one out of every ten you register.  Since you're going to be dealing in 3 word domains primarily, that is going to be a bit of a stretch.  Let's say you branch into bingo for a day and start thinking up domains -- you can count to 500 just by starting with Xbingocards.com and filling in topics for X.  Are you going to be able to unload 50+ of those?<p>#3: You need to do a heck of a lot of manual gruntwork here.  Presumably you'll automate the actual purchasing, but you'll have to think up hundreds or thousands of domains and then sift down to the ones which are actually salable.<p>(If you doubt this, I will give you a list of 500 Xbingocards.com domains and you can time how long it takes you to winnow it down to as narrow a field as you think is winnowable.  My guess is just the filtering would take most SEOs I know upwards of two to four hours to do if they did it systematically.  And then, of the 46 or so you end up with, will you actually be able to sell them?)<p>Do this poorly and you'll be out money.  You'll find that you're eventually spending a lot of money and effort to buy yourself a retail job, if that.",1245323711

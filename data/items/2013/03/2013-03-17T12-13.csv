Here's a great big pile of recent stuff from everyone, a circle, or a community.<p>On the other hand, lets say I want to verify I read every story from certain sources (perhaps the BBC?) exactly, precisely once.  I don't see a way in the G+ UI to ""mark as read"" or ""only display unread"" or whatever.  Might exist or might be a weird way to hack it in, but its not intuitive.<p>For some reason option #1 is semi-popular among news readers, social networking, and old fashioned or online broadcasting, but option #2 is nearly universal among email clients and podcast clients.  You'd never use an email client with a UI of ""here's a random collection of some recent emails"" with no way to tag them as read or deleted.  I'd LOL at the idea of a podcast client with ""here's a random cast that you may or may not have already heard""<p>Another horrible UI fail is time based.  G+ can only do one linear ""newest to oldest"" sort.  Even the dumbest RSS feed readers have some kind of tag/save/star feature.  So you can skim the whole feed, star/save/tag good stuff for later detailed reading.  Then once there is no ""unread"" left, start reading the star/save/tag stories in detail, perhaps much later.  This ""workflow"" is impossible in G+ as near as I can tell.<p>Finally no one using the ""RSS"" workflow uses G+, so you get the chicken and the egg thing, where there's no demand for even the most primitive of workflow management in G+ because anyone wanting anything like that uses RSS.  So the BBC is a bad example in that their social networking people are probably required to use both, but I suspect that 99% of my RSS feeds are not available in G+ because they self segregate by workflow.  You'll need a bigger shock to the system than cancelling goog reader.  I switched to newsblur once the crushing demand let up a bit.  I'm not going to abandon everything I currently enjoy to watch cat videos on G+.",1363525171

5389048,comment,5388219,5388219,6,0,PAULHANNA84,,,"It's really nice to see entrepreneurs caring enough about other entrepreneurs failed endeavors to offer a helping hand. It's common for an entrepreneur to feel alone. We're a rare breed and sometimes hard to understand by others who have never experienced owning a business or building a startup.<p>I myself have started and owned 4 different businesses in the last 10 years, from the age of 18 to now being 28. Each lasting anywhere from 2-3 years, 2 of which I failed, the 3rd which I sold and the 4th which I still currently own.<p>Every failed endeavor was a pierce in the heart and a devastating experience. Every failed endeavor required some downtime in order to evaluate what went wrong and in order to rebuilding my confidence. Through it all I can now boast in my failures. They've refined my ego, they've turned reckless ambition into fine tuned ambition. I've learned more from my failures than I have learned from my successes.<p>I feel that I now carry a protective shield containing knowledge and experience which help me through not just my business endeavors but as well as my life endeavors. Our Ego's play a big role in how we feel/react when things go right or wrong. It's common that an entrepreneur wants to project success at all times, and there is nothing wrong with that, you should, but it's the way you project it that could be faulty. It's common to see entrepreneurs ""fake it until they make it"". I also see some entrepreneurs  personalities made up of a mix of condescending demeanor's and know it all attitudes. You don't have to always be right. You should always be humble enough to accept critique, to constantly learn. Your happiness should be based on the fact that you are constantly learning and conducting, not how far away you are from a multi-million dollar exit or your companies profitability. Don't get me wrong, that is the main purpose of your companies existence, but it shouldn't be yours. Obviously a company is in the business of making money and should conduct its decision making based on those goals but the best businesses/products/services created are from those who are genuinely interested in what they're building. Money cannot buy passion, but passion can buy money.<p>Don't let anger be the motive. You're not out to prove others wrong, you're not up against the world. It's easy for entrepreneurs to end up with a chip on their shoulder as being an entrepreneur is being a part of a rare breed that is not always understood well by others. The more you share your ideas with individuals who don't understand business, the more you open doors to the non-believers, who then are perceived as ""haters"". This all ends up being a waste of time and energy. The less refined your ego is, the more devastating the hit will be. Stay humble, stay modest and work like no other. Your work should come effortlessly. Office hours should feel like gaming hours. It's fun...all of it. The obstacles, the profits, the challenges, the levels...it's all a game. If your time spent doesn't feel anything close to that then perhaps you should reevaluate what it is that you're doing and why. Being an entrepreneur is a lifestyle, if it's not your style, then it's not your style. Regardless of the potential money made you'll never be happy if it's a life you're not interested in living and happiness should be the ultimate goal above all else.<p>-Paul Hanna",1363524845

But yeah we're asking the inhabitants of Cyprus for a sacrifice too. The 10% tax is a very crude way to implement this, but dire times need dire actions.</i><p>I don't think it's hyperbole to suggest that this sort of action could lead to pan-european war in the next decade.<p>It radically undermines trust in the banking system, in the social contract, and in democratic government. If you undermine the social contract and rule by fiat, as the EU has in Greece and Cyprus, it leads to extremism, break down of social order, an ever more polarised political situation, and ultimately revolution and/or dictatorship (see France late 1780s, Russia 1900-1917, Germany 1920-30s). That's not a Europe I want to see and this can happen quite quickly even in an apparently stable society when the foundations are weakened progressively.<p>The EU was founded to avoid precisely this sort of escalation of conflict and blaming of others by sharing the wealth of nations and promoting ever closer union. They could easily afford to support Cyprus through these hard times against the banks, in fact they're a big enough trading block to simply default wholesale against their creditors and start again, but they have chosen instead the road of muddy compromise, where they end up defaulting piecemeal (as in Greece, which effectively defaulted), but by stealth and in secret and with draconian conditions attached, and which hurts the poorer people of the EU disproportionately by forcing through massive cuts which <i>don't actually solve the problem</i>. Is Greece doing better than Iceland at the moment, is the austerity working? How will paying this bill help Cyprus?<p>They're undermining trust in the entire EU and EUR project, and there may come a time when governments are overthrown and countries leave the union because of it, and even (and I sincerely hope not) where countries go to war over it. It's fascinating and a little sad to see the same mistakes being made all over again.",1363524311

Much as browsers recently started downloading and displaying ""favicons"" (well, maybe not so recently, I'm an old timer), there is no reason a browser can't download the RSS feed from a site and compare the date of the most recent update to the latest date in the browsers history log.  In other words if there's something new, its ""bold"" in my bookmarks and if not, its regular.<p>Now this is opt-in spamable, if you're running a journalist site or ecommerce, of course you doctor your sites feed to always appear new in someone's bookmarks even if its the same old recycled garbage.  But there's more to the 'net than online stores and tabloid journalism.<p>Another novel user experience would be the trend of turning the ""address/URL bar"" into a search gateway bar.  I think it fairly logical that if I use the ""search"" bar it should search and prioritize results from RSS feeds I subscribe to, below my own bookmarks and above generic web search results (aka google)<p>I don't think RSS is very interesting as ""content"" or an ""app"" but it could be pretty useful as metainformation.",1363524223

So, bidding 33 on each turn is sufficient to win. That definitely is doable with at most 5 turns that you win for a total cost of 165.<p>However, the second square isn't worth as much to the one who already won the first, as it leaks information about his strategy. If you won the first, it may be better to let the other player win the second, draining his resources, allowing you to get the other squares you need cheaper.<p>Because of that, it may be possible to get the maximum down from that 165 (my intuition says you can, but I am too lazy to do the calculations now)",1363523175

Over 6000 years of recorded history, which has the better record, paper money or gold?<p>There have been limited areas and limited times where even gold has been temporarily worthless.  The Venn diagram of those times/places has always been within a much larger time/place where paper money has also been useless.<p>This smacks of digital archiving arguments.  No consumer level digital media format has ever been popular for more than a couple decades, therefore some will tell you that any digital storage is literally useless.  Folks who know what they're doing just replicate/transfer into the new format every couple years.  You need to do that with your fiat currency.  Right now a bank account in Cyprus is looking like a pretty stupid idea.  I am sure we'll be able to bracket that with times in the past / future where gold was a dumb idea... it just won't be today.  Minimization of transaction/conversion cost is crucial.<p>Gold has some pretty serious storage costs that shouldn't be overlooked.

Sometimes similar things in business come from random convergent individual evolution, but more often from the outside.

You may remember a similar fad a decade earlier for citrus oils.<p>Generalized, generic version of what they'll do on an individual case basis with numerical metrics in private sector.  Talk to buddies in the field to get raw randomized data and turn the data into a report from a business perspective if you pay $x bounty for finding a security bug that results in a supply demand curve shaped exactly as such, with this effect on product development times, and this effect on total cost of production / ownership, sales figures, etc, all theoretically ""industry wide"" or at least ""subindustry wide""<p>We don't have a free market system, more of a centrally controlled system.

Someone out there is probably researching every law/rule/reg out there... costs of obeying vs disobeying, cost to purchase alternative legislation via election funds / lobbying, and repeat each along the short term / long term axis.<p>For accounting the rules are often ""what rule can you purchase"" or ""what you can get away with"" but there's also real world accounting.  You need to keep two sets of books, one with how fast does the IRS allow you to depreciate ""XYZ"" for tax purposes, and another set of books for how fast ""XYZ"" actually depreciates in the real world.  Then you have to live off the real world books or else you can get in a horrible cash crunch if your cashflow depends on selling a used ""XYZ"" to make payroll this month or as a downpayment on a new ""XYZ"".<p>Finally criminals spend a lot of time inventing new crimes.

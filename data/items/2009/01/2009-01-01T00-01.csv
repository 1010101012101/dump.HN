Fast loading sites also have a larger bounce rates than slower loading sites. I have no idea why that is but the data was conclusive. So maybe fast loading sites are great for transactions (shopping etc) where the speed is important but maybe not so when you're loading someone's profile. My best guess is that by waiting, people are investing time into a page and they want to check it before they hit that back button. (ping me if you want the source and I'll dig it out).",1230771319

416088,comment,414330,415873,0,0,mmmurf,,,"Fair enough.  On a slightly tangential note, I think that the idea of ""uprooting from homes"" is a bit of an unfortunate cliche.  In reality, it is home ownership that shackles people to jobs they hate, etc.  If you rent, you can move whenever you want.  If you own a home, you can't move if the job market declines or you find a better offer elsewhere unless you hire a Realtor and go through a major home sale project... and if the local economy is in decline, you're probably not the only person trying to sell your house and so you may end up selling it at a big loss (as was the case in post-industrial Flint, Michigan).<p>I realize that landlords have been vilified in the past, but who is really benefited by suppressing the mobility of the population?  It's businesses (whose workers can't leave), it's politicians (who don't have to worry as much about people packing up and leaving in response to bad policies, corruption, etc.), and it's banks -- most people pay at least the value of their home in mortgage interest, and are effectively enslaved to the bank, an unrelenting landlord who can inflict the equivalent of modern-day debtors prison in the form of foreclosure credit destruction and confiscation of any equity earned since purchase.<p>How many people are tremendously afraid of losing their job because they might lose their house (their biggest investment)?  How many people put up with unfulfilling, soul-sucking work just to make that house payment?<p>Consider how this has all changed -- how many more debt slaves were created -- when the housing market tanked.  Home ownership is not the American dream, nor is being part of a community for the long term, nor is having the same job for 30 years and then retiring with a gold watch and a pension.<p>True freedom is in being able to take a better offer and being able to reinvent one's self whenever one wants.  But our entire financial system, it seems, was based on the idea of encouraging long-term debt (mortgages) and the stasis that accompanies it.<p>So I think the ideal that you are striving for with not uprooting people from their rental apartments is not only illusory but destructive.  Price changes contain information, and preventing price changes simply hides information, keeps people in the dark, etc.<p>Maybe being uprooted will (metaphorically) allow the plant to catch flight and land somewhere better... Maybe rental real-estate prices are so high because tons of rich people are moving in and they all plan on sending their kids to private school, leading to the destruction of the public schools -- this is the case in SF where most people with money would never send their kids to SF public schools even though it costs $2K/month to rent a dumpy 1BR apartment and so objectively it's a ""rich"" area.",1230771128

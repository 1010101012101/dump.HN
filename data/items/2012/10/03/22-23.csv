Now that the security & benefits are no longer assured, you see more mid- to upper-mid level workers willing to take more chances and start their own companies.<p>By no means should you confuse this as being any sort of sea change - the first post is still completely accurate for the majority of young workers, especially - but I think more people are starting to recognize ""freelancer"" & ""self-employed"" as something different from ""freeter"" - a Japanese term that ostensibly means ""free + worker"" but is really seen as just some young bum who bounces from one part-time job to another.",1349305189

You're right that a lot of the reason we spend time on login is because we want our users' accounts to be secure - but a big advantage of our API is that we extend all that work to third parties.  I think it is actually a pretty good drop-in login solution, but you obviously have to have some setup associated with it (the user needs to understand to whom they're disclosing their identity, etc).  You don't need to ask for any permissions or query any data (though of course I think you can make things a lot more compelling if you do in a lot of cases).<p>Agreed that companies should determine how to deliver a great experience.  In my opinion, a two-click login with something like FB is a <i>much better</i> experience than registering with another password and confirming your email address, and worrying about what the site's security is like (how do you evaluate this?).

The ""common case"" makes sense when you are dealing with a discrete variable that has a mode (a single highly common value): it does not make as much sense for a continuous one like hand span.<p>Put simply, the issue is that no one actually has the ""common case"": the probability that someone's hand span exactly matches the ""average"" or ""mean"" of the distribution is approximately 0.<p>Instead, we have to first discretize the variable into a histogram and then assign a common case afterwards. The way you normally might do that is with standard deviations. However, now you have to ask ""what is the variance"".<p>With hand size, it is quite obviously very large: again, my girlfriend's hand is to an iPhone 4 as my hand is to a Galaxy Note, and people generally do not go around calling either of us freaks of nature with regards to our hands (I actually have fairly effeminate hands ;P).<p>I will therefore repeat with emphasis: the idea that people make these reachability arguments as if hand size is universal <i>down to silly half-inch increments</i> is downright insane. However, I will now show some data.<p><a href=""http://www.steinbuhler.com/assets/images/HandSizeChartNewWeb.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.steinbuhler.com/assets/images/HandSizeChartNewWeb...</a><p>This chart comes from a piano company measuring hand span for purposes of optimal piano sizing (concentrating on people whose hands have already finished growing). (Their conclusion, btw, was that they needed to sell a few more piano sizes.)<p>Now, this is full hand span; however, as your hand is fixed in the middle by the thing you are holding, you won't get this full spread, but I would easily argue that you will get at least half of this spread in that case.<p>The result, as you can see, is that there is a very very large range of reasonable values: hands are really not that common; you might think you have a common hand, but you really don't: hand span varies by numerous inches.<p>(There are multiple factors for this, of course: it isn't just hand size; you also have to take into account flexibility of joints, muscle strength, etc.; even if everyone's hands were the same size, the ability to reach the upper-corner of a device would vary a lot.)<p>I will then argue that even if you want to just attack a lot of people, and still fail for numerous others, you need to at least be making a device for women and a device for men: the difference between genders is really striking in that chart.<p>However, most people don't argue things like this: they accept that there are massive variations in the size of peoples' feet, hands, torsos, and pretty much every other body part, and this is why we don't just sell one-size-fits-all clothing.<p>Apple, FWIW, would not only be selling a single size of jeans, they would claim that they had optimized the size of the jeans to fit some optimal size, and their user community would then defend them with diagrams that show variances of less than half an inch for how perfect the fit is.",1349303327

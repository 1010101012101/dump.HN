For example, folks with $250,000 to $300,000 a year in income will pay 10.3%, up from 9.3%. The new top income tax ratefor folks with income of $1 million-pluswill be 13.3%, up from a current top rate of 10.3%. That eclipses New Yorkers combined state and local top rate of 12.7% and Hawaiis top rate of 11%. The income tax hikes are retroactive to Jan. 1, 2012, but the extra bill isnt due until April 15, 2013. (See below for a photo gallery of the highest state and local income taxes on a $1 million income post election.)<p>Still, all Californians will be chipping in: Proposition 30 also raises the state sales tax from 7.25% to 7.5% for four years, starting Jan. 1, 2013.""[1]<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2012/11/08/california-voters-sock-it-to-the-rich-and-the-fate-of-other-state-tax-ballot-measures/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2012/11/08/califor...</a>",1364248784

I feel the same way. I think that ""feminism"" like this - where a girl and her mom show how she's better than her stupid older brothers - is divisive, plays on peoples' emotions, and really makes things worse for all of us. It's not pushing equality, it's responding to ""boys are better"" with ""no, <i>girls</i> are better."" Yet if I were to say this openly, I'd be called a misogynist.",1364248724
5439986,comment,5439751,5439872,1,0,ryanatkn,,,"Thanks for the feedback!<p>Yes, that's correct, but everything is relative. The recommended daily intake is the recommended nutrient amount divided by 2000 calories, and this value is then compared against every other food. The bars for each nutrient are calculated according to the formula ((nutrient/calorie)/maxValue), where maxValue is the highest (nutrient/calorie) in the comparison set, and the result is a percentage of the maxValue, and is the percentage the bar is filled. So it's all relative - the highest value will always be a full bar. If something has half as much per calorie, the bar will be half-full. On the nutrients page, there is no daily value that's being compared against - it's just foods against each other.<p>Measuring something per-serving isn't something that you can glean from the data as presented. For amaranth, if you compare it to the recommended daily intake, you'll see a full bar for amaranth and just a sliver for the recommended daily intake, meaning 2000 calories of amaranth would have way more calcium than you need. More usefully, the app can show you how amaranth compares against other foods to help you make choices. I'll think about how per-serving data could be included - thanks!",1364248714

5439972,comment,5437834,5438753,7,0,overgryphon,,,"I am a woman, and I work in software development, so I'm assuming I fit in your group called ""women in tech"". I have no idea what insults, abuse, threats, contempt, ridicule, disdain, and disregard I apparently have been routinely facing.<p>If ""women in tech"" did suffer so severely on a daily basis, it would not be relevant to Richards. Her job description seems to be ""Developer Evangelist"". I'm not sure what that specifically means, but I do know it isn't technical, and thus she isn't a ""woman in tech"".<p>Even if you do consider her a ""woman in tech"", the abuse Richards suffered while wrong is not something routinely faced by ""women in tech"". I understand that genitalia aren't generally supposed to be discussed at professional conferences, but am finding it very hard to see why this is an issue of harassment towards ""women in tech"" when no women were in the conversation at all. Since Richards felt it was, she was entitled to follow up with the conference leaders, and ask that they handle the situation appropriately, which she did. At this point in time, she could have enjoyed the rest of PyCon and gone home without suffering any abuse at all, happy that she spoke up about the conversation that she took offense to.<p>Instead she publicly posted the photos of the men who dared discuss genitalia amongst themselves in her presence in order to shame them. This is when she opened her self to (and received) abuse. She had already had the situation handled by the conference organizers, and thus had already spoken up about it without any abuse at all.<p>It is unfortunate that Richards received the huge storms of abuse that she did. But she chose to handle the situation in a way that invited that abuse, when there were clear ways to ""speak up"" that would not have resulted in such abuse.<p>This has everything to do with reacting to situations in a professional manner, and nothing to do with ""women in tech"" being able to speak up about legitimate sexual harassment.",1364248537
5439971,comment,5421255,5438649,1,0,georgeorwell,,,"Hey man, thanks for your reply.<p>From above:<p>> Context.  You are supposed to comment on HN. You are not supposed to play in the street. If you played in a park, I'd expect you not to get hit by a car. If someone does get hit by a car while playing in a park, you don't suggest to that person they should avoid playing in the park.<p>What can I say, I just genuinely don't understand why this isn't a straw man.  Part of this has to do with me not being the sharpest knife in the block.  Of course, if someone just randomly posted a comment here and received one death threat for doing so, I wouldn't say that they shouldn't post anymore.  Isn't that the closest interpretation of your analogy?  I'm serious.<p>The reason I think the analogy doesn't fit is due to a few differences.  First, the person in question has a history of writing fairly inflammatory comments, based on my personal reaction, based on the comments containing curse words, sarcasm, insults, and all-caps (more recently), and finally based on the comments receiving downvotes.  The second difference is that it's not one death threat, but multiple death threats that were alleged.  The third difference is that I didn't say don't post at all, I just said don't post in such an inflammatory way.  Given these three fairly significant differences, I concluded that your argument was a straw man.  I could be wrong about that, but you'll have to convince me.<p>I now believe she was referring to Adria and not herself, so I'm really just interested in understanding whether or not the claim of it being a straw man is correct.  I mean, I don't want to accuse other people of throwing up straw men if I'm just making a fool of myself.  And you're right, although I've known about logic for a while, it's only recently that I started taking it more seriously in the context of discussions.  I linked to Wikipedia because I thought you didn't know what a straw man was, I apologize for the insult.<p>Whether or not I'm trolling, I don't know what to say.  It strikes me that a lot of people who troll don't even realize that this is what they're doing, so maybe I am, I don't know.  It's not conscious, if so.  Apologies in advance?",1364248528

Seems to me that the browser vendors should get together and come up with a better solution for browsers to store and manage auth tokens.<p>Right now it is done piecemeal by websites, but is confusing to end users. Having a direct, first-class API and UI in the browser that can show the user exactly what third party sites they are ""logged into"" and have a ""Logout/Deauthorize"" button next to them would be worthwhile, and have less of a chance of ""breaking the web"", or imposing workarounds that might hurt user experience.<p>BTW, how does Firefox treat a CORS XHR response?

I've seen that's become increasingly common that job offers include options as prices instead of percentages. Eg you'll get $500,000 in stock based on the last round valuation as opposed to saying 0.5%. This is increasingly common in later stage companies and it seems to be very effective. Now companies in early stage with high valuations can do the same.",1364247980

Both sides of the spectrum from a team perspective.<p>I think one thing the military does really well is critique. Nothing you ever do is perfect. There's always something someone will find for you to do better next time,even if it's the best piece of tactics anyone has ever seen. This is particularly for team leaders.<p>People see the yelling and screaming of bootcamp and figure that's just the way life in the army is. It isn't. These are shock courses specifically designed for stress purposes. Real learning takes place calmly and with a more cooperative technique, particularly when training leaders, but also when learning more advanced weapon systems and/or techniques, and almost always when discussing tactics.<p>Thinking back now, there are many periods for peer-review (never lower than peer), but in these instances are almost always done in collaborative training sessions, where it is recognized that people are going to make mistakes and that everyone will receive both positive and negative feedback. One thing I realize is that while they are teaching a future leader on receiving critique, they are also teaching future leaders on how to critique. In the army it's very similar to a post game report of a sports team. I've not seen too much of that in a boardroom... everyone looks to deflect blame instead of improve the team performance.<p>Your personal performance reviews - where it counts - are always done privately, usually over a set discussion between you and your direct superiors. Publicly shaming a leader in front of junior troops is pretty much forbidden. Regardless of how much of a fuck-up a person may be, you can't have his troops thinking that he's not worth listening too.",1364247847

Of those, <i>2</i> had actually done some legwork on their own - one had attended a tradeshow showing nothing more than a powerpoint and had collected some leads. (initially, that was impressive).  Another had done a lot of exploratory work, and when I asked them to do XYZ, they actually did it and gave me the results from it.<p>In both cases, I've extended a bit more of my time to work with these people in hopes of getting the project to a point where we might work together long term.  In one case, we simply parted ways because the vision was shifting a lot on his end - no focus.  In the other case, that team has actually called it quits - they had simply underestimated the time and effort involved in making it work, and I appreciated the halt vs dragging it on for months on end.<p>But <i>rarely</i> do I meet groups or people that have done any significant legwork at all - they're the typical ""idea man/woman"", and just need someone to ""make it work"".",1364247492

5439851,comment,5437834,5437834,2,0,cwgem,,,"I notice a few comments scattered about various parts of this thread so I'll try and address as much as possible here.<p>There seems to be confusion regarding the idea of a program to support female python developers. Why female developers? Why not male ones too? This is what is causing the confusion that there's some sort of discrimination happening. However that's not really the case, and you have to look at the whole picture to really see it.<p>So, there's a problem of equality in the workplace as a general philosophy. Sexism, Ageism, Racism, you name it. Taking from a Japanese proverb ""He who runs after two hares will catch neither"". In this case there's more than two hares, there's quite a lot in fact. So we have to break the problem down into manageable components. In this case someone decided to take the women in tech approach to the problem and focus on it. I'd consider it like taking someone with knowledge of databases and let them work on the database specific problems.<p>Now then, what exactly is the issue with women in the IT field? Up until the hiring chain and through the workplace experience, there are points to where women don't get the chance they should get. One reason is that people may not see engineering as a ""female appropriate job"", as though women should be working as secretaries or fashion designers. Another problem is fear. There is fear that going into a job a woman might get harassed or otherwise have difficulty fitting into a primarily male dominated environment. Start-ups for example often have laid back environments where the line between professional an personal gets somewhat fuzzy. Someone slips and lets out an inappropriate comment because they're having a conversation with another coworker which resembles a talk at a party, and are unaware that they're still in a professional environment. This becomes difficult.<p>So you have women who are trying to get their foot in the door, but are not sure how. That's why we need groups like this. First off we need people to show support. We need people to say ""hey women in IT is possible, here's some of us that are doing it"". We also need men in on this too so they can be educated on what women in IT may have to deal with and know what to avoid. They're also needed to show that not all guys have this thing against women in IT and that things can work out for the better.  Finally we also need it so that women can do networking with companies that are more aware of the issues that women deal with in the workplace, and actively work to figure out how to deal with it.<p>This is why these sort of organizations need to be in place, and why they need to target women specifically. They need to see others like them working towards the same goal so they can achieve their dreams knowing they have support.<p>Now with that in mind there is point to watch out for, and what I believe is a valid concern. That is that we don't want the women in IT movement to become a ""women are better than men"" deal, we want it to become a ""women should have the same opportunities as men"". Equality is our main goal here. However, because of the environment I've mentioned above, we need groups that specifically target women to help the transition towards a more equality friendly environment.<p>Hope this gives a better sense of what's happening.",1364247289

It's serving a type of use case, for sure. Just not one suited for all web applications.<p>If you're a pre-product-market-fit startup, trying to validate a concept, pedastal isn't for you. But, if you're square, or linkedin, or [insert successful startup here] and you're going to introduce a new service into your existing infrastructure, yea, it should be performant, and then maybe pedastal and the mental model that backs it makes sense.<p>But for an early stage startup, you're not likely to have to solve many of these problems, especially the scaling ones. And doing SOA from the get-go is <i></i>orders of magnitude<i></i> more complex than the standard monolithic application. You won't reap any of the benefits from SOA until you have the requirement for some form of scale -- either team scale or product performance scale. The more likely case for an early-stage startup taking the approach pedastal is ""peddling"" (forgive me, I had to) is that your application architecture will be significantly more complex, making it harder to work on, grow, and hire for.<p>The stuff pedastal is trying to do is for grown-ups, and grown up applications. And in this metaphor, early-stage startups are teenagers.<p>How this looks to me is that relevance has a specific perspective on how to build services. I'd guess that perspective is highly informed on the types of clients they work with. Given the mental model of pedastal, I'd also venture to guess that they don't do much work with early-stage startups.

The reason obviously being that a large monopoly has no competing entity to force it to modify its behavior.<p>While it is true that Google tries to ""clean-up"" their search I think this is almost an arrogant stance.  How can a few hundred people be in charge of deciding what you and I should and should not see?  Methinks we should be given control.  If I don't like weapons of any kind I ought to be able to go to my control panel and exclude them from my results.  It should be my choice, not theirs.<p>That said, these ""assisted opening"" blades are an obvious example of exploiting a loophole in the laws.  For all intents and purposes they are switch blades.  The end result is exactly the same: Open a knife very quickly.<p>Then there's the whole argument about how much sense it makes to granularly ban stuff like this.  I have no clue as to how much crime out there can be attributed directly to switch blades.  Probably not much at all.  Although I do remember that knives are on par with certain types of guns in terms of murders per year.<p>Circling back, the ""Google Syndrome"" is one that is constantly growing in threat level.  I've said this many time.  I like their services, but this business of killing your account auto-magically with no real business process in place to deal with the problems is just total bullshit.  At one point it has to stop.  I have no clue what's going to make that happen, but it sure seems to be leaving a path of destruction behind it.<p>The best thing we can do is stop using every new Google service they throw at us.

Accounts remain active.""</i> the implication is that total ad spend vs banned ad ratio prevails. That would suggest that the knife guys could start advertising flowers, buy 90% of their AdWords for their buddy the florist and only 10% of their AdWords for their knives and be Okay. I don't think it would work out.<p>Google is just acting poorly here, why doesn't matter. As the original poster points out, 'assisted open' knives are legal for sale in the US (even in California which is kind of picky about such things). They aren't part of the terms of service explicitly, so either they are or they aren't. And if they are, they are for everybody, and if they aren't they are aren't for everybody.<p>I'm sure if .01% of WalMart's ad spend was for Canadian pharmaceuticals that they would be shut down in a heartbeat (because the Government really came down hard on Google for that).<p>Its common knowledge that one of the ways larger successful sellers on Ebay harass smaller sellers is by reporting them for various rules violations. When a ""Power Seller"" has a dedicates account manager inside Ebay they don't have to put up with random reports like the small guy who randomly gets someone in the problem reporting staff. That asymmetry is exploited to mitigate small seller effectiveness.

(Which is the only reason you actually use a proxy measure for in the first place.)<p>In this case, the proxy fails at the first test (sound rationale for using it as a proxy for expressiveness), which makes the second test (do the results line up with what you'd expect on a known sample set) meaningless.",1364246082

Removing players from the market cannot possibly serve Google's financial interest, and that conspiratorial angle makes absolutely no sense.<p>Because their seems to be some confusion about how bid systems work (including by the dead post below), if Amazon and others outbid this company, netting more for Google, this would be a non-issue because you would have never seen this company's products.<p>It is notable that Google absolutely bans knives in the context of weapons, full stop (the author of the linked posting seems confused and thinks ""such as"" gives the specific culprits, when those are merely examples). This company may have authored their ads in a weapons manner, or targeted weapons-type keywords -- the sort of nonsense that gets Google sued by a bunch of state Attorneys down the road, everyone clucking about how evil Google is selling (indirectly) the knife that the kid used to do some evil.<p>EDIT: The only possible favoritism that Google might be showing her is in the context of legal responsibility. If some random knife site sells a kid a knife via a Adwords ad, everyone will come gunning for Google. If Walmart sells a knife to some kid, everyone will go gunning for Walmart, regardless of how they got the initial contact.",1364246050

Less of the ""if you can't code you don't have valuable skills"" attitude. I have a blog post sitting in draft form that has scarily similar advice to this based on my own experiences, however this describes it with some really inspiring YC examples.<p>I started working this way at the start of 2012 and all of my projects since then have been far more popular/successful and more pleasing to work on. This is because I'm fully in control of project progress, I can see things through to launch, pushing the limits of my coding skills and bringing my 'concierge' MVP to life.<p>For those looking for technical help with a project longer term, don't forget that by starting this way you're stripping back and leaving pure technical issues which allows those with technical skills to clearly see where they could bring value which makes offering help very interesting.",1364245453

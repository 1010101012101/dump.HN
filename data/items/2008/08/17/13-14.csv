278357,comment,278120,278158,0,0,theantidote,,,"You aren't being that facetious. My father was a restaurant manager in the 70s and he had to catalogue every record he had, how many times each song was played, and then cut a check to the appropriate record companies to avoid getting sued by them. This wasn't a chain restaurant or anything either, just a small little one. They are really assholes about playing your own music, luckily you are allowed to play internet, terrestrial, and satellite radio for free (they have yet to impose a fee on that I guess) and Pandora counts as internet radio so it makes a great solution for businesses.<p>Actually now that I think of it, Pandora should offer a business or premium plan. Because businesses have to display the name of the song/artist playing when they play the radio, Pandora should offer a simple, ad-free song title display that businesses can use when playing their songs. There's some revenue! Yay! Stay in existence please!",1218980976

I'm not saying the CA business model is good; I'm saying that it's silly to say you can run SSL without CAs.",1218980789

Learn to use Vim or Emacs, then spend a year doing serious development in something like Ruby instead of C# or Java, and do it in a Unix-like user environment.</i><p>So does the author suggest anyone working with Java or C# should quit their job?<p>Or does working with vim also provide you with an alternate space-time continuum which allows you to ""just"" spend one year doing doing something else entirely without it affecting the world around you and the requirements that you have a <i>job</i> which needs to  get done?",1218979988
278348,story,,,8,38,CatDancer,"Startup idea for you: A button to make websites readable",,"The world is full of unreadable websites: sites that have poor contrast such as dark gray text on a light gray background; sites that have tiny fonts; sites that obscure their content in a sea of advertising and widgets, sites that block their content with popup advertising...<p>These unreadable websites are especially painful for older people to deal with, since often their eyesight isn't as good as it used to be, and not being as tech savvy they are more easily confused by clutter and distractions.  But the older demographic isn't a bad one for startups to target though, since one thing older people do have is money.<p>This startup idea is simple: create a bookmarklet (see, for example, http://www.google.com/bookmarks or http://ycombinator.com/bookmarklet.html) labeled ""Readable"".  When the user gets to an unreadable page, they click on your ""Readable"" button in their bookmarks toolbar, and your site renders for them a readable version of the page that they're on.<p>You can include a small, tasteful header at the top of the page which includes a ""Nope, not good!"" button which gives you immediate feedback on which pages you are messing up when you try to render them in a readable fashion.<p>The core algorithm could be pretty simple: scan the page for the larger blocks of natural language text and display that.  You don't have to be perfect, since if you miss anything of importance on the page the user can always click the ""back"" button to return to the original.",1218979941

But that's really not our problem, is it? If WMG (or their trade reps) are a bunch of bitches, Pandora should just do business with Matador.<p>It feels like what Pandora really wants is for their business model to be handed to them on a platter.",1218979841

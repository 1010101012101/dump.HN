7728362,comment,7726828,7728097,3,0,saraid216,,,"> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m reading this correctly, but this seems like a strange false dilemma.<p>The conversation is more complicated than you realize.<p>At level 1, there exist many parents who, for whatever reason, purchase gadgets for their kids as a means of distraction. Video games, cell phones, etc. This is generally a result of poor decision-making and life circumstance. (Mother died and dad is trying to pick up the slack; hospital bills crippled their finances and they&#x27;re exhausted after coming home from their third job; work is more important, they weren&#x27;t really interested in having kids anyways; etc.) Really, this should be level 0, but the exact reason isn&#x27;t relevant.<p>At level 2 is people like ausjke, who look at this and see a lot of kids who are utterly absorbed and addicted. They respond to this by swinging the pendulum as far as possible to the other side. Don&#x27;t be like those kids; they make their parents look bad. To an extent, they have a point: LED screens <i>are</i> very captivating, no matter what&#x27;s playing on them. But at the end of the day, it&#x27;s an overreaction.<p>At level 3, you have angersock, who can see as far down as level 1 and blames the parents. They&#x27;re not wrong, per se, because the issue at hand is at level 2. If parents paid more attention, then the kids would play in moderation rather than excessively. It tends to be unheard because people at level 2, like ausjke, are pretty self-righteous about how they themselves have parented or were parented.<p>But as ausjke says, there is a surprisingly good analogy here in drugs. That is, the problem with drugs has <i>nothing to do with drugs</i> and everything to do with societal demonization, power struggles between classes, poor legislation, and economic consequences. He says we ought to blame the drug dealers, but he never asks where they get the drugs and more importantly why they bother at all.<p>It&#x27;s a conversation that&#x27;s been tread over and over and over again. It&#x27;s not a false dilemma; it&#x27;s a call-and-response routine.",1399805732

On the other hand, I think that <i>The compiler is always right</i> is a rather good general guideline for programming.<p>There are three models of programming [1] involved in programming, the one in the head of the programmer, the language specification and the one in the compiler. To look at them individually, it would be nice if the first one is right but of course it is pretty much by definition wrong. (Until we finally have the tools to program via telepathic link.) The second is the language, which should be the authoritative one. And the one in the compiler, which for pragmatic reasons wins.

For creative groups such as drug discovery teams or for traders at financial institutions, say, the other overwhelming factor determining success was: do they also talk to a lot of people outside their group? &quot;What we call &#x27;engagement&#x27; and &#x27;exploration&#x27; appeared to be about 40% of the explanation of the difference between a low-performing group and a high-performing group across all the studies,&quot; Pentland says.<p>> It was important that a good deal of engagement happened outside formal meetings. From this data, Pentland extrapolates a series of observations on everything from patterns of home-working (not generally a good idea) to office design (open and collegiate) to leadership. &quot;If you create a highly energetic environment where people want to talk to each other right across the organisation then you have pretty much done your job right there.&quot;<p>So true.",1399805057

The kids I have coming through seem to have done better things after being introduced via something like Scratch (or Gamemaker) where there isn&#x27;t a break between what they code and how they get it to work. ie for Mindstorms you need to physically build something that is capable of doing the job that your program requires. A surprising number of students either didn&#x27;t have the interest in that aspect or were unable to build what they had in mind.<p>(Also the Mindstorms software is awful.)",1399803846

At the Pureplay rate of $0.0021 per play, he&#x27;d receive $4971 for the same number of plays as his song being played just a single time on the top radio station in every US market.

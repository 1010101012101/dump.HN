3288441,comment,3284921,3285970,1,0,Someone,,,"Yes, it truly is annoying that, in Windows, one cannot use a few page up presses to quickly look up say a function name, then hit, say, cursor right to automatically scroll back at the point one was at :-)<p>The rationale for choosing this behavior in the Macintosh human interface guidelines was one of consistency: the keys simulate clicking the page up area, and clicking there does not move the cursor.<p>The keys _had_ to emulate mouse behavior because not all users had page up/down keys. The original Mac keyboard did not even have cursor keys.<p>I also think Apple that way avoided the difficult choice of what to do with the cursor. Should it stay at the same screen position, move to the top of the window, or something else? What if scrolling hits the top/bottom of the document? What if one hits page up while already scrolled upwards as far as possible? Should the cursor move within the document?<p>Finally, there is consistency with other programs. Drawing programs, photoshop, file explorers, etc, typically do not move the selection on page up/down.<p>I think they made the best choice for that time. It may no longer be the best choice in today's world where six year olds have six years of experience working with GUIs, but the eighties were quite different.",1322528377

Suddenly things you used to do in person, with reasonable expectations and no practical way for commercial entities to override those expections, have been replaced by doing everything in software and on-line, with EULAs and click-through agreements that contain numerous obviously abusive terms that are not necessary for the performance of the basic agreement, would be unexpected by the individual agreeing to the standard form contract, but are never known (until it's too late) because <i>no-one</i> actually reads the full details of every form agreement they ""agree"" to.<p>It is well past time that consumer protection laws were updated to dramatically rebalance the legal weight of form contracts containing potentially unexpected or misunderstood terms against what would seem necessary and reasonable to the person entering into such an agreement.<p>It is also well past time that privacy laws were updated to reflect the Internet/database/data-mining age.

However, any time I buy a book from Amazon I first check if a DRM-free alternative is available elsewhere.  I don't do this because of principled opposition to DRM (I am opposed to DRM on principle, but it's not why I do this); I do it because I want my books to be as portable as possible, not locked in to any one merchant, platform, or device.  Unfortunately, in most cases the only option is a file with some other form of DRM that won't work on my kindle.  If the big publishers stopped using DRM, I would stop buying ebooks from Amazon and buy all of them directly from the publishers.<p>If such were to happen, I'm sure that other people would offer cloud services that would allow you to upload your eBooks from wherever you buy them and then access them from your device over your choice of wireless carrier.

Android requires a permission for Internet access, and another for accessing contacts, and another for sending SMS messages, and over a hundred others.<p>I WOULD love to have the option (on Android) of querying a user for a permission after install; the ""read system log"" permission, for instance, is useful for the 0.1% of cases where there's a crash, but I have to request it for everyone if I want to get complete crash reports (the Google crash reports are useless since I use NDK and the Java stack trace, which is all it sends, doesn't tell me anything).<p>But honestly, with the fine-grained security model on Android, it would be a pain if every complex app had a half dozen permission requests -- and some would have a dozen or more. Frankly that would be what people would complain about if it were true. The iOS model only works because apps are SO open by default on iOS.<p>So I don't think the Android model is a design mistake, but rather a security necessity given that Google doesn't even take a cursory look at an app that's going up in the Market. Apple can at least claim that they've checked out each app to make sure it behaves well, though it seems even then that a few slip through the net and behave badly from time to time.",1322525480

I can see the ease or difficulty of moving books between the two affecting its performance.<p>If it's easy to buy from B&N and put it on the Kindle, and buy from Amazon and put it on the Nook, I can see people purchasing from both stores.",1322525307

At the time, you could only get a Kindle online, and she didn't want to buy one without seeing the device first; so we bought a Nook reader (after she played with it in the store).<p>Over the next year, we probably bought about $2000 of books on it, when she finally got tired of being envious of my Kindle (which I had recently purchased) and I gave it to her.<p>She ended up spending like three weeks cracking the DRM on all the Barnes and Noble e-pub books she had purchased, so that she'd be able to read them on the Kindle.<p>Most people wouldn't have done that, I suspect. They'd have just stuck with whatever platform they initially decided on (and had amassed a collection of DRM-laden files with).",1322525294

Is there some data, analytics from a well traveled site, that can tell us what percentage of users tend to use spacebar to scroll a web page... or use page up / down? My gut tells me it won't be a big number. If I'm right than this is only a problem for power users, who make up a small percentage of potential users / customers.

I was tempted to buy books from Apress today (they have a all e-books are $15 special).

10258569,comment,10253010,10254862,0,0,dchest,,,"PBKDF2 is actually a crappy standard:<p>- The work factor depends on the length of hash. For example, if you compute and store 64 bytes of PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, an attacker needs to only compute the first 32 bytes to verify the guess, and with PBKDF2 it means doing half the work.<p>- In most common use (with HMAC), it inherits HMAC &quot;vulnerability&quot;: a password longer than the hash function block is equal to the its hash (see this Twitter thread: <a href=""https://twitter.com/dchest/status/421595430539894784"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/dchest/status/421595430539894784</a>). For example, `plnlrtfpijpuhqylxbgqiiyipieyxvfsavzgxbbcfusqkozwpngsyejqlmjsytrmd` and `eBkXQTfuBqp&#x27;cTcar&g*` have the same PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1 hash. (Scrypt is also vulnerable, BTW, as it uses PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256.)<p>- PBKDF2 is commonly used with hashes which are fast on GPU or custom hardware and require tiny memory, thus making defense/attack cost ratio very bad. See scrypt paper for cost estimates (<a href=""https://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt/scrypt.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt/scrypt.pdf</a>).<p>BTW, we had Password Hashing Competition (<a href=""https://password-hashing.net"" rel=""nofollow"">https://password-hashing.net</a>), the (tweaked) winner of which will hopefully be widely used in the future.",1442930354

Design constraints on microcontrollers include: power, clock speed, FPU, number of digital GPIO, number of analog GPIO, quality of IDE and debugger, price, package size, available operating systems, longevity of part, volatile and non-volatile memory, quality of compilers, peripherals and so on.<p>IME, Atmel had a great 8-bit series with good documentation and few bugs that scaled from 8-pins to 40 very well.  With analog inputs <i>and</i> PWM output, they were well-equiped to do analog input->processing->output tasks.  They really blew it when they moved to 32-bit as others have said.

ARM M (&quot;M&quot;->embedded) Cores like stm32f4, Freescale Kinetix, etc. have all but obliterated Atmel.<p>Finally differentiation in the Cortex family includes ethernet (F27/F29), Front-side Memory Controller, FPU, low-power (STM32L0), <i>extreme</i> low power (MSP432), low-price (STM32F0) and so on.",1442930329

understanding is that, really,
there is nothing Congress can
do about a SCOTUS decision
such as Roe v Wade just by
passing a law and getting the
POTUS to sign it.  And should
a US state pass a law against
abortion, the legal system
would instantly use Roe v Wade
to strike down that state law.<p>If all that is
so, then the only way to 
make abortion illegal is to
reverse Roe v Wade, and there
are only two ways to do that,
(A) have another case brought
to the SCOTUS and accepted
for review by the SCOTUS and
with enough new justices to
reverse Roe v Wade and (B)
have a Constitutional amendment
with, as I mentioned, 2/3rds
of the House, ....  IMHO, the
chances of either (A) or (B)

none.<p>If all that is correct, then

That doesn&#x27;t seem like a good metric, because it overvalues changes in T.  For example, say we currently can manage 10% compression (ratio = 100/90 = 1.11) and it takes us 16ms.  That&#x27;s<p><pre><code>    r / logT = 1.11 / log(16) = 0.2775

Now we have two proposals.  One brings us to from 10% compression to 55% compression (ratio = 100/45 = 2.22) while the other one drops compression time to 4ms:<p><pre><code>    r / logT = 2.22 / log(16) = 0.555
    r / logT = 1.11 / log( 4) = 0.555

For example, for oil, the US has an annual cost of $0.2b for storing about $44b worth of oil i.e. a 0.45% annual cost. You&#x27;d expect if the reserves are dumped for an entire year for example, that smart investors would be happy to start paying a 0.45% annual cost once the price drops by slightly more than that. At 5-10% at such a scale, despite other price fluctuation risks, that&#x27;s already a significant arbitrage opportunity that would generate enough buying power to put a floor under a small price drop.<p>That having been said, the US actually ran a planned long-term programme for oil storage. But if someone suddenly floods a market, there probably isn&#x27;t infrastructure and expertise to immediately seize that as an arbitrage opportunity. If it happened every few years then there&#x27;d be tons of cheap storage, if it happens once every few decades, then sudden gluts probably dump the price with little capacity for investors to immediately buy back in. And this is coincidentally a few years short of derivatives taking off on a big scale, Allende died the year of the Black-Scholes model, which would&#x27;ve made everything more frictionless and easier to invest and trade in for the various parties (producers, investors, storage, buyers etc)<p>Of course it wasn&#x27;t the only factor, it may have dropped prices by a few percent and that&#x27;s already very significant. Remember that a lot of US employees and advisers left the country after the copper industry was appropriated, replaced by people with very different backgrounds and no experience to manage these companies. I&#x27;ve seen some sources that said the price of production went from 20 n something cents to 40 n something cents, while the price on the market was something like 49 cents. Profits were squeezed hard. Combined with sanctions on Chile (much of Chilean copper went to the US, Europe and Japan, big allies who could impose quotas and tariffs), a small price drop due to extra copper flooding the market and similar issues in other markets, could and indeed did create layoffs, economic woes and friction in Chilean society.",1442929689

Staffing costs are typically the lions share of business costs for software companies.

Moving household controls like heating to a virtual interface would allow me to control everything from the same place, eg. my laptop (which I&#x27;m normally sat in front of anyway). It also allows meta-level controllers to be written, eg. using cron jobs, or defining a bunch of common settings like &quot;cold night&quot;, &quot;frugal&quot;, etc.<p>- Home automation. This makes control automatic, and can involve homeostatic properties, eg. thermostats keeping a constant temperature; reactive systems like motion sensors switching on lights; to constraint/rule-based scheduling of tasks and appliances (eg. the washing must be done by Friday, but use the cheapest electricity; ensure heating and cooling are never on at the same time; etc.)<p>- Putting it all online. I think this is the biggest problem at the moment. It&#x27;s being pushed by vendors, presumably because they can gather usage data, push automatic updates, and mobile access is easier to set up with one centralised server rather than using WiFi. There are benefits to doing this, but I think they&#x27;re massively outweighed by the security considerations; it would take a big technological leap from the current models to change that (eg. the widespread use of practical verification; or robust damage limitation mechanisms, like capability models; etc.)",1442928557

Not having to deal with long exposures makes this quite a bit more approachable as a hobby.<p>> This technique usually requires a telescope with an equatorial mount and a motor that allows you to &quot;follow&quot; an object in the sky while taking pictures of it, which by itself is already quite challenging to build<p>When we&#x27;re dealing with stacking images digitally, an azimuthal mounting can work. A computerized &quot;goto&quot; alt-azimuth telescope mount suitable for amateur astro/planet photography is well within the budget of a hobbyist (a few hundred bucks is enough for an entry level mount).<p>This is also how the giant telescopes operate, they all are alt-azimuth mounted these days. The last equatorial giant telescope built was the Mt. Wilson observatory built in the 1930s or so.<p>The issue with alt-azimuth mounts is that the image gets &quot;rotated&quot; as the mount tracks the object in the sky. This can be corrected digitally by rotating the image and aligning it to background stars. Equatorial mounts don&#x27;t have this issue and they can be used with long exposures on photographic plates.<p>Despite all this new fancy digital technology, astrophotography is still a very challenging task and a fun hobby!",1442927689

10258296,comment,10257713,10257988,0,0,mikekchar,,,"In my opinion, share-alike licenses are important when you want to establish a level playing field for competition.  With a share-alike license nobody has more rights than anyone else.  The exception is the copyright holder (if there is only one) who can re-license the work.<p>There are many situations where this level playing field is useful.  For example, consider it like a consortium.  If you have many groups in the consortium, you want each group to contribute equally.  The only way they are likely to do that is if one group doesn&#x27;t get an unfair advantage.<p>So the downside of permissive licenses (like MIT) is that it can (in some cases) discourage cooperation.  Let&#x27;s say you have a library that you license with a permissive license.  Your competitor may not want to contribute (publicly) to that library because they fear that you will use their changes in your proprietary code to gain advantage over them.  In fact, there is an advantage to consuming permissive code and keeping your changes to yourself as long as you don&#x27;t mind paying the cost of merging upstream changes.<p>Conversely, there are times when a permissive license is more appropriate/beneficial.  In some cases, there is no real risk that others will &quot;horde changes&quot;.  For example, if you are the author of a programming language, it is in everybody&#x27;s best interest to continue to develop it.  Nobody really gets any advantage by making their own proprietary Ruby implementation, for instance.<p>People should think very seriously about which free software license they choose, because it makes a difference.  Permissive licenses lower the barrier to entry, but potentially create one-sided advantages for some players.  Share-alike licenses ensure that everybody is working with from the same place, but makes the barrier to entry higher.<p>Generally speaking, if you look at the free software ecosystem, you will see natural divisions.  Software that creates an entire application (like a word processor, or image editor, etc) tends to use a share-alike license.  They do not want someone to take their work, add some proprietary icing to it and take mind-share from their project.  On the other side are development tools and libraries which tend to use permissive licenses.  Nobody benefits from making proprietary versions of these things.  Even if some tries to do so, nobody will be interested in it.<p>There are people who feel that ensuring everybody has the same opportunities is morally a better choice.  Obviously some people disagree, but I often find it surprising that the two sides can&#x27;t at least understand the other&#x27;s point of view.",1442927500

Nowhere does that appear she merely loves her work and does &#x27;extra stuff&#x27; because it&#x27;s &#x27;unavoidable&#x27; and considers them &#x27;secondary&#x27;. That&#x27;s one thing. It looks like she doesn&#x27;t do the extra stuff at all, purposely avoids them and that there&#x27;s nothing secondary to work because it&#x27;s all she lives for. She works 7 days a week and says she literally works from the moment she wakes up to the moment she goes to bed and designed her life so she doesn&#x27;t have to dwell on &#x27;extra stuff&#x27; like what to wear, and so she can sleep less, doesn&#x27;t date at all and hasn&#x27;t been on vacation in ten years, you really think there&#x27;s nothing else to life than that? Ridiculous. That&#x27;s totally different from your everyday &#x27;I love my job, I work 80 hours a week with pleasure and have a family, go on vacation, do sports and meet new people for fun, go dancing etc besides work&#x27;. You&#x27;re describing the latter in which case yes, it&#x27;s completely fine to consider sports or hobbies as secondary to work if work is your nr 1 hobby, but for her there&#x27;s no secondary. There&#x27;s work and then there&#x27;s sleep and that&#x27;s it, and she&#x27;s doing everything she can to reduce the latter and make more efficient the former, and no matter what you may say, she is totally missing out on a shit ton of things. Of course it&#x27;s a personal choice and I&#x27;m in favour of her having the ability to make it, obviously. Life is a game of trade offs and the choices she makes are hers and I admire them a lot on some level, but let&#x27;s not pretend there&#x27;s no tradeoff here, life is clearly more than work, that&#x27;s what Raverbashing said, you asked why, and I explained, it&#x27;s as clear as day there&#x27;s much more to life than the 7 day, 100% of her waking hours working work schedule, it&#x27;s an objective fact you can&#x27;t challenge.",1442927054

I'd just keep going back this point - it was a team problem (between you and the manager), which the manager should have escalated. Since he was obviously partly to blame (two people don't clash just because one of them is wrong), he should have gotten <i>his</i> boss in to deal with it, or gone to another third party.

While genuinely interested in the humanities and core curriculum offered at my school, I loathed the slow pace of the classroom. I wanted to jump ahead and skip the basics and go straight to the ""fun stuff!"" I harnessed that energy and began skipping classes, teaching myself a self-selected curriculum and started developing software. Unfortunately, that path wasn't compatible with the university and I soon found myself on academic leave. It was 1995, however, and the budding Internet era was my oyster. I said goodbye to school and never looked back. Well, at the behest of a college professor I did consider returning to school a few years later but ultimately declined the offer.<p>Flash forward 7 years, and I was already a (twice) successful entrepreneur and now executive at a global media company. The lack of a college degree and formal education had not (in any meaningful way) impeded my career, nor had it handicapped my ability to continually learn, adapt and innovate.<p>One day, Microsoft came knocking. They were recruiting me to join the team. They flew me in for the infamous day of interviews and Mensa riddles, and not a single person asked me about my education. That is until the (8th and) final interview of the day. The head of the division said something along the lines of, ""so, I see here that you never graduated from college?"" I more or less shrugged off the question, made some smug remark about my entrepreneurial tendencies and referenced his boss, Bill Gates. I'll never forget his response. He said, ""look, college is like bootcamp. Above all else, it prepares you for life by requiring you to follow someone else's rules. If you couldn't follow the rules of your school for 4 years, how do I know you will follow ours?""<p>It may seem obvious to others, but for me, that was the very first time someone had framed the college experience in a way that, well, actually resonated! There was a sudden, epiphany-like clarity. I couldn't even tell you what I said next. But the interview did go well, and they made me a formal offer the next day. I turned it down. You know why? He was right, whether I was capable or not wasn't the issue. I didn't <i>want</i> to follow their rules. In fact, I soon after resigned my position at the media company and set myself back on the entrepreneurial route. I've been innovating and starting businesses ever since. Marching at the beat of my own drum and happy as a clam.<p>Each individual's life experience is unique, and I'm certain others might disagree with my message and sentiment. However, college <i>is</i> kind of like bootcamp. Many people benefit from its structure and curriculum, and the social experience it offers. Hey, it's not for everyone, but I do believe that if you have that fire burning inside of you, if you hear that drumbeat in your head, and are disciplined enough to learn as you go and manage your own education, you won't let a missing piece of paper hold you back.<p>Good luck!",1315201142

It might feel scary the first time, but don't be afraid, you're in IT, there are TONS of jobs out there.<p>5) Unless you're climbing the corporate ladder, do not participate in the office politics, or at least make fun of it. Yeah, you will probably not get promoted to a director or a CTO, but who cares? Do you want to develop things, or become a manager? Office politics is usually ugly, I've seen so much backstabbing in the industry among manager types and crappy developers, it's not funny. I've seen one shitty developer taking a code of a much smarter one, showing it off to the clueless director, showering him with gifts, and getting all kinds of raises and promotions.  You can't fight it if higher management doesn't understand what's going on. All you can do is move on.<p>6) Most people are good, don't take it too personally, shit happens.<p>7) If you ever want to be in charge, start your own company.",1315198929

I have no (finished) degrees from any universities, however, I've been employed time and time again, and I continue to innovate and have a drive for learning. That being said, some fields simply require a degree. I would feel a little uneasy (scratch that: a lot uneasy) about seeing a doctor or a lawyer who was self-taught.<p>This is all pointless if you can't afford school in the first place. I know too many people who fork out $40,000-160,000 for a four-year college degree, and for what? Most of them are ""unemployable"" as soon as they exit with their shiny, expensive piece of paper. This is why I chose to stop going to school and focus on making myself ""employable"" by learning new languages, new techniques, marketing myself, getting better and better at what I already know how to do, and focusing on gaining experience in the work force.<p>This sounds like what you need to do.",1315198919

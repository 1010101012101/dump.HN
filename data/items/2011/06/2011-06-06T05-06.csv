2623841,comment,2623737,2623737,5,0,Xk,,,"[edit: palish deleted his comment; excerpts below for what I was responding to:<p>> Except random numbers aren't random. They only appear to be. If an online casino seeds its random number generator with current time, then you can do the same, and predict which cards it will deal.<p>> So here you are saying that bcrypt generates a random seed, and I'm thinking ""how does bcrypt get around the aforementioned problem?""<p>> If you don't want to answer my specific question (""why is bcrypt stronger...""), then don't.<p>]<p>I'm neither tptacek nor a security expert, but I think I know bcrypt well enough to answer your questions. Apologies if anything I say isn't correct; someone correct me if that's the case.<p>Starting with the problem: SHA1+salts are well and good. The password isn't in plaintext, so I can't just read it. SHA1 has no real cryptographic attacks on it. The salts prevent rainbow table attacks.<p>Except there's a major flaw. SHA1 is <i>fast</i>. SHA1 is <i>very</i> fast.<p>When you hash your password with SHA1+salt (even if you use a 1024 bit salt) an attacker will get a GPU cluster and run billions of hashes per second until they bruteforce your password. Anything under eight characters will fall in under a day, easily.<p>Now, let's talk bcrypt. Based off of blowfish (which has a reasonably long key-schedule algorithm), bcrypt is designed to be very slow. Very very slow.<p>If you want to think of a very naive way of doing this, imagine my hashing function is simply 
salt||SHA1(SHA1(SHA1(SHA1(...(SHA1(password||salt))))))
It is easy to see how this would take significantly longer than simply salt||SHA1(password||salt). Now there's some other details that you don't seem to be interested in, but that's the main idea. If you care to read more, see the paper.<p>This means that if an attacker would try to bruteforce even the simplest passwords, it would take significantly longer. Look at the chart on page 11, for example.  The nice thing about this is that you can, over time, adjust it to take longer and longer as computers get faster and faster.<p>So, bcrypt isn't some fancy thing which picks salts in some random way (although it does get salts; as for how, I don't know, but /dev/random would work just fine).<p>If you care about it and want to look in to it more, scrypt is also interesting -- it also uses as much memory as it can to stop simply throwing just CPU time at a problem.",1307339817

The compensation structure of a VC looks something like this: we make 20% of returns and <i>2% of the committed fund size every year as a management fee</i>.<p>If a VC pours $100 million into a company and, four years later, it blows up, the VC has moved about $110 million from the investor's pockets into a) $100 million into the company and b) $10 million into their own pockets.  (Less their operating expenses, which are not nearly on that level.  Often times their operating expenses get paid out of that $100 million, too -- e.g. VCs charging the company they invest in for the legal expenses associated with doing the investment.)",1307339645

Once you're hooked, it's hard to switch. You cannot really compare Windows and MS Office with a game for which you lose interest in 2 weeks.

What stops a random malicious person from popping a few boxes in Country X and using them to base his attack?  And if Country X was engaged in bad behavior, why wouldn't they take a similar step?<p>Now, if it's true that the attacks focused on human rights workers that gave China trouble, the claim is a bit more substantial, although it's not hard to imagine tacking those names onto your list to disguise what was really important in your unrelated attack.<p>However, attributing attacks to Anonymous really makes my head spin. By definition, Anonymous doesn't even exist as a group, it literally means anonymous in most contexts, yet the media report as if they're saying something other than 'unknown'.<p>Craziness, and as far as I see, details about the foundation of these claims are never released.

2623824,comment,2622576,2623158,8,0,deno,,,"This is like XML Myths 101.<p>> xml seems too bloated<p>To cite Wikipedia, The XML encoding may therefore be shorter than the equivalent JSON encoding. Please provide a fragment of XML document that is significantly more verbose than its JSON counterpart.<p>> dom and sax parsers require lots of code to walk trees compared to just a single json parse call and then you can just directly access things in an object.<p>Using DOM/SAX (especially SAX) is like walking the JSON's AST. You're doing it wrong (this is too low-level).<p>The second problem with this argument, is that people using it are selling you something that isn't real. You can't just directly access things in object. You need to deal with untrusted input that is just coincidentally mapped to your very basic data structures (dictionaries, lists and numbers and strings). You <i>will</i> have to write schemait will most likely be something that is different to each ecosystem (Y.Dataschema.JSON for Javascript, Colander for Python, etc.), and then you will consume exactly what you would consume with any other format, be it XML or Thrift or PB, that is your DAL objects, your representation objects if you're doing REST.<p>If you are doing it any other way, if you're doing it the nave way, you're living in a fantasy landyou're using not only something that wouldn't scale, but something that is unsafe and unnecessary, yes!, verbose.<p>A very simple case for a web-application (and this is for where I argue), is that by using JSON.load() you're loading everything to memory. That makes you vulnerable for a simple dumb attack like this:<p><pre><code>    {""malicious"":{""document"":[{""how"":{""many"":{""nested"":{""dictionaries"":{""can"":{""your"":{""webapp"":{""handle"":{""per"":{""how"":{""many"":{""webapp"":{""requests"":{""before"":{""it"":{""runs"":{""out"":{""of"":{""memory"":{""?""}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}]}}
</code></pre>
So you need to use streaming parser with a schema, to drop request when there's first sign of trouble, or you need to limit your webapps to requests that are no more than thiiis big, which of course limits you as to what you can include in that JSON document (if you want to include 5MB file, you will need to be ready for 5MB of nested dictionaries and lists). Not that you can't do that with JSON, however it's not just JSON.loads() anymore, now is it?<p>You asked why someone would prefer XML over JSON. Well apart from XML having dealt with all of this issues long time ago and is widely supported, how about the fact that XML is great for the Open Web and JSON will slowly kill it?<p> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json</a><p> <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2588606"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2588606</a>",1307339195

2623777,comment,2623182,2623182,46,0,grellas,,,"Very nice piece.<p>A few technical points on tax (of course, check with your professional advisor for any real-world case):<p>1. IRC 83(a) sets the baseline: you are taxed on the value of property (stock) received in exchange for services as ordinary income. IRC 83(b) says that you do not receive such property immediately if it is subject to a ""substantial risk of forfeiture"" and that you will be taxed on it only when the forfeiture risk lapses and you truly own it. Thus, with restricted stock, you are subject to tax at ordinary income rates on the difference between what you paid for it and what its value is at each vesting point. If your 1M shares vest at 1/48th per month over 4 years, and you paid $.001/sh, you would have to pay tax on the ""spread' at each vesting point as long as the price exceeded $.001/sh at that point. This theoretically could mean that you have as many as 48 taxable events during the 4-year period of vesting. All of this, of course, is done away with if you file a timely 83(b) election. In that case, you normally pay no tax up front and you pay only capital-gains tax on the stock as you later sell it. This is the optimum tax treatment for most startups but is normally made available only to founders.<p>2. Now what about options. The default rule here concerns so-called ""non-qualified"" options (NQOs, sometimes called NSOs as well, for ""non-statutory options""). The substantive law rules relating to such options are the same as any other options and they are ""non-qualified"" only in the sense that they don't qualify for the special tax advantage of ""incentive stock options"" or ISOs, which are special types of options that get special tax advantages. To understand ISOs, you need to understand how <i>all</i> options are taxed apart from any special tax-advantaged rules.<p>3. With NQOs, you get a right to buy company stock at a fixed strike price exercisable as your options vest over a prescribed period. If your strike price is $.001/sh, and you exercise 1M options, you pay $1,000 to get 1M shares of stock. If the fair market value of that stock is $.001/sh at the time you exercise, you pay $1,000 for stock worth $1,000 and you realize no taxable income. If, however, the fair value of the stock is worth more (let us say, $.20/sh) and you exercise your first increment of (say) 250K shares at year one of vesting on a 4-year plan, then you realize $49,750 worth of taxable income upon your exercise. This is taxed at ordinary income tax rates and the amount is factored into your employment income so that you effectively pay all normal employment taxes on it as well (social security, etc.). Hence, with NQOs, you pay tax on the ""spread"" at ordinary income tax rates upon each exercise. When the transaction is done, you very likely will hold illiquid stock, you will have no cash from the transaction with which to pay the tax, and you are generally in a highly disadvantageous tax position. Once you make the exercise, any later appreciation on it is not taxed until you sell it and, at that time, you will be taxed on that subsequent appreciation at capital gains rates.<p>4. With ISOs, when you exercise your options, you are not subject to an immediate tax based on ordinary income tax rates and this is the special tax advantage that ISOs have. The idea is that, with these tax-advantaged options, employees should feel free to buy their shares by exercising their options whenever they like (once they have vested) and will only be subject to tax at the time they ultimately sell the shares. Having exercised and bought the shares, your holding period begins to run and, if you hold them for the prescribed period (which, in the case of ISOs, is 2 years), you pay LTCG rates - all in all, a huge advantage over the NQO tax treatment. But there is a clinker with ISOs and this is the AMT, or alternative minimum tax. With an ISO exercise, the spread amount is includable in your income for purposes of calculating your AMT and, therefore, even though you may not have to pay tax at ordinary income tax rates on the value of the spread, you may wind up paying a substantial tax under the alternative measure applied by U.S. tax laws. This means that, in a high-value company, you definitely need to check with your tax advisor to determine your tax hit prior to doing such an exercise.<p>5. ISOs granted with an early-exercise privilege (as noted in this piece) are taxed substantially the same as restricted stock and this is a huge advantage. However, startups do not normally offer this privilege for various reasons (mainly because it is a mistake to make large numbers of employees instant shareholders) and so it is not really a practical answer to most such situations.<p>6. Thus, restricted stock is near-ideal from a tax standpoint, avoiding most tax risks and positioning your holdings for LTCG treatment, but is normally granted only to a very few people (mostly founders). ISOs avoid ordinary income but may subject you to an AMT tax hit - in addition, they can be used only with employees. NQOs are least favorable, subjecting you to an ordinary income tax hit on any spread as of the date of exercise, but these are valuable for their flexibility (they can be used for contractors, directors, and others besides employees).",1307337577

Some small fraction of these genes would be involved in cancer, although the exact proportion is an interesting question which we're not entirely sure of.  Perhaps with splice variants we're getting into the millions, but obviously you can't consider splice variants to be unique proteins.  In any case, the problem is at least 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the author is thinking.  Currently, there are 10s of thousands of cancer researchers worldwide, and hundreds of millions of patients, so the studies he talks about are quite feasible.<p>More troubling is the fact that with the huge amounts of money available, cancer biology attracts a gigantic number of researchers, many of whom are not doing especially great science.  There are many, many different pathways in the body that can drive cancer generation, so you can study almost any of them and call yourself a cancer researcher, even though the chances are that most of that work won't lead directly to a cure.<p>My opinion: cancer is impossible to cure - people will always get cancer.  There are deep, fundamental connections between our ability to evolve and adapt to our environment and the inevitability of getting cancer.  My opinion on how to beat the disease: genomic profiling of an individual's propensity to develop cancer, early detection, anti-metastasis drugs and improved surgical procedures.<p>For anyone interested, there is a fantastic review called ""The Hallmarks of Cancer"", published in Cell that you should check out.",1307336418

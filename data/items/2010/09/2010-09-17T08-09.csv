If you don't have a business name, then it's just your own name as a sole proprietor.  You can give yourself a real work history and paychecks, just like you would be receiving by working for any other company.  Whatever is left over after your regular paychecks you can give yourself as a periodic bonus.  Of course, if you don't make enough money to give yourself regular paychecks, or those paychecks are small, then you aren't making enough to convince a bank to give you a loan for a house.",1284713814

1700512,comment,1700293,1700293,0,0,jacquesm,,,"> All life is work<p>So better make sure you enjoy your work! Otherwise doing more of it is going to make you feel miserable. Just like there are employees that are unhappy in their jobs because of the nature of the job so it happens that in freelancing if you don't like your job you're going to feel bad. Especially if you are doing more of it...<p>> The hunter lives in a hard world<p>Yes, but when you are kicked out, laid off, fired then work divorces you. Employment is paper-thin security, you are basically living at the whim of someone else. As a freelancer if you are not 'pipelining' your work you are doing it wrong. You need to set up your rates so you can afford some slack (you are that good are you?), and then you need to push a little bit too much work in to the pipeline working prospects and turning them in to customers. Over time you will find yourself with a portfolio of customers. Periodically you review them and you raise your rate in those cases that you'd rather be doing something else. As a freelancer that is good, work finds you.<p>> weekly paychecks are a luxury<p>Yep. So a freelancer <i>saves</i>. If you don't have the attitude that will let you save half of your income on the spot for taxes and rainy days freelancing is not for you. Suggest you get a dayjob in stead until you close the hole in your hand and you can plan ahead a couple of months to a year.<p>> Also a luxury: heartburn meds and that spleen transplant you really need<p>I have been self employed for as long as I care to remember and have on occasion paid cash for an operation I needed, but now have state required mandatory health insurance. Things actually got cheaper for me. This will vary country to country, and in some places it's really hard to find decent health coverage as a freelancer. But there are ways around that. Incorporate a company, hire yourself and your spouse as employees and sign up for a package with some health insurance provider.<p>> Hey good luck with that mortgage<p>Freelancing requires you to be in control of your own funds to a much larger extent than a day job will give you, and banks have learned the hard way that lots of freelancers can't do that. So don't look at a bank to provide you with a mortgage until you have a solid track record. Meanwhile, nothing will stop you from working a bit harder, saving a bit more and buying that house cash in 3 to 5 years time, staying in as cheap a place as you can get away with for the intermediate period.<p>> oh, and nobody else will get it either<p>So what. Who are you doing this for? Some audience? What do you care what other people think about you not having a 'job'?<p>> You might as well paint a face on a volleyball<p>Freelancing is the opposite of a lonely life for me! I've met more people than I would ever meet in a regular job. Freelancing has taken me all over the planet, caused me to meet some of the most interesting people. It's maybe time that you 'don't make money', but I've set my rates to compensate for that and am in enough demand that that still works out well. A bit of passive income doesn't hurt either, which is how a smart and savvy freelancers spends his 'idle time'. That way that time will still make you money in the future. $20 per day in passive income is definitely doable on a very low budget in terms of time invested. Much more than that will require you to work hard at a project for well over a year but that's something you will not be able to do in the beginning. Freelancing is a stepping stone to being independent completely, I think of it as a way to make money that has more freedom than a job will ever give you.<p>> So why do it? Because it's awesome<p>Then why bitch about it? I think the author should go back to a day job for a couple of weeks. Because if you really think it is awesome then any and all of the above is either 'speedbump' variety or lack of success.<p>Oh, btw, I did get that mortagage. Maybe find a better bank? The tax break made it worthwhile, otherwise I would have saved just a bit longer.",1284713729

Looking at people who do PhDs, including myself, they work 60-80 hour weeks because you can get more done in that time than working 40 hour weeks. Every startup founder ever has worked extremely long hours. Googlers and Mozillians are in the office long past 5pm.<p>Certainly your productivity drops on a sliding scale probably after 20 hours of work, but to suggest that 100 hours does not get more done than 40 is pure fiction.",1284713699

1700504,comment,1697904,1699093,0,0,ewjordan,,,"Sure, it's murder.  But I suspect most people would, on occasion, find justification to murder in order to save lives (or even just to save ""more important"" lives - wars are fought all the time on the theory that the lives of a country's citizens are more important than the lives of foreigners).<p>On reflection, perhaps a better reframing of this thought experiment (to avoid many of the issues that others have brought up) would be that a murderer has broken into your house and tied you up, along with a baby and a highly accomplished but relatively young person, and offers you the choice of which one of the others he's going to kill, along with a credible assurance that he'll kill all of you if you don't choose one (and you're not allowed to pick yourself, just because), and he'll really let the remaining two of you free once you've made a choice.

(Not rhetorically, actually curious.)<p>I guess ""be experienced web developers"" (or hiring some) would have helped them to avoid writing insecure code.  Retaining a security consultant would seem extreme given that this is an early code-only release.<p>Is their real mistake simply not doing more to counter the hype?  I mean, if you take some code you hacked together over the summer, put it on Github, and <i>non-developers start clamouring to use it</i>, that's a vanishingly improbable best-case scenario for some software developers (at least you think it is until you get the bug reports :)).  I guess they should have gone out of their way to say ""please don't host this without big scary BETA warnings""?<p>It seems like the most irresponsible parties here are whoever is hosting these services that uninformed members of the public are signing up to.",1284711589

The player decrypts the disc and re-encrypts it for HDCP, which it will only do if it establishes a valid HDCP handshake with whatever device is plugged into its HDMI/DVI/DisplayPort port. For a software Blu-Ray player, the HDCP handshake is delegated to the graphics card, and the player software will refuse to run unless the operating system guarantees that the handshake has taken place.<p>For an open source Blu-Ray player, you need the AACS/BD+ keys (which do periodically turn up, and then get changed on the next batch of discs), <i>not</i> HDCP.",1284711215

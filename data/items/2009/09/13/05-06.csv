His mom, 90 and now with failing short term memory, lives in New York.  Even dialing the phone can be an iffy experience for her.<p>What he'd like is an intercom so he or his brother could monitor his mom's apartment and speak to her without the necessity of her doing anything.  The sticking point is use from her end must be totally passive.<p>Does such a system exist?  Thanks.",1252821428
819877,comment,819084,819829,0,0,lux,,,"Very true about computers. I find even with CDs I don't get the same thing as with vinyl though. It's just not as compelling an artistic medium.<p>As to putting it on a website, that could work and some people have done exactly that, but this is cool because it turns that novelty into a product you can sell (access to a restricted area of a band's website on the promise it'll be there in a year's time is a hard sell by comparison) and this is where people know to go to buy music now so the expectation that it will cost something is already in their minds. So this just works better as a saleable product.",1252821260
819876,comment,819655,819711,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Sure, if you tank a startup, you likely lose only your investment, and you'll probably learn a lot. Problem is, you've also just spent N years of your life doing little but working like crazy. If you're lucky, you've got about 80 years to enjoy on this planet. You've got about 15 of those as a young adult. How much are they worth?<p>I have recently come to the thinking that a life in search of fun and happiness leaves one feeling empty in the longer term, where a life with intense focus on a cause you deem worthy will have plenty of fun and happiness along the way.<p>Now, most people are kind of in a borderland where they're not focused on something intensely purposeful, nor are they enjoying their life. It's a sort of limbo. But to get out of that, I think focusing on finding something worth striving hard for that will produce plenty of short term joy and enjoyment to go along with long term fulfillment.",1252821257

From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem</a> : ""There are n applicants for the position, and the value of n is known.""<p>That is categorically false when talking about marriage. How do you define ""potential life partners""? Is that anyone of the appropriate sex? Anyone who meets your criteria (but potentially you don't meet theirs?).<p>Further, the number of people you will meet is a function both of time, and of the probability that you will meet a new person on any given day. Then there's the issue that your desirability is non-linear over time, based on age, experience, etc.",1252820747

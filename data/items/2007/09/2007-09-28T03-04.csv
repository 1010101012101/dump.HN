I'm a little out of my league, but I just so happened to say exactly what she wanted to publish. The only former Y Combinator startup founder I know that went on to work for Google was one of the guys from flagr. Yes, I know that most Y Combinator companies now are founded by college graduates.<p>My first mainstream media PR hit would've been a whole lot better if she would have said ""Kevin Fischer, founder of www.hivgene.com."" instead of Kevin Fischer, Y Combinator reject. Maybe next time.<p>(to anyone wondering, she saw some posts of mine on a thread comparing Y Combinator to Techstars on the Techcrunch forums and emailed me for an interview. 22 minutes on the phone.)",1190949860

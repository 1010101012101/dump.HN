Trains, boats, planes, trucks, couriers, etc. serve semi-overlapping needs.  Trains did dominate the U.S. before the auto industry convinced people cars and highways were &quot;better,&quot; and local commuter trains were scrapped over large parts of America.   Yes, Europe has loads of them and you can&#x27;t book an actual train ticket from Paris to Amsterdam (Thalys) online ahead-of-time either.<p>As a result of this indoctrination, a cultural allergy to trains became a core value of Americanism... single-occupant car == freedom, train/bus == low class.",1440266307

If someone writes a plugin for Clack (e.g. clack-errors[1]), all applications built on any Clack framework using whatever server can use it.

The less populated and poor the destination, the higher the costs (and most remote areas are both sparsely populated and poor). I think you&#x27;re seriously underestimating the vastness of the US and the remoteness of the majority of it. Sure, given enough investment and dedication, a nationwide rail network would have been possible but the decision to build America as a car/truck country was taken in the late 40&#x27;s/early 50&#x27;s and it&#x27;s too late to reverse that, even at a governmental level. People expect to live in remote areas now and have all the comforts of a city. That&#x27;s simply not possible with rail at a sane cost. Not only are cars and trucks more flexible, but the transportation expenses can be shared between commercial and personal transportation. People in America generally don&#x27;t take trains (and don&#x27;t like them) and outside of small regional areas, passenger trains are mostly a novelty that run sometimes <i>days</i> late.

When you&#x27;re doing mostly branch free processing in large chunks that&#x27;s the trade of to make. All you need is a strait forward pre-fetcher and you don&#x27;t need to worry about latency.<p>That&#x27;s not true for general purpose CPUs that perform lots of branches, that need to predicted (so we can predict what to fetch). The data processed on CPUs tends to be different (structures vs. vectors) and lots of pointer chasing (vtables, linked lists, hash tables, trees). That requires lower latencies since the access pasterns a lot more random.<p>The stated goal of HBM is taming the power consumption (and thus also heat) of GPU systems while keeping the same (or higher) bandwidth. The name HBM stands for high bandwidth memory.<p>And while HBM has a lower clock frequency compared to GDDR5 (like 1/4) it has a much wider bus. The bus on HBM is 1024 bits vs 32 bits for GDDR. At one time it can send 32x times the data in the bus. 32x / 4 = 8. The transfer rate of is 8 times bigger. The recent radeon cards with HBM now have memory transfer speeds of 256GB/s vs the 48GB for GGDR5.<p>Again, HBM trades latency for bandwidth. It negates some the latency drops due to  1/4 of the clock by putting the HBM memory on die vs off die.<p>I think you&#x27;re conflating a few different arguments.

That logic is laughable, but Congress seems to be buying it.</i><p>Yeah that makes zero sense. If drivers are driving more, trucks will be on the road more. The actual result of sane work hours would be that more drivers would share trucks and drive in shifts, which is already fairly common. If sharing trucks is somehow impossible, then the industry could buy more trucks, to be parked waiting for their drivers to become available. Neither truck sharing nor additional parked trucks are a danger to the public.<p>It&#x27;s my understanding that drivers are typically paid by the mile. Therefore, it&#x27;s difficult to see why trucking companies care about lower speeds or shorter work weeks. If a driver drives less, she&#x27;ll be paid less. It&#x27;s almost as if they&#x27;re saying that there are no more drivers available at current mileage compensation rates.

The view that all bugs are static, determinable, and caused by a lack of care and attention, is old fashioned and demonstrably wrong.<p>In mature code bases (e.g core linux kernel), (almost) all the low hanging bugs have been picked clean. There remain only faults triggered by untested configurations, unconsidered usages, and by ordering non-determinism. The last one is particularly chaotic - you can have a system which stays up for years, but falls over due to an extremely unlikely combination of events.<p>Think about it this way: every statically compiled program with an unbounded loop, in which there are calls to malloc() with runtime-determined sizes, and differently ordered but balanced free() at later times, may crash. This is a possibility despite there being no leaks and worst case size fits in memory. The issue is the heap, with some combinations of allocation sizes, and order of malloc vs free, will fragment and effectively &quot;leak&quot;, eventually exhausting resources.

Whether it&#x27;s constant jokes about priestly molesters, a &quot;hot&quot; teach and her &quot;lucky&quot; middle-school student, or the more general sexual paradox boys face (be sexual or be an outcast <i>but also</i> male sexuality is inherently predatory and violent; try to walk that tightrope) we can&#x27;t engage in social conditioning of this sort and expect boys to grow into men who think sexual misbehavior is a problem.<p>I&#x27;m getting off-topic, but this stuff has been bouncing around my head for a couple of years now for obvious reasons. Poor sexual conduct is a societal problem, not just a women&#x27;s issue. Accepting the prevalence of people being shitty to other people on a sexual basis (gender irrelevant) is step one.

I would prefer to describe that as 23 particles of a few different kinds (ball, field player, goal keeper) and different properties (team membership, mass, fitness, whatever).<p>You could certainly invent a ball field and a field for both teams that are zero everywhere except where the ball or a player is located but you certainly wouldn&#x27;t suggest that there are ball and soccer player fields in the universe even if they perfectly describe what happens on the playing field. On the other hand we could certainly agree that there are really players and a ball located somewhere on the field with specific masses, velocities and so on.<p>Maybe you can look at it from a point of redundancy. If you describe ball and players as particles with locations and momenta you get a description that naturally matches what is going on. If you use a field description you have to place a lot of constraints on what is allowed and what not, players disappearing, a second ball appearing and so on. The field description has just a lot more degrees of freedom than the particle description and you have to impose a lot of constraints to suppress field configuration that are not physically possible.

812677,comment,812556,812556,0,0,Kadin,,,"Well that's reasonably promising.<p>I think there's still a race between IPv6 adoption and carrier-grade NAT.  If the big ISPs deploy CGN rather than IPv6, that will eliminate the big motivation behind v6 (the IPv4 address runout), while at the same time neutering the Internet into something resembling little more than interactive broadcast media.  Given that the major US ISPs--which tend to either be broadcast media conglomerates (threatened by P2P media displacing traditional broadcast) or telecommunications conglomerates (threatened by VOIP displacing more profitable wireline services)--would seem to have a motivation to go the CGN route, I'm holding my breath a bit.<p>IPv6 seems to be winning, in the sense that I don't think we'll all get stuck behind CGN and IPv4 forever, but I'm not quite ready to call the race just yet.",1252479307

I'd rather say that (almost) everyone underappreciated the risks connected to the real estate prices.</i><p>Part of the reason they underestimated those risks is that they paid attention only to the middle of the distribution, where things are approximately normal.  I wouldn't say the explicit Gaussian-ness of the models was the <i>reason</i> for the trouble, but it's hard to imagine a Gaussian model providing any sort of reasonable risk estimate for the type of thing that we saw happen.  It was so far outside the ""business as usual"" range that no risk estimate based on what was happening on most days would have been legitimate.<p><i>Taleb pushes for a strategy that consists of buying a lot of very safe assets and blending them with bets on ""extreme events"" (like buying far out-of-the-money put options). Is that a viable long-term strategy? I have my doubts, since there are no evidence suggesting that 'uncertain' strategies have greater returns that more quantified ones.</i><p>I don't know about this; it's all a question of price.  If far out of the money puts are really underpriced compared to how often they ""hit"", then he could be right.  My immediate impression is that the crappy prices you tend to get due to low liquidity in the extreme tails might make a profitable strategy tough to come by.<p>One could certainly look at the historical data over the past several decades and see whether such a strategy might have been profitable (which wouldn't necessarily tell you whether it will be profitable in the future, but might shed at least some light on the matter), but I don't have options data going back very far, so I'm not the man for the job...",1252479270

I think assigning simple labels like 'good' and 'evil' doesn't quite cut it.<p>My opinion/guess (with zero inside knowledge) is that Nathan doesn't really care about the patent side of the equation much. He just wants to do interesting ideas and get people in the room to dream up of (and sometimes build) cool stuff. Some of their work around nuclear power is super interesting for example.

812635,comment,812258,812498,0,0,greendestiny,,,"All of that being just, fair and useful is predicated on a reasonable definition of patents.<p>If there was a reasonable definition of patents then suing for infringement would be rare in comparison to companies legally acquiring licenses to patented technology.<p>Instead its easy to patent something and then wait for someone to independently come up with a similar enough technology and sue them. This would be very difficult with an appropriate definition of patents, because independent invention would be unlikely. Now in the case that another company independently comes up with infringing technology, you can happily wait for them to assume all the business and manufacturing risk and then hold the patent over their heads for unbelievable sums of money.<p>In this extortion model of pricing for patents the more obvious and less specific a patent is the higher its value. In contrast specific and innovative patents are much less likely to trip other companies up, so they have to be priced according to their value to actually make things <i>before</i> all the manufacturing and other business risks have been factored in.<p>Actual patents as means of transferring and trading in invention seems to be completely dwarfed by the ability of patents to be used to extort money from successful businesses.",1252476417

If looked at from the perspective of a manager within the manufacturing industry (Many of Canada's high net worth individuals, especially in my city, have some sort of manufacturing/hard goods background) programmers are high level production staff.<p>As a result the jobs generally aren't very exciting and don't pay much. Mechanical Engineers are more sought after in my city, at least.<p>Six figure jobs seem to be within smaller boutique firms and a few of the big companies but it is far from the norm and there aren't many of those to choose from. Programmers earning more than $150k are virtually unheard of, as far as I know. My knowledge could be inaccurate here though so please take it with a grain of salt.<p>To change it would mean more jobs of a different nature. Startups are the only solution I currently see to change that long-term. And we have many other issues to contend with beyond a smaller talent pool and scarce funding.<p>I think it'll take a few big wins by a few entrepreneurs with, as my lawyer likes to put it: ""balls of steel"", to be willing to stay in their local Canadian markets for there to be progress in making this a better place for software engineers and in turn, other startups.<p>I am starting to notice a slight change and some locals urging me to stay local. Perhaps there's hope for the future.<p>So to try and succinctly answer the question, I think the pay reflects how interesting the jobs are, unfortunately.",1322693379

We can either accept Facebook's terms or not use the service. Period. Usually, this isn't a problem, but Facebook started off small. It grew into a service with network effects strong enough to actually raise a viable argument that we agree to the terms of service under duress and therefore never manifest assent.<p>It's a unique legal situation: generally, people offended by a company's practices can boycott. However, Facebook has turned us into the product, and while we can leave, our friends might not.

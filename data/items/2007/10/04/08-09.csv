My day job is as an ER nurse (while I finish my CS degree), and it's totally the way I'd go for my medical care if there was someone around that did this.<p>Some doctors with a boutique practice take a retainer fee plus bill insurance.  Sounds like this guy is going the cash only route.  I'm sure he'll end up making more money that way, regardless.  <p>The average GP in NYC probably makes about 120,000 - 150,000.  But they have to carry a 5,000-10,000 patient load while each patient gets 15 minute appointments.  Some docs routinely see over 20 patients a day.  This guy is charging a $500 retainer for two visits a year.  That means that if he has 300 patients, he's making what a regular GP makes at an HMO.  If each patient has two visits a year, that means that he can have 2 appointments a day and make the same amount as an HMO doc.  That's his break even point.  Anything over that, and it's gravy.  I'm willing to bet that he has a 500 patient load.  So, he's bringing in $250,000 net plus extra visits and appointments.  So, by going cash only, he's probably making twice what an insurance doc would make.    <p>This guy also does house calls only. So, he doesn't have the overhead that he'd normally have with an office--staff, office rent, equipment, etc...  He doesn't have to hire billing specialists.  He outsources all of his X-Ray and lab work, so no overhead there.  And, he has an unofficial network of non-jerk specialists that he can refer people to that he likes working with.  <p>I'm surprised that this hasn't caught on more than it has.  <p>If you're his patient, look at his appointment schedule.  He's giving people a half-hour to one hour time slots.  And, he does a lot of his consultations over the wire, via IM, video chat and cell phone.  He probably doesn't have to see his patients most of the time, and it's a lot easier for his patients to get in touch with him.  His patients are happier and he has a much better quality of life.  <p>Brilliant.",1191486930

Especially if other people have to work with the code, and don't know it well, they can wade into it with confidence that they can be confident they won't break anything (or at least are less likely to).",1191486853

From the FAQ:\n<i>... I accept absolutely no health insurance at all and my fees may not be reimbursed by your insurance company.</i><p>We all know that health insurance is a huge confusing nightmare in the U.S., but I don't think its advisable get rid of it completely. I suppose if you don't have insurance, then this doc would be a really good alternative.",1191486835

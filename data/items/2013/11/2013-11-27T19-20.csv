A couple of guns under the bed isn&#x27;t going to keep the local warlord away. There are no local police, just strongmen.<p>You already pay for people not to kill you: you fund a government and a military to create civil order, without which you&#x27;d be a peasant serving a warlord. Once you create government, you have to pick some way to control it. Democracy seems the most fair, but there is as you point out an incentive for people to vote themselves material comforts.<p>There is of course alternatives to democracy. Plutocratic libertarianism underwritten by brutal authoritarianism (I.e. Hong Kong) seems to be popular among a certain set these days. I don&#x27;t think these are fundamentally stable though. Eventually people will realize that they&#x27;d be better off under democracy.",1385582399

That&#x27;s not producing anything, any/all productive work they did was in the past.<p>If they are getting richer just by sitting on cash, it means - by definition - that the economy is increasing in size. If it ever comes to a point where too many people just sit on their savings, then the economy will retract, and all these people will start to lose wealth.<p>There&#x27;s a balance in the system: when the economy increases too quickly, it will incentivize people to stop producing (because they can live off their savings), and when the economy starts contracting, it incentivizes people to start producing (because their savings are getting worth less).",1385582283

6810661,comment,6807175,6807175,14,0,saurik,,,"> If you hover too long without saying anything, it’s extra creepy.<p>This is a networking event: if I walk up to your clique and you just ignore me, forcing me to stand there until I give up and leave in frustration before you acknowledge my presence and ask who I am, it is not me that is being &quot;rude&quot;. It is this kind of isolationist belief that makes it impossible to accumulate groups of people: be charismatic, and make everyone who comes near you get pulled into your conversation; if someone is just standing there, say something to them, don&#x27;t leave them hanging.<p>Seriously: this article is dangerously wrong on almost everything it tries to cover (the only parts that are on target are the parts at the end about escape and not being drunk); I only chose that one example because no one else here had complained about it yet, but the real complaint that needs to be made is a general &quot;no, don&#x27;t listen to this article, there are too many issues with it to cover and the result is you are going to come off creepier&quot;.<p>[time passes as I look at the article again after having looked at the comments here] Actually, no, I also need to pick on these parts, because I&#x27;m actively concerned someone will take them to heart:<p>> A great way to start a conversation with someone you admire (before you say anything about them or their work), is to compliment them on something they’re wearing.<p>Is the idea that this advice is just for women? Because otherwise, this is absolutely <i>deadly</i> advice: as a man, walking up to a woman at a networking event, talking about something other than work (which is also suggested in this article) and leading with a clothing compliment is <i>not</i> &quot;business networking&quot; and is <i>not</i> going to be appreciated by many women. (And if the person you are approaching is a man, he is going to take it as flirting, frankly whether you are yourself male or female ;P.)<p>> In every social interaction, one person usually leads with the greeting and the other person goes with it. They have to. If the person you’re meeting goes in for a hug, ...<p>Now, pair that previous paragraph with this mentality that the person leading a greeting gets to choose its level of intimacy: that a hug is appropriate, and if that&#x27;s what happens first everyone should be forced to go along with it... this is not OK. To be clear: I&#x27;m a &quot;hugger&quot;, but I would never <i>greet</i> someone <i>at a business networking event</i> with a hug unless I was <i>trying</i> to be creepy.<p>I can only imagine how bad the result would be taking this attitude and combining it with the specific advice I complained about in the previous paragraph would be construed. I realize the advice was for the receiver, but without concrete advice for the initiator, I think this gives the wrong impression of the dynamic and will lead to unwelcome situations.<p>Here&#x27;s my very simple advice: walk up to people, if in the US (probably elsewhere as well, but customs differ and you should learn the local protocol) hold out your hand for a handshake, say &quot;hello, my name is ____&quot;, wait for their name, and then ask &quot;what do you do?&quot; and try to get genuinely interested in their response. Do not introduce yourself with a spiel about yourself: they don&#x27;t care yet and won&#x27;t really listen anyway.<p>Note: while most people will answer this about their job, some people will self-select into more personal hobbies. This is fine, and is the non-creepy way for this to happen, but you are here to business network, so when you&#x27;ve exhausted that topic (and not before, as you don&#x27;t want to act disinterested) ask them what brings them to the event: this will likely shift them back to their job in a non-awkward way. If they don&#x27;t talk about a job here, just use this answer in the next section (as it will still be somewhat &quot;functional&quot;). (If they are being actively evasive they probably just don&#x27;t want to business network with you and the non-&quot;creepy&quot; thing would be to thank them for talking to you and excuse yourself.)<p>At some point they will feel the need to ask you what you do, as you&#x27;ve now spent so long actually caring about what they do (something that is probably sadly rare as everyone wants to talk about themselves). Now you get to tell them how awesome your job is, and as you already know so much about them you can pitch yourself in a way that they will best understand and that hopefully demonstrates some kind of synergy. This will hopefully cause them to start getting interested in you enough to start asking you follow-up questions.<p>At the very end of this conversation, you ask them for a card; if they cared about the conversation enough to ever think about contacting you later (and again, this should be due to the business synergy), they will now ask you for a card: you don&#x27;t need or want some silly excuse for why you are shoving cards at people (as this article suggests), you want to make the other person wish they had your card. If they don&#x27;t ask you for a card, you &quot;failed&quot;, but forcing them to take your card just so they can throw it away later doesn&#x27;t fix anything.<p>(I started typing up something about approaching groups, but it got way too complex, and I&#x27;m typing on my iPhone ;P.)",1385582186

So we add computers & crypto.<p>The document in question is condensed down to a single cryptographic hash, which (should[2]) to all intents and purposes be unique for a given document, despite being only a few tens of characters long, regardless of the size of the original input.<p>This hash then serves as proof[3] that you have the source document, without anyone being able to turn it back into the original document. This is a very one-way process.<p>Then, you need to find someone to vouch for your hash and indicate when they first saw it. You can do this with lawyers/notaries again as before[4], which partly solves the forgery problem, but not the trust one.<p>The solution proposed here is to store that hash in the bitcoin block-chain, which is a distributed log of all transactions on the bitcoin network, which has 3 nice properties:<p>1. It&#x27;s append-only. Once your hash is encoded in there, it&#x27;s staying there as long as bitcoin exists[5].<p>2. It&#x27;s peer-to-peer/distributed. There&#x27;s no single controlling organisation you need to trust for answers.<p>3. It&#x27;s updated regularly enough that timestamps can be relatively fine-grained.<p>So you stuff it in there using this tool or whatever, and then X years hence when you need to prove you&#x27;d actually created that file in 2013, you should be able to prove that to most people&#x27;s satisfaction.<p>This is a loose take on the matter and glosses over whole swathes of other complexities involved, but is probably close enough for [non]government work :)<p>[1] That is, who discovered/did something first.

It&#x27;s why you probably shouldn&#x27;t use MD5 for anything nowadays, for example. But again, we&#x27;ll handwave &quot;Done Properly = unique identifier&quot;.<p>[3] Well, in the same way that a password proves that you&#x27;re the/a person who knows that password - if you did it right and never told anyone, it should be exclusively you. But if it leaks somehow, others could represent the hash as belonging to something they own. But if they only have the hash and not the original source document, there are relatively easy tests that could distinguish them.

When you want to timestamp something, you (just like this service) hash it together with the previous entry in the system, sign it, and publish that.  The proof of the timestamp lies in how you had to look at the previous entry to make it, and the next, at yours.  Compromising it would require a large number of participants to cooperate to re-write the history (and the participants&#x27; own records).<p>What this service does is avoid the need to integrate with an existing service or pay any of the record-keeping costs yourself, and it does so by piggy-backing off of bitcoin&#x27;s distributed timestamp system, thereby making your timestamps at least as valid as bitcoin&#x27;s, and increasing (significantly) the number of conspirators required to falsify it.<p>tl;dr: This is just like existing crypto timestamp systems except for the more extreme decentralization and using the bitcoin network&#x27;s resources.",1385581618

I&#x27;d agree that that choice is desirable independently any other changes (and it really has nothing to do with flat vs. progressive taxes or basic income.)<p>> 5) Removes government manipulation of social policy by giving them ONLY two number to play with... MBI and tax rate!<p>To do this, government has to alter the definition of taxable income (as well as many other things.) This does not eliminate their ability to make similar decisions in the future, so it doesn&#x27;t remove any levers. (And, of course, government intervenes in social policy through things other than direct benefit programs and tax policy, so even fixing those wouldn&#x27;t have the effect described here.)<p>Generally, I find &quot;autopilot&quot; arguments of the form &quot;once we get government to decide X, government won&#x27;t be able to decide other things incompatible with X in the future&quot; to be ludicrous.<p>> 6) Finally, it provides a real mechanism for everybody to feel the effects of tax rate changes.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this makes any sense. Everybody feels the effect of rate changes now, but the utility effect of rate changes is different depending on circumstances. In a flat tax system with MBI, the same thing is true.<p>> ALL of these effects without negatively affecting market freedom.<p>Define &quot;market freedom&quot;.",1385581533

Bribe and blackmail the board members? You&#x27;re ascribing Microsoft the powers of a comic book supervillain while they cannot even sell a few million Surface RT tablets.<p>For reference, this is the profile of the chairman of the board. Do you think a bribe from Microsoft is likely to influence this person&#x27;s decisions?<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorma_Ollila"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorma_Ollila</a><p>>Jorma Jaakko Ollila (born 15 August 1950) is a Finnish businessman, since 1 June 2006, Non-Executive Chairman of Royal Dutch Shell. He was Chairman (1999–2012) and CEO (1992–2006) of Nokia Corporation. He is a member of the Board of Directors of Ford Motor Company (2000– ), UPM-Kymmene (1997– ), and Otava Books and Magazines Group Ltd. (1996–).\n>For Nokia, he was credited with turning the company into the then world&#x27;s largest handset maker.[1]<p>>As CEO of Nokia he has led the strategy that restructured the former industrial conglomerate into one of the major companies in the mobile phone and telecommunications infrastructure markets.<p>So you&#x27;re telling me that Microsoft somehow bribed that guy, who no doubt would&#x27;ve made tens of millions from turning Nokia into a $100+ bilion dollar company, made him risk everything including national shame and prison time if exposed and seeing the company he built destroyed and hand over the reins to a Microsoft mole?<p>Or perhaps the Nokia board evaluated their options and wanted Nokia to have the bags of cash from Microsoft which Google reportedly was not willing to supply and save Nokia jobs instead of turning it into another slowly dying RIM and wanted to go Windows Phone, and hired Elop to do the transition. Now, the merits of the decision itself is  subject to analysis, doubt and discussion, but the accusations of Elop being a mole derail the discussion that can be had about the Symbian and Blackberry burning platforms.<p>My conclusion is that a number of people who so strongly seem believe in this idea on tech forums either a) Don&#x27;t know how CEOs are hired or what a Board of Directors of a company does b) Listen to the conspirational ideas on Slashdot, Groklaw, /r/Android and /r/linux and take it as gospel without thinking it through because the story fits the &quot;Evil M$ kills a Linux OS&quot; victim mentality narrative they want to believe in and they want a 41MP Nokia Android phone real bad c) Jump on the popular anti-MS bandwagon without any rational thought, oh hey, free and easy karma points! d) Believe in the NASA moon hoax too.<p>That comment says more about the writer than what it says about Elop, how can otherwise smart people succumb to such group thinking?. I haven&#x27;t found one remotely plausible explanation about how Microsoft installed Elop as the CEO of Nokia. Maybe someone can help me and explain it here, but I am not holding my breath.<p>Edit: Why the downvotes?",1385581386

For instance, grab a random piece of paper on your desk with writings and then try and prove to me that the contents of that paper existed before last year, you can&#x27;t really do it (easily). Before this, the only (easy) way to achieve this would be to send this document to a third party to store into a database that it did infact exist when sent to the database, but how can you prove that database wasn&#x27;t manipulated? Another common way to prove something existed before a certain time would be to make a copy and send the copy through the mail to yourself. One you have received this copy from the mail, leave it unopened and now you have proof (through the mail service&#x27;s date on the stamp) but this isn&#x27;t too easy, some what of a hassle, and I think you could debate that you could fake it. (Faking the stamp, finding a way to get an opened document through the mail and than replacing the content later, etc.)<p>What this does is it stores a document&#x27;s signature into the actual &quot;history&quot; of bitcoins which is public. ANYONE and EVERYONE can access this history of all transactions and by them storing the actual signature of the document into this public &quot;log&quot; you are now able to say that this document DID exist before the specific bitcoin transaction.

Being a fan of the show, the guy feels compelled to say hello and meet one of his favorite TV stars. He&#x27;s nearly done with his own meal and after Seinfeld&#x27;s table&#x27;s orders have been taken, he makes his approach:<p>&quot;Mr. Seinfeld! Hi, I&#x27;m ____. I&#x27;m a huge fan of your work...&quot;, the guy says with eyes gleaming.<p>Seinfeld briefly glances at the man and then turns towards the woman he&#x27;s seated next to and smiles.<p>&quot;Would it be a bother to ask you for a picture?&quot;, the guy continues.<p>Without missing a beat, Jerry blurts out, &quot;_____, can you believe it? A person would walk up to me, ME, while I&#x27;m taking my family out to a nice family dinner, interrupt us, and then have the nerve to ask me for a picture. A picture? Can you believe it? Some people!&quot;<p>Jerry never breaks eye-contact with the woman and never again acknowledges the guy standing by his table and family. The guy eventually slumps away back to his table, pays for his meal, and leaves.",1385581026

Then the first step is to bring some critical mass and grow the inventory.<p>This is a very different kind of marketplace, built by someone like me. I have some games in my mental wishlist but I&#x27;m not in a rush to buy them, also I&#x27;m a money saver, then the option to make offers and repost them until I got a deal is pretty convenient.<p>The same goes for selling, I&#x27;m not an active seller, what I want is just to click the items I have and I want to sell and wait for a good offer that could come tomorrow on in 5 months.<p>Those are qualities that other marketplaces (Ebay, Craigslist) don&#x27;t have.

In any case a comparison between Switzerland and US is bizarre -- there are far too many differences to idly (without multivariate analysis on data that is likely not even available) claim that any one variable explains lower crime rate in one vs. the other.<p>[Edit:  I previously included a longer rant here, but, I&#x27;ll just point anyone to this CDC study -- <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/2013/06/handguns_suicides_mass_shootings_deaths_and_self_defense_findings_from_a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_natur...</a> -- and let them make their own conclusions]<p>I do happen to think that it&#x27;s better for individuals to decide on their own whether the risks of keeping a firearm are outweighed by any protection it offers. My firearms are stored unloaded, under lock, with ammo in a separate location: I live in a safe neighbourhood -- which I can finally afford to do after winning the IPO lottery (to be blunt) -- so for me the risks outweigh the benefits; I don&#x27;t, however, claim to be able to make this choice for others. I would much rather see housing prices go down (even though I will be hurt personally by this) and for the (scary) trend of growing education-based stratification of US society to end  -- stratification which is largely manifested in ways American families live.<p>&quot;Not giving a shit about legality&quot; is far worse than even outright (but enforced) bans -- it means the criminals are able to get away with it, but individuals citizens who want to actually use it for self-defense or sport cannot.<p>You&#x27;re also confusing two aspects of Swiss laws: militia members can keep their service rifle at home <i>while</i> it&#x27;s a fully automatic (i.e., an actual assault rifle) with restricted ammo (I think the restrictions, however, are to prevent the military issued ammo to be used for non-military purpose; you can still take it to the range and use it with civilian purchased ammo).<p>Separately from this, after the end of their militia service, they have the option of paying to have it permanently converted it to semi-automatic and keeping it under the same laws as other civilian firearms.<p>On the other hand, fully automatic/select fire weapons are essentially illegal in the United States, military members can&#x27;t keep their automatic rifles with them at home, and so on. Like in Switzerland, most US states do permit ownership of <i>semi-auto</i> versions of those rifles (however, afaik in the United States, they must have been manufactured as semi-automatics -- there&#x27;s murky case law that can land you into trouble for having cerrain M16 parts in an AR-15, for example).

(The marginal <i>benefit</i> might be less in the former case because of the declining marginal utility of additional income, though.)<p>> Walmart and McDonalds (and everyone else) would therefore either go out of business or raise their wages.<p>Entry level wages are artificially high compared to market labor supply because of the minimum wage, so even if BI did reduce the supply of labor for minimum wage jobs, it wouldn&#x27;t necessarily stop them from being able to fill positions at the existing wage levels. Many BI proposals also include eliminating the minimum wage, which would make work that is not currently economically viable (because, while it provides value, it doesn&#x27;t provide enough value to warrant the minimum wage) viable.<p>> Raising their wages would increase the price of their goods. Increasing prices of goods would increase the cost of living which would increase the poverty level which would increase the minimum guaranteed income.<p>This, OTOH, is a real potential issue with inflation-pegged basic income: if you set the level too high for the current economy to support initially and peg it to inflation, you&#x27;ll get caught in an inflation cycle.<p>The solution to this, as I see it, is fairly simply; dedicate a set share of the revenue from progressive income taxes to the basic income, and set benefit levels based on the lower of the levels by equally distributing the revenue from that tax to beneficiaries <i>or</i> the inflation-adjusted level of the starting benefit amount.<p>You get better self-regulation and signalling of when you need to reexamine the assumptions in your benefit levels and revenue structure, and if you initially set it at a level that would actually pull people out of the work force in a way that would trigger run away inflation, then barring direct intervention it will regulate itself back down (in real terms) until that&#x27;s not the case.",1385579970

6810286,comment,6809361,6810073,3,0,Theodores,,,"When I was a child I felt odd when visiting a friend&#x27;s house if there were no books on the shelves, as well as the books being missing I wondered if their education was missing. I felt much happier in places where the walls were lined with books. Particularly notable were the places where video cassettes adorned the walls, I never really knew what to make of that - did they just watch the TV screen all day?<p>Nowadays I don&#x27;t have books on shelves at all, whatsoever, under any circumstances. The books I have to buy because they are not available in a digital format tend to be really good and I end up giving them away, for them to not need to be returned. I really do not see a long term future for printed books, there is no need for them, except in museum-libraries.<p>What would be cool is if you could buy books for people in a digital format on a &#x27;sale or return basis&#x27;. They would get the book from you, then, if they actually read past the first few pages, your account get charged. In this way you could give out books to people for birthdays, Christmas and so on without them feeling obliged to read through whatever it is that you have sent them. Equally you could be more generous with gifting as there would be a fair likelihood that some of the books gifted would not be read.",1385578860

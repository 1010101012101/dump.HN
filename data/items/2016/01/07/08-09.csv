10856823,comment,10850205,10856736,0,0,pathsjs,,,"Thank you, I understand that, but I need a little more detail. Let me explain.<p>Languages that have generics can either erase the generic argument at runtime (like Java or Scala do) or generate a different concrete type for each instantiation (like C++ or Nim do). In either case, you usually know at compile time which concrete instances of the generic parameter are going to be used where.<p>That is, even in Java you may have a single class Stack<A>, but at the final use site this will eventually turn into some concrete type, such as Stack<String> (it may remain generic in intermediate steps). In other words, you are not going to use Stack with a generic parameter that you did not anticipate. You cannot read the runtime type of some instance, call it X, and then start writing functions that work on Stack<X>.<p>Now, let me turn to dependent types. A lot of the techniques that Idris promotes can be simulated in other languages, such as Scala, C++ or Nim. But in each case that I know of, you are required to know at compile time which concrete values you are going to use as generic parameters. That is, in C++ you can write functions that operate on types like Vector<A, N>, where N is the length, but you have to eventually specialize N to a concrete number before compiling.<p>The comment above states that Idris does not have this restriction, but it is not clear to me how that might work. I concede that by using an erasing technique (as opposed to specialization) one is not required to materialize such functions for all N - this is what one does for instance in Scala.<p>But the problem is: what do you do at the usage site? Say you are reading two lists off two JSON files, and you want to concatenate them using the above function. Wouldn&#x27;t you need to provide at compile time a concrete value for N and M? (and consequently cast the unsized vectors to sized ones?).<p>If this is the case, then there is not much difference from letting the compiler materialize a function for concrete values of M and N that are used (because in either case, you have to encode knowledge about concrete values of M and N at compile time).<p>Maybe everything would be more concrete if I saw an Idris program that reads two vectors from external files at runtime, and then concatenates them, whatever their size is.",1452156751

Three things most commonly discouraged: &quot;+1&quot; / &quot;this&quot; posts, typical Reddit jokes, and image macros. Often the latter are redirected to separate subreddits; i.e. for many /r/Something you&#x27;ll have a corresponding /r/SomethingMemes, where the fans of laughing at pictures can vent out.<p>Different subs maintain different seriousness &quot;set points&quot; - for instance, to compare the two I hang out the most on, /r/SpaceX is almost HN-level serious. Stupid and low-effort comments get deleted, and you may get banned along with them. OTOH, /r/KerbalSpaceProgram is half-serious, half-silly (just like the game).

It&#x27;s just few clicks away, and anyone can do that. So one of the effective ways of getting rid of particular kinds of comments and submissions is to just tell people to create a new sub for it. Like the /r/SomethingMemes I mentioned. /r/SpaceX has /r/HighStakesSpaceX, because people there like to bet way too much. /r/KerbalSpaceProgram has /r/HerbalSpaceProgram, because one day a popular YouTube video has spawned an unstoppable torrent of &quot;dank&quot; memes.<p>(OTOH if a subreddit goes beyond hopeless, people who long for higher levels of discourse sometimes restart it as /r/Serious... or /r/True..., and iterate as needed.).",1452155534

What would you do in a language without generic types? To achieve the same effect, you&#x27;d need to create a custom StackString type, which itself is trivial. But then, you&#x27;d need StackInteger, StackBoolean, StackSomeoneElsesCustomType, etc.<p>Language with a type system but without generics have this above downside. Usually you&#x27;d just give up making a type for each of these, and simply use the Stack type.<p>Language without Idris-like dependent types suffer the same downside: instead of creating Stack<String, n>, you&#x27;re forced to create Stack<String, One>, Stack<String, Two>, Stack<String, Three>, where One/Two/Three are unique types you created to conceptually represent a number. If you don&#x27;t even have generics, you&#x27;d need to create StackStringOne, StackStringTwo, ...<p>Dependently typed languages encode numbers (among others) as unique types, to simplify. Imagine this:<p><pre><code>  put: Stack<String, Three> -> String -> Stack<String, Four>\n</code></pre>\nThis isn&#x27;t too hard to imagine is it? No runtime checks needed. Once you get the output you can carry it around, along with its type, to places that accept Stack<String, Four>.<p>So, asking &quot;how come you don&#x27;t have to generate these checks at runtime?&quot; is similar to a programmer who&#x27;s never seen generics asking &quot;how come you can parametrize? Don&#x27;t you have to generate all the StackString and StackInteger, etc.&quot;. It just works. Hope that analogy was clear =).<p>Dependent types in general blur the line between values and types, as you&#x27;ve seen above.

We&#x27;ve spent some time doing R+D in the telephony field and we saw that the &quot;tone&quot; that plays before a phone pickup can be changed from the server, so that&#x27;s what we did.<p>After experimenting with email login, we decided to structure the product as an email inbox, where you can forward important emails using filters, and this address will misscall you when there is a new message. You don&#x27;t pick up that call, but misscall back. Then the server will play a TTS (or a voice memo, if attached) with the email contents, and hang up... without picking up.<p>We decided to launch it for free to get feedback and see its acceptance. We plan to make money with custom integrations, basically doing consulting to integrate Puput with businesses. We have more complex products which we think aren&#x27;t very attractive to end users, but can be interesting for businesses: slack integration (call everyone to make sure a message is received), broadcast audio messages with a single call, alert escalation like pagerduty, package tracking using GPS without a data plan...<p>It&#x27;s difficult to find which uses are the best fit for a &quot;new&quot; technology, so we decided to tell hackers first -- data with missed calls is actually new, but it seems we are the first ones to use it in production.<p>Some friends already signed up, and nothing has exploded yet.\nWe’d really, really love your feedback. It’s a service built by hackers, for hackers, and we chose email specifically because it is scriptable and decentralized (read more here <a href=""https://medium.com/@puput_io/email-will-not-be-killed-ce4387b27ae6#.kll4us1mr"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@puput_io/email-will-not-be-killed-ce4387...</a>)<p>It all started with a simple asterisk hack which sent data to a Postfix filter... and here we are today!

Of course, temperature will even out after <i>few minutes</i>, but for steaks (and other food you want to sear) the initial temperature drop is important  -- the higher it is, the higher chance that your steak will be steamed, not seared. Heavier pans retain more heat (that&#x27;s why heavy copper, cast iron and stainless steel pans took longer to heat during the first experiment), but that&#x27;s a <i>good thing</i> when making food.\nAlso, what this article didn&#x27;t mention, is that light, cheap pans tend to deform as soon as after few uses, what makes cooking food evenly nearly impossible on a flat surface. Cast iron and stainless steel pans, on the other hand, are nearly indestructible if used correctly, I know cases when people still use their >100 years old cast iron pans from their grand-grand fathers.",1452154433

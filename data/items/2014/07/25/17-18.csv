[2]<p><i>> Those companies that have a hiring preference for ivy league students are often just falling for the scheme as opposed to getting truly exceptional candidates.</i><p>Another theory is that these companies target Ivy League students because they&#x27;re (generally intelligent) people who have been conditioned since a young age to jump through the hoops of an elaborate application process. Top IBs and management consultancies model their hiring processes after the Ivy League application process.

A huge portion of the infrastructural code we rely on is open, but almost all of the user interfaces I actually touch every day are closed. If I want to tweak something, I have to resort to hacks.<p>Additionally, if I write <i>or modify</i> an open source web service, there&#x27;s the whole problem of hosting it. I have to essentially start a small business to host it. Or leave that to the users, which sort of defeats the purpose of a web service. If I want to change a single feature of Wikipedia, I have to re-host the entire thing AND have a plan for staying in sync with their centralized database.<p>As a result, the world of open source user-facing software is developing an order of magnitude slower than open source infrastructure software. That&#x27;s sad.<p>If I could simply write a web service, push it into a decentralized hosting network, and have the cost of keeping it deployed spread out across the network of users, then it becomes <i>much</i> more tenable to be a developer of open source web apps and services. Doubly so if there is a mechanism for me to get micropayments for the code.<p>I think if Maidsafe or something similar succeed, it will lead to a Cambrian Explosion of open source software. I know I&#x27;d write and patch lot more of it.<p>That&#x27;s why I want it.",1406310989

In comes a pull request that doesn&#x27;t live up to that. No problem. Sometimes you can ask them to correct a few things and merge away, but at other times there will be too many things and, well, you don&#x27;t want to come off as a person that is hard to deal with.<p>What do you consider appropriate etiquette regarding changing their code and/or commit messages and doing a manual merge where you pull down their branch and go to town? How this is usually done is that they will be the author of the commit and you will be the committer (Git feature), but a lot of the code might be yours, and the commit message might be yours as well. Basically, you are changing their code and wording, but they retain the main credit for the work and you stand merely as the committer of the code.<p>I have seen this happen on a several popular projects, and I can understand why. My question is: Is the author/committer feature of Git enough to indicate that the person might not have written all the code or even written the commit message? What I fear is that the code, or even the commit message, ends up being something that they would not want out there under their name when all is said and done, and that this way of managing a project will scare people away.<p>So I&#x27;m curious about people&#x27;s take on this, because I&#x27;ve seen it happen on several projects, and there&#x27;s even been blog posts here on HN about this practice.",1406310607

A critical level of intelligence must be maintained by a very large number of people in order to keep passenger aircraft in the air. Everyone, from designers to manufacturers, to QC, to maintenance to pilots to airline management has to function above a certain critical level to perpetuate the activity.<p>It is possible that clusters of aircraft accidents are purely random and part of the complex system that is air travel. However, it is possible that clusters of aviation accidents represent crossings of the boundary layer resulting from the change in a global factor, like human intelligence, that has moved the entire system probabilistically.<p>The details of some recent accidents should give us pause. The series of over-control/mis-control accidents including AF447, Colgan Air and others defy reasonable explanation, and they appear to have no precedent in recent passenger aviation. MH370 and MH17, so far as we can see, have no reasonable explanation other than unaccountable human behaviour (failing to communicate over the course of seven hours flying in the case of MH370, and navigating over a war zone in the case of MH17).<p>It is possible, although certainly not provable at this point, that we are simply becoming too stupid (in general) to fly passenger aircraft safely.

8086417,comment,8084880,8084880,7,0,616c,,,"As one of the few terminal users of Arabic in this site (emphasis on the terminal part), I want to thank Behdad and others for harfbuzz and other great libraries.  His contributions have been significant, and BiCon Arabeyes project was one of the first and only ways to show Arabic in the terminal.  This was even before SIGWINCH was a signal you could use IIRC, so that I cannot even run it in tmux, screen, and other dynamically-sized terminal emulators without a massive, massive headache.  But before that, there was not much of anything.  And things have come a LONG, LONG way since then, even if there is plenty more road ahead.<p>I started using Linux almost ten years ago, and the winter for RTL languages were just starting to thaw.<p>Since I have come to using Arabic more often in the terminal, you would be suprised how often this causes problems as text rendering is done at many different layers and there is no harmony between them.  Not only does it mean a special terminal emulator (mlterm for the win; esoteric but the only one that handles Arabic properly and handles Chinese, many Indic languages, and Hebrew unlike anyone else) but has all minaskinds of edge cases.  Text rendering happens at so many layers and with different libraries, you have to make runtime changes to get certain programs to behave with each other.  As a heavy Emacs user, Emacs will conflict with its own (default on) bidi implementation using m17n-lib (as mentioned in the article).  So what happens?  Arabic and other RTL languages go back to the original order, English-style, which is not what you want, as the operation happens twice since mlterm also uses this library (m17n-lib), but is not aware the bidi reordering happened before at the application layer.  I finally got so sick of this my most important Emacs keyboard macro is to toggle off the Emacs internal bidi ordering on and off.  Why you ask?  Because despite mlterm and Emacs using m17n-lib on my computer, I need GUI emacs to use its own internal Bidi scheme, and the terminal run Emacs (emacsclient -nw) to run without out, and let mlterm pick up from there.  I have tried other terminal emulators (someone wrote Perl scripts using, IIRC Text::FriBidi based one of the aforementioned library, GNU FriBidi) for urxvt to handle this), but it does not work as well: you get the correct ordering, but Arabic letters do  not connect (this is really glyphs, not letters, but I digress).  So if I do not toggle the Emacs macro I made, I cannot have a terminal that will show Arabic file names properly at the same time outside of Emacs, and a simple `ls` is all borked up.<p>GUI programs are not so much better.  I run i3 with my own customizations, including heavy use of the wonderful dmenu utility for searching files indexed with Recoll, connection to my password manager, and running programs on the fly.  Probably is dmenu specifically does not support Unicode at all, let alone RTL languages like Arabic, so you get a mess.  I love suckless tools; and they avoided Unicode for a reaosn, but suckless, a very common group of power user tools ignoring Unicode for their own good and embracing their mantra of well manicured C code tells you to pity developers who do take the time and bear lots of whining about this crap being inconsistent and having crazy edge cases.<p>These edge cases will not stop me from using free software, because I had no idea how complicated Arabic rendering was until using Linux, and a lot of this crap flat out is not possible in Windows anyway (try listing Arabic file names in Command Prompt), and is still terrible when you get around to it working.  Do we need a &quot;GNOME3 of text rendering&quot; as others quoted in the threads here?  I am not sure we do.  What we need is standardization of libraries or generalizing backends to choose what you need, a la Freedesktop initiatives in other spheres.  Ironically: every terminal emulator and app developer/maintainer retorts when present RTL Arabic problems: this is an application layer concern and out of my hands.  And what they ignore app developers with their application layer concerns apply with different layers of libraries unevenly, hence the aforementioned hacks.  To resolve this means removing a lot of what makes Open Source with forced standardization, and contributions like that of Behdad wonderful: choice.  So I prefer to stick with more choice, or promoting/encouraging different text rendering applications to support different backends and more importantly properly detect the existence of each other when used.  I am not a C programmer, but I think that is already where we are in the FOSS world.  It is more a matter of awareness and interest: like other software markets (commerical or not), FOSS software with any significant user base will catch up.  Find me Bengali Windows and I will laugh at you, but I have seen real impressive work with regionalized Linux distros, with full documentation for Indian communities that nothing proprietary comes close to because there is no interest.<p>Behdad, thanks again for your work.  This is the second time your stuff up on HN in recent memory.  I remember emailing you about BiCon years ago and you are still one of my open source heros with HarfBuzz and FriBidi and all that stuff.  Keep up the good work and thank you for making FOSS software international.",1406310286

As in, it&#x27;s expected to have the subpixel ordering change semi-frequently, and that change needs to happen as fast as possible.

You have cities like SF where NIMBYs are demanding all fiber equipment boxes be buried underground out of sight, and all cabling has to be tunneled. In rural areas you just string fiber on power poles or trench in the ditch.<p>As well, almost every successful muni fiber out there has been in an area with a muni electric provider, and little to no fiber providers outside of the muni, providing them an almost monopoly for commercial business. In major cities, commercial service is well served by multiple fiber providers, so the investment is mostly residential with no subsidizing by commercial. Many of these rural areas also have some of the cheapest electrical rates in the country as commercial user subsidize those.<p>Source: I grew up in Dalton GA that has muni fiber/elec 30 mins from Chattanooga who also has muni fiber/elec.

Sure, any programmer could say that about any framework/language/platform they use regularly I suppose, but in fact Rails is the first platform I&#x27;ve been able to leverage to get great jobs and work with great people. Before that, various combinations of WordPress and homegrown PHP code were my bread-and-butter but I also did projects in Java, Python, and others. (I still shutter when I remember what I had to go through to work in Java...)<p>I think the thing that was so amazing about Rails when it really got popular was that you could build almost any sort of web app you could imagine and everything would just make sense. The full-stack, the conventions, the fact it took much less time to get something working than its competitors...it was SO much easier to build stuff and stop reinventing the wheel.<p>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times in the PHP world I had to figure out how to write code to send hand-tuned SQL to the server just to do basic stuff. Obviously, these days you can do cool framework-y full-stack stuff in PHP as well, but in many respects that was a response to the rise of Rails. (Actually, I must admit, I built a PHP 5 framework somewhat inspired by Rails before I jumped onboard the bandwagon...what prompted that was Zend announcing their PHP 5 framework, at which point I figured I&#x27;d either drop my framework and go with Zend or...just go with Rails, learn Ruby, and stop fighting it.

In fact, the second point comes across as more like hey-you're-awesome mumbo jumbo that I would expect from motivational speakers.<p><i>""Good ideas alter the power balance in relationships, that is why good ideas are always initially resisted""</i><p>I don't think a blanket statement like they are <i>always</i> resisted is quite true. For example, a simple test would be:<p>2 people are caught in a house fire, person A says ""lets get out of here""... person B would have to say ""no, lets stay here"" for this statement to be true.<p>Similarly ideas can be resisted because they are actually bad ideas.<p>If anything, I would say that people are more or less resistant to change, unless there are very obvious reasons for change.",1221296352

303026,comment,302789,302789,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"It seems there are two conflicting trends that affect the use of threads for parallelism: One is that the amount RAM available to a typical machine grows fast and thus in-memory data processing becomes more important. The other trend is that some smart people prefer a process model over threads, which excludes working with a lot of in-memory data or at least makes it hugely more complex (working with shared memory blobs, no pointers, none of the usual data structures, etc).<p>I for one feel very restricted by languages like Python, Ruby or PHP because they effectively force me to use the process model for parallelism and prevent easy sharing of in-memory data structures between threads. So even though I like these languages I use C#, Java or C++ for most projects. Others may of course have different scenarios and different requirements.",1221293887

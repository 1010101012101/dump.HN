If you are then the company <i>is</i> stealing and I would advise leaving.<p>Either way you are under a moral,  and potentially legal,  obligation to bring the company towards compliance.  Advice for you is not to massively rock the boat - do not use it as a means to hurt your employer (even after leaving) do not focus too much on it.<p>IANAL; The way I would approach this:<p>- forward the this news article (not the hacker news post) and the openalpr license page <a href=""http://www.openalpr.com/license.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openalpr.com/license.html</a> to your legal contact (and manager?).  Attach a simple and professional message along the lines of &quot;Saw an article about some software we use and I am concerned we may be accidentally violating the license&quot;<p>- Do not act like you really care.  You were just exercising due diligence in your job and forwarding on to people that deal with it.  Don&#x27;t rock the boat,  don&#x27;t defend yourself,  don&#x27;t threaten.<p>- Do care.  If your company does not respond to you within a few weeks,  threatens you in any way (interrogation),  or says they are deliberately ignoring the license then you need to work on getting a new job.  This is because your employers act exploitatively and without respect to the work of others (such as yourself).  When you come into legal dispute (which happens more often with these kinds) they are not the ones you want to be fighting.  So find another job (take your time) and leave,  do not cite the license as a reason.  Once you are safe notify the developers.<p>If you are careful,  not disruptive,  and don&#x27;t use it to create gossip or push other agendas most employers will engage legal advice and work towards resolution thanking you in the process (its way better than being sued!) and you need not suddenly leave your job over an honest mistake.",1449485629

The higher serum homocysteine levels that have been reported in some vegetarians, apparently due to inadequate vitamin B-12 intake, may increase risk of CVD (111,112) although not all studies support this (113).</i><p><i>Although very little data exist on the bone health of vegans, some studies suggest that bone density is lower among vegans compared with nonvegetarians (164,165).</i><p><i>Vegetarians can, however, have risk factors for dementia. For example, poor vitamin B-12 status has been linked to an increased risk of dementia apparently due to the hyperhomocysteinemia that is seen with vitamin B-12 deficiency (188).</i><p>TL;DR:<p>The complexity is there. It is possible to eat a balanced meatless diet, but at the same time it is quite easy to screw it up, and the consequences may show up after a few years and take time to undo.",1449483805

That&#x27;s just some aftershocks of people joining the party lately.<p>However, if you are talking about Blockchain technology and applications beyond currency and gambling, there may be something onto it. For example, check out Ethereum:<p><a href=""https://www.ethereum.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ethereum.org/</a><p>This allows you to enforce and reward contracts in a very flexible and completely decentral fashion. Also, &quot;agreeing on one truth/history&quot; has been replaced from &quot;power of work&quot; (arms race to burn energy resources) to a more subtle decentral reputation system. This is more about finding consensus among the network participants as intelligent individuals, rather than who&#x27;s able to invest more energy/hardware resources more quickly.<p>Creative stuff like Ethereum has not just the potential to replace payments, but enables companies that are totally differently structured than what we find today. If that&#x27;s for better or worse, I&#x27;m not sure.<p>But if there&#x27;s any justified hype about Bitcoin, it&#x27;s about emerging projects like that - not about Bitcoin itself.",1449482415

Despite his obvious accomplishments and all the trappings of success, I would not trade places with him.  His subjective experience seems to be painful and is no less real to him than mine is to me.<p>At the same time, I don&#x27;t think he is ill.  While I don&#x27;t doubt that he is suffering, I don&#x27;t think it it is helpful to class his suffering as an illness.  I don&#x27;t think anyone argues that his symptoms are caused by an infection or a defect in an organ, so his disorder lacks the physical basis for a typical illness.  At the same time, he has symptoms.  And therapy, and possibly drugs, make him feel subjectively better.  He chooses to engage in a regime of therapy which (presumably) has self reported benefits.<p>But I don&#x27;t think it is helpful to think of his plight like we think of malaria or polio or heart disease.  When we talk about &#x27;emotional disorders&#x27;, we implicitly take on an enormous amount of cultural context as well as normative judgements about how someone &#x27;should&#x27; feel.  And the danger is that one will come to believe that an unpleasant mental state in an otherwise healthy brain is something to be cured through the application of science.<p>That being said, I agree with the main point -- that there is no shame in his mental state.  I suppose my point is that it is not necessary (and should not be necessary) to reclassify what a disease is in order for a class of people to maintain their dignity.  And above all, I wish this man well and by no means mean to diminish his pain, or the courage it took to write this.",1396032895

Kelvin Stott on March 28, 2014 11:57 AM writes...<p>I did my PhD on the molecular mechanism of HD with Nobel laureate Max Perutz back in 1993-6. We were trying to testing his &quot;polar zipper&quot; hypothesis, whereby expanded glutamine repeats aggregate into extended b-sheets that are inherently toxic, much like other amyoid-related diseases. And in fact, the mutant protein has been shown to form non-specific pores in cell membranes, just like other amyloid proteins.<p>That was many years ago, but anyway, I&#x27;d still like to share my perspective on this...<p>The problem I see with the mechanism proposed in this Nature paper is seems too specific for HD and huntingtin, however at least SEVEN other neurodegenerative diseases (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, DRPLA, Kennedy&#x27;s Disease, SBMA, etc.) have been linked to the expansion of glutamine repeats in completely unrelated proteins.<p>To me this is just too much of a coincidence for each disease to be explained by a different mechanism, and I think any mechanism for HD must be shown to occur in all these other diseases before I would be prepared to believe it.<p>Just my 2c.&quot;",1396032782

They have no power, must do what they&#x27;re told, and rarely get the chance to freely commit to anything.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much wrong with de-prioritizing an unfree commitment (especially if the delivery is only 2 weeks later rather than &quot;not made&quot;). The failure is on the people who created that context. Software companies especially need to understand that subordinate work will generally be of 1/10 the quality of work that people freely elect because it suits their vision, career goals, or intellectual interests. (A large part of the &quot;10x&quot; effect is motivation.)<p>Knowing myself, I don&#x27;t freely commit to things unless I&#x27;m 100% (or, to be honest about it, more like 99.5%) sure I can deliver.

This full inventory is referred to as the Enterprise Data Inventory (EDI) while the portion of that covering anything that should legally be public is called the Public Data Listing (PDL). Every agency subject to this law is required to post their public listing in a standardized json file at the root of their agency website. The PDL is not only meant to point to datasets that are already publicly available, but it also requires agencies to list datasets that should be public, but have not yet been released or are not yet online. The datasets that are not legally meant to be public must be included in the EDI, but it&#x27;s up to the discretion of the agency whether they want to list any in their public PDL. Some agencies have been doing that though. Otherwise, the full EDI with an accounting of all non-public datasets will really only be overseen by the White House Office of Manage and Budget and it&#x27;s up to them to determine what kind of information they&#x27;ll release about the EDI&#x27;s they receive from agencies.<p>As agencies continue to release their Public Data Listings you should be able to find metrics about this at <a href=""https://www.data.gov/metrics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.data.gov/metrics</a> In the future that site should also include metrics like the number of unreleased datasets listed in their PDL data.json file.",1396032115

These are all knee-jerk reactions, and they are unwarranted. Carmack himself says not to worry[0] about the Facebook acquisition, and I trust him.<p>Considering that Oculus VR is hiring industry veterans like Abrash, Carmack, Forsynth, Binstock, et al. I&#x27;d expect them to be even more focused. These are all people that have worked on big projects, some of which have failed (Abrash and Forsynth worked on the failed Intel project Larrabee, for example) and some of which have been quite successful (Carmack&#x27;s tremendous history with graphics engines, the working VR prototype from Valve). They are focused and you can see from this blog post/announcement that they are extremely excited about the project.<p>Another thing is, Sony&#x27;s Morpheus, at least right now, will work only on the PS4. The PS4&#x27;s hardware will be &quot;outdated&quot; by the time the Morpheus is released, if it isn&#x27;t already. The Rift provides more freedom to the developers from what we&#x27;ve seen, and given the history of the Oculus VR employees, with their openness about their goals and projects, it&#x27;s going to be more favorable for the developers in the long run than working with Sony&#x27;s closed system.<p>[0] <a href=""https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/449598224156745729"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/449598224156745729</a>",1396032087

7489128,comment,7488479,7488479,17,0,pyduan,,,"This is a courageous article.<p>Sadly, it seems mental illnesses are one of the great taboos of today (and don&#x27;t even get me started on the state of mental health care in the US). Similarly, mental illnesses are extremely misunderstood, and people tend to distrust people who suffer from one even though illnesses such as depression may affect 5 to 10% of the population [1] and as much as one in four adults are affected by a mental illness in general in a given year [2]. A significant portion of the population is affected, but for the most part it remains unadvisable to talk about it. It&#x27;s the elephant in the room.<p>This is compounded by the fact American culture in particular tends to disproportionately value extroversion and appearance of happiness. This leads many people to remain closeted by fear of repercussions, both on one&#x27;s social and work life. Even worse, it prevents people from seeking necessary help because of the attached stigma (&quot;but I&#x27;m not crazy!&quot;). There are known cases where people are punished for having seeked professional help. For exemple, people who admitted to &quot;suicidal tendencies&quot;, however serious, may be refused US visas [3]. The discrepancy between how willingly people talk about their trip to a doctor vs. a therapist is huge and obvious, and it shouldn&#x27;t be.<p>Now why should this be relevant for the HN crowd? As someone who&#x27;s very close to these issues, it seems to me this is one of the few social issues where the tech industry is not as progressive as it could be. Our industry tends to produce myths of super(wo)men with alpha personalities; we admire leaders, disrupters, bigger-than-life personalities, sometimes even assholes. Furthermore, this is a small world where, for better or for worse, a lot depends on word-of-mouth and personal reputation, and where &quot;cultural fit&quot; is openly hailed as a criterion for employment despite the vagueness of the term, which can hide what would otherwise be considered blatant discrimination (cf. that article on ageism not so long ago). The same goes for founders: would you think twice about investing in a non-established individual with a history of OCD? Depression?<p>What I am getting at is that mental illness is a combination of neurobiological and psychological causes, not a weakness in character -- but in an industry that values strength of character above everything else, the fact many ignore this can be extremely destructive.<p>We can do better. The author has done the world a great service by publishing his story.

7489041,comment,7488479,7488479,18,0,michaelochurch,,,"Cyclothymic. That&#x27;s a bipolar spectrum disorder, but it doesn&#x27;t match the lay image of the manic-depressive. The episodes are milder and shorter, but they come on quickly. A &quot;depression attack&quot; can last 3 hours, resolve in a panic attack, and be gone 20 minutes later. Most people who know me wouldn&#x27;t know that I have it. The one &quot;insane&quot; thing I&#x27;ve done (trolling, back in the day) had the specific purpose of keeping insanity out of my &quot;IRL&quot; existence.<p>As with all spectrum disorders, people seem to focus on the visible, uncontainable, and publicly dangerous 0.1% and ignore that 99.9% of people with the disorder or &quot;on the spectrum&quot; are not dangerous, wouldn&#x27;t fit most people&#x27;s image of &quot;mentally ill&quot;, and can be very well-adjusted.<p>I tend to think of mood disorders as anti-psychopathy. Psychopaths have low or nonexistent mood and emotional sensitivity, which is why they&#x27;re social high performers and (if ambitious) excel in the work world. Some mood disorders seem to be uncorrelated to context (i.e. episodes happen &quot;for no reason&quot;) and that&#x27;s probably more true of the severe cases, but <i>most</i> people with mood disorders are normal people with hypersensitivity, such as the OP whose brain would take personal criticism extremely seriously, unable to block it out or cope.<p>Aaron Swartz comes to mind as a archetypical anti-psychopath. They tend to be moralistic, less fearful of negative consequences when doing what they think is right, and prone to mood and anxiety disorders. Anti-psychopathy isn&#x27;t a desirable thing. It can be just as ill-adjusted. Just as psychopathy tends to be good for the individual (in terms of material prosperity, social rank, and sexual access) but bad for society, anti-psychopathy tends to be good for society but harmful to the individual.<p>What&#x27;s happening right now, in Silicon Valley, is a battle to the death between real technologists (who tend to be <i>anti</i>-psychopaths) and the mainstream business culture of entitled executives and board-whores (psychopaths). With Snapchat and Clinkle setting the tone in the current Valley, rents becoming unaffordable, and no-poach agreements all over the Valley, psychopaths seem to be winning.<p>I think that mood disorders in particular require a certain balance. People tend to do unwise or harmful things, especially when inexperienced, and those with mood disorders are not exceptions. You have to own your actions, even if you made them in a struggle that most people wouldn&#x27;t understand. That said, it&#x27;s also important to realize &quot;it&#x27;s not me, it&#x27;s them&quot; and keep your pride intact. Mental health issues often give you a front-row seat for how shitty people can be when they think you&#x27;re weak.<p>Much of what comes out of these disorders isn&#x27;t harmful in the least. It&#x27;s just slightly embarrassing, but plenty of people will hang you out to dry just because they&#x27;re weak, useless cowards. This may be why people with mood disorders (at least, the milder kind that won&#x27;t interfere with ethical behavior; a truly &quot;manic&quot; person, noting that mania-- not the milder hypomania-- is very rare even in people with bipolar, does not know who he is) tend to evolve into moralistic, hyper-ethical anti-psychopaths.<p>I&#x27;ll give a semi-fictional example. Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re a programmer and you have a hypomanic episode. You still go to work, don&#x27;t cause any issues, and spend 2 weeks building something you were never assigned to do. It turns out to be really good work and useful to the company (as much, or moreso, than putting that time in on your assigned work) but your boss is pissed off that you were working on this side project, instead of your assigned work, and tags you as &quot;unreliable&quot;. A morally decent person would recognize that as wrong (it&#x27;s health discrimination, and counterproductive, to punish people with &quot;creative flare-ups&quot;) but, even still, stories like that are so common in Silicon Valley as to be unremarkable. Anti-psychopaths tend to need an R&D environment where they&#x27;re measured by performance over time, rather than minute-by-minute superficial reliability (at which they can&#x27;t possibly compete) and those, sadly, tend to be turning rare in the current anti-intellectual (and pro-psychopathic) environment.",1396031159

That solution requires something more general purpose to glue domains together, which is the crux of the problem. What does such a language look like? How do you ensure you don&#x27;t lose all the good properties you gain from the domain specific languages/editors when passing between them?<p>I think you present a false dichotomy though. General purpose languages are just as much about encoding a process. The distinction between compiling to the machine vs some abstract machine also isn&#x27;t really relevant: this is about semantics, not implementation. And if you let implementation dictate the semantics you won&#x27;t get very far from where we are now.<p>> What I strongly disagree with is claiming that the complexities that plague general purpose languages are somehow mitigated by building more domain specific languages.<p>I never said that :) I said that programming would be greatly improved by being observable, direct, and incidentally simple. And again those have nothing to do with what &quot;level&quot; you&#x27;re programming at, they&#x27;re just principles to apply. I do think there is a general solution that can encompass most of the levels (though I&#x27;m not interested in trying to do that any time soon), but there is a common case here and it certainly isn&#x27;t high level theorem proving or embedded systems. It&#x27;s stupidly simple automation tasks, or forms over data apps, or business workflows. The world works on poorly written excel spreadsheets and balls of Java mud.

I cannot envision a live system that would allow me to debug those systems very well, which is not to say current tools couldn&#x27;t be improved upon.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve noticed working with embedded ARM systems is that we now have instruction and sometimes data trace debuggers that let us rewind the execution of a buggy program to some extent. The debugger workstations are an order of magnitude more powerful than the observed system so we can do amazing things with our trace probes.

7488905,comment,7486561,7487304,2,0,squigs25,,,"TO answer everyone&#x27;s questions below, think about the following example:<p>You have one car that&#x27;s 1,000 lbs and one that&#x27;s 10,000 lbs. When you start each car, it will take a lot more energy to bring the 10k lb car up to the same speed as the 1k lb car, but after that, the effects of drag will weigh more heavily on the lighter car (F=ma, so the rate of deacceleration is a lot higher for a smaller mass), causing constant fluctuations in the motor shutting on and off.<p>With the the 10k car, the transitions would take much longer. The time in between accelerations would be longer, and the motor would be on for longer spurts. You gain a great deal of efficiency for simply leaving a mechanical system running vs constantly modulating a mechanical system (i.e. shutting it on and off).<p>This would work in favor of the heavy car being more efficient.<p>Of course, the heavier your car is the worse your 0-60 split would be, so for a performance car that&#x27;s a negative.<p>Also, the heavier car would experience greater bearing resistance + friction. This is really difficult to quantify, and my gut is that it&#x27;s outweighed by the momentum advantage.<p>But overall, for a car that ways 2k lbs, a 5% increase in mass is pretty negligible, especially for casual highway and local driving.",1396029752

7488902,comment,7485673,7487542,2,0,nostrademons,,,"Therapy can help a lot for these problems.  Therapists are trained to recognize unconscious reactions of their clients and then bring those reactions into consciousness, so they can be dealt with by the client.<p>If you want to do it yourself (not recommended), the first step is usually to notice patterns in your behavior - <i>what</i> do you try to avoid, when do you fall into addictions, etc.  Also compare that to what other successful people do - do you find that some things are trivial and no big deal to other people, but cause you to turn into a blubbering mess?  You&#x27;re looking for intense anxiety here, which is why this is so difficult to do yourself - most people instinctively shy away from things that make them anxious, but here you have to deliberately seek them out.<p>Then, once you&#x27;ve got a clue to where the problem might be, you&#x27;re looking for a thought that seems to skitter away every time you think of it.  For example, I had an issue with needing to be certain about everything, and everything needing to be cut & dried facts.  The idea that I may not be perfect, that there were some things I didn&#x27;t know and never would know, was completely anathema to me.  So every time I found myself in such a situation, I&#x27;d immediately try to force certainty, either by learning as much as I could and jumping to a conclusion, or by avoiding the situation entirely.  When I tried to hold the idea of not being perfect in my head, my psyche would rebel, and thoughts would pop into my head like &quot;That&#x27;s for weaker minds.  I wouldn&#x27;t be <i>myself</i> if I didn&#x27;t know everything.&quot;<p>Once you&#x27;ve got the thought that always tries to skitter away, <i>hold onto it</i> and face it directly, no matter how much your consciousness rebels.  Usually they&#x27;ll be some sort of intense emotional reaction - you&#x27;ll start crying, or you&#x27;ll want to punch something, or you&#x27;ll feel like your life is ending.  That&#x27;s why movie dramas (eg. Good Will Hunting) often have some teary scene at the therapist&#x27;s office.  Naturally, you will probably want to be in a safe, private place for this.<p>You&#x27;ll want to hold onto that thought until you feel completely spent - it doesn&#x27;t actually take long once you&#x27;ve IDed the issue (20 minutes to an hour is my experience), but it&#x27;s exhausting.  You should feel &quot;lighter&quot; afterwards though, like your body has been through rough exercise but your mind is freer and no longer weighed down by whatever was troubling you.<p>Good luck.  It&#x27;s much easier with a trained therapist - or actually, I wouldn&#x27;t say easier in the sense of &quot;less painful&quot;, but you spin your wheels less on false theories about why you are the way that you are.",1396029706

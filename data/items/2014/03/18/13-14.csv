I don&#x27;t know what exactly you were expecting. Pictures of men dropping their pants? Because that&#x27;s not sexism; that&#x27;s sexual harassment. Sexism is an atmosphere and a culture which she says she experienced. Please read up on what sexism is before placing yourself in the role of the lawyer for the defense. Just ask yourself this: were you displaying the same sort of skepticism in the Aaron Swartz case, or were you inclined to believe his accounts or the accounts of those close to him? If the answer is that you weren&#x27;t skeptical back then, then you&#x27;re displaying sexist behavior right now even if you don&#x27;t feel like you are or it&#x27;s not your intention.<p>When someone accuses you of sexism, then you are probably sexist even if you don&#x27;t see it, precisely because you <i>can&#x27;t</i> see it. It&#x27;s just like someone telling you you&#x27;ve got something stuck in your teeth. When someone tells you you&#x27;ve got something stuck in your teeth, you don&#x27;t assume they&#x27;re lying, but you go look in the mirror; if you don&#x27;t, you run the risk of looking stupid. Sexism is exactly the same: if someone tells you you&#x27;re sexist, you go look in the mirror long and hard. If you deny it, you just look stupid, because how do you deny something that you can&#x27;t see?",1395151153

The actual builds are in /nix/store (or /guix/store), and symlinked from whatever profile you want (you can have several).<p>It&#x27;s also gonna be pretty hard to screw up your computer too, since multiple versions of software can be installed without problems, and you can perform safe rollbacks. The store is read-only and shouldn&#x27;t be hard deleted by mortals anyway, but you should perform all the deletions through nix/guix.<p>The advantage of building an OS out of nix/guix is that you generally don&#x27;t want to perform any kind of change to a system which is not reproducible (ie, no &quot;hidden knowledge&quot; that went into configuring a system) - so that if your system does ever break due to some unforeseen circumstances, you have a declarative configuration of the system in its entirety before it broke, and you can rebuild the system in a few commands.<p>It&#x27;s probably worth abandoning the idea that applications (or symlinks) should go into /usr/bin or anywhere else - the need for symlinks exists mostly for compatibility, but from the POV of a package or configuration, you should only refer to a specific identity of a derivation in the store.<p>For example, if I wanted a shortcut of say, emacs on my desktop - I could have a &quot;desktop_icons.scm&quot; package in which I define them - and rather than pointing to some /usr/bin/emacs, I would point to some &quot;emacs&quot; variable (referring to a specific version) imported from the emacs package, and append the relative bin path. Then if I change the version &quot;emacs&quot; points to, the desktop icon will be updated too.",1395151116

Not all package management systems provide a means to have multiple versions of a package/runtime/what-have-you installed at the same time.  Often, this capability is there , but packages need to be specially crafted (unique names, etc.) for it to work.  See Debian&#x27;s various Ruby and Python runtime packages for example.<p>2.

As a user, I am trusting the distribution I use and it&#x27;s package maintainers. Package vetting, stability testing and signing are what I expect from my distribution.<p>For language specific package managers, those things would be nice, but completely unreasonable to expect. There is no trust involved, how can there be? Most package repositories have no vetting process, it&#x27;s publicly writeable.<p>For python, there is virtualenv. Packages are &quot;installed&quot; in their little environments with user privileges. For node, I personally have a dir in home for modules and then ln -s cli tools into ~/bin. Again, all with user privileges.<p>The crazy thing is, for some people there is no distinction. In fact, I noticed a trend in the node community in that they all give instructions to install their modules globally. Literally every single installation instructions I have seen for node cli tools have said the same thing, install globally.<p>This is pretty baffling. If you were on a Windows machine, would you download some random setup file from a public ftp and run it as administrator? I don&#x27;t know why an entire community (of power users and developers no less) seem to think it&#x27;s somehow acceptable practise.",1395150714

That is up to the platform&#x27;s package manager. If you do that, it&#x27;s not the tool but you who is being stupid. If this is a real problem for you, why are you putting the person who does this into sudoers on production machines - I assume or anyway hope it is not a real problem for you.<p>I have any number of command-line tools which depend on recent versions of things, and are not project-specific. I can install them under a prefix that is inside my $HOME.<p>Or when I make a project, I can make a sandbox where the tools get installed.<p>And I can deploy it in a sandbox, not haphazardly depending on system versions of everything.<p>None of these things I am doing to make my life as a developer manageable are harming your &quot;architecture&quot; (scripts to run package managers are architecture now?)<p>There are good use cases for platform packages. But every little thing should not be done with them. That adds up to a HUGE waste of time, with no real purpose.<p>When I make projects, I often need them to run against any number of different versions of things. But the most minimal requirement is to be able to use an actually-recent version of a dependency, where the platform you have dictated thinks recent means &quot;6 years old.&quot; Neither of these can I do with the existing platform packages. So you demand that I make platform packages for every little tool and dependency I may use. Then, everything I want to use has to run against exactly one set of versions. So you are actually asking me to make my own whole-platform upgrades, or never use recent packages. That&#x27;s not my job, it&#x27;s not a sane way for me to do my job, and it actually doesn&#x27;t benefit you at all. It reflects a really profound lack of understanding not only of my job, but actually also of your own job.<p>Then as an author of a library or tool I made available for free, you are demanding that to satisfy you I make packages for several different platforms, each with their own idiosyncrasies and versions of everything, and in fact that I package half the universe for each platform since most of them do not have recent versions of anything - or again only ever use 6 year old dependencies. All so that your job never has to go beyond running the One True Package Manager, whatever you think it is.<p>Then after all this unnecessary pain, your &quot;solution&quot; will require me to run an entire fresh VM for each new thing. Because you have stipulated that I have to dump all my dependencies for every project into one big sewer, it is guaranteed that there will be version conflicts.  This is amazingly stupid because the tools already exist to avoid it very easily and people are already using them. And on your side, all you have to complain about is vague bruises to your feelings because not everybody is using the One True Package Manager for every little thing.<p>There is such a thing as a business listening too much to system administrators, when these system administrators do not at all understand software development, because their motivation is to prevent change and have less to do rather than to facilitate development of the business. When you blast this complaint at the whole community, you are asking for time to stand still and for nobody to develop anything new in the entire community. ALL forward progress must halt in order for you to have less work. It&#x27;s not happening and it shouldn&#x27;t happen.<p>If you are paid to be a system administrator, please perform your function as a system administrator. Please resolve these problems within the framework of your own company&#x27;s division of labor. If you have to build packages for your production platform, I&#x27;m sorry but that&#x27;s probably part of your job. If you don&#x27;t like it, please whine to HR instead of whining to HN.<p>If you think it will be easy to make every language developer use the same package manager as every other language, it should be equally easy to make all the platforms use one package format instead of the arbitrary hell of different ones they are using now. That is going to be your best bet for actually making one true package manager. Good luck.",1395150255

Unfortunately, so are system package managers that are too cumbersome or can&#x27;t/don&#x27;t keep up with what&#x27;s going on in the faster-moving language communities.  This results in projects being packaged by people who don&#x27;t actually understand it, while the people who understand it don&#x27;t (and shouldn&#x27;t need to) understand the minutiae of how to package things for a particular platform.  This in turn causes far too frequent breakage.<p>What we really need is system package managers that can <i>cooperate</i> with their language-specific brethren to get info about packages under other managers&#x27; control, direct other managers to install something according to its own rules/methods, and so on.<p>&quot;Hey apt-get, please tell me the status of this Ruby package&quot;\n<<apt-get turns around and gets the info from gem>><p>&quot;Hey yum, please install this Go package&quot;\n<<yum turns around and tells go to do it>><p>The rules for how to talk to each language-specific package manager shouldn&#x27;t even need to be very complicated.

Establish the culture that breaking API changes without increments to the major number is a showstopper bug, and that will help.

7421658,comment,7421018,7421386,4,0,dasil003,,,"Well Rails is a solid full-stack framework that is fairly modular, and of course ruby is extremely flexible in the architectural choices it allows, so it&#x27;s very easy to take Rails in different directions by instituting your own conventions.  It&#x27;s probably easier to do this then to either pick a minimalist framework like Sinatra and build everything up from scratch, or find another language with a framework that suits your exact preferences.<p>I totally agree that Rails defaults hit a certain sweet spot.  Putting a bit of logic in the controllers is fine in most apps, ActiveRecord is intended to mix persistence and business logic because many models aren&#x27;t complex enough to merit separating them.  Starting with a Hexagonal approach may well be premature optimization.  I get it.<p>But lets be careful not to throw the baby out with the bath water.  Rails intelligent defaults do have a tendency to leave a vacuum for apps reaching a certain level of complexity.  That doesn&#x27;t mean Rails isn&#x27;t still useful, but just that it becomes inelegant when you don&#x27;t have any conventions to deal with this and start hacking ad-hoc solutions into your codebase.  I have a sneaking suspicion that partially this is inevitable in any living codebase, and that a complex system almost by definition can not be consistent and elegant since it is inevitably built over time under changing conditions.  But in any case, I think Rails is a perfectly good place to experiment with ideas for managing complexity in a sizable app.",1395148482

7421629,comment,7419553,7419859,3,0,nirvdrum,,,"Here&#x27;s a non-comprehensive list of issues I have with bundler.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think in many ways it&#x27;s a lot better than what we had before.  But I also don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s advanced much since its initial debut and think we can do better (and yes, I&#x27;ve tried on that front):<p>* You can&#x27;t override a dependency:<p>This may very well be an issue with rubygems, but I&#x27;d have hoped bundler adoption would have fixed it if that&#x27;s the case.  Since dependencies and their versions cannot be overridden, transitive dependency conflicts are a constant minefield.  The naive solution is to modify your gemspec to be overly permissive and I get pressure to do this frequently with gems I work on.  But, now I&#x27;m asserting that my gem works with some hypothetical dependency that hasn&#x27;t been release yet.  And I&#x27;ve watched that blow up many times.  Semantic versioning does not fix this.<p>* Dependencies can disappear on you:<p>Yanked gems irk me, but I appreciate their value in preventing the installation of an unwanted version when one isn&#x27;t specified.  However, it also explicitly blocks installation of a particular version, effectively ignoring the version specification in Gemfile.  I may be romanticizing things here, but I don&#x27;t recall ever seeing a non-SNAPSHOT published artifact being removed when I was working with maven or ivy.<p>What&#x27;s frustrating is the gem still exists, but not in the index.  I guess I would expect Bundler to realize I do want to install the version I&#x27;ve specified and fetch the file and do the installation.  Ultimate control in my dependency graph should rest with me, not the whim of an upstream developer.  I realize this is a rubygems.org thing, but it also strikes me as a solvable problem that many don&#x27;t see as a problem.  And it means that checking out historical copies of my app almost certainly will not run without changing the Gemfile(.lock), which seems like a core value in a dependency management tool.<p>In any event, you will only discover this when deploying to a machine that has come up since the gem was yanked.  Common staging server and CI strategies don&#x27;t catch this since it&#x27;s essentially a race condition in the gem ecosystem.  You simply won&#x27;t find out until your deploy fails.  It undermines any trust in the ecosystem and the only viable solutions are: 1) run your own gem server; 2) modify gemcutter to dismiss all yanks, or 3) vendor every gem your app uses.<p>* It has weird rules:<p><pre><code>  gem &#x27;x&#x27;, platform: :mri\n  gem &#x27;y&#x27;, platform: :jruby\n</code></pre>\nworks the way you&#x27;d expect, but<p><pre><code>  gem &#x27;z&#x27;, git: &#x27;whatever&#x27;, branch: &#x27;mri_compat&#x27;\n  gem &#x27;z&#x27;, git: &#x27;whatever&#x27;, branch: &#x27;jruby_compat&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nwill not.  Apparently the dependency graph can&#x27;t be resolved if the gem names aren&#x27;t unique.  The platform part isn&#x27;t taken into consideration from what I gather.  This made it really hard when I was trying to port some C ext. gems to a JRuby equivalent.<p>* It promotes bad practices:<p>This one is admittedly contentious, but given bundler was created basically for Rails 3 and Rails is the worst abuser, it&#x27;s also hard to divorce the two.  But requiring your entire dependency graph up front is just not a good idea.  It&#x27;s bad for performance and it&#x27;s bad for memory.  It&#x27;s why apps take 30s to boot.  Most non-trivial Rails apps I&#x27;ve come across are basically multi-tiered applications in a monolithic codebase.  That means fog is getting loaded in controllers and haml is getting loaded in Sidekiq jobs.  It&#x27;s just a very odd situation.  I&#x27;ve tried to defer loading, but this is a battle that&#x27;s hardly worth fighting because of railties.  Auditing every gem to see if it has a railtie is tiresome and invalidated as soon as a new version comes out.  If a gem has a railtie, it needs to be required at a very specific point in the Rails boot cycle, otherwise your app just won&#x27;t work the same.  Figuring out that difference will likely drive you insane.<p>Likewise, every new gem created from Bundler has a gemspec that shells out to git at least once.  So, if you have a dependency on a gem sourced from git in your Gemfile, you get to pay that cost on every app load.  And if you end up somehow getting different results on different machines, then you&#x27;re not really running the same thing, which seems odd to me for a dependency management tool.<p>* It&#x27;s slow:<p>Gem installation has gotten a lot faster since the early days.  And dependency resolution has gotten better as well.  So, I&#x27;m not saying no work is being done here, but it is still slow.  This is a complaint that is always levied at maven, too, so Bundler certainly isn&#x27;t unique in this regard and I&#x27;d argue it got faster in a much shorter timeframe than maven did, so that&#x27;s promising.<p>* It was designed for MRI:<p>This one may be unfair since I don&#x27;t use rbx, but bundler wasn&#x27;t really built with JRuby in mind.  &quot;bundle exec&quot; is used everywhere now and it forks a process.  Forking the JVM is anything but light.  The solution is to use binstubs, which avoid the forking.  But also means you can&#x27;t really use both JRuby and MRI in the same codebase.<p>I really hope that Cargo learns from some of the pitfalls of Bundler.  It seemed like Bundler didn&#x27;t really learn from the pitfalls of other package managers.  I wasn&#x27;t involved with any of the design decisions, so I certainly don&#x27;t want to say it was pulled together haphazardly.  But it also seemed to overlook problems that tools like maven had solved over the past decade.  I&#x27;m sure a fair bit of that had to do with the underlying rubygems system, but the distinction is also a bit moot from the user perspective.",1395148249

Your &quot;unless...&quot; clause is the key element.<p>As background, I fly a twin engine piston airplane that&#x27;s pressurized (Beech 58P). Different level of responsibility from a 777-ER (I have only 6 seats, including my own), but many of the same basic design principles apply.<p>My cabin is pressurized by air coming off the turbos (the turbos &quot;make&quot; higher than ambient pressure air, and that is fed into the cabin after passing through a restrictor and an intercooler). Turbines (jets and turbo-props) pressurize from bleed air (also high pressure air created in the engine, but via a different physical mechanism.)<p>If I have an engine or turbo failure, I need to be able to isolate the cabin from the smoke/fumes/fire that may be present on that engine. So, I have a red knob that can isolate the cabin from the feed from that side (and another knob that will isolate the other side).<p>Similarly, I have a cabin pressure controller, and on that a cabin dump switch. The controller controls a single outflow valve at the rear of the cabin, about the cross-section of a roll of toilet paper, and there is a second, spring-loaded valve of the same size that&#x27;s designed to automatically open if the cabin were at risk of over-pressurization.<p>It would be trivial for me to dump the cabin quickly with a single switch. This results in a cabin rate of climb of over 3K feet per minute, which is painful on the ears, and within minutes the cabin will climb to the aircraft altitude. (I test virtually all of the systems annually prior to the annual major maintenance event, such that if a system has failed, I can have it addressed during major maintenance.)<p>Why is there a dump switch at all? Dumping the cabin is a great way to clear the cabin of smoke, so in the event of an electrical fire or smoke, once the situation is contained, I can dump the cabin, venting all the toxic smoke inside to the outside, with a supply of &quot;clean&quot; higher-pressure air entering at the front. Once the smoke has cleared, I close the outflow valve to re-pressurize the cabin from the engines.<p>The point of this wall of text is that aircraft are designed assuming that someday something will fail. When it fails, the pilots, assumed to be the &quot;good guy&quot;, need to have the best chance possible to react.<p>All common, and many uncommon, failures have a specific checklist response, sometimes with initial items from memory. (With an engine on fire, you want to perform the initial response from memory, backing it up later with the written checklist.)<p>No plane is designed to protect the occupants from a pilot intent on killing everyone on board. The pilot has any number of ways to do that, so it&#x27;s counter-productive to prevent the 99.99% emergencies from being responded to by a well-intentioned pilot in order to prevent the occasional madman from killing all aboard.",1395147893

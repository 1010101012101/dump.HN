No one had heard of thunderbolt a year ago and now all of the sudden it's a necessity?<p>The large majority of consumers will probably be impressed by the next gen Mac. That is the direction the entire line will be heading in and Apple clearly wants to make the differentiation clear, instead of marginally different and making people indifferent between the NGMBP and MBP.<p>These are not just creative decisions, they're marketing decisions, and so far Schiller hasn't done much wrong.",1339498746

4099807,comment,4099587,4099677,1,0,doug363,,,"I get the impression that state laws are significantly more uniform in Australia than the US... IMHO, it's more that distributors are ""used to"" a lower AUD, have exclusivity/best price guarantees, and so can prevent anyone importing goods (at retail scale) that undercuts them. They've got their business model worked out on the basis of higher prices, their customers are used to higher prices, and they make arguments like ""hey, well, we ran a bit of an advertising campaign and submitted your product for regulatory approval"". Perhaps true, but not necessarily worth the extra ""tax"". See the story about how the digital price for Australian buyers of The Witcher 2 got increased because the Australian distributor made a fuss: <a href=""http://www.kotaku.com.au/2011/05/why-does-the-witcher-2-cost-more-in-australia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kotaku.com.au/2011/05/why-does-the-witcher-2-cost...</a>",1339498522

I actually have a roomy desktop case, a Lian Li, a passive GFX card, an energy efficient CPU and only one big CPU fan, and a pretty silent energy efficient PSU.  These were all picked with noise in mind when I last built my desktop PC.  My case actually is pretty thin alu, it resonates because of the hard drive and thin chassis, so I've had to tediously dampen the drives with rubber (I wouldn't recommend that case.)  Some of the older cases - I'm talking a naughties case, can be found (probably at the local tip) that are incredibly thick, and these make for a better quieter unit in my opinion - but at the same time they can be quite ugly.  But then again - most PCs are ugly!<p>A friend of mine just picked up a Pentium 4 (yes all my friends have P4s), for 20, with a nice thick case, but the thing sounded like a helicopter taking off - the fans were so loud.  We replaced the CPU fan (something like an Arctic freezer), and now it's quite easy on the ears.<p>My PC case is hugely bloated for my needs, I barely touch the DVD unit anymore, so I could just throw it in a trunk.  Or make a new chassis for it.  I only keep it as the size doesn't make me curse whenever I have to go in there.  How about a piano stool for a case?<p>I think my favourite case I ever had was a micro ATX case that I modded to accommodate the PSU on the front.

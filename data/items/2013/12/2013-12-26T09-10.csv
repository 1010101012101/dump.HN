6965802,comment,6965263,6965760,1,0,richardburton,,,"Correct! That was not clear. I hope you&#x27;ll forgive the transgression as I&#x27;m juggling a few forms of communication at the moment--this HN submission came out of the blue.<p>I completely understand your perspective. The problem for companies who want to recruit great people is that most of them aren&#x27;t looking for new a job (several studies put the percentage at around 80%). Therefore, companies are forced to reach out to those people to pique their interest. There&#x27;s a subset of great companies who take the time to craft personalized, relevant emails to these people; there are some who even get their engineers to write the initial email. We want to work with these kinds of companies.",1388051985

6965776,comment,6965295,6965295,18,0,grownseed,,,"I worked with this guy for quite a while who I used to supervise as a developer, being a bit tired of his incompetence but seeing that he still had an interest in helping out, he and I suggested to my bosses that he be reassigned to a position that might fit his profile a bit better. Shortly after, the guy was made systems architect, without my prior knowledge (I was still in charge of devs). I pointed out that while a less hands-on position might be better suited, what he was doing clearly had nothing to do with being a systems architect (in no small part because I was the one taking care of that, if given the time).<p>My bosses and said guy agreed and decided to make him a &quot;business systems analyst&quot;. As of today I&#x27;m still not completely sure what that position entails. The basic idea, I was told, was that he would discuss and gather requirements from clients, then turn them into a useful set of documents and clear explanations. And this is where this article particularly hit the nail.<p>Not once did this &quot;business systems analyst&quot; produce a valuable document. While he was attending meeting after meeting, going to conferences around the globe to supposedly learn about products he had literally no technical knowledge of, I wondered more and more what his value to the company might have been. He essentially created, with my bosses&#x27; blessing and encouragement, a whole confusing layer in the development process.<p>He made a lot of noise, produced extremely confusing (and poorly written) documents turning basic client requirements into any developer&#x27;s worst nightmare, readily passing the blame around without ever putting his position in the balance. Missed deadlines would be the PM&#x27;s fault, an incorrect feature would be a developer&#x27;s mistake, a misunderstood requirement would be the client&#x27;s fault, and the list goes on. Each and every single project he touches simply becomes an absolute bane, but the amount of fuss generated through useless emails, delayed replies and inconsequential yet time-consuming nitpicking, has my bosses falling head over heels for him.<p>Long story short, four valuable people (including myself) have left the company, and the guy is now &quot;business systems director&quot; (I did not make this up) and is on the board.

Sales usually want the feature they need for their current customer - fair game (product management must prioritize for the greater good), and they would like the features to be implemented well.\nOf course their job doesn&#x27;t scale that well, but they are still very important for major contracts.<p>Maybe if your sales team is not working this way, you should consider a new employer, the same way many are advocating when the engineering team is broken.

I&#x27;ve also read many of Graham and Wagner&#x27;s papers on their tooling, and you know what....<p>>  This is an area where i&#x27;d read a lot more than i&#x27;d sit down and code, because a lot of smart people have been this way before.<p>...it turns out we can do much better than what they did given per language consideration. Once I decided not to use Harmonia for the Scala IDE, I came up with a way to incrementalize Martin&#x27;s compiler fairly easily. It wasn&#x27;t that hard in hindsight, but none of those fancy algorithms were really necessary at all! Instead, we just needed an incremental computation framework like Glitch [1] to do the heavy lifting transparently, which eventually led to my work in live programming.<p>So the moral of this story: don&#x27;t trust everything you read from an academic conference. Often work is incomplete, not appropriate for your context, outdated, or even unworkable. Usually, its incomplete and there is lots of room for improvement.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=201333\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=2013...</a>",1388050131

The usual FRP programs are written so that you first define a few primitive signals (I use the term signal for the sake of this thread being about Elm) and then use them together with a set of combinators to build up a entire signal network that defines the program. In Elm you already have the primitives and then just step state like you would do in a FP language normally.<p>Elm is theoretically classic FRP with a option of a arrow interface, but the combinators for building signal networks is not provided by defult.

6965739,comment,6965295,6965520,4,0,kamaal,,,"Remember these days cheating is called &#x27;Smart Work&#x27;! People who work hard are considered fools, who inevitably do all the work for some one who can exploit their work to his/her benefit. In our society financial worth is the sole measure of success, and unless you get caught doing something illegal the more manipulative you are, the more you are considered smart.<p>Unfortunately if you take a real hard look at it, much of that is true. I know great programmers who do great work, only to find some one at the top levels take all the credit, and make the programmer look like a replaceable cog in the wheel. Fat bonuses, promotions, foreign travel, big pay slips et al are taken for things like &#x27;nurturing innovation&#x27;, &#x27;demonstration of leadership&#x27; which is basically making somebody else to the job, while not moving a finger towards the goal yourself, then just blanket claiming the credit for the all work and in the meanwhile making it look like it would have been impossible for anything to get done in their absence.<p>There is an entire mass populace of people that makes fortunes doing things this way. And such people as I said are considered &#x27;smart&#x27;.<p>In many ways I feel Ayn Rand said was very right. The progress of the world depends on a select few prime movers, then there is always a crowd which makes it big by merely begging, cheating, leeching, stealing and sycophancy.",1388049966

Do I want to continue programming what I am told when I am 40? I find out that programming is sometimes frustrating depending on the motivations of your coworkers as well...<p>You may be considering you will be a &quot;manager&quot; in the future but I do think that only a bunch of today programmers will be managers or CTO in the future (a lot of politics in Spain). Somehow there are some people that are meant to be CTO no matter they age or experience, so don&#x27;t trust you will be one.<p>So I started to think what do I wanted to do with my life. I considered two options: \n- Helping make the world nicer by learning the secrets of design: my mother and brothers are artists and I consider I have some potential, I have done some freelancing regarding this topic.\n- Helping the IT world to be more secure in an useful way: I was kind of a hacker in my teen years and I loved it but I started to work as a developer and I lost this track.<p>Long story short, I studied a MSc in Information Security and now I am helping the enterprise where I was a programmer to build useful security. The good things about the security world is that: is an art, is quite challenging, it involves working with people, is a growing industry, you can program from time to time and... It is cool! =D<p>I continue programming but as a hobby and I find it much more rewarding.<p>(Any grammar corrections are appreciated since English it&#x27;s not my mother tongue).",1388049736

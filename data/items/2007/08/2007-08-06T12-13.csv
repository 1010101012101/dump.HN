In reality, I respect Paul immensely, and it was for this fact that I felt strongly enough that I had to comment. As for the title, I was simply matching one sensationalist title with another. (Note that the title of neither article was actually representative of its real argument.)<p>Secondly, although many wish it (sometimes myself included), Microsoft is not dead nor dying. My core argument is that if Paul wanted to say that entrepreneurs shouldn't fear Microsoft, then so be it; his point would have been much stronger and well-stated. I also would have agreed with him... no one should be afraid of Microsoft, they're just a company.<p>Instead, he said things like ""no one uses Windows"" and ""everyone can see the desktop is over"" and completely undermined his own credibility.<p>Anyhow, as I said in another comment, it was just meant as a rant, and I'm surprised the post has gotten as much interest as it has. I still stand by what I said, but I probably could have toned down the sensationalism a bit. :)<p>Thanks for visiting and commenting; it's very good to get the opposing view. I wish you could have read the 30-odd comments that were left, most in agreement, before I switched back to Wordpress and nuked them... :/",1186405183

How much earlier could I get up if I go to sleep earlier, and how does that time's productivity compare to now?<p>This translates to: if I'm tired I go to sleep.

39752,comment,39747,39747,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Not trusting ""unproven"" people in a startup can be a far bigger mistake, however.  If you don't trust your employees, they'll quickly fall back into the ""Okay, it's a bureacracy, I'll do the minimum amount of work and collect a paycheck"" mode.  Or they'll leave.  Because there's little else they can do if you don't trust them.<p>Instead, you should trust them, but always have contingency plans (which you don't tell them!) for what to do if they don't perform.  You probably need those contingency plans even if you're doing the work yourself or have hired the best developers on earth.  After all, nearly every software project takes 3 times as long as you expect (even when you account for Hofstadter's Law ;-)), and some things just plain aren't feasible.",1186403880

Sleep will catch up to you and you end up wasting more time by sleeping at odd hours to make up for the sleep debt created by not sleeping enough.<p>Recently, I read this article that says humans just need 2hrs of sleep, sounds interesting, here's the link to it <a href=""http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,774680,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,774680,00.h...</a>",1186401677

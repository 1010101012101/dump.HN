The significance of the battle was that the Americans secured Phillipine Sea against Japanese shipping and this cut the Japanese off from the oil fields in Indonesia in terms of transporting oil back home.  it was only after Leyte Gulf that organized kamikaze attacks began, and the Navy was largely put out of the war by that battle.<p>What that means is that Japan lost WWII when they lost access to oil.  So the issue with naval ships is diesel or nuclear.  About 1/3 of the US navy is nuclear-powered.  The rest runs on diesel.  Thats enough our navy (but not our air force, army etc) can continue to run if oil is not available for a time.  Our military is still very dependent on oil but not like the Japanese were.",1393825505

The test still passes even if thisShouldThrowFooBarException doesn&#x27;t throw an exception.

At a time when Microsoft is increasingly forward-thinking in the clarity and tastefulness of its UI and UX, Samsung just can&#x27;t stop throwing glossy plastic, pleather, knock-off iOS 6 icons, random fonts and gimmick apps around.

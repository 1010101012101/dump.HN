What makes Go faster are a few things: (1) C++ headers contain templates, which are slot to compile; (2) Go only looks at direct imports and uses the compiled form of those imports, rather than recursing over their imports (again); (3) Go is simpler to parse; and (4) there is no overloading, so symbol/method resolving is simpler.<p>I also think that the advantage is often overstated. C++ is a nightmare in this respect, C programs and libraries often compile very fast (on my current machines, running configure often takes much more time than the actual compilation), the same applies to e.g. Java code.<p><i>That's really helpful when refactoring,</i><p>And annoying for testing, the printf example has been beaten to death. (Yes, I know that you can add a line such as <i>var use = fmt.Println</i>).<p><i>But for those of us who don't trust our human brains as much and want to be absolutely sure that these silly errors don't slip through</i><p>It's always surprising how Go fans can sell a feature that any strong statically typed language always had (easy refactoring by letting the type system work) can sell as something unique and new ;).",1361606346

HN deals with your interaction by assigning a session index to your initial contact.<p>2. This index allows HN to keep track of which page of which section you're visiting, so if you click ""More"" the HN sever knows what do to -- it has a stored context for your request.<p>3. The HN server has limited resources, so if an index goes unused for more than a few minutes, the server reclaims the index for reuse.<p>4. If you wait too long before making a server request like clicking ""More"", it's possible that your index will have been reclaimed and assigned to another user. If this happens, you see the ""expired link"" message.<p>5. After your index has expired and been reclaimed, the HN server has no way to interpret your command to proceed -- proceed to where?<p>6. Also, if you wait long enough, the front page (and all subsidiary pages) will have changed contents, so the pages you're viewing are no longer current, consequently the server can't deliver ""page 2"" for the simple reason that that version of the page no longer exists.",1361606290

On LTO the U.S. scores 29, Deutschland 31, and China 118. Respondents in ""high-LTO countries"" are pragmatic, believing ""less in universal guidelines about what is good and evil and more in considering the circumstances"" [2]. LTO was the only cultural dimension found to predict per capita economic growth.<p>The pragmatism probably arises, in part, from the interaction with another cultural dimension: uncertainty avoidance. UAI is ""the extent to which the members of a culture feel threatened by ambiguous or unknown situations and have created beliefs and institutions that try to avoid these"". Uncertainty-avoidance cultures tend to believe that ""there is only one Truth and we have it. All others are wrong."" On UAI the U.S. scores 46, Deutschland 65, and China 30. While China was shifting from communism to state capitalism Deng Xiaoping asked ""what does the color of the cat matter as long as it catches mice?""<p>Marieke de Mooij found in a 2002 study [3] that LTO cultures ""are cash or debit card cultures, not credit card cultures"". They also prefer real estate over mutual funds. Interestingly, ""a long-term orientation suggests less receptivity to e-commerce"" because of a reduced ""willingness to pay for convenience"".<p>As an aside regarding cultural blinders, LTO was not detected in Geert Hofstede's original 1981 research. It took the Chinese Values Survey ""questionnaire, designed by Eastern minds,"" which, in turn, ""did not detect the uncertainty avoidance dimension"" to discover LTO [2].

An interesting task?  Perhaps.  But not reflection of the dev's skills, per se.<p>You're not asking about syntax with this. It's a problem solving question and at the end of the day, the only real metric here is not whether a dev could code this up, but whether he can code it up quickly, under time constraints, while being stared at, under pressure, with rent or a mortgage on the line, and maybe kids to feed.<p>I am hard pressed to think of even <i>one</i> real life dev task I had in my entire career where I had to solve a problem under those circumstances.  For most devs, we take ownership of the problem and solve it at our desk under reasonable time frames without the spotlight. For bigger problems, we might think about it in the car on the way home.  We might sleep on it over the weekend.<p>That doesn't apply to reversing a string, of course.  But you have to consider that, depending on the dev's background and skills, he may be spending time in jQuery, maybe Spring and Hibernate (for Java guys), maybe even some CSS.  Maybe he's a GWT guy?  Maybe he was assigned to a team dedicated to (God forbid) EJBs. In other words, he may be multifaceted and spends more time working with an API than ""just"" raw language coding. The language is just a means for working with the API.<p>And the one thing you want to measure is not something he does daily.  Now, if he can't use a for loop, feel free to mock him.  But reversing a string? That's clearly a puzzle.<p>EDIT:  I can't get this part out of my mind:

I interview for myself or others more than 100 people (of any background, including university, tech schols...) and I think only 10/12 people do it correctly - barely-""<p>So you continue to use that question? Despite the results?  So that when you do hire a guy that passes, he won't ever do this on the job because you know you damn well he should use the reverse() method?

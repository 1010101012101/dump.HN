The prisoner can petition for parole every year during forvaring, but there is no limit to the possibility of extension, so forvaring effectively allows for life in prison.",1379444359

6401152,comment,6400455,6400455,11,0,lpolovets,,,"There&#x27;s a lot of great advice in this post, and much of it rings true. Specifically, the following tidbits are true ~100% of the time in my limited experience:<p>- &quot;Investors will try to lure you into fundraising when you&#x27;re not. It&#x27;s great for them if they can, because they can thereby get a shot at you before everyone else.&quot;<p>- &quot;What investors would like to do, if they could, is wait. When a startup is only a few months old, every week that passes gives you significantly more information about them.&quot;<p>- &quot;Though you can focus on different plans when talking to different types of investors, you should on the whole err on the side of underestimating the amount you hope to raise.&quot;<p>- &quot;You will be in a much stronger position if your collection of plans includes one for raising zero dollarsi.e. if you can make it to profitability without raising any additional money.&quot;<p>- &quot;If you have multiple founders, pick one to handle fundraising so the other(s) can keep working on the company.&quot;<p>- &quot;It&#x27;s a mistake to behave arrogantly to investors.&quot; (I also think it&#x27;s a mistake for investors to behave arrogantly to founders)<p>That said, I wanted to comment on a few of the other points in this (awesome) essay:<p><i>&quot;To founders, the behavior of investors is often opaquepartly because their motivations are obscure, but partly because they deliberately mislead you.&quot;</i><p>That&#x27;s a strong statement. First, not all investors mislead -- many are honest people. Second, startups are also often guilty of misdirection, which doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t call out shitty investors, but I do think you should call out both sides instead of making one side sound like the bad guy.<p><i>&quot;Do you have to be introduced? In phase 2, yes.&quot;</i><p>I think this is true 95% of the time, but it&#x27;s not 100% true. My partners and I get pitch decks emailed to us by random people. Most of the time the pitch decks are subpar, but I think that&#x27;s because not being able to get a real intro is a sign that your team/idea/traction/something else is subpar. However, this is just a signal, and there is no rule - written or unwritten - that says &quot;if we don&#x27;t know the sender then the deck goes in the trash.&quot; If you email us something that falls within our thesis and looks promising, we&#x27;d love to talk to you.<p><i>&quot;Never leave a meeting with an investor without asking what happens next. What more do they need in order to decide?&quot;</i><p>This is great advice. Most founders we talk to already ask &quot;what&#x27;s next&quot; at the end of a meeting, but not all of them do.<p><i>&quot;And while most investors are influenced by how interested other investors are in you, there are some who have an explicit policy of only investing after other investors have. You can recognize this contemptible subspecies of investor because they often talk about &quot;leads.&quot;&quot;</i><p>I guess I&#x27;m one of the members of that contemptible subspecies. My partners and I are in the middle of raising a fund, but we were investing with our own money for the better part of this year. Our checks were too small to lead, but there were lots of startups that didn&#x27;t have terms. If you&#x27;re raising 1m on a 5m pre, then we don&#x27;t need a lead to invest. If you&#x27;re raising 1m-2m on a ??? pre, then we would prefer to wait to find out what ??? is. We&#x27;re not super valuation sensitive, so 7m vs 8m is fine, but there&#x27;s a big difference between a 6m pre and an 10m pre. What makes this more difficult is that founders will not reveal terms for obvious reasons. They can&#x27;t say, &quot;we&#x27;re going to be raising at a 6m-9m pre&quot; because that immediately shows that they would be willing to go to 6m. They may as well not mention 9m. So instead, they say something like, &quot;we&#x27;ll know terms once we get a lead.&quot; Okay, fine.. then we&#x27;ll wait for the lead. =)<p><i>&quot;Sometimes an investor will ask you to send them your deck and/or executive summary before they decide whether to meet with you. I wouldn&#x27;t do that. It&#x27;s a sign they&#x27;re not really interested.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m surprised by this advice. As an investor, it saves everyone a ton of time when I can look at a deck before a meeting. I will sit down for 15-45 minutes before a meeting,  go through deck, do some internet research, and think of questions I want to ask. This saves time because I can find out answers to the basic questions that I would ask in the deck, and then we can focus on more interesting questions and concerns during the meeting.",1379444324

6401150,comment,6399178,6399178,10,0,pitchups,,,"The &quot;tipping point&quot; theory popularized by Malcolm Gladwell&#x27;s book was proven to be too simplistic and flawed by Duncan Watts, a network researcher currently at Yahoo. His book &quot;Everything is Obvious - Once You Know the Answer&quot; debunks this popular misconception. He describes many studies, simulations and actual experiments that show that how fast something spreads virally has less to do with where it starts (influential groups/tipping point), than how susceptible a person is to being influenced (ie how infectious the idea is to begin with).

6401139,comment,6400175,6400496,6,0,VLM,,,"I would tentatively disagree with raising the bar and describe it using my favorite MySQL / PostGRES analogy that they have a fundamentally different philosophy but do about the same thing.<p>For example, if you want to do something software raid-ish, ZFS has the philosophy that should be done at the filesystem layer, not as a virtual device like every other linux filesystem, ever.  Its not a new feature to be able to do RAID, but its new to embed RAID into the filesystem layer itself.  Linux style virtual RAID devices don&#x27;t care if you build a FAT32 on top of /dev/md0.<p>There are other examples of the same philosophy in ZFS.  For example everywhere else in linux if you want some manner of &quot;volume manager&quot; you simply use LVM.  ZFS has its own interesting little volume manager.  Which relates to snapshots.<p>It&#x27;s exactly the same with encryption.  Every other implementation on linux uses a loop device and your choice of algo.  ZFS shoves all that inside the filesystem.<p>Another philosophical decision is every other linux filesystem doesn&#x27;t scrub, but only fsck&#x27;s metadata, so logically ZFS implements the exact opposite.<p>Although ZFS supporters are technically telling the truth when they run around saying only ZFS can provide software RAID, or only ZFS has a volume manager, and ext2/3/4 does not, its not relevant.  I&#x27;ve had LVM and software RAID and all that for many years on existing linux stuff.<p>One of the few true features ZFS provides is allowing ridiculously big filesystems.  Which is cool.<p>It is mostly a philosophical difference between modularity and monolithic design, with pretty much everything else being modular, and ZFS being extremely monolithic.<p>In that way I don&#x27;t think ZFS has prodded any innovation at all in any other filesystems other than maybe BTRS which I haven&#x27;t been following because my data is too valuable to experiment upon and filesystems aren&#x27;t my thing.  I don&#x27;t see the iso9660 FS driver adding native volume management, snapshotting, software RAID, and encryption any time soon.",1379444198

And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.</i><p>These aren&#x27;t universal, unqualified rules and I don&#x27;t understand why you&#x27;re trying to generalize them beyond fundraising.  To use a different and perhaps silly example, I&#x27;d be more inclined to trust my intuition with respect to dog kennels than, say, medical or legal advice.<p>I think pg is saying that fundraising is more like medical or legal advice and less like dog kennels.  He&#x27;s not making a blanket statement about trusting people with prior experience.<p>If you want to make this more mathy, imagine there some function<p><pre><code>    I(s) = amount I should trust my intuition in situation s
</code></pre>
pg is writing about what happens when &quot;s_1 = I&#x27;m fundraising for the first time,&quot; but you&#x27;re trying to rebut his point as if he were writing about what happens when &quot;s_2 = I&#x27;m talking to someone more experienced than myself.&quot;  There are three possibilities: pg believes I(s_1) = I(s_2), you&#x27;re misunderstanding pg, or pg is contradicting himself.<p>You&#x27;re arguing that since pg believes I(s_1) != I(s_2) (as evidenced by his previous writings) then pg must be contradicting himself.  The correct line of reasoning is actually &quot;If pg believes I(s_1) != I(s_2) then either pg is contradicting himself or I&#x27;m misunderstanding pg.&quot;<p>Given pg&#x27;s generally fastidious nature with respect to these things, I&#x27;d say the prior odds of pg contradicting himself are much lower than you simply misunderstanding him.  At the very least this is what most folks believe, so when you jump to the conclusion that pg is contradicting himself you come off as an uncharitable little troll.  First stop on the troll tour: Downvote City. :D<p>Putting on my teacher hat for a second, when you smell a contradiction like that it&#x27;s often a sign you&#x27;re misunderstanding something.  Rather than point out the apparent contradiction and go all <i>j&#x27;accuse</i> on the author, it&#x27;s more useful to stop and ask yourself, &quot;Assuming the author is intelligent enough to spot a contradiction like this, is there a way to understand what they wrote in a way that isn&#x27;t contradictory?&quot;<p>There&#x27;s really no downside to doing this, even if there is a contradiction.  At the very least you&#x27;ll have developed a more robust argument.  Often you&#x27;ll end up with a way to express the author&#x27;s argument more clearly than the author did in the first place, since you&#x27;re probably not the only one confused in the same way.  What&#x27;s more, if there actually is a contradiction, folks will be more inclined to believe you when you demonstrate you&#x27;ve gone out of your way to try to understand the author.",1379444092

6401011,comment,6398650,6400802,1,0,bitL,,,"Sorry, I didn&#x27;t mean to offend you in any way!<p>First, I really don&#x27;t like if somebody by default compares Hadoop with SQL and this is a widespread confusion - they are completely different beasts; in fact an extension called Hive gives Hadoop + HTable an SQL-like syntax.<p>However Hadoop is a parallel, batch-processing platform. Hadoop is slow-responding, you can&#x27;t even talk about latency because a single task takes a lot of time even to setup/execute. It&#x27;s completely inappropriate for real-time low-latency computations. For those, the in-memory, GPGPU, streams are much better. However, if you have a large dataset whose loading times onto a single machine may be very long - imagine loading 1TB to memory from a network drive if your computer can handle it - you might be better off by partitioning your data across thousands of smaller nodes (e.g. ARM microservers) and perform computations on each of them independently. This way you don&#x27;t need to transfer a lot of data, each smaller local dataset is loaded very fast (= you preserver locality), you find balance between being CPU-bound and IO-bound and likely finish your computations much faster than on a single computer with huge memory but limited bus.<p>Hadoop&#x27;s tragedy is that it is now an established platform that is supported by large companies which are mostly driven by technologically clueless people, trying to put it everywhere as it is &quot;in vogue&quot; to do so. Google abandoned MapReduce model a few years ago but industry didn&#x27;t seem to notice.<p>Think about your case for chemical structures - is there any part of your algorithm that needs to be computed only occasionally but it&#x27;s a lot of data to process? Why not offload it to Hadoop for preparing digest from these data which you can use in your real-time algorithm? That&#x27;s actually pretty common usage scenario - Hadoop handles the rough mining, extracting the precious stuff from crude data, assembling it to a form that is refined and can be used by other parts of system that have completely different requirements, for example low-latency interactions.",1379443107

Ask them how they&#x27;re doing on paying back those student loans.  Several people I went to highschool^ with are currently working as teachers (several more are still <i>looking</i> for teaching jobs.  The surplus of people looking to get into education certainly doesn&#x27;t help...).  While I had my student loans paid off quite some time ago, they are still floundering.  Although they love &#x27;their kids&#x27;, more than one has confided in me that they don&#x27;t know what the hell they were thinking.<p>Salary, specifically how it will enable them to pay back their loans, is the sort of thing that young people in university consider when they are decided whether they want to go into industry or education.  Total compensation doesn&#x27;t really enter the equation at that stage.<p>When the best and the brightest can get starting offers with a salary two or three times as high as starting teacher salaries, that is going to take a toll in the grand scheme of things.  You&#x27;ll still have a few very bright chaps (such as my highschool friends) who swallow the bullet and go into education anyway, but you cannot expect that to be typical.<p>^ We still talk a few times a year, and they are all closer with each other than any of them are with me.

And then present more challenging material to that group (relative to the other groups).<p>And I&#x27;m not talking about what we already have now - a few Advanced Placement classes, I&#x27;m talking about the entire education system being free to cater differently to A) students that want to learn and compete, B) students that need simpler material, and C) students that want to clown around.<p>Instead, we have a system that caters to the lowest-common-denominator (C) in the room at the expense of every other student.

I got my first computer 6 years ago, and within a year, I was obsessed with learning to build for the web. Shortly after, this obsession took me to a few online forums dedicated to development and other similar works. I built a crappy content management system for a game that I played occasionally, which was given to people who ran servers for that same game. Shortly after, I myself started a private server for that game, and developed a lot of interesting game mechanics and interactions that did not exist in the official game. This private server grew to be very popular and had about 3000 players online simultaneously at any given time of day. Soon after, this private server received a cease and desist order by the company that owned the game, and I pulled the plug.<p>During that time, I met my (future) co-founder through one of our players. We went on to co-found Windows7Center and Windows8Center.com (offline as of 2012), and over 3 years, gained quite a bit of success and popularity. During those few years, between these efforts and school, I took on freelance web development work to satisfy both my passion and my family&#x27;s monetary needs.<p>I then decided against taking my full scholarship to law school, and attended a local technical college for Computer Science. After finishing my 1st year in Computer Science, I left school to pursue full-time opportunities because of financial difficulties that arose. Up till now, I&#x27;ve been working full-time for close to 2 years.<p>When I found out Amazon was hiring in Vancouver, B.C, I applied. I was interested but I was not yet prepared to leave my job in the case of an offer. A few months later, I left the company I was in, and around the same time, was asked to participate in Amazon&#x27;s phone interviews. Throughout the process, they were aware that I had only completed 1 year of college.<p>My interview was with a senior engineer working in the same area I was applying for over in Seattle, and went quite well. Subsequently, I was flown down to Seattle for a full day of on-site interviews (for a Vancouver position). Long story short, the interviews went well, and after going through the 7 interviewers, my last interview was with the lead recruiter from Vancouver, who had flown down to interview me.<p>He then proceeded to spend the remaining 35~40 minutes drawing on the whiteboard the compensation details of the position, including signing bonus, equity options, performance bonus, how I could choose between more options or cash for the bonus, the benefits of choosing one over the other, the base salary, etc. He said &quot;when I send you the offer on Wednesday, you will see _______&quot; on a couple occasions. Then he walked out with me and explained that the team in Vancouver was very diverse and full of cool people, how it was much like a startup, and that I would love it. (I guess he was &quot;selling&quot; me the opportunity) He then said &quot;once you accept the offer, we will fly you back down around 3 weeks later to do the training here, because the Vancouver offices are still quite small and we don&#x27;t have that many hires that week&quot;.<p>Fast forward a month, and after 3 emails from me checking back with them, I received nothing. No offer, no email, nothing.<p>It&#x27;s been a while since that whole experience, and after reaching out to a few employees at Amazon to help me gather some information about what happened, a recruiter told me &quot;All of Amazons development roles require a bachelors degree&quot;.

suggests that many MapReduce-like jobs process relatively
small input data sets (less than 14 GB). Memory has reached
a GB/$ ratio such that it is now technically and nancially
feasible to have servers with 100s GB of DRAM. We therefore ask, should we be scaling by using single machines with
very large memories rather than clusters? We conjecture that,
in terms of hardware and programmer time, this may be a
better option for the majority of data processing jobs.&quot;<p>Their data is based on Hadoop jobs running at Yahoo, Facebook, and Microsoft -- companies most would agree do have real Big Data -- and they find the median job size is <14GB.",1379441666

> Parenthood is one of the most (if not THE most) meaningful parts of being human<p>But we cannot ignore the fact that raising a child is extremely expensive, and children raised in poverty often have very negative outcomes. He&#x27;s not saying poor people aren&#x27;t allowed to have children, he&#x27;s saying it&#x27;s a good idea to try not to, because of the likely poor outcome of a child born in poverty.<p>Poor outcomes such as the child being unable to graduate from high school, or go to college. Repeating the cycle by having a baby in high school, dropping out and probably to raise a high school dropout as well. No one is saying this is always what happens, or that poor people aren&#x27;t allowed to have children. We&#x27;re just saying it is not a good idea to have a child unless you&#x27;re financially stable enough to raise a child with a better outcome. There are obviously plenty of exceptions to the idea that a child born in poverty will have a bad outcome, but the majority outcome is negative (in terms of economic achievement, social mobility, etc).",1379441006

You misinterpreted it to mean the converse.<p>It also agrees with you that there are cases where &quot;Hadoop might be a good option&quot;. It says &quot;The only benefit to using Hadoop is scaling&quot;, and that it might be appropriate for >5TB data sets. Your 1PB example is of course larger than 5TB.<p>So I don&#x27;t think you actually disagree with it.<p>> &quot;Why would you even bother working with toys that put everything into memory and then fail miserably in production&quot;<p>Thank you for calling my software a &quot;toy&quot; and disdaining my field of research. Do not presume that the needs of your field hold for all others.<p>Hadoop isn&#x27;t useful for what I&#x27;m interested in, which is to support interactive search of ~2 million chemical structures. This requires a sub-100 ms query time. Hadoop, last I checked, was lousy for soft real-time work like this.<p>You actually say &quot;Hadoop or any appropriate system that supports your algorithmic model&quot;.<p>My actual solution was the old-fashioned way: a combination of improved algorithms, multithreading, better data locality, and a bit of chip-specific assembly. The result is about 100x faster than the previous widely used tool, and gives me the sub-second search times I want.<p>Moreover, it scales well. I use the new code as part of the inner loop in a clustering task, what once took a week on a machine cluster is now being done on a single node in an afternoon.<p>Had I taken your suggestion I would have invested in more hardware, which would have been the wrong solution for my needs. Also, data size in my field doubles every 5-10 years, which is much slower than the rate of computer performance.",1379440997

Const pointers shouldn&#x27;t be able to modify the pointed objects (that&#x27;s the default in the D language). The fact that working with non-const-correct libraries is a nightmare (prepare to const_cast a lot!). There are plenty of other things that make this a real PITA to work with on sizable projects with legacy or outside code.<p>> RAII is about more than just memory, it&#x27;s about any kind of resource.<p>That&#x27;s true, yeah, though most of the time it&#x27;s about memory (with smart pointers). But you&#x27;re absolutely right on that point.<p>As far as I know, Common Lisp users have some kind of RAII with macros, but I&#x27;m not familiar enough to compare it to C++. Of course, D also has support for this idiom.",1379440932

Im curious about your experience  (phd program, country etc) as I have a different perspective and I frequently wonder if its just my experience in the biology side of academics.<p>In theory I agree, but I very rarely run into people who actually do so on their own 
This board is full of people who actually learn on their own:) People learned to code, people learned how to run businesses and people have learned how to build purely based on their passion to learn/build and contribute to the world.  The reason why this is less so in science is that the resources are behind a paywall. I recently left my academic life to start a business and as such, I dont have access to scientific papers anymore.this limits my ability. This is also the major motivation for my startup which will bring raw academic scientific data to the publicbut I digress. The fact is that you are surrounded by those people, but they arent bringing their ideas to science because the process by which science is done doesnt allow for itand that is a problem.<p>Re: peer-review papers/quality: ahha, Im not sure I agree. Peer review in theory is great, in practice its BS/politics/$$$$. Also, in my experience (YMMV), a lot of references in intros/discussions are oh shit, you have to reference Joe Schmoes 2008 paper here because he is on the editorial board.  Not to discredit your point, I agree that peer review papers, citations and the like are important, but they are being abused now (at least in bio).<p>This is long winded, but my point is that we dont see a lot of people contributing to science because they dont have the resources to do so. I think that needs to change soon and Im working to make that happen.",1379440916

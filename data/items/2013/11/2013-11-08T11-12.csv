The study was about comparing depression rates globally. In that context, taking the average (or mean, but let&#x27;s assume it&#x27;s distributed normally) depression rate as the &#x27;baseline&#x27; (i.e., the middle) is not that strange. This way, the map shows not absolute depression rates, but rather the position of each country relative to the baseline value. Which is, I think, what people are most interested in - if you tell me &#x27;country xyz has a depression rate of 2%&#x27;, most people have no idea. The whole study is not about absolute depression rates, but about rates relative to other countries.<p>I&#x27;d even go as far as defending the purple. Remember, cartography is not about choosing color according to a rigid logical scheme, it&#x27;s about conveying information. Now, I think these colors convey the message of which areas in the world have the highest depression rates, and which ones the lowest, quite well. If white would have been left in as the color for countries with baseline values, those white blobs would have been distracting and would have looked as if no data was available. Instead, what we have is a map that shows in a visually uninterrupted way the rate of depression relative to the baseline, with intensity increasing where you go further away from the baseline.<p>You proposal for using white to red would be OK if it were about showing absolute depression rates, but that&#x27;s a far less interesting way of looking at the data.",1383911697

I&#x27;d be interested in reading the multi-page version, though possibly he&#x27;d be happier spending his time on his more constructive educational output. But maybe two distinct voices calling for royalty-free codecs with different strategies is better than one united front anyway.<p>I noticed that Brendan Eich (edit: sorry it was Robert O&#x27;Callahan <a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/572540/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/572540/</a>) challenged people recently in a comment (sorry can&#x27;t recall exactly where) to name anyone who has done more for the cause of royalty-free codecs on the web than Mozilla.<p>Clearly he didn&#x27;t just forget about Google (in fact I think he brought up Chrome&#x27;s H.264 support in the same comment), so he obviously thinks their contribution doesn&#x27;t measure up to Mozilla&#x27;s. I&#x27;m not sure I agree.<p>Now Mozilla&#x27;s done all sorts of good stuff (hiring many of the Xiph team is just the latest in a long list) but I think the big corporate moves of Google with Android, WebRTC, Hangouts, Youtube, buying VP8 etc. which might add up to literal billions in investment in royalty free codecs are probably going to have more impact overall.<p>Google&#x27;s obviously pissed a lot of folk off along the way, but I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s more a measure of their success than failure.<p>Obviously I&#x27;m not privy to the conversations that Mozilla and Xiph are having with various industry participants but from the outside, probably mostly due to leverage from Android, Google has basically everyone (Qualcomm, Samsung, nVidia, Intel etc.) on board with VP8/9 now with the exception of Nokia, Apple and Microsoft (who, not coincidentally, were the exact same group that killed Theora as a lowest-common-denominator fallback video in the W3C--because our cute cat videos and educational animations are so much better as gifs--as well as being the three companies most threatened by Android). I don&#x27;t see failing to convince them as a PR failure, quite the opposite I&#x27;d consider convincing them some kind of miracle.<p>On the subject of Apple, Microsoft and Nokia, have any of those three publicly committed to using Opus? I mean Microsoft helped build it (via their Skype purchase) but as far as I&#x27;m aware there&#x27;s nothing but ominous silence. Monty seems hopeful but not certain, which doesn&#x27;t fill me with confidence.<p>It&#x27;s particularly relevant as WebRTC just failed to name an MTI video codec mostly because &quot;people might ignore that part of the standard&quot; yet, as far as I&#x27;m aware there&#x27;s no clarity that the aforementioned will even implement WebRTC itself, never mind support Opus.<p>They&#x27;re all still happily ignoring Xiph&#x27;s Flac, many years later, so there&#x27;s plenty of precedent for ignoring widely used and popular free codecs long after any patent bogeyman fades from view.",1383910878
6695565,comment,6694774,6694774,3,0,smackay,,,"There are plenty of ideas for addressing the surveillance problem but perhaps it is time to take a step back and look at the &quot;big picture&quot;. In any conflict, no matter how big or small, there is considerable advantage in having advance knowledge of your opponent&#x27;s intentions. In military conflicts the invention of telegraph, radio, aircraft and satellites has more or less solved the problem with blindly marching into an area and getting annihilated. Nobody ever suggested that these technologies should be banned in order to create a level playing field.<p>It is going to be the same patttern with all forms of electronic communication. The spectre of weapons of mass destruction (anything that can kill more than one person at a time) is the justification/motivation for government and law enforcement to monitor everything online. Whether it has merit is kind of besides the point. It is an advantage, perceived or otherwise, that is not going to be given up, under any circumstances.<p>Another part to this is whether conspiring online actually constitutes a crime. People can chat all day about terrorist plots but until someone actually goes out and starts building a bomb or procuring weapons has a crime really taken place? Only when a society can decide on the answer to this question will it be possible to address online surveillance.",1383910871

6695546,comment,6694170,6694323,6,0,netcan,,,"Interesting comment. Bringing up the capital intensiveness is an interesting point and really gets to the heart of how inherently insane valuing these companies is.<p>The archetype story in my mind of how public companies work is: A company has some proven way of turning capital into revenue. They go to capital markets. Raise money Make the revenue stream and pay it to investors as dividends. This revenue stream has some risks and companies can always fail, but ultimately they risks are small enough that companies can be treated by investors as living forever.<p>Obviously that story gets complicated by reality. But, it&#x27;s a starting point and it has some core of truth when looking at companies like IHG.<p>Companies like Twitter or AirbnB essentially don&#x27;t have capital investments in the same sense.  They have something like R&D costs (though even calling it R&D is weird if you compare it to the R&D of companies like pharmaceuticals) but those are covered by VCs earlier on. They do have revenues and they have even more potential revenues so they have value. But, they are clearly not going public to raise capital with which to grow the business. They are going to get liquidity for their shareholders.<p>The other big difference with IHG is the risk profile. Twitter & AirBnB <i>do</i> have much more rapid growth potential. They also have much more spectacular failure potential. Even a solid company like Google could be obliterated in a few years by an upstart search engine. Facebook, Twitter & AirBnB have even moor &#x27;gone tomorrow&#x27; potential. Twitter or Facebook might just become unpopular, giving way to the next new thing. Most users even expect them to.<p>I think the recent examples from Blackberry & Nokia will be repeated, with even younger companies. I&#x27;m not implying that tech companies can&#x27;t last for generations. I just think they have much higher chances of losing all their value in any given 5 year interval than a bricks and mortar company.<p>All the underlying things are different. The concept of a company as machine turning capital, inputs and labour into revenue doesn&#x27;t apply. The concept of IPOs as a way of raising capital doesn&#x27;t apply. Growth potential is completely different. The idea of companies as semi-immortal doesn&#x27;t apply in the same way. All those things are supposed to add up to a guess at a companies intrinsic value, the rational valuation of the company. Intrinsic/expected value is a pretty abstract concept. It&#x27;s a lot more abstract when we&#x27;re talking about lower chances at a bigger prize.<p>I don&#x27;t know what that means for how companies are valued. I suspect there is more systemic risk as this stuff moves to public markets.",1383909120

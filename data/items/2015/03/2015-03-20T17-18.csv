9239394,comment,9236909,9236909,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"This is a nice example of a statistically significant effect that has negligible predictive value, but that is sold precisely on that value. The title of the paper--&quot;Why Susie Sells Sea Shells at the Sea Shore&quot;--is clearly intended to suggest that implicit egotism results not just in a statistically significant effect, but a usefully predictive one.<p>But the questions of where Susie lives and what she does for a living are not answered in any ordinarily meaningful way by the effect the paper identifies.<p>If I have a coin with a few percent bias toward heads, it would be easy to prove this in a couple of hundred flips, but if I were to say <i>every single time it landed heads</i>, &quot;That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not a fair coin&quot; people would look at me funny.<p>And yet we do this all the time with far weaker causal factors: every significant weather event in the past decade as been reported as &quot;due to global warming&quot;, even though we can be pretty sure that even without global warming there would still be weather, including extreme weather, and even people who take the detailed results of climate models more seriously than I do don&#x27;t claim they predict shifts in extreme weather event distributions that are detectable on a decadal timescale.<p>Moral: we should be cautious about jumping from a statistically significant effect on distributions to a usefully causal account about individuals, even when it is pretty likely that correlation does imply causation, as is the case here.",1426874381

9239389,comment,9237033,9237571,0,0,NTDF9,,,"The reason Indian students collaborate so much is because the way Indian education system works, hustling students survive better. Students who can read, share and gather information with peers always tend to do better than lone geniuses.<p>Also, the population ensures that there aren&#x27;t enough resources for everyone. So, everyone learns to share. A lab project? Share!! You want to do a survey? Form a group and do it. Want computing resources? Share it with others in that time slot. Participating in competitions? All of them are team based competitions.<p>This is a cultural difference. Nothing else. Also, it&#x27;s not like all the Indian kids are homogeneously helping each other. They all have their own cliques and many students don&#x27;t want to share their solutions with other students (Indian or not). Many want to find a better solution.<p>The solution is simple (something the CS reps in my school implemented with great success). Make homework and (some) tests incredibly hard and encourage team work.<p>Some of the programming projects we had were so complex that the class had shared forums where we would solve problems right under the nose of the TAs and the prof with full visibility. So, while the code would be individually written, problem solving in the abstract can be a team effort.<p>An example of how to make them harder would be to deliberately introduce bugs in a codebase that you deployed for a homework. This teaches them how to find solutions and debug.<p>Sure, some students will chill until the last moment and try to gather answers from friends. But, most students who worked their ass off would never share their solutions (mostly to get themselves up the bell curve). A lot of students will try to make their solutions better by improving on the shared common answer but never revealing it to anyone but the grader.<p>For exams, we had open book, open laptop, full internet access tests. In those tests, all students would log into chat box to discuss answers. But the questions were tricky and needed speed to solve. So, being on the chat just made sure students are wasting time. The only people who could finish those tests were students who knew what they were doing.<p>I know this is not ideal in the US. But its a strategy (if used sparingly) that works really well. To be honest, it makes students be super prepared and study real hard so that they can complete tests faster, yet know that they can rely on their friends to get them some info if they happen to forget it.",1426874364

I think his failure lies in equating making money with success.<p>The purpose of commerce is to help us create value for one another. But there is a bunch of activity that uses the same tools that is essentially parasitic. The reason his income streams kept blowing up was that people eventually decided that they were better off without him involved.<p>He could have spent 10 years building products that were creating value. He could have spent 10 years learning the tools and techniques necessary to make the sorts of thing where customers can&#x27;t get enough. Instead, he spent a decade as a leech on the ankle of the economy, getting scratched off and reattaching himself.<p>I could have gone the same way. In high school I had a job doing telephone fundraising. It turned out to be basically a scam, with ~12% of the money collected even going to the non-profit, and therefore even less being spent on actual beneficial work. There was a lot that was appealing in the work: smart, funny people; great challenges; getting paid in cash. But eventually I came to realize how morally bankrupt it was. I got lucky in that it was much easier to see how what I was doing was worthless.<p>So now he&#x27;s basically starting over. And good for him, I say. I think this post is incredibly brave, and I wish him the best of luck in making something so useful that customers are clamoring to hand over their money.",1426874343

&quot;A startup is too much work for one person&quot; and if you can&#x27;t convince even one friend to join you, that doesn&#x27;t speak well for your idea! On the other hand, a bad hire/partnership can ruin the company. YC gives signal it really prefers to look at teams than individual applications.
Q: Do you have have advice or rules of thumb re how much time a solo founder should put into finding partner(s)? Or thoughts re how much to prioritise this, vs. just writing code and talking to users to finish initial version yourself? 
I don&#x27;t mean this to be just focused on &quot;getting into YC&quot; but more in general: what&#x27;s the right way to think about fixing this problem (being a solo founder) vs tackling other things like actually building something initial users can be using?

But the geek-standard for non-musicians is probably Hofstadter&#x27;s Godel-Escher-Bach, which explains some of the clever things Bach did.<p>Bach was exceptionally good at writing parallel lines of music while keeping them separate and individually interesting.<p>The technical name for this is counterpoint. While counterpoint never quite died out - it&#x27;s still used in pop and film scores - no one else has ever written counterpoint quite as dense and inventive.<p>And Bach didn&#x27;t just write it, he improvised it, with six or even eight lines at a time.<p>WTC is an example of writing in different keys - identical note scales that start on different root notes.<p>Before modern tunings keyboards were tuned to a specific key. The other possible keys were always more or less out of tune.<p>With modern tunings the sourness was smoothed out. None of the keys are exactly in tune, but they&#x27;re all similarly good-enough.<p>Bach&#x27;s tuning probably wasn&#x27;t quite the same as a modern tuning. But it was close enough to allow him to write a book of pieces that worked through all the keys on a single instrument without retuning - which was a novelty for the time.<p>WTC is also a kind of pattern book of contrapuntal and compositional techniques. So it made a huge impression - and still does.<p>If you&#x27;re not a musician I wouldn&#x27;t get too distracted by the theory. It helps to know what a fugue is and maybe a little about form, but the music is <i>very</i> good at speaking for itself as a self-contained experience without insisting that you understand how it was put together.",1426872967

You inject data into a process and then check where in memory that data shows up, which execution branches are taken, which registers are used with the data, what the stack does, etc.<p>Fault propagation looks at where errors and faults are handled and how they are handled.

Your environment is a lot more amenable to customization and a lot of Linux users like to spend time getting their experience right for their personal needs. (Not everyone thinks Apple UI is the pinnacle one-size fits all UI solution
)<p>I&#x27;ve put Linux on a lot of random laptops over the years without problem... BUT when I buy a brand new laptop specifically to run Linux on it I do like to do a little research just to make sure I won&#x27;t run into problems.<p>The reason I would not recommend dual booting is mainly that I think in terms of workflow and maintaining context/continuity of software enviroment.. You should choose one OS to be -your- OS and run any other OSes in VMs as needed. If you really want the option to dual boot you can run an OS that&#x27;s installed to disk in virtual box without too much hassle. But in terms of workflow, having to reboot your machine and juggle files and incompatible FSes around will be a nightmare and you&#x27;ll pay a high switching cost if, as you&#x27;re working, you should need a tool from the other OS.<p>Among the people I know and from my own experience over the years dualbooting.. Eventually you&#x27;re going to pick one OS and spend 95% of your time in it and it will be your primary gateway to computing.<p>In my case I run Linux as my main OS and if I absolutely need a windows application(like IE or Photoshop).. I just bring up a Windows VM.<p>You seem interested in Linux and the web does run on Linux but honestly, while installing a bunch of server software directly on your workstation OS is a great way to learn, I can&#x27;t imagine that anyone works that way longterm. So even though you can do it in Linux(and OSX but I would never do this there, it&#x27;s too much hassle and worse for a newbie).. Once you know what you&#x27;re doing you probably won&#x27;t install anything outside of a container or VM that doesn&#x27;t address a personal or overarching need you have--which might very well include development tools you&#x27;re working with or interested in.<p>So.. you&#x27;re probably going to spend some time in Linux.

Without formal relationships between classes, methods, etc., it&#x27;s much more of a manual and error-prone process, as far as introducing inconsistencies in the API.

  -Lower: Can&#x27;t afford leisure time or discretionary spending.  May work multiple jobs.
  -Lower-middle: Earns an hourly wage.  Works at least 40 hours per week, and receives overtime premiums for more.
  -Upper-middle: Earns a weekly salary.  Expected to work 40 hours per week or less, and additional hours are compensated appropriately.
  -Upper: Works only to the extent needed to pay for luxuries.  Never fears the loss of a job.
  -Rich: Never needs to work: is completely secure financially.
</code></pre>
Those are somewhat subjective, but they work for me.  That DINK couple is solidly upper-middle class, but that is the class with the most potential for individually motivated upward mobility.  If they voluntarily limited annual expenses to $50k, got annual raises of 1%, experienced annual expense inflation of 5%, and earned 6% on their investments, they could meet expenses without working after 6 years.  Their investment income would exceed their working income after 17 years.  They could retire in the 18th year, and would never <i>need</i> to work again.  Practically speaking, they would likely continue working, for additional self-worth, savings, and social status, but with the confidence that only &quot;go to Hell money&quot; can imbue.<p>(Of course, income taxes make such a rapid rise impossible.  With an income of $250k, you&#x27;re likely paying at least $100k in taxes alone.  Ignore that for this thought experiment.)<p>They won&#x27;t be rich.  They wouldn&#x27;t buy a nice house without a loan, for instance, but they would surely get the most favorable interest rate available.  They could still be threatened by a market crash.  They wouldn&#x27;t be VCs, but they could be angels or entrepreneurs.",1426871684

By this, I mean a language that has no typing at its lowest level, but you can add it as a library on top of the base level. Then you can add stuff like automatic resolution of calls, etc., as another abstraction level. Of course, you could also add other rules instead of typing. For example, you could pepper your programs with arbitrary proofs, etc., and this could be directed by yet another library on top of your program.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m dreaming. But it sounds like useful to me, as there are so many languages that are almost similar, and yet are slightly different in the way they handle typing and things like polymorphism. It would seem to me that those languages could all share a common base.",1426871477

Screening tests return the odds that what you&#x27;re screening for is found, and at some indicative threshold the more invasive definitive test is performed.<p>Cell-Free Fetal DNA Testing is a screening test. It&#x27;s a <i>fantastic</i> advancement, no doubt, and interestingly the false-negative rate is almost 0. However, amniocentesis is still the gold standard for definitive DNA testing (i.e., if the cell-free screen came back as &#x27;elevated risk&#x27;, the mother would still have an amnio).<p>Further, insurance coverage for the cell-free screen is not at great levels. The screen is not yet standard-of-care. Even with high-quality Silicon Valley big-tech-company insurance, our out of pocket was several hundred dollars. Worth it imo, but again not standard-of-care.<p>Moreover, cell-free screens are not available to women carrying multiples or who used egg donors, both situations that are much more common in the advanced maternal age/IVF segment.<p>It&#x27;s a truly revolutionary technology, but we still have a way to go.",1426871442

In another 15 years it will probably be understood that sexual preferences do not necessarily dictate sexual abuse and that many people labeled as pedophiles have been wrongly labeled in largely the same way as the guy who was found to be in possession of less than a gram of weed while walking past a school and hit with charges as a drug dealer with intent to distribute to minors or the gay man charged with sodomy 50 years ago.

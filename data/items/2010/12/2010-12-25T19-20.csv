There might never be a better time.</i><p>Really agree with this. There's two things you should know which you might not figure out till you're out in the workforce.<p>- This first is that, despite all the news about the economy blowing up and unemployment on the rails, your industry is still aggressively looking for smart people to hire. I get emails almost weekly from companies looking for people to interview. It's a hard feeling to digest sometimes (I'm in my mid twenties), but you won't be left out to dry with your skills even if you go do a startup, burn all your cash, and fail miserably.<p>- Understand working capital for what it is. Your age counts for a lot; lots of young people will never realize that youth is working capital that should be spent while they still have it.<p>I guess the last thing you want to be weary about is burnout, and understand what it is. People love to throw the word around, but they never quite put it into terms, so here it is -<p><i>What I learned is that burning out isn’t just about work load, it’s about work load being greater than the motivation to do work. It was relatively easy to drag myself to classes when I thought I was working for my own betterment. It was hard to sit at a laptop and crank out slides when all I seemed to be accomplishing was the transfer of wealth from my client to my company.</i><p>written by a former consultant of a large firm - <a href=""http://tech.mit.edu/V130/N18/dubai.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tech.mit.edu/V130/N18/dubai.html</a>",1293305682

2039270,comment,2038616,2039103,0,0,NathanKP,,,"I think there are several reasons why Jehovah's Witnesses generally have lower incomes.<p>First of all, we do our evangelical work everywhere, to both rich and poor individuals, but in general people who are poor or immigrants or minorities are more interested in religion when compared to someone who has a high paying job and feels they are already very satisfied with their life.<p>Second of all, Jehovah's Witnesses advocate a simple life. The idea is that it doesn't take a lot of money to live a nice life, its how you use that money. For example, a baptized Witness is not be a smoker, gambler, alcoholic, etc. By quitting the smoking or drug habit many individuals have lowered their expenses, allowing them to live better lives without raising their income.<p>To some extent the pursuit of high education is not encouraged. Although many Witnesses will get an Associates Degree, it is generally not encouraged that they go on to higher education. This does also limit income.<p>But to go along with your comment, yes I feel happy and fulfilled. I spend roughly half my time at the computer doing freelance web development work or working on my startup Bookflavor. The rest of the time I spend with friends or doing door to door preaching. It is actually very interesting.<p>Imagine going door to door one weekend in an affluent neighborhood where a security guard takes down your license plate before allowing you to enter, then the next week going door to door in the ghetto where you have to watch where you step to avoid trash and used condoms. Jehovah's Witnesses get to talk to people of all sorts. As someone who is deeply interested in psychology and sociology I enjoy this communication with people from different cultural and economic backgrounds. Our door to door work is fascinating not only from that perspective, but also from the perspective of practicing real world sales skills. I would dare say any decent Jehovah's Witnesses would make a great salesman/woman.<p>I would say that my life is very interesting, and I wouldn't be any happier if I worked more hours so that I could make more money.

It's clear that we've scratched the surface of a huge opportunity here and what we need more than anything is a brilliant engineer who can execute, lead and inspire. Someone who lives for elegance, speed, and innovation in social products. Someone extraordinarily entrepreneurial to be in the founding team of a company, with equity and responsibilities to match. If you're looking for an hourly rate or a salary before funding, you've missed the point.<p>The prototype was built with Ruby on Rails, and while we're unlikely to switch from that, your brilliance as an engineer and tech entrepreneur trumps everything.<p>Interested? Please contact yo@yoyouwantto.com with some info about yourself - what technologies do you love? built anything cool? what are you doing at 2am on a random wednesday? what do you have going on these days? what about this opportunity interests you?<p>Thanks for reading.",1293304358

Meanwhile, in store A, you never get those bad days, because the parallelism of the front of the queue ensures there's always some progress.<p>Most of the grocery shops I go to either have a single teller (so it doesn't make a difference), a single queue with multiple tellers at the head (most Tesco Express etc.), or a choice of multiple queues or single queue with multiple heads (pretty much all large supermarkets have multi-headed queues for the automated tellers, though it's usually too awkward to buy more than a basket's worth of groceries there). When there's a choice of queue, the multi-headed queue is usually longer than the single-headed queue, though not quite in proportion to its extra expected speed (it's perhaps 75% of what you'd expect), but on the other hand, these queues are sometimes slower because of the inexperience of the people using the automated systems.",1293304220
2039257,comment,2038616,2038940,0,0,angstrom,,,"I think Bertrand Russell's take on this is one of the best:<p><i>Here there comes a practical question which has often troubled me. Whenever I go into a foreign country or a prison or any similar place they always ask me what is my religion.<p>I never know whether I should say ""Agnostic"" or whether I should say ""Atheist"". It is a very difficult question and I daresay that some of you have been troubled by it. As a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one prove that there is not a God.<p>On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think I ought to say that I am an Atheist, because when I say that I cannot prove that there is not a God, I ought to add equally that I cannot prove that there are not the Homeric gods.<p>None of us would seriously consider the possibility that all the gods of homer really exist, and yet if you were to set to work to give a logical demonstration that Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, and the rest of them did not exist you would find it an awful job. You could not get such proof.<p>Therefore, in regard to the Olympic gods, speaking to a purely philosophical audience, I would say that I am an Agnostic. But speaking popularly, I think that all of us would say in regard to those gods that we were Atheists. In regard to the Christian God, I should, I think, take exactly the same line.</i>",1293304061

Let me just say that for a person like me, who hasn't really used Erlang in large projects (mostly on small projects for fun), this post (as a retort to the previous one) was a really insightful introduction to the mentality behind/in Erlang.<p>One comment I've wanted to make about the initial post by Sudarshan Acharya and his point about Erlang's syntax is the following: before delving into functional languages, I had mostly experienced imperative & OO programming. The syntax of any language doesn't really bother me: it's already unintuitive enough that I have to learn <i>a new language</i>, based on typed text, to tell the computer what to do, that worrying about it / contemplating its reason for existence isn't gonna help me in any way.",1293304052

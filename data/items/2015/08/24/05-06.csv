Firstly it assumes that turning something off and restarting will bring it back to some default state.  That isn&#x27;t always true, especially for computers.  Say some new code has been injected.  Restarting, going through the motion of boot and login, may allow that code to do something (harvest logic creds) that it otherwise might not.<p>And the OP assumes that once &#x27;off&#x27; has been achieved that &quot;on&quot; is always a possibility.  Forget the car.  Think airplane that has lost instruments, but the engines are still working.  Turning things off might move you from bad to worse.

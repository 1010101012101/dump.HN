Initially Snowden tried to make contact but Greenwald found the process of digital security too cumbersome and awkward. Poitras however was more persistant. Also, when Greenwald and Poitras went to Hong Kong, they knew little or nothing about physical security. We wanted to change that and make it easier to have everything a journalist like Glenn Greenwald would need to do to meet a source in their pocket - everything from sending a secure email to meeting a source in a high risk location where they may be under surveillance from a regime which may threaten their vital work. So we launched an open source Android app called Umbrella -<p><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.secfirst.umbrella"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.secfirst.u...</a><p><a href=""https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_android"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_android</a><p>It&#x27;s still a long way from being perfect but hopefully will make the life of future Laura Poitras, just a little bit easier.",1454684370

11041763,comment,11033169,11041322,0,0,ignoramous,,,"Much of the customization stem from fixing android&#x27;s perceived shortcomings by the product-management at respective OEMs. Besides, you must realise that Google doesn&#x27;t engage OEMs as much as it should when it decides what goes and what doesn&#x27;t AFAIK, Google does it own prod-mgmt. Android isn&#x27;t a standard. Which is a good thing, &#x27;cause it can move fast and break things (which it often does).<p>For instance, Amazon saw that the WebView was tightly tied with Android and that was security concern (up until it was freed in Android L), and so Amazon made it OTA&#x27;able in its third iteration of Fire OS (Android K).<p>Also, in a crowded market, you need a differentiator. If every phone is going to look and do the same thing, why would anyone buy one device over another? Samsung needs to market things with its offering, it can&#x27;t just do so with Hardware. It needs the stylus to justify the exorbitant price tag on its Galaxy Note line of products. It needs floating activities on its mega-screen and wants people to get hooked on to that feature, to an extent that they can no longer do without it, which makes sure they&#x27;d buy and recommend Samsung over other OEMs.<p>Secondly, hardware is just one part of the equation. Sometimes you require vast changes in Software to make sure the hardware is properly utilized... Or you just have a better Software solution up your sleeve than what Google gave you.<p>Thirdly, some of the Google Apps aren&#x27;t stellar-- Photos is miserable, Camera is a-okay, Music Player is a-okay, Video Player is miserable, Launcher isn&#x27;t smart, Lockscreen isn&#x27;t smart. You need premium apps for your devices. Besides, why would you want Google to walk away with the cake (usage information generated using all those apps) from a customer you acquired with all those hours you spent marketing the phone, establishing your brand, figuring out the quirks of doing businesses globally, toiling endlessly to sort out the logistics, whilst also fighting patent battles, as if the existing technology arms-race weren&#x27;t enough... among a host of other commitments?<p>You and I (and I take that most of the HN community) are purists... not everyone else is.",1454684308

There haven&#x27;t been any to write home about for at least 2-3 years. It&#x27;s now all about multicore (which is also not exactly the best thing for a JS based editor to benefit from).<p>Another issue is that JS performance has already reached most of the optimizations out there. With the JIT-based JS engines there has been a 100x or more speedup from early JS to circa 2010 or so. Not it&#x27;s at best some 20%-30% speedup year over year, and that only in some narrow cases. Even webassemply (when that lands as a viable option) is not expected to change that much.<p>As for the larger developer community, ST already has a huge development community for plugins -- which is where most of the action happens. And sometimes a talented programmer with a strong opinion can be better than &quot;design by comitee&quot;.<p>That said, I find Atom to be a nicely designed editor which would have a great potential, if only it wasn&#x27;t burdened with a crappy architecture and runtime choices.

Tidal is a DSL embedded in Haskell, and can be used to very quickly create patterns of sound: everything from house music to chaotic breakcore to abstract textures. It&#x27;s great for rhythm-based performance (and composition). It isn&#x27;t as good at melody, but it does have some support for MIDI output and melodic expression, and with some effort your library of samples can support melody easily. I found Tidal&#x27;s learning curve to be very shallow, but I think it depends on how you perceive music and rhythm. The Tidal community is working on a better install experience right now (in the meantime you&#x27;ll need to compile a few things from source, etc). It primarily supports Emacs and Atom (Emacs appears to be the most stable).<p>Edit: Tidal is great for both live-coding and static-composition scenarios. In my opinion, it&#x27;s ideal for live coding performance because minimal code is needed to get sound going quickly.",1454683571

Some dependencies are so common, they might as well be a feature of the language itself (Google&#x27;s OAuth Java client libraries or Apache HTTPClient, for example). It would be a waste of time to write a custom OAuth or HTTP library - much better to just add the dependency and go on your way.<p>IMO the danger is greater with other languages that don&#x27;t have the library support that Java does. That Ruby Gem you use today may get abandoned in 6 months and become a piece of technical debt you have to deal with later down the line. It&#x27;s always a balancing act.<p>There&#x27;s also nothing inherently wrong with duplicated code. It can make a code base harder to maintain, but so can over-abstraction.

This is only true for certain areas of law, and it is only true because the states bound themselves by voluntarily ratifying the constitution  (well, enough of them ratified it and a few went along for the ride). Most folks here are unaware that each state is, politically speaking, still as sovereign as Germany or China. Arkansas = Australia. New York = Bolivia. Texas = France (except, Texas is bigger than France).

Producers have no interest in harming their consumers and consumers have no interest in dealing with producers who will harm them. Everyone has an incentive to find ways to ensure mutually beneficial trade. However, when regulatory regimes are monopolized, a new set of incentives emerge which often have nothing to do with consumer safety.

However she&#x27;s not elaborating enough on what it is a &quot;wrong abstraction.&quot; We can be more precise.<p>The real offense when we factor duplicated code is the new dependency that is added to the system. And this is what amateurs don&#x27;t understand. Every dependency you bring into your code architecture costs you and should be judiciously introduced. De-duplication of code ALONE is <i>rarely</i> a strong enough reason to add a dependency.<p>If you want to be a professional programmer one of the most important things to acquire is a distaste for dependencies. Every dependency you add should be carefully considered (and lamented as a reluctant necessity if you decide to introduce it). As a 20 year veteran in this industry having worked on myriad code bases, I will always prefer a code base with duplicated code and fewer dependencies than the other way around.<p>So back to the &quot;wrong abstraction&quot;. When we compose systems, we are looking for fewest dependencies and <i>stable</i> dependencies. What I think the writer means by &quot;the wrong abstraction&quot; is a &quot;volatile dependency&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m trying to be precise here because a common reaction to terms like &quot;the wrong abstraction&quot; is that wrong/right, its all subjective. The truth of the matter is that it&#x27;s not subjective at all -- the higher-quality system is the one with optimally few dependencies and stable dependencies, these are measurable qualities.",1454680830

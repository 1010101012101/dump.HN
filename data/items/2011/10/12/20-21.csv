Not only most states, but numerous municipalities impose sales tax as well. As the article mentions, the problem is that Use tax[1] obligations are generally not paid by destination-state customers. This actually makes a great argument for why the federal government should collect a national sales tax, that is then distributed back to the states.<p>Regarding the legality of states attempts to collect sales tax on inter-state transactions, we can look to the commerce clause[2]. In the courts, one test that has been used is to ask whether a tax creates an unfair advantage for in-state commerce over inter-state commerce[3]. If you take into account the compliance demands created by an inter-state sales tax, I think the answer is almost always <i>YES</i>.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_and_use_tax"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_and_use_tax</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/interstatetax.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/interst...</a>",1318452758

I wonder why would people still do that since they havent been able to get a project up and running that would has a social hook. Email copied below<p>Dear Ahsan -<p>We love you. Yes. Really, we do.<p>We’re building Diaspora<i>, in a spirit of community, because we believe in you. You’re one of the innovators, the creative ones, the people who make the world awesome.<p>We’re building tools that we hope will help you bring your true voice to the world. For no other reason than we want to see what you’ll say and do here. For the pure joy of it.<p>And it’s incredibly moving for us whenever someone steps up to help make it happen, by writing a blog post or contributing code, or giving money. It says someone shares our love for what’s possible, and is going the extra distance to show it. It’s like getting a huge, warm hug.<p>We’re not in this for the money. But today we’re asking for your help -- some money -- to keep building Diaspora</i>.<p>Can you contribute $25.-, or any other amount you feel comfortable with?<p>It will really make a difference, enabling us to build more great features to help you express yourself, however you like.<p>We recently asked Diasporans what they love about our service. There were tons of beautiful responses. Here are a few of our favorites:<p>What people love about Diaspora*<p>Diaspora is:\nFor benefit rather than profit.\nA community rather than a corporation.\nA place where who you are and what you say and to whom is all in your control, not in the control of the people who run it.\nRun by people who listen to their users and respond.\n- Goober Fox<p>It's interesting how much people seem to be sharing on an intellectual level, there are conversations here. Not just short comments and banter.\n- Satu Jokinen<p>...all the... wonderful friends I've made here who are too numerous to list... \n- Garidin Winslow<p>I like that i can control who to share what with. I like that I'm not bombarded with alcohol, sex, dating and violence ads all the time... and I love the whole concept its buil[t] up upon. Its like the internet I got to know when I first got online many... years ago \n- Bohs Hansen<p>Freedom. \n- Paks<p>No clutter. ;) \n- Carlex Crespo<p>This is a simple and effective place for adults, or; just for all the people who appreciate 'simple' and effective things; ha!\t\n- May M<p>Geez, where to begin? :-)\nThe decentralized approach.\nThe absolute freedom of name, gender and expression.\nOwnership of your data...\nKnowing you do it for the sake of advancement and not for profit - makes me want to donate to it!\nThe lovely, intelligent, creative, funny and übergeeky people I am sharing with.\nThe hearts. I ♥ the hearts. And the ☮ signs.\nIt's open source, so no vendor lock-ins or sneaky partnerships\nThe way it could set information free, since a regime can block out one site, but never win a pod info war.<p>And it's just in alpha, right? Whoa.... \n- Lars Christensen, a.k.a. Organic Unit 070678<p>I love the heart of the idea of becoming a Diasporian. Diaspora started off with a good heart. That's what will keep it alive.\t\n- Dao\nIt’s just so heart-warming to read comments like these. What we’re building here is so much more than just another social network. At its core, Diaspora* is a new community, a uniquely free one, based on a positive vision of how we can all experience community online.<p>It’s a community effort too. Which is why so many people are contributing in whatever way they can. And why we hope you’ll take a moment to give $25.-, or whatever you can, to support this vision today.<p>Your support will make a real difference, and it will mean the world to us.<p>Thank you.<p>- Ilya, Dan, Max, Sarah, Yosem, and Peter<p>Wednesday, October 12th, 2011",1318452604

3104541,comment,3103831,3103831,1,0,socratic,,,"This article appears to make the following argument:<p>1.  Ruby/Rails developers use Ruby/Rails even though it is slow because storage access is slower (and thus the bottleneck).<p>2.  Storage access is about to get much faster as people switch from spinning disks to SSDs.<p>3.  Therefore, people will start using faster performing languages because app server language will become the bottleneck.<p>However, there are two questions I have about this argument:<p>1.  How much faster are SSDs in common database scenarios?  Presumably, they are much faster for point queries?  But is it 2x, 10x, or 100x?  How much faster are they per dollar (e.g., how do SSDs compare to tons of spinning disks in RAID)?  Will they impact common caching scenarios (e.g., memcache)?<p>2.  Are app servers ever the bottleneck?  Modern web development seems designed for stateless, horizontal scaling (""scale out"") at the app server layer.  Further, this stateless, horizontal scale out requires no effort for even the smallest shops, through things like Heroku, App Engine, EC2, and similar services.  Will it ever make sense to trade off expensive programmer time (by coding in a lower level language) for less app servers at all but the most extremely popular websites?  Is there some compelling reason the app server layer should not be stateless?",1318452594

This put Canada at odds with the other G8 countries where the patent had been granted. In Monsanto vs. Schmeiser, it was determined that protection of a patented gene or cell extends to its presence in a whole plant, even while the plant itself, as a higher lifeform, cannot be patented. This majority view, based on the precedent of mechanical devices, was central to the Supreme Court's decision, and put the onus on the Canadian Parliament to make distinctions between machines and lifeforms as it saw fit.""<p>Sure sounds like a win in comparison to the alternative.<p>""Schmeiser won a partial victory, where the court held that he did not have to pay Monsanto his profits from his 1998 crop, since the presence of the gene in his crops had not afforded him any advantage and he had made no profits on the crop that were attributable to the invention. The amount of profits at stake was relatively small, C$19,832, however by not having to pay damages, Schmeiser was also saved from having to pay Monsanto's legal bills, which amounted to several hundred thousand dollars and exceeded his own.""",1318451757

So yeah, it was really stressful, and my supervisor was, uh, kinda crazy, which was exacerbated by the stress of running a company on 1/10th the usual staff.   I was just a kid and I couldn't take it.  I quit.<p>I was so messed up that I thought I didn't want to work in IT any more.   I tried to get jobs in other fields; retail, even.  It's harder than it sounds.   Eventually my money and my credit ran out.<p>I got pretty lucky;  I come from an I.T. family and my dad (a mid level IT manager at the university)  was able to get me an interview with a guy who used to be one of his student interns who now had a fairly successful company, so I ended up working through the dot-com dump in my chosen field.<p>So yeah.  some advice:<p>1. use all your contacts to their fullest extent.<p>Seriously, I know it feels weird to do it, but ask your family and all your friends if they know people who have the ability to hire someone with your skillset.   probably 80% of the full time jobs I've gotten (oddly, only maybe 10% of the contract gigs I've gotten) came through knowing someone.<p>2. if you want, sure, apply to lower-skilled jobs.  But don't stop applying to jobs in your field.<p>Unemployment in the unskilled sectors, at least in America, is ridiculously high.  This is much less true of the more skilled sectors.  Also, working a unskilled job, while it can get you out of the parent's house, still counts as unemployment as far as getting your next skilled job, which brings me to 3, which may be my most important point:<p>3. build a resume excuse for the unemployment.<p>It's extremely difficult to get a skilled job after a long period of unexplained unemployment.   Most of the time, resumes from people who are not currently working are simply round filed.    Picking good people is /hard/ and picking bad people is /expensive/ so hr people tend to behave a bit like sheep and mutual fund managers;  if nobody else wants you, the reasoning goes, there is probably something wrong with you.<p>This is where your side business comes in.<p>You now work full-time for your side business.   Consulting, web design, what have you.    Doesn't matter if you actually pay the bills working at the piggly wiggly, as far as your resume and your on-line identity is concerned, you are running your own company.<p>This works best if you actually do work on your personal company.  I would advise giving your services away for free, but from experience, it's actually often easier to sell your services than to give them away (don't be ashamed to accept below market pay if you can't get market pay.  Of course, try to get market pay, but there is a 'shadow IT' industry that pays little more than retail... don't be ashamed to work there if you need to;  it might not pay much but it does count as IT on the resume.)",1318451749

While unemployment remains high, a degree from Khan academy (so to speak) is not likely to get anyone out of the resume pile and into a job. There's a shortage of STEM talent in the US so the tech world is a bit more open-minded about what constitutes a viable education, but in many fields you simply can't work without a qualification from an accredited institution.<p>Take law, for example. In CA, NY, and a few other states, would-be lawyers can study via apprenticeship, distance learning, or some combination of the two; although this can be a career handicap compared to attending a decent brick-and-mortar school, it doesn't impede one's ability to sit the bar exam and receive a law license. But in Texas (a large and growing legal market), it does - you can be admitted as an attorney to some other state bar and to federal bar, but if you got your law degree by correspondence then you won't be given a TX law license. Of course this won't last; eventually some attorney with a non-traditional legal education will win some landmark case in a federal appeals court, and barriers like this will be scrapped because nothing succeeds like success, and no state bar wants prevent a big client from hiring the star lawyer of the moment due to some ancient admittance rule. But right now there's much more supply than demand, so employers have little or no incentive to take a risk.<p>Of course, many jobs do not require same sort of rigorous standards that exist in the professions; you could make an economic argument that all credentialism is a kind of rent-seeking. But it's not going away until there's some alternative measure of skill that adequately predicts performance. Again, it's a bit easier in tech; you can sample the results of someone's work on their web page, and often it either works or it doesn't. It's less obvious how to do that in other fields.",1318451508

Most but not all suicides are preceded by warning signs, and talking about it openly automatically places the speaker in the high risk category.<p>The intent to kill one's self begins with ideation and grows from there. At first, idle thoughts about killing yourself begin to drift through your mind at random. Driving down the freeway, out of fucking nowhere, you imagine yourself veering into oncoming traffic.

The problem is that this warning often doesn't seem serious because the victim is so torn between two conflicting desires: 1) the desire to end suffering, and 2) the desire to live.<p>You see, the crux is this: just because someone doesn't want to die doesn't mean that they won't kill themselves. If they're talking about it, then you should treat it as though they're asking for help.

You can use JRuby and rails, and code the hotspots in java. Hell, you can even code some of the urls in pure java and leave the less significant bits in rails.

As mentioned in other comments 100+ student lectures are pretty much as impersonal, the only difference is you can rewind an online lecture, and usually have it taught by one of the best in the field.<p>Additionally I've supplemented poor university teachers with excellent online classes to much success. Personally I think the future of education should be something like students taking Stanford's ai class with local teachers acting as TAs and adding a few supplements + classroom interaction. You read Norvig's textbook, why not have him teach the material if you can?<p>Having taken far more than my fair share of classes, my experience is that, aside from project heavy courses, only upper level grad classes are really something you couldn't replace with a mass-audience, online course. And these are just training wheels for researching closely with a professor or research team anyway.<p>For lower to mid level undergraduate courses I actually feel that online classes (given that they are top tier classes) are better.

A technique that has at least the constraints of another technique will also have trivially have at least the non-essential coupling of the other technique.<p>I'm not sure exactly what you mean. Could you elaborate please?<p>I'll clarify my view with an analogous example: you can think of a\ndatabase as having a set of types - its schema. Think of each of the\napplications that use that database as also having its own set of\ntypes - its classes or data structures in general. Now, an example of\nthe ""mechanism"" I mean is that SQL provides a way for each app to\ntranslate data in the database's schema into its own data structures.\nIf its data structures change, the SQL can change to adapt to that;\nsimilarly, if the DB's schema changes, it can also adapt by changing\nSQL (or even creating a virtual schema with another layer of SQL - a\nview). Of course, this only works if these are only changes of the\nrepresentation of the information, and the information content itself\nis the same. If the information changes, in a way that the DB or an\napp depends on, then there's no avoiding that dependency.<p>A similar example are JSON/XML API's, where the JSON/XML is like the\nDB, and the data binding code is like SQL. The ""type"" of XML is often\nexplicitly defined with an ""XML Schema"" document; JSON doesn't usually\nhave that, but it is of an implicit expected form - which is still a\ntype, just informally defined. There are also tools for converting\nbetween XML types - XSLT, and may GUI ""XML mappers"" that display two\nxml schema and let you draw lines between them.<p>tl;dr These enable ""modules"" with different types to interoperate\nwithout dependency. Each defines its own types at its own boundary,\nand so can be compiled independently. The middleware glue\n(SQL/databinder/XSLT/datamapper) facilitates interoperation by\nconverting between types at the respective boundaries of two modules -\nprovided those types are equivalent, i.e. contain the same\ninformation, just in a different schema/type.<p>Does your concept of ""non-essential coupling"" include the requirement\nof precisely identical types at the boundary? If so, by loosening that\nto only require the same information, this mechanism avoids that particular kind\nof non-essential coupling.",1318450173

But I don't think he's right in his assessment about Java (the language) coming back. Java's not the only game in town on the JVM anymore. Clojure and Scala are options.<p>Developers would do away with databases if they could, and just use data structures since objects don't map well to relational (ORM problem). So I think as disk access gets faster, either languages will move away from objects, or storage will move away from relational. And the techniques of ORM will only be reserved for really big data.",1318449713

With the exception of search and maps (and perhaps not even search so much now) they actually aren't strong with their products, and (aside from the gargantuan scaling issues that they have to solve) they don't give the impression of working to improve their products.

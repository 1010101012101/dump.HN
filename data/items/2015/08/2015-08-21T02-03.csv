The threat model was widely deployed malware and some targeted attacks. The ISA knocked out the malware plus targeted attacks according to monitoring. The more clever attacks we saw (firmware I guess) were blocked by guards and strong, app-level security. One thing I always got guards to do was modify the traffic patterns to make the system pretend to be a different type of system (eg Linux on x86). Even sophisticated attackers, unable to bypass or even see the guard, apparently couldn&#x27;t get by because they were never smart enough to try an obscure OS + ISA combination.<p>That was a nice hold-up until I learned about separation kernels and split-trust architectures. That was a nice hold-up until recent work on modifying CPU&#x27;s to increase security. Got plenty of those at concept stage that should do plenty with a few having been implemented by others w/ ranging Linux or FreeBSD support. Now, I&#x27;m working on verified specification and synthesis of hardware plus mask and mixed-signal verification to solve the last part of the problem.<p>On a side note, I told some people with simple IT needs to switch to PPC Mac&#x27;s after Apple switched to x86. They just hated all the hacking and malware issues. Set them up with portable software on PPC so they could leave at any time and take their data with them. Predicted software would get supported for years, some of Internet would be usable, and replacement hardware would be cheap due to PPC Macs going on eBay. They&#x27;re still using them today and I got another laptop as an air-gapped machine-in-progress last year for $80. Gonna port Tinfoil Chat transmit node to it if I get time. :)",1440125957

10095755,comment,10091454,10091454,0,0,curveship,,,"I just spent an hour looking at the Imba benchmark.  Yep, it&#x27;s cheating.  Which is a shame, because I really like the framework as a whole.<p>The vast majority of the speedup comes from a single sneaky line of code.  The majority of their &quot;Everything&quot; benchmark&#x27;s time is spent in the reorder step.  They&#x27;ve implemented this as &quot;remove a random todo, render, push the removed todo back onto the end, render.&quot;  The Imba implementation, and it alone, caches the rendered todo view, so that they can re-use it once the todo is reinserted.<p>This single optimization is responsible for the vast bulk of their claimed speed.  Removing it puts Imba only 2x faster than React, not 60x.<p>If you want to try it yourself, look at line 55 of app.js.  Change:<p><pre><code>    res.push((this[&#x27;_&#x27; + todo.id] = this[&#x27;_&#x27; + todo.id] || t$(&#x27;todo&#x27;)).setObject(todo).end());
</code></pre>
... to:<p><pre><code>    res.push(t$(&#x27;todo&#x27;).setObject(todo).end());
</code></pre>
Furthermore, this isn&#x27;t a caching strategy you&#x27;d want to use in a real app.  It holds onto all DOM nodes ever created, thereby leaking quite a lot of memory.<p>Again, I think Imba is cool, and fast, just not otherworldly fast.

Sure, production is generally going to have more servers handling each service (more web nodes, more db/storage nodes, multiple load balancers, etc.), but the setup and deployments should not be any different.<p>All too often, we think of staging as nothing more than a clone of the development environment on a remote server where QA can get at it. If you run your load balancer (haproxy), web server (apache, nginx), database (mysql, postgres, mondo, elasticsearch), caching (memcached, redis) all on a single server for staging, you&#x27;re eventually going to stumble on this kind of hard-to-diagnose problem.<p>One of the main disservices you are doing to yourself with a single-server staging is that all of your traffic is going to be travelling over localhost or, worse, over unix sockets.

Yeah, it&#x27;s best to keep the hardware mostly like whatever developers are used to using and compatible with existing code. Cell was so radically different from typical systems, even SIMD/MIMD CPU&#x27;s, that it was a pain to work with even for cross-platform companies.<p>The Cavium model is more what I was thinking. They make the processors simple, fast, and on a good NOC. Then, add accelerators for whatever. I&#x27;d straight up ask game companies what code, algorithms, patterns, etc keep popping up in their games and could be accelerated. I&#x27;d accelerate some of that. However, I&#x27;d mostly focus on low-level stuff like disks and networking that most developers would prefer to ignore. Solid, high-performance, real-time implementations of all that with hardware acceleration of critical paths. Octeon already does that. That plus a dedicate I/O processor & asynchronous interrupts. That will let the CPU focus on gaming stuff while getting massive utilization.<p>Beats the hell out of &quot;throw more cores and cache at PC architecture.&quot; Intel and AMD certainly dominate in general performance.

6462511,comment,6461494,6461864,3,0,sethkojo,,,"I use Sublime. I prefer an editor over dedicated software or a blog mainly because of the indenting; it&#x27;s also the most powerful text-manipulation tool I know. I have a certain indented writing style that helps structure my thoughts -- I flesh out thoughts in indented paragraphs (the more detailed a thought, the more nested it is). This helps me read a bit faster as I can easily skim by reading the outer most paragraphs and only diving into the details when necessary.<p>I organize my journals by keeping each month in its own file <month yyyy> (e.g., &quot;jan 2013&quot;, &quot;aug 2011&quot;). And in each file I write the date (mm/dd) as the outer most indentation, then write the entry (indented) underneath it. So a typical file might look like:<p><pre><code>  09/27
    Some notes here.

    An idea here.

    A particularly good idea here.
      So I flesh it out here.
        And add more details as I go.

    Some things I learned..

  09/28
    Today&#x27;s entry...
      
</code></pre>
I use software over paper for two reasons -- it&#x27;s much faster to get my thoughts down and I can easily search through my thoughts later (a simple matter of Ctrl+Shift+F). Getting your thoughts down quicker helps with brain dumps which tend to be more useful than refined sentences later on as they capture more of the state that you happened to be in.",1380390746

This is more about Valve&#x27;s business positioning than it is redefining gaming.<p>Everyone&#x27;s already pretty happy with their xbox 360 controllers, but Valve isn&#x27;t happy that their platform isn&#x27;t in your living room. Therefore, they want to bridge the gap so those titles that wouldn&#x27;t translate well to the living room are more playable. Spelunky and SMB are amazing games, but very arcadey. They&#x27;re test cases that can only show that this controller adequately compares to current controllers.<p>A better test would be hearing how people do with titles you could less readily imagine playing on a ten foot display. I want to know, as a PC gamer and input control snob:<p>1) does this let me handle FPS games properly (ie twitch controls to compare to mouse level quality).<p>2) can I play RTS style games and do stuff like macroing and movement with the fluidity of kb/mouse.<p>3) what advantages do I get over an xbox 360 controller, which is decent enough in most cases.<p>4) does the loss of thumbsticks mean a loss of tactile response? I love the sensation of movement within Dark Souls as I tap on my thumbsticks.<p>Nubbins would be helpful it&#x27;s true, but it would be nice to have detachable sticks for those of us who want them. The valve patents from a few years ago showed something like that. Of course, adding thumbsticks then basically rolls back the design to being just another joypad.<p>I&#x27;m skeptical, possibly because in a sense the SteamPad isn&#x27;t doing anything new (while yeah the haptic is probably amazing compared to anything else current), it&#x27;s just trying to translate our current experience of input from the quality we get on desktops, to the couch in our living rooms.",1380390434

(Feel free to correct me on any of this.)<p>The Ripple network works a lot like the Bitcoin network: units of value can be stored at a wallet address, and whoever owns the wallet&#x27;s private key can send funds to other wallets. The big difference is that while Ripple does have its own, internal currency (XRP, which right now is used mainly to pay transaction fees to the network), you can also send IOUs  units of value issued by some third party.<p>So, some party might take USD (could be your bank, or a third party like PayPal or Stripe), Bitcoin (could be your favorite Bitcoin exchange), Euros, etc., hold them, and issue IOU to your Ripple wallet. So you give $100 USD to PayPal, they send an IOU worth $100 PayPal USD to your Ripple wallet (signed by them and stored in the Ripple blockchain).<p>You can send all/part of that PayPal-issued $100 to anyone else via Ripple, just like you&#x27;d send XRP. Whoever wants to can redeem them for USD at PayPal  you just deposit it into a special Ripple address that PayPal gives you and, boom, the money shows up in your PayPal account (because PayPal was holding it all along).<p>Here&#x27;s where it gets even cooler. The Ripple protocol includes an order book where you can trade currencies. So, if I&#x27;m buying something online and use Euros and the company I&#x27;m paying uses USD, my Ripple client could automatically get an IOU for x Deutsche Bank EUR (from my bank), trade it on the Ripple network at the current exchange rate for y Bank of America USD (the seller&#x27;s bank), and then pay them via Ripple in USD that they can deposit straight into their bank account!<p>Eventually most transactions might be done in straight XRP so we save on transaction fees (from trading).<p>That&#x27;s the plan anyway, as I understand it. Ripple ain&#x27;t there yet. But, there <i>are</i> companies out there right now that issue IOUs in a few currencies and are trusted enough that people might accept them for payment.

6462453,comment,6461960,6461960,0,0,wallflower,,,"3 years ago, an ex-RIM engineer posted on a well-known Internet forum called ShackNews about his insider perspective. It was immediately deleted by him - but not before making the rounds of the tech blogs (in excerpts).<p>The money quote is that RIM thought the iPhone was impossible... It was not just beyond business scope - it was beyond their worldview.<p>&quot;You guys could have avoided this entire conversation by just defining what Apple created as something more than a smartphone. What we call a smartphone today is a rather different than what was meant when the term was first coined.<p>The first smartphone was pretty much the Nokia Communicator back in the late 90s. It had data connectivity and some limited ability to run applications, and that pretty much what a smartphone was at the time. Today we take it to mean handheld wireless computer that happens to have a phone, but back then if you send a few packets you were a smartphone.<p>I was hired by RIM in 1999 just before they began work on their first phone and spent a good number years writing RIM proprietary protocol stacks that layered on top of the then new GPRS. Coming from a two-way pager background, RIM decided that phones should have two-way push synchronization of pretty much everything that Exchange provided along with a limited WML browser. The general thought was that phones would never have sufficient power density or radios sufficient bandwidth to allow anything more. That was incredibly predictably wrong, but it&#x27;s how things went down.<p>Along with RIM was Ericsson, Palm, Motorola, and Qualcomm. Motorola came from a similar background as RIM and went on to build very similar devices. Both Nokia and Ericsson had come from phones and had decided feature phones should have far more sophisticated PDA functions. Palm started with PDAs then moved to the phones, but adamantly dismissed ideas like wireless synchronization for years making their first attempts at smart phone far more like early Nokia Communicators than early Blackberrys. Oddly enough, though Nokia made the first smartphone, which was followed by two more with RIM and arguably Palm in 20002, it was Ericsson that popularly coined the term in the mid 2000s.<p>So the point is that all these companies were fighting over what amounts to overgrown PDAs with phones and wireless stacks strapped on. Everyone assumed power density was no where even close to what was needed for general computing, that a full featured browser and heavy duty Internet services were impossible due to bandwidth and latency. Take a look at how our Java expert groups named standards, how people at the time talked about what features smart phones should have, and its clear that no one thought an iPhone was possible. Even Danger, which eventually went on to work on to create Windows Phone 7 and Android, was just working on a better Blackberry.<p>The iPhone did many amazing things, but what stands out in my mind was how it proved that these assumptions were flat-out wrong beyond any reasonable doubt. Apple pretty gave everyone the finger and said, &quot;Fuck you guys we can build your distant impossible future today.&quot;<p>I left RIM back in 2006 just months before the IPhone launched and I remember talking to friends from RIM and Microsoft about what their teams thought about it at the time. Everyone was utterly shocked. RIM was even in denial the day after the iPhone was announced with all hands meets claiming all manner of weird things about iPhone: it couldn&#x27;t do what they were demonstrating without an insanely power hungry processor, it must have terrible battery life, etc. Imagine their surprise when they disassembled an iPhone for the first time and found that the phone was battery with a tiny logic board strapped to it. It was ridiculous, it was brilliant.<p>I really don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re giving Apple enough credit here.<p>They did something amazing that many very prominent people in the industry thought was either impossible or at least a decade away, and they did it in a disgustingly short time frame.&quot;<p>Via <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2044389"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2044389</a>",1380389746

(In fact, I would be very surprised if that were the case, as it goes against what my own reporting has established.)<p>Instead, as the story says in the second paragraph, the NSA is building social graphs based on its &quot;analysis of phone call and e-mail logs.&quot; We know they get phone call metadata via Section 215 of the Patriot Act from telcoms like AT&T, VZ, Sprint, etc., which have long been in bed with FedGov. My guess is that the email metadata comes from two sources: AT&T, VZ, Sprint, etc., and bulk fiber taps (remember, &quot;UPSTREAM&quot; from the earlier Snowden slides) aimed at email providers that do not fully support SMTP-TLS.<p>When I wrote about this in June (<a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57590389-38/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57590389-38/</a>), only Google among the top mail providers was fully supporting SMTP-TLS, while Yahoo Mail, Hotmail.com/Outlook.com, AOL, etc. were not. And for SMTP-TLS, it takes two to tango.<p>A possible third source, also via UPSTREAM, is monitoring HTTPS connections to Facebook itself, which was using 1024-bit RSA keys until recently, as I wrote about here: <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57591560-38/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57591560-38/</a><p>Finally, the NSA is supplementing its email-and-phone metadata database with whatever it can vacuum up through public records (the article refers to voter registration rolls, property records, and Facebook profiles) and non-public data held by regulated industries that, unlike large Silicon Valley companies, have little interest in litigating against FedGov on privacy. The article refers to bank codes, insurance information, passenger manifests, billing records, and &quot;location-based services like GPS and TomTom&quot; -- odd wording, that, and a hint that the reporters may not have understood all of their material. Cell phone location metadata from carriers is probably included as well.<p>In other words, Facebook can be reasonably criticized for moving slowly away from 1024-bit RSA keys and not supporting SMTP-TLS, which have made it easier for not only the NSA but other intelligence agencies to conduct surveillance too. But this story is not about the NSA having direct access to Facebook&#x27;s servers or getting bulk dumps of direct messages from Twitter, and in fact there&#x27;s zero evidence that&#x27;s the case.",1380389425

There are plenty of things in math that benefit from this treatment. It&#x27;s good to just know definitions, then when you come across something that satisfies it you&#x27;ll know what to look for to find out more about it. You&#x27;ll know the exact requirements of theorems so that you don&#x27;t have to once again look on wikipedia to see that yes this does require a compact set. You&#x27;ll find a card that says something you&#x27;ve reviewed before but go &quot;wait, why is that true?&quot; and then work out the general idea again.  You can memorize known identities that are just plain useful, things that can&#x27;t be easily Googled but can be easily recognized. You can put warnings to yourself that certain theorems can be easily applied incorrectly. You can learn the most common names for theorems so that it is easier to communicate with others about them.<p>And above all, it&#x27;s just another chance to look over things you already should know. I won&#x27;t claim that it&#x27;s more or less useful than reading a textbook for the equivalent amount of time or doing problems, but it&#x27;s certainly more useful than doing nothing.<p>P.S.

This way, individuals will be able to save a lot of money on the items of their choice in a combo offer. Also, restaurants will be able to sell more combo offers without lowering prices any further in todays cut throat competition. A win-win situation for both.<p>Combo offers can save individuals lots of money. Please look at the following case:<p>Case: If an offer of Buy 1, get 2nd at 50% off is available for a $10.00 pizza, then: 
Combo price = $10 + $5 (50% off) = $15<p>If two individuals form a group to buy this combo, each individual will have to pay $7.50 for a single pizza i.e. a saving of $2.50 (25%) per person.

An alternative approach would be to take some common source data structure, generate code and then generate types to validate that code. Those are two separate transformations, not one like with type providers. Type providers mean that type checking, compilation, and execution are coupled. In this Gist, you could run the code with or without type checking and you could ignore the code generation completely and run type checking for internal consistency. Much more flexible.",1380388246

My very first job, supporting cancer research, was actually probably pretty important in the scheme of things, and the owners were relentless about busting our chops if we started to take ourselves seriously. I liked that, and found it healthy.<p>So, a less flippant &#x27;my cause&#x27; statement. I&#x27;m an engineer. I like solving hard problems. I work hard regardless of whether your business is &quot;important&quot; or not. Now maybe I&#x27;m falling into the &#x27;hire somebody just like you&#x27; trap, but I&#x27;d far rather hire somebody motivated by solving problems, not somebody motivated by the extrinsics.<p>I am not saying you are wrong, but I am offering a counterpoint. Personally, I scoff at most of the job listings on here. &#x27;Change the world with our personalized back scratching service&#x27; or whatever (only a tiny change from a lot of the actual job postings, I made it silly to avoid ticking off legitimate businesses). Tell me you want me to scale your back room, or your analytics are really hard and no one really knows how to extract meaningful data, or you are trying to get your latency down, or you are moving to GPU and CUDA to solve some computational problem. I&#x27;m there, I don&#x27;t care <i>too</i> much if it is Santa Strike or cancer research (I care some, I am overstating things a bit to make a point).<p>I&#x27;m expecting some push back on this, and that&#x27;s reasonable. I&#x27;ll just point out that while I am not a pure blood capitalist, I do think the markets will tell you if what you do is &#x27;important&#x27; in the form of success. Which is not to say really important things might fail in the market, they do. But if you are making money you are providing value to somebody, and that is, to my mind, enough reason to live and contribute. The world would be bleak indeed if we focused on very. serious. and. important. problems.",1380388065

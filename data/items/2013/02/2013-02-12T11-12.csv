I have 5x16A + 1x20A and a 35A main circuit breaker, so I can pull about 8kW all together. Enough for a few kettles :)
(This is for a a 40m^2/400 sq.ft. condo. A house would have more circuits and a larger main circuit breaker. And this is for Norway - we tend to follow similar standards as Denmark and Sweden, but there may be differences I'm not aware of.)",1360668143

If it's flat or down hit you can ride a bike carrying a huge load. If it's up hill you can drop to a low gear or just push the bike. For a few years now I've taken a bike to Glastonbury Festival - even in mud and hilly terrain I can carry everything for the 5 days on one bike, pushing where I need to freewheeling where I can. And get to site much faster than friends walking, and carrying far more.<p>Similarly for years I would ride a BMX to the supermarket, then load up the handlebars with shopping bags and walk it home - no struggling with heavy bags, and no need for a car or even a bus (which still leaves you struggling from the stop to your house) - I can easily do a full weeks shop for 2 on a bike. Now I have a proper shopper with panniers and baskets - even easier - but handlebars are all you really need!<p>For a guy that travels all sorts of roads on what is pretty much a racer check out: <a href=""http://ultralightcycling.blogspot.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ultralightcycling.blogspot.co.uk/</a>",1360667959

5206138,comment,5204967,5206049,2,0,viraptor,,,">  You would need another function that builds objects out of them.<p>I.e. you don't bundle your serialiser with your json parser. I think that's a good idea. How do you customise? most likely a callback that builds an object or returns the json fragment unmodified if it can't. It can be streamed too in order to accumulate / rebuild fragments of the tree.<p>Whether object is simpler here (builder / factory style), or another generator, that's a matter of taste mostly.<p>> For instance if you want to skip past objects.<p>You can't skip past objects at a tokenizer level, unless you implement logic of skipping whole structure. But that's what the parser does. Why don't you just skip the objects based on the streaming API? You don't have to construct them first - it's up to your deserialiser implementation if you want to ignore parts of the structure.<p>> Try using a streaming JSON API like Twitter's firehose.<p>From the documentation (unless I'm reading the wrong format description):<p>""""""The body of a streaming API response consists of a series of newline-delimited messages, where ""newline"" is considered to be \r\n (in hex, 0x0D 0x0A) and ""message"" is a JSON encoded data structure or a blank line.""""""<p>That's not a huge JSON document. They use the newline delimiter as you described later. I don't think that's because ""most libraries are horrible or useless for parsing streamed JSON"". Why would you ever want to stream JSON which is an infinite and never complete object? What's wrong about splitting by newline? By making newlines the message separators, you'll never have to worry that your stream becomes broken due to some parsing error: bad message? ignore it skip to newline, continue with next one.",1360667308

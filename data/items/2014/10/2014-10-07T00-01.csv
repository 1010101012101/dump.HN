Quora has two more twists: It allows you to post to social networks so your friends know that you are helping people with your knowledge (oh - I&#x27;m sorry - it just does that by default). Quora also has ties to online versions of some known publications where they post popular answers. So suddenly you are &quot;published&quot; bonafide writer in likes of Business Insider, Info World etc. I know of people who perhaps spends ~2 hours a day writing beautiful answers to stupid questions like &quot;why this actor is so popular&quot; complete with screenshots, trailer videos, dialog transcripts and so on.<p>The same gamification strategy works on sites like StackOverflow, Reddit and HN. The most successful ones have some twists like Quora, like StackOverflow throws in bonus of putting your points in your resume. I once saw the top points earners on StackOverflow was Jon Skit who had earned 700k+ points. I looked at count of his answers, length of average answer and estimated that he must have spent 4hr per day each working day for past 4+ year to get that many points. This was on minimum side. If you convert this to hourly rate, it&#x27;s same as he donated about half a million to StackOverflow.<p>Now if you can upvote this answer, that would be great ;).",1412643475

8419214,comment,8416393,8418809,1,0,JonathanDHall,,,"My opinionated answer to the statement released by Yahoo!:<p>I won’t sit here and say that I think they are lying. To make such an accusation would only prove me to be a fool not having ammunition in the weapon before I fire it. I will, however, say that I believe – in my opinion – that this is a wordplay and a game of semantics. First off, there are several “shellshock” exploits. The term “shellshock” as the media has portrayed it is to execute the vulnerability or vulnerabilities recently discovered in bash by means of delivering the following payload: () { :; }; <commands><p>When we look at this payload, what we are actually seeing is a function definition, not the execution of or calling of that function, with the regards to the following: () { :; }; <p>The actual “arbitrary code” to be executed last past that point, where we’re no longer defining a function, but instead – giving instructions to be executed on the operating system via Bash. One could inevitable argue that taking the payload, and modifying it to look like: () { whatever; }; /bin/bash –c ‘id;uname –a’ could, or even could not, be identified as “shellshock” in the manner of which it was portrayed to be by the media. However, the fact still remains that this “payload” would cause the execution of the commands proceeding the {}; <p>When we look at the other SIX (6) payloads that essentially accomplish the same exact thing: <a href=""https://shellshocker.net –"" rel=""nofollow"">https://shellshocker.net –</a> we see that modification of the “payload” does not stop the blatant fact that the same underlying results are achieved via the same exact vulnerable code in the Bash shell. <p>My response to Yahoo! : Please issue out the UNTAMPERED and UNMODIFIED apache logs, showing the payload delivered to your “sports API’s” - and other researchers, and potentially shareholders, determine what the underlying cause was. Furthermore, to state that this resulted in bypassing your “IDS/IDP” and “WAF filters” makes me wonder exactly what kind of IDS/IDP and WAF filtering you’re imploring. I’m willing to bet there were exact phrase match filters looking for what most sites have identified as the “Shellshock” vulnerability, I.e. “() { :; };” and preventing the scripts and/or bash from being executed once that string was identified. That could have been with something as simple as a wrapper for bash… And considering the IPS/IDS didn’t pick up on outbound IRC connections on port(s) 6660 and/or 6667, which NO internal server would have a reason to be connecting to, I can only say that your concept of IDS/IDP is seemingly inadequate in my professional opinion. So, once again, since the vulnerability has seemingly been “patched,” I urge you to release the details of the vulnerability in the script, and also explain why it is that the initial compromise appears to have been on a web-facing box with public access to it, and found amongst a botnet running a perl script that had self-spreading and searching capabilities based around the “shellshock” vulnerability? You are comparing apples and oranges, when in all actuality, you should be comparing “to-may-to” to “to-mah-toh.&quot;",1412643374

He&#x27;s missing something really big that&#x27;s a core of Chinese culture.<p>> the &quot;We here in the Maker movement could not be more pleased with ourselves&quot; vibe.<p>This is another of way of saying that we enjoy making here beyond earning a living. Yes it&#x27;s work, but it&#x27;s also recreation and art. In places like SV and NY, people make because mainly it&#x27;s fun.<p>Over there, &#x27;making&#x27; is not really something you enjoy; it&#x27;s a means to an end. It&#x27;s something you have to do to make money or save money, which in turn provides for your family and increases your reputation the more money you accumulate.

There&#x27;s no doing something just because it&#x27;s cool and not practical. It must be practical. (This imo is another reason why Chinese open source is anemic.)

The idea being that the Buddhist monks visiting China from India were interpreted through a lens of Taoism.

This is the view that Wong Kiew Kit states in The Encyclopedia of Zen(referenced above).<p>People like Kit believe that Siddhartha Gautama discovered enlightenment on their own, and that enlightenment is the exact same kind of enlightenment as what modern Zen masters discover.<p>To quote myself now, &quot;With only very rare exceptions, it requires an authority to transmit.&quot; It is not unheard of for students of Zen Buddhism to achieve enlightenment on their own.<p>Bankei, a famous 17th century Japanese Zen master, is recorded as having achieved enlightenment while watching a bloodied ball of phlegm slide down a paper wall. The story goes that he was so frustrated with the fake Zen masters in Japan at the time, that he sat on a mountain top until he first achieved tuberculosis and almost achieved starvation. Zen was so debased in Japan at the time that this was the only way for him to achieve it. All the other masters were fakes.<p>Among modern Zen masters it is understood that what Gautama Buddha achieved and what Bankei achieved are the exact same thing.

In this event your video will be taken down and you will receive a copyright strike on your account. If you have received additional copyright strikes, this may suspend your YouTube account</i><p>The article incorrect interprets these two options as:<p><i>Agree with us that you are a dirty lying dirty thief, and we&#x27;ll still allow it to play in some countries.<p>Disagree with us, and we&#x27;re going to take it down everywhere forever. And I hope you know that this will go down on your permanent record.</i><p>This is incorrect. Here&#x27;s what the two options actually are.<p><i>A: All claims are removed from your video. Nothing happens to you. Fair use wins. Glory be. The person making the claim didn&#x27;t actually come after you with lawyers.<p>B: The person who is claiming copyright actually gets lawyers and comes after you for real. You&#x27;ll have your chance to fight in the legal system. If you lose, the video is taken down and you&#x27;ll get a strike. If you win, well, you win. Congratulations.</i><p>We have appealed many many videos. We only appeal ones we feel are fair use. Ones that are obviously not fair use, we just say yes to start out with. EVERY SINGLE TIME we have gone all the way on appeals, we have ended up with result A. Not one single claimant on our absolutely fair-use videos has actually tried to take us to court. The claims on our videos were released. The end.<p>It&#x27;s just a bunch of scary text, but it&#x27;s ok for it to be scary. If you push it all the way your video will be up with no claims.

And there are a lot more system administrators out there than desktop environment developers, and (on average) have more system administration experience than the desktop environment developers.<p>This also assumes that sysadmins don&#x27;t use the kernel debug flag, and only kernel developers do.

The things Tesla and SpaceX and SolarCity are doing really are very cool, and they sit at the heart of some of the biggest problems and challenges of the 21st century. An inevitable shift to green energy and the final frontier. For Tesla it&#x27;s just a cool startup with a slick product, some ballsy moves, frequent run-ins with local/state competition and media clickbait journalists, and a product that for me is a bit like the iphone: not the very first smartphone, touchscreen, mobile os, app store, not the thing the average western consumer will have let alone the average person on the planet, not the cheapest or the most inclusive, but a frontrunner with a huge and lasting impact that will drive everyone else, a company that sets a bar. That&#x27;s exciting.<p>And for SpaceX, well, that&#x27;s just really exciting. This notion we&#x27;re regularly shipping all kinds of stuff to a freaking permanent space station and returning safely and making multiple trips with the same vehicle over and over, is insane. A one-time planned crash on the moon and on the earth is one thing, but we seem to start to really grasp <i>real</i> control in space, where we can comfortably do lots of different things at an accelerated pace, cheaper and cheaper, and renew the interest, investments and plans in space that laid dormant for a few decades. SpaceX being a part of that, as a private startup company that again is making ballsy moves, is a hugely compelling story.<p>SolarCity is the least exciting for me personally, but I think it&#x27;s also hugely important. Generally sits in the top 3 solar companies in the US, doing cool work, like building the biggest ever US solar farm. Creating a solar security, solar leasing options and retrofits (a not so sexy but very important part of our energy discussion). I don&#x27;t follow the company too much, oil prices have been low recently and shale gas has exploded on the scene, so I expect it to be the most difficult company to run as it&#x27;s hard to get it cheaper than coal/gas. As solar only has a &#x27;moral&#x27; benefit to consumers, and the average customer isn&#x27;t willing to pay a large premium for something that&#x27;s moral (because green) especially with all the rhetoric on climate denial, the company is in many ways limited to the growth in the industry.

Ollie&#x27;ing is like riding a bike, never forget how to do it. :)<p>It&#x27;s tough for me.  I skated nearly every day of high school and not much since then.  I got on a board a few months back and it was like starting all over again.   The biggest difference that I noticed was my diminishing flexibility.   I need to start managing that--my wife, a physical therapist, says that lack of flexibility in our 30&#x27;s and 40&#x27;s is highly correlated with likelihood of falls when we are elderly.",1412640073

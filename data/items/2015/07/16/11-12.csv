9896622,comment,9896141,9896360,0,0,analog31,,,"In my view, a side effect of our legal system is that it&#x27;s a very generous public gift to lawyers. And there&#x27;s probably a perverse incentive for lawyers to manipulate that system to make it more lucrative and exclusive (e.g., more complex, so that regular people can&#x27;t take care of their own minor legal issues). As such, I see no problem with maintaining a more equitable distribution of legal support.<p>The ideal situation would be to establish a social norm, where successful pro bono defense work was a badge of honor. This work should include not only criminal defense, but also helping the poor deal with civil cases.",1437047983

Less disruption to those actually doing the work.<p>> a) It should be all remote, or all local. You ruin the fun for people if a chunk of the team if talking, and chat is dead.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in both situations. I&#x27;m remote now on a 100% remote team, but I&#x27;ve also worked in the main office and communicated with two remote co-workers. With Google Hangout and Zoom, I&#x27;ve noticed no difference between these two setups. People who work better by talking everything through in person will just use google hangouts to have conversations with the people they need and leave the rest out. You still wind up with some people being left out of the loop and chat is still 90% dead, except for the occasional entertaining gif and water cooler talk.",1437047680

9896589,comment,9889609,9892396,0,0,gjm11,,,"It&#x27;s true that economics is not amenable to experiments as reliably informative as those of, say, physics. And it&#x27;s true that, all else being equal, the less reliable your experiments the less weight their results should get relative to theoretical predictions.<p>But it isn&#x27;t only the experiments that are less reliable in economics than in physics. The theory is less reliable too. (For two reasons. Firstly, <i>because</i> it&#x27;s so hard to do experiments whose results you can trust, the evidential basis for the theory is weaker. Secondly, because people are more complicated than, say, electrons.)<p>How does this cash out in the case of the minimum wage? We have some empirical evidence suggesting that minimum wage increases don&#x27;t increase unemployment much if at all, but we can&#x27;t trust it too much for the usual reasons (not enough data, too many confounding factors, small effect sizes). And we have some simple theoretical arguments suggesting that minimum wage increases should increase unemployment quite a bit (supply and demand from Econ 101), but <i>we can&#x27;t trust those much either</i> because the real people involved in the labour market are not the perfectly rational perfectly selfish perfectly spherical agents with which Econ 101 is concerned. It simply <i>isn&#x27;t true</i> that increasing cost always reduces demand: there are multiple mechanisms by which in particular circumstances it can do the reverse. It simply <i>isn&#x27;t true</i> that the labour market behaves exactly like the market for, say, corn. People are complicated.<p>So I don&#x27;t agree with what I take to be your argument about the minimum wage, namely that because we don&#x27;t have great empirical evidence we must rely on theory and firmly believe that increasing the minimum wage will severely increase unemployment, and that this means that an <i>honest</i> supporter of minimum wage increases is obliged to accept that their preferred policy will increase unemployment substantially.<p>Incidentally, I&#x27;m not even so sure about that pebble thrown into the ocean. The sea-level rise is a tiny effect, after all, so we can&#x27;t just ignore other tiny effects. For instance: a slight variation in the shape of the earth, with less mass on land and more on the ocean bottom; a tiny change in ocean currents, which might change erosion patterns and change the volume of the oceans one way or another; maybe some funny effect via disturbing local ecosystems and ultimately affecting human food supplies a little. These are all <i>really small</i>, but so is the obvious effect of throwing the pebble in.<p>For that matter, if you&#x27;re on a boat when you throw the pebble in, the pebble goes from displacing its own <i>mass</i> of water (thank you, Archimedes) to displacing its own <i>volume</i> of water, which is smaller, so the immediate first-order effect is that the water level goes down.",1437047343

It must cost a lot to hold all that gold. The reason it does is because that gold implicitly (but not explicitly) backs the US dollar. If the dollar began crashing tomorrow, Obama could go on TV and say he was opening the vaults of Fort Knox and would exchange dollars for gold.<p>Seriously? Those 8000 tons of gold, priced at today’s price of 1144.45 as of a few minutes ago, have a value of $296,002,697,361.7893--a little under $300 billion. Sorry, but $300 billion just isn’t a lot of money in the grand scheme of things.<p>To put that in perspective, the market capitalization of just one company (Apple) is just over $723 billion dollars.<p>The gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States is over $17 <i>trillion</i>. If we have some kind of financial crisis, $300 billion in gold (obviously the price would increase in the event of a real crisis) isn’t going to go very far in a $17 trillion dollar economy.<p>The point: the dollar isn’t backed in any way, shape or form by the gold the U.S. holds.<p>We should be more concerned about the dollar than bitcoin—$100 in 1900 was worth only $3.48(!) in 2012: <a href=""http://observationsandnotes.blogspot.com/2011/04/100-year-declining-value-of-us-dollar.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://observationsandnotes.blogspot.com/2011/04/100-year-de...</a><p>History shows us that all fiat currencies (so far) eventually go to zero.<p>Final thought: Bitcoin may or may not survive long term, but not because the concept of a cryptocurrency is unsound or that blockchains don’t work. Bitcoin has proven its value is based on its usefulness and flexibility: the ability to transfer value of any amount to anyone else anywhere else in minutes without needing permission and at little or no cost.<p>Bitcoin is the prototype, not the final product.<p>Besides bringing blockchain technology to the world, bitcoin is an invention that can’t be uninvented now that it’s here.<p>The same way a Mac user from 1984 might not recognize a Retina iMac today, we will have some type of cryptocurrency that will be mainstream and accepted at some point in the not too distant future. It may not be bitcoin (though it’ll still be around) but some successor that addresses some of its weaknesses and builds on its strengths.<p>Final final thought: bitcoin is already a fairly big deal in developing countries where regular people are unbanked. It’s also a big deal in countries with unstable currencies, some of which have already gone to zero once or twice: <a href=""http://bitcoinfilm.org/documentaries/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitcoinfilm.org/documentaries/</a>.",1437045549

We use it on a day to day basis, which I guess makes me a MUMPS developer.<p>As a programming language, it&#x27;s a fairly standard procedural language. Cache introduces the ability for scoped java-like classes over the top of the standard procedural code and there&#x27;s a SQL/ORM layer that at least allows a definition for the giant persistent hash table. That being said, a bunch of our code is in the legacy unscoped routines which is... interesting.<p>The two real downsides are the complete lack of libraries for it (imagine having to allocate time to port DEFLATE as part of your developement scheduling) and the fact that 20 years of schemaless, unvalidated, tightly coupled data access leads to a boatload of weird bugs.<p>Feel free to AMA.",1437045233

This is most clearly visible on shuttle services between a small and a large city - busy going to the large city in the morning and to the small city in the evening, and semi empty in the opposite directions.<p>Also seasonal flights - the first flight of the season to depart the destination (and the last to arrive) will often be pretty lightly loaded.<p>When that situation arises, you will need to reposition a less-than-full aircraft, otherwise your operations obviously falls apart. The GP clearly experienced an extreme case of this, but most likely that aircraft was being filled up at its next departure, and so needed to be there.<p>This is obviously expensive for airlines, so they try all they can to fill up these flights - which explains that the cheapest tickets are often on times that will be slightly odd or inconvenient, at least to business travellers.",1437045175

He could be a billionaire by the end of this decade and, by the end of the next, his contract would be worth more than the insurance company which stands behind it, Aviva France.<p>There is no mystery to the financial magic, however.

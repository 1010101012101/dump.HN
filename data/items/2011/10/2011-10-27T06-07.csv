Epigenetic modification is really interesting and still not very well understood insofar as how the response occurs. These methylation changes may also occur as a response to other environmental stresses later in life as well as childhood, and other epigenetic modifications may be passed to offspring. We should see some very interesting discoveries that change our current ideas of heritability and response to environmental stimuli in the next few years as we're able to better detect the epigenetic factors in a cost effective manner.",1319698632

Apple is known to approach companies that are likely to infringe on what Apple believes to be their IP, a recent example that came to light was a meeting between Steve Jobs and Samsung executives.<p>It's clear Google will not (and never were) going to heed any directions given by Apple. Apple probably did approach google about it, but I suspect it's likely that Google held back on the feature due to potential legal ramifications of including the feature.

voluntary if you don't know about it (i.e. what data Facebook collects

it in accordance with the law. So, when Facebook provides us with
their services, I really don't see why I shouldn't be able to request
the information that Max has requested from them. It is actually my
right to use their service, and then ask them to provide me with the
data they have stored about me. Of course, Facebook will <i>also</i> expect

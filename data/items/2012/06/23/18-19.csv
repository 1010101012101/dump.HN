4151509,comment,4151106,4151370,22,0,dredmorbius,,,"Here's the bit about all of this data tracking that bothers me the most.<p>The data is, in large part, a one-way street.  The companies which are most aggressive in <i>collecting</i> information are also the most aggressive in <i>not disclosing</i> how they use, share, distribute, aggregate, correlate, etc., this information.  Look at the NDAs and ""no talk"" policies of Google, Facebook, any of the credit bureaus, to say nothing of the vastly less visible enterprises which service the B2B markets of data mining and information.  It's an area in which I had some experience and washed my hands in disgust years ago -- it's also an area in which I'd very much like to leverage open channels and tools to provide the public with the ability to fight back against the problem.<p>I've had a very clear view for over a decade now that this will not end well.<p>The truth is that <i>the public</i> has little understanding of <i>what</i> data are being used, <i>how</i>, or <i>by whom</i>.  Much more pernicious is how data can be aggregated.  Your insurance company gets information about your car and license.  Your smog check station runs a standard battery of tests against your vehicle and reports this to the state in a large electronic record.  Your state turns around and sells this database, at a very, very low charge, to companies providing services to the insurance industry, so that based on VIN and license information, a huge dump of data form your car's onboard data collection systems is now available to your insurer.  They're mostly interested in total mileage, but as car data collection systems advance, there could be a great deal more information there -- accelleration/decelleration, speed, conceivably in the future, GPS waymarks.<p>And you'd never know about it.<p>The mileage stuff?  That's for realz and has been for a decade or more.<p>Edit:  and just to put a face on this: <a href=""http://www.iso.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iso.com/</a><p>The truth?  That few even within the datamining field know what others within the field are doing with data (see above WRT one-way information), unless that information is being directly marketed/sold.  Where derived products (e.g.: risk/profitability profiles based on models in which individual inputs are not disclosed) are sold, even uses which are directly sold may be using information in way undisclosed to the data suppliers / users, let alone the members of the public who are being profiled.<p>What could possibly go wrong?",1340477955

4151481,comment,4150927,4150927,10,0,DanBC,,,"Cultural note:<p>In the UK there is someone called a ""nearest relative"". This person is defined in law[1] and has some powers.  If the nearest relative says that a person should be detained in hospital the clinicians must ""consider"" that option.  They don't actually have to do it, but they have to record that they've heard the request, and that they've considered the request, and that they've declined that option.<p>When you are worried about the mental health of someone you should call their GP.  This can be an emergency appointment.  S/he will come and assess the person, and maybe ask for a local ""crisis and home resolution treatment team"" (might not be called that in your area) to come and assess the person.  Hospitalisation is sub-optimal, patients have strict[2] rights, and so it can be hard to have a person detained against their will in hospital.  It is not lawful to say things like ""Go voluntarily or we'll section you"", but sometimes the person can be persuaded to go voluntarily.<p>If the person is out of the home you should either get them home and call a GP; or call the police.  The police have something called a ""section 36"" where they can detain someone for a short time for assessment.  This should be a ""place of safety"" - unfortunately this place of safety can be the police cells, rather than a special building.<p>Once someone has had a psychiatric incident it's a really good idea to make a ""Rainy Day Action Plan"".  You keep notes of useful phone numbers and contacts[3] and instructions from the person about signs to look out for, and what to try and do, and what to do when things get really bad.  You make the person write on this, and sign it. It is <i>their</i> document, and it's important that it's their words and wishes.  This certainly helps if you need to get them hospitalised or medicated in future.<p>UK law is a bit complicated.  Every patient should have advocacy available, and I certainly recommend that people try to get hold of advocates.<p>I am not a doctor or clinician or etc.  This is just anecdotal advice from a random internet stranger.<p>[1] (<a href=""http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Legislation/Actsandbills/DH_4002034"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Legislatio...</a>)<p>[2] Sometimes those strict rights are ignored.  It's very annoying.<p>[3] There's a lot of churn in staff in MH services.  Don't expect those contacts to stay valid for very long.",1340477379

People like that\nactually do exist, and knowing how to deal with them is beneficial.<p>The less obvious but much larger problem is simply miscommunication.

It's a form of punishment just because statistically there were specific criminals in the past that escalated them into harmful acts. And as our society progresses, we'll have to decide if it's ok to do that for the greater good: if it's ok to snoop credit card bills for fast food purchases in order to charge a higher medical insurance fee each month.

So, he refuses to buy an Apple phone -- even going to ridiculous extents to exercise a non-Apple option -- ironically, allowing himself to be defined by Apple products!<p>If Apple goes left he will go right, if they go up he goes down; he is still deciding his tech choices based on Apple's choices, only he's navigating the whitespace where Apple fans navigate the blackspace. If he were truly free, he would simply choose the best phone for his needs and lifestyle. Instead he is as slavishly bound to Apple as the people he mocks.",1340474651

I don't think Microsoft is going to treat Nokia any better than SGI in the long run.<p>> Nokia's worst case here is more then likely getting bought vs. being left for dead like SGI.<p>... for 10% what they were worth at the time Elop gave the ""burning platform"" speech.<p>SGI was technically bought as well. That's really a bad resolution for Nokia, and is far from being a ""worst case"". If MS decides to produce phones themselves, it is likely Nokia will be left to whither and die.<p>It might look unlikely now, but unless you were in the know, just a month ago it seemed very unlikely that MS will make their own tablets.",1340474634

Bcrypt is designed to be slow, and hashing the submitted token on EVERY request would really affect performance.  Bcrypt is great for password hashing which only happens once per session.  You are probably better off securing access tokens using a fast hash (sha) and compensating for security with a long and random access token.",1340474608

I am hardly the only one. I met one guy online who grew a garden to have control over food quality for his wife, going so far as to test the soil and amend the soil to get the nutrient content he wanted. It did make a difference with her health issue.<p>You could market this as environmentally sustainable for people concerned about that issue. You could also market it as something that lets you grow your own organic health foods.<p>As for the small spice thing, that is a great place to start. Organic spices are quite expensive. You can briefly note it will pay for itself over time but frame that as a ""bonus"". The appeal for people willing to buy organic is that this the freshest possible spice, picked from the vine mere seconds before adding it to your recipe. Having it in your kitchen means it is fresher than anything you coukd bring in from the back yard.<p>I have known people who grew their own cilantro to use it as an alternative treatment. These are the type of people who would buy something like this. You would be in the business of making it easier to be a control freak defending themselves from living in a toxic world and also in the business of making the world less toxic by letting people grow their own locally, eliminating transport pollution, eliminating chemical fertilizer, etc.",1340474508

7732186,comment,7731624,7731624,7,0,kyzyl,,,"Okay, here&#x27;s my attempt to distill things a bit. Now, I&#x27;m not very old, but my time putzing about this field has taught me that there are two components to carrying on successfully: experience, and communication.<p>Right now I run a company where we do science. To do our science, we have to write a ton of code. Web stuff, server deployments, numerical analysis, machine learning, hardware description, USB drivers, data visualization, you name it. Over the years I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at picking the right level of abstraction for the job, and it&#x27;s served me very well. The key is to have foresight about your situation, and foresight only gets better with experience. When I see one of the less experienced engineers at work doing something dubious, it&#x27;s usually very easy to steer them away from danger. That&#x27;s the experience bit; somebody has to know better, and has to act on it.<p>But knowing better isn&#x27;t enough. If you want your academic lab to use better coding practices, you knowing better and flatly telling them to change their ways will never work. You have to convince them that they want to do it. If you can&#x27;t come up with an argument for the use of your other language, or design paradigm, or SCM software that is both factually solid <i>and contextually relevant enough</i>, then 9 times out of 10 you are probably not hitting on the right solution. That doesn&#x27;t meant that your lab director who is refusing to change is correct in his refusal, but I&#x27;ll bet you if you pitched upon a solution that was right for the situation, and put some thought into your explanation, you would get a <i>much</i> better reception. The same principle applies when you&#x27;re pitching a new methodology out in non-academic land, it&#x27;s just that more often than not both parties&#x27; expectations are already closer to being in alignment.<p>Why does it work? Because most people in these types of environments, such as academic coding circles, are really quite smart. If something is sensible and sufficiently low friction, they will probably go for it. So, no, bad scientific code doesn&#x27;t beat &#x27;best practices&#x27;. But a good solution beats a bad solution every.fucking.time. If you can&#x27;t show people that it&#x27;s a good solution, it&#x27;s probably not the right thing to do. Even if your idea <i>is</i> the better one, if you haven&#x27;t convinced the people who are going to have to deal with it of this fact, they won&#x27;t understand it, they will misuse it, mess it up, screw up their research and they will blame the software engineer. And they&#x27;d be at least partially correct in doing so, because you only painted half the house.<p>I&#x27;d end by saying &#x27;It&#x27;s really not rocket science&#x27;, but... it really might be. ;-)",1399895825

7732183,comment,7731624,7731894,19,0,danso,,,"This is true in finance and in other data-heavy fields as well. I&#x27;ve been shocked at the kinds of Excel sheets that, with a mess of spaghetti VB code written by someone long gone, factors into trades worth millions...sure, it &quot;works&quot;...but besides the very minor question of code elegance, who knows what optimization of returns could be made if the code wasn&#x27;t such a fright that a knowledgable partner could tweak and experiment with it? Or that it was abstracted enough to be applied to the other kinds of trades that the firm is making (but hell what do I know, I&#x27;m not as rich as my hedge fund friends)?<p>What&#x27;s particularly annoying is working with analysts who have a system of pasting SQL scripts from a (hand-labeled-versioned) text file to perform the necessary data-munging/pivoting for in-house use...their SQL work is, to be fair, so much of a leap forward from however such bulk data work was being done previously that they take offense when I offer to help them automate the work...as if their system of hand-pasting/executing scripts, then eyeballing the results for an hour to spot-check it, was inherently more reliable than a batch script with well-defined automated test parameters...What they fail to see is that it&#x27;s not just about faster/better error-checking, but it&#x27;s about more flexible analysis and output. Once the process has been abstracted, instead of producing one &quot;clean&quot; giant database that is faceted along one dimension (time, perhaps), the script can loop through and spit out a variety of useful permutaitons, which would be impossible/insanity if you stick with the hand-tweaked process.<p>That&#x27;s the problem I see with the OP...A scientist can recognize when something seems to work, when it comes to the domain of programming and structure, but &quot;what works&quot; may simply be &quot;what seems to work better than what I did last time&quot;...which is not a foolproof standard of evaluation",1399895785

This is one of the classical examples of convergent evolution. \nFrom: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution#Eyes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution#Eyes</a><p>> <i>One of the most well-known examples of convergent evolution is the camera eye of cephalopods (e.g., squid), vertebrates (e.g., mammals) and cnidaria (e.g., box jellies).[22] Their last common ancestor had at most a very simple photoreceptive spot, but a range of processes led to the progressive refinement of this structure to the advanced camera eye — with one subtle difference: The cephalopod eye is &quot;wired&quot; in the opposite direction, with blood and nerve vessels entering from the back of the retina, rather than the front as in vertebrates.[8] The similarity of the structures in other respects, despite the complex nature of the organ, illustrates how there are some biological challenges (e.g. vision) that have an optimal solution.</i><p>More info: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalopod_eye"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalopod_eye</a>",1399895777

Or the way I interpreted it, anyway. That is &quot;road to hell is paved with good intentions&quot;. I have to deal with it on daily basis. There is some legacy code in the project considered to be bad and always referred to as that. And, well, yeah, it <i>is</i> bad.

Twitter removed the &quot;block&quot; because &quot;blocking&quot; someone gave the blocker a false sense of security...you can never hide your activity from a stalker who simply logs out and views your public timeline.<p>&quot;Block&quot; effectively does nothing...what Twitter should&#x27;ve done is label the button something like &quot;Ignore&quot;...which would allow you to never be notified when that user sends a direct reply or mentions you...but would not have the same connotation as actively blocking that person in the way that a restraining order &quot;blocks&quot; someone.<p>As much as Twitter is seen as a superficial surface, nothing more than a dumbed-down micro version of blogging...the technicalities that underly its open nature is something that is hard to grok until you actively use it.

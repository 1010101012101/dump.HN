You still need foundations. Yes, you can make it work. No, it&#x27;s not always suitable - right tool for the job.<p>Much like other alternate building techniques (straw bale, etc.) it faces significant regulatory challenges in many jurisdictions due to a lack of familiarity with structural properties and the variable nature of the inputs (what type of clay, straw, etc.). Usually it&#x27;s cost prohibitive to try in cities, because the labour costs are higher. In those situations, prefabbing concrete/other types of slabs and dragging them on site can be a really fast and cheapish way (though environmentally questionable) to get a house up.

For example, explaining that someone won&#x27;t get a good reference if he sues is almost certainly illegal (extortion). Of course, any reasonable person would know not to use a company that one is suing as a reference. You&#x27;d do better to say, &quot;I&#x27;m not using them as a reference because I&#x27;m suing them&quot; (since it&#x27;s already a matter of public record) than to use them. Still, saying, &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t sue us because <retaliation>&quot; is on the wrong side of the law.<p>That said, I agree that PIPs are the worst. They&#x27;re a way for scummy managers in scummy companies to... well, the common explanation is that they&#x27;re a lawsuit shield, but that&#x27;s not really true because it&#x27;s actually harder to run a lawsuit-proof PIP than to just fire someone. The real purpose of the PIP is less documented and more insidious.<p>Companies don&#x27;t actually fear lawsuits that much. They&#x27;re a black-swan risk, but less than 1% of people fired will ever litigate. They&#x27;re much more worried about disparagement and impaired relationships. You write a generous severance and give a good reference (which you should, in most cases) when things don&#x27;t work out because, if you do things right, the odds are good that the person&#x27;s career will go unimpeded, and this pays off for you because they&#x27;re likely to feel good about that episode in their careers and say good things about you in the future.<p>The purpose of a generous severance and positive reference is to make the fired employee feel good about the company, preventing any sort of moral indignation. The purpose of a PIP is to make the employee feel bad about himself (under a parallel theory that a humiliated employee will feel weak, not morally superior, and therefore not disparage or litigate). It has almost no legal value, because wrongful PIPs are just as common as wrongful terminations. Its purpose is to shame the employee into silence. Of course, it often doesn&#x27;t work, but that&#x27;s a discussion for another time.<p>PIPs (which, considering morale, are far more expensive than severance payments) are also a common way for HR offices to claim they &quot;saved money&quot; on severance payments when they&#x27;re actually externalizing the costs to the manager, who has to conduct a kangaroo court, and the team, which has to deal with an already-fired employee coming into work for 2 months.",1431960234

Sometimes the acquirer&#x27;s resources are the key to making great progress. I&#x27;d happily call that a success. More often, either nothing changes or the acquirer makes a hash of it, in which case I would call it a failure.<p>But yes, in the current game, people will happily claim that last sort of failure as a success.

9564587,comment,9564076,9564076,0,0,STRML,,,"Great article; a few things I would add. I use bluebird for Promises, which is just the most fantastic Promises lib ever conceived, no joke; if you haven&#x27;t used it try it. So some of these may be Bluebird-specific:<p>1. Don&#x27;t wrap callback functions manually with `new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {...})`, just use `Promise.promisify(...)`. For one-off functions, try `Promise.fromNode(function(cb) { fs.readFile(&#x27;..&#x27;, cb); });`.<p>2. This pattern:<p><pre><code>  getUserByName(&#x27;nolan&#x27;).then(function (user) {\n    return getUserAccountById(user.id);\n  }).then(function (userAccount) {\n    // I got a user account!\n  });\n\n</code></pre>\nCould be:<p><pre><code>  getUserByName(&#x27;nolan&#x27;)\n  .get(&#x27;id&#x27;)\n  .then(getUserAccountById) \n  .then(function (userAccount) {\n    // I got a user account!\n  });\n</code></pre>\n3. I too used Promise.resolve().then(...) to start a lot of route handlers. Try `Promise.try(function() {...})`, which is equivalent but reduces the temptation to just stick a synchronous value in the `Promise.resolve()` just because you can.<p>4. `Promise#nodeify()` is <i>super</i> useful for creating functions that return promises or use callbacks depending on how they&#x27;re called. For example:<p><pre><code>  function getUserName(id, cb) {\n    return db.getUserAsync(id).get(&#x27;name&#x27;)\n    .nodeify(cb);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIs the same as:<p><pre><code>  function getUserName(id, cb) {\n    var promise = db.getUserAsync(id).get(&#x27;name&#x27;);\n    if (!cb) return promise;\n    promise.then(function(result) { cb(null, result);})\n    .catch(function(e) { cb(e); });\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThis is great if you want to convert a few functions you use to promises, but they&#x27;re called elsewhere and expect a callback style.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are many more. This is my bible: <a href=""https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/blob/master/API.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/blob/master/API.md</a><p>In short; use Promises! They are the answer for callback hell in Node. Async/await may fix more problems in the future but if you want Node/Browser compatibility and to get started right now, Promises are the best way to go.",1431959051

I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s worth the price without considering the deep phone integration.  I considered reinstalling the factory head unit (a Scion Bespoke w/ navigation), but I had sold it before I could come to a decision.<p>CarPlay would work great if Siri worked well, but I&#x27;ve never been able to get Siri to work well in the car or elsewhere (and that assumes Siri is taking requests at the moment).  Text-to-speech works fine; dictation is a constant frustration.

I don&#x27;t recall the erroneous outputs generated by Siri, but they weren&#x27;t even close.  After multiple tries, I had to give up.  The Maps colors are idiotically low contrast and it can be very difficult to see what current traffic conditions are as a result.  The zoom levels in Maps never seem to be right, either too much or too little.  The touch interface itself requires too much attention to use and is a car accident waiting to happen.<p>CarPlay has a long way to go before it is competitive with iDrive, MyFord Touch, or Uvo, which are the systems that I&#x27;ve experienced.  My experience with CarPlay makes me question how much testing it actually got while installed in cars with people driving, because there&#x27;s a lot of glaring usability problems and general interface quirks that should have been caught during testing.<p>I used to think that CarPlay, Android Auto, and MirrorLink were going to destroy the car maker&#x27;s infotainment systems.  After using CarPlay, I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s going to be a while before that happens, if ever. The car manufacturers have a lot of experience with &quot;car UX&quot; and aren&#x27;t standing still with their own products.  Infotainment is also a minor part of the entire car ownership and use experience, and I don&#x27;t know that I can think of anyone that bought or leased a car because &quot;it has iDrive&quot; or whatever.

9564522,comment,9564281,9564281,0,0,Lawtonfogle,,,"I&#x27;ve been moving more and more to the notion that freedom of speech is an all or nothing proposition.  On a technical level when dealing with systems that protect the transfer of information such as encryption, this is an absolute, because the technology that provides the security (and thus freedom) cares not the content and any backdoor would destroy all integrity regardless of how it is used.  But there has been a notion that laws, rights, and duties do not have the same requirement.  We can build compromises in the laws, so we should be able to create a system where only the stuff that should be banned is banned and all other speech is free, no?  But now I doubt that, as any ban sacrifices the integrity of the entire system.  Maybe in theory it is still possible, but as many of us have seen time and time again, theory and practice differ far more in practice than in theory.<p>From this, I&#x27;ve moved to adopting an ever stricter view of all speech as being free.  I will not say it is perfect as it does have flaws.  But the flaws are a small price to pay to ensure one of the axiomatic rights is defended.  For without free speech, we lose the power to criticize, to discuss, to be democratic.<p>While I know the author isn&#x27;t regarded quite as highly in the UK and the US, I think the following passage captures the importance of the exchange of information being free.<p>>The basis of our governments being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.",1431958421

What you sometimes end up with as a result is a concise yet easy to understand notation with a small set of rules to remember, as opposed to ad-hoc rules that can be overridden at any point for the author&#x27;s convenience[2].

It is simple to compose expressions, as opposed to <i>statements</i> which you typically just make longer lists of or stuff into procedures.<p>PS: Do note some researcher&#x27;s/Haskell programmers fondness of writing &quot;Haskell&quot; as <i>mathematical</i> LaTeX - things like replacing certain standard operators for prettier ones, like replacing `.` with the dot-operator more usually associated with function composition.

9564441,comment,9564010,9564188,0,0,vidarh,,,"For C/C++ all that is usually needed is to implement a few helper functions.<p>E.g. the quicksort example is one of my favourite pet peeves, because the <i>reason</i> the C version sorts in place is that the archetypical C implementation after Hoare sorts in place.<p>Many of the FP versions of quicksorts like this end up requiring a lot of additional memory. Maybe it is becoming reasonable to assume they will optimise it into an in-place sort these days, but it didn&#x27;t use to be.<p>Meanwhile, with a couple of small, generic helper functions, you can get down to nearly the same complexity in C/C++. For C++ the only helper you absolutely need to cut down on the verbosity has been a part of the standard library since C++98<p>I wrote a blog post about this back in 2005 [1] about one of the other typical Haskell quicksort examples, and referenced an article by Alexandrescu that gave an example implementation of quicksort in C++ with the (generic) partitioning, as well as the pivot selection split out that looks like this:<p><pre><code>        template <class Iter>\n        void Sort(Iter b, Iter e)\n        {\n          const pair<Iter, Iter> midRange = Partition(b, e, SelectPivot(b, e));\n          Sort(b, midRange.first);\n          Sort(midRange.second, e);\n        }\n</code></pre>\nYou can do the same in C easily enough. So what Haskell had over C/C++ in this respect was mainly a more expressive standard library. C++ has long had std::partition(), so it can be done entirely with the standard library too if you&#x27;re willing to do the same (bad) fixed/dumb pivot selection that the typical Haskell versions (as well as the archetypical C version) use.<p>Unfortunately the link to the CUJ article is dead, as it was a quite  fascinating walk through optimising sorting (including better pivot selection).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.hokstad.com/archives/2005/03/about_haskell_a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hokstad.com/archives/2005/03/about_haskell_a</a>",1431957806

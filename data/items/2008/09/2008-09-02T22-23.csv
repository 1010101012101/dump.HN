293336,comment,293223,293223,0,0,rcoder,,,"Seeing that cross-platform support really is in progress (albeit incomplete) and not just a hypothetical goal reassures me that Google is truly serious about seeing Chrome become a sustainable open-source project.<p>My initial fear upon hearing the release announcement was that this was intended exclusively as a salvo against IE8 on Windows, and that Google just wanted to further needle Microsoft. If they're willing to invest engineering resources in support for less-dominant platforms, it suggests very strongly that they really do want to drive the state of the art for browser implementations forward across the board.",1220396023

Downloading the ""installer"" doesn't download the complete software.<p>2. Installer presents everything in Norwegian, with no choice of English. I want my software in English, end of story. There is no way to select English, so for now I assume this is based on some Windows locale-settings which I will just configure properly after install.<p>3. Configuration hangs to the point of me almost killing the process. After eating a few minutes worth of 100% CPU time, Chrome launches. No feedback is given during this period that it is actually working on anything at all.<p>4. Once running, Chrome is still in Norwegian mode.<p>5. Options (or ""Alternativer"") shows no way to select a English UI language.<p>6. The language-pack seems to include a spell-checking. This entire text-box is filled with red lines. Because this is not written in Norwegian.<p>7. Scrolling trough this small text-box proceeds to scroll down the entire page when I reach the end. With what seems like 200 lines of scrolling per millimeter on my laptop touchpad, this renders the scrolling area basically useless for edits. This also applies to page-down in textboxes. Very, very, very annoying.<p>8. Scrolling in general scrolling seems way too fast also. Like 2-3 pages on what should be 1.<p>Out of the box this is <i>not</i> something I am happy with, and this needs to be improved about 100 times from second 1.<p>A few simple choices (like language) must be added. Better reporting to the user that something is actually being worked on needs to be present. Configurability is shit. It has a <i>task manager</i> for web-page tabs (i.e. ""geek stuff""), but wont let you configure basic stuff like if opening links in new tabs should activate them or not.<p>I'm going to have to <i>uninstall</i> this now and try to get hold of a English version.<p>Edit: The language thingie evidently can be fixed without reinstalling. I just couldn't find it with the non computing-standard language used in the options dialog.<p>Edit 2: Now I find that google search always presents me the <i>Norwegian</i> version, not the english, when searching from the url-bar. Despite having ""I want google in english"" cookies firmly set.<p>This is bloody annoying. Stop forcing localization on me damnit!",1220393035

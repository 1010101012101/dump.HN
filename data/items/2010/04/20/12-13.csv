It should be infrastructure, not features.  <i>Libraries</i> are the proper object of focus.   Libraries can be modified, forked, debugged without dividing a language community. Doing that to a programming language syntax weakens and divides such communities. In contrast, those actions on libraries actually strengthen programming language communities.",1271768370

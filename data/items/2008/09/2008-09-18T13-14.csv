It eliminates fuel consumption altogether, so that the system functions as a pure storage facility. They call it Advanced Adiabatic CAES.<p>The idea for AACAES is that, in the charge cycle, hot compressed air is passed through a counter-flow heat exchanger before being sent to its storage cavern. The compressed air transfers its heat to a thermal storage fluid, which then enters a well-insulated storage tank of its own. In the discharge cycle, both flows are reversed, and the cool compressed air from the storage cavern recovers most of the heat it gave up before being stored. The now-hot compressed air exiting the heat exchanger drives an expander turbine to generate power.<p>If the heat exchanger and thermal storage work well, then efficiencies approaching those achieved with pumped hydroelectric storage should be possible.</i>",1221745618

Maybe it's the McCain campaign doing some vetting. Maybe it's some journalist requesting a copy of Trig's birth certificate. I actually think it's unlikely to be official business -- if you need documents from the governor's office you probably request them from a low-level official, not from the governor herself.<p>""Confidential: ethics investigation"" could be personal too -- if she's under investigation and has hired a lawyer, for instance, then communications with that lawyer should be protected under client/lawyer privilege and shouldn't be a matter of public record.<p>I""m not sure exactly where the dividing line is between personal and official email for government officials -- I expect it's blurry, having been defined in a law somewhere but never tested in court.",1221745254

308144,comment,307805,308043,0,0,savrajsingh,,,"So there are two types of products. Products that are new, never-before-seen ideas, and products that are big twists or features added to existing products.<p>If you are building a new product, build the simplest thing possible to complete the use case. Don't worry about the fonts or ajax, don't worry about anything other than 'did we meet our core scenario -- did the user get what he/she wanted?'  And then test this on the user -- does this help you?<p>If you are building a tweak or revision of some existing thing, go for the out-there features and see if those actually stick to users.  If you are writing a new blogging platform, for example, it's expected that you'll be able to add, remove, and edit posts, and you'll have a great RSS feed. Users will assume you'll have that, and if you don't  have it right now, you'll add it.  In this case, build the parts that are truly novel.  And then check this with your users -- is this something they want?<p>A good example is Zenter (YC startup acquired by google).  They didn't build the ""save"" feature into their web presentation app until very late because it's assumed that you can save a presentation -- they instead focused on the cool stuff that people didn't expect -- collaborating on the web on your presentation, sharing it live, etc.<p>The bottom line is, build the minimum form of the unique thing first, and see if it sticks.  Don't worry about being too simple -- your users will let you know if you don't meet their needs.",1221743999

What it means is that certain sets of symbols cannot be parsed unambiguously without information generated during the parse itself (the grammar is not context-free).<p>The link in the sibling comment has the canonical example:<p>foo * bar;<p>can either be parsed a multiplication or a declaration depending on whether ""foo"" has been typedefed previously.

It can, and psychologists routinely think of the SAT that way. Despite a number of statements to the contrary in the various comments here, taking SAT scores as an informative correlate (proxy) of what psychologists call ""general intelligence"" is a procedure often found in the professional literature of psychology, with the warrant of studies specifically on that issue. Note that it is standard usage among psychologists to treat ""general intelligence"" as a term that basically equates with ""scoring well on IQ tests and good proxies of IQ tests,"" which is the point of some of the comments here.<p><a href=""http://www.iapsych.com/iqmr/koening2008.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iapsych.com/iqmr/koening2008.pdf</a><p>""Frey and Detterman (2004) showed that the SAT was correlated with measures of general intelligence .82 (.87 when corrected for nonlinearity)""<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3144549/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3144549/</a><p>""Indeed, research suggests that SAT scores load highly on the first principal factor of a factor analysis of cognitive measures; a finding that strongly suggests that the SAT is g loaded (Frey & Detterman, 2004).""<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/12/04/why-should-sats-matter/the-sat-is-a-good-intelligence-test"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/12/04/why-should-s...</a><p>""Furthermore, the SAT is largely a measure of general intelligence.

Stanovich makes the interesting point that there are very strong correlations with IQ scores and SAT scores with some of what everyone regards as ""smart"" behavior (and which psychologists by convention call ""general intelligence"") while there are still other kinds of tests that plainly have indisputable right answers that high-IQ people are able to muff. Thus Stanovich distinguishes ""intelligence"" (essentially, IQ) from ""rationality"" (making correct decisions that overcome human cognitive biases) as distinct aspects of human cognition.

If you don't think about race conditions while coding, you shouldn't be using a concurrent language.<p>This is the same for anything. For example, a webserver written in C++ that uses pthreads might have a #define that determines the number of threads in the thread pool. If the default is 1 and nobody changes this in development, it should not break when someone changes it to 2 or 3, otherwise the code is wrong.<p>As for your argument about Java, there's nothing you can do in Java that you can't do in assembly. This argument is invalid. Go's strength is in making complex things simple. For example, if you wanted to build a distributed system (across machines), in Go you just use ""net/rpc"" it would handle it for you. In Java, you'd have like 3 layers of abstract classes that define a serializable type, you'd make some kind of listener class that receives responses from an RPC call, and do tons of other boilerplate. In Go, you just make a function call. That's it.<p>What exactly can't you do in Go that you can do in Go? Maybe generics, but that just complicates code unnecessarily most of the time. Sure, I've done my share of generic programming, but I've also written non-trivial, several thousand LOC programs in Go, and my Go code was much simpler and easier to read.<p>BTW, Java sucks for concurrent programming. I hate that stupid Runnable interface (or whatever they call it these days). I'd much rather have a bunch of functions that can be called synchronously, or in a go-routine and have simple checks in place to eliminate race conditions.",1351308927

But I also know people in China who have told me very explicitly, ""If China had a free press, the Communist Party would only last a week."" As information flows in, desire for freedom expands. The common people in China already do not enjoy ""stability."" By acknowledgement of the official Chinese press, instances of social instability (street protests and even riots) number in the many thousands each year, as peasants are displaced from their homes in land grabs by the local dictators, and as official corruption and party control of the police and the courts deny people recourse when their rights are violated. People I've met in China were embarrassed by the situation there already in 1982, the first time I was there, and they are losing hope that the current economic advancement is bringing with it political freedom. That is just what happened in Taiwan. People eventually gained the courage to demand their rights. I remember lots of people in both places who told me about their desire for freedom long, hard years before that freedom was won in Taiwan. Taiwan's example will point the way for people in China. They can have democracy and a free press if they stand up together.<p>Chinese social scientists are deeply frightened by the huge wealth disparities between the differing regions of China, which are greater than those that existed in Yugoslavia before Yugoslavia disintegrated.

They also tested people with ""causal detail"" explanations that had relevant explanations. The understanding scores were higher for causal explanations than non-causal.<p>Example non-causal:<p>""The post-free beater is made from a steel alloy, which is made by combining iron ore with small amounts of chromium and aluminum under very high heat. This reduces mixing time.""<p>Causal detail:<p>""Without a center post to hinder movement of the ingredients, a vortex is created within the beater that forces dry ingredients to dissolve more easily, thereby reducing mixing time.""<p>Causal details resulted in more understanding, as one would expect.<p>They also tested for several different levels of detail. The highest level for beaters was this:<p>""Without a center post to interfere with movement, liquid molecules move uniformly within the beater creating a lot of spin. This forces dry particles into suspension in the liquid, thereby reducing mixing time.""<p>Rather than say ""dissolve"" they say ""force into suspension in the liquid"". Self evaluation of understanding went down for both groups once it got to that level. It seems clear to me that ""force into suspension in the liquid"" is less clear and provides no real additional details beyond ""dissolve"", which contributes to the confusion. It's not that people don't like technical details, it's that the explanation is actually less clear.<p>Compare also the explanations for white saran wrap being better because it blocks light:<p>intermediate: ""The white coloring reflects light waves that would otherwise break down the amino acids that maintain the structure and freshness of the food, thereby keeping food fresh for longer.""<p>detailed: ""Atoms in the tinting agent oscillate when hit by light waves causing them to absorb the energy and reflect it back rather than reaching food where it would break the bonds holding amino acids together, thereby keeping food fresh for longer.<p>""Atoms in the tinting agent oscillate when hit by light waves causing them to absorb the energy and reflect it back"" is cool, but ""The white coloring reflects"" is really a better way to explain it. Dropping down to the level of atoms in the wrap itself doesn't convey more relevant detail, it just obscures the meaning at this level. (Covering how the photons break amino acid bonds by causing molecules to shift configuration to handle the extra electrons created from the photon collisions might have been a better way to go hard core in the ""detailed"" level since that speaks more to the mechanism.)<p>The non-causal explanation for this one was ""The cling wrap uses a white tinting agent which is composed of a mixture of titanium dioxide molecules and other binding agents. This keeps food fresh for longer."" This fails to include the detail about light breaking down amino acids leading to less fresh food, so it introduces confusion since the TiO2 detail is less relevant than the amino acid detail. And as one would expect, fewer people felt they understood what was going on with this explanation than when the actual causal chain was presented.<p>In summary, the arstechnica article's example was selected incorrectly as it was from a different part of the study than what the arstechnica author was discussing at the time: he looked at Table 2 which dealt with experiment 3 rather than Table 1 which covered all phases including Experiment 1.<p>Also, in Experiment 2 where they tested whether people would be more likely to pay more for a premium product with additional features the curves for low CRT people were not linear. It went down from 4.3 to 3.1 with intermediate explanations, but back up to 3.4 with detailed explanations. This also suggests the possibility that it is not explanations but inadequate explanations that are confusing for some people.<p>Also relevant is that in Experiment 1 the level by which which reported understanding went down by ""Low CRT"" people was quite modest, only from 5.5 to 5.0 as explanations went from shallow to detailed. It should also be mentioned it went down slightly for high CRT people as well, from around 6.0 to 5.9 or so. (Estimates since I'm eyeballing the graph in the article.)<p>Finally, an extremely relevant detail is that when going from no detail to some detail, both understanding and product preference went up for BOTH groups.<p>Consider the example of bandaids with bubbles compared to bandaids without bubbles.<p>no detail: ""The bubbles help cuts heal faster.""<p>shallow detail: ""The bubbles increase air circulation around the wound, thereby killing bacteria. This causes cuts to heal faster.""<p>detailed: ""The bubbles push the padding away from the wound allowing air to circulate. Oxygen in the air interferes with the metabolic processes of many bacteria, killing them and allowing the wound to heal faster.""<p>Understanding goes from 3.5 to 5.5 for the low-CRT people and 2.2 to 4.5 for the high-CRT people. Some detail is better for everybody, and I would even say that the level of detail given here is sufficient for many to posit a more complete explanation, or at least find one through research if curious. Whereas the no detail explanation offers nothing, it might as well define energy as ""energy makes things go"" and it's certainly expected that this would result in the least understanding across the board.<p>Product preference goes from 3.9 to 4.3 for low-CRT people when we go from no detail to shallow. And 3.1 to 3.5 for high-CRT. So everyone benefits from a reasonable level of causal information.<p>This is extremely different from the vibe given by the article, which suggested that saying ""it's blue"" or ""it's newfangled"" was all you needed. That is not correct, that level of explanation performed the worst for all subjects in both understanding and product preference.<p>There's also a fourth Experiment in the paper. It should be addressed, but mostly to note that it is quite different from the rest. Subjects were presented with four products that were considerably less familiar than bandages and washing soap. They were given shallow explanations taken from product marketing literature, asked to rate their understanding, and then were ambushed with a demand to write a detailed essay describing in precise scientific detail exactly how the product actually worked, step by step. After this ""exercise"", not only did their evaluation of their own understanding go down (obviously), but the non-CRT people became quite hostile to the product itself and were much less likely to buy it.<p>Recall that in Experiment 2 these same people liked products more when proceeding from no explanation to a shallow one. In this experiment they did NOT test how willing they were to buy it after explaining it and before ambushing them, they only tested how willing they were to buy after ambushing them. The experimenters conclude that the explanation caused them to be less likely to buy. This is a plainly absurd conclusion and the experimenters have to realize this. It was the ambushing and demand that the person provide an essay describing the detailed workings of the product after forcing them to state whether they understood it or not that made them angry that is the cause here. This also is a scenario that is never found in actual consumer purchasing workflow, and quite irrelevant to marketing other than to tell you it is a mistake to corner your customer and demand explanations of them of how your product works after asking them if they understand it. All that does is embarrass them. Yes, the high-CRT people did well with the the exam and were more likely to buy, but obviously this is because they did understand how it worked. This experiment is completely disconnected from the important observation that a cursory, accurate and functional explanation of product benefits improved desirability of the product.",1351308639

But in truth there is no ""right"", just <i>progressively less wrong</i>, and there are multiple undesirable consequences of the emphasis of the former in our education system (from rigid beliefs that can't evolve with new data, to people getting dejecting with fields like hard sciences when they can't be ""right"" easily):<p><a href=""http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/sci_cult/lesswrong/lesswrong/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/sci_cult/lesswrong/lesswrong/</a><p><i>""People in our culture, by and large, tend to presume that someone, somewhere knows what is ""right,"" and that each individual's task is either to be that particular someone or to work as hard as they can to learn from that someone what ""right"" is ... the mindset long predates science as a social activity, but ... science certainly encourages it, and so it is appropriate that science should contribute to correcting it ...<p>In an enormous variety of distinct fields of inquiry the same general pattern is becoming clear: there is no such thing as ""right,"" the very concept needs to be replaced with ""progressively less wrong."" The difference is far from semantic. ""Right"" is measured by proximity to some fixed idea, ""progressively less wrong"" by how far people have gotten from where they started. It is the aspiration to be ""right"" that leads to rigid hierarchical social organizations of all kinds, including educational systems. Wanting to be ""progressively less wrong"" takes one (and societies) in quite different directions entirely: it encourages life-long inquiry by every individual, a respect for past wisdom and enthusiasm for contributing to future understanding, and an appreciation of the enormous value of interactions between unique individuals each of whom has unique perspectives to contribute.""</i>",1351308204

It's not really practical to give examples of that when you can't open-source the app; you could maybe do a few trivial snippets or put it all behind a big thick NDA, but neither method works very well.",1351306972

I definitely understand why a push notification API would be a bad idea, but is polling with Last-Modified really the state of the art in notification APIs? What if you want to find out almost instantly when an event occurs, and not just at the granularity of your poll interval? At the API level, what do people use for this? Comet-style long polling? WebSockets? pubsubhubbub?",1351306969

Obviously, grades in general aren't the best metric, but they're simple and generally pretty reliable.<p>If I were hiring somebody, I'd look at a combination of test scores and personal achievements. If I were hiring a programmer, I'd filter by test scores, then look at examples of projects the applicant works on/is associated with.

You can traverse a binary tree from the root to any node, and record the nodes on that path. Do so for each of the two nodes, then compare the two sequences, looking for the first node that is common to both of them. You can do this in O(lg n) if the binary tree is balanced, or O(n) if it is not. And if this sounds complicated in words, just draw a picture and it'll suddenly look simpler.",1351306861

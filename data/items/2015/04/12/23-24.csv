So you can actually start right away with the microservice oriented architecture. This will buy you a lot technically in the long-run, so it&#x27;s usually the best choice. The basic pattern is an app/api split, but it can be extended to describe other parts of your app.<p>Separation of concerns at macro scale is a great idea just like it is at functional level.

We now live in a world in which marching on the streets, political protests, and demonstrations are immediately met with a militarized response sanctioned by the FUD of terrorism. The shift, the first protest in this new era, was likely 1999 WTO protests in Seattle, WA. Since then, the whole enterprise has become a game or dance: people march on the streets, the police crack down and drum up support for new, better military gear. Anonymous, for whatever your stance on their questionable politics, was interesting precisely because it offered an alternative to this dance.

It seems though, that you haven&#x27;t really read what I wrote throughout this entire thread.<p>I have always agreed that the password policy was very poor/negligent and that the school should do better in this regard.<p>I have <i>never</i> argued that the student should be punished for all potential havoc he could have wreaked. I stated this multiple times throughout the thread!<p>Once again i&#x27;ll try to make my argument as simple and clear as possible:<p>1. The potential for harm when a student takes surreptitious control over a teacher&#x27;s computer is high<p>2. It therefore follows that a student actively working to take control (via keylogger or by observing the typed pw) is itself a serious issue.<p>The changing of the desktop background is irrelevant. The unauthorized use of a computer is the main issue from the perspective of the school.<p>The previous commenter with whom I was discussing implied that the actions were a &quot;harmless prank&quot; and reading between the lines implied that the punishment should have been a cheerful ruffling of his hair and saying with a mock voice &quot;now that was a bit naughty wasn&#x27;t it Johnny? Lets not do that again! hahaha what a silly pranker you are!&quot;<p>The article stated that the student will be facing felony charges.<p>My position is that the actions sat somewhere in the middle of these 2 extremes! Simply accessing a teacher&#x27;s computer is a serous enough action that the student should suffer some type of reasonable school-based punishment. In my previous post i outlined that these can wildly range in severity from a simple letter right through to expulsion if dealing with a recidivist.<p>It really is hard for me to understand the confusion here.<p>and once again. I&#x27;m not defending the school&#x27;s use of insecure passwords. I&#x27;m saying that regardless of their poor choice, a student who is actively working to undermine a teacher&#x27;s account should face a fair and reasonable punishment that is more than a slap on the wrist and less than a felony charge.<p>I really can&#x27;t make it clearer than this I think.",1428882538

I recommend scaling to some large integer multiple of the original size with nearest neighbor, and then scaling to the correct aspect ratio with your favorite resampling filter. And if you insist on using JPEG compression then at least use 4:4:4 chroma subsampling - chroma artifacts are very obvious in pixel art.<p>I also dispute the assertion that CRT artifacts were required or intended by all graphics designer back then. Evidence: LCD based portable systems and line doubled mode 13h DOS games both used the same dithering techniques, but they had sharp pixels. And many games used dithering type patterns to represent fine detail instead of blended colors, eg. the typewriter in the background near the start of Chrono Trigger. I grew up with DOS games so I personally prefer sharp pixels.<p>The most important feature of a CRT is the low persistence - eliminating sample and hold blur. This is now available in fast modern LCDs with strobing backlights, or with black frame insertion displaying 60Hz content on a 120Hz monitor. It makes a very big difference for fast scrolling 2D games.",1428881721

9365095,comment,9365076,9365076,0,0,a3voices,,,"I think the best you can possibly do is 2x your current compensation as an engineer given ideal circumstances. The older engineers who make a ton are probably really good at job hopping and/or negotiating, in addition to working hard consistently and being smart. I also suspect they orchestrate situations where they work for managers who they have a good relationship with, so the chances they get promoted are greater. I think another key factor is they become a scarce resource to the company, i.e. the only person who really knows the entire stack, which gives them leverage. Another possible factor is day-to-day they prioritize visible work for which they&#x27;d get future recognition. One highly paid engineer I knew also seemed good at building relationships with everyone.<p>The only way to truly beat the system financially is to get early equity in a startup that becomes very successful.",1428880454

The same way it&#x27;s involved in any business arrangement where a contract was signed.<p>But, if you want to compare marriage to a business arrangement, you should also be aware that government doesn&#x27;t just manage business arrangements through <i>general</i> contract law, it defines a whole bunch of special standard forms for business entities which people form (various classes of corporations, LPs, LLPs, LLLPs, LLCs, heck, even general partnerships have a separate body of law from general contract law.)<p>So, the only way marriage is different is that government hasn&#x27;t provided a whole bunch of different special forms for couples with different priorities and goals.",1428880450

Which is harder to reason about, harder to test, and harder to get right in concurrent contexts.<p>> for higher level business objects that might have a wider dependency reach, constructor injection can become a nightmare.<p>Again, I view this as a symptom of bad design.  If you have a wide dependency reach, then using a DI container is only allowing you to increase the problem.  Using setter DI, which normally compromises the design even more, to supposedly make the design <i>better</i> is suspect.<p>I think you would be better served by fixing your high level business objects to not have a wider dependency reach, and the dependency inversion principle is one tool with which you can do that.",1428880223

9365071,comment,9364800,9364800,0,0,tadfisher,,,"This technique is very important for emulation and simulating the look of early games.<p>For example, the Genesis/Mega Drive did not support hardware alpha transparency. Many games (including the Sonic series) simulate the effect by alternating vertical lines, and relying on the &quot;visual munging&quot; of CRTs to produce a convincing effect. Here is a video that demonstrates the effect in Shinobi 3: <a href=""https://youtu.be/YFOkbfpIlaY?t=2m52s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/YFOkbfpIlaY?t=2m52s</a><p>(You can also notice the stippled pattern in the pool of water to the right, used to produce the same effect.)<p>Another technique is the use of stippling to simulate smooth textures and surfaces. For example, this screenshot of the Super Metroid start screen looks pretty terrible by modern standards: <a href=""http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1093273-super_metroid___title_screen_550x.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1093273-...</a><p>This would have looked much more convincing on a CRT display. Without simulating CRT distortion, you are not getting the same visual experience one would have had when running the game on hardware it was designed for. For modern games looking to simulate this experience, using these techniques along with a CRT shader will be very effective at bringing back the home console experience of the 80s and 90s.",1428879836

9365067,comment,9363635,9364162,0,0,breuleux,,,"I think it depends a lot on the language&#x27;s syntax and what sugar it offers. I believe there are choices you can make that make closures superior to objects in every possible way.<p>Consider this simple syntactic rule: `obj.x` <=> `obj(&quot;x&quot;)`. With this rule, the usual syntax for a method call, `obj.method(x)`, literally becomes the curried application of a closure, `obj(&quot;method&quot;)(x)`. You could also add a rule like `obj(x) = y` <=> `obj(set(x, y))`. Then you could define objects a bit like this:<p><pre><code>    point = (x, y) -> method ->\n        match method:\n            &quot;x&quot; -> x\n            &quot;y&quot; -> y\n            set(&quot;x&quot;, newx) -> x = newx\n            set(&quot;y&quot;, newy) -> y = newy\n            &quot;add&quot; -> (pt) -> point(x + pt.x, y + pt.y)\n    p = point(1, 2)\n    p.x = 5\n    print p.add(point(3, 4))\n</code></pre>\nAll closures. And the nice thing with that scheme is that meta-programming and reflection become completely trivial. Control over the interface is total.

4394313,comment,4393756,4393756,3,0,tmoertel,,,"Software effort estimation causes three problems. First, most estimation processes model the uncertainty about the effort required for tasks but fail to model the uncertainty about the tasks themselves, leading to unreliable estimates. Second, people are overly confident of the estimates, in any case, because the estimation process looks impressive and produces impressive looking artifacts. Third, the estimation artifacts obscure the coupling between the stakeholders and the implementers by not transmitting how the one groups decisions affect the other; the estimates, in effect, form a barrier that makes it harder for people on opposites sides of the estimates to take shared responsibility for business goals.<p>If you understand these problems and can solve them for your projects, estimation can help you to make better decisions and to allocate your resources more effectively. But, in a lot of organizations, these problems have no good solutions  (for cultural reasons), and there you might be better off not sharing your estimates if you do them.",1345161560

4394285,comment,4393817,4394069,2,0,hartez,,,"Yeah, I still don't understand the logic behind this. I've used the App Store and the Windows Phone Marketplace, and of the two I've actually bought a lot more stuff from the Marketplace. The concept of ""trial"" software where you can later upgrade to the full version if you want is built right into the Marketplace and the phone OS, so it's fairly easy for developers to offer it if they want. When confronted with several apps that do essentially the same thing, I pick up the trial version of each one and then buy the full version of the one that works best. I've bought a lot of apps this way, almost all of them <i>more</i> than $0.99. If I decide to try a new version of a different app later, I can do so with pretty much no risk.<p>Does anyone know why Apple doesn't offer this?

That doesn't require absolute estimation, but it does demand relative estimation (which he mentions tangentially at the end of the post).  If Feature A will deliver $100,000 in revenue but take 18 months and Feature B will deliver $10,000 in revenue but take 1 week, the choice is pretty obvious.  What matters is never ""return"" but always ""return on <i>investment</i>.""  If you don't know anything about the I side of the ROI equation, you're doomed to make bad decisions.  With no estimate at all, and just a snarky ""it'll take as long as it takes, shut up and let me work"" response, you'll inevitably focus on the wrong things.<p>Secondly, many of us do in fact have deadlines, and they're not just total BS.  If you have a customer that you're building something for, they have to be able to plan their own schedule, and just telling them ""well, maybe we'll ship it to you in 10/2012 or maybe in 6/2013, you'll get it when you get it"" doesn't fly.  And it's totally reasonable that it doesn't fly:  if they have to, say, install the software, or buy hardware to run it on, or train users, or migrate data from an old system, or roll out new products of their own that are dependent on the new system, they clearly can't plan or budget those activities if they have no clue whatsoever when they'll get the new system.<p>And if you do have a deadline, you kind of want to know, to the extent that you can, if you're going to make it or not so you can take corrective action (adding people, cutting scope, pushing the date) if need be.  You can't do that if you have no estimates at all.<p>Relative estimation of tasks with empirical measurement of the team's velocity works pretty well; it doesn't work in all cases, but it's pretty much always better than absolutely nothing.<p>There's a huge, huge difference between doing relative point-based estimation and date-driven, pointy-haired-boss estimation, and it's a total disservice to the software community that so many engineers seem to not really understand that difference, and seem to think that the only two options are ""unrealistic date-based estimates"" and ""no estimates.""<p>TL;DR - Don't just rant for 3000 words about how estimation is horrible and then add in one sentence about relative estimation.  You'll do the world much more good if you just help educate people how to do things the right way and spare the ranting.",1345159959
4394223,comment,4390885,4392445,4,0,justsee,,,"> The question is, can Sweden objectively and fairly litigate a rape charge involving Julian Assange?<p>No that's not the question, because 1) Assange has not been charged with anything and 2) Sweden has been offered the chance to question him in the UK (as they did in a murder case involving a trip to Serbia for questioning), or alternatively question him in Sweden, but guarantee that he will not be extradited to a third country. That they've refused all offers is a clear indication that their primary motive is not quick resolution of this particular case.<p>> If they can, the UK must honor its extradition treaty. If they can't, the UK shouldn't.<p>The UK denied an extradition request for the Chilean dictator Pinochet, whose crimes against humanity are a matter of public record. ""'If they can' the UK 'must' honor its extradition treaty"" is a statement that doesn't seem to say much at all.<p>Also, considering this situation involves the West's most famous dissident, it is important to consider all actions and irregularities in a more considered light. The issuing of the Interpol notice was highly irregular, Sweden's actions were highly political, and the Supreme Court's final consideration of the legality of the request was found to be wrong by the Cambridge Journal of International and Comparative Law:<p>The Supreme Court wrongly, and without any analysis, assumed that VCLT Article 31(3)(b) is applicable in the interpretation of secondary European acts such as the Framework Decision. It also neglected to look into the interpretative rules of the EU. The result was a fundamental mistake in the legal reasoning of the Court. [1]<p>Does a law journal's opinion take legal precedence over the final decision of a Supreme court? Of course not. Does Assange's status as a Western dissident absolve him from any transgressions? Of course not. But the totality of these highly irregular and unusual actions demonstrate a clear pattern of political persecution. The naive political / legal reduction of this case that some undertake just seems like wilful ignorance.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cjicl.org.uk/index.php?option=com_easyblog&view=entry&id=22&Itemid=101"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cjicl.org.uk/index.php?option=com_easyblog&vi...</a>",1345159939

In this model the team do not agree to a specific solution or scope, though to pick the target date at the beginning they usually have an initial solution in mind; as they work toward the date, they (working with the customer representatives in the team) have the freedom to cut features or components, or to add new ones, as they grow in their understanding of the feature and the limitations on delivery (legacy code, lack of experience, unclear business needs).

It <i>is</i> a good analogy because it addresses the unnecessary tradition of cheapness related to getting anything online even though many of those online things do provide more (and longer lasting) value than a cup of coffee. It's still an analogy, it has obvious limitations, but it's not a bad one.<p><pre><code>  Fact: Starbucks Coffee is a Trustable Experience\n</code></pre>\nCoffee isn't specific to Starbucks, and though I admit given the choice between reasonable alternatives I'll choose Starbucks by default, that still doesn't mean the experience of sitting in any coffee house is even remotely consistent. Location matters, clientele matters, it matters if the staff has a bad day or not. And in reality, no coffee house experience is 0.99 cent - it's 5 bucks or more in practice.<p><pre><code>  Fact: Your $1 App is a Total Gamble\n</code></pre>\nIt is a gamble but not as much so as, say, trying out a new coffee flavor, a new kind of pastry, a new pizza delivery service, or a million other new things you don't know anything about until you give them a spin. With apps, at least there are screenshots, feature lists, and reasonably reliable testimonials. With anything new, there is a risk. If I stick with the old stuff, I might miss out on something great. If I take a risk and explore, it might not be as good. It's a gamble.<p><pre><code>  Fact: Starbucks Has No Free Alternative\n</code></pre>\nNothing is really free. Everything costs resources to make. The price you're paying in the app store is just one aspect or this. But sure, the closest physical world analogy would be bargain-hunting, which some people spend <i>considerable</i> amounts of energy on. In the software world, there is also the danger of confusing ""free"" apps with open source apps, that would be another thing entirely.<p><pre><code>  Fact: Free Apps Are Often A Great Alternative\n</code></pre>\nNot every app idea is worthwhile. In fact, I posit that most of them are not. For stuff that is <i>really</i> obvious or trivial, free is of course the best alternative. ""Free"" is not a bad thing per se. It's just that some things do cost money to make and a lot of times, app developers need to make a living as well. In these cases, ""free"" simply doesn't work in the long term. However, I would argue that app developers are not primarily competing with ""free"" rubbish apps, their struggle is to get the customer to engage at all as opposed to doing nothing.<p><pre><code>  Fact: The Starbucks Craftsmanship Is On Full Display\n</code></pre>\nGranted, not all app stores do a good job of making stuff discoverable - but in my opinion, they <i>do</i> have sufficient UI provisions for showcasing the detailed workings of apps. I would argue that apps are in fact on full display. If customers are wise enough to make good judgement calls is another matter entirely, but the same dilemma applies to food products actually.<p><pre><code>  Fact: App Craftsmanship Is Hidden Away\n</code></pre>\nCustomers don't care how complicated your app is, the same way they don't care how much craftsmanship goes into making good coffee. Both processes are not generally known (or even of interest) to the average customer.",1345158982

The extensibility tools aren't yet present on mobile, though Free Software is beginning to make inroads.<p>While I don't think it will eliminate the paid app market, and for a large portion of the population may not (as was the case with the PC market), I suspect FS will supplant a fairly large share of paid-app opportunities.  Perhaps moreso than in the PC market of the past couple of decades as FS has garnered far wider acceptance (it was freaky even in the late 1990s, it's mainstream today).<p>Edit: wine analog.",1345158418

If your application already has more than 100,000 individual user tokens, you'll be able to maintain and add new users to your application until you reach 200% of your current user token count (as of today)  as long as you comply with our Rules of the Road.

That's unfortunate, because it's pretty bad, but more importantly: you <i>militantly miss the point of the comparison</i> when you benchmark the experience of installing a new app against the enjoyment you get from a cup of coffee.<p>This place has an enormous problem with pricing and economics. Unlike Patrick, who really does sweat the fact that developers are making small fractions of their overall worth due to underpricing their offerings, I should be overjoyed at the fact that the biggest collection of new software entrepreneurs on the Internet hangs out at a meme generation engine for exploitable market inefficiencies. But unfortunately, I'm an obnoxious nerd, so all I can think to do about this is yell. ARGH.<p>A dollar at the margin for a person with a $600 phone on a $50/mo data contract is <i>not an enormous gamble</i>. It is a pittance too trivial for that person to even contextualize. The problem isn't that people are unwilling to give up $1 for apps; it's that they're hesitant to give up $0.25 for <i>anything</i> online. When you start with the understanding that there's huge impedance at ""anything above free"", it's clear why ""$1"" is not a particularly great price point, and why ""better strategies to motivate people to part with $1"" is a terrible meme to propagate.",1345158064

The outages in 2004 weren't lengthy, were mostly DoS and got blown way out of proportion by people who thought $10/month was a kingly sum that entitled them to dedicated-server quality.  The quality of Dreamhost's shared hosting hasn't really diminished over the years and it's still perfectly adequate for low traffic PHP or even Rails sites.<p>TextDrive by contrast was founded on the principle of combatting the race to the bottom by charging a fair price and offering unparalleled power and flexibility.   This vision was sold to us by Dean Allen who had an enormously positive reputation as one of the very best early bloggers.  Funding TextDrive with these lifetime accounts was not just us chumps buying into some bottom-feeders marketing scam.  There was real intention and integrity behind this.<p>The problem was that they couldn't actually deliver this quality service despite charging a lot more for it.  I mean there was flexibility (webmin instead of cpanel, etc), and TextDrive was the first shared host supporting Ruby on Rails (in fact it was the ""official"" rails host for a while), and they were always working on awesome new tech (huge Solaris boxes, ZFS, bla bla bla).  But in the end, Jason Hoffman did not know how to build a stable hosting service.<p>Eventually after the Joyent acquisition/merger I think they figured out how to run a business, but it was <i>our</i> money that allowed them the time to learn how to do that.  The actual experience of hosting with TextDrive was always shit, and it never cease to amaze me how many hours Jason Hoffman spent posting in the forums when there was obviously a lot of urgent work that needed to be done.<p>At some point in the early history, Dean Allen went dark and largely disappeared from public view.  You'll notice that now Jason Hoffman is the Founder and there's no mention of Dean Allen, but if I recall, it was definitely a partnership, with Dean bringing the name recognition and web experience, and Jason providing the system architecture (business/technical co-founders if you will).  I don't have any inside information about what happened there, but I do know that Jason Hoffman and Joyent burnt their bridge with me and I'll never trust anything they do.<p>If there's a class action lawsuit I'm in.",1345158048

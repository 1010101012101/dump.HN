4500752,comment,4499689,4500641,2,0,talmand,,,"Turning up the volume to cover up the white noise is not an ideal solution and in many cases not a solution at all. A neighbor in an apartment building may not care for the extra noise coming through the wall. I feel your 360 example is supporting my thought, fan noise is an issue that different people handle differently. You accepted the additional level of white noise in the situation but it's not reasonable to assume every else will too.<p>> People still care but many either tolerate it or work around it based on the games.<p>Of which I totally agreed with. My point is that it's an issue because I expect Steam to expand beyond games. If the box is not built with this in mind then it's a potential issue. To expand into the TV audience market you'll need a box that won't make noise that people who are not accustomed to may not like.",1347296305

4500727,comment,4500448,4500448,12,0,courtewing,,,"I really dig the simplicity of the process.  I love that the entire top of the homepage not only shows exactly what you offer, but it is, essentially, your entire user-facing product.  The price point is a little high compared to normal custom t-shirt offerings, but if you're offering higher quality shirts and a better user experience, then that isn't a bad thing.<p>A couple of suggestions:<p>1. The person/model used for the primary image/ordering system looks <i>miserable</i>.  ""Look, you can get your own custom shirt, but it isn't going to make you happy"" doesn't exactly seem like the message you're trying to send here!  A smile would go a really long way.  Also, the cropping around the hair makes it look a little less professional.  I'm not a designer, and I'm sure it is difficult to get something like that perfect, but I think it is worth the effort given how prominent the photo is.<p>2. The photos of the t-shirts themselves make the t-shirts look like they're low quality (specifically, really thin). I'm not a huge fan of white shirts in general, but I definitely don't want <i>any</i> t-shirt that I can actively see through. Sure, your ""gallery"" model may be attractive, but it doesn't look very professional (nor does it speak highly of your shirts) if you can see her bra through the product.<p>3. I feel like the ""About, delivery & more"" link should really link to the ""About"" section. I was a little confused when it jumped down the page and I was just staring at some random ""suggestions"" which, in my case, were not interesting.  There's nothing wrong with the suggestions, I just don't think they should be more prominent than ""About"".<p>4. I'm on a 27"" thunderbolt display, and the marketing material in your bottom tabs is taking up less than half of the bottom of my screen when I am scrolled down as far as I can go.  That's not the worst thing in the world, but I would rather scroll down than just change the bottom 40% of my screen when I click ""tabs"".<p>5. I'd want more information about the product, the company, and possibly you before I order anything. If you're trying to sell quality, then a full page talking about how damn awesome your shirts are would go a long way to converting me to a customer. And after you sold me on the product itself, I still wouldn't feel safe ordering anything from an unestablished company with no business address, almost no information about the people behind it, and no contact means other than email/twitter.<p>All in all though, it is cool to see what you can accomplish in only four days.  Best of luck.",1347296041

4500642,comment,4497461,4499225,1,0,ten_fingers,,,"Much that you say is okay in general although nearly irrelevant to what I have written on this blog or done in my own work.  You seem to be hinting that research that is new has to struggle with professors to be converted to a product, has to be too expensive to convert to a product, can't result in a project that can be done by three guys in a garage, and can't result in a cheap product Grandma can use.  All of these hints are true for some research but not all.<p>You mentioned DSP:  Okay, there was a Presidential Science Advisors meeting with J. Tukey writing notes with both hands and R. Garwin.  Garwin saw Tukey writing what looked like Fourier math and asked if he knew anything Garwin didn't since he (Garwin) was struggling doing numerical Fourier transforms.  Sure, Tukey knew something.  Back at the office Garwin showed Cooley, and the Cooley, Tukey fast Fourier transform came alive, and that is the core of DSP.<p>Now all the 'research' required was just one or a few pages of derivations with elementary facts of trigonometry.  Still, the possibility of the FFT was widely missed.  So, all Tukey had to do was just keep his mouth shut, get with Texas Instruments or some such, work out a deal, build an FFT chip, try to keep secret how it worked, or maybe patent it, and get rich.  These days he could run a SaaS site that ran applications software that heavily exploits the FFT.  E.g., run software for seismic signal processing based on the FFT.  If Tukey was the only guy in the world who knew the math behind the FFT, then he could have a license to print money.<p>Seismic signal processing?  Sure, for the oil industry.  Look up ""The Abcs of Seismic Exploration and Processing Enders A. Robinson"" and other publications of Robinson.  One of his books has a nice collection of FFT and related software in an appendix.  At one time I was an expert in the FFT, and that expertise got me a new, high end Camaro.  Keeping his research on the FFT a secret could have made Tukey a fortune.<p>Well, Tukey is not the only person who can do such research!  And some of us who can do such research, e.g., with just paper and a pencil and then a cheap computer, also with TeX, now can decline to publish and, instead, just build the research results into software run on a server farm.<p>E.g., once a guy built an FFT box, all hardware.  He explained it to me complete with the logic for the different, tricky signal flow graphs between the stages.  So each different graph needed different hardware.  So, I mentioned to him that there was another version of the FFT that used the same signal flow graph at each stage, and, of course, right away he noticed that he could have saved a lot of hardware!<p>Of course, as I outlined, we don't just do the research as a shot in the dark.  Instead, as I outlined, first do Step 1, that is, pick an important, unsolved problem.  In Tukey's case it would have been running a SaaS shop for seismic signal processing.  Then in Step 2, try to do some research to get a powerful solution to the important problem.  In Tukey's case, that's where he would have done his research for the FFT.  You are following me, right?<p>So, we don't do the research until we have a problem in mind.  There's a recipe for rabbit stew that starts, ""First catch a rabbit"".  Well my recipe for applied research is, ""First get an application"" or, if you will, a problem.    THEN try to do the research.  If the research fails, then pick another problem.  However, if the research is successful, then right away you have at least on valuable application, and that fact puts your research near the top of the pile of what is relevant for making money soon.<p>That's what I've done for my project and what I recommended as a solution for the project evaluation struggles in PG's essay.<p>So, in your terminology, in my recommendation, the incentives and goals very much ARE aligned.<p>There's no law that says that I, or anyone who can do research, can't put my feet up, think of an important problem, review tools that might be useful for finding a solution, think of a solution, as original work, 'research', and proceed.  The research need be no more than Stan Ulam's ""few scribbles on a piece of paper"" that change the world.  That's all there was to Tukey's FFT, and that's all there is to my research for my project.  But lots of people struggled with Fourier transforms and didn't see what Tukey did.  And lots of people are struggling with the important problem of my project with essentially no chance of reinventing the research I did.  And my research stands to be much more powerful than anything those other guys will stir up -- for just why, an explanation here would just get people to willingly misunderstand in order to argue and the HN mods would down vote me with glee.<p>You seem to be missing what I said about DoD research and, instead, are running off in various other directions critical of the DoD.  Your criticisms may be correct, but they are basically irrelevant to what I said:  My Step 2 asks for some research to find a powerful solution to the important, unsolved practical problem of my Step 1.  So, a question is, can there be such research?  My answer is, sure:  The US DoD has been providing excellent examples for over 70 years now.  This answer is rock solidly correct and answers the question.  That the DoD wasts money in various other ways is irrelevant to my simple point here.<p>The core problem PG is seeing in project evaluation is that the projects he is considering are neglecting both my Step 1, select an important, unsolved problem, and Step 2, do some research to get a powerful solution to the problem.<p>The big advantage of picking an ""important, unsolved problem"" as in my Step 1 is that, like my example of a one pill cure for any cancer, we are absolutely certain that there will be good 'product/market fit', that is, that customers will line up.  So, the first problem with the projects PG is seeing is that the problems being solved are not both unsolved and important enough.  So, it's not clear if some such project will be another InstaGram or PInterest or just forgotten.  As explained by PG and on this thread, for such projects, some catch on and some don't, and early on it's a shot in the dark to know.  That a good, one pill cure for cancer would ""catch on"" is beyond doubt.  Then some of the struggles PG explained in project evaluation would go away.  See the importance of picking an ""important, unsolved problem""?<p>The big advantage of doing some research, as in my Step 2, for a powerful solution to the problem of Step 1 is that do get a solution to the unsolved problem, or maybe just a much better solution than anything else, and get a technological barrier to entry.  Now we come to the common remark that ""Anything you can do 1000 other people can do, are doing, or have already done"", etc., NO!  If Tukey had just stayed quiet, then it would have been a long time until\nothers had figured out what the heck he had done.  Sure, the main ideas of the FFT had been in the literature, in one form or another, going way back; still what Tukey did was nice, high quality research.  All he had to do was just be quiet.  Of course, Tukey was a big shot at Bell Labs and Princeton and in government science so was the kind of guy who would rush to publish.  But by not publishing, think what he could have done for the Princeton endowment!<p>So, net, instead of struggling trying to evaluate the projects that PG sees, pick an important, unsolved problem and then do some research to get a powerful solution.  For the DoD, it shows that such research is possible.<p>What is research?  Not easy to give a good answer quickly.  A good answer, and easy here, is just to get a technical Ph.D. from a good research university.  Without a good understanding of what research is, mostly people, hearing 'research', will get all confused with rivers of misunderstandings, fears, jealousies, resentments, etc.<p>How to apply research to solve a practical problem?  Again, a good answer is not easy to give quickly.  To get a good understanding, get a job in a lab, maybe a DoD lab, that does such work.  Again, bridging from research to a product, in some cases, is easy enough.  But unless people really understand such bridging, say, from having seen it and done it, typically, again, they will get all confused and draw lots of wrong conclusions.<p>Look, it's clear:  It's quite clear that quite likely 2+ billion Internet users will like to use my Web site based crucially on my research.  But it is also clear that even here on HN and even on Sand Hill Road or Winter Street, any mention of such research is heresy, really offensive, really pisses people off.<p>The flip side of this situation is that (1) there are very few people, even among college profs, who have the prerequisites I used in my research, (2) only a tiny fraction of those people have any interest in entrepreneurship, (3) even if some qualified person did reinvent my research, they would face the same head in the sand attitudes about research I've seen on Sand Hill Road, (4) so that, net, I stand to have essentially mo competition.<p>So, I should just quite getting attacked on HN for trying to help PG, YC, HN, and SV, mail a letter I should send today, and return today to writing the last dozen or so of my Web pages as I planned.  Off to it.<p>If anyone wants anymore about research, by all means get a good undergraduate major in pure math and then apply to graduate school in a technical field in a good research university.  I've already been there, done that and never wanted to be a teacher and certainly don't want to now.<p>Today is the last day for me on HN.<p>Stay ignorant my friends, and arrogant, too!",1347295003

Every time I revisit it, I re-order it, starting from the ideas I'm most excited about.<p>Having looked at it today, I've not completed any of my top 5 ideas. The 5 ideas I have executed on were further down the list but were only started because I had the skills needed to see them through to completion.<p>For example, for some projects I'd need to work with an iOS developer and UI/UX designers initially to share wireframes, learn limitations and get feedback & improve in an area outside of my current skills.<p>Ideally it would be a collaborative effort with a target or deliverable produced at the end of each paired-building day.<p>I've used Elance and ODesk quite a bit and they seem to fall short. They work well when you can deliver very specific instructions and have relevant area knowledge, but what about creative discussion? Improving upon an idea needs to come before the execution! It seems counter intuitive to direct a project in an area you have little knowledge of. I know from both sides how frustrating it can be.<p>As developers or designers, would you offer your services (on a daily rate) to work with people that wanted more than just a freelancer to do it for them?

Your example is basically what I'm saying, I don't think many people would care for that very much. When it comes to electronics connected to the TV the most common experience is that they produce no noise.<p>Most HTPCs are built to perform their duty with little to no fan noise but putting in a proper discrete video card can ruin that. You can get accustomed to it over time but you have to get over that initial unfamiliar white noise coming from the general direction of your TV.<p>The reason I feel that this is important is that if Steam were to start being used on a typical TV environment it will expand beyond games.

Keeping truths to oneself may be valuable, but if you have a powerful truth, the leverage you obtain by sharing with the world is a lot more powerful.<p>Nevertheless, you do have a point - how do you create value for people through a maxim that they haven't experienced? I would argue that the credibility of whom the maxim originates from is very important.<p>For example, The Bible has tremendous credibility and respect from its believers (and many non-believers too); this significant ethos prepares people to be receptive towards the maxim.

It is a fantastic platform, elegant and powerful that leverages their hardware.<p>If Apple could have gotten that same quality of software with web apps, why wouldn't they have chosen that as the platform and immediately have had millions of web devs ready to build for their mobile OS?<p>What the HTML5 evangelists fail to admit, is that HTML5+JS+CSS is a damn mess.

And the reason why it's such a great platform for that kind of thing is that the interface goes to such great lengths to discourage drawn-out discussion.  By making it hard for argumentative people to dominate the topic, it makes it possible to get a feel for what everyone's really thinking in a way that, to my knowledge, is unprecedented.<p>It's true that there is one little detail, the green checkbox, that isn't a good match for this use case.  At least not if you think of it as a way to pick the one Objectively True[tm] answer.  But to think of it that way is absurd.  Even with concrete programming issues there's often more than one way to do it, and everyone knows that in those cases and many others the green checkbox really just indicates which option the question asker liked best.<p>And beyond that, it's just plain wrongheaded to suggest that there shouldn't be room for opinion at a place like SE.  It's tantamount to saying that there's no room for discussing the difficult, nebulous problems that real professionals have to deal with on a daily basis, and that the site's really only intended for helping people with the one case in which we can always expect a single objective answer:  Homework help.",1347293339

4689669,comment,4688863,4689101,2,0,DanBC,,,"To make a PCB you design artwork, usually from the circuit diagram.  This artwork is transferred onto clear sheets.  You overlay the clear sheet onto a board - a sheet of fibreglass, a sheet of copper, and a layer of UV sensitive etch-resist.  You expose it to UV, you fix it, you wash off the etch-resist that isn't fixed (thus exposing copper) and then etch the exposed copper off, leaving the traces.<p>This process involves a couple of one-off costs (design of the PCB; transfer of that design to photo artwork).  It also involves some setup costs that you get every time you need more product - setting jigs to the right size to hold the stuff.  The artwork costs a couple hundred dollars, and that does not include any of the design and engineering costs, that's just the price if you hand a bunch of electronic data to a PCB house.<p>A stencil for screen-printing solder?  That's steel, laser cut, can only be used for your PCB, and if you change the design of the PCB you might need a new stencil.  Each stencil costs a couple hundred dollars.<p>A cropping plate is steel, or sometimes fibre glass, plate that has holes drilled where you have through-hole components fitted.  An assembly-operative would have the cropping plate held in a jig, with PCBs on it, and they'd stuff the PCB. When they've fitted all the through hole components the plate is put on a machine which slides a blade under the plate and crops the leads.  The operative then takes the PCBs off the plate, and sends them off for (probably) wave soldering.  Each cropping plate is individual, and cannot be used for any other product.  You'll need as many cropping plates as you want people to build PCBs.  Each plate is going to be a couple of hundred dollars (steel) maybe a hundred dollar (fibreglass).<p>So far you haven't got any product that you can sell to the end customer!  You've just got setup costs that you hopefully amortise over the number of product you produce.<p>You're right that an electronic assembly house would tend to outsource all this stuff to other people rather than doing everything in house.",1351018203

I think doing the lamination for a retina display at this size would have restricted the manufacturing options and that capacity they'd rather put into the new iMac, Macbook Pros and retina iPad.<p>Secondly, cost.  Retina is 4 times the pixels, and presumably significantly more expensive.   A smaller display like this at the same resolution as the original iPad is going to be closer to retina than the original iPad.<p>Thirdly, it gives a nice upgrade for the future, to incentivize people to replace their device in a year or two.  When the cost of the retina technology has dropped enough they can upgrade the mini to the same resolution as the iPad retina.<p>For new products, Apple tends to choose a mix of cutting edge and safe.  The A5 is currently in volume production so it is a safe choice, where it was cutting edge last year, for instance.<p>Apple also has a food-chain.  The newest processor goes to the newest product, and the secondary products (like the iPod touch and now iPad mini) which are in more price sensitive market positions (for instance the iPhone is subsidized by carriers but the iPod touch is not) tend to get the established one-generation-behind processors that are already cheaper to make.  This way the A5 design lasts longer and the manufacturing capacity that is making it can keep making it.... while the A6 works on the lower feature size (requiring a more cutting edge fab).<p>For instance the A6 is, I believe 20 or 22 nonometeres, while the A5 was made on a 32 nanometer feature size.",1351017604

This eliminates the long prototype cycles, since we use off-the-shelf hardware. The only real prototype cycle for us is choosing components and the case (!), which we did with 3D CAD software and a machine-shop-as-a-service we found on the Internet.<p>We went this route for reliability and performance (especially, latency), and then getting those two at a reasonable cost. By only paying for the hardware we need, and configuring it to exactly what our product/service needs, we're able to meet our product and business needs while still maintaining healthy margins at a cost our customers can afford. I wouldn't change a thing.<p>We also face all of the problems you mentioned (how to deal with inventory -- our hardware has a comprehensive 3 week burn in time), how to deal with repairs/replacements in the field, etc, and how to get the capital needed to sustain startup-scale growth. They're real problems.<p>Like most hardware-based companies, we're able to do this only with outside funding, but at least in our case (the enterprise space), we don't need any up front funding to stay cash-flow positive with slow growth, and we developed a rather innovative way to get the funding that we do need to fund fast frowth (hint: not through VCs). This took a lot of effort at the business-design level, something I suspect most tech startups don't take the time to do. It's pretty much mandatory if you're going the custom hardware route and want to grow fast.<p>One major positive of going the custom hardware route is the elimination of competitors. No YC-backed company going the standard AWS route can possibly compete with us -- not on cost, not on performance, not on latency, and not on reliability -- not even close. Controlling the whole stack, from hardware to OS to software is why we can do what we do at the price we do it, and grow at the rate we expect to grow.<p>I'm not sure we could make our approach work in the consumer hardware space today, but in the enterprise market, it's ideal for us.",1351017306

Through the practice of proxy ordinances for the dead, Mormon doctrine has always made clear that all would have the chance at salvation even if denied the opportunity to have the priesthood during this life.<p>* Limiting the priesthood, or even the preaching of the gospel, to a specific family is part of the Biblical pattern in both the Old and New Testaments.<p>* Though there was clearly some racism in the Mormon Church before 1978 (and probably still is today), the people I know who were part of the church at that time say it was limited. The official position then, as it is now, was of love and acceptance within the limitations they felt the Lord had set.<p>Conversations such as this one are valuable, but be aware that they tend to oversimplify complex topics.<p>A great book on the topic written by a black Mormon who joined the Church before 1978 is this one:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Blacks-Mormon-Priesthood-Setting-Straight/dp/1932597417"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Blacks-Mormon-Priesthood-Setting-Strai...</a>",1351017084

For example, applications can't use hardware accelerated video according to their FAQ [1].<p>So pardon me while I braindump...<p>It would be an interesting project to integrate an Android-style permissions permissions system(possibly using SELinux) complete with per-application virtual filesystems (using FUSE) into the system package manager.  So, for example, you install a music player, the package manager sets up a virtual filesystem for it that lets the program see its own configuration directory and your music directory, but nothing else.  The package manager asks if you'd like to allow network permissions to the music player (for downloading album art or whatever); if yes, a firewall rule is added specifically allowing that process to access the network, if not, none is.<p>One problem with that kind of system is that a lot of end-user desktop programs are written with the assumption that the entire home directory is fair game.  I'm not convinced that's really necessary, though.  In case a program occasionally wants to access a file outside of its normal sandbox (say, you just downloaded a podcast into your downloads directory and want to play it with that music player I mentioned previously) you could always have the supervising program ask the user if it's okay to temporarily add that file to the program's sandbox.  If it happens in an expected way (e.g. the user clicks on a media file in the file manager) you could safely grant access to the file without explicitly asking the user.<p>Something like that, on a distro using Wayland as the windowing system (to avoid the gaping security holes in X), would provide 90% of the security that Qubes does with significantly less inconvenience to the user.  It would still require a good deal of work for the package maintainers, but perhaps a distro like that could implement something like the AUR [2] so users could do a lot of the packaging work for peripheral packages.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://qubes-os.org/FAQ.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qubes-os.org/FAQ.html</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https://aur.archlinux.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://aur.archlinux.org/</a>",1351017065

Mathias was right, and the iPad Mini's design is more about photo ops than daily use, and users will tend to accidentally tap when they hold it.<p>I'm really curious here, because device design is something of a mysterious art and I have enjoyed watching the different schools of design play out.<p>UPDATE, ""iPad mini intelligently recognizes whether your thumb is simply resting on the display or whether youre intentionally interacting with it. Its the kind of detail youll notice  by not noticing it.""<p>So, software. Which means that it'll be fine for reading, but probably not fine for gaming where there is a lot of input sensitivity required. That may explain why the bezels on the top ends (for holding it in portrait) are more conventionally sized.",1351016711

With the advent of SOCs, its possible to do most of the hardware side of the design at the chip level. So if you can combine SOC design with high level programming (if needed) you have everything you need to holistically design a gadget. Can one person do this? Yes, I think so. As designers, with the kind of support we are now getting from SOC design tools and software development tools, the only thing missing is your product level idea and your desire to execute it.

The real (and perhaps the only) reason Groupon is not sustainable is because the fundamental assumption that the business model rests on turned out to be false. Let me explain.<p>The original idea was that Groupon would team up with a business and provide deep discounts to consumers to encourage them to try out that business. The assumption, which Groupon's sales folks used aggressively to push sales, was that a significant portion of those consumers would like the business so much that they would become repeat customers, thereby (in the long run) offsetting the cost of the original discount. In the end, the business would turn a profit.<p>Except it didn't work that way.<p>What ended up happening instead is that the vast majority of consumers never actually went back to the business. The reason is simple: while they could justify paying X dollars for the business's product or service just to try it out, they couldn't justify paying X times three or four. Because of this, most Groupon clients (the businesses) end up losing money, and never offer a second or third discount via GroupOn.<p>This is why GroupOn has such a huge number of sales reps: they need an ever increasing number of clients in order to postpone the inevitable sinking of the ship.",1351015436

I believe the DMCA makes cracking all forms of DRM illegal except in certain cases which are outlined by the Library of Congress every three years. The last time the exceptions were updated was July 2010 [1], so they will be up for review again in 2013. If I'm interpreting the current guidelines correctly, you can only crack ebook DRM if it is preventing you from using text-to-speech (presumably for blind people or people with poor eyesight).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2010/Librarian-of-Congress-1201-Statement.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2010/Librarian-of-Congress-120...</a>",1351015255

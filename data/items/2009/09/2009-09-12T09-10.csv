I've lost 1-2 kg over the course of a weekend of being sick before, but that's just an extreme. All of ""eat less loose weight"" strategies work only if you consider amount eaten and energy expended to be independent. Which, to me, sounds incredibly unlikely considering how fine-tuned we are in every other respect.<p>When all said and done, my personal weight loss method is still eating less: but eating dramatically less then normal for relatively short periods (4-10 weeks). I'm a bit scared to think about everything my body is shutting down in this time. For starters, it takes about a week for my brain to catch up with the changed diet.",1252749585
818788,story,,,19,28,project_idea,"Ask YC: What project to work on?",,"Although there have been threads like this before, I would really appreciate if you could mention some project ideas of what you would like to see built but don't have time/interest in building it yourself. Also any personal advice is welcome, to the extent that it is possible in such an anonymous setting.<p>A bit of background: I have recently quit grad-school and I have no interest in working at big corp. and interesting startups are hard to find in my geographical location. While I was in grad school or when I worked at companies I constantly felt I had one great idea after the other for software/web projects, I even wrote down several of them, for when I will have time to work on them. Well, now I have the time, and in fact I've been mostly idle for a few months but none of the ideas I thought about earlier seem that great anymore. Either they are done already, or they don't solve a problem, or they are trivial, or they are impossible to do. Some might be doable but not interesting to me at the moment. I can post some in comments if anyone interested. It seems that being idle really hurts one's chances of stumbling upon interesting problems to work on.<p>I would like to work on a project addressing some real problem, it can be any sort of web/desktop/server programming, I don't mind working on something that seems overly ambitious or open-ended, but some small concrete problem is nice also. I prefer something with a machine learning/statistics/optimization bend, but not necessarily.<p>Sorry for the long rant, long story short: what to work on ? or how do you find projects to work on ? I deliberately ignored the business aspects, assuming that once you are solving someone's problem you can start figuring out strategies for monetizing it, etc.",1252748911

818781,comment,818781,818415,0,0,jwhite,,,"> I'm sorry but smart people don't make wild generalizations because they understand it's impossible to easily categorize almost 7 billion unique people.<p>I think you're confusing categorizing people with pronouncing value judgments on them.  Moreover, your first sentence makes a demonstrably false claim.  It is trivially easy to categorize people (e.g. male/female/transgender, people-I-like/people-I-don't-like, etc.).  The interesting question is how to categorize people in useful ways that can help you understand how society functions, and I think the article gives a really interesting analysis of one chosen categorization.<p>I agree that it isn't healthy to base one's self esteem on negative value judgments of others, just as it is always better to look at what positive contributions a person has to offer society, no matter how small.",1252747367

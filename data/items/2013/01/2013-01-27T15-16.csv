Yes, dependency on glibc and the Linux kernel is sometimes annoying, but in practice it is not an insurmountable problem. Dependency on the Linux kernel is rare and dependency on glibc can usually be easily fixed and upstream is usually happy to accept patches.

5124589,comment,5124254,5124254,32,0,thaumaturgy,,,"3. I don't understand the desire to trim seconds off of boot-up time (even assuming that systemd does this; it didn't for me). The goal should be to restart less often, not to restart more quickly.<p>5. The systemd documentation is indeed very good, and that's probably one of the biggest drivers behind its adoption. However, it is <i>also</i> difficult. A big part of the pushback from people over systemd is that it <i>also</i> replaced syslog, and did so with its own custom binary log format. To quote from a forum thread I started shortly after updating my old system to systemd, ""Getting smbd/nmbd to work again was a real adventure. Like other users reported, it would just silently fail when starting it from systemd. No error message when issuing the start command, and only a vague ""failed"" in status. I ended up having to track down Lennart's blog post on ""systemd for administrators"" to figure out how in blazes to extract anything useful from that cussed binary log system he invented. My first half-dozen or so attempts to get anything useful out of the log journal got exactly zero results; I finally got lucky on another approach..."" (I ended up abandoning that distribution altogether after that and a number of other frustrations, and the response from the forums.)<p>13. The problem for BSDs isn't so much that systemd is or isn't portable to them; it's that some upstream software is beginning to <i>require</i> systemd, making that software difficult (or impossible) to port to BSD.<p>14. It seems weird to me to hear someone else decide for other people what is or isn't a ""negligible"" amount of work.<p>15. So ... systemd is in fact Linux-only by design. How does that jive with 13 again?<p>19. systemd may not ""force"" you to do anything, up until your distribution adopts it, pushes it as an update, and then you find yourself spending hours trying to figure out how to troubleshoot a problem that didn't exist before the update. Then it certainly <i>is</i> forcing you to do something.<p>Here's the problem in a nut shell as I see it: if systemd had been the default in Linux for the last ten years, probably the tool chain around it would be mature enough to meet everyone's needs, we would all be accustomed to the specific commands needed to control and interact with and debug systemd stuff, and if someone came along and proposed replacing everything with a syslog daemon and a pile of init scripts, there'd be rage and outcry. That is to say, I don't see anything <i>inherently</i> bad about systemd.<p>But, what <i>is</i> enormously frustrating is to have something that works, and be well adapted to it, so that if something breaks I know exactly where to look, and then have all of that be replaced by a foreign system that breaks old things in new ways and requires hours spent trying to figure out what the hell happened.<p>If the replacement system offers serious benefits over the old system, that offsets the pain slightly. In this case, I've yet to see what the actual benefits are; I have no idea what problems systemd is attempting to solve which are so severe, so immediate, so intractable that they require a jarring change to some of the fundamental parts of the operating system.",1359302274

5124585,comment,5122932,5123458,1,0,rdl,,,"1) You realize the Elcomsoft attacks were largely mitigated for iPad 2, iPhone 4S and later, right?  If I were drchrono, I'd either require those devices (or later), or at least require informed consent by the administrator of an office to allow earlier devices.<p>I'd bet on iOS vs. stock Android for security-critical bugs at this point, but it's kind of a wash.  You could maybe audit Android better, but that would be a serious engineering effort.<p>2) drchrono makes EHR.  They don't make a secure tablet OS, and they don't (as far as I know) distribute tablets/phones to the doctors.  Being a software/services business vs. a full consultancy is a big difference.  Being a HW/OS developer is a big jump beyond even consultancy.<p>I'd love it if someone decided to build a SE Android + HW security Android distribution (maybe with device virtualization like from Bromium built in, too).  And centralized management per-organization (i.e. not by Google or Apple or a carrier, but yourself).  Essentially a Blackberry that didn't suck.  Unfortunately, no one is doing that, and it would essentially require being Samsung or HTC to build the hardware, and someone like Google to build the software.  Google's Android team has repeatedly shown themselves to be at best indifferent and more likely hostile to any real enterprise security features; they barely have a sandbox (in contrast to Chrome and the SSL teams at Google, and corp security, who are pretty much world-class for security).<p>I'm pretty sure if someone were building that, it wouldn't be drchrono, though.<p>3) No one cares about $500 vs. $300 for a tablet once they've made the decision to buy for a doctor's office, at least from my experience with doctors.  Pretty much anything <$1k is the same.  This is admittedly mainly in the US, but that's where most healthcare spending happens, and where the ""meaningful use"" incentive happens ($50k to adopt an EHR/EMR).<p>iPad 2 would be a legitimate deployment platform, and those are cheap (you'd really want a 10"" in a medical environment), if you really care about cheap.

Saying that Javascript is Lisp-like just because it's somewhat functional is like saying that it's like Java because it's ""object-oriented"", even though there are a number of key differences (the use of ""this"", the prototypical inheritance model, runtime checks vs. static checks with late binding, etc.) It's worse, because it's rather trivial to force Javascript to behave somewhat like Java, but there's no way to force Javascript to exemplify the defining characteristics of a Lisp[0].<p>The nature of Lisp has <i>nothing</i> to do with lambdas and closures, mapcars and reduces - the phrase 'Lisp in C's clothing' doesn't even make sense, because the nature of Lisp cannot exist without an s-expression-based grammar[1]. Even though Lisp is known as a functional language, the defining characteristics of Lisp have nothing to do with it being functional.<p>[0] Perhaps a better analogy would be comparing it to JVM languages on the basis of the grammar, even though the two are completely orthogonal - Javascript isn't intended to run on the JVM, and while you can cross-translate code between Javascript and JVM languages and fake compatibility this way, that ability has very little do do with the defining characteristics of Javascript as a language.<p>[1] That doesn't mean you need to have parentheses; the grammar simply needs to be homomorphic with s-expressions, which leaves a great deal of flexibility. Javascript, however, does not make the cut.",1359302127

As long as you produce publishable results, you may do virtually whatever you want, and nowadays pretty much anything is publishable.

It's not Roark versus Toohey. Copyleft was conceived out of Stallman's personal desire to access source code for his own ends. Likewise one can reasonably believe as a practical that the benefits of widespread use of a piece of code outweigh those from its source code availability. The two positions approach utilitarianism from different philosophical positions. One places more emphasis on actions the other on rules.<p>Perhaps most of us might agree that the ideal would be widespread adoption, open source, and equitable compensation of the author. Fewer would agree that this ideal is the norm in our shared world. Copyleft carries a lot of overhead. Could effort spent on license compliance be better spent elsewhere?<p>Copyleft solves a set of problems. That set of problems were pressing in the computing community of thirty years ago - at least once one got away from Vic-20's and Apple II's.

In the last ten years, or so, I figured that all the companies or organisations that I wanted to work for didn't actually exist, and if they did they wouldn't hire me to run them. So I started my own instead. But several of them have taken outside investment, which means I am doing ""job interviews"" all the time, but with investors. It feels like investors are pickier than employers.

Nintendo entered the scene with a restrictive game approval process - remember the Nintendo Seal of Quality? - reducing the number of games while increasing their quality.  In effect, he argues a ""slightly open"" marketplace rebuilt consumer confidence and raised the Nintendo platform's value.<p>If you look at the App Store today, there is a closed loop between the iPhone consumer marketplace, app developers, and the App Store platform.  Apple's permeable nozzle on app submission increases the value of the platform while leaving most of a free market in place.  This draws consumers, increasing the value to app developers.<p>In short, a slightly-restricted platform can be good for everyone.<p>I wish I could find the specific article.

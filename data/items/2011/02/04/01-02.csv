2177919,comment,2175588,2177696,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""Do they do anything similar to correct for lying""<p>There is an entire literature on the validity of self-reported drug use that they take into account. For example, there is a phenomenon called recanting, where someone will admit to using a drug one year and then deny it in future years. They correct for this by ignoring when someone recants if they have already admitted to using the drug on at least two previous surveys. (Which would be administered at least two years apart.)<p>What they found was that the people most likely to recant were the ones who got jobs where they would now be fired for admitting drug use. For example, cops recanted drug use after previously admitting to it at twice the rate of the general public. So that's how they made the decision to discount recanting for people who had already admitted to drug use twice or more times.<p>As for people who try to lie and claim they are taking drugs that they haven't been, this is corrected for by asking about the same drug multiple times in different ways. I think they may also salt the questions by asking about drugs that don't exist.<p>You can obviously read all about the methodology of Monitoring the Future by downloading it, and here is an enormous PDF with tons of studies on the validity of self-reported drug use in general:<p><a href=""http://archives.drugabuse.gov/pdf/monographs/monograph167/download167.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archives.drugabuse.gov/pdf/monographs/monograph167/do...</a><p>All in all the methods they are using seem fairly accurate. It would definitely be a little higher if they corrected for more stuff, so for example when they say that 82% of Americans have used marijuana, it's actually probably closer to 85 or 86% when you correct for additional things that they haven't.",1296783174

Given that Google is extremely popular, this must have given a lot of weight to clickstream signals resulting from Google SERPs on many occasions, for common queries. That is entirely unethical and I'm shocked so many here don't find a problem with this.<p>Take the case of a highly-ranked great result on Google for a particular term, which Bing rates lower due to inferior algorithms. Bing's analysis of Google users would send that result higher in the Bing SERPs, mainly due to Google's expertise in highlighting that site, and only to a small degree due to the user's choice of clicking on it. That to be does fall under ""copying"" Google's results, it may not be illegal, or intentional, but copying it remains.<p>Bing should have excluded Google from their clickstreams, and I certainly hope Google exclude Bing from their's.

A little background information:<p>Last semester before my stint as an intern at Videoplaza (hey guys!:D), I took up a course known as Software Engineering. Microsoft kinda sponsored the course. It was a 8 modular credit course, that meant an equivalent of 2 normal courses. That made this a huge course. The course scope was well, basically, for teams to put software engineering skills into practise. Iterative programmiing, revision control, software architectural design. You get the gist. The course requirement was for teams to engage software engineering skills to develop a file syncing tool, with C#.<p>Well, as a full time Archlinux user, I hated that I had to code a full app for a platform I don't even use. I was the leader of my team, and with a little bit of persuasion, I managed to convince my team to go with Mono, and to develop the app to work cross-platform. While everyone was working with WPF, .NET, blabla. My team did some crazy stuff like using SVN to sync files (instead of writing our own backend for syncing), GTK for GUI, iKVM to use SVNKit in Mono, blabla. It was a hell of a course, but we managed to pull through, and our plan to re-use open-sourced components meant we could focus on features, and learning new frameworks. Also, how cool would it be to go rogue on a Microsoft sponsored course?<p>My team won 2nd place when M$ came down to reviewed the apps after they were done. However, the team was awarded B+ as a grade, and myself, as a A+ only because my peers graded me highly on a peer review appraisal. It bothered me. The code wasn't that bad (review it at http://code.google.com/p/subsynct/), we met with some serious obstacles and overcome it anyways, and within a tight timeframe. I was proud of the result, and of my team's effort.<p>It made no sense to me how my team only deserved a B+.<p>And so after months of back-headed nagging, I shot an email to my professor for some clarifications: http://pastebin.com/APXEcFG4<p>Here is his reply: http://pastebin.com/paMntaY2<p>And heres my final reply: http://pastebin.com/DHSt1dkg<p>---<p>Just an example of how innovation is discouraged and frowned upon in an Asian context. One of the main reasons why technology entrepreneurial activities is in such a poor state in Singapore.<p>PS: Don't use the app, it was a proof-of-concept. SVN really suck balls in performance for binary files. We learnt this the hard way.",1296782332

If you meant giving away a <i>copy</i> of your collection then that's a little different but that's not what's happening with user generated click streams.

Once the trend is set, Bing captures the trend by monitoring user's behavior and provides that to the other users. By reflecting user's behavior in its own index, Bing seems to replicate the Google's index structure which created that behavior. Had there been no Google, there would have been different trends and Bing would capture those instead.<p>It's not Bing's fault that Google is so influential, and certainly not a reason for them to stop dedcuing relevance frm user behavior. Just because Google creates trends, does not mean they own trends. The users own their own behavior and are free to share it.",1296781620

But it is an ordered list (at least to the user -- it may not be ordered all the way down or partially so).<p>Fair enough point about suggest and instant.  In those cases Google is adding value to the query, but I think we'd both agree that it is incrementally so.  Instant generally just helps you get to the eventual query faster.  Spell checking does add value, but its a +epsilon.  In either case, your right, we should add this to our function.<p>In any case I think my point still holds.  The query is the most important aspect.  The browsed page, for indexing purposes is the second most important aspect.  The association between the query and the URL is the least important aspect.<p>IOW, the least value for Bing is the search algorithm.

Not even that, this is about a sorting of identifiers against arbitrary strings of text.  Whatever distinctions we have here are gonna appear incredibly small (and petty), but it's really the bread and butter of search.<p>Both are map makers in a sense, providing guides to what they didn't create, but still spent plenty of effort to make that guide.  In the literal, map-making world, the artifact is the printed map.  In that world, the way to check for copyright infringement is to see if mapping errors are duplicated as well.<p>The presumption being that if the errors were copied, then so was the good data.<p>Short-term, the benefit was that users would get discounts on high-quality data, as they only had to pay for the efforts of the map-copy, not the original map data acquisition.  Of course, then you're just waiting for the quality to drop, as there's less and less incentive to actually do the map-making work.  The margins go down, and the original sources have to update their maps less often to keep their costs low enough to be competitive.<p>There isn't a printed page with web search; the product is the output of a continuously-running dataset & algorithm.<p>But, I'm gonna ask, in the web-search world, how do you define copying and how do you test for it?  If you don't think there is a valid definition, please don't count yourself the same as the group who thinks that there is a valid definition and this isn't it.  They're two separate things.<p>(I've framed the question how I see it, and I work for Google, but I'm obviously no official speaker -- I've only been here a few months, and don't work in search quality.

Apple have failed here completely, providing a woeful level of security for a service where the potential cost (loss of all user data) for the end-user is very high.<p>Amazon on the other hand doesn't (potentially) have the power to wipe your machines and cause havoc. If someone compromises your Amazon account, then worst case they can order goods in your name to be sent to you & Amazon will be out the cost of shipping and re-selling those goods, plus the cost of any chargebacks if they mess you about refunding your credit card. In other words, the risk here lies with Amazon, not the end-user, so they are rightly free to set the level of security applied to Amazon accounts to whatever they feel meets their goals.<p>It's not Amazon's fault that the 4 digits that the credit card companies decided that it was ok to leave on your receipts are precisely the four digits that Apple accepts as evidence that you own the card in question.
The fault lies with Apple for accepting data that you leave behind every time you make a purchase with your credit card (it's printed on every credit card receipt you leave behind at the local pizza joint IIRC) as being suitable evidence to permit an anonymous caller access to an Apple account.<p>Now, if Amazon applies the same level of security to accounts with personal data or other costs to the end-user (cloud drive, Amazon S3 or EC2 accounts and so on) then you'd be right to lay into them.

Unfortunately, highly integrated systems like the iMac have traditionally made it difficult to replace or upgrade parts. And forget about assembling an all-in-one for yourself. Now, however, Intel has developed a Thin Mini-ITX platform that allows system builders and end users to put together all-in-one systems with standard parts. Our hands-on look at Thin Mini-ITX pieces together an ersatz iMac using off-the-shelf components, and the process is pretty easy. While the end result isn't quite as slick as one of Apple's creations, parts can be swapped out with ease, and the configuration can be tailored to suit one's needs.",1344358298

An official Street Fighter 4 cabinet costs around $10,000.  However, because the most recent home console version of SF4 is identical to the arcade version, it's possible to simply buy an Xbox 360, a display, and a pair of fightsticks (input devices with parts identical to what you would find in an arcade cabinet) and build a wooden shell to house them.  Total cost?  Less than $1000 for parts, plus labor for assembly.  Most people can't tell the difference, and even those who can tell the difference won't care, because the software and input hardware are identical.  This makes it far more economical for establishments to offer these options--at $1000, you might not even worry about turning a profit from usage fees, and could offer the game mainly as a service to patrons.<p>The other benefit of the homebrew cabinet is that it allows you to run any console game you please.  Marvel vs Cacpom 3, one of the two most popular fighting games in North America, is actually home console only--there's no official cabinet, so homebrew is the only way to go if you want an arcade setup.",1344357380

 You must go by a way which is the way of ignorance.""<p>I came to CS and programming only after a degree in the humanities so every time I learned something new I felt incredibly stupid. I would read books very slowly and carefully, re-reading any tricky parts, and never assuming my prior knowledge in an area was at all relevant to what I was learning.  But after every book I read, or topic I learned my mind and understanding of the world really felt expanded.<p>After a while I started to gain confidence, and the perhaps a bit more than confidence. I remember being proud the first time I opened a technical book and thought ""pssh I know most of this already this will be a quick read"".  But I quickly discovered that whenever I approached a topic this way I only left with a shallow change in my understanding. In fact I realized that I was shaping this new material to what I already new rather than expanding my existing assumptions.  I was essentially wasting my time, reinforcing my ego but not really learning much.<p>So whenever I meet someone who is learning something new and they're angry with themselves for how 'stupid' they are, I remind them that this is actually the peak of learning.  And likewise whenever I open a book, even if it's in familiar territory I try to put myself in that mind set of ignorance.  It's a pity we, especially in technical fields, associate so much shame with ignorance, when this is a feeling that we should aim for when we sit down to learn.<p>For anyone familiar with Zen Buddhism you'll probably recognize this idea as a variant on Shoshin or ""beginner's mind""",1344357237

There will always be someone willing to throw more money at a great employee.  Basing any retention policy on salary (beyond making sure the salary is ""enough"") is doomed to fail.<p>For startups, equity is a big motivator, because the employee has some level of control over how the company does.  This allows the employee to dream of the perfect beach house somewhere, that if they work hard enough, they will be able to get.  Even selling that dream isn't enough to keep the best talent.  There needs to be a good team in place, and tasks need to be delegated in a way that employees are constantly challenged and rewarded by being able to build awesome things.  If those aren't in place, no amount of equity or salary is going to make things better.",1344356028
4350756,comment,4349519,4349519,0,0,wahsd,,,"Whether or not Samsung is going through some sort of ""crisis of design"", the pernicious nature of what Apple is doing is quite underestimated. They are trying to claim minimalism, the lack of distinction, as their own. It is the minimalism and efficiency dilemma.<p>Fact of the matter is that current state of technology places limits and barriers that should not be permitted for patent or copyright right up against. In fact, this effect will only concentrate even more as the physical nature of technology and innovation disappears as things get smaller and more concentrated.<p>With technology and design starting to crowd up against a barrier of physical form-factors, it becomes increasingly apparent that patenting and copyrighting should proportionally protect the change, the innovation, the added value; not the absolute.<p>The iPad and iPhone are not, in any significant way, unique. They are more marginal variations on existing technology and design than not. Capturing popular attention and leveraging inherent human desires is what garnered the devices and Apple so much fame and fortune, not the innovation or creativity. There is nothing unique about straight lines, exact curvature, shininess, sharp edges, and uniformity. Apple simply OCDed the shit out of their products. I applaud their designs and their configuration of technology, but much of it is not sufficiently unique to warrant patenting or copyrighting.<p>Where do you draw the line, and will Apple (or any other corporations for that matter) be allowed to draw that line right around their interests, products, and designs in a self-serving manner...essentially corporate gerrymandering?<p>Tongue-in-cheek, so no need to tell me how stupid I am, but we may as well allow for the patent on anything that is different than what existed prior if we are going to allow patenting and copyrighting of what is defined by hardly more than the technological limitations. Should one be allowed to patent a tablet that is 5 mm thick because it is thinner than a 6 mm tablet?<p>When you patent fundamental constraints, you might as well patent and copyright going from point A to point B and sue everyone that doesn't go through point C to get to point B. You are essentially trying to force complexity and inefficiency because you have hijacked simplicity and efficiency.",1344355999

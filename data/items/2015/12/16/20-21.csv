Currently it takes the form of heatmaps which only tell you what people are familiar with and not what is actually useful. A UI should not be measured by whether it can be learned easily. Good interfaces improve efficiency when used by people who are sufficiently knowledgeable in how to use them. Using a mouse is quicker than typing alone.[2] The perception that mice are slower is because you often see less adept people using them in a hunt-and-click manner.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/misc/nipple.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/misc/nipple.html</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://plan9.bell-labs.com/wiki/plan9/Mouse_vs._Keyboard/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plan9.bell-labs.com/wiki/plan9/Mouse_vs._Keyboard/ind...</a>",1450299551

However once you have disparate types(which is very common) that falls apart. What happens if you have a string associated with an object that you don&#x27;t want to cache miss on? I haven&#x27;t seen a language that deals with that appropriately other than C/C++.<p>Value types are nice in Java, when will we see them in production? We don&#x27;t even have Java8 on Android yet so I probably won&#x27;t be able to use them till ~4-5 years from now.<p>Byte arrays may be less work but they still have problems, you&#x27;ll pay the int->float cast costs for one, which can be non-trivial on some platforms. Also if you want to use Strings you end up allocating a new string on each access since Java doesn&#x27;t have a nice way to wrap an immutable string(take a look at FlatBuffers if you want to see this in more detail).<p>I think it&#x27;s important to understand they we&#x27;re talking about a specific set of areas that C++ excels in.

IIRC, generally, a higher interest rate environment will incentivize people to go from renting to home ownership as rents increase due to increase lending costs & lowered/flatter housing costs.<p>Each 1% hike in interest reduces the leveraged buying power of all buyers about ~$21k per $1000 mortgage payment.<p>$1000 @ 4% = 209k loan (30 yr)\n$1000 @ 5% = 188k loan (30 yr)\n$1000 @ 6% = 167k loan (30 yr)<p>The maximum monthly payments for a mortgage are capped at 36-44% Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio.  At the 36% DTI, a hypothetical Joe with no debt making 10k/mo, will be approved for about $2000/mo mortgage.  Today&#x27;s market at 4% means Joe can get a $418k loan.  By 2018, with interest rates moved up 2%, he would only be able to get a $334k loan with that same $2k.<p>Banks make money on the rate arbitrage.  Currently, they get money at .25% and loan it out at around 4%.  I&#x27;m guessing they will be borrowing from the fed at 2% and loaning it out for around 5.75-6% if we stick to the 2% rate by 2018.  But I think long-term mortgages are tied to treasury bonds.<p>If it causes enough people to affect the lending volume, the mortgage lenders may be willing to take a small hit to their margins and try to make up for it in volume.<p>I guess we will see.

When you buy a bond, you are giving the government your money now in order to receive a return on that money later, with the expectation that the government will do something useful with the money in the meantime. So if the government is allocating its budget well, then yes, purchasing bonds is a good thing. If it is not, you are making a bad loan to someone who may not be able to pay you back in the future.<p>Government stimulates demand by investing in sectors that have huge up-front costs but large positive social externalities over time because the lifespan of a gov is much greater than that of an individual or corporation. It invests in infrastructure - the national grid, highways, roads, prisons, the post office, mortgage lending, insurance - most importantly though, wars, education, and healthcare. Many of these industries have become increasingly privatized over the past 30 years. This is not inherently bad, but it changes the profit time horizon and shifts incentives away from long-term investment towards short-term profit maximization.<p>iPhone would not exist without the development of the internet during the cold war on gov grants, the affordability and draw of public UC Berkley where Jobs and Wozniaki met, people alive and well-fed enough to buy it, etc. You can&#x27;t point to a single innovation without looking at the entire fabric of the society that produced it. Gov spending has huge impact on social fabric. iPhone is also only one half of equation. If no one has the disposable income to buy one, it doesn&#x27;t matter how good it is.",1450298433

Sometimes in galleries the artist will write a blurb about their ideas and motivations or general background, and most designers work under circumstances where they have to justify their design choices to someone else, and if not, the critic might ask the artist/designer what they intended or suppose an intention. In both cases the intentions may as well be irrelevant if the work produces the desired effect.<p>The point that the parent post is making is that letting the intentions be knows is purely for the benefit of those interested in judging a work on other merits than those conveyed by the work itself. In design, that is usually totally beside the point. The purpose of a visual design is to convey some sort of information, and that information usually isn&#x27;t the intention itself (a classic counter-example is that of a button that says &quot;Click here!&quot;). As a designer I might produce a cluttered, ugly looking chart to convey the idea that the underlying data is really complex. As a work to be judged, that might be interesting to know, but as a design it might as well have fulfilled its purpose perfectly without ever explicitly mentioning it.",1450298255

Standards are typically set by committees comprised of multiple parties, and all entities have an agenda. Sometimes its self-interest, sometimes it&#x27;s just something like &quot;all things being equal, we prefer doing things this way&quot;, but it undoubtedly influences the outcome.<p>Certainly; however, making any such change needs to come with arguments that convince others and drive towards consensus, rather than political machinations to manufacture consensus.<p>When someone proposes a change software project, they doubtless have some reason for proposing that change.  However, projects don&#x27;t typically pay attention to reasons like &quot;we need this change to support our product&quot;, or &quot;this makes our internal processes easier&quot;, or &quot;without this change our business model collapses&quot;.  And they certainly don&#x27;t accept arguments like &quot;if you ignore what&#x27;s wrong with this patch, I&#x27;ll [insert reciprocation here]&quot;.  A change has to come with arguments for why it&#x27;s the right thing for the project, not just why it&#x27;s the right thing for the person proposing the patch.<p>> 2. Regarding OOXML, maybe the actual problem could be stated as, &quot;the vast majority of the world&#x27;s official documentation is in a proprietary format and we want to make it open in a way that doesn&#x27;t inconvenience the millions of users of the existing files, because otherwise nobody would use the new format.&quot; Regardless of whether there were dirty politics, what would the best solution to that look like?<p>Treat the old binary document format and representation as the legacy format it was, without giving it a veneer of &quot;standardization&quot;.  Add features and capabilities to the existing ODF standard, rather than creating a new competing one; likewise, in the various sub-formats, pay attention to existing standards rather than inventing new ones.  Migrate to that format as the native format, not just as an export mechanism.  Discourage people from saving in the old binary formats.  Provide the rendering engine and parsing code of the old office suite as an Open Source library to handle legacy documents.  Provide migration tools that actually cross-check things like pagination with the legacy document renderer, to confirm the fidelity of the conversion; collaboratively improve those tools until they achieve maximum fidelity on all available documents.  Then, people can migrate new or edited documents with reasonable fidelity, get perfect fidelity for historical documents, and interchange documents with no compatibility issues.<p>That would not necessarily serve the goals of any one office suite vendor, but it would help move the world&#x27;s documents to an open, standard, interchangeable format.",1450297873

Whether I think &quot;Lil Miss Hot Mess&quot; is a ridiculous name or not doesn&#x27;t alter the reality that facebook daily &quot;disappears&quot; people&#x27;s accounts whose names aren&#x27;t up to their standards. This change in policy gives people a week to protest that disappearance, but it doesn&#x27;t change facebook&#x27;s level of control.

So, given that names are arbitrary (even when enforcing a &quot;real names&quot; policy, there are people who have ridiculous names), and given that enforcing a real names policy harms countless people, and given that not enforcing real names has very little negative result except to facebook&#x27;s bottom line (and even that is negligible), I just don&#x27;t see it as defensible.<p>The argument that it prevents abuse and bullying is shown to be a lie by the fact that this policy has been used, since facebook&#x27;s inception, to bully people, and facebook has for all that time remained complicit, and even an active participant, in that bullying. You can&#x27;t claim to want to prevent bullying if you&#x27;re the one holding the victim down while someone else punches them.",1450297357

An example would be a confusing construction area, or navigating with rocks on the road after a landslide. In these areas where road lines and signs aren&#x27;t as applicable, the car needs a human driver. The human driver is so people aren&#x27;t abandoning cars at the start of construction zones, not so they can step in to avoid a sudden collision.

You can apply iterator adaptors to such iterators as the receiving end of a channel ( <a href=""http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Receiver.html#method.iter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Receiver.html#...</a> ), and you can pass around the iterator and add other computations to the end of it before you &quot;run&quot; the whole thing.<p>However, I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by the transformation processes being <i>functions</i>. In Rust these processes (iterators) are values, and have methods that produce a derived process by appending a step; for a concrete example:<p><pre><code>    let fb_chars = &quot;foobar&quot;.chars(); //fb_chars is an iterator\n    let not_o = fb_chars.filter(|&x| x!=&#x27;o&#x27;); //not_o is an iterator; we got it by applying the filter iterator adaptor\n    for i in not_o {println!(&quot;char: {}&quot;, i);} //run the iterator with a for loop; we could also have run it by calling .collect() and obtaining a collection\n</code></pre>\nWhat are the domain and range of the functions you mention in Clojure?",1450296190

2355852,comment,2355448,2355448,0,0,callahad,,,"Wow. It sounds like the author perceived folks talking about topics outside of his own expertise to be ""showing off their knowledge,"" or ""using a bunch of technical jargon to make others feel dumb."" That view was probably reinforced by his questions being met with hostile and elitist responses. Arrogance and condescension are issues that I've seen repeatedly in our community, but ascribing malice to individuals visibly enjoying their work? That sits solely on the author's shoulders.<p>So why the disdain? From the comparisons to mathematicians and accountants, it sounds like the author views programming solely as an occupation, and doesn't see the possibility for it to be a creative avocation. Thus, continued discussion of the topic outside of the workplace must be an attempt to assert superiority over the others in the room.<p>But what if you instead make comparisons to other overtly creative pursuits? Professional artists frequently collaborate, musicians have jam sessions, and pastry chefs still participate in cookie exchanges. And is an accountant saying ""You don’t know what a Form 4868 is?"" really so unimaginable when reframed as one baker discovering that another doesn't know how to proof yeast?<p>The author himself finds beauty and craftsmanship in his fruit tart recipe ""the fresh fruit on top makes it look really pretty and colorful, and yet it’s deceptively simple to make."" What he fails to realize is that many others see the same beauty, the same joy, and the same sense of craftsmanship in a well-designed algorithm.",1300820238

I convinced him to quit his day job working at a large company.  He has not ever worked outside of a large corporation before.  I am the business/SEO/marketing guy.<p>The kicker is that we are working remotely, he is working in one country, while I am in another country.  The target market for our product is the country where I am based.  At the start, we agreed to this arrangement.<p>I am however finding the strains of working remotely a big stress on this relationship.<p>1.  I don't have visibility on what he is doing, and he is of an introverted nature, so he will never skype me first, I always have to skype him or ask him a question and then he responds.<p>2.  We are expanding and hiring people, and without my technical co-founder on the ground here, it is very difficult to lead technical people.  I have a better relationship with the other technical person in our company because I am on the ground here, I don't think this situation is ideal.<p>3.  Since we started the company, we have pivoted several directions that requires my co-founder to learn a new programming language(objective C), however he has struggled to get up to speed quickly(2 months and no code produced), so we had to hire someone to basically continue product development.<p>4.  I don't feel like he puts in ""extra"" into the company, things like working weekends, coming up with new ideas, etc...<p>I don't know whether I am unrealistic in expecting him to learn a new language, but his inability to do so has shaken my faith in his technical abilities.<p>The product and the company I feel is taking off, we will be trying to raise a seed round soon,  but I am very concerned with my co-founder.  I don't feel like he is a co-founder, I am making all the decisions and he has very little to say about the major directions of our product, just agreeing with me.<p>We are going to raise money soon and I don't know if I can scale the company with my friend and co-founder?   Am I being paranoid?  What should I do?",1300820125

Before the work culture of the whole country went to shit, it used to be that programmers were allowed to learn new things <i>at work</i> instead of having to do so entirely on their own time.

We are obsessed with the idea of making a program run in less time by better utilizing the hardware.<p>Concurrency is a property of the program. It is about describing that multiple events can happen independently of each other.<p>An operating system kernel (old ones) are concurrent but not parallel for instance. Concurrently it will handle multiple users, input from keyboard, network and disk, switch process contexts and so on. Yet, only a single CPU will be doing the task, so everything happens in a serial stream of events.<p>The point where the two blend is when you have a concurrent system and want it to execute faster. Then, you will often find yourself employing parallel tactics to speed the system up. In the OS case, modern NIC's and disk drives have processors on them carrying out tasks in parallel to the CPU. So the system is not strictly concurrent anymore. They also have SMP-capability of course.<p>Parallel but not concurrent systems exist as well. The perhaps best example is a GPU, which is massively parallel (1700+ cores is not uncommon), but all the cores are doing the same thing. Hence, it cannot handle different events at different times with independence.",1300819993

This strikes me as far superior to the old approach where you had to take a buggy or outdated device back to a dealer for a replacement, or sell/donate your existing model to someone if you wanted the improved model. Upgradeable firmware extends the life of the product you bought, generally at zero $ cost and requiring only a few minutes of your time.<p>As a kid I started hacking before I knew the name of the activity, because I liked finding out how things worked and was surprised to discover that many cheap consumer devices had the same components and functionality as higher priced ones, just disabled by a jumper or solder bridge on a circuit board. Later I discovered that many digital devices came with replaceable EPROMs and that carrying out the replacement required only a miniature screwdriver and a little patience. A good chunk of my career has revolved around selling or developing or consulting on making products more modular and user-configurable and arguing against the inherently wasteful approach of planned obsolescence. The increasing popularity of network connections on video players, DVRs, and consoles has been a big factor in getting streaming services like Netflix from concept into reality, since most people don't want to build video servers of their own.<p>I can see why you're pissed off with the blu-ray player that just won't play the disc; it's bad standard setting/QA not to have any kind of fallback handling. But your other player is upgradeable precisely so as to avoid this kind of problem. I bet that was even one of the selling points in the product description. I'm baffled that you consider this so much hassle you would prefer to use an inferior technology.",1300819474

2355658,story,,,1,0,bootdaddy,"Ask HN: Funding potential of non-hack founder",,"After reading the great info and essays, I notice that all founders are considered to be hackers. Is there no room for a strategic visionary who can build small quaility teams and make things happen? Have you funded a company with a non-hack ""animal"" founder?
By way of background, I formed a start-up in 2004, that combined a unique electro-mechanical boot device with prop financial software and 24/7 call center to manage vehicular debt collections for small gov't entities.  (Don't bash, we effectively turned booting from a punitive event into a biz transaction, back on road in <5 minutes) I realize now that we chose an expensive and very difficult market. My primary cofounder was a pseudo-hacker and razor sharp biz guy, and the secondary founder was/is a brilliant hack. When speaking to partners or competitors, I would say and believe ""my smart guy is waaaay smarter than your smart guy!"" True it is.
After pumping all of my former stockbroker career earnings into company, plus 2 2nd mortgages, I went from CEO to full time fund raiser for 2 yrs. 
At the 11th hour met a mini Buffet wall st legend at cocktail and had check for $500k 3 days later. Until I had faced failure numerous times, I could not take the ""care"" out of the pitch. Finally, I made the carefree, cocky n confidant (not dicky) elevator pitch of lifetime. Investor paid $2.6mil a few months later for 46% - doing < $1.5mil rev. Defines LUCK!
Along the way: kept the co-founders together during near brawl in conf room over working/communication style between them; sacrificed marriage w work (div pending); got sober! (Yeah, start-up will test your metal and make you more of what you are - I am obsessive/addictive); thru the fist fight of this start-up I laughed and cried and felt energized like never before.
Today, hack is CEO but spends most time developing our next product from home which according to other in-house hacks is most remarkable, like nothing they have ever seen and downright confounding. Pseudo-hack co-founder is president, deal maker, legal guy, and all around kick ass motivator.
I still retain 49% and 2 of 5 seats after a few cap calls. Buyers circling at $20-25mil. The biggest contract in industry ($35mil) is almost secured and chairman thinks $50mil+ next few years based on reasonable ebitda mult.
Looking back, I was the ""animal"" in the company, the money, the salesman, the team builder, the strategic, the attitude adjuster. 
In my expereince, being this guy allowed our hack to hack, and our psuedo hack to help ignite creative ideas w our hack. 
While I understand that there are plenty of biz opps out there, my feeling is that some require mad people skills to get customers, partners, and investors to move. That in turn enables the hack(s) to stay focused.
So, have you considered an investment in trio where a founder is not hack - able, but pure animal?
Sorry for being long winded. Maybe I was just the $ after all!
Btw - not looking for $ as I am involved in another start-up that I will post about in a few months. thx",1300818103

Sorry for my misunderstanding.  I thought you were using ""Bohmian"" to refer to the standard interpretation.

That's just begging the question.  The ""nearly-1 probability"" comes from the assumption that the initial state in the algorithm is a superposition over a large number of classical states.<p><pre><code>  > what you are rejecting is not any particular

How can you work with computers all day and still have a problem with the concept of a firmware upgrade?<p>Forgot to mention: Blu-ray is considerably more consumer-friendly than DVD in terms of region coding. BR players must support region coding (although this is easily defeatable because it's not part of the AACS DRM) - but there are only 3 regions rather than DVD's 6, and most publishers have opted not to use region coding. So when I wanted to get a collectible edition of <i>Inception</i> for my wife at Christmas but limited availability in the US had pushed the price above $1000(!), I got a UK edition for about $70. The included DVD won't play in a consumer player due to region coding, but the Blu-ray disc is just fine.

Additionally, when this happens, I have noticed definite slowdowns in page rendering and the responsiveness of the browser as a whole.<p>I've seen this behavior on my two machines: WinXP and Win7 (64-bit).<p>I have also seen Chrome using an excessive amount of memory on both machines. The reason for this, most of the time, is due to Chrome's design. As I'm sure you're aware, nearly each tab and plugin requires a separate process to allow for features like preventing the closing of the entire browser when a plugin crashes or dragging-and-dropping tabs from/to separate windows, etc. However, this is a trade-off between features vs memory usage, and Chrome's will inherently use more RAM than a browser like Firefox which doesn't follow the same process-spawning design.<p>This is the most common cause for excessive RAM usage, which could be labeled as user error (you shouldn't have so many tabs open, gosh darnit!!) but this isn't the only cause for Chrome's excessive RAM usage. I've definitely seen big spikes of memory being taken up for individual tabs, without any apparent reason. I've never taken out the time to really investigate the cause of this, but if it's not WebKit memory leaks I'm not sure what makes sense to blame.<p>Honestly, it has gotten better in the last few releases, but still not up to the bar Firefox 4 just brought it to. That browser just got so <i>fast</i> and lightweight. I switched to Chrome (and have stayed for a while) because I really dig its interface, and it feels fast. But lately, I've been dealing with weird performance issues especially when these unkillable child processes are present. I love Chrome for development though, it's got a really good set of tools right out of the box.<p>Basically, if Chrome's process spawning stuff was rock solid I would think it's just about perfect, and now I'm starting to think FF4 is getting there faster.<p>*Note: definitely not trying to start a debate on which browser is better, I use both and I like both, but I was just elaborating on what I had said about performance before.",1300816875

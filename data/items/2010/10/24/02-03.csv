1825063,story,,,22,41,fnl,"Ask HN: Multiprocessing & concurrency: C, Python, Clojure (& Go :))?",,"I've never looked into Clojure so far (sorry :) but how does this compare to OpenMP(I)? Or even with Python's parallel processing capacities? How much would performance difference vs. implementation ease be between a C MPI and Clojure parallel processing implementation? Or how would Clojure's MP libraries compare to Python's multiprocessing.JoinableQueue and Manager? Would it be worth considering learning Clojure? And, yes, I know I should learn a new language per year, but then I would at least like to know how it compares to Go - as I am considering that because of the channels, but I now often hear Clojure named alongside Go for exactly those reasons.<p>So, just from the MPI perspective: Clojure, maybe Go, and Python or C(++), what are you using and why?",1287889116

1825042,comment,1824690,1824690,0,0,jrockway,,,"If you are new to mechanical keyboards, I recommend a Cherry Brown-based keyboard.  They have a great tactile feel that quickly trains you to recognize that a key is typed without having to bottom out.<p>I prefer the Topre switches, but the tactile bump is very subtle and if you do not consciously make the effort to not bottom out (initially), you will.  And then it's just a very very expensive rubber-dome keyboard.<p>(The reason you use mechanical keyboards is so that you don't have to bottom out -- slam your fingers against an unyielding piece of plastic thousands of times a day.  If you don't realize that and treat your mechanical keyboard like a $3 rubber-dome keyboard, then you are not going to get the comfort that they are supposed to provide.  Rubber dome keyboards are bad because the keys only register when you bottom out, forcing you to hurt your hands in order to produce any text.)<p>Also, if you've used a Model M and hated it, it's because it's bad.  You have to apply quite a bit of force to the keys (80g, compared to 35g on a Realforce), and that can be painful.  Model Ms make a really fucking cool sound and are built like tanks, but they are otherwise not particularly special.  I used to use one, but after switching to a HHKB, I could not go back.<p>Finally, clicky keyboards are really cool, but the Cherry Browns (""tactile"") are a lot easier to type on than the Cherry Blues (""clicky"").  I am not really sure why, but the Browns feel ""sandpapery"" (try it and see) when they register, but the Blues just make a loud noise.  The rough feeling is much easier to recognize while typing than the sound, IMHO.<p>If you can, try each type before buying, but if you can't, forget about clicky and go for Brown.  If you like the Cherry Brown-based keyboard but want something higher quality and slightly more ergonomic, then make the step up to the Realforce.",1287888560

While this is not a major issue, compared to the rest, it may certainly increase support costs, which may not be allowable if you're working on Enterprise software with a huge userbase.<p>2) It would require a nonstandard UI widget in order to display the username in cleartext while hiding the password in the same field.  If you're designing for the web, this means you're messing with people on mobile devices, which are a fast-growing segment of the population.<p>3) If space is the delimiter for username/password, it means that you can't use space in your username.  I HATE when you can't use space in your username and possibly in your password, depending upon on how well-designed and well-followed your spec is and becomes.  For one, I prefer having my username as ""Dan Hulton"", not ""DanHulton"", though that's a minor quibble.  More importantly, more entropy is more better, and allowing people to use spaces in their usernames/passwords encourages the use of passphrases, which are LEAGUES better than passwords.<p>Also, having separate warnings for your username and password matches is a bad security practice.  Best to just say ""username/password combination not found"" instead of letting a potential hacker know he's stumbled upon a valid username.",1287888546

But in aggregate, if I'm a friend of yours I can get a lot of value out of your twitter stream. It's a quick and easy way to keep up with the random comings & goings of your life. It's an easy way for you to share these things with your circle of friends.<p>It's the same thing with where you are and what you're doing. Maybe you check in at a fancy restaurant and then someone sends you a quick text telling you that a particular dish is a must order.  Maybe you check in at the movies saying you're seeing the new James Bond and then someone asks you about it the next day.  Maybe you check in at a bar after work and a friend you haven't seen in a while stops by to say hello.  Each checkin (like a tweet) is a small look into your life that you've chosen to share with your friends.  Individually, they aren't so useful, but in aggregate it adds up.<p>And it gets even bigger if you are part of a medium to large sized community of people all using foursquare. I like to tell people it's a little bit like telepathy. Foursquare lets me know that when my buddies get tired and go home, I can pop over the the place a couple blocks over and meet up with another crew over there. Foursquare gives me a snapshot of nearly everything going on in my ""social universe"" right now. It makes it easier to connect, more often, with all of my friends.<p>-harryh, foursquare",1287887176

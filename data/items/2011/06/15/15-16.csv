The lack of meaningful keyboard shortcuts drives me mad. Consider a simple task of switching applications with the Cmd-Tab key: Minimize the only window of your application. Switch to another program, then cmd-tab back to your original program. Where did the window go? Oh, it's still sitting in the dock. So, grab the mouse, go get your window - and if you have 3 monitors (like I do), your mouse can be in a different zip code and it takes a long time just to find the cursor.<p>In fact, I think if we did this study today, we would find that due to bigger screen sizes, it's harder to spot the cursor, which would probably increase ""mousing"" time. However, Apple has 6 modifier keys on a laptop: Shift, Fn, Control, alt, option, and cmd, so trying to remember these keys can be a challenge too (and drives me crazy as well).

The defect can't be fixed as to the existing cases, putting all pending RH cases in jeopardy.<p>3. The judge found serious procedural misconduct by RH and gave it two weeks to ""show cause,"" in writing, why it should not be sanctioned. Court rules say you have to disclose the name of anyone who has a financial stake in the litigation. RH failed to do so concerning Stephens Media, which holds a 50% right to any recovery. It failed to do so in <i>any</i> of the 200 cases filed in Nevada, leaving the judge seriously disturbed by this and by other RH misrepresentations made to the court. Thus, not only will RH likely get bounced in all its cases, it will probably have to pay a pretty penny for having abused the court's processes in putting on its charade. No more devastating outcome could be imagined for a litigation campaign of this type.<p>4. Perhaps the most interesting tidbit that came out: in an editorial, Sherman Frederick, formerly of the Las Vegas Review-Journal, had threatened to introduce his ""little friend called Righthaven"" to those who published his paper's content, an unmistakable reference to Al Pacino's ""little friend"" in the movie <i>Scarface</i>, an M-16 machine gun with grenade launcher - capturing in brief the hubris behind the whole RH campaign and perhaps more than anything else explaining why this judge has decided to make RH pay for that hubris.<p>An appeal is inevitable but, for now, RH is watching its business model crumble.",1308151883

First off, a pen test is often treated the same as an attorney client relationship.   If the test turns up particularly costly bad news,  I've seen a handful of testers have the relationship essentially severed,  received some hard language about talking about it from a lawyer and then received a check from a private account as if the company doesn't want to leave any traces that they actually knew about the problems.   (I'm not joking,  some medium sized companies have done this)<p>With some of the regulations the big missing piece is openness, there is no transparency into it at all.  Any audited company should say who audited them and then after some period of time, 180 days maybe, the audit should be made public.   The business risk is that customers will leave,  in many cases like Playstation Network,  customers effectively can't leave,  they've already invested in something and there isn't an alternative.  In many other cases it's not typically going to be widely publicized.  If the customers can't leave, en mass, there is no business pressure for security and without any transparency the regulations will simply be gamed.",1308151594

When you sleep, something like this happens:<p>The OS is told to wake up your thread after x time has elapsed.  It puts this request into some data structure which it does something like poll from time to time so it knows what thread to wake up at what time.  You are offloading your sort to the OS, which is probably then doing something like putting it into a linked list of timeouts that have been registered (maybe a heap?).  After approximately the allotted time, some mechanism akin to a signal is used to tell your thread to wake up.<p>Also, usually the thread will just sleep AT LEAST as long as you tell it to sleep, but if the system is busy it could sleep a long time more.  Threads can be woken up at the same time or slightly out of order, or 'woken up' only to find that all the cpu's are working on something else, and thus waiting for a time slice, getting one, then waiting again, and not getting to use stdout for <i>weeks</i>.  It's uncommon to see machines with really high load these days, but a 1 core computer with 25000 processes all competing for CPU time, and which is swapping heavily, will potentially run each process millions of times slower than running one process.<p>TLDR; This is curious, but will fail much of the time, has huge memory overhead.  Lots of good sorts are in place, this one requires something like 8mb per thread on linux due to the stack allocated for the thread.

They're partially right. The mainstream US is not the target market. Bitcoin will probably enjoy some mainstream acceptance in the US, but it will probably be a long time from now and occur well after it enjoys mainstream success in some foreign market.<p>The key global feature that makes bitcoin viable is a functioning and reliable postal service.

That's the key piece to get here. In the long-term, regulation of US banks prohibiting bitcoin will hurt banks more than bitcoin, because it just means that they won't be able to participate.<p>The key to a functioning bitcoin economy is not the middlemen such as banks. The key are enough endpoints so that there are enough goods and services you want to buy in bitcoin that uses charge in bitcoin and then maintain the currency until they spend it on a good or service they want.<p>Everyone focuses on the banks and intermediaries, but it's the quantity and diversity endpoints (buyers/sellers) that truly matter.",1308150243

8907406,comment,8907164,8907164,0,0,amitkgupta84,,,"This blog post is painfully stupid.  His point #1 is that posting answers to trivial questions one could easily answer themselves with a Google search is detrimental to good pedagogy.  He then goes on to claim that most of his points came from doing this very thing.  What&#x27;s the logic here?  Behaviour x is bad, I do x on StackOverflow, therefore StackOverflow is bad?  No, SO in itself is not the problem, the author of that post is the problem, and judging by his score, one of the biggest contributors to said problem.<p>His second point is on the poor reward system.  There is no reward system, there are only fake Internet points (and maybe a few things like additional posting or moderation privileges, but nothing of any consequence).  Any &quot;reward&quot; system you feel there to be is what your imagination makes of the fake Internet points.  The gripe about the &quot;cool kids table&quot; just demonstrates a basic ignorance of supply and demand.  The complaint that he&#x27;s scored many points after being inactive on the site is just as inane; if your &quot;work&quot; has value to people even years after producing it, why should you not be &quot;rewarded&quot; for it?<p>Last is his prediction that his 14k reputation would be diminished by the &quot;petty children&quot; who make up the SO community, presumably after they read and became angry with his blog post.  Well, his reputation is now over 19k, so... I suppose it&#x27;s possible that his current score is actually the work of petty children up-voting his questions and answers out of spite for him and his prediction.",1421585855

Something like the Boston Marathon happens and we do the same.<p>Lots of people might, but a lot of the younger generation most certainly doesn&#x27;t - these are black swan events. Given that they don&#x27;t happen more often, I&#x27;d say the Government have more than enough power - you can&#x27;t stop 100% of terrorism, just like you can&#x27;t stop 100% of crime.<p>> We should have a very high threshold for using these communications against people, and making sure they can only be used for matters of the people&#x27;s security.<p>We already have laws which empower the Government with additional powers in cases of &quot;national security&quot;. The result? Suddenly, drug busts are national security.<p>Now, that&#x27;s not to say the Government should not have some well-thought-out powers to combat terrorism if they actually need them. What they have now, and what you are proposing, is not well-thought-out.",1421585854

Should addresses just be used as one big blob of text, and never parsed at all? should there be individual per-country libraries for parsing them? should we just address everything by coordinates (which doesn&#x27;t solve the houseboat problem)? How about a unique identifier for every person on the planet, plus a gps tracking system that guarantees big brother can deliver to you whenever, wherever?<p>Now that the average piece of post is a prig package that needs signing for, rather than a small letter that can just go through the letterbox, I quite like the idea of centralised pigeon-hole buildings, that have existed in many towns as the only method of delivery, but are now being born everywhere thanks to amazon, etc. That&#x27;s quite a different problem, though :-)",1421585308

Building a dialect that people will widely adopt is an extreme edge case: Common Lisp, Scheme, Racket and Clojure are about the only consensus successes after 50 years of Lisp. Yes, there&#x27;s Chicken and AutoLisp and eLisp that are useful for writing against an API, and I&#x27;ve been vague with &quot;Common Lisp&quot;.<p>Arc has a minimalist aesthetic but it has so few resources that it is hard to discuss it as an ecosystem.<p>Arc was intended to be a 100 year language. Like Clojure the easy starter kit hasn&#x27;t been built. Its terseness means expressing yourself requires a grasp of Lisp nuance. Arc is not analogous to Racket&#x27;s Student Languages. Knowing Lisp already is a good predictor of success. There aren&#x27;t a lot of Arc libraries. There are no Arc books. Maybe there&#x27;s more than one tutorial, now. The community is not as vibrant as that of the other Lisps previously mentioned.<p>About the same time [the very distant past in Internet Years] both Paul Graham and Rich Hickey set about killing conversation at cocktail parties with &quot;I&#x27;m writing a dialect of Lisp.&quot;<p>Rich Hickey didn&#x27;t just write a dialect. He didn&#x27;t just design it from the ground up with no cobs. He built a language community. Paul Graham wrote Arc and then dedicatedly built a community. It just wasn&#x27;t a language community. It was the YC program and HN and all the common interest that connects to that.<p>I would not recommended Clojure as a first Lisp for most people. Emacs knowledge, Java Experience, and some Lisp already, are helpful. There&#x27;s a lot more assumption of Computer science as well. But I would over Arc because you can use Google with Clijure. You can use IRC. You can use StackOverflow. There are Clojure conferences, Clojure consultants and Clojure meetings. There are even listservs.<p>Good luck.",1421582846

They realise they can use it to draw strength to help them deal with situations by using it. They arnt taught, they don&#x27;t come across the information on the internet.

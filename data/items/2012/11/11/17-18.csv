4770081,comment,4769381,4769673,1,0,tgflynn,,,"I haven't done much with geographic data myself but I know Google has an API for plotting that kind of data :<p><a href=""http://gislounge.com/how-to-import-data-make-maps-google-fusion-tables/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gislounge.com/how-to-import-data-make-maps-google-fus...</a><p>Beyond that R is a very powerful tool for data analysis.  I would recommend installing RStudio which provides a significantly nicer interface and is available for all major platforms.<p>In R it's easy to load a CSV data file, look at the data and subset it.  It also has good tools for plotting. For exploratory analysis scatter plot matrices are often a good place to start.  It's also easy to do linear regression with the lm command.<p>Beyond that almost every statistical and machine learning model you're likely to have heard of has an R implementation but the documentation is often not easy to read and you may find yourself needing to read research papers just to understand how to use some of the models.<p>In general R is extremely powerful but it has a steep learning curve.  There are quite a number of websites now that have good tutorials for the basics though.<p>I don't know how large your datasets are.  R may have problems dealing with extremely large datasets, though that partly depends on how much memory you have.  If you have millions of rows or more you may want to randomly subsample your data so you can still use R to do some preliminary exploration on it but you may need other tools for building your final models.<p>Another site that may be helpful is <a href=""http://kaggle.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kaggle.com</a>.  I believe they have published a number of writeups on modelling methods by winners of some of the data mining competitions they host.",1352656697

4770079,comment,4768789,4769398,21,0,mattjaynes,,,"I love 37Signals - their products and their content, but this is the biggest issue I have with them - ignoring applicants.<p>I've never shared the story of my efforts in applying to 37Signals, but this seems like a great time :)<p>About 6 months ago, 37Signals advertised for a dedicated Conversion guy/gal:<p><a href=""http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3175-were-hiring-help-us-significantly-improve-conversion-and-retention"" rel=""nofollow"">http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3175-were-hiring-help-us-sign...</a><p>This was very exciting for me. I'd been a long-time 37Signals customer and over the last couple years had been studying and practicing with optimizing the customer life-cycle (conversion, onboarding, retention, etc) with my various contracting clients.<p>I've been more of a backend and devops engineer for much of my career, but I always loved when I'd get to simplify or add enhancements to a site and see the traffic and engagement go up. It had become my side-passion and I devoured all the books and articles I could find on the subject.<p>So I spent several days looking over the 37Signals product marketing and coming up with a strong pitch. The Basecamp landing page was full of classic mistakes and seemed like the lowest hanging fruit to address, so that's what I picked to overhaul.<p>Here's my initial pitch: <a href=""http://yconvert.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yconvert.com/</a><p>I kept thinking about the problem and I realized that the mockup I sent of a new Basecamp landing page was still pretty weak, so I spent some more time revamping it and sent this 2 days later:<p><a href=""http://yconvert.com/redux.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yconvert.com/redux.html</a><p>I still kept thinking about how it could be improved, so I also addressed the Basecamp funnel flow and sent this another 2 days later:<p><a href=""http://yconvert.com/basecamp_funnel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yconvert.com/basecamp_funnel.html</a> via this link-baity tweet: <a href=""https://twitter.com/nanobeep/status/212543236374409216"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/nanobeep/status/212543236374409216</a><p>During this process, I watched my logs carefully and geo-located every IP that hit my application. Sure enough, the guys I wanted to see it had seen it. They also saw every update. They also tried some of my suggestions on the Basecamp landing page. And they also ended an online discussion with a puppy pic (if you reviewed my pitches, you'll know why that is significant).<p>Now, I'm not bitter about being ignored and I don't necessarily think it's evil or anything. I totally understand that folks get busy and things fall through the cracks - but companies should realize that it's often your customers and fans that apply for your jobs.<p>When I'm hiring for something, I'll admit that if I get an application where the person <i>obviously</i> cut-and-pasted a generic cover letter with no thought for the actual job, I may ignore the applicant unless they follow-up. However, if someone puts obvious significant effort into applying personally to my job - I would <i>never</i> ignore them. It's just really bad form.<p>I'm still a 37Signals fan, and I realize that as only one data point, I could just be that one guy they forgot to reply to. But if it's a more common problem, I do hope they change their hiring process to treat their applicants with more kindness and respect.<p>---<p>P.S. I also have to mention that during this process I emailed Patrick McKenzie for advice and he responded immediately with some great and timely counsel. He encouraged me to be persistent and be as engaging as possible, and I applied that the best I could. He's a scholar and a gentleman.",1352656660

As an American who went to grad school in Europe (a technical university) - it was interesting to compare the differences.<p>It begins with the fact that at European universities, there's no real support for encouraging student entrepreneurship. In Sweden for example, they are making some headway with the Stockholm School of Entrepreneurship and other inititiatives (side bar: here's a great lecture with Niklas Zennstrm, off Skype and Andreas Ehn, former CTO of Spotify - <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R_E4GYfZK4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R_E4GYfZK4</a>)<p>There's a long way to go though!<p>Second is the cultural bias. If you are European (or have European friends) you will know that failure it treated quite differently in Europe vis-a-vis the USA.<p>In the USA, should you try a venture and fail, people say ""well at least you tried!"".<p>Or, you write about it in your grad school applications and get in. Then you have a fresh start.<p>Alternatively, you have a CV building experience. Often times, companies will look at your entrepreneurial zest favorably. Or, you can specifically apply to other startups who want people with startup experience.<p>Now, shall we compare that to the European experience?<p>European companies where you get the ""evil eye"" - at best you are looked upon with suspicion.\nAt worst, you don't even get considered.<p>The other issue is that many private universities in the USA are funded by wealthy business alumni. So there remains a strong relationship between industry and academia. The least of this is endowment money making its way to top VC's.<p>The last point is about cultural bias towards profit-seeking. In the USA, many socially conscious entrepreneurs see business and profits as a way not only to get wealthy, but to make the world a better place - create jobs, fund nonprofits, etc. The unhealthy notion that still exists in Europe (business owners are greedy capitalists that need to be bled dry), just won't work.<p>The best engineers and business dev/sales talent in Europe still seek out working for established companies. There's no ""peer push"" towards starting your own company.   The elusive job security (which is quickly fading) is what people seek out.<p>Real entrepreneurs see owning a business as the secure option. Job employment and placing your future in someone else's hands seems insanely risky to us.<p>Family and friends deride the European entrepreneur who has this same mentality. This can affect relationships with loved ones and the like. Hell, even getting a mortgage or other normal activities is harder as a entrepreneur in Europe.<p>Of course, there's probably some hidden opportunity in these challenges as well.

This factor becomes even less surprising if the app is promoted in the Win8 app store, or if it is one of the few card game apps, etc.  Also, this number is downloads, so maybe people grabbed it, checked it out and deleted it.  I haven't looked into specifics.  But given the size of the ecosystem, the number doesn't seem unreasonable.<p>To follow up on gushiness, as others have commented, this particular post was on MSDN which is a Microsoft property.  Microsoft has a pretty decent infrastructure for developer support (and has had for a long while).  A lot of people working within the Microsoft development ecosystem like the tools, the platform, etc.  A person, employee or not, posting about his positive experiences is to be expected.<p>For myself, I'm eh on Win8.  I see the ""Metro"" interface as an oversized task bar/start menu for what is a better/faster desktop experience.  That said, I mainly use my Mac.

Sure, it's math, and once you pick the right model, there is (usually) one correct way to solve it. The problem is that most mathematical methods come with assumptions that are almost never met in practice, so you have to make a lot of (often fairly arbitrary) decisions about how to go about your data analysis. How do you handle missing data cases? Is your data normally distributed enough to justify the use of some method? Is the sample large enough? Are those residuals in your model diagnostics random enough? Does that trend line look linear enough? What prior information can I use (and how?) to formally add value to the model?

We had 3 million some people in this country in 1790. We now have over 300 million. That same span saw the introduction of technology which DESTROYED the agricultural livelihood most people relied on. Meanwhile, the colonial american would have to compete against 100 times as many applicants today as he would have back then. So why aren't we all unemployed? Why do so many different decades, with wildly different technological and demographic situations, always face roughly the same unemployment rates?<p>Because employment faces feedback forces on both ends of the employment spectrum.<p>When people are idle, they want to do something, so they create ways to be useful to others in exchange for things. In today's America, people will bring hot pizza to your door in minutes.<p>Such an enterprise would have cost an unimaginable fortune in 1790 (you would have had to invent a network of roads... and the automobile... and electricity).<p>But every invention that makes pizza delivery possible, roads and cars and electricity, threatened to destroy some other industry (horses, wax candles?). As the candlemaker was losing his industry, he couldn't even envision the role of a pizza delivery driver. It makes no sense in his world. So of course, to him, everything looks dire.<p>You might think that we've never seen technological shifts as potent as today, that somehow this time it's different. But that ignores history. The overnight displacement of all industrial manufacturing by robots would be a blip compared to the decimation of agricultural labor over the last century plus. The economy is far more diversified now, and even within the sector, a smaller percentage of jobs would be lost. We survived the productivity boom in agriculture just fine.

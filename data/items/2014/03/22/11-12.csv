Let&#x27;s say a one pound coin costs 1.5 pounds to make, with half a pound of raw materials, so that 1 pound is lost over its lifetime. In 30 years, that coin may change hands, 5000 times, so that the loss per transaction is .02 cents)<p>You could make it expensive to make a coin by putting more than the nominal value worth of raw material in each coin, but that, obviously, is a bad idea for a different reason: people would recycle the money.<p>So, a solution must be sought in making it hard to make coins. Any complicated technology will work.<p>The mentioned electroplating method might be such a technology. I think it might even be possible to write a pattern over the surface of the coin by using techniques similar to those used in chip making. Unbeatable? No, but it might drive the cost of counterfeiting a coin up enough to kill the market, that is, until somebody figures out a cheap way to replicate the technology, or until somebody finds a just good enough approximate technology that beats the scanners.",1395489502

One example is Basic Job - if you need a job real bad the government gives you a really bad job.<p>This has no poverty traps, and (unlike BI) has no disincentive for work.

7448693,comment,7445685,7446446,1,0,bertil,,,"The closest example of something similar that I can think of are Nordic countries: there is very little verification on your claims (outside of records associated to a constantly used unique identifier) and the entitlements are significant. It works rather well there, but it generally comes with a pre-existing massive social pressure that prevents any abuse; Finland might be the exception to that social monitor (people really do <i>anything</i> and no one would care) but still has an administration with strong ‘socialist’ or equalitarian concerns. I’m embroiled myself in a weird administration imbroglio, and they have shined so far, but I’ll let you know.<p>More important than an isolated case in a jar, what you need to care about is immigration: any Southern European nationalist will decry your policy as a potential tsunami from Africa. The lack of tension between the oil-money-infused Norway and its neighbours are striking when you compare that to Irak and Kuwait; at best, they associate the higher-priced-better-quality Statoil gas station with Norwegian snobism (I didn’t notice <i>any</i> snobism).<p>The significant economic success of Finland seems to favor the model. It helps that their chosen field of specialty, video games, is a complex, creative endeavour where success is fleeting and hard to reproduce, revenues are spectacularly unbalanced and business models a constant struggle. This means that most of the ‘idle’ youngsters are actually creating something: playing and learning what makes games cool, or starting their own fan-art, mods, league, reprise… the stepping stones of creativity.<p>Same thing in more Southern countries: it seems to cost roughly the same to pay someone to stay at home and grow their garden rather than to pay an industrial conglomerate to stay and keep on hiring them. Job insurance is regularly described as the largest Angel fund.<p>The closest to an MVP you’ll get might be a small state, say Iceland, that has something similar already. The real issue is not product, but interoperability: what happens when you have migrants, double-nationals, and is it safe to end up with a generation that grew up not knowing anyone who works at all?<p>You might consider a different form of it, with some voluntary civil service to teach basic skills (say, open to elderly and handicapped, substitutable with pregnancy or child-rearing) and make that life revenue a retirement from service, or stipend.",1395489031

They both use simple up/down systems.<p>The point is that Slashdot&#x27;s metamoderation system better leverages the community as a means of <i>directing</i> discussion. The initial upvote has a <i>reason</i> attached to it, and the meta level moderation allows the community to filter out people that are moderating inappropriately.

To detect a valid coin, the machine has a set of n standard values for a real coin &#x27;C&#x27; at a range of (λ_1, λ_2) pairs I_C_{λ_1_i}_{λ_2_i} for i in [1, n].<p>To pass, a coin c has to match within a tolerance, i.e. for all i in [1, n], |I_C_{λ_1_i}_{λ_2_i} - I_c_{λ_1_i}_{λ_2_i}| < ε.<p>I am assuming that the set of I_C_{λ_1_i}_{λ_2_i}, and the (λ_1_i, λ_2_i) values will be public knowledge, because they are needed by privately manufactured machines working with coins.<p>The aim of a counterfeiter is to find substances s_j and the concentrations in which to mix in α_j for j in 1..l (to a base that has no fluorescence), so that the mixture c passes the intensity tests within tolerance. If we assume the substances do not affect each other significantly, then we can expect that<p>I_c_{λ_1_i}_{λ_2_i} = Σ_{j=1}^l α_j I_norm_{s_j}_{λ_1_i}_{λ_2_i}.<p>Using an off the shelf spectrofluorometer (or even a modified coin reader) a counterfeiter could obtain the I_s_{λ_1_i}_{λ_2_i} for a wide variety of substances s, which can be normalised to be per unit of concentration.<p>Given a bank of substances s_j for i in 1..l (the counterfeiter can choose an l that is large enough to make the attack work), with known I_{s_j}_{λ_1_i}_{λ_2_i} values, it is easy to solve for a least squares concentrations vector α. Let A be an l by n vector such that A_ij = I_norm_{s_j}_{λ_1_i}_{λ_2_i}. Let y be the column vector such that y_i = I_C_{λ_1_i}_{λ_2_i}.<p>Let t(A) denote the transpose of vector A. Using the simplex algorithm, solve t(A)y = t(A)A \\hat{α}, subject to all concentrations being greater than or equal to zero, yielding the least squares solution \\hat{α}. If the result is within tolerance, the counterfeiter has a viable solution, if not they need a larger or different pool of starting substances.<p>In practice, they might want to reduce the number or cost of substances they use. They could use an optimisation method such as a genetic algorithm to find the lowest cost set (taking into account set size and the price of substances) that results in an acceptable \\hat{α} solution.<p>Of course, these coins are fairly low value, and in practice counterfeiting the coins might not be that profitable anyway given the low value of the coins and the amount of labour needed to get any significant amount of real currency in exchange for the coins without detection, so someone capable of making a counterfeit might be able to use their skills more profitably elsewhere.",1395488513

You need to imagine how people from whom you haven’t heard anything make decisions.<p>‘The community has always agreed on most points’ (“HN has always been like that”) and ‘there is no problem for contrarian opinions’ (“I&#x27;m not yet convinced that this will be a huge problem”) should be considered violently contradictory statements. That policy might not make things worst because there has never been that much discussion -- but it won’t fix the reason for bad comments which are usually two-fold:<p>* people don’t know how they could phrase one (I’ve turned every one of “Aha-ha! You are dumb…” into a more insightful questioning dozens of times on other sites.);<p>* contrarian feel excluded, powerless, and react poorly or violently.

She seemed a tad petulant and more than a tad eager to please Sen. Sanders and offer a markedly animated and rosy account of her country&#x27;s system than the rest of the representatives from Taiwan, Denmark and France.<p>Anyway here are some unvarnished facts about the share of things that plague the Canadian system.<p><pre><code>  &quot;In 2011, a significant number of Canadians—an estimated \n  46,159—received treatment outside of the country.&quot;\n  ...\n  &quot;At the same time, the national median wait time for \n  treatment after consultation with a specialist increased from \n  9.3 weeks in 2010 to 9.5 weeks in 2011. Among the provinces, \n  wait times from consultation with a specialist to treatment \n  decreased in six provinces, rising only in Manitoba, Ontario, \n  New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.&quot; \n  ...\n  &quot;In some cases, these patients needed to leave Canada due to \n  a lack of available resources or a lack of appropriate \n  procedure/technology. In others, their departure will have \n  been driven by a desire to return more quickly to their lives,\n  to seek out superior quality care, or perhaps to save their \n  own lives or avoid the risk of disability. Clearly, the \n  number of Canadians who ultimately receive their\n  medical care in other countries is not insignificant.&quot;[1]\n\n  &quot;Wait times for health care in Canada have stalled at historically\n  high levels, in spite of current government strategies aimed at \n  improved timeliness. Canadians wait longer than citizens of many \n  other OECD countries with universal access health care systems, \n  from emergency room visits to physician consultations to elective\n   surgeries, despite Canada’s relatively large health expenditures.&quot;\n   ...\n  &quot;Failing to fix wait times has affected the economic well-being of \n   Canadians in a number of important ways. One estimate, from the  \n   Centre for Spatial Economics assessing just four procedures – \n   total joint replacement surgery, cataract surgery, coronary \n   artery bypass graft surgery, and MRI scans – found that excessive\n   waits were costing Canadians $14.8 billion, plus another $4.4 billion\n  ($19.2 billion,together) in lost government revenues from reduced \n   economic activity.&quot;[2]\n</code></pre>\nI dislike offering anecdotal evidence because it appeals to emotion and not reason.<p>All I can say is I&#x27;m acutely familiar with the Canadian system on more than one level.<p>All of this is not to put too fine a point on how single payer systems are terrible in their own way.<p>It is to indicate that no matter which system we side with we are confronted with a more or less\nequally (depending on who you ask) dreadful trade-off of horrors.<p>I&#x27;m not going to dump links here to the scores of Daily Mail reports, to offer as proof of how \n&quot;efficiently&quot;, the British system under the auspices of the NHS, works. You can Google it yourself \n&quot;NHS site:dailymail.co.uk&quot; )<p>The point is that vested interests on either side always make the other option look barbaric.<p>Some prefer a system where every manner of medical malady can be treated skillfully and \nexpediently, right here within our shores without extended wait times, by distinguished medical \nexperts with a tremendous case experience in a given line of treatment, be it Hodgkin \nlymphoma or Parkinson&#x27;s or Multiple Sclerosis.<p>Some prefer that everyone last person in the country has an &quot;on-paper&quot; access to free and need-based \nhealthcare.<p>Some like David Goldhill want to entirely scrap the insurance model in favor of a radical direct pay model - where everyone pays out of pocket for most common procedures and office visits and thereby largely expunging the role of insurance companies. In 2007, David Goldhill&#x27;s father was admitted to a New York City hospital with pneumonia, and five weeks later he died there from multiple hospital-acquired infections.\n[3]<p>Your outlook is shaped by how healthy you are or how diseased you are. How your family coped with various medical hardships in the past or how everyone you know has always been blessed with bountiful health. How a certain system excludes things that you think should be offered by any self-respecting medical system, for the well-being of its public.<p>At the end of the day, most sensible people anywhere in the world would want to pay for a system that they see some utility out of, without adverse consequences.<p>A sick person&#x27;s utility is different from a hale one&#x27;s.<p>A salaryman&#x27;s utility (with his cautious life choices and lifestyle) is structurally different from a \nfreewheeling thrill seeker&#x27;s.<p>After all how is it fair that you are admitted into a ward for a routine fracture and contract some deadly MRSA bacterium from a guy who just returned from a safari in Belize?

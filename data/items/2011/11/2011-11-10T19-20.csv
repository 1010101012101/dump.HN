3221583,comment,3221422,3221534,3,0,gbelote,,,"> So if Groupon stopped giving cash up front they shouldn't lose any customers they need, right?<p>That's not strong supporting evidence. Cash up front is one of the incentives that Groupon uses to acquire customers. Dropping it would certainly lose at least a few customers. They have a shit-ton of customers, doing many things would lose them customers. But it's not the core value proposition of Groupon.<p>Now if Groupon stopped advertising your business and discount to their enormous email list and <i>only</i> gave you cash advance in exchange for future revenue and they <i>don't</i> lose much business, then it starts looking more like what the OP claims.",1320955130

The employee does not yet own the unvested shares, but they do have a contractual right to them. Terminating someone just to screw them out of a contractual right you agreed to in a contract is going to give someone ammo in a lawsuit.<p>Given its pre-IPO situation, Zynga is in a bad leverage position in the face of such a lawsuit. They're going to have an incentive to settle just to get the claims to go away. What they probably should have done instead is to terminate the employees for performance up front with a generous severance package and a contractual agreement to not sue the company for improper termination.

3221565,comment,3220527,3221480,1,0,bradleyland,,,"> I wonder if the following was ever said about Apple in the past?<p>Probably not, but these are different markets, and Apple is in a drastically different position.<p>I don't own a crystal ball, and I try not to pretend I do, but I do like to play devil's advocate, so I'll take the opposite position here and say that fragmentation <i>does</i> matter in the post-PC market because Apple managed to define the segment, first with the iPhone and followed it up with the iPad.<p>With the iPhone and iPad, consumers who are used to the traditional PC computing experienced were introduced to a closed-loop vendor relationship. For all the warts that we (geeks) see, this is a fantastic experience for many consumers.<p>Case in point: this last week, I was in Ohio (I live in Florida). I had a problem with my MacBook Pro, and I had none of the things I needed to fix it. I used the Apple Store app to schedule a Genius appointment, dropped my laptop off, had lunch, and walked out of the store with a fully functional laptop, all within the span of a couple hours. My partners now take this level of service for granted. We recently switched to all Apple equipment after very positive experiences with iPhones and iPads.<p>When you contrast this to the typical PC vendor relationship, there are stark contrasts:<p>* Where do I take my Dell/HP/Acer computer to be repaired?<p>* When I call Dell/HP/Acer, what is the experience like?<p>* What are the costs associated with the repair?<p>In the case of Apple, it's Apple, Apple, and (often) zero. I have AppleCare on my MacBook Pro, but as it turns out, it didn't matter. Apple will perform simple software fixes at the Genius Bar for free, even if you're not covered by warranty. Are there cases where it would have cost me money? Plenty, but there wouldn't be any confusion over who I need to talk to. This leads to a high level of satisfaction [1].<p>Fragmentation has a significant impact on the consumer experience. ""Android"" has become a brand, but there is no consistency in revision, manufacturer, or expectation of service. All of these lead to open questions and insecurities in the minds of consumers. As the price of the device and term of commitment extends in to hundreds of dollars and multiple years, the opportunity for a negative experience compounds. Next thing you know, Uncle Dave is standing in the Verizon store frustrated because the counter clerk doesn't know why all his email account won't work with his phone. Why can't he run the app he just downloaded from the internet? When will updates be available for his phone? Lot's of open questions.<p>1 - <a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/09/apple-tops-j-d-power-customer-satisfaction-survey-grim-reading/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/09/apple-tops-j-d-power-cust...</a>",1320954916

Does that really sound satisfying to you? Real and honest? I understand that manipulating people into forming a relationship (of whatever kind) with you can somewhere in the end resemble something like a genuine relationship. But that still doesn't make it a genuine relationship. It either is a runway and you are a tower operator, or not.<p>If you define a relationship as one where two people occupy the same room and have frequent conversations then a lot of things are a relationship - all the way to a torture chamber. What I'm talking about is two people who really care about each other.<p>'The Game' is very particularly about getting women into bed. Being in bed together is usually related to a deep, emotional connection, but pickup artists just care about that last bit. To stay in the metaphor: They really, really do care about making those cargo planes appear. Boy do they ever love that cargo. They do everything they have seen others do to provoke the kind of reaction from the planes that they have observed. What they don't care so much about is what those planes are, why they usually care about ACTUAL runways and care about having a very good reason to drop off their cargo.<p>Because if they did care to understand, they'd very quickly see how pathetic it is to sit in that makeshift straw hut pretending to be an international airport.<p>So yes, Radix is correct - that's what I'm talking about. What ends up on the runway are either pilots who actually wanted to be somewhere else and try their best to take off as fast as possible, or are other islanders who push their own wooden boxes with straw wings onto the dirt road.<p>[edit] Maybe the easiest way to sum this up is: The fact that cargo arrives on your dirt runway doesn't make you a proper army radio tower operator. The fact that you score women or get people to do things that you want doesn't make you a good partner or friend.",1320952922

3221386,comment,3218806,3219447,1,0,philwelch,,,"""A newly invented metaphor assists thought by evoking a visual image, while on the other hand a metaphor which is technically ""dead"" (e.g. iron resolution) has in effect reverted to being an ordinary word and can generally be used without loss of vividness. But in between these two classes there is a huge dump of worn-out metaphors which have lost all evocative power and are merely used because they save people the trouble of inventing phrases for themselves. Examples are: Ring the changes on, take up the cudgel for, toe the line, ride roughshod over, stand shoulder to shoulder with, play into the hands of, no axe to grind, grist to the mill, fishing in troubled waters, on the order of the day, Achilles' heel, swan song, hotbed. Many of these are used without knowledge of their meaning (what is a ""rift,"" for instance?), and <i>incompatible metaphors are frequently mixed, a sure sign that the writer is not interested in what he is saying</i>. Some metaphors now current have been twisted out of their original meaning without those who use them even being aware of the fact. For example, toe the line is sometimes written as tow the line. Another example is the hammer and the anvil, now always used with the implication that the anvil gets the worst of it. In real life it is always the anvil that breaks the hammer, never the other way about: a writer who stopped to think what he was saying would avoid perverting the original phrase.""<p>--George Orwell, ""Politics and the English Language"", 1946 (emphasis added)",1320952810

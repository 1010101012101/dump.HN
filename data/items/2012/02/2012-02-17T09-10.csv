Thank god for application launchers in any case.<p>Because you can organise them, group related stuff together and so on as opposed to having a single long list. I admit that I don't really use it (I prefer stacks in the dock) but it's better than the application folder.<p>> And they did screw with the old ui stuff in Lion. For example, they completely fucked up Spaces when they merged everything into Mission Control. It now takes twice as long to move between spaces; you're treated to a stupid iOS-style ""fade in"" animation, wasting even more of your time; the steps to move a window between spaces is now more complicated; and they removed rows. Why? I assume they wanted to make it look exactly the way it does on iOS, where you just have a horizontal series of windows.<p>Fair enough, I didn't really use Spaces previously so I'd not noticed the changes, though I'm not sure what you mean about the fade in. Mine transitions very quickly between spaces with no fade in.<p>> This is simple and intuitive. It's also stupid as hell.<p>Can you explain this? Simple and intuitive are good.

Mobile Safari's DOM rendering is all sorts of wacky and requires a frustrating amount of non-intuitive workarounds, but with regards to the orientation issues you mention, browsers haven't really had to deal with rotating displays until fairly recently. So, I can understand not <i>liking</i> the implementation decisions someone made, but attributing it to malice seems a bit absurd.<p>.. and unless there are some undocumented tricks I haven't come across, I've found web development for Android devices to be a truly unholy mess, significantly worse than Safari.",1329469685

I do think it's great to have a sandbox provided by the OS, but IMO the default rule should be: ""no access"", then the developer could tick all legitimate uses for the application, if this happens to be unrestricted access, so be it. I think this is especially true with the new upcoming code signing feature in Mountain Lion.",1329469630

What I would say was ""settled in 1996"" was the fact that cookies are a useful technical measure to enable websites to save state, and users wanted features like login persistence across browser sessions, etc.<p>I don't think that ""unlimited user tracking by advertising networks, regardless of good-faith user efforts to limit data tracking"" was at all part of any tacit agreements reached by the internet community. The principle that communication networks should be transparent in how they operate, and allow users of the network to meaningfully control their interactions with them is a meta-principle that is pretty clearly implicit in the design of the internet, and I don't think the current widespread use of tracking technologies and data analysis without informed user consent is consistent with those principles.",1329469554

Ask the Linux kernel guys about GCC's code generation oddities.""<p>You don't even have to go as far as kernel developers. From a 'write once, compile everywhere' perspective, GCC is actually pretty bad. I used to work at a company that built and deployed to somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 different *nix platforms, over 6 different hardware architectures, running various GCC versions. Working around version- or backend-specific GCC issues was almost a daily task, and it wasn't getting any better with later versions.<p>It's not that GCC is 'bad', but it's not holy either, not by any stretch of imagination. There's a reason Apple decided to push clang as an alternative. I believe clang+LLVM will some day replace GCC on Linux and other platforms that use GCC as well.",1329469310

It is generally found in things that are not good for you regardless of how they are sweetened.<p>We know an impressive amount about how human nutrition works--but there is much more that we don't know. When some giant food company decides to make something by taking ingredients, breaking them down, and putting them together in some new engineered food there are two risks. (1) Being good for you may not have been high on the design requirements. Shelf life, consistency, ease of manufacture, cost, and marketing concerns could all be higher on the list. (2) Even if being good for you was a high priority, they might not actually achieve that due to our incomplete knowledge of human nutrition.<p>When you see HFCS on the label, you know there is a really good chance you are dealing with an engineered food.<p>In other words, HFCS is not bad--it just keeps bad company.",1327131849
3492934,comment,3492711,3492860,5,0,mbreese,,,"Don't forget that this was the era when Fox also cancelled Family Guy and Futurama. Both of these series were able to be resurrected due to their DVD sales and syndication numbers. Fox made a lot of mistakes during that time, but were just learning about the secondary sales potential for their shows. I'd like to think that a similar set of shows would be able to stick around longer now. Those shows were able to be resurrected easily because they are animated. Firefly, not so much. But another show (Arrested Development) cancelled by Fox in that era is getting resurrected by Netflix, which while not <i>straight to consumer</i> is more direct than through the studios.<p>Also, Joss Whedon (and the rest of Hollywood) I think learned a lot about distributing directly to the consumer with Dr. Horrible's Sing-along Blog. I think that this grand experiment was a good template for future direct-to-consumer productions.<p>Unfortunately, you still have to deal with the problems of initially funding large movies. I can imagine a system where instead of having dedicated studios, you have smaller one-off production companies. These companies would then be funded VC style by funds that seek to mitigate their risk by diversifying their pool of movies.

Rather, we just need to reach a certain level of efficiency: as soon as one person can produce enough of something for, say, several thousand--something completely reasonable with today's technology--you start reaching the point where you do <i>not</i> need everybody working.<p>Just because your power plant employs some people--and it probably really is just a handful--does not mean everybody has to work. The same is true for agriculture; one farmer is already extremely effective, and with the advent of cheap robotics[1] they are poised to become more efficient yet.<p>[1]: Something like: <a href=""http://www.harvestai.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.harvestai.com/</a><p>""Whom to pay"" is a loaded question--we have already reached, or are rapidly reaching, a point where society can exist happily <i>without</i> everybody pitching in. Why should anybody's saying their creation powers things actually matter?<p>Of course, my argument isn't really about getting rid of payment or even the capitalistic system. Rather, it is about extending a recent trend: the increasing minimum standard of living. In a perfect world, you would be able to subsist comfortably without working. Of course, there are plenty of other ways to motivate people: status, luxury items...etc.<p>So, given increases in efficiency and different sources of motivation, I do not see why a capitalist society with plenty of people not working is impossible. Now, I doubt transitioning there would be easy: too many people are emotionally set against freeloaders. If we actually needed everybody to work, this would be great; however, as technology progresses and this is needed less and less, it stops being great.<p>Of course, there is one glaring whole in my argument (or, at least, one I'm pointing out): we may not be at the requisite level of efficiency yet. However, if recent trends continue, I thin we will reach it some time soon even if we are not there yet. And when we do--and well after--the cultural aversion to ""freeloading"" will persist even though it is less and less needed. Which is unfortunate.",1327131493

Out of the pool of possible cases that they could bring to trial, they only bring a fraction of those to trial. But the ones that they do bring are the ones that they feel they are more likely to win.<p>The reason that they can win or settle so many of their cases isn't their extra resources (which can be vast). It's that they are selective in the cases they choose. This ends up being self-reinforcing too - the more cases that they settle, the more the reputation that they have a strong case, which increases the likelihood that the next case will settle.<p>Their extra resources come into play when evaluating a single case, but when looking at the population of possible cases, it is their selectivity that skews the percentages in their favor.",1327131123

Have you even contemplated all the things the industry youre trying to kill does?<p>Make note of something: Hollywood is one of the most unionized workforces in the United States.   This isnt a story of rich studio heads taking advantage of people.  Actors, Writers, Stage Hands, Directors, and just about everyone else in Hollywood is in a union of some kind and theres a reason for that.<p>Creativity is random and creative people cant count on steady work.  So they need equitable pay to survive.<p>Theres an organization called Chanel 101 in LA.  Its basically a bunch of creative people showing their work (they put the stuff online if you want to google it).  What the great majority of these people have in common is they work in the industry.  Not as actors or writers but as stagehands, clerks and other low level positions.  They are the people fighting their way up through the system and the system is designed to support them while they do.  \nThe system youre trying to kill is what keeps those people alive.  What puts food on their table so they can keep working towards their dreams.  Because they arent programmers.  They cant go out and get an $85,000 a year day job that allows them to live comfortably while they tinker on a startup in their spare time.<p>The studio system, as obnoxious as it is, exists for a reason.  Its an equilibrium thats developed over decades of creating media.  Every few years youll see a famous actor form their own studio yet those studios always end up playing by the same rules as the existing studios.  Because its still roughly the most equitable system available (and if you dont believe that you should feel free to try and start your own studio)<p>Yes, the media industry can help to create stupid laws.  I dont deny that.  But it isnt because theyre evil or mean.  For the most part its because these companies are run by 60 year old men who dont understand the nuances of technology.   But their intentions are good.  Their intention is to keep money on the table of all those creative people.  To keep paying residuals to actors who might not find work for years at a time.  To keep funding movies where theres no guarantee of profit and keep all those stagehands, clerks, and so on employed.<p>It is quite frankly unconscionable for a millionaire to lead a bunch of people who can make over $100,000 a year in an effort to kill off the industry thats paying all the folks who make less than $30,000.<p>(Let the down votes commence)",1327130395

I can get a server with 30 TB of monthly data transfer for $40 a month. That's 75 cents a terabyte, or 0.3 cents per full length movie.

To date the pattern is repeating itself. App Stores and streaming services are take huge cuts from creators of content.

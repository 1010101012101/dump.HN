In the Mac version of Safari you can to to Preferences-Advanced and tell Safari to ""Never use font sizes smaller than X.""  And in OSX's System Preferences you can go to ""Appearance"" and tell OSX to ""Turn off text smoothing for font sizes X and smaller.""  Good luck!",1181593548

27322,comment,27297,27297,0,0,tx,,,"+1. Thank you for the link. Currently I use my rare visits to  the Apple store to test our pages on Safari :-) Besides, it is truly a speedy browser, especially when connection is good.<p>Their page, however, along with their benchmarks is very misleading. It is widely known that IE starts almost instantly because of of the DLLs it uses have already been preloaded by Windows apps (regular file explorer in particular).<p>Also their JavaScript performance of IE7 is also a suspect. In my own use (not scientific in any way) IE7 outperformed FireFox by 30% but I was using alot of regular expressions so it was mostly regex performance rather than pure JS execution speed.<p>",1181592760

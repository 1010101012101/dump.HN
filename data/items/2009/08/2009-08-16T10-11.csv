Western Heights College in Geelong, Australia has a student population of around half of Caltech's.<p>This has made major headlines in the Australian press and has raised concerns about the education systems ability to deal with student depression and the effects of it. Copy cat behaviour has been suggested also.<p>Unfortunately, apart from the obvious grief the students have experienced, they have also had to put up with TV crews trying to enter the school and taking every opportunity to speak with students who are quite likely not equipped to deal with the difficult circumstances they are faced with.",1250419839

They were highly functional, rather pedagogically rigourous (compared to American daycare / kindergarten), and kept your children from about 8 AM until about 7 PM.  You could start sending your children there at about 2 1/2 and it was provided free by the state.  Very convenient and good for all.<p>EDIT: Some of the most enjoyable moments of my entire life played out there.  And I only went until I was 6 1/2 and we left for the US.  Now I'm 23.  So, the fact that I still remember them should tell the reader something;  they were anything but drab in the way that Soviet institutions are sometimes imagined to be.",1250419792

You can look at Postgres' Viel project or Oracle's VPDB functionality to see record and column level fine-grained authorization. My system implements a flat RBAC system in Lisp and I will be implementing OAuth as the inter-app authentication module.

765949,story,,,3,8,Ghassan,"Erlang functional language supports concurrency inherently and seamlessly",,"I am baffeled by Erlang, a functional programming language that inherently supports concurrency. This is a language that has been out since 1992 by Ericson and Swedish CS labs but only recently is getting some attention. 
This shows two problems:
1.	That despite this has been long needed, since multicores were out, but we did not know about it until recently. And still largely in the dark compared with other popular languages.
2.	This draws us to more pressing question: how many technologies out there, are still under publicized, eagerly needed, can be true economic drivers, and still obscure?
3.	We can not revive the economy or create a better world unless we truly think outside the box and get VC support properly",1250419189

I doubt it's an efficiently designed mechanism to keep the costs even.<p>There's always some limit to how much we'll spend trying to prevent things from happening. For instance, you could tie people together in groups of 3 to reduce the successful suicide rate. I think most people would rather allow some suicides than take 2 people to the bathroom with them, or for that matter, getting dragged into monitor 2 others' trips to the bathroom.<p>You could also argue whether all suicides cost society.",1250418788

Go talk to people and discover that other people have the same problem(s) and their solutions suck compared to mine. Discover there is tremendous need (demand) and some folks are strongly interested in what I do.  Spend a lot of time helping people for free.  Get burned out on that and on being so freakin' controversial.  Take about 2 years off from that while I get myself well and also try to figure out how to package threatening/controversial information so it's palatable -- so it's taken as an opportunity instead of a criticism/personal attack.  Work on figuring out how to monetize it without killing it because you can't pay someone to care about your welfare.  Either they do or they don't.  Realize that the only effective way to commodify what I do is to uncouple the income stream and the output stream -- ie not charge directly for the thing people really want/need from me.  Currently pursuing those efforts as a ""hobby"" and working on monetizing it.<p>Not exactly a get-rich-quick scheme.  But that's roughly the process I have been going through.",1250417338

I'd like to have a part of my library on the macbook (including stuff I listen to regularly, podcasts etc.) and a second part (my lib is around 200G) on an external HDD or AFP mount. At the moment I can only do that if I don't have iTunes manage my lib and then, still, the handling of missing files isn't too great.<p>IMO they should also get serious about supporting movies (as in: .avi, .mkv) - I'd love to use iTunes for that and helper apps demonstrate how much can be done here (epg guides etc.). Again, that'd require splitting my lib over various USB and AFP drives.<p>I really think there is demand for a well-made iTunes clone on the Mac, as long as it avoid feature creep: player software should manage and play music, I'll take care of getting it - keep your BitTorrent portal stuff to yourself, thank you.",1250416822

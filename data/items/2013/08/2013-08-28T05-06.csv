6288225,comment,6284329,6285751,3,0,neya,,,"I agree with everything you say. I think functional vs imperative is a matter of taste, though. Even I tend to incline towards Functional Programming (FP) in most scenarios, but in some cases imperative languages are &#x27;good enough&#x27;.<p>And since my background used to be client-side Javascript mainly (I was a front-end designer), I find it fairly confusing to switch myself between the two mindsets (FP and IP), which like you said is something more of a personal preference.<p>And like I said, I still love Scala, for the reasons you&#x27;ve cited. But then again, there are a couple of reasons which I have in mind for going with Go.<p>The main problem with Scala for me:<p>1) Difficult to find good Scala engineers. IF you find one, you still need to figure out if he&#x27;s comfortable with the Functional or Imperative model.<p>2) Syntax:<p>This is an example from one of my previous commenters (dxbydt, thank you) on my thread:<p><pre><code>    scala> def test1 = println (&quot;hello world&quot;)
    scala> def test2(f: =>Unit) = println (&quot;hello world&quot;)
    scala> def test3(f:Unit) = println (&quot;hello world&quot;)
    scala> test1
    hello world
    scala> test2()
    hello world
    scala> test3()
    hello world
    scala> val t = test2 _
    scala> t apply Unit
    hello world
    scala> t()
    hello world
    scala> t(())
    hello world
</code></pre>
It is mostly a personal preference, but I still feel too many ways to do one thing is a recipe for disaster.<p>With all that said, I know of people writing a Scala program and not touching it for a year or two unless they wanted to update their OS on their servers.",1377669049

Realistically chemical weapons don&#x27;t tip the balance scales very much in the realm of America&#x27;s narrow/selfish geopolitical interests, in the interests of humaneness, or in the more broad interests of attempting to do whatever is best for the people of the region on a long-term basis (specifically in regards to peaceful co-existence and consensual governance).<p>We&#x27;ve attempted low touch &quot;tomahawk diplomacy&quot; before. We bombed Saddam&#x27;s Iraq for their intransigence and aggression in the late &#x27;90s, we bombed Afghanistan and the Suddan in 1998 in retaliation for the bombings of our embassies, and so on. For the most part such things are utter wastes of effort.<p>Retaliatory strikes are almost always bullshit. &quot;Proportionate response&quot; is just a fancy word for retaliation or revenge. Low touch warfare is almost always a mistake (see also: drone campaigns). We need to have clear geopolitical objectives, we need to be even clearer how we plan to achieve those objectives, and we need to follow through with as much effort (in whatever form) is required to achieve those objectives. Anything else is like some sort of macabre lottery. Attempting to see if killing a few people will magically result in a desired outcome even though the chances are low.<p>Granted, one should be under no illusions, there are some very serious &quot;bad guys&quot; in the region, and in Syria specifically. Bad guys who few people on Earth should object to being killed. However, the situation is also much more complex than that and it&#x27;s never the case that military action only kills or injures the exact people you want and no one else. There is a 3 (ish) side sectarian war in progress in Syria which has now spread to Lebanon. Taking out the al-Assad regime could perhaps be a good thing but it won&#x27;t bring an end to the sectarian war. Whether or not chemical weapons are used as long as that war continues tens of thousands of people are going to be killed each year it goes on, if not more. I don&#x27;t think the Obama administration has a very strong understanding of the complex dynamics on the ground in Syria nor do they have a firm plan on how to end the war there. Moreover, I think the lessons the administration has taken from what happened in Libya (even taking into account the later attack on the US embassy) are likely to lead them to believe that the situation is far less complex than it actually is.",1377666936

The 4-finger squeeze to get back to the springboard is a disaster since it just slows down the animation and you can see the horrible aliasing of the icons. The 4-finger swipe up no longer makes any sense either: it perviously slid up the screen to reveal the task tray, which is a logical direct manipulation, and now it jumps to the new task view. There is no longer a sense that your fingers are manipulating anything, it&#x27;s a meaningless gesture slash macro holdover from iOS 6 that needs to be re-thought.<p>On my iPad mini there is also a noticable lag when you slide up the control panel and slide down the notification panel, particularly on the first swipe. And swiping down on the springboard to reveal search drops a few frames too so it&#x27;s a jerky jump at the end of the animation. And god damn, I wish they would just make it so you can swipe the lock screen in either direction to unlock, the number of times I&#x27;ve swiped the wrong way (since there is no longer a button to slide) is crazy and pointless.<p>I guess I should file some radars or look these up :)",1377666785

6288140,comment,6285426,6286645,5,0,kyzyl,,,"FWIW, we certainly can make synchronized tandem lifts, but as always it comes down to costs. Basically if you want both actuators to move in unison, you either need to directly link them mechanically, which is expensive to build/repair, and not very feasible over large distances, or you need to connect them electrically via their control signals.<p>In the latter case, you would usually synchronize their controller clocks, and specify the motors/cylinders/whatever to both have a very tight positioning tolerance. Then you mount the surface being moved on a system of bearings that have enough freedom s.t. it will self center automatically, absorbing the tiny bit of misalignment that can (and WILL) occur.<p>However, in my experience it&#x27;s almost always better to use two passive, i.e. non-lifting, supports along with one actuator in the middle that is twice as powerful. In heavy lift applications it often comes down to getting a single cylinder that is powerful enough without blowing the cost through the roof. Nevertheless, if you look at marine architecture, airport gangways, earth moving machinery etc. you will often see just a single lifting point.<p>And in three paragraphs we&#x27;ve gone from office chair pistons to front-end loaders!

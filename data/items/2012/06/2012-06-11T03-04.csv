That's the lowest level since at least 1972. And well below the 25.6% companies paid on average from 1987 to 2008."" [1]<p>So I would argue that the title of the article is false, and in aggregate US corporations <i>have</i> engineered around taxes. Alternatively, you could say that they haven't engineered around anything, and the system is operating as designed, it's just that you can't characterize its behavior by a single number.<p>EDIT: To make the point more explicit, OP says the US is losing business to China because of China's 15% corporate tax rate, and yet that rate is higher than the effective tax rate in the US. Perhaps there's an argument to be made that US taxes really are higher, but the evidence cited in this article isn't it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204662204577199492233215330.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405297020466220457719...</a>",1339385134

Six figures in Denver can go pretty far (owning a nice house or downtown apartment, vacations, private schools if you've got kids), whereas six figures in San Francisco almost certainly won't buy you that. I'm intentionally limiting this to San Francisco because, just as you can get more for your dollar by exploring the Bay Area and commuting, you can also get more for your dollar around Denver by living in some of the less affluent areas (e.g. Aurora, Erie) further out. Denver's got enough of a tech scene to support salaries in that range without fuss or lack of interesting work, so you're not harming your career prospects by moving here.<p>Denver's also got many other qualities worth mentioning. There's great weather and a laid back culture that is surprising given that many in Denver identify as ""Midwesterners"" - a term I associate with negative qualities that I've not found here. The populace is very educated, there's plenty of good beer to be had, if you're interested in such activity the mountains are a short drive away, and if you want to travel there's a national hub just east of the city. Boulder's close if a college-town atmosphere is more your scene, but Denver is a large enough area that you're not necessarily tied to what that atmosphere brings in the same way you might be in other towns (e.g. Charlottesville, VA). There's a decent public transportation system, relatively light traffic if you must drive somewhere, good food - it's got quite a lot to offer.<p>Really, there are only two things I dislike about living in Denver in particular: curiously small yards and the lack of easy access to the ocean. That said, the pros vastly outweigh the cons, and until I leave the country, Denver's where I plan to stay.",1339385087

The one on the right is better designed and it is instantly obvious what it is supposed to do and how it works. It makes shopping lists from recipes. It's got actual lists rather than latin and has a useful delete button for ingredients you already have.<p>So it seems clear the other guys were able to come up with a better UI on their own than with the UI specialist. Yeah, sucks, but dumping that guy was probably the right decision.<p>Looking at the other guy's completed working site at sautenow.com, it looks awesome and the interaction design is smooth and intuitive. The graphic design is excellent.<p>The whiteboard storyboard/workflow doesn't look all the same. It seems to have a popup menu for selecting meals? Hard to say what the long box/small box means, seems to be a popup. Very different from what they went with on their site.<p>As far as the basic idea of adding recipes to a recipe box or shopping list and then getting a list of ingredients and what recipes each is used in, allrecipes.com does that, as do at least a dozen other similar sites which have been around for many years.",1339384044

The examples provided all were projects with widespread approval. But today, there isn't a lot of agreement. It will take more visionary politicians than what we have today to convince people their policy is the policy to follow. Yesterday, we had politicians that envisioned a future where Americans could drive across the country or put a man on the Moon. Today, what?",1339384041

I suggest you try doing it for someone else's work. Try signing up to be an editor at one of the story-writing sites.

Essentially every plank in the Socialist Party Platform of 1928 has already been enacted into law. Nowadays many of the issues government tries to address were <i>caused</i> by the <i>previous</i> round of government efforts to solve problems.<p>But the longer you apply patches on top of patches, the more rickety the whole structure becomes. Eventually you reach a point where you'd be better starting over with a complete rewrite from scratch. It happens for software languages and OSes; it happens for governments too.<p>As for what to do about it, I always liked Heinlein's suggestion (in The Moon is a Harsh Mistress) that there should two houses of congress: one whose job is to pass new laws, another whose job is to repeal old ones. Without that second house, the legal code invariably becomes a cancer or an impenetrable thicket.<p>Another idea is Seasteading. Basically there needs to be <i>some</i> way that brand new from-scratch ideas of how to govern can be tried out and demonstrated. The same way stodgy old companies can learn by stealing ideas (and people) from tiny new startup companies, the stodgy old governments need a way to learn by stealing ideas from tiny new startup governments. Any change that helps big old countries break up into smaller new ones or allows brand new smaller ones to come into existence would be a big help. Seasteading (forming new societies in international waters) is one such option; another is the ""charter cities"" movement, where existing governments are convinced to voluntarily allow other legal systems to flourish in small areas that would otherwise be in their domain.",1339383631

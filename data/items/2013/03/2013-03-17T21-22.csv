We don't need martian resources (other than the space) and anything else is a souvenir. People had to go and come back from the Americas because of the lack of video (no other way to see it) and because we wanted something the Americas had (gold, wood, coal, cotton etc).<p>We went to the Moon a few times, but it didn't have very much of anything we needed.

5391241,comment,5390937,5390937,5,0,justinsb,,,"I think both experiments are consistent with the idea of thinking of the different Google properties as individual apps, and with Chrome apps becoming first-class apps.<p>Thus on ChromeOS you would access gmail through the menu of applications (not by going to google.com and clicking on the mail link on top).  If I click on the Gmail ""app"" on ChromeOS it's confusing if the top navbar appears, because then there are two ways to launch other apps.<p>The second experiment seems to be experimenting with exposing non-ChromeOS people to this notion (i.e. get everyone used to the app menu, so that it feels natural when they get ChromeOS).<p>It would be possible to do this by e.g. hiding the navbar only on ChromeOS; my guess is the idea is to have a consistent experience across all browsers.  If you're stuck inside IE on Windows the app menu is embedded into the google page.  If you're on the ""brave new world"" of ChromeOS the app menu is native.  But if the navbar isn't there on ChromeOS, then it can't be there on IE.",1363557311

If savers decided to hoard farm land...then farm produce would go up. Bakeries...same effect. Note I'm not arguing against investment but there is a difference between investment and saving. Saving is trying to maintain purchasing power that you have earned today and want to spend in the future. Investment is the deployment of your capital at some risk in order to possibly earn a return. Your prescriptions are all investments. I'm not a skilled businessman/investor - I'm a coder that just wants to defer my purchasing power that I earned today\n.\nWhat the savers currently do is hoard currency. The thirst for currency encourages and enables large amounts of debt to be written (as debt is the largest producer of currency via bank loans) which leads to cheap credit which leads to malinvestment.<p>In my comment history you will see a rather long entry I reposted from ZeroHedge.

In the US for equities, there is a national best bid and offer which means that the prices stay in line.  (Also see: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_best_bid_and_offer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_best_bid_and_offer</a>)<p>If someone in the US first wants to sell a stock for as low as $95 (places a resting ask order at $95), and then someone else comes in and is willing to buy the stock for up to $105 (places a bid at $105), their orders will match, and the transaction will occur at $95.  They won't just sit around waiting for some arbitrageur to come around.<p>Let's say there is an arbitrage between an index fund etf and its component companies such that you can buy all the components for $99, and sell the etf for $100.  In this case who is the poor real market participant who gets screwed by the arbitraguer?  If the ""real market participant"" got his order filled, he will be happy.<p>""Today the number of market participants & electronic transactions make trades near perfect; The utility of arbitrage trades vanished almost completely.""<p>I think you are confusing cause and effect.  The reason why the markets are indeed much more efficient these days is because of the existants of many more people engaged in arbitrage.  This is something you should be happy about.

Here is one that attempts to, while not duplicating what's already been said.<p>It's been said already that on Plan 9 you've got the same interface to local and remote resources.  That's cool and all, but how many computers have you got, really?  And how many of them run Plan 9?<p>So here's a related example, a corollary almost, of local vs remote.<p>You see, it isn't just local vs remote, it's also in-kernel vs user-mode.  On most systems, you make system calls to ask the kernel to do something for you, and you make library calls to access functionality that's been implemented in user-mode.<p>In Plan 9, you've got some system and library calls, but for most services you've got the same interface whether they're in the kernel or in user-mode.  REgardless of what language they're implemented in, too.<p>In the 90's, Plan 9's networking interface was a user-mode filesystem written in Alef.  The IP stack was, the hardware drivers were in the kernel though.<p>In 2000 or so it was all moved into the kernel (except the connection server).  But it was still a filesystem.  The same interface.   A service was moved from userspace to the kernel, and the method of accessing it didn't change, so no programs had to be changed, or even relinked or recompiled.<p>I mentioned the connection server (cs).  You wanna know about the cs?  Basically, it's a program that understands network types FOR YOU, so you don't have to.  You _could_ access the network without cs, but the feel would basically be the same as using sockets:  you would have to know whether you're connecting to TCP, UDP, or other, and make different calls accordingly; you would have to know whether your user has passed you a DNS name or an IP address; etc.  With cs, you ask cs to do it, and nicely receive a file descriptor to the correct type of network.<p>That IPv6 support was added without changing any programs is due to cs.  This sounds similar to the other example, but it's different.  In the first example, the implementation changed but the _types_ of networks supported remained constant.  The Blue Gene has all sorts of esoteric networks not used anywhere else.  Only thing that had to be done to Plan 9 was write the hardware drivers and teach cs the new networks.<p>If I could make this post shorter and still have all the same information, I would, honestly.  But I could talk for hours about Plan 9.<p>Plan 9 is basically a redesign where your files and username/password are centralised like on a Unix network with dumb terminals (70s up to mid 80s Unix), but at the same time, you're able to make use of the local resources of your ""terminal"" like use the CD driver or a scanner or whatever.  You have access to them as if you're root.<p>Plan 9 says:  whoever turns the machine on is basically root.  If you have physical access to the box, you could theoretically fuck it up any way you wanted, so we might as well just give you root - there's nothing valuable (security wise) on a terminal anyway.  Enjoy your CD drive.<p>The paragraph before the last one is more important than you think.  You see, all that other stuff I said about /net, that came afterwards.  The original goal was just to have centralised auth and (disk) fs, and stateless terminals.  But then, all that other stuff we have in Plan 9 (e.g. network transparency, no real superuser) sort of emerged as a corollary of that first goal.<p>Other things that Plan 9 users are obsessed with (e.g. mouse chording, output which is usable as input, etc) more fall under the category of things with would be equally easy or difficult to implement regardless of the underlying OS.<p>I'm really glad we've got all these nice things under one OS, because it's totally conceivable that someone could have designed an OS where (say) everything is a file, but doesn't have (say) clean readable code.  We have both, but we also have relaxing colours, mouse chording, easy-to-use concurrency, and a cool mascot.",1363555784

5391110,comment,5390726,5390726,32,0,davmre,,,"As an ML researcher, this article isn't persuasive to me for a few reasons:<p>- Computing power is getting exponentially cheaper even as computing requirements increase. The resources available to a university lab in the future will be much greater than those available today, even given the same budget. Of course this is also true for industry, but this growth is not a unique advantage of industry.<p>- Other scientific fields already have equipment costs that are orders of magnitude larger than CS. Physicists regularly write grant proposals for multimillion-dollar pieces of equipment. If building large clusters is necessary for academic research to stay relevant, academics will start building large clusters. The foundational work done at Bell, IBM, Xerox, etc in the 70s and 80s was not due to resource constraints in academia (academics had expensive computers too, and also did plenty of good work during that time), it was because those companies had the right combination of smart people and an immediate need to find practical solutions to difficult problems.<p>- Finally, and most importantly, <i>even in the age of big data</i> almost all fundamental research can be done quite successfully at small scales with modest hardware requirements. Notice that Hinton et. al. have spent 6+ years developing deep learning <i>in academia</i>, and it's only in the past couple of years that it's matured to the point of implementation at scale.<p>Here's the basic pipeline of most machine learning research: you come up with a new approach for training SVMs, or multilayer perceptrons, or some new type of more interesting model. First you develop your ideas conceptually, with some equations on a whiteboard. If you're a theorist, you might prove some theorems. Next you write a toy implementation in Matlab or Python to show that your method actually works, and that you get improvement over previous work <i>for the dataset size you're using</i>. This could mean that your method is faster -- which indicates it'll be able to scale to bigger data -- or that it's smarter / taking advantage of some new type of structure, in which case it still ought to get decent (if not state-of-the-art) results on small data. <i>Only then</i>, usually after publishing a few papers and working out the kinks, does it generally make sense to put in the effort to implement and test a big, efficient distributed version of your algorithm. And while that last part might be best done by industry, the first few steps are easily possible in academia and will continue to be for the foreseeable future.<p>Case in point: Google Translate is a massive system whose performance rests squarely on exploiting big data, in that they use the Internet as their training set. But academic machine translation research still runs quite effectively with smaller datasets on small clusters. The academics come up with ideas, implement and test them, and some ideas flop while others take off. The idea that take off get picked up by Google and implemented into Translate, where they hopefully end up pushing the envelope. So even though the academics don't have the resources to work at massive scale (which most of them don't want to do anyway -- ML researchers are usually more interested in ML than in building distributed systems) their research still has impact, through transfer to industry. This sort of relationship has been the model for academic/industry research collaboration for quite a while, and I don't think it's dead yet.",1363555314

It was essentially free infrastructure and storage for an ecosystem of apps that generated more value (both financial and intangible) than the product itself.""<p>That's not what I see at all.<p>From day 1 when I switched from ""feedonfeeds"" which is basically a self hosted simple web based reader to using Reader many years ago, I always thought the purpose of Reader was for the mighty GOOG to associate my gmail address and web search history and all that stuff with a list of sites I follow so as to sell better advertising.  And better spamming of other people with similar interests.  So someone reading aaronsons quantum physics blog might get ammo spam because I (and probably many others) read both aaronsons and esr's blog.<p>The true meaning of the abandonment of RSS by GOOG is they're shrinking their ""big data"" source collection, not growing it, maybe for the first time ever.  They've grown their data gathering for so many years, weird stuff like streetview vans gathering wifi SSIDs, over 100 spam emails per day for me even when I no longer use email as a major communications tool, etc.  But now they're in a pruning mode, gathering less data not more.  That inflection point is the ""REAL"" story.  Maybe eventually they'll inevitably roll back to just spidering the net for search.  Or they'll give up on all the ""big data"" stuff and pivot 100% into phones.  Could happen?<p>Another interpretation is reader was for infovores or whatever I am.  People who think learning about the world is watching Laverne and Shirly reruns on old fashioned broadcast TV are very profitable to advertise to, but they don't/didn't use Reader.  And people like me use adblock.  So I'm not very profitable for GOOG.  For example, people who won't see our ads, do read both aaronsons blog and esrs blog which is kinda interesting, but who cares, they adblock anyway so no way to spam them.  Its more profitable to track and spam the old fashioned TV watchers.",1363554728

He came under extremely heavy German machine gun and mortar fire and was forced to advance through a minefield to get his men to cover. In the process, he stepped on a mine and was severely wounded, losing his leg. Their mission being vital, he ordered his men to leave him and find that crossing, which they did. Although they sent a medic to recover their officer, upon finding him the medic refused to give him morphine, saying that he didn’t have enough to waste on a man who would die in a few minutes anyway. He was then abandoned and listed as dead.<p>Some time later, a Red Cross doughnut wagon happened by. One of the two person crew noticed Kenny laying unconscious in the minefield and went to check if he was alive. Finding a pulse, they brought him to the doughnut wagon, which was cleared out and converted to an emergency operating room. These two Red Cross canteen workers performed major surgery on the spot and saved his life at the risk of their own.<p>What’s a few cents for doughnuts compared to that?""",1363554554

5391050,comment,5390834,5391037,13,0,derefr,,,"Maybe technically. For me the difference is much more practical: with RSS, I can subscribe to something that updates once every five months, and <i>not miss that update</i>, because it ends up as an unread item in my inbox forevermore. With Twitter (or Facebook, Tumblr, or any other ""activity feed"" site), by the time I check, that one update has long been washed away by the stream of more frequent updates from other things.<p>You'll notice, though, that there <i>is</i> one other thing that already manages this perfectly: <i>email newsletter subscription</i>. RSS at this point could really just be made into a microformat on top of email--presumably, just a specific additional MIME-type for messages--and then an RSS ""client"" would just be a special email client that gives you an alternate view of your own email account's inbox, only showing messages that have a representation in that MIME-type available, and laying them out in the traditional ""river of news + passing an item marks it as read"" style. And there would be literally no difference experience-wise!<p>It could even be set up on top of your <i>Gmail</i> inbox, which feels justly spiteful somehow. :)<p>Now, obviously, not everybody wants to set up their own Sendgrid account or something just to allow RSS subscriptions. Regular ""XML file on a webserver"" RSS could still exist as the lazy producer-side method, while still changing the consumer-side entirely into something SMTP+MIME-based. PubSubHubbub gateways (like Superfeedr) are already doing something equivalent in cost to sending out email; it would just be a matter of convincing them to add an additional subscription option.<p>Also, the fact that RSS items would be served with an ""additional"" MIME-type is important: if all these messages also had a regular text/plain or text/html representation, then looking at your email inbox with a regular mail reader would still show you all the same messages (though they could obviously be filtered away from your inbox into a ""Subscriptions"" tag if you so preferred.) What was starred in your RSS reader would be starred in your email client. To share an RSS item with a friend, you'd just forward it (and then they'd see it in <i>their</i> RSS client, since the forwarded message ended up in their email inbox!) You'd never lose anything as long as you had an IMAP client to sync it with. Et cetera.<p>In effect, RSS would no longer be its own special domain, only exposed through special tools; it would ""just"" be email. And more interestingly, vice-versa! Any message that wanted to (I'm thinking ""lifecycle emails"" or newsletters) could add an RSS MIME representation, and it would start showing up in your RSS client just like anything you had subscribed to through one of the PuSH gateways. ""Email newsletter"" would, in fact, become <i>unified as a concept</i> with ""RSS."" If we're all being called-to-arms to get down to hacking on something, why not set this up instead of just writing a thousand crappy new RSS readers? ;)<p>---<p>P.S.

That, I think, was the biggest thing.<p>I also gave the first several thousand members - who had already become the most vocal and most dedicated members - a chance to earn a free lifetime membership if they completed certain goals that would help me to test the site's functionality. Things like sending ten private messages, making ten forum posts, things like that.<p>The business wasn't a smashing success, but this part of it was, I think. Some members left once we went for-pay because they simply weren't willing to pay for things online, basically. However, there was no rancor or anything.",1363554000

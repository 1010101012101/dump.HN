That's interesting and inspiring, but what really amazes me is that Bob didn't know how to use a computer, he spent a couple hours on the phone, and then never had to call back again.<p>If that's true, you know what it tells me? This was incredibly well designed software. The reason Ron got $4 million dollars wasn't because he spent time on the phone with Bob. It's because he had great software that worked and that a complete novice, with a little help, could configure and run. What large company wouldn't want software like that?<p>Yes, customer service is important, but having a great product that's easy to use is the really big lesson here.",1339167566

You can't just pull two commercial products off the shelf and then pretend you're examining the impact of only one of the hundered different things that differs between the two.<p>Similarly, if we wanted to compare the impact of dynamic vs. static typing, we'd have to make sure that that is the <i>only</i> variable.  Which means you basically have to construct a new programming language from the ground up, so that you can easily create new dialects of it that differ in only one very specific characteristic.",1339167540

Many drivers tend to forget that the fastest you can ever drive, anywhere, is as fast as is responsible. Even on German autobahns with no speed limit, you can get a steep ticket for going too fast - this is at the discretion of a police officer and ultimately the courts. Automated LE wipes out that discretion in favour of determinism.<p>> As long as the process is transparent (i.e. everyone knows about it and the algorithms are open source) I don't see a problem with that at all.<p>Well, you have near perfect empirical evidence to expect that won't be the case.",1339167360

At the same time some static type systems are restrictive while coding, so you're seeing more and more type inference in languages.<p>Go does it by allowing one to declare a variable with an expression "" a := 1"".<p>C++ 2011 has it with ""auto""<p>Haskell is pretty darned good at it, and a lot of people don't write the types of their functions, though I think it's good practice to make sure you and the compiler agree on what you've written.<p>That said there's languages like Clojure which are dynamically typed in a sense, and I believe pay a slight performance penalty because they have to use reflection to behave that way.  There's ways to annotate types in Clojure to get around that.  This is an interesting case because Lisp is typically a dynamically typed language.<p>At the same time there's awesome languages and environments like Racket that have statically typed and dynamically typed versions of their scheme dialects.<p>My feeling is that a ruling on whether types are useful or not is sort of a pointless discussion.  It's not even true that ""the jury is out"". You're just choosing tools with different properties and some make sense for some situations and others for others.",1339167347

But even if it's just about finding the reason of a geometric suite or calculating the derivative of some function, the teaching process is the same as in the Jamie example:<p><pre><code>    step 1: those are the Rules and Theorems.
    step 2: IF $situation THEN apply $rule42
    step 3: solved!
</code></pre>
Basically this is about the same as someone telling you that when you encounter screws you need to use a screwdriver. Thus the whole teaching of basic mathematics currently is akin to learning to build all Ikea furniture directions by rote and expecting people to get something out of it that would propel them to carpenter level.<p>Math is not about driving screws with the screwdriver given to you, it's about understanding what a screwdriver is made of, why it is shaped this way, and building your own appropriate screwdriver should you encounter an unknown screw.<p>The current system is so hopelessly wrong that when I was faced with it my personal solution was to solve stuff in the quickest way possible so that I'm not bothered with such crap anymore. Incidentally to achieve this I taught myself to truly understand mathematics. The majority of others though could not be bothered and simply learned the rules by rote, because it was so complicated (and of course it is if you understand zilch about what you're doing). The irony is that the whole teaching process ended up this way because some people up above deemed mathematics too hard and ""simplified"" teaching. Then the whole thing got out of hand in a self-sustaining loop.",1339166813

The only difference is that one forces you to declare variable types, and checks them at compile time rather than at run time.<p>They take 49 students and train them in the language - 16 hours for the dynamic version, 18 for the static, because of ""the additional effort for teaching the static type system"". The students have 27 hours to complete two related tasks. All activity was logged, so they could look at the time from a test run failing with type errors to a successful test run.<p>- Scanner task: overall, students using the dynamically typed language were significantly quicker to complete a scanner that passed the tests - on average, about a third faster. Within that, the time spent debugging type errors doesn't differ between the groups.<p>- Parser task (builds on the scanner): The implementations are tested after coding has finished, showing no significant difference in success between the languages.

When she asked the same questions of students being taught the traditional way, they would generally tell them what page of the book they were on. When she asked them, ""But what are you actually doing?"" they would answer ""Oh, I'm doing number 3."" [p.98]<p>The typical math education relies a lot on rote learning (just take a look at the cheatsheets here: <a href=""http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/cheat_table.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/cheat_table.aspx</a>). There are a lot of equations you just have to remember by heart to be able to be productive in solving the typical textbook problems. For a high-school student who does not have any insight on the beauty of mathematics, this is a huge turn off. They leave school with the impression that this is a cold hard subject with perfect proofs that you have to learn by rote, and nothing more. No one talks about why Math is beautiful. The most positive thing about Math I've heard from people is that it is the best subject to get a perfect score. The arts are subjective and there is no perfectly right answer, but Math, if you know how to solve these types of problems without missing a sign or a bracket here or there, you get a 100/100.<p>The problem, I think, is because we teach the results of hundreds of years of evolution of Maths. For example, most courses on Calculus start teaching it by talking about Limits, and from there moves onto Differentiation. Integration is considered to be the 'advanced' part of Calculus. It was very recently that I discovered Apostle's textbook on Calculus (students of universities who use that text are lucky) where he treats Integration first - because that is the right historical order in which Calculus evolved.<p>I could appreciate it a lot more when I understood what kind of problems were Newton and Leibniz trying to solve when they came up with the formalized notion of Calculus. Calculus was described by them using the concept of 'infinitesimals', not through Limits. Limits was a clever abstraction that was evolved later to better explain Calculus and keep it consistent. But when we start teaching students Calculus with Limits, show them the perfect way where Limits can be used to find the differentials of trigonometric functions, they do not know this background. For them, there is no moment of 'awe'. They are not even shown a glimpse of the amazing intellectual pursuit that was behind this fantastic subject. All you see are a bunch of equations, some proofs that are mathematically perfect, and you just learn them by rote.<p>The typical Math education needs to focus more on the evolution of the subject, the pains faced by mathematicians (or physicists!) to which they came up with these solutions. The logical gaps in new ideas and how they were filled later. Let the students understand that this is not a 'perfect' subject. There were  human beings who faced real problems who came up with these solutions. Even better, let them understand that some of the things they learn was the result an intellectual pastime for these mathematicians. It was imperfect, and there was joy when mathematicians brought it closer to perfection.<p>With the advent of computers, most of the evaluation criteria used in High School Math is becoming redundant. Moving from one step to another without making careless mistakes is priority number one now. If we reduce the importance on that manual aspect of the typical Math problem solving, and instead focus on teaching the more  interesting, insightful things about Math, the students will go away with a totally different idea about Maths. Like programming, it becomes a universe of abstractions where your curiosity drives you to learn more.",1339164381

4084191,comment,4083998,4083998,0,0,tomkin,,,"> Numerous studies over the past thirty years have shown that when people of any age and any ability level are faced with mathematical challenges that arise naturally in a real-world context that has meaning for them, and where the outcome directly matters to them, they rapidly achieve a high level of competence. How high? Typically 98 percent, that's how high. I describe some of those studies in my book The Math Gene (Basic Books, 2000). I also provide an explanation of why those same people, when presented with the very same mathematical challenges in a traditional paper-and-pencil classroom fashion, perform at a lowly 37 percent level.<p>This. I love that this argument is being made. There is this notion among academics that the student should bend to the (fabricated?) stringent regulations on how math is taught or expressed. As a society, we accept the fact that there are those who grasp concepts, learn and develop sensibilities of material in various different ways.<p>For me personally, I found the way that math was taught in school to be completely disconnected with its purpose. There would be times where material was applied, but more often not. No other subject can get away with this. Music - instruments, scale and training. Art - painting, modelling and theory. English – writing, reading & comprehension. Science - hypothesis, experiments, conclusion. Most subjects have an <i>execution</i> factor. How far Jamie has to walk to get 3 bags of milk is <i>not</i> execution, it's <i>practise</i>. This is a gross simplification of a beautiful subject - but this is the point where many get lost: Purpose.<p>For those who absorb material differently, this is where the conversation needs to start.",1339164228

4084178,story,,,1,0,nathanfield,"The Virtues of a Low(er) Tech Future in Egypt",http://www.arabist.net/blog/2012/6/6/the-virtues-of-a-lower-tech-future-in-egypt.html,"The Virtues of a Low(er) Tech Future in Egypt<p>Theres a growing school of thought that promotion of entrepreneurship is an effective solution to the socio-economic problems facing many Arab countries, especially Egypt. In Jobs@Arabia.com Thomas Friedman heaped praise on Oassis500, a high-tech accelerator in Jordan that provides startup money and training to budding internet companies.  A prominent American investor recently profiled FlatLabs6, a similar effort in Cairo.  And the pilot version of the State Departments Global Entrepreneurship program offers mentorship to young Egyptian entrepreneurs, mostly in the tech and IT space.<p>The case for promoting entrepreneurship as a solution in Egypt is strong, especially if one accepts the premise that the main underlying cause of the Revolution was economic  or, in other words, lack of economic opportunities.<p>There are more Egyptian university graduates than ever before, with higher aspirations than any previous generation, yet, in an increasingly competitive and liberal global economy, the government has to this point been unable to generate anywhere near enough jobs that meet their expectations.<p>In February 2011, that discontent probably exacerbated by the effects of the post-2008 global financial crisiscaused the ranks of Egypts previously passionate but relatively small opposition to reach a critical mass, and sweep away the Mubarak regime.<p>Friedman and companys approach is sound.   However, what should not be overdone is the implicit assumption that startup means (or should mean) tech and especially internet company.   Certainly, they have a place, but an equal, if not greater focus should be on the development of new lower-tech, labor-intensive firms, because they are more likely to make an impact in addressing Egypts un and underemployment problems.<p>The primary issue with internet-based startups in this context is that they rarely produce significant numbers of jobs.  For all the media attention they receive, the combined workforce of Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter and Groupon, for example, is less than 20,000 people so it is unlikely that Egyptian web-based companies, especially those based on the development of computer apps, would make a major impact on the job creation front.<p>Moreover, just as Facebooks IPO created a few hundred new super-rich, if any of the profiled Arab internet companies make it big  and some probably will  the financial rewards will go to a few already wealthy investors, or the generally high-skilled computer programmers, who already have plenty of employment opportunities.   This is not a value judgment  they would deserve it, for sure, since they took the initiative and the risks.  But the question here is what does Egypt need more: millions of middle class jobs or perhaps in a best-case scenario a few dozen tech millionaires?<p>Secondly, while developing computer apps to address social problems is noble and should be encouraged, only the relatively affluent will be able to use them.  Egypt is a country where less than 50% of the population uses the internet ever, and only 10-15% can afford access to smartphones where they would use these apps.<p>To the extent that promoting the development of new startup companies is a solution to the countrys problems, at least as much focus, perhaps  more, should be on the development of traditional, low-tech, labor intensive firms, because they are much more likely to create new jobs.<p>And in a country as large as Egypt, there is no shortage of areas where smart and resourceful entrepreneurs could set up profitable firms, that provides good middle class jobs at all skill levels, from MBA types, to mid-level project managers, to unskilled laborers.  Three immediately come to mind:<p>Garbage collection and disposal is one opportunity.   Cairo, a city of over twenty million people, has at best, mediocre trash collection services.  Part of the problem seems to be a lack of competition.  Introducing more alternatives would not only improve quality of life, it is labor intensive, so it would require lots of manpower, nor does it need huge amounts of startup capital, and in a city this size, there will always be demand for great trash collection services.<p>Facilities maintenance is another potential niche.  In general, standards in this area in Egypt are not great and many building are in terrible condition because of decades of systematic neglect.   But  building maintenance is not exactly a luxury its a necessity  and like trash collection there will never be a shortage of potential clients.  If someone could step in with a company that develops a reputation for high quality and responsiveness they could feasibly build up a decent sized business fairly quickly.<p>The biggest opportunity, however, might be in the education sphere.  A major cause of socio-economic disparity in Egypt is the winner-takes-all university entrance exam.  Since  and this is not an exaggeration  a young students entire life trajectory depends on their test score, families feel forced to pay huge fees to tutors (at rates that would be high even in the United States).   As success on the test is often directly related to the quality of ones tutor, those who can afford it, get good instruction, get into the good schools etc, whereas those who can not, are simply unable to compete.<p>An Egyptian entrepreneur that could recruit the right group of teachers could probably find a way to set up high-quality group instruction that charge students half the price they are currently paying, but has virtually unlimited potential for scaling up given that there are several million test takers each year.<p>Finally, at the state level, the new government could have an impact by promoting more of an entrepreneurial mindset in the development of some form of manufacturing.   As Thomas Friedman pointed out, correctly, there is no reason why Egypt should be importing Ramadan Lamps or tourist souvenirs from China, where the cost of labor is much more expensive.<p>To be sure, in a brutally competitive global economy, it will be difficult for Egypt to make manufacturing inroads against China or Europe, but with a serious focus, there is no reason why it couldnt match Saudi Arabias efforts to develop car manufacturing facilities.<p>At the very least, even if not profitable, it would be a good investment.  After all, what is a better use of money?  Increasing social welfare spending as a response to the Revolution, which, aside from being unaffordable, will further increase dependence on the government?  Or to use that same money to build up lower level manufacturing facilities, which will at least create jobs and improve the skill level and confidence of the younger generations (if proper training is involved)?<p>Even in a best-case scenario, the new government will have a hard time doing better than the Mubarak regime in creating additional jobs and opportunity.   Therefore, the single most important thing it can do is to develop a stronger culture of entrepreneurship, and promote a new generation of startup companies, because, as the history of modern business suggests, private initiative is almost always more effective at creating opportunity than government bureaucracies.<p>At the same time, the linkage between startup companies and internet companies should not be overdone.  The biggest impact on the jobs creation front will come from lower-tech, labor intensive firms, and these deserve equal focus in any program that aims to promote entrepreneurship as a solution to Egypts problems.<p>Nathan Field is the co-founder of Industry Arabic.

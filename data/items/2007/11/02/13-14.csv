So there are actually two entries in history.  When you go back one page in history, it jumps forward again.<p>Incidentally, there have been several related products in recent years.  Someone (maybe Sharper Image?) was selling an alarm clock that supported downloadable alarm sounds.  I don't remember exactly, but I think it worked like those digital picture frames.  That's not to say that you couldn't do it better.  But I think your biggest issue may be that most people don't sleep next to their computer.",1194009488

Of all the things to cram into the social trend, waking me up seems like the worst.  I cannot see any reason to let my friends wake me up, or for that matter anything other than my cell phone alarm clock.<p>Others have suggested a FB app, but even that seems like something I would never use.  Just my two cents.",1194009277

You are forfeiting many of the advantages of being an internet company if you are building something that can't be prototyped in weeks rather than months. \n",1194008739

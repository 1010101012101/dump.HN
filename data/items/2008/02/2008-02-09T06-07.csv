112612,comment,112109,112198,0,0,Zak,,,"To be a bit more accurate, GS is fancy shared hosting that lets you do things like host Rails apps on Mongrel on a separate server from your static site. DV is a managed VPS - nothing more, nothing less.<p>If you're not afraid of server administration, there are more cost-effective VPS options. That said, I have a customer on MT, and their service and support are great.",1202540177

112609,comment,112129,112225,0,0,factor,,,"Go&learn C++. It blows my mind how often people confuse C++ with ""C with classes"" in 2008. Granted, C++ isn't as sexy as OCaml, but it's still C plus some rather nice extentions that (finally) got trully portable and work as advertised.<p>Powerful templates plus multiple inheritance give you a very impressive weapon to play with. C# and Java don't even come close.<p>And please... 99% of software on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux are built using the same stuff: C/C++/ObjectiveC.",1202539711

112607,story,,,10,21,yters,"Ask PG: hidden mod commenting?",,"When I mod people, sometimes I'd like to explain why.  However, comments become way too cluttered with noise if many people did this, and not everyone leaves contact information.  Would it be simple to add some kind of hidden mod commenting system?<p>I think this would add value to karma (greater weight to mod points with rationale?).  I suspect conscientious people hold off on modding because they want to communicate their intent, whereas others mod freely without caring about the consequences.  Consequently, there are more ""noise"" points than ""signal"" points, and the information content of karma is lessened.",1202539597

112598,comment,112461,112461,0,0,tx,,,"Heroku is the weirdest company I've seen. Everything started rather typically for a YC-backed group: an announcement of beta on YC news, immediate if not mandatory post on techcrunch, hundreds of enthusiastic comments. Cool.<p>Except this time I feel like I am alone in my feeling that the service is completely useless. Tell me, how is this better than my regular ""offline"" dev tools? How can browser-based JS-IDE even approach a productivity of NetBeans or my beloved Vim? Who told you that having a Rails stack on your own machine is hard? Who told you that deploying your existing (already developed) Rails app is hard? Why would I want Heroku?<p>I do remember that question, on YC application very well: <i>""What is the problem you are trying to solve? What are your users forced to do now?""</i>. I am a typical user of Heroku, and I don't have any problems that need solutions like this. I am not forced to do anyting unpleasant. My life is awesome without Heroku. But I feel soooo dumb because of ""not getting it"".<p>Damn...",1202538924

112592,comment,111846,112102,0,0,cawel,,,"I hear you. But it might not be as weak as you say.<p>Their argument lies in the last paragraph: ""Global Marine Systems [...] says more than 50 cables were cut or damaged in the Atlantic last year; big oceans are criss-crossed by so many cables that a single break has little impact. What was unusual about the damage in the Suez canal was that it took place at a point where two continents' traffic is borne along only three cables.""<p>Although they (indeed) do not point to the cause/s of the cables breakage (which could have effectively dismissed any conspiracy theories), they certainly show that the room for conspiracy is considerably reduced.<p>Plus, they duly remind us of the network's vulnerability in certain locations, the Suez canal in particular.<p>Thus, I would say those 2 points were interesting enough to be highlighted. As for their editorial/biased style, that's The Economist's trademark, like it or not :)",1202538370

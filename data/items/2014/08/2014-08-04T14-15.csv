In the consumer space, this is an even higher number.<p>The thing is, it&#x27;s impossible to know in advance with certainty which will fail and which will succeed. But the ones that do succeed create an enormous return on all that sweat and money. Investors try to pick winners, but even then it&#x27;s acknowledged that the majority of even the best portfolio will not make a large return.<p>From the founder&#x27;s point of view, building something on your own that people genuinely want is an amazing education - even a small amount of success makes a founder far more valuable and goes a long way to expanding their possibilities to try again.",1407164365

Which they can extract info from because having more rows in a still frame doesn&#x27;t mean having more information (at least not linearly), i.e. in still frames with no rolling shutter, rows contain redundant vibration already extracted from previous rows.<p>So having a rolling shutter is good for this specific application because it trades off resolution (most of which is redundant or insignificant information) for sampling rate.",1407164334

8131973,comment,8131971,8131971,1,0,priitmaxx,,,"I have been a fan of inbox zero for a long time, well before the buzz started. I had trained myself to effectively use gmail labels and archived to clean my inbox of non-essential emails. Then along came MailBox and Boxer and I guess many more. They were all amazing! They all understood that emails were quickly becoming peoples todo boxes. Vacation tickets and reservations, information about the parties you are attending this weekend, a report you need to send to your manager and the list went on and on. They are the pioneers in bringing the concept of “inbox zero” and email todo management. I quickly switched from my manual inbox zero to MailBox App when it came out and then to Boxer app (story follows). It all made sense!<p>However,<p>Mailbox has a server side component. When you snooze something to remind you in “3 days”, as far as I understand, the Mailbox server side actually switches the labels between mailbox/todo to inbox and vice-versa. This is a good trick, however, very early on, Mailbox app had server side scaling issues and syncing couldn’t be maintained (at least for me). They of course figured out the problems and I am sure things are fine and dandy. I had more than three big hiccups though. I personally manage around 7 email accounts and things tend to get hectic.<p>Enter BoxerApp. I switched to BoxerApp and even paid the 10 bucks. Boxer is a great app and has no server side component. This makes it great in terms of not having to deal with a serverside scaling issues. However you give up the functionality that mailbox offers. Emails no longer are snoozed. You can attach a time to remind you of the email and it will show up in your todo dashboard.<p>Both Mailbox and Boxer have a very easy to use UX and UI design, which made it a delight to use.<p>Meanwhile iOS 7 came along, out of the box Mail App and Gmail app were becoming more mature. What i started realizing is that in the quest of inbox zero, I was sacrificing extremely fast and slick email apps.<p>During the last two years, I have preached inbox zero to all my friends and family. One thing I realized is none of them saw the value immediately. Some upon my insistence gave MailboxApp a try and gave up. Unanimously the feedback I got was, they all found it stressful to keep up but everyone of them did tell me that they did have most of their todos in their email. Some actually emailed themselves “buy milk”.<p>At the end of all this I realized<p>I wanted to use other apps like gmail or iOS mail app.\nI did want to manage my todos in my email.\nMy statistical research pool (not in the 1000s but more than a 100) indicated that they did want to have a todo list out of their email but did not really want to either do “inbox zero” or replace their current inbox app.\nThis is where MailDo came along. I have been working on the app on and off for a while now. It’s been a hobby more than anything else. My goals with MailDo were:<p>Make a good todo list out of my email with reminders.\nMake my todos available offline\nNOT try to replace my inbox app\nWork along side of any other app you might use or even your own gmail labels, including mailbox or boxer app\nI created MailDo with the following features (for now)<p>Ability to add time to an email and get push notifications to remind.\nNo Server side component.\nPick multiple gmail labels as your todos.\nAbility to add a note on a email thread. I know emails are the todos but I felt after 15 emails back and forth, I would rather have a small post-it style note on the thread that would quickly summarize what my “todo” is.\nA lot of the UI elements are very similar to Mailbox and Boxer and IOS Mail app. Ideally, I wanted to be more creative here but I feel that the industry standard on this UI aspect is pretty much set. Any new UI would not be adding any value, it might be detrimental. Its like trying to reinvent “pull to refresh”. You know when something works!<p>I personally don’t think MailDo is a real business(happened to read this the other day). Its just a feature app, its going to stay that way but I am going to focus on the “todo” part of the email system and keep making this app better. I feel there is a lot of intelligent stuff to do in this space.<p>Would love some feedback in the comments section and rating the app would be a great as well!<p>I fully intend on sharing pretty much every metric about the app in future post, if the app magically gets downloaded by statistically relevant numbers.<p>Thank you.",1407163867

There are many movie qualities that can be very important to you that you can&#x27;t represent with a 5 star rating system. Because of this, the main way Netflix clusters your preferences is by the things they know, like genre, actors, producers/directors, etc., and they assume your high rating is (in part) for these things.<p>This problem is much more prevalent in music suggestions (Pandora, Spotify, etc.) where your preferences are determined almost entirely by genre and artist.<p>The problem is <i>even more</i> prevalent in ratings for restaurants. If you give 5 stars to an excellent Mexican restaurant, Yelp and Google Maps will suggest to you other Mexican restaurants.<p>So as a savvy user, you are in a strange position of having to realize how they are clustering things, and give 5 stars to things you don&#x27;t really like, because you want to be given recommendations for high-rated things in those genres.<p>And you can&#x27;t give 1 star to a movie in a genre that you like, otherwise the system will think you hate that genre.<p>So I would agree with the previous comment, that the &quot;star rating&quot; system is totally broken.",1407163377

Where does the government go to get the lower cost alternative? Where is the downward pressure on your prices?<p>> Please refer to my points re subsides, loans and limits. These are not insurmountable problems.<p>So first you say that market forces will still be in play because the government could always go elsewhere.  Then when provided with an example of a situation where market forces cannot come into play, you suggest that legislation can fix it.  That is EXACTLY what tptacek was the problem, the loss of MARKET incentives and information.<p>> I&#x27;m not sure I follow. Price signals are based on demand.<p>No, no they&#x27;re not.

This is literally econ 101.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand</a><p>Normally demand goes down as price goes up because more and more entities get priced out of the market.  With the government as the sole (or very nearly sole) buyer demand is constant because the government quite literally has a mandate to supply healthcare to the citizens.  That means that suppliers have no incentive (short of avoiding legislative action aimed at them which they can cheaply and easily dodge through lobbying) to bring prices down.  It&#x27;s in their interests (read profit motive) to supply as much as they can at as high of a price as they can.  This is the problem that people are talking about.<p>> 1. If the government is guaranteeing it&#x27;ll pay, why give them a price break?<p>Why indeed?  The threat of legislative action?  See my comments above re: lobbying.  Got a way around that?  Most of the population of the US would be VERY interested to hear how you circumvent it.  So far the only halfway viable strategy is what Lawrence Lessig is doing with mayday.us and that&#x27;s a long way from making it a solved problem.<p>2. If the reason is passing laws saying you have to give them a price break (as you imply in paragraph 2), how is that not price fixing?<p>Again, see comments re: lobbying.  Unless there is no possible way to circumvent the lobbying problem you&#x27;re simply proposing that we replace one broken system which you dislike -- and rightly so, it&#x27;s not that great -- with another broken system which you like.  Sure you like it better but others do not.  We&#x27;re at the point of arguing about opinions.<p>&quot;But other countries do it just fine!&quot; you say.  Okay sure, but which other countries with single payer systems have the kind of demographics that we do here in the US?  Answer: none.  They&#x27;re all relatively small countries (relative to 310mm people) with rather homogeneous demographics (again at least compared to the US).<p>It MIGHT work OK and it MIGHT not be more broken than the system we have now but those aren&#x27;t guarantees.",1407161944

Is it just doing a certain number of features in a day? Does it involve doing support after hours? Considering that they are asking for a &#x27;day&#x27; rate I&#x27;m assuming this is their way of asking if they can retain you for full time work the extent of the contract.<p>In these situations I make it clear that while I&#x27;m willing to make them my primary client my business does require me to attend to other matters such as administration, taxes, billing, lead generation, etc.<p>I never say they can expect X hours out of me a week because quite frankly I&#x27;ve never been good at maintaining a consistent hourly pace per week. When I was doing hourly I averaged about 20 hours a week of programming (I was pretty fanatical about starting/stopping the clock). When I would get closer to 30 that was when I would be pushing a deadline or getting close to burnout.<p>What I do now is get a sense of what they expect out of me in terms of reliability and production. This tends to be a lot of work up front because I&#x27;m building trust with the client. Such as meeting with them more frequently to get on the same page as them. But that up front work pays off dividends later on when I have to bail to attend to family or business matters. Eventually this settles down to weekly communication to see if you&#x27;re actually meeting/exceeding the client&#x27;s expectations.<p>Again I&#x27;d emphasize asking more questions about what they consider a day to be?

The advantage a FPGA provides is really smart custom peripherals.

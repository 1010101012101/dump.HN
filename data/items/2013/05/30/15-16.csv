Just stalled by the FDA that decided it is a medical treatment and needs approval.<p>The FDA approval process usually costs about $150 million, and there is no way to recoup it for anything not patentable.

I found that although Scala is a nice language in many ways, the smallness of the community prevented me from adopting it big time for most work.  The same holds true for languages like F#.  They're fine for special cases (likely what Google intended with Go), but won't be a general purpose replacement for more mainstream languages without some huge advance in support (like what the Rails team did for the Ruby language).<p>Just my humble opinion..",1369929587

Don't let yourself be lulled into inaction.</i><p>On the other hand, in some ways, life today isn't much different than life 30 years ago.  Or even 100 years ago.  Or since the advent of the Industrial Revolution at least.  People wake up, go to work, come home, eat, sleep. In between they go to church, seek mates, sing songs, drink, etc.   The details change, but the basics don't.<p>When I try to think about the future, I usually start from the idea that tomorrow will actually be more like today than we expect.  Even the wildest advances in technology (to date) don't change human nature or basic patterns of human behaviour.  So ask yourself how technology and change will affect out ability to go out, seek mates, drink, seek spiritual enlightenment, find food, earn income, etc.<p>If you believe the evolutionary psychologists, a lot of our basic psychological responses evolved 30,000+ years ago, and we - as humans - are fairly poorly adapted to the world we live in.  Human nature may be fundamentally at odds with an urbanized, technology driven, fast-paced society.

Many languages are not ""associated"" with a country at all. Many languages are spoken in different countries, and many countries have multiple official or common languages.<p>This is why using flags or country codes as language indicators bothers me. Even for English it can be confusing: do you pick the US flag? The UK flag? It also means it is usually impossible to localise a website based on the TLD alone. In most cases you will also need a language code somewhere in the URL. Many web developers forget this.<p>Another important oversight is that not all inhabitants of a country might speak one of the official or common languages.

Pruning strategies are being developed, but they do not prune accounts of balances, they only remove old transactions, so these balances cannot be removed, unless a satoshi stealing strategy is approved which would be a very significant incompatible change.<p>Personally, I would just include the hash in a comment of a payment to myself (or any payment at all), which is easily done with the current bitcoin client. The signature can easily be viewed on blockchain.info and you can use any hash that you like. Finding it would be harder though, but should not be difficult if I know any of the sending, receiving address or transaction id.",1369928777

To say that EME is okay because it would be working with clear-key systems too is complete BS, because such systems already exist and do not need EME.

There's this underlying judgement about the relative worth of writing a Brainfuck interpreter and environment versus drinking in some bar in Guatemala or starting a company, like the latter is obviously a better use of time and energy. Aside from the fact that doing the things you mention aren't mutually exclusive with this little project, it's really tiring to hear (older) people constantly beat the drum of ""you're young! go travel! drink!"" on top of the ""start your own company!"" startup mantra. Maybe you wish you did more of those things when you were younger, or maybe you wish you were doing more of them now, and maybe I will wish the same thing when I'm older...<p>But they are absolutely not for everyone. I think it's disingenuous to just throw out ""take that energy and try to build a company"" as an alternative. Not everyone has it in them to do all the schlep work required to succeed at their own startup, so why assume this person hasn't considered it and chosen not to follow that path? Furthermore, I would personally prefer to tinker with a Brainfuck implementation than spend any amount of time in any bar, even it's in Guatemala or Colombia. I usually find them noisy and unpleasant, and I would find ""partying the night away"" to be a boring waste of time. But I would never suggest someone <i>else</i> shouldn't spend their time that way because that would be assuming a great deal about what's important to them.<p>Maybe this was just a little flip remark on your behalf, not meant to be taken seriously.

You can't even reverse engineer a binary.<p>Native software was scaling up to millions of users before any marketing hack even came up with the term 'cloud'. You are confusing running a web app a decade ago with distributing software a decade ago. You certainly did not need hoards of cash and servers to distribute native software a decade ago. People 20 years ago were writing native software and distributing it to hundreds of thousands of people, and I can assure you the typical shareware author was not investing millions to do that.<p>>The web and web apps are very open.<p>Open until you wan't to do something that isn't allowed by the standards, and then you (and your users) are screwed. On HN we get a lot of submissions about people 'hacking' with web technologies, but nearly all of them are just making use of some new API that has been gifted to them by the browser creating overlords. Which is all well and good and there is nothing wrong with that, but it's not a substitute for hacking on the platform itself and doing things that the creators perhaps didn't want you to do.<p>The real test for an open platform: can it be self hosting? Can I write a web browser as a web app? Not without shunting all the real work to a separate machine that is not limited by the web sandbox.<p>[1] which also applies to nearly all of the evil native platforms that the web is supposedly freeing us from",1369926870

How do you possibly know that people are clicking the 2nd result? You don't. Unless you have access to Wikipedia's analytics, you have NO WAY in knowing. So what you're saying could be true--but could not be true. It's your interpretation, not fact.<p>- I'm seeing paid ads for ""macro recorder"", thus you're the first after the paid ads. ""macro record"" is a bad example of this. A true test would be to unverify for at least a week and see if you have more or less clicks. That is if you end up staying the #1 result. I bet that your rankings would change if you un-verified your site's authorship.<p>- I still see no proof that your traffic went down based on Google Authorship (your photo appearing). So, what you're saying is that you had 90 percent more traffic before you verified authorship? Putting your photo there caused a loss in traffic? I'm not seeing enough proof of that (you're not showing any analytics data).",1369926086

I ride with a mirror mounted on my glasses, and I glance up at it briefly then back at the road again. The same would be true of the glass. Sure, when you're first getting used to it you will probably linger on it for longer due to the novelty and getting used to the exact focus point. But once you get the hang of it, I can't imagine it would be much different than glancing at a mirror, which is perfectly safe.",1369926043

In general, then, resizing all the images in advance and serving them from a traditional CDN offers a better experience at a better price.  Only if that's impossible is imgix a good choice.<p>Being a premium CDN seems a bit like being a premium credit card processor -- as customers grow, they have more and more incentive to switch to a commodity alternative.",1369926002

It helps me get a peaceful full nights sleep, which for me is approximately 7 hours, with and clearheaded thoughts the next day<p>2. As an aid to creativity, but about only 10% or less of the time while working. My mind is getting stronger and so I can now be directly productive while high, however I tend instead to take notes and later revisit those notes while not high for speedier production<p>3. As an aid to learning, but perhaps only 10% or less of the time while studying. Rather I regularly review difficult material lightly while high in order to experience the benefits of heightened abstract thought<p>Very important notes:<p>-- There is a long process to the mind learning about and how to benefit from something as intoxicating as chronic. You won't know many things about it and yourself until you've had a lot of experience<p>-- Chronic is a strong sedative, many people fall asleep easily when they are first getting experience with it<p>-- It is very important to only smoke the female plant. The male plant has a lot of negative effects and can cause you to be groggy similar to over-drinking, and the positive effects are in my opinion not enough to warrant the negative effects<p>-- It's very important to take notes of creative ideas, since your memory for specifics is likely to be fuzzy<p>-- When approaching new concepts and abstracts<p>-- If you care about your productivity and learning, wait until you've gained lots of experience before trying to accomplish or study when you're high, otherwise a lot valuable time can be wasted. With a bit of experience it because possible to learn which creative and learning experiences can be directly improved from smoking<p>-- Use a vaporizer. It is not 100% safe as others have claimed, but it significantly reduces risks, as well as reduces all forms of odor, red eyes, etc, and the dosage can be controlled better<p>My programming capability has become so significantly better from smoking, but legal and medical dangers shouldn't be taken lightly. People who already know they are susceptible to self-destructive behavior need to realize that this is a drug that can sedate you heavily and it's important to learn when you can and cannot take it due to pressing work.<p>But as a way to improve your programming skills and learn abstract concepts (functional programming, linear algebra, and so on) and connecting the dots between fields of study its a godsend.<p>Plus, you'll just be happier :-)",1236693596

I think he moved pretty well for a big guy, but the judges didn't agree with me.<p>It was great to hear him go on about how he's used to digital things and how dance is analog, all while his dance partner's eyes glazed over.  He's lost 30 pounds while practicing for the competition, so even if he loses the competition right away, he's got that going for him.<p>It's also great to see Woz, who apparently doesn't need the money, doing it just for fun.  He stands out from some of the other ""celebrities"" who really are just desperate for a paycheck.

I kinda like that sometimes - I like interacting with people - but I can see how some wouldn't.<p>Beyond that, popularity might be an issue.  Just like avoiding certain work can be a driver, so can the want to be popular.  Free things are going to be more popular and I think most of us would like to help as many people as possible and we'd at least like to think that our programming helps people (whether it's fun or makes their work easier or whatever).<p>If you can pull off free, it's a wonderful thing.  Being able to help people at no cost is great.  However, it isn't always the best or most practical thing.  Often times it means that you'll have a lot of users who you can't give any support to and lackluster resources for improvement.",1236692961

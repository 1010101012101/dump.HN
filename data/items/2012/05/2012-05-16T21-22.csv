As such, the discussions become kind of confused. For example, not being someone too excited about Node myself, I still found this particular article kind of strange: I see no issue at all with using JavaScript on the server and in fact think that's the best part about Node. I am on the end of the spectrum where I don't even understand the point of discussing what language ""deserves"" to be on the server.<p>However, due to the hyper success of Node, we were left in this strange place where Node became <i>the</i> defacto JavaScript platform, and you can't really use JavaScript on the server/desktop without it (you can I guess, but don't expect anyone else to be able to use your code easily). As such, I think part of the reason you have people who want to use Node ""for everything"", is that a lot of them just actually want to use JavaScript ""for everything"", which is a less contentious issue in my opinion. In a world where you had ""JavaScript on the server"", and the optional ""Node library"" where you could do evented programming, vs. a different Rail/synchronous style library, you'd have something that looks a lot more like the other programming worlds.<p>I for example want to use JavaScript as my ideal scripting environment on the desktop, which is not that well suited for the asynchronous model of Node (just reading a bunch of files, operating on them, and then spitting out a new file can be kind of tedious with this model -- I'm not really waiting on anything or trying to hold a million open connections simultaneously). JavaScript itself I think competes just fine against Python and Ruby for these tasks, but again we can't really compare them in this abstract way, we have to compare JavaScript in the particular way it exists in Node, which brings along a lot of opinionated asynchronous APIs.",1337203095

I think that someone hasn't had his history homework done.
The things is that the root of the problem is somewhere else. If you think about evolution for a second. Weaker species are removed, stronger survive. It leads to creating better and better species. On the other hand, if we helped weaker species to survive as well, then not only this natural filter is effectively stopped, but also ironically, the situation is even worse for the stronger ones. That would inevitably make the whole ecosystem poor.<p>To wrap it up, if God (or some other kind of Force) decided to help poor species, we, humans, would never exist.

Leave it to the professionals. We don't need to teach everyone to be a master carpenter, right?<p>""Learning to code,"" isn't just about teaching people another vocation. We don't teach kids to be carpenters because we know that with a little math, some reading, and advice from a carpenter that kid could figure it out. If you give them a rule in the imperial system and blueprints in metric they should be able to figure it out. Mathematics and literacy give them tools to solve <i>other</i> problems. We consider them fundamental tools.<p>The reason why teaching people to <i>compute</i> or ""code"" as some are putting it is to teach them a kind of literacy. You can't take the fundamental math and reading skills you're taught in school and write a computer program to classify your email for you or scrape the sports scores off your favorite site to track your bets. Without understanding the fundamental concepts of computation there are a whole categories of problems and inefficiencies that persist unaddressed.<p>So what's wrong with teaching people the basics? Most people can figure out how to unclog a drain or bang together a decent shed without investing their lives into becoming master plumbers and architects. It may be easy to think that today there just aren't the prevalence of problems in peoples' lives where a rudimentary understanding of what a program is and what a process is can solve, but I dare you to keep hold of that notion for the next ten years. Programming to those who are experienced practitioners is a skill that is easily taken for granted. You may think that programming involves sitting in front of a computer noodling with compilers while life passes you by but you'd be wrong. With enough of a basic understanding, the fundamentals, that we can give someone an intuition about what a program is and how it can be used to spin off processes that can do work for you and apply the things you learned in your maths classes or automate tedious work in your research... we can really make the world a much better place.<p>How would software patent reform still be an issue today if we had been educating people on the fundamentals of computer science for the past few decades instead of hiding it in the upper eschalons of academia? Would phishing scams still be profitable with fewer rubes? How much inefficiency could be saved in research, finance, design, journalism, and so forth if everyone had at least a basic understanding of what a program is? Sadly most people don't it seems. They use computers all day long but if you get talking with them about it they don't understand what the machine is doing... they're just merrily typing in and clicking on the things they're told to and wouldn't have the faintest idea if there was a better way to do things. Such is the way the world is when people are ignorant of the tools they use.<p>It's simple to dismiss now and maybe in ten years time your friends and family will still throw their hands up at computers and marvel at how the hell they work. Perhaps as many people do now with math. But that's a poor reason to suggest people shouldn't be taught these things and should remain ignorant.",1337202501

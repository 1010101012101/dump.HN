That way they all get their Obamacare creds without having to actually fix anything.<p>If they want to actually repeal health care, they are going to have to wait until they have a Republican president, or a veto-proof majority, which won't happen until 2012 at the earliest.  There may not be repeal momentum left at that point.<p>Slightly more on-topic, having things like this on your medical record is a concern, but I think keeping one's good health should always be more important than insurance details that may or may not make any difference.",1288900767

You probably wonder: ""Why not simply delay the processing of new data while the old data is being processed?"". The problem lies in the fact we're dealing with a <i>stream</i> which <i>always</i> brings in new data. Eventually, the virtual line up of delayed data will occupy all available memory.<p>A solution to this is to dispatch the data between multiple computers which can each independently process the data they receive and then send back the result of their processing to a central computer whose job is to put back the results together. Can't keep up with the stream? Simply add a new computer! That's more or less what S3 does.",1288900627

1870509,comment,1869909,1869909,0,0,Symmetry,,,"Not to defend the patent system too much, my experience with it mostly involves a second parties trying to patent ideas that others came up with, but there seems to be a bit of a selection effect problem here.  Of all the people who consider copying something patented, some fraction of them are stopped by the presence of the patent.  Of all the people who independently invent something you would expect only a very small percentage to be stopped by a patent.  Also, someone who knowingly copies someone else's work knows to hide the fact.<p>So unless we know what percentage of people were stopped from copying someone else's work without the need for a lawsuit, this study alone doesn't tell us very much about the social costs and benefits of patents by itself.  I tend to believe that our patent system is too strong and I might very well mention it in discussions with proper caveats, but we need more research.",1288900538

Some people (predominantly, but not exclusively, Asian and American aboriginal peoples) either lack or are deficient in the ability to produce the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. That has two major effects: it encourages hangovers; and for those lucky enough to have the ability to metabolize acetaldehyde to an opioid analogue, it triggers the physical addiction cascade at a much lower level of intake. (Which, by the way, is why Antabuse is utterly ineffective in treating bafflingly hard-core alcoholics. It works by blocking acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, allowing toxic levels to build up in the system. It may bring on near-death hangover symptoms, but it also provides the fuel for an experience not entirely unlike mainlining heroin.)",1288899540

More specifically, I primarily worked on Visual Studio integration.<p>Xbox Live Indie games has been an incredible, internal, uphill battle from the start. No one on any of the teams really wanted any of those restrictions, but a lot of factors were conspiring against us.<p>1) Legal: Indie games went into development long before Apple released the iPhone App Store. There was sooo much fear about allowing arbitrary content out there. There are also privacy concerns (think about people selling Facebook user IDs and stuff; similar things apply to Gamertags) preventing open internet access; specially considering young kids may play Xbox. Startups can ""get away with stuff"". Hell, Google and Apple can get away with this stuff. Microsoft can't, or simply won't.<p>2) Security: Full Xbox 360 titles run with full control over the box. Registered developers are trusted fully. This is in part due to simplicity, but also because games are really demanding software that want to avoid kernel call boundaries and other low level performance sucking security measures.<p>3) Cannibalization: Xbox Live Arcade (professional downloadable games) is big business. Leadership was terrified that people were going to systematically clone all of the best selling games. Hence silly rules like no free games and segregated Top Games listings.<p>4) Internal support: The XNA team is full of amazingly talented engineers. And amazingly savvy project managers. There are sooo many dependencies that go into XNA, it is simply incredible. Between the various platforms, SDKs, APIs, web services, etc. It could take two full days to just install all the stuff you need to be able to use a dev machine effectively. Such is the pain of working on a product that cross cuts about a dozen different layers of the technology stack; each layer independently written by a team larger than the entire XNA team itself. With so many partner teams, it is a miracle that Indie Games shipped at all.<p>5) Politics: At Microsoft, success is poisonous. If your team is talented and effective, if your product is sexy and fun -- and XNA was certainly all of these things -- then every middle manager in the entire damn company wants a piece of your action. We got re-org-ed so many times, I lost count. When XNA 1 launched on Xbox, it was a triumph. Then we spent a ton of time onboarding the latest platform, like Zune or Windows Phone, that management forced down our throats.<p>There is more, but this post is getting out of hand....",1288899039

1870373,comment,1869226,1869226,0,0,vasi,,,"In the spirit of evidence-based reasoning, why don't we look at what happens where political parties are absent or weak? This includes the new Afghanistan parliament, Colombia before 2005, Liberia, the Philippines, the Thai senate, and numerous municipal councils. Some of these forbid parties entirely, some discourage them by using electoral systems such as the single non-transferable vote, others simply have a political culture that frowns upon them. A few of the resulting characteristics may indeed be positive: debate is often vigorous, attention is paid to local concerns, and populist movements can rapidly reach power (though some may see that last one as a negative!) Generally, however, there are a number of problems:<p>What are elections like? First of all, proportional representation is difficult-to-impossible without parties, which eliminates one potentially fruitful type of political reform. Second, without party organizations to provide guidance as to a candidate's political stance, the ""personal vote"" predominates. This means a candidate needs extremely strong name recognition and personal financial resources: elected members are much more likely to be former entertainment celebrities, business magnates, leaders of ethnic or religious groups, local crime-lords or warlords, or of course incumbents. Another way to get personal recognition is to take credit for local spending, so candidates' campaigns tend to focus on the pork they'll bring if elected.<p>What about after the elections? Without a strong parliamentary whip, elected members can vote however they want, which sounds great—but it means that every single vote becomes an exercise in pulling teeth. Each member has an interest in acting recalcitrant in order to receive compensation in exchange for their vote. Governing coalitions end up ideologically incoherent, based mostly on which members are most in need of money for local projects. Since there's no ideological basis for government, changes of prime minister/president can happen either extremely often or extremely rarely, depending mostly on whether or not there are enough goodies to be passed around.<p>All this talk of weakening parties may show a lack of knowledge about the rest of the world. If you look around, you'll see that other nations, and most scholars, consider American political parties to be quite weak. Most countries with healthier political systems have parties that are perhaps smaller than the Democrats and Republicans, but are much stronger in the sense of having control over their elected members and candidates.<p>I'd argue that in the USA, we should be strengthening parties. Allow party whips to demand discipline from members, expelling those who will not vote with the rest of the party. Once a party wins Congress, they'll have to actually implement their agenda—no more making promises that are impractical or that they know they can't keep, and then blaming recalcitrant party members for preventing the passage of laws. Now, each party contains multiple opposing factions that proclaim incompatible visions. Instead, parties could decide internally what policies to support, and then the dissidents could just deal with it. Or dissidents could go start their own party, and you'd finally have some real diversity of views. Corporate influence could even fall. After all, it's a lot harder to bribe (I mean, uh, ""contribute to the campaign of"") an entire party to change their votes than to bribe one or two members.<p>One of the great recent successes of electoral design was in fact a party-strengthening exercise. In the unrecognized pseudo-country of Somaliland, political organization was nearly absent, and the nascent leaders worried that the new democratic system would become corrupt, based on local warlords and ethnic leaders. So first they held municipal elections across the country, and only the three parties with the highest nationwide total vote in these elections would be allowed to run in the subsequent national elections. Voilà! A new, fragile country developed three ideological, non-ethnic political parties; and while there are still serious problems there, the political system is pretty good for that region of the world.<p>The one issue I haven't really addressed is ""what about the Interwebs!?"" True, most of my information is from third world countries, where the Internet is not a serious factor. Non-partisan municipal governments in the West also have the problems I listed though, and have not typically been revolutionized by the Internet. But who knows, perhaps Naheed Nenshi's election in Calgary is the vanguard of a wave of social-network-inspired non-partisan renewal, I guess we'll see!",1288898442

SCOTUS has upheld a doctrine of ""administrative searches"", taken in order to advance public safety rather than criminal investigations, which are explicitly intended to apply universally, without a warrant, and without individualized suspicion.<p>The second bit of background you should have is 49 USC 44925, which <i>mandates</i> that the TSA research and deploy advanced screening technology, specifically to detect nonmetallic objects. I'm no lawyer, but I do enjoy reading SCOTUS civil liberties opinions, and by and large the court seems to give deference to the legislature when no clear constitutional issue is at stake. In sum: the court has an ""out"" here, which is ""the intent to search passengers is already constitutional, so if this variant of the search is so bad, pass a law"".<p>The Supreme Court has not outlawed strip searches (obviously they can't, as virtually everyone who gets arrested and booked is strip searched, guilty or not). If you read the Savana Redding opinion (8-1 ""it's unconstitutional to strip search an 8th grade girl for ibuprofen""), you'll see things like ""Its indignity does not outlaw the search, but it does implicate the rule that ""the search [be] ‘reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.’"". That is, unfortunately, not a hard case for TSA to make. The fact that the Savana search was for ""nondangerous contraband"" also factored into the opinion.<p>(If you want to throw up in your mouth a little bit, track down Clarence Thomas' dissent which argued that it is indeed constitutional to strip search a 13 year old girl in school to track down Advil.)<p>Finally, the arguments EPIC makes here do not seem awesome. Part of their argument turns on administrative rulemaking procedures at TSA, which TSA seems to dismantle efficiently in their response. Other parts drag in things like the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which is (a) a longshot argument for petitioners who can claim no personal religions infringed on and (b) is neatly sidestepped by the TSA ""opt-out"" rule. Speaking of opt-out: EPIC claims that there is no effective opt-out procedure, which is also a hard argument to defend without an example of someone refused an opt-out. And on this janky scaffold of arguments, EPIC wants an emergency injunction against the scanners?<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm obviously in their corner on this. I'm thrilled if they win. And they've got some painful evidence, such as FOIA docs showing TSA required machines with store/transmit capabilities (oops!). But my guess is that if we want to get rid of the strip search machines, we're going to have to do it by voting out the people who approved them.",1288898158

I would like to see what kind of work the people were doing who were tossed.  For example, in my experience most companies have way too many middle management.  In that scenario it makes sense to cut no matter what so go ahead and use some performance metric (and definitely don't wait a year to do it).<p>Then you have rank and file employees are are actually doing the work.  Even in a relatively low skill position the company might have to put in 1-2 months of training to have an employee functioning.  Unless the employee is completely horrible (in which case they should be fired anyway, and if this keeps happening hiring practices should be analyzed), from a cost standpoint it makes more sense to coach them to do better rather than remove them.<p>In higher skill positions it makes even less sense to just cut the bottom unless the bottom is doing very poorly.  In that case they should have been cut prior to ranking.  Where I work now we don't expect someone to get fully up to speed until they have been in our codebase for 3-6 months.  If we constantly ranked, fired, and hired again we would only have a few good people at the top end doing all of the work and simply churning money on the bottom end.  We might find a superstar who displaces the top, but does that mean you want to fire your previous tops?  They were doing fine, and presumably still are, until the superstar showed up.<p>Again, I have no problem with ranking people or with firing people for poor performance.  The problem is picking an arbitrary line and firing people who fall below it even if their raw performance is acceptable.",1288897715

But honestly Monica, the web is considered ""public domain"" and you should be happy we just didn't ""lift"" your whole article and put someone else's name on it! It happens a lot, clearly more than you are aware of, especially on college campuses, and the workplace. If you took offence and are unhappy, I am sorry, but you as a professional should know that the article we used written by you was in very bad need of editing, and is much better now than was originally. Now it will work well for your portfolio. For that reason, I have a bit of a difficult time with your requests for monetary gain, albeit for such a fine (and very wealthy!) institution. We put some time into rewrites, you should compensate me! I never charge young writers for advice or rewriting poorly written pieces, and have many who write for me... ALWAYS for free!""</i><p>The thing that struck me most about this reply was how perfect it is as an illustration of how <i>not</i> to deal with people when a problem arises.<p>1. When someone is angry about something you did, it is not right to adopt a breezy tone, as if you are doing some online chat with a friend. This is a disrespectful way of denigrating the concerns raised by that person.<p>2. The same can be said about the patronizing attitude - the ""I have been around forever and know all there is to know about copyright and don't need to hear complaints from someone is an ignoramus on the topic"" attitude. Even when you are in the right in dealing with, say, a disaffected customer, you <i>never</i> patronize in this way. It immediately causes the person to feel ""shat upon,"" if I might use that phrase, and to react badly, even if you are correct in your position. When a problem exists, address it directly and don't play games with trying to act superior to the person making the complaint.<p>3. If you are going to address a legal complaint, at least make some minimal effort to understand what you are talking about. I understand that people can have philosophical disagreements about how copyright is enforced but one should not purport to make statements about technical issues of law when one has no idea what one is talking about. Here, just about everything the writer says about copyright is wrong and very obviously so.<p>4. When someone is already upset, you don't go about gratuitously provoking that person in responding to the complaint. ""We stole your work but it really stunk and we did you a favor by writing it far better than you ever could have done"" is the sort of response that must rank right up there with other classics in asinine fatuity.<p>I am sure there are other things wrong with this as well but this is surely a list of very obvious things to avoid in dealing with a complaint. This sort of thing is guaranteed to provoke, inflame, and escalate the problem to a point where this person will surely regret it.",1288897490

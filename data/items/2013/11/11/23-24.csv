6714953,comment,6714349,6714349,1,0,cromwellian,,,"For those interested in GWT, I&#x27;ve got a similar library I&#x27;m working on for GWT, but I call it &quot;PoA&quot; for Page-Oriented-Architecture. The idea is to have the best of both worlds from both an SPA (Single-Page-Application) standard point, while preserving the fundamental webby-ness of URLs/pages. Of course, since it is Java, a lot of code is shared between server and client, running full performance in the JVM, plus globally optimized JS on the client.<p>It works by authoring all pages in HTML/CSS/WebComponents with basic MDV-style two-way databinding as separate stand-alone pages. These are then globally optimized together as a monolithic SPA application, and then code-split back into separate pieces. A servlet then processes the template on the server, does the data binding, and sends back a fully rendered bit of HTML + inlined JSON data within a single HTTP request. The JS code starts up and binds to the template and model, and then launches async loads of the rest of the compiled templates.<p>You get URL addressability, crawlability, fast initial page load, plus SPA-style fast switches, global aggressive optimization, offline, sharing of heap objects between pages, etc.<p>Initial hacked up draft of what I&#x27;m prototyping <a href=""http://goo.gl/ZNpxTk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/ZNpxTk</a>",1384214371

From a usability perspective, undo is always best. Especially undo that the user: 1) knows about, 2) trusts, and 3) is fast. That encourages exploration and lets users fix mistakes.<p>> their mistake has now limited the actions that every other user of the system can make, because the system will be modified to prevent other users from making the same mistake.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a black and white issue. It&#x27;s not about denying all users the ability to express X ever again. I think it&#x27;s more about having systems that can tell if X is an unusual or heavyweight action and say, &quot;Hey, you&#x27;re about to do X, which impacts a lot of stuff and you&#x27;ve never done before. Are you sure that&#x27;s what you mean?&quot;<p>It&#x27;s velvet rope permissions, not a locked door.",1384214073

6714934,comment,6712717,6714710,27,0,rayiner,,,"> Why not give everyone the same bonus based on company performance? Make it collective good.<p>I don&#x27;t know whether this is common in other industries, but at top American law firms, salary raises and bonuses are lockstep. That means everyone gets paid based strictly on seniority. At many firms, this even carries through the partnership ranks.<p>There are benefits and disadvantages to such a system. The benefit is that it reduces competition between workers, and reduces unproductive credit-seeking. When you rank people against each other, the focus ultimately shifts to optimizing to the ranking metric, which is inevitably different than actually optimizing job performance. Such systems favor people who are good at taking credit, not people who get the best results. Lockstep systems also increase cooperation: nobody avoids helping someone else or avoids working on a stronger team for fear of the zero-sum nature of rankings.<p>The downside is that strict lockstep systems keep you from giving superstars extra compensation. This can be a liability if you don&#x27;t have a uniformly high quality of employee, because superstars will leave for companies that offer individualized compensation. That being said, the advantages of individualized compensation decrease as it becomes more difficult to achieve true measures of individual performance. Nobody complains about individualized performance ratings on Wall Street, because it&#x27;s easy to compute how much money a trader made for the firm or the value of the deals an investment banker worked on. The relevant metrics are objective and hard to game. It&#x27;s much more difficult to evaluate a programmer&#x27;s contribution to a development team.<p>The most troubling thing to me about stack ranking is not ranking per se, but the fact that stack ranking is applied by HR departments. This issue has come up before in the context of hiring, and what I said then is the same thing I&#x27;ll say here: HR should not be involved in hiring, or firing! It&#x27;s perfectly okay to identify weak performers and fire them, but it should be an organic process that happens based on the decisions of technical leadership. HR folks are administrative people. They&#x27;re there to fill out W-2 forms and keep you from getting sued by disgruntled employees. They do not have domain expertise and do not know what makes for an effective technical employee.<p>This is an area where tech companies need to take a page from Wall Street rather than traditional Big Corps. At an investment bank, a banker decides who to hire and who to fire, not some HR person who has no understanding of banking. To make this system tractable, firing decisions are made at a low level, early and often. That prevents getting into a situation where the organization builds up a glut of weak performers that need to be fired in some comprehensive and systematic culling.",1384214065

(I have implemented and watched several mongo migrations and refactorings)<p>Because you <i>have</i> a schema, but mongo doesn&#x27;t model it, you&#x27;re left to your own devices to implement the migration.  If you have real data, and a normal legacy situation, you can&#x27;t assume all data will necessarily follow the &quot;schema&quot; you think you have - after all, it&#x27;s implicit.  But that means that writing the migration can be quite tricky.  There are no validations, no foreign key checks, no constraints you can use to validate your migration did what you think it did.  You&#x27;ll need to do all that in your own code.  This is short for: you&#x27;re going to be lazy and not check it quite as well as you would have otherwise, and the checks you <i>do</i> implement might be buggy.<p>Furthermore, if a particular entity does fail a migration... what then?  In postgres, which supports transactional DDL, you can rollback schema changes - so even if the last entity failed to migration because your assumptions were wrong - and even if the validation had to be in code, not in the database - you can revert to the initial situation.  In mongo?  Uh-oh; you&#x27;re in trouble.  You better be in a copy of your production database; but if you are, that means that your main database needs to be offline or in read-only mode so that writes aren&#x27;t lost.  Does mongo have a read-only flag?  By contrast, postgres (and other Sql databases) are transactional and support snapshots - you can do the safe migration with rollback support all while <i>online</i> for as long as there aren&#x27;t any conflict; and when there are, it&#x27;s detected, and you have a range of options from locking to retries to avoid the conflicts.<p>In practice, I can&#x27;t imagine a worse tool for schema and datamodel changes.  If your schema change is trivial, it&#x27;s not so bad; but then, if you&#x27;re only renaming a property that has no external references to it or adding a property or whatever - sql is trivial too.<p>Mongodb for schema-changes is sort of like writing an automated refactoring for a dynamic programming language codebase that&#x27;s too large to manually inspect at all and without unit tests tests nor a VCS.  You won&#x27;t necessarily know what goes wrong or even if anything goes wrong; you won&#x27;t get system support for guaranteeing at least minimal consistency; and if something goes wrong you&#x27;ll have a corrupted half-way state.",1384212734

You create teams of people, that automatically have either pull, push/pull, or administrative permissions on every repository they touch. Then, when you go to the &#x27;collaborators&#x27; section, you simply add those teams of people, without being able to see what access level you are awarding to that specific repository! It makes no sense. Either the permissions should be RIGHT next to the team name in the drop down or (much better) GitHub should decouple groups from the permissions they have, and permissions should be awarded on a per-repository basis. That you way you are granting X group of people Y permissions on Z repository. You are always explicitly granting a permissions level to a specific group of people, and no permissions are automatically added that you haven&#x27;t explicitly signed off on for that repository.<p>Maybe there&#x27;s some logic behind it, but I doubt it, and I&#x27;m really not sure if GitHub completely thought it through.",1384212392

In my POSIX programming class, we wrote lots of programs (malloc, web proxies, and so on). In my graphics class, we wrote renderers (while paper tests covered the algebra of geometry). In my PDE classes, we wrote simulation code in Matlab and saw it run on wave and heat equations.<p>In mech, though, scarcely any classes had an experimental component. Fluids? Nope. Heat transfer? Negative, barring a baking orb lab and a Reynold&#x27;s number lab. Machine design? Hah, fat chance--a 25 page report on a fucking bolt was the capstone assignment (alternately, a failure analysis on a gear tooth that chipped in a transmission). Control systems? A few tedious labs more suited to padding out a grad student&#x27;s paper on teaching engineering than actually, you know, teaching us anything.<p>The height of this nonsense was a mandatory lab on power generation--one in which we finally got to run a steam powerplant! Except we didn&#x27;t, and were given the results to run our analysis on instead. Sitting in the campus pub afterwards and grousing into my beer, a facilities guy from the central plant expressed surprise--they&#x27;d specifically made sure to have steam run out to make that lab happen. The lab was cancelled because that steam wasn&#x27;t available, nominally--more likely, the student running it was looking for a way out.<p>The only good labs we had were an industrial processes lab (machining, welding, and so on), and a strength of materials lab (tension, torsion, and whatnot).<p>I guarantee that at the end of four years any of our CS or EE kids were substantially better coders--I cannot claim the same for the mechanical engineers I graduated with.<p>Our final design project was our one true chance to show that we could actually <i>build</i> something, and for many teams that too resulted in failure.<p>EDIT:<p>The problem with so much of this is that there are perfectly good ways these things could be taught.

Make it collective good.<p>Company performance is not dependent on the performance of any one single individual. That is, I can be the laziest, most incompetent developer or middle manger, and it would have no bearing on quarterly earning. So if you&#x27;re using company-wide performance bonuses to stimulate productivity, in a company of thousands of employees, you&#x27;re doing something wrong. The incentive in that case is for each individual to do as little as possible because why exert yourself if you&#x27;re just going to get as much as the next guy anyway, and the result is everyone loses. This is a classic &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; scenario, where the incentive is to be a cheater.<p>So the idea of rewarding high achievers (carrot) and punishing under-achievers (stick) is a good one. That&#x27;s what you need to do, and that&#x27;s how you properly set up the incentives.

6714725,comment,6711192,6712481,2,0,dmunoz,,,"> It depends on what you consider an operation, doesn&#x27;t it?<p>Exactly. I see far too many people lately who want to point out the technically correct (a.k.a. best kind of correct) version of algorithmic complexity where e.g. multiplication is not constant time. Often this is paired with the contrasting complexity analyses having different meanings for the N in the big O notation, e.g. bit complexity of input vs. number of elements input. Note, this is not the case above, but is often what I see happen. It&#x27;s very sloppy to directly compare the two as they are making wildly different assumptions on what is constant time. The model matters. An example used in a parallel computing class I took was that comparison based sorting on P parallel processors could be done in log N time (less than the Nlog(N) lower bound of comparison based sorting) in the PRAM model where memory access across parallel processors is still O(1).",1384211072

Overall I think we were really pleased though with the reliability and quality; we didn&#x27;t experience any drops, or much packet loss or jitter.<p>I would say the biggest hurdle was audio.

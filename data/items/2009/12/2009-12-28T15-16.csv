In fact I'd go so far as to say it hasn't been for fighting since the invention of firearms - most martial arts focus on other aspects now.<p>I think your focus is too limited. It's like saying ""I thought modern hiphop had killed all traditional music styles,"" when encountering somebody practicing a violin.<p>Probably in most cases, people attend their local Karate or Tae Kwon Do school as a form of exercise that's less boring than doing 30 minutes on a treadmill. In many of those cases that might be the only exercise they get. Lots of people study styles because they like how they look, or they prefer a meditative aspect of them, or they enjoy the storied history of the style or really want to learn how to handle a spear or something. Learning to beat an opponent in 1 on 1 combat is merely a single aspect of the Martial Arts.<p>Interestingly, this is something that's even showing up in other modern non-MMA martial arts that are pretty well tested in combat. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jailhouse_rock_(fighting_style)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jailhouse_rock_(fighting_style)</a><p>I actually think MMA styles would be <i>more</i> appealing to the public if they learned and promoted the non-combat aspects of martial training (discipline, fitness, respect your parents, etc.). Right now, outside of MMA circles, those styles are largely viewed similarly to boxing -- rough sports for rough people. Not everybody wants to be a rough person.

1018676,comment,1017708,1017926,0,0,elblanco,,,"Just go to your local martial arts school and ask them if they have any black belt tests coming up. In most disciplines the black belt tests are comprehensive and gives you a great overview of the style. Typically they cover all the forms they learned up to that point, some sparring, and if the style does board breaking they'll do some of that.<p>Some styles don't quite follow those patterns, but can be entertaining to watch anyways. The Akido black belt tests are like watching a violent dance.<p>My personal preference is to go watch a black belt/sash test at a local Kung Fu school (not Tai Chi or Wing Chun). Usually you'll see about a dozen really interesting forms, including a variety of traditional weapons, and two and three person forms, and some sparring. Typically you won't see board breaking in Chinese styles. If the style involves Chin-na you'll see some joint locking and maybe wrestling. It's kind of a tour of 1500 years of martial arts history.<p>At one school I went to, the test was about 4-5 hours long, and continuous (no breaks) -- apparently the student had also undergone a 1 hour fitness pretest before qualifying for the test which included some crazy metrics like 100 v-sits, 100 push-ups, 15 minutes in a low horse stance and some other things.<p>These guys were very fit.",1262014381

1018671,comment,1017912,1017985,0,0,yardie,,,"""Personally, I think it's the right thing: rich or poor, the high-achieving students who breeze through are cheap and easy to educate. If the classroom isn't keeping them busy, it tends to be easy to find them extra-curricular opportunity. Meanwhile, many initially struggling students can be turned around and turned into huge cultural assets, education-wise. It's a good investment to try (in smart ways).""<p>You can't use cheap and extra-curricular activities together to form any reasonable conclusion. When the budget hammer falls the first thing thrown out are extra-curricular activities and the district will then point out how expensive they are to maintain. You toss out extracurricular like it has no structure or purpose. As if throwing some dice in the room is good enough activity. All of the leaques I participated in were highly structured, well-organized, and well-funded. And the teachers running these things were deeply invested.<p>The most brilliant and the most lacking are the most expensive students a school can have. I know this from a long time because my school was pushing for more gifted students, anyone that had a modicum of a functioning brain was tested. The state and fed kicked in extra money that was then diverted to other purposes: security, struggling students, ESOL.<p>""the tenure system and lack of measurement of teacher performance is a huge problem""<p>Tenure has been around for hundreds of years and no one has been able to explain why it's a bad idea. At the university level it makes sense. You devote yourself to years of work with no immediate payoff and you don't want that ruined by some bean counter. Unpopular ideas have to be protected the same as popular ones.<p>Tenure in highschool doesn't exist unless you can point to one that explicitly has it. This is not to confuse it with unions. There has been quantitative data of teacher performance available for years. The teacher knows it, the school knows it, hell the principal and vps also have access to it. The problem is these teachers have to be replaced. It's much cheaper to put pressure on a problematic teacher who knows the game after 10 years then train a fresh college grad who might stick it out for 1 year.<p>I've had 5 friends go into teaching after college.

Michael Jackson's death) and show relevant content within a maximum of a couple of minutes, is scalable and can handle the load if it becomes popular, has a low enough latency for the end user (a single server in a basement halfway around the world does not do the trick), AND offers something of significance that makes users actually want to change their habits and switch from their current search engine... Now, that's a whole different story.<p>Especially the last one is tricky. Even though I agree that in theory the cost of switching search engines is pretty close to zero, these habits die hard unless you have something to offer that is obviously much better.<p>So while Cuil and Powerset got a little bit of IT media attention, I don't think it is fair to say that they actually grabbed that much of Google's market share?  And I'm not really sure it is that easy to make a new search engine that will be able to get the market share of ie.  Yahoo!, Bing or Ask.  Unless you can do most of the things mentioned above AND you have that extra special feature on top that makes everyone stop and stare.

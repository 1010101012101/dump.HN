Fitting in with the team isn't important because we want you to spend all your free time with your coworkers (god no, go get some fresh air!), but because we want people to naturally want to help and teach each other.<p>My point is that decent people are out there. Not just in startups, but in a variety of environments. Just make your next company one you pick because of the cool people you met in the interviewing process, not because they offered $5k more than the other guy. Your sanity isn't worth losing over that.<p>If you're a frontend, iOS, or backend (Open to anybody willing to learn Python) engineer who wants to work with people who work sane hours and still get things done, contact me. :)",1336503458

It's a C#/.NET project so we use NCover as part of the automated build.  NCover has a reporting tool that you can set to return a non-zero return value (which will fail most build systems) if it's metrics exceed some value -- in this case class-level cyclomatic complexity exceeding 20.<p>I've thought about ratcheting it down to 15 based on stuff I've read, but unfortunately that particular failure metric can only be set as low as the class-level in the latest version.  The next version (4.0) will have the ability to set the threshold at the method level.<p>In any case, I'd rather have a handful of places in the code where someone has to do something goofy to work around that metric rather than accidentally allow the whole project's complexity to creep up as time goes on.",1336503099

Amazon is (from my perspective) an environment that does not value the individual: their engineers are not permitted to blog or otherwise describe their work -- and participating in an open source project is so outside their culture that no one dare even ask the question. The good news:  Amazon is the exception, not the rule.  Other environments (large and small) empower the individual -- and I think that that is the essence of what you're looking for.

Lets assume 400 movies are screened per year in NY/LA, 200 widely in the US, and 125 in foreign theaters.  It is simply not possible for all 400 movies to have a simultaneous global release.  Theater owners must take a ""wait and see"" approach for many films.<p>I also don't agree with your 6 month figure, but I'd be happy to be proven wrong.  Release dates are widely published.  Comedies tend to have the slowest rollout because it takes time to prove that the humor translates well.  Even with comedies, I can't find anything where the wide US release is 6 months before foreign releases.",1336502610

Your assertion that it's extremely unlikely that local privilege escalations exist is demonstrably false.

Regarding the statement that if you can't trust localhost then your defences have failed... well, duh. The point is to limit the damage by having multiple layers of defence. If a script kiddie manages to use UltraPWN2000 to get an unprivileged shell on your box, you don't want them to be able to easily just drop all tables if they're not smart enough to use a local privilege escalation (assuming they can compile locally anyway). You won't be able to prevent all damage from a skilled attacker but you should attempt to mitigate it and give yourself time to respond to it.

3945152,comment,3940073,3944343,3,0,fdr,,,"> Some of the people try and get burned because features that MySQL did without anyone noticing now take so much time that one wonders if he triggered some strange bug that caused db to do full table scan where one is unnecessary. Then he goes to the internet and look for clues and he sees response ""oh, it's how it supposed to work, nobody is working on because it does not seem like a problem"" over and over.<p>Just about every non-trivial database implementation will have a pathology that others do not.  In this case, InnoDB is was faster because it supported index-only scans, a feature that was very useful, but hard to implement in PG because of some details of its MVCC implementation -- now there is an implementation in 9.2 that gives it a shot at being in the same class of performance even on wide-row tables.  However, both are still <i>much</i> slower than MyISAM: if you search for ""why is count slow on innodb?"" you'll get a lot of hits -- it suffers much the same defect vs. MyISAM (which has poor SMP concurrency, allowing it to count things as a luxury) that Postgres does.<p>Perhaps ""not a problem"" is a lazy answer for ""it's hard to get exactly right, and nobody in the same class of implementation is bothering, and this has been discussed to death and is more work than you realize, so don't expect anyone to implement it soon unless you intend to argue it (unless you are also a long-term maintainer) and do it.""  As you can see...that was many more words, including giving background on two MySQL storage engines.<p>> Do you know why db can't just keep track of number of entries in a full or partial primary key indexes and use them to give count fast ?<p>It could. But you'd have to spec out a brand new top-level set of utility commands (like CREATE INDEX) to make this physical structure, it now is yet another knob that can drastically change performance characteristics, the planner gets to scan the projections and qualifiers for yet another little optimization, someone else gets to maintain it (unless you are maintainer), and then there's going to be the person that asks ""why isn't is this snapshot-isolated version not even nearly as fast as caching the count in memcached?"" (or, if one does it the other way, the reverse), and then finally when you get around to implementing a more general set of functionality you'll be stuck with this old form for basically eternity (depending on your release policy) much like hash indexes.  Don't forget to add backup-and-restore support, manual pages, and EXPLAIN and/or other diagnostic output, if necessary.<p>On the plus side, it could end the endless howling about this problem.<p>Personally, I think we can get enough hooks in place that someone should be able to implement this secondary structure in a satisfying way <i>without</i> coupling it inextricably into the database, and that's a project I'd have enthusiasm for.<p>If someone else made this feature in another popular database that serves similar use cases and it got used <i>a lot</i>, then I think the understanding of the upsides would be such that such a feature is more likely to happen.  Index-scans fall into that category, and a special structure not seen in other databases doesn't appear to at this time.",1336501651

3945137,comment,3942942,3943974,9,0,Erunno,,,"IIRC both Google's and Mozilla's browser metrics showed that a vast majority of users (>90%) never open more than 5 tabs simultaneously. Chrome is optimized for this use case, both from a memory as well as interface perspective. So for most users it works very well, better than the competition I daresay. Unfortunately it tends to completely break down once you go too far out of its comfort zone (i.e. using many tabs). Unless you have immense amounts of memory (> 4 GB) the gigantic memory use will not only affect Chrome itself but also all other programs as the OS starts swapping their pages onto the hard disk (which have to be swapped back upon access which is <i>slow</i>). Additionally, the interface was clearly never intended to be used with too many tabs as it lacks any kind of tab overflow concept. And the interface starts to lack badly which for me is an indication that there are bottlenecks in the single browser process which handles the UI.<p>Firefox behaves far more gracefully in less regular use cases. With tab groups, switch-to-tab, don't load until selected and tab overflow I can easily have dozens of open tabs without affecting the performance of Firefox and the system too much while remaining quite convenient to use. Mozilla just has to improve the regular use case to be in a better competitive position. Once they've achieved this Firefox will be usable by a far wider range of possible users than Chrome.<p>Oh, and one of the reasons for Chrome's success (besides the sneaky bundling stuff) is probably the extremely convenient silent updater. I've installed Chrome on many computers which belong to people with little technical knowledge so I wouldn't have to bother with  browser updates (users have no say in this) and outdated Flash versions (since it is bundled). Now, the latter reason wouldn't be necessary if Adobe wouldn't be such a bag of fail but that's another topic.",1336501498

Those same drugs- that he determined were medically necessary and he's a DOCTOR, can be bought over the counter in Chile, and many other countries south of the US border.   Walking around chile you don't see a lot of stoners or drug addicts (in fact, I haven't seen any homeless at all) compared to the USA.<p>Nevermind that the person who decided he was writing ""too many"" of these prescriptions has no medical training and was doing so based on what amounts to a quota system whereby over time patients are increasingly denied the drugs they need as their doctors become afraid of the same fate that befell my acquaintance.  This fear causes fewer prescriptions to be written over all, lowering the standard for ""too many"", causing those who didn't deny their patients the drugs they need to be prosecuted, installing more few, further lowering the numbers, etc.  It is a self reinforcing cycle.<p>So, please tell me why a doctor had his life ruined for giving his patients- terminally ill, remember- prescriptions for drugs that you can buy over the counter in many countries?  Please tell me why the USA is pursuing a program that ensures that ill people are in agony?<p>It is because the USA has gone off the deep end in certain areas.<p>Yet attempting to defend this doctor to others who also went to high school with him, mostly got no sympathy.

If everyone is paid equally and has the same benefits, there's no point in working harder or smarter - you just do the bare minimum and be done with it.<p>Let's take a capitalist factory: workers are paid $5 per assembled iPad. Those who want more money can assemble 100 iPads and make $500 in a day's work. Most are happy with $100 per day, so they'll assemble only 20 iPads (let's say that's the minimum amount required).<p>Now a communist, state-operated factory: workers are paid $100 per day because everyone is equal. Those who want to make $500... can't, even if they assemble 1000 iPads. So they just assemble the bare minimum of 20 and are done with it, secretly cursing the government for this injustice/inequality (how ironic is that?).<p>The overall production level drops significantly unless the state raises the minimum amount of iPads made to 100 per day. Obviously, the people who are happy with $100 per day are now pissed off, either because they don't want or simply can't work that hard.<p>The only ones benefiting from communism are those who make the laws and control the factories/country.",1336500359

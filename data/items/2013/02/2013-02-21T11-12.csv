See a lot of trolls would start talking about poverty, malnutrition, etc etc in India, whenever such news is announced.<p>The two point they don't see is:<p>1. Technology is not a object that you can go out and buy, investment always comes at price and a risk, but you never know what you will find, and what are its applications, if you think of it otherwise.<p>2. Similarly, India, is just another country, racing towards socio-economic development, and people are not happy with meeting 10 year old benchmarks. So, when we will achieve certain standards, others (developed countries) would have already moved ahead, and in this race we would be both driving at same speed. This is where scientific discovery/research comes in. Until and unless we device a way to cut short the chase, we will never come par with the developed countries.<p>This is what estonia understands, being a african country, its both behind, developed countries like US, and developing  ones like India. So it recently decided to go 2 steps ahead, and go fully electric for its car industry. Sadly, which is something India doesn't understand. But you get the point.<p>What is being spent on India's space program, is only a fraction, compared to what is being spent on these real problems people are talking about, so stop complaining or go back to stone age!",1361447998

Nokia wouldn't be alone either - Android was well into development when the iPhone launched.<p>It's possible that they'd still use a stylus and a keyboard even now, but that's doubtful too - we'd just started to see the introduction of capacitive touch screens to mobile phones when Apple announced the iPhone (it was the second mobile with capacitive touch by a couple of months).<p>But OK, assuming that those don't take off either, what then for Facebook and Twitter? Well, I can tell you that here in the UK at least there were a whole bunch of mobile providers who spent a fortune on 3G bandwidth and were desperate to make money. They'd be quite happy to come to a deal with companies like Facebook and Twitter to include support for them on their featurephones if it sold upgrades and data bundles.",1361447883

My startup failed about 6-9 months ago. It was a very difficult time, our business partners went back on their promises and with that 3+ years of my life went down the drain. It was a terrible couple of months, lots of lost sleep, high blood pressure, I'm still dealing with it.<p>I was unemployed for a couple of months, then finally took a job at a great company, where I feel great. Things were finally picking up. I thought I was fortunate because I had my wife who supported me through it all.<p>Then a month ago my wife, who I thought would be my partner for life left me.
Bam.
You think a failing company is bad, try this. I just got thrown back to being 25 and looking for a date, sth I thought I left behind me forever. It was I hope the final price I payed for concentrating too much on my startup the preceeding years.<p>Lessons learned? Too many, but I'll just say this. The buddhists are right, the only constant in life is change. Shit will happen to you, whether you're rich or poor. Companies will go under. You may lose money. You will be fired from jobs. Your partner may not turn out to be who you thought she is. Somebody close to you could get sick. Your parents will die. It's just life. You have to accept these things will happen and do your best to prepare for them.<p>It's though, some people are much better at it than others, but it's normal if you can't get over these things in a day or week. Medicine might help (eg. sleep, anxiety), but go easy with that stuff.<p>Don't lie to your parents. They're your safe harbour, they will understand and help you. Tell them what's going on. I'm 32 and although it doesn't feel very manly, talking to my parents about my current situation is what's keeping me sane.",1361446183

   to explain myself.""
</code></pre>
Why? The only appropriate response to being informed that you are not permitted to take pictures in a non-public space is ""I understand"" or simply ""Okay"". No explanation is necessary as it won't change the rule that the flight attendant is likely obligated to enforce. However, the author feels compelled to justify himself rather than just let it be by saying:<p><pre><code>  ""I want you to understand why I was taking pictures. I hope you
   didn't think I was a terrorist. Here is my business card
   [offering her one]. I write about United Airlines on an
   almost-daily basis and the folks at United in Chicago are even
   aware of my blog.""
</code></pre>
This is quite ambiguous. The flight attendant is probably thinking ""Oh great, here's some critic who is going to scrutinize and complain about everything I do and then write about it publicly. If he's so notorious that the guys in Chicago are aware of him, he must be bad news. Is he telling me this to try and con me into letting him take more pictures? Some disgruntled self-important writer is the last thing I need..."". Imagine how the response might have been different had he said:<p><pre><code>  ""Sorry about taking that picture. I just want to say that I love
   United and everything you guys do. I'm really excited about being
   in BusinessFirst class on this new aircraft and wanted to capture
   the moment. Thanks for letting me know about the photography
   restriction, though. I respect that and won't take another
   picture.""
</code></pre>
But again, that whole exchange should never have happened. Then later, this gem of a sentence:<p><pre><code>  ""Me: That's a lie, captain.""
</code></pre>
Ouch. Now the only way to get your way is for both the captain and the flight attendant to lose face and admit that, yes, it was a lie. What was he expecting? That the captain brings the flight attendant over and asks her ""Did you lie?"" where she responds ""Yes, Captain, I lied about this passenger taking additional pictures because I was afraid that he might write about a negative experience with me."" I could go on with how the conversation with the captain should have gone, using face-saving phrases like ""she may have been mistaken"" and such, but at that point the battle was long since lost.<p>None of this excuses the flight attendant's alleged retaliatory action. However, having the situation escalate to that point could easily have been avoided.",1361445985

There's some stuff that seems similar to the way I work and some stuff that is completely different.<p>Like for you, you process math as a visual representation of what's happening. For me, math is just a written language. I don't see anything, I just read it, write in it, and think it when neccesary.<p>If there's something I can't understand without a diagram I can try to imagine one, but I usually just draw one. To imagine a system it's like 'speaking with my hands'(or like I've read that sign language works), I arrange the symbols in space, I know where they are in relationship to each other and how they interact. This set is over here, its members go through this function over there, ends up in this bucket here.  I guess it's more symbolic and spatial than visual. It's like building a factory or some other kind of apparatus out of symbols that have various relationships or interactions.<p>All of this happens as I move symbols around on paper or the screen also. It's how I learned how to do math in my head as a kid, repeating things to myself and placing symbols in space.<p>I also have a strong inner monologue. I tend to think mostly in language but there's also a 'compiled' component, in that when I've really processed something just the symbol is enough.. they don't necessarily have names, I can't put a name to them. In my internal monologue they're just spaces that are filled with feelings I guess. So f(x), that I've internalized might be something like ""So, when we put ___ through ___(this one is f) we'll get..""<p>I suppose sometimes I have no idea what the hell I'm thinking about in terms of a specific symbol and it stands for some computation I haven't completed but I can see how to complete.<p>I wish I had started with functional programming and lambda calculus, thunks and lambdas seem to map pretty closely to my software.<p>I also love just when I nod off to sleep, but mainly because that's the best time for me to think.

Various users tend to use the notoriety of their username as a club in discussion, and to be honest, act like pompous asses. Their opinions are held in higher regard, not because the words are thought out or relevant, but simply because people know who they are.<p>So my suggestion is fairly simple: for each thread, assign people a randomized hash for the conversation to show instead of a username. The hash persists for all their posts in that thread so that you can follow back-and-forth between users, and clicking on the hash will still take you to their user page, but the initial ""this was said by XXXX, so it must be an important opinion"" would be broken.<p>As the hash is still tied to the user account, hopefully people wouldn't start acting like they're fully anonymous (it's just a random, very thin mask, after all), but what they say won't be held in massively high regard just because of their username (instead of what they say actually being worthwhile).",1361444895

It is important to stress that this critique is begging the question. The crucial question is of course whether or not people realize that the classic version is hard. That is, the control version presents the easier statement that participants are supposed to be unconsciously substituting. What we want to know is whether or not people note this substitution. If people do not notice it, then the two problems should be isomorphic and they should be considered equally hard. In other words, arguing that people notice that the classic problem is harder than the control problem underscores the point that they are not oblivious to the substitution.""<p>I'm not sure quite how convincing I find that, for two reasons. Firstly, since it's possible to ask equivalent questions in different ways, it seems like someone might (1) genuinely think the question they've been asked is the same as the easy one, but (2) have found it harder to parse or something. Secondly and (I think) more importantly, isn't it possible that <i>asking people about their level of confidence</i> provokes extra reflection? Participants may have substituted obliviously, but then -- only when asked ""how confident are you in this answer?"" -- realised on some level, to some extent, that something wasn't quite right.",1361444856

Also US and Russia have already been there. There is also a huge problem of poverty, corruption and every other social evil known to man exists in India. So why go to mars?<p>For a country of India's size, you will never ever go to space if you wait till all other problems are solved. Because given the very size and population of India, problems are a given. Of course a mission of this importance will serve your usual technology and science benefits. Like ISRO's previous mission to moon, there will be important findings and discoveries. But besides this, its a matter of huge national pride.<p>Contrary to whatever you may think a lot of development and great work happens in India. So its not like we only have call centers, or IT services companies here. We have everything from Nuclear weapons development to Mars missions in India. And like every other country we would like to send out a message that we can do it too.<p>Sounds naive and childish?<p>No, if you think from an Indian's perspective. I find this project a worthy endeavor in many ways because it serves more than one purpose. Growth of technology and science, inspiring the youth to work further in this area, ensure India earns well deserved respect in the global space research community and also pave the for further space exploration.<p>Coming to budget, 454 crore spent for a project of this importance is chicken feed if you ask me. Besides if you can prevent one minor scam in our country you can run a project like this.<p>Overall I feel this is an amazing project, and I feel proud that my country is executing it.",1361444783

5256734,comment,5252054,5255556,6,0,joelmichael,,,"The early church had many disagreements, especially over observance of Jewish law such as circumcision. But the Judaizers (as they are called) essentially lost the debate, which Paul was active in, and the Church became rather Gentile-oriented. Many other things were up for dispute as well, such as the exact nature of Jesus, but these were ultimately ironed out under ecumenical councils which ratified certain dogmatic truths such as the Trinity. Beginning with the First Council of Nicaea in 325 AD, convened by Constantine, Rome sought to define Christianity properly and began to eradicate all heretics, such as Arianism and Catharism, though some remote groups such as the Copts evaded them due to being out of their jurisdiction.<p>Christianity thus maintained relative internal consistency under the Roman Church, and spread throughout Europe, until around the year 1000 when the Greek Orthodox split off from the Catholics. However, they still maintain very similar dogmas (including that circumcision is unnecessary).<p>Martin Luther did his work in the 16th century which caused a great deal of schism in the Church; until this time Protestants did not exist. King Henry VIII abandoned Catholicism and invented Anglicanism. All of these people nonetheless still believed circumcision was not necessary and it was not generally practiced in Europe, and many of their liturgical beliefs were much more aligned with traditional Catholicism than modern evangelicals.<p>It wasn't until the US, with its enormous variety, lack of traditional oversight, and radical re-interpretation of the Bible by individuals, that circumcision regained some religious significance in fringe groups. Pentecostalism in particular did not start until the 19th century. However, after looking around, I can't find any evidence that even they universally see circumcision as a religious requirement for Christians. Some Christians practice it anyway, but not as a religious requirement. Incidentally, so do many atheists.<p>I think it can be said that not only the New Testament but almost the entire history of Christianity is against circumcision being a religious requirement. There was disagreement in the early church, and there is disagreement in some fringe groups today, but it was never a mainstream view.",1361444424

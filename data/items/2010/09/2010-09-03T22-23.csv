1661431,comment,1661271,1661395,0,0,patio11,,,"So one of the projects paying the rent this summer was working for a client which markets college degrees.  They asked me to crunch some government data and figure out what degrees are worth on a per-major basis.  While I'm mostly done and paid (yay), the project isn't live yet, or I'd show it off.<p>I think they'll be OK with me saying this much: the data do not agree with your conclusion, for any sensible value of ""liberal arts.""<p>Now photography, that is another story.  My research methodology totally missed it as a major choice, because the obvious occupation (photographer) <i>doesn't require a degree</i>.  Looking at the BLS source data though, egads, $170k to become a photographer is a bad call economically.  The median annual salary (note: for photographers at all stages of their career) is $19k.  The overwhelming majority are part time only.  If you give generous assumptions as to future income growth, the NPV of being a photographer is $410k.<p>That compares disfavorably with <i>every</i> degree I actually have in the data set.  (Including, most relevantly to her situation, the associate's degree you need to become an X-ray technician, which you can get for less than $5,000.  Spend another $10,000 on camera lenses, bam, you're an X-ray technician doing something she loves <i>as a hobby</i>.)",1283554786

1661427,comment,1649114,1661148,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"If you had been following the issue back then, you would recall that Lomborg spent a good part of his book disputing the significance and credibility of 'climate change,' essentially suggesting that many adherents of the the theory preferred doom-mongering to solving any present problems. He and his book were extremely popular among skeptics at the time; I got tired of being (metaphorically) beaten over the head with it. Look at the media articles archived at the bottom of the wiki article for a list of contemporary articles documenting his popularity among skeptics.<p>By 2007 he had moderated this position substantially, but still held to the view that climate change was such a large-scale issue it was beyond our economic scope to really mitigate, and we should instead follow strategies of adaption. This latest news is noteworthy in that he is now saying that it can be mitigated, it's important enough to be mitigated, and that it won't be all that expensive to do so.<p>But hey, don't believe me. take it from Lomborg himself:<p><i>The Skeptical Environmentalist<p>In The Skeptical Environmentalist Bjørn Lomborg challenges widely held beliefs that the global environment is progressively getting worse. Using statistical information from internationally recognized research institutes, Lomborg systematically examines a range of major environmental issues and documents that the global environment has actually improved.

What you have said implies that you don't care about story line, realism of physics simulation, gameplay, etc., which I'm quite certain is simply not objectively true of the gaming marketplace. Even if you think it's the ""3D"" that matters, then things were vastly better in Quake than Duke Nukem, where you could look directly up and down without bad distortion etc.<p>And then, one needs to ask, what quality is it of the 3D that matters? Simple things like decent texture scaling (trilinear filtered mipmapping, anisotropic filtering etc.) and antialiasing make a big difference, but are often only viable at high resolution in 6-month old games with the latest hardware, such are the demands of the processing.",1283554314

Maybe in Florida things are different.<p>Most kittens will never survive.  We ""had"" one very feral cat.  She would not even touch food we left out, until she was 20 years old and had cataracts in both eyes.  Her secret to a long life?  Dump all the kittens.  Don't even let them nurse if you can help it.  She had a dozen litters over the years.  Most all died within two months, the lucky few lasted six.  We buried all the ones we could find.

A few months later ID Software published Quake, which was also mind bending. I don't feel like FPS have evolved at all since that time.

Einstein was looking towards intuition to <i>explain</i> the physics and the experimental reality, while they were looking for <i>mathematical models</i> which seemed to fit the experimental data, while providing no understanding of what it all meant.
Once Heisenberg & Schrödinger made a big break into QM, it's like all of physics jumped on it and forged ahead, damn whether anyone <i>understands</i> what is really happening.<p>Even Schrödinger himself, in his own first paper presenting his wave mechanics formulation, said there is no hope of visualizing nor understanding what Psi really represents. It's all just <i>empty</i> mathematical symbols, that when manipulated according to a particular set of rules, within a particular context, will give somewhat accurate predictions about some physical experiment. It really doesn't help at all the the entire QM apparatus is just plain ugly, inelegant and incapable of justifying itself. I'm not condemning it, nor any of the enormous geniuses who tossed their own contribution onto our <i>great, immeasurable & eternal bonfire of accumulated human knowledge which we call science</i>.<p>But if you read through a few grad-level books about QM, it's blindingly obvious that nobody really knows what's really going on. This is more of a consequence of our current gaps in mathematics, more than a failure of any individuals. Believe me, once someone discovers how to solve The Eigenvalue Problem in quadratic time, all of QM, as it is currently formulated, is going to go away and be replaced by a much simpler model. It'll be just as simplifying as centuries ago when we replaced Ptolemy's epicycles with Kepler's elliptic orbits.

Health=micronutrients/kcal is a useless approximation. Implies that if you reduce kcal by switiching to more micronutrient dense foods, you'll always be healthier. Which is untrue (there are problems such as starvation, hypervitaminosis, drinking saltwater would be a great idea...) and highly depends on a plethora of other factors.<p>It's pseudoscience.<p>(And I say that as a future MD who also does science based sports/nutritional consulting, so be assured I know of the importance of diet and exercise in disease&health.)

Every village in Germany, France, Britain has a monument in it with long lists of names of men who died. Today we can all move freely, work together, share ideas, in many cases even share the same currency, etc. That sometimes causes friction, people like to complain, and newspapers run the occasional sensationalist headline to sell copies. The reality is literally millions of EU citizens now travel in, do business with, interact with, study in, and (in the case of EU elections) even vote in each other's countries. We've come a very, very long way. It has become so normal it almost isn't mentioned any more. Does that mean everything is perfect when different cultures meet? No, of course not. But at least we're not killing each other anymore.<p>I hope next year when we reach the 100th anniversary of WWI (the sheer scale of the carnage is difficult for us to even fathom today) more is made of how far we've come.

</code></pre>
is easier than<p><pre><code>    post.publish! Time.now
</code></pre>
Since when you publish, the time of publication is the only value that make sense. Now, you can argue that you can set a default argument to Time.now, but that's weird code that only make sense if you need to supply a value other than Time.now, which you will only do in testing, so the code in DHH's example is optimal.<p>The point of DHH's blog post is, in a flexible enough language like JS, Ruby and Python, you can still test pretty much anything without DI. I honestly don't know any other reason why one would want to use DI other than making Java testable. In fact, you don't even need that in Java anymore because you can use Mockito these days and it can mock private stuff.<p>The stupidest reason I keep hearing over and over again is DI makes it possible to change an implementation at runtime. Wait what? Don't you have to change the application.xml file in Spring and restart the app? AFAIK there's nothing in Javaland that lets you listen to config file changes and then magically reconfigure the app context and make a copy of said context as a thread local in every new thread. Correct me if I'm wrong please.

</code></pre>
than<p><pre><code>    post.publish
</code></pre>
When the publishing will only happen <i>now</i>?<p>I'm a Ruby developer who disagrees with DHH strongly on this issue, as well as his stance on SOLID and testing.  I also have years of experience in C#, using TDD and using dependency injection and IoC containers everywhere.  However,  I think there's a point to be pulled from DHH's post about unnecessary ceremony around dependency inversion (the more important thing) and static languages.<p>If I were to write this ""publish"" method in C#, I couldn't even put it in the Post object.  It all looks fine and dandy now, but what happens when the first wave of change comes in?  Say, if we were to have to stamp an ""updated_by"" field?  Then we get to this:<p><pre><code>    def publish(time, updated_by)
       self.update publish_at: time, updated_by: updated_by
    end
</code></pre>
And so on, and so on.  The dependencies have to be passed to the object, so every dependency flows up to become dependency on any object that uses it.  And since having method calls like "".publish(Date.now, CurrentUser.name)"" everywhere really stinks for readability and DRY, and since I can't make Date.now a constructor requirement to create a Post, I always found myself having to do this (in C#):<p><pre><code>    public class PostPublisher
        private IDate date;
        private ICurrentUser;
        public PostPublisher(IDate date, ICurrentUser){
            this.date = date;
            this.currentUser = currentUser;
        }

        public void Publish(post){
           post.updated_by = currentUser.name;
           post.published_on = date.now();
           // save????
        }
    }
</code></pre>
... and let the IoC container wire this sort of stuff up. Dependencies tied to this operation are isolated (as well as every other operation). But UGH, is this any better?  So many classes and LOC just to do simple things.<p>I just don't see a good solution to this, and I'm not satisfied writing ""good"" code that handling is a pain.  I decided to <i>try</i> Ruby as it seemed to have answers for this, and it does.<p>You can call the ability to use the Date object and still change it a ""global variable"" or ""linguistic flexibility,"" but the truth is:  In the applications we write, published_at is only going to be set to Date.now and updated_by to the currently logged in user.  And as soon as we write the application and deploy, it will serve the business needs wonderfully.  As a C# developer, I justified the costs of doing these end-arounds as necessary to maintain a TDD'd codebase that could easily be changed later.  As a programmer, though, I can't justify the costs of writing dozens of lines of code when I can TDD <i>one</i> line of code.  And I sure as heck don't want to eat the costs myself.

The documentation supplied with App Studio is truly appalling, covering basic commands and functions only, and even then, not fully.  The moment you want to dig deeper there is no help for you and even the writers of App Studio say ""Search the Internet for answers"".  This makes App Studio a 'development' system for amateurs.<p>If your intention is to develop anything that remotely resembles a professional application then I am very sorry to say you will have to use something else.<p>I speak as a professional developer of 30 years experience, having developed on all sorts of platforms.  We recently completed a project (not the way we wanted to due to the limitations) using NS Basic App Studio and it took a whole year to make.  The equivalent in almost any other environment would have taken a matter of weeks.  There were times when my team and I wanted to blow our brains out in frustration, mainly with the woeful documentation and zero support offered by NS Basic.<p>NS Basic bill App Studio as a Visual Basic-like environment.  Do you remember the days when IBM clone-makers were saying that their machines were compatible to the IBM PC and it turned out they meant they both use a 5amp fuse in the plug?  Well that is how App Studio is to Visual Basic.  Whilst App Studio uses the BASIC language, it is so far removed from VB when you start wanting to do anything interesting that it makes the comment ""Visua Basic-like"" a mockery at best and misleading at worst.",1357557513

Who knows). It's aired twice every day except Sunday (when they air all episodes for the whole week in one go). Like every soap, it will end every episode with a carefully-timed emotional cliffhanger. Episodes are filmed well in advance, but edited fairly close to the actual airing date, to avoid too many plot-leaks. Hence, episodes can be slightly longer or slightly shorter, and they usually make up for it by cutting the credits reel (which starts with the famous ""tum-tum-tututum"" sound you hear in the video); nobody cares about that, of course, so I guess programmers are just guaranteed ""at this time there will be credits"", which is not enough for the ""electricity watcher"" because people will fire up their kettles as soon as credits roll.<p>Cutting short actual EastEnders footage to accomodate some abstract timing issue would result in <i>a lot</i> of angry calls to the BBC!",1357557077

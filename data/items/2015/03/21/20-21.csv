Joining a nation meant joining the religion; moving elsewhere meant (often) adopting another religion.<p>Jews, after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, found ways to keep the religion going even in the absence of national sovereignty or a centralized religious authority.  But the notion of a &quot;people of Israel&quot; kept going, such that anyone who converts to Judaism is considered a 100 percent member of the people, not just a convert.<p>Jews who meet up with other Jews around the world have long seen one another as long-lost members of a large family, with a common language (Hebrew), history, and tradition.

Community is crucial to Jewish survival.  So among other things:<p>- You need 10 adults to have many important prayer services<p>- You need to eat kosher food -- which is only feasible when there&#x27;s a critical mass of other Jews around<p>- Women need to go to a ritual bath once a month; it&#x27;s only feasible to have such a ritual bath if you live near other Jews who help to fund it<p>- You can&#x27;t carry on the Sabbath <i>unless</i> you have an eruv around your community, in which case you can carry within the community.<p>These, together with other rules, have the effect of encouraging Jews to live near other Jews, which helps to strengthen the community more and perpetuate the tradition.  I think that much of Jewish law is aimed at this underlying goal.

Every war since then has been a relatively limited one in the sense that no one on the home front really made any kind of sacrifice or even any substantial contribution to the war effort. In World War II, as much of the country&#x27;s productive output as possible was dedicated to the war effort. Civilian consumption was strictly rationed, and the population actually went along with this. People gardened and learned to get by with less because every gallon of gasoline they didn&#x27;t burn, every tire they patched up instead of replacing, every bit of food or cloth or wood or steel that you didn&#x27;t needlessly consume could be shipped off to the front lines and contribute to victory. Every dollar you saved could be invested in war bonds. There was hardly a single American who lived through that war who didn&#x27;t make sacrifices and materially contribute to victory.<p>If you were able to get that level of dedication out of the population again, you could scale an effective military force in very short order the way the US did in WWII.

Making ways to bind together rods and board into shelves for example, or what not.

But just for a second, compare to the situation with, say, traditional Chinese medicine versus modern medicine.  A situation where we have multiple orders of magnitude better understanding today, and the <i>only</i> thing the traditional way has going for it is that it&#x27;s had quite a lot of time to gather empirical data.  Traditional medicine may sometimes produce effective treatments (along with a huge amount of snake oil placebo), but it&#x27;s essentially dumb luck combined with a semi-effective selection process, whereas modern medicine, though far from perfect, creates and proposes treatments on a drastically more detailed, and essentially rational and correct basis.<p>How long will it be (if ever) before we can say the same about neuroscience?<p>How will the world change then?",1426968885

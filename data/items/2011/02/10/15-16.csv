(simple X$/mo or advanced- multiple plans, upgrades downgrades, add-ons, coupons, dunning, multi-currency support etc) - this is typically the first step in the build vs. buy eval.<p>Secondly - you need to evaluate your own available time/resources. Most eng. projects require 2x original estimate...you can easily apply 5-10X for billing since even the most talented developers don't get it 'right' the first time (add PCI and ongoing customer support + gateway recourse to your total estimates). The best developers can usually 'get it working' - but then realize they end up spending tremendous time to 'get it working well'.<p>Third - [Assume now you're buying vs. building] You need to choose a service that gives your business room/flexibility to grow. Many businesses decide to change gateways at some point - when new business needs emerge - [multi-currency support, better rates, customer support]. Don't hem yourself in by choosing a service that doesn't store your card data, and let you easily switch gateways. Numerous horror stories exist on this topic - won't cover here. Also important, don't choose ANY service that won't commit to returning your customer credit card data if/when you decide to leave them. [Braintree was a leader in this area, and Recurly fully supports the Data Portability Standard as well].<p>Compare core feature capabilities AND 'high frequency use' capabilities of available recurring providers. Core features might be: add-on support, upgrade downgrade + proration, customizable emails, API documentation + API behaviors, Push notifications for sync to your systems, free trials, coupons etc.  \n'High frequency use' aspects include reporting, data exports, third party integrations, account dashboard + common customer support functions (can you easily credit, refund, charge, modify info, upgrade/downgrade) from any customer account page. This is a critical aspect and most evaluations fail to consider what it will be like to actually 'live with' a vendor's solution.<p>Lastly, the payment processor options + combinations. \nMerchant Bank Accts - (We really like FeeFighters.com for helping entrepreneurs to choose a merchant bank).<p>Payment Gateways - Your payment gateway decision should be made not just on fees alone, but also consider the kinds of error fidelity you will receive (How many error/decline messages and what type of info is returned). Another important consideration is multi-currency support. Does your business need to accept many different kinds of currencies from around the world? (Dramatically improves conversions if you don't force your customers to pay in $USD). PayPal does a better job with currency conversion than just about any other gateway (For US companies). Some gateways will require you to be incorporated in each country you would like to accept currencies from..<p>Most importantly, talk to customers from your prospective recurring billing provider. The 'Net promoter score' opinions are very palpable across vendors. Don't just take the 'reference' customers provided by the vendors, but do your homework and you'll find quickly where the raving fans are.<p>Hopefully this was helpful, balanced, fair and objective.<p>-Dan",1297353599

Seeing that on TV, in turn, helped get the really big crowds out to Tahrir Square a couple of days later.<p>Much more recently, they pulled off a similar feint to establish a second encampment.

Anonymous craves leadership but resents authority, so it's crucial to appear indistinct from the super- or trans-human whole while prodding the herd in your desired direction lest you pop the illusory bubble that gives it strength. This is not unlike what Jaron Lanier calls the ""oracle illusion"", by which something like Wikipedia gets much of it's percieved authoritativeness by scrubbing out any trace of individual authorship. Anonymous tells Anonymous what to do and Anonymous generally does it.<p>For instance, the most interesting thing about a thread like this[1] is the timestamps, because they give you a rough idea of how many Anons are actually participating. Two and three minute gaps between posts is an eternity on /b/, the kind of thing you see when a thread hasn't gotten much attention and is likely to die. What I am saying is that many (perhaps most) of the posts (even apparently dissenting ones) in the above thread are likely to have been the same person, persistently bumping an overlooked thread, waiting for it to gain traction.<p>Of course there is no way to prove this, and one can more easily perceive this is a vibrant conversation between a much larger group of people (which also can't be proved). Whether this was intentional or not, it is an easy way for a vocal minority to recruit from the largely apathetic majority. The perception of being part of a group has an enormous impact on getting people to participate[1].<p>Not only does anonymity amplify the power of ""leaders"" in this way it also reflects the yearning of the ""followers"" to be relieved of the burden of an individual identity or responsibility. As Eric Hoffer describes in <i>The True Believer</i>:""Those who see their lives as spoiled and wasted crave equality and fraternity more than they do freedom. If they clamor for freedom, it is but freedom to establish equality and uniformity. The passion for equality is partly a passion for anonymity: to be one thread of the many which make up a tunic; one thread not distinguishable from the others. No one can then point us out, measure us against others and expose our inferiority.""<p>That isn't to say that Anonymous consists uniformly of maladjusted poltroons--it doesn't, by a long shot, nor are they generally fanatics in any but the most temporary sense--but it's not controversial to say that it harbors a large population of disaffected youth and misfits of every stripe.

Now if i want to share this article, i usually have a ""share"" option which sends the intent to the OS. Depending on the registered applications it let's me send this article via mail or twitter or sms or even bluetooth (or really whatever app supports this intent). After deciding i want to send this as mail to a friend the mail activity opens up, let's me send it and seamlessly send me back to right where i was (reading the article). This is integrated throughout the whole OS.<p>Now, if i am reading some rss article in Pulse on my iPad, i have two options: Use the facebooks-share button of Pulse. Ok, but if i want to mail it or the app doesn't offer that at all? I'll have to copy the URL, close pulse, open the mail app, write the mail, close the mail app, open up pulse again.<p>Another example is: Google places offers me a restaurant i want to visit. Now depending on the apps i have installed i can use google maps, some other navigation software or the public transport app i have to show me the way to get there. It makes the user experience quite seamless, despite the applications not ""knowing"" of each other. I don't have to write down the adress, open up some other app, enter the adress again.<p>It's also the way to replace core functionalities of the UI. Want another home application? When pressing the home button on the device it's firing an intent and this can be handled by some home app of your choice. Same for the search button.<p>The nice thing about intents is that it's very flexible. Depending on the apps i have installed it offers me interaction between those apps.<p>About JIT: If you want to believe Wikipedia, JIT is no JVM originated feature but was invented somewhere in the 60s.\nI find it quite hard to imagine how the Dalvik JIT could be a real rip-off of the JVM JIT, as those are based on quite different architectures. The only thing in common is that they both use the same syntax.<p>About Open Source: I may be corrected here but it's perfectly possible to have a working phone by taking the sourcecode from android. It will have a running kernel, a working UI, i can install apps and live with it. What would be missing would be gmail or the android market. But there are other markets and other mail applications.\nCould you please point me to where i can find a compilable open source version of iOS?",1297351925

In speaking with job prospects recently, it seems like very few companies (~ 5%) are open to some type of remote work. Now please understand, I am not looking to work remote b/c I want to live in the French Riviera.

Take this awesome recruiter email to me:<p>-- start email ----<p>I am a recruiter here in the Bay Area working with several significant consumer-focused internet tech companies.\nWhat's going on in the Bay Area right now (and why I am writing you) is a major shortage of qualified Ruby engineers. For that reason, there are Ruby openings at probably 30-40 of my portfolio clients (seriously); additionally, I am seeing much higher salaries in this area because of the shortage and increased demand in the market caused by increasing venture investment in startups and more dev teams adopting RoR.\nThis all boils down to you.\nThe reason I'm writing is that I would like for you to seriously consider the possibility of looking at a new full time role as a Rails dev in San Francisco. Is this something that you would be open to?\nSome of the most innovative companies in the country are here in the Bay Area.

The best engineers are often the highest paid (cash-wise) in the company.<p>The reason good PMs are paid highly is because they use leverage to create more value across the organization than they can provide as a single contributor. A great BA or PM guides the whole project and the whole team, making a group of people more efficient by properly prioritizing their work and getting more value for each hour worked. A great PM measures these results, and shows the difference they make. A great PM tunes the product to the customer.<p>Great PMs are held accountable for the product and its success in the marketplace. Great PMs can't do their jobs without great engineers and respect that fact.<p>You only need one great PM for every 5 great engineers, so you can be more discerning about who you hire and how much you pay them.

The NDK is used for games and 3d applications or to access libraries that are coded in c++ already.<p>Another question is will you also have to make your app availalable to blackberry or other devices such as an ipad.  If so then phonegap rhomobile appcelarator and sencha touch, jqeury mobile yada yada yada might work best because theyre focus really is one having one codebase be able to be used on multiple platforms.<p>If you only have to target the iphone and android and you have a mac and want to learn how to code each then just go native.

Initially i was looking at phonegap, titanium and rhomobile.  The problem with them is each has pros and cons and its very confusing to really understand what they are.  Theres also fanboys of each which makes it even more difficult to understand what separates each.<p>You can also go the jquery mobile/sencha touch/mobile rails route which is the direction i am going somewhat myself.  These are actually pretty nice and fairly powerful for a basic application.  Although jqeury mobile is newly developed as is mobile rails whereas sencha touch is pretty mature.  Theres also jquery touch but i dont really know that much about it.<p>The question really comes down to what is the application doing.  If you are doing a game you have to go native unless you can do something with html5 canvas.  Also if you need to use something like gps or the camera or the accelarator you have to go either native or use phonegap, appcelarator or rhomobile as html5 through just a mobile browser cant give you access to the hardware.<p>What ive been ending up doing is just using straight jquery because im familiar with it and then seeing where my apps need to go.",1297350053
